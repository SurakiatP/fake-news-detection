Stumpf, and its former head of community banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. The clawbacks  \u2014   or forced return of pay and stock grants  \u2014   are the largest in banking history and among the largest in corporate America. A   committee of Wells Fargo\u2019s directors investigated the extensive fraud. Wells Fargo\u2019s board said in a report issued on Monday that Mr. Stumpf had turned a blind eye to the fraudulent accounts being created under his nose and that Ms. Tolstedt, who ran the branch system, had focused obsessively on sales targets and withheld information from her boss and the board. Wells Fargo\u2019s misdeeds, which came to light in September, have at least temporarily become a more widely recognized symbol of the bank than its signature stagecoach. Bankers across Wells Fargo\u2019s giant branch system were tacitly encouraged to meet their sales goals by committing fraud opening unwanted or unneeded accounts in customers\u2019 names and, sometimes, moving money into and out of the sham accounts. While the amount of money customers lost was relatively small  \u2014   the company has refunded $3. 2 million  \u2014   the scope of the fraud was huge: 5, 300 bankers were fired for creating as many as two million unwanted bank and credit card accounts. In one detail revealed by the report, a branch manager had a teenage daughter with 24 accounts and a husband with 21. The warning signs were glaring and could be traced back at least to 2004, the investigators said. Ms. Tolstedt, who ran the national network of Wells Fargo branches, set up ruthless sales goals that even she acknowledged were unreachable. Mr. Stumpf, who had a long and trusting relationship with Ms. Tolstedt, left her on her own to run her department, the investigators said in the scathing   report. Neither Ms. Tolstedt, who was allowed to retire in July but was subsequently fired, nor Mr. Stumpf, who was permitted to retire in October after being castigated during congressional hearings on the scandal, was available on Monday to comment. Mr. Stumpf cooperated with the board\u2019s investigation Ms. Tolstedt declined to be interviewed. All told, Mr. Stumpf will surrender $69 million, and Ms. Tolstedt will lose $67 million, including stock options that they forfeited last year. While those figures are bigger than any previous bank clawback, they fall far short of the largest clawback in corporate history. In 2007, William W. McGuire of UnitedHealthGroup was forced to give back $618 million over backdating options. Ms. Tolstedt\u2019s lawyer, Enu Mainigi of the Washington firm Williams  Connolly, issued a statement challenging the board\u2019s findings. \u201cWe strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt,\u201d Ms. Mainigi said. \u201cA full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion. \u201d The board\u2019s report, compiled by the law firm Shearman  Sterling after interviews with 100 current and former employees and a review of 35 million documents, said it was obvious where the problems lay. Structurally, the bank was too decentralized, with department heads like Ms. Tolstedt given the mantra of \u201crun it like you own it\u201d and granted broad authority to shake off questions from superiors, subordinates or lateral colleagues. Many things collectively should have raised suspicion, the report said. Customers were failing to fund, or put money into, their new accounts at alarming rates. Regional managers were imploring their bosses to drop sales goals, saying they were unrealistic and bad for customers. Particularly in Arizona and Los Angeles, where the toxic culture was most pronounced, some managers explicitly told subordinates to sell people accounts even if they did not need them. Because of the bank\u2019s decentralized structure, the problem went unnoticed for a long time. When it finally came to light  \u2014   thanks in part to an investigation by The Los Angeles Times  \u2014   the bank was slow to take action. Mr. Stumpf was warned as early as 2012 about \u201cnumerous\u201d complaints about the company\u2019s sales tactics  \u2014   from both customers and employees  \u2014   but he ignored growing evidence that the problem was pervasive, the board said in its report. Much of the   climate, the report said, stemmed from Ms. Tolstedt, who led Wells Fargo\u2019s retail branch network for eight years. The report casts her as a powerful and insular leader who set unreasonable targets, castigated those who criticized them and actively ignored signs that some managers and employees were cheating to meet them. \u201cShe resisted and rejected the near unanimous view of senior regional bank leaders that the sales goals were unreasonable and led to negative outcomes and improper behavior,\u201d the report said. Timothy J. Sloan, who succeeded Mr. Stumpf as chief executive, was largely exonerated by the report, even though he was also a career Wells Fargo executive. As president and chief operating officer, he became Ms. Tolstedt\u2019s immediate supervisor in November 2015. At that point, the report said, he \u201cassessed her performance over several months before deciding that she should not continue to lead the community bank. \u201d Mr. Stumpf, who retired in October, exercised all of his remaining options and converted them to stock  \u2014   which he retained  \u2014   in the months before Wells Fargo announced its $185 million settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Los Angeles city attorney in September. He held 2. 5 million shares as of late February, currently valued at $137 million. Asked about the timing of Mr. Stumpf\u2019s options exercise, Stephen W. Sanger, the board\u2019s chairman and the leader of its investigation, said at a news conference on Monday that it was a routine move that did not raise concern. The $28 million that the board is taking back from Mr. Stumpf  \u2014   the proceeds of a 2013 equity grant  \u2014   will be deducted from his retirement plan payouts, Mr. Sanger said. Nearly all public companies have clawback provisions, but boards are typically loath to invoke them. Wells Fargo\u2019s example may inspire future directors, said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware and an expert on corporate governance. \u201cI welcome the move,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a shareholder of Wells Fargo, and I\u2019m glad they did it. \u201d Mr. Sanger took over as the board\u2019s chairman from Mr. Stumpf. All four members of Wells Fargo\u2019s independent investigation group were on the board before the settlement was announced. The report depicted the board as hoodwinked by bank executives who withheld important facts. It praised the changes the bank had made recently, which include ending sales goals for its retail bank employees. Such conclusions are unlikely to quiet the bank\u2019s critics. Better Markets, a nonprofit organization that advocates stricter regulation of Wall Street, called the report a compendium of \u201c    cosmetic actions\u201d and called on shareholders to oust all of Wells Fargo\u2019s board members at the company\u2019s annual meeting on April 25. Two influential advisory firms have also recommended significant changes to the company\u2019s board. Mr. Sanger said that the report issued on Monday concluded nearly all of the bank\u2019s investigation and that no further terminations or clawbacks were expected. But other investigations  \u2014   including criminal inquiries by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general  \u2014   remain in progress, raising the possibility of criminal charges. The board\u2019s law firm is still looking into reports that the bank retaliated against former employees who tried to blow the whistle on its wrongdoing. Last week, a federal regulator, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Labor Department, ordered Wells Fargo to rehire and pay $5. 4 million to a former employee who said he was fired after making internal complaints about wrongdoing that he had observed. The agency has also warned Wells Fargo that it is likely to order the bank to reinstate another worker who said she was fired in 2011 after trying to call her supervisors\u2019 attention to accounts that she said had been fraudulently created. So far, Shearman  Sterling has found no evidence of retaliation, said Stuart J. Baskin, a partner at the firm. \u201cWe still have a few loose ends, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely to change any findings,\u201d he said. Wells Fargo is eager to put its sales scandal behind it, but customers are not quite so willing to move on. The number of consumer checking accounts opened in February dropped 43 percent compared with a year earlier, and credit card applications declined 55 percent. The financial damage caused to customers by Wells Fargo\u2019s fraudulent acts was relatively minimal, but the issue has loomed large in the public imagination in part because the bank\u2019s transgressions were so blatant  \u2014   and so simple. \u201cPeople getting accounts they didn\u2019t sign up for?\u201d said Stephen Beck, the founder of CG42, a strategy company that studies banks\u2019 brand perception. \u201cI don\u2019t need an M. B. A. in finance to understand that\u2019s wrong. Our expectation is that it is going to take quite a bit of time for Wells to recover. You can\u2019t just advertise \u2018Trust me,\u2019 which is what they\u2019ve tried to do so far. \u201d Mr. Sloan, the bank president, said at a news conference after the report was issued that he had some regrets about how the bank\u2019s leadership  \u2014   and he in particular  \u2014   had handled the years of warnings. \u201cIn hindsight, I wish we would have taken more action and would have done things more quickly,\u201d he said. The bank\u2019s sales incentives should have been eliminated sooner, he said.'"}, "time": 1742564149.643157}
