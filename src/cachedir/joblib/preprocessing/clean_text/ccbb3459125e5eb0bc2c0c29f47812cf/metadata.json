IT was like one of those magical   scenes out of a Hollywood   without the \u201crom. \u201d I met Brian, a New York screenwriter, a few years ago through work, which led to dinner with our wives and friend chemistry that was instant and obvious. We liked the same songs off Dylan\u2019s \u201cBlonde on Blonde,\u201d the same lines from \u201cChinatown. \u201d By the time the green curry shrimp had arrived, we were finishing each other\u2019s sentences. Our wives were forced to cut in: \u201cHey, guys, want to come up for air?\u201d As Brian and his wife wandered off toward the No. 2 train afterward, it crossed my mind that he was the kind of guy who might have ended up a groomsman at my wedding if we had met in college. That was four years ago. We\u2019ve seen each other four times since. We are \u201cfriends,\u201d but not quite friends. We keep trying to get over the hump, but life gets in the way. Our story is not unusual. In your 30s and 40s, plenty of new people enter your life, through work, children\u2019s play dates and, of course, Facebook. But actual close friends  \u2014   the kind you make in college, the kind you call in a crisis  \u2014   those are in shorter supply. As people approach midlife, the days of youthful exploration, when life felt like one big blind date, are fading. Schedules compress, priorities change and people often become pickier in what they want in their friends. No matter how many friends you make, a sense of fatalism can creep in: the period for making B. F. F. \u2019s, the way you did in your teens or early 20s, is pretty much over. It\u2019s time to resign yourself to situational friends: K. O. F. \u2019s (kind of friends)  \u2014   for now. But often, people realize how much they have neglected to restock their pool of friends only when they encounter a big life event, like a move, say, or a divorce. That thought struck Lisa Degliantoni, an educational   executive in Chicago, a few months ago when she was planning her 39th birthday party. After a move from New York to Evanston, Ill. she realized that she had 857 Facebook friends and 509 Twitter followers, but still did not know if she could fill her party\u2019s invitation list. \u201cI did an inventory of the phases of my life where I\u2019ve managed to make the most friends, and it was definitely high school and my first job,\u201d she said. After a divorce in his 40s, Robert Glover, a psychotherapist in Bellevue, Wash. realized that his roster of friends had quietly atrophied for years as he focused on career and family. \u201cAll of a sudden, with your wife out of the picture, you realize you\u2019re lonely,\u201d said Dr. Glover, now 56. \u201cI\u2019d go to salsa lessons. Instead of trying to pick up the women, I\u2019d introduce myself to the men: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go get a drink.\u2019 \u201d In studies of peer groups, Laura L. Carstensen, a psychology professor who is the director of the Stanford Center on Longevity in California, observed that people tended to interact with fewer people as they moved toward midlife, but that they grew closer to the friends they already had. Basically, she suggests, this is because people have an internal alarm clock that goes off at big life events, like turning 30. It reminds them that time horizons are shrinking, so it is a point to pull back on exploration and concentrate on the here and now. \u201cYou tend to focus on what is most emotionally important to you,\u201d she said, \u201cso you\u2019re not interested in going to that cocktail party, you\u2019re interested in spending time with your kids. \u201d As external conditions change, it becomes tougher to meet the three conditions that sociologists since the 1950s have considered crucial to making close friends: proximity repeated, unplanned interactions and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other, said Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This is why so many people meet their lifelong friends in college, she added. In the professional world, \u201cproximity\u201d is hard to maintain, as work colleagues are reassigned or move on to new jobs. Last year, Erica Rivinoja, a writer on the NBC series \u201cUp All Night,\u201d became close with a woman, Jen, when they worked together on a pilot. Almost instantly, they knew each other\u2019s exercise schedules and food preferences. Jen could sense when Ms. Rivinoja needed a jolt of caffeine, and without asking would be there with an iced tea. \u201cBut as soon as the pilot was over, it was hard to be as close without that constant    interaction,\u201d said Ms. Rivinoja, 35. They can occasionally carve out time for a quick gin and tonic, she said, but \u201cthere aren\u2019t those long afternoons which bleed into evenings hanging out at the beach and then heading to a bar. \u201d The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues, Dr. Adams said. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins. Differences in professional status and income also complicate matters. \u201cIt really does get weird when your friends are making tons more than you, or tons less,\u201d said Adriane Duckworth, a former marketing executive now working as an artist in Hamilton, Ontario. She recently welcomed a promising new couple into her circle of friends, but they quickly turned people off with their obsession with money. \u201cAt our wedding, other friends of ours who were seated with them actually complained to us afterward about the couple who was asking everyone how much money they made,\u201d said Ms. Duckworth, 32. \u201cPeople who made less felt uncomfortable discussing it, and people who made the same or more just felt it was weird to talk about it so nonchalantly. \u201d Once people start coupling up, the challenges only increase. Making friends with other couples \u201cis like matchmaking for two,\u201d said Kara Baskin, a journalist who works in Boston. \u201cNot only are you worrying about whether the other woman likes you, you\u2019re also worrying if her husband likes you, if your husband likes her, if your husband likes him. \u201d Not long ago, she invited her husband\u2019s new work buddy over for dinner with his wife. But the wife was visibly unimpressed by Ms. Baskin\u2019s   home (they had just moved in) and   spaghetti dinner. \u201cIt was basically clear that his wife had been cajoled into attending,\u201d said Ms. Baskin, 33. \u201cShe settled on to our rickety Ikea kitchen chairs like she was lowering herself into a coal mine. \u201d The couple departed quickly after dessert. The next day at work, the husband made an excuse about his wife being tired. \u201cBut it was unspoken that we wouldn\u2019t be seeking their company again,\u201d Ms. Baskin said. ADDING children to the mix muddles things further. Suddenly, you are surrounded by a new circle of parent friends  \u2014   but the emotional ties can be tenuous at best, as the comedian Louis C. K. related in one   routine: \u201cI spend whole days with people, I\u2019m like, I never would have hung out with you, I didn\u2019t choose you. Our children chose each other. Based on no criteria, by the way. They\u2019re the same size. \u201d Even when parent friends develop a bond, the resulting friendships can be fleeting  \u2014   and subject to the whims of the children themselves. Caryl Lyons, an event planner in Danville, Calif. and her husband found a budding friendship with a   couple hit a roadblock when their young sons, who had been close friends, drifted apart. When the families planned a barbecue together, her son would say, \u201cCan I have my other friends over?\u201d said Ms. Lyons, 44. External factors are not the only hurdle. After 30, people often experience internal shifts in how they approach friendship.   gives way to   so you become pickier about whom you surround yourself with, said Marla Paul, the author of the 2004 book \u201cThe Friendship Crisis: Finding, Making, and Keeping Friends When You\u2019re Not a Kid Anymore. \u201d \u201cThe bar is higher than when we were younger and were willing to meet almost anyone for a margarita,\u201d she said. Manipulators, drama queens, egomaniacs: a lot of them just no longer make the cut. Thayer Prime, a    strategy consultant who lives in London, has even developed a playful   scale (100 being \u201cbest friend forever\u201d). In her mind, she starts to dock new friend candidates as they begin to display annoying or disloyal behavior. Nine times out of 10, she said, her new friends end up from 30 to 60, or little more than an acquaintance. \u201cYou meet someone really nice, but if they don\u2019t return a call, drop to 90, if they don\u2019t return two calls, that\u2019s an immediate 50,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re late to something in the first month, that\u2019s another 10 off. \u201d (But people can move up the scale with nice behavior, too, she added.) Having been hardened by experience, many people develop a more fatalistic view of friendship. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you define what it really means to be friends in a more serious way,\u201d said my screenwriter friend, Brian. (His full name is Brian Koppelman, and he wrote and is a   of \u201cSolitary Man,\u201d a 2010 film starring Michael Douglas about a   man trying to reconnect with friends and family.) \u201cMy ideas of friendship were built by \u2018The Godfather\u2019 and \u2018Diner,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cYour friends were your brothers, and anything but total loyalty at all costs meant excommunication. As you get older, that model becomes unrealistic. \u201d By that point, you have been through your share of wearying or failed relationships. You have come to grips with the responsibilities of juggling work, family and existing friends, so you become more wary about making yourself emotionally available to new people. \u201cYou\u2019re more keenly aware of the downside,\u201d said Mr. Koppelman, 46. \u201cYou\u2019re also more keenly aware of your own capacity to disappoint. \u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t really changed my standards for what it means to actually be friends,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I use the word \u2018friends\u2019 more loosely. Making the real kind, the brother kind, is much harder now. \u201d Some, like Ms. Degliantoni, the   executive, simply downsize their expectations. \u201cI take an extremely efficient approach and seek out   folks to fill very specific needs,\u201d she said of her current strategy. \u201cI have a cocktail friend and a book friend and a parenting friend and several basketball friends and a neighbor friend and a workout friend. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s much easier filling in those gaps in my life,\u201d she added, \u201cthan doing an exhaustive approach for a new friend. \u201d Or, they hit rock bottom and turn back the clock to their breathlessly social 20s. After a move to New York in his 30s, Dave Cervini, a radio station executive, was so lonely that he would walk his cat in Central Park, hoping to stoke conversations. Finding only curious stares, he decided to start the New York Social Network, an activities group for people to find friends by hanging out at Yankees games or   mixers. The company now counts 2, 000 members, most in their 30s. He considers 200 of them close friends. \u201cIt takes courage for people to take the first step,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, I make it easier, having been there myself. \u201d  In that spirit, I recently called Brian. We joked about our inability to find time to hang out, and made a dinner date at the next available opening. It is three months from now.'"}, "time": 1742564156.5087366}
