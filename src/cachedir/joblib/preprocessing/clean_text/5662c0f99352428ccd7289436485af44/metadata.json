Otherwise, it was going to be two old guys rolling around on the floor of the steakhouse, and that would be pretty unseemly,\u201d recalled Mr. Mullin, 64, the mustachioed senior writer for Enid\u2019s daily newspaper, The Enid News  Eagle. The dispute was not personal. It was, of all things, editorial. Mr. Mullin\u2019s red newspaper in a red county in what is arguably the reddest of states went blue this campaign season and endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. The editorial board, in a   column on Page A4 on Oct. 9, wrote that Donald J. Trump lacked \u201cthe skills, experience or temperament to hold office. \u201d The headline and subhead read: \u201cFor U. S. president: Hillary Clinton is our choice for commander in chief. \u201d It was the first Democratic endorsement for president in the modern history of the newspaper, which was founded in 1893. As the man\u2019s reaction at the steakhouse suggested, Enid was stunned, and this   agricultural town of 52, 000 near the Kansas state line has not been the same since. The News  Eagle, with a circulation of 10, 000, lost 162 subscribers who canceled the paper. Eleven advertisers pulled their ads, including a funeral home that had a sizable account. Someone stuck a \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d bumper sticker on the glass doors of the paper\u2019s downtown office. A man left a   message on the publisher\u2019s voice mail, expressing his hope that readers would deliver, to put it delicately, a burning sack of steaming excrement to the paper. Around the country, as newspapers big and small are struggling to keep subscribers, a handful of papers with conservative editorial boards made news by either endorsing Mrs. Clinton or urging readers to back anybody but Mr. Trump. Among them were The Dallas Morning News and The Fort Worth  . The Arizona Republic in Phoenix received death threats after it endorsed a Democrat for president for the first time in its   history. Yet for the most part, the fallout at those large metropolitan newspapers was   and barely noticed. The  \u2019s editorial in October, \u201cSay No to Trump,\u201d led to more than 100 canceled subscriptions, less than   of 1 percent of its circulation. In Enid, however, sentiment about the endorsement lingers weeks after the election. A former mayor, Doug Frantz, 72, withdrew his participation in this year\u2019s Pillar of the Plains events, which are sponsored by the paper and honor community leaders and volunteers. Emails, letters, phone calls and comments denouncing the endorsement have poured into the paper\u2019s website and Facebook page,  and online, the editorial logged more than 20, 000 page views the week it was published, making it one of the most viewed articles to ever run on Enidnews. com. Days after the editorial, Paul Allen, 81, one of Enid\u2019s most prominent residents  \u2014   he financed construction of the ballpark downtown  \u2014   stepped into the paper\u2019s offices on Broadway. He walked past the statue of an eagle in the lobby and canceled his    subscription at the front desk. He might have done it sooner, but hesitated because he knows the publisher, Jeff L. Funk, whom he sees at weekly Rotary Club meetings. \u201cI like Jeff a lot,\u201d said Mr. Allen, a   of a meat processing company that is the largest private employer in town. \u201cThat was one reason I debated it, because I didn\u2019t want to offend him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gloating over it,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just felt like it was kind of my duty almost. When I saw that headline, I was shocked. It was sickening to me. \u201d The News  Eagle\u2019s   editorial showed the raw power of partisanship in   America, the extraordinary divisions exposed in this election and the surprising ways in today\u2019s digital media age that newspaper endorsements still have the power to generate a reaction, even if they don\u2019t necessarily change people\u2019s votes. \u201cThere used to be a saying that the editorial page was the soul of a newspaper, and if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ve got a lot of   newspapers in the country because they\u2019re afraid to offend anybody,\u201d said Terry M. Clark, the director of the Oklahoma Journalism Hall of Fame and a professor of journalism at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond. \u201cThis is an excellent example of the way American journalism ought to be  \u2014   standing for something  \u2014   and, man, it takes guts to do that in Enid, Okla. \u201d The News  Eagle, which urged readers in the Republican primary to support Senator Marco Rubio for president, stands by its endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. But it has also been busy doing damage control. One reader who stopped taking the paper said it was still trying to woo him back by delivering an occasional copy to his doorstep. The executive editor, Rob Collins, has worked the phones, talking to subscribers who had canceled or threatened to do so. \u201cI talked a lot of people off the ledge,\u201d said Mr. Collins, who grew up in Enid and whose father was a respected car salesman. \u201cPeople knew my dad or know my mom and know my family here. A lot of people who were angry called expecting me to argue right back with them. Really, the only time I would raise my voice is when I would get cursed at or yelled at, which I don\u2019t really like. \u201cI hope people can respect that we\u2019re entitled to our opinion, too, and that that can be different from news,\u201d he added. The editorial took shape from notes that Mr. Funk, the publisher, supplied to Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins refined the notes and was the primary author of the endorsement, which was debated and approved by the paper\u2019s   editorial board. The paper\u2019s corporate parent, Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. which is based in Alabama and owns newspapers and websites in 23 states, also played a role. \u201cIt was our decision at the corporate level, which of course was made known to all of our papers, that Donald Trump did not meet our company and journalism values, particularly as they related to the First Amendment,\u201d said Bill Ketter, the senior vice president for news. Asked if the Enid editorial board had the freedom to endorse Mr. Trump, he replied: \u201cLet me put it this way. We would have been disappointed. Did we demand that they do something? No, we didn\u2019t do that. We set out our principles and our standards. \u201d Enid is roughly 100 miles north of Oklahoma City, and people here still like to debate whether the town gets its name from a character in a Tennyson poem or, according to urban legend, from a joke played on an old chuck wagon sign. (Enid is, after all, \u201cDine\u201d spelled backward.) The jets from Vance Air Force Base fly so low that residents like to say they can read the markings on the bottoms of the aircraft. Several residents said they now depended on the newspaper\u2019s competitor, The Enid Buzz  \u2014   an online and social media hub for community news and activities  \u2014   for their local news, and they disputed any suggestion that canceling subscriptions was too strong a reaction. \u201cI\u2019m unhappy with the whole media,\u201d said Jody Traynor, 67, a   subscriber who stopped taking the paper after the endorsement. \u201cAll of them. They lean too much. They\u2019re supposed to just tell me the news and let me decide. \u201d All 77 counties in Oklahoma went for Mr. Trump. The last Democrat to carry the state was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, while the last one to carry an Oklahoma county in a presidential election was Al Gore in 2000. Still, there are Democrats in Enid, at least one of whom was pleased with the situation. \u201cWe gained one subscriber out of the endorsement editorial,\u201d Mr. Funk said. \u201cWe lost 162, but we gained one. \u201d At Western Sizzlin that Sunday, Mr. Mullin ended up ordering a   steak and a baked potato without further incident, but the confrontation disturbed and puzzled him. He and his wife attend Willow View United Methodist Church, as do members of the man\u2019s family. \u201cLooking back on it, I think it was all talk, but at the time I thought there was a possibility that he might take a swing at me,\u201d said Mr. Mullin, a member of the editorial board. \u201cAnd I thought this is crazy. This is a newspaper endorsement. Some of the people almost seemed hurt. Like, \u2018How can my newspaper\u2019  \u2014   in a small town like this, it\u2019s their newspaper  \u2014   \u2018do this to me?\u2019 I think there was almost a sense of betrayal. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563549.5323882}
