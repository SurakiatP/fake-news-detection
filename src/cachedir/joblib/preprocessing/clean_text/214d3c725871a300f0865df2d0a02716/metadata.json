Recall our post from last week, \u201c Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary\u2019s Benghazi Hearing \u201d in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton\u2019s Benghazi testimony? \\nIt was Peter Kadzik. \\nIn other words, the best friend of John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s Campaign char, at the DOJ will be in charge of a probe that could potentially sink Hillary Clinton. \\nFor those who missed it, this is what we reported: \\nThe day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary\u2019s campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. \\nThe post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee. \\nPodesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta\u2019s home, another email shows. Another email sent on May 5, 2015, Kadzik\u2019s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. \\nAs the Daily Caller noted , the dinner arrangement \u201cis just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state\u2019s email practices.\u201d As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign\u2019s \u201ccozy relationship\u201d with the Obama Justice Department. \\nThe hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta\u2019s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik\u2019s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. \\n\u201cThe political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don\u2019t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,\u201d says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton,\u201d he added, comparing the Podesta-Kadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. \\nKadzik\u2019s role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. \\nIt gets better because, as we further revealed, if there is one person in the DOJ who is John Podesta\u2019s, and thus the Clinton Foundation\u2019s inside man, it is Peter Kadzik. \\nKadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a \u201cfantastic lawyer\u201d who \u201ckept me out of jail.\u201d \\nPodesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. \\nRichardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. \\nPodesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation . But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. \u201cHe did lie to me,\u201d Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. \\nPodesta had been promoted to Clinton\u2019s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. \\nKadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that \u201cKadzik was recruited into Marc Rich\u2019s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.\u201d \\nThe report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich\u2019s pardon. On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich\u2019s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon . She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. \\nKadzik\u2019s current role \\nIn his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. \\nBut Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation. \\nIn a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained \u201cthat special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest.\u201d \\nDeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynch\u2019s appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obama\u2019s political appointees \u2014 a list which includes Kadzik \u2014 \u201care being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.\u201d \\nIt is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantis\u2019 questions. \\nKadzik\u2019s first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. \\nKadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBI\u2019s files of the Clinton email investigation. \\n* * * \\nAnd now it seems that Kadzik will be in charge of the DOJ\u2019s \u201cprobe\u201d into Huma Abedin\u2019s emails. Which is why we are a little skeptical the DOJ will find \u201canything\u201d of note. \\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .
