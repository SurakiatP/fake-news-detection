Only 12 other performers have held the title, which they earned by winning an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. (According to Vanity Fair, the acronym was coined in the 1980s by the \u201cMiami Vice\u201d actor Philip Michael Thomas, who has won none of the awards. It was repopularized by Tracy Morgan\u2019s character on the sitcom \u201c30 Rock. \u201d) Mr. Miranda\u2019s Oscar nomination, his first, is for the song \u201cHow Far I\u2019ll Go\u201d from \u201cMoana. \u201d It will compete against two songs from \u201cLa La Land,\u201d one from \u201cTrolls\u201d and one from \u201cJim: The James Foley Story. \u201d If he wins, Mr. Miranda would join such performers as Helen Hayes, Audrey Hepburn, Whoopi Goldberg, Mel Brooks and Mike Nichols. The Tony Awards have been a stumbling block for many entertainers: Kate Winslet, Martin Scorsese, Randy Newman and, somehow, Julie Andrews, lack only Broadway\u2019s highest honor. At 37, Mr. Miranda would be the youngest person to have won all four awards. His song, \u201cHow Far I\u2019ll Go,\u201d is a tribute to ambition and adventure, celebrating themes similar to one of Justin Hurwitz\u2019s nominated songs, \u201cAudition (The Fools Who Dream),\u201d from \u201cLa La Land. \u201d \u201cHow Far I\u2019ll Go\u201d has been adapted into 44 languages, including a version sung by the Canadian pop star, Alessia Cara, on the film\u2019s soundtrack. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Miranda thanked the academy and his collaborators on the film and congratulated all the nominees. \u201cFuture congratulations to the kids watching the telecast this year, singing along with their favorite songs, performing epic private concerts for the mirror with a comb or a toothbrush microphone,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re next. \u201d Last fall, when Mr. Miranda was asked about the possibility of winning all four awards, he pointed out that there were brilliant artists who had not won a single award. \u201cThere are great works of art that won nothing. And Vincent Van Gogh died penniless,\u201d he said. \u201cAwards are not a maker of excellence. \u201d \u201cBut they\u2019re really cool,\u201d the interviewer, from the awards news site Gold Derby, said. \u201cThey\u2019re cool,\u201d Mr. Miranda said. Mr. Miranda has two Grammys, one for the cast recording to his 2008 Broadway musical \u201cIn the Heights\u201d and another for his smash hit \u201cHamilton. \u201d He has personally won three Tony awards (and his musicals have collected many more). He won an Emmy for his work on the music and lyrics at the 2013 Tony award show. It is, of course, an honor to collect all four awards  \u2014   or even one of them. But the ambition to do so was mocked memorably on the \u201c30 Rock\u201d episode \u201cDealbreakers Talk Show #001,\u201d in which Tracy Jordan, the character played by Tracy Morgan, decides that it is his dearest ambition to win all four awards, transforming the acronym into a verb: to EGOT. \u201cThat\u2019s a good goal for a talented crazy person,\u201d Mr. Morgan says. If he wins, Mr. Miranda will join an even more rarefied group: EGOT performers who also have Pulitzer Prizes. The composers Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch have won all five. Mr. Miranda, uniquely, has also received a MacArthur Fellowship.'"}, "time": 1742562086.4012856}
