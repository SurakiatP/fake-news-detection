[The Telegraph reports police \u201cdiscovered a working bomb factory with a huge stash of explosive chemicals and other components\u201d.  A security source who spoke to the newspaper offered a warning:\u201dThe worry is there was enough to build two or three bombs and we can\u2019t rule that out. \u201d It is believed the Manchester Arena bomb was assembled by Abedi himself, with David Videcette, a former Metropolitan Police constable who participating in the   investigations, saying he probably learned his deadly craft overseas. \u201cThis is not something you can just put together by reading a book or watching a YouTube video,\u201d he said. \u201c[Abedi] will have spent time at a camp somewhere, possibly in Libya, being shown how to do it. \u201cBut once you have the skills and the materials, assembling the device itself can be done fairly quickly. \u201d Islamist groups gained rapidly in power and influence in Libya after a   military intervention, led by former Prime Minister David Cameron and former President Barack Obama, toppled Colonel Muammar Gadaffi. Abedi\u2019s father Ramadan, a Libyan migrant granted refugee status in Britain, returned to his native country shortly before Gaddafi\u2019s death. He has since been connected to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) a jihadist organisation linked to   and proscribed by the U. S. The British Government has not implemented or pursued a ban on travel to and from countries like Libya, meaning Abedi was free to visit Ramadan there prior to carrying out his attack. Ramadan now been detained, along with Abedi\u2019s younger brother Hashem, by the Special Deterrence Force  \u2014   a   militia which is itself described as a hardline Salafist organisation. He had been an administrative manager in Tripoli\u2019s security forces. Abedi\u2019s sister, also in Libya, declared that her brother \u201cdid what he did in revenge, and in love for Islam\u201c.'"}, "time": 1742563286.4753387}
