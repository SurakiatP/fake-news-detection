Here is another translation of the same interview as well.) \\nWe will certainly welcome anyone who wants to work with us, and no, we are not interested in quarrelling constantly with anyone, which only creates threats to oneself and the world, or at the very least makes it harder to achieve the desired results in the fight against terrorism. \\nWe do not know what will happen after the election. We do not know whether or not presidential candidate Trump will follow through on his intentions, how far he will go in cooperation with us, whether Ms Clinton will stick to her harsh anti-Russian rhetoric if she is elected President, or maybe she will also adjust her position. We cannot know this now. \\nI will repeat this again: sacrificing Russian-American relations for the sake of internal political events in the US is harmful and counterproductive. \\nHe\u2019s always so full of reason. I like the way that he speaks without having to remember which opinion is public and which is private. Russia uses the US as a scapegoat for plenty of things but they generally seem to have good intentions, even if they conflict with ours.'"}, "time": 1742564389.701408}
