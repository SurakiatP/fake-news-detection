Iraqi officials were taken aback by the directive, which they learned about through the American news media because they had not been consulted first. The order blocks citizens from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. That lumps Iraq together with Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, nations with no strategic alliance with Washington. \u201cThe effect is that many Iraqis will feel that the United States does not want a   relationship with Iraq,\u201d said Lukman Faily, who completed a   stint as Iraq\u2019s ambassador to Washington in June. \u201cWe hope it is a blip. It makes it difficult for us to decipher what President Trump is up to with regard to Iraq. \u201d Mr. Faily has been directly affected by the order. Though he holds dual British and Iraqi citizenship, he said information he had received from the American Embassy in Baghdad indicated that he would not be allowed to travel to the United States in the coming weeks to participate in a   conference, he said in a telephone interview from Iraq. The edict followed inflammatory comments that Mr. Trump made during a visit to the C. I. A. this month, in which he said that the United States should have \u201ckept\u201d Iraq\u2019s oil after the   invasion and might still have a chance to do so. More broadly, it clashes with a memo that Mr. Trump issued on Saturday calling on the Pentagon to submit a new plan for stepping up operations against the Islamic State, including by empowering \u201ccoalition partners. \u201d With Iraq furnishing the ground forces for the coming assault on western Mosul, and with more than 5, 000 American troops in the country, the political support of Baghdad is essential. But current and former American officials are worried that the directive will have a corrosive effect on   relations at a critical stage in the fighting. \u201cMy brothers in Iraq\u2019s Army, who I proudly fought with, are fighting ISIS tonight,\u201d Mark Hertling, a retired Army lieutenant general who led American forces in northern Iraq, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Iraqi govt is now winning. And we ban their citizens?\u201d The order, which administration officials said was drafted without the input of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Middle East experts at the State Department, has offended the Iraqis in several respects. During the Bush administration, the United States and Iraq signed a Strategic Framework Agreement, which calls for close diplomatic, economic and security ties and is still in effect. \u201cIf I were an Iraqi, I would be waving this signed agreement in the face of the current administration,\u201d said Ryan C. Crocker, who negotiated the accord and served as the United States ambassador to Iraq under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \u201cIt is totally inconsistent. \u201d Iraqis who are already skeptical about Washington have also seized on the order to stir up opposition against the United States. Moktada   the fiery cleric whom many Iraqi Shiites support, accused the United States of \u201carrogance. \u201d \u201cSo get out U. S. citizens from Iraq before you expel communities from U. S.,\u201d he said on Twitter. To contain the political damage, officials said a   call between Prime Minister Haider   of Iraq and Mr. Trump might be arranged for this week. Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, but neither Saudi Arabia nor the Emirates are covered by the new order. Iraqi officials who are close to the Americans worry that the Islamic State will exploit the policy in its propaganda to recruit new volunteers. As of early Sunday, the terrorist group had made no official pronouncement. However, individual members and supporters have been sharing the order and news articles about it. Yet another worry has been expressed by veterans, and even members of Mr. Trump\u2019s own party: that the order will interrupt the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have worked closely with the Americans and have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection. \u201cThe people we need to accomplish the mission are nervous, and rightly so, that our country is going to turn our backs on them,\u201d said Steve Miska, a retired Army colonel, who spent 40 months and three deployments in Iraq. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans who have been strongly supportive of the military, expressed concern that a strict application of the order might even block Iraqi pilots from coming to the United States for training. \u201cThis executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies,\u201d they wrote in a statement issued Sunday. The more fundamental question is whether the White House can balance the fulfillment of a campaign promise to carry out \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of citizens from Muslim countries with the need to maintain strong ties with Muslim partners in its fight against the Islamic State. The air bases that the United States uses to bomb the group are all in Turkey or Arab countries, as are American troops. \u201cThe president\u2019s actions on refugees and immigration are certain to backfire,\u201d said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \u201cThe policies validate the terrorists\u2019 claim that we are at war with Islam, and will alienate our Middle East allies and isolate American Muslims here at home. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628586.746735}
