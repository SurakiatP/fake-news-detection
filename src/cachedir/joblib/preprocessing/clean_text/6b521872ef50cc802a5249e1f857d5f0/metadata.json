But, you have to do it better than Maria Daly, who was busted last week for that very act. \\nAccording to CBS Boston, police say on October 17 Maria Daly reported a burglary at the family home, saying jewelry and money had been stolen. She also reportedly said her house was tagged with graffiti that appeared to reference the Black Lives Matter movement. \\nAfter investigators looked at the supposed crime scene, however, they quickly determined the entire account was false. \\n\u201cSomething wasn\u2019t quite right,\u201d said Millbury Police Chief Donald Desorcy. \u201cI think that was pretty obvious and as a result of that investigation, the officers did their due diligence and followed through with the investigation that we had.\u201d \\n\u201cBasically we came to the conclusion that it was all fabricated,\u201d said Desorcy. \u201cThere was no intruder, there was no burglary.\u201d \\nAfter Daly robbed and vandalized her own home, she reported it to police and then went on social media to decry the \u2018hatred\u2019 against her husband from Black Lives Matter. \\n\u201cWe woke up to not only our house being robbed while we were sleeping , but to see this hatred for no reason,\u201d she said. \\nNaturally, chief Desorcy quickly exonerated Daly\u2019s police officer husband, noting that he had no role in the deception. Whatever you say chief. \\n\u201cShe must have tagged the place herself,\u201d one neighbor said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d do that if you\u2019re gonna stage a robbery, I mean really come on, you\u2019re a cop\u2019s wife. You should know better.\u201d \\nMaria Daly faces charges of filing a false police report and misleading a police investigation, according to CBS Boston. \\nPeople vandalizing their own property to blame Black Lives Matter is not an isolated incident. \\nA man who accused Black Lives Matter activists of vandalizing and spray-painting his car was recently arrested because police believe that he vandalized the car himself to stage a hoax and to scam his insurance company. Scott Lattin, a self-described supporter of police, reported in September of 2015, that his truck was torn apart and tagged with the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d Lattin alleged that his vehicle was targeted because he had a number of pro-police stickers and symbols displayed. \\nLattin\u2019s story received national press, and he even appeared on a number of news programs where he showed the damage that was done to his truck. However, shortly after the hype, Whitney police arrested Lattin on a misdemeanor charge of making a false police report. \\n\u201cWe had initial video when the officers took the report and then when we saw your story on Channel 4. When we looked at those two videos, there were some differences in those and that led us to take the investigation into a different direction,\u201d Whitney Police Chief Chris Bentley said, adding that the case was \u201cvery disturbing.\u201d \\nLattin was apparently so excited about going on TV he further vandalized his own truck, more so than what was initially reported. When police noticed the extra damage on the TV report, they knew he was lying. Share'"}, "time": 1742563228.1852973}
