However, if these guys, these British Legion guys, if they were to offer a small financial gesture of friendship, then perhaps we would be able to forget the political implications of wearing a symbol of remembrance and the whole situation could be resolved without any need for\u2026unpleasantness.\u201d \\nThe row began after FIFA refused permission for the England and Scotland players to wear a poppy symbol on their shirts because, unlike the Nike or Puma logos, there is literally no money in it. \\n\u201cI looked into it,\u201d continued Don Infantino. \\n\u201cThese poppy guys brought in over a mil last year, and that\u2019s pure untaxed profit. Now we ain\u2019t asking for much over here, just a taste is all. A gesture. But in Euros, none of that worthless Sterling rubbish. \\nAlthough negotiations are currently amicable, there were indications that things could become less so. \\n\u201cHey, we\u2019re all friends here but if, you know, if we can\u2019t all get along,\u201d said Mr Infantino with a smile that didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to make them an offer they can\u2019t refuse.\u201d Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!
