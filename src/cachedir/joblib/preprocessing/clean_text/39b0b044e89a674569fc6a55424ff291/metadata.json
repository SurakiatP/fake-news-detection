Maybe you already reclaimed the space and they\u2019re sitting in an attic long-forgotten. Hopefully you didn\u2019t throw them out, though, as it turns out there might be quite the market for some old tapes. Modern directorial practice for movie releases and re-releases tends to include adding or editing the film from the theatrical version. While some people don\u2019t mind or even enjoy these changes, for others, the original cut is worth a hefty price tag. This translates to listings on eBay for certain tapes at astronomical prices, like one particular Beauty and the Beast tape going for $9,999. The original Beauty and the Beast did not include the song \u201cHuman Again\u201d; it was cut for space reasons, then re-added to the 2002 special edition. However, Disney tapes in particular might be valuable to collectors for other reasons. Reddit user Reddit_Executive speculates that, because of the specific branding on original releases, these movies could go for quite a bit: \u201cOn the spines of some VHS (and BetaMax) tapes is a black diamond with Walt\u2019s signature on it. This was Disney\u2019s first attempt to market their videos to homes. Because of this, certain Disney collectors are convinced that these VHS tapes are worth something.\u201d While it\u2019s possible some tapes are indeed worth quite a bit, many of the movies listed are actually selling for much less. Still, if your plan for your old VHS tapes begins and ends with \u201ctrash them,\u201d there\u2019s no harm in doing your research on what they might be worth. \\nSource:'"}, "time": 1742628596.180313}
