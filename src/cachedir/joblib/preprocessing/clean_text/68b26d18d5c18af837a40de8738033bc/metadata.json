Such was the case on Sept. 16 at the Brooklyn bistro 21 Greenpoint, formerly known as River Styx. It was reopening, under the same owners, with a new menu and a new look. Most    nights are intimate affairs. Not this one. There were camera crews on the sidewalk and a line of people stretching from Greenpoint Avenue nearly to the East River. The restaurant\u2019s   Homer Murray, had let it be known that there would be a special guest bartender on duty that night: his father, the actor and urban folk hero Bill Murray. But at 7:15 the    star of \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d and \u201cLost in Translation\u201d had yet to arrive for a shift scheduled to begin at 7. From inside 21 Greenpoint, the younger Mr. Murray and the restaurant\u2019s bar director, Sean Patrick McClure, a veteran of Le Bernardin and Dirty French, kept an eye on the growing crowd. Asked to describe his father\u2019s bartending skills, Mr. Murray said: \u201cHe just kind of pours Slovenia Vodka into people\u2019s glasses when they look thirsty. He\u2019s about efficiency.   . \u201d The throng seemed to press against the doors shortly before 7:30, and the owner decided to open for business, although the main attraction had yet to appear. At 8:05, Bill Murray stepped in at last. The place lit up with smartphone flashes as he moved toward the bar. Those not occupied with capturing his likeness for their Instagram accounts gave him a round of applause. His first order of business was to grab a bottle of Slovenia Vodka from behind the bar. He twisted off the square black cap, poured a shot into it, drank it and placed the cap on his head to big cheers. Then he got to work. People who shouted the names of complicated cocktails got nowhere fast. But when someone said, \u201cMezcal, rocks,\u201d the guest bartender served it up chop chop. Mr. Murray was equally quick with tequila shots, for himself and for anyone who asked. As he went about his business, he sang along to the music  \u2014   \u201cDisco Inferno,\u201d Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cHigher Ground,\u201d The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cMiss You\u201d and \u201cStreet Fighting Man. \u201d One man asked him if he knew how to make a Bellini. \u201cI know people who do,\u201d Mr. Murray said. He refused another man\u2019s order until, at Mr. Murray\u2019s request, the guest removed his hat. Mr. McClure had whipped up a cocktail in honor of the restaurant\u2019s reopening, mentioning that he had yet to come up with a name for it. Mr. Murray took a sip of the drink, eyes closed. Then he turned to Mr. McClure and said, \u201cThe  . \u201d And so it shall be known. (Recipe below.) The orders kept coming. Smartphones kept flashing. Mr. Murray slid a bourbon shot toward one patron, saying, \u201cOld   will make you feel more intelligent. \u201d When a fellow bartender was in the middle of making a cocktail, Mr. Murray swiped the jigger and drank its contents. A bit later, he said, half under his breath, \u201cI\u2019m making nothing in tips. \u201d A group of firefighters entered the place, hoping for a photo with the special guest. Mr. Murray took a pineapple from the bar and cradled it like a baby as he posed with them. As the evening wore on, he left his station briefly and nearly bumped into a young woman. As if to make up for his lapse, he put his hands on her shoulders, kissed her on the nose and told her she was beautiful. Around 10, the music cut off, and Mr. Murray gestured toward the   with the drink he held in his hand. \u201cThis is my firstborn son, Homer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I am so happy for myself, and his brothers and sisters and mom, and all of you, that he has not continued in the family business. Instead, he has taken the joy of the family  \u2014   to have a drink, and to have a meal, and to have friends together in one place  \u2014   and made it his life\u2019s work. To my son, and his friends, and his work, and all his partners. Homer Murray!\u201d More cheers from the crowd. Mr. McClure praised Mr. Murray\u2019s performance. \u201dA mixologist simply knows how to mix drinks,\u201d he said. \u201cA bartender knows how to run a bar: interact with guests, have fun, have conversations with them. Bill is a bartender. \u201d Mr. Murray looked fatigued toward the end of his shift. When asked what he had learned on the job, he said, \u201cWell, if your barback isn\u2019t getting you the right glasses\u201d  \u2014   he glared at a fellow bartender  \u2014   \u201cthen you\u2019re put in an instant of creativity, where you have to make a drink with the glasses you have. And that, to me, is a life of service. \u201d 1   ounces Slovenia Vodka   ounce Amaro liqueur   ounce fresh lemon juice 2 ounce soda water 1 pinch dried rosebuds Pour the vodka, Amaro and lemon juice into a shaker with ice. Shake vigorously, and strain into a highball glass. Top with ice, soda water and garnish with dried rosebuds. Serve with a straw.'"}, "time": 1742564460.2383308}
