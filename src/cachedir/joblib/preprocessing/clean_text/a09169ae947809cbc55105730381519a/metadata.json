The Washington Post reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says Congress will not seek to ratify the trade deal during the lame-duck session, essentially the last hope of the Obama Administration to pass the deal.

One answer is people-power built around widespread anger over the damage that earlier trade deals, such as NAFTA, have done to America\u2019s manufacturing base and the decent-paying jobs that went with it. \\nThe TPP deal was viewed as one more corporate give-away and another sell-out of the working class, a disdain shared by many on both the Left and Right. That, in turn, inspired a strong bipartisan, grassroots opposition that delayed passage of the deal, carrying the issue into 2016 and the presidential election. Timing sealed the deal\u2019s fate, TPP became political anathema to any politician who tried to touch it. \\nThe pushback against the Trans-Pacific Partnership came from many directions, mainly because of the intersectional nature of the deal itself. The TPP would have affected everything from environmental regulations to internet privacy to pharmaceutical prices to workers\u2019 ability to organize themselves. \\nCelebrating a Victory \\nAt a rally organized by the labor union National Nurses United (NNU) on Nov. 17 in Washington, D.C., various unions, progressive groups and Congressional Democrats came together to celebrate TPP\u2019s apparent defeat and to emphasize the importance of continuing the grassroots momentum under the incoming Trump administration. \\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and former Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner spoke at the event, along with leaders of various unions and organizations, such as AFL-CIO Vice President Tefere Gebre. The Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), the Communication Workers of America (CWA), and United Steelworkers (USW) were some of the unions in attendance to support the defeat of the deal and to celebrate their role in helping halt the deal in Congress. \\nFernando Losada, the Collective Bargaining Director of National Nurses United who organized the rally, said \u201cThe movement against TPP was a movement of movements, if you will \u2014 a movement for healthcare justice, movement for environmental justice, movement for workers rights, etc. All these things were under threat under TPP and now those same movements are under threat [from the Trump administration], so we have to be vigilant, not only about the trade agreements but all the issues.\u201d Members of National Nurses United, which organized the anti-TPP event on November 17, 2016, hold signs supporting Bernie Sanders and Medicare for All.

Because of Trump\u2019s victory in the Nov. 8 election, the rally shifted emphasis somewhat to concerns about the actions of a Trump administration. \\nFor instance, a main theme of the rally was Medicare for All, single-payer healthcare for all American citizens, but there was also fear that the Republican-controlled Congress would take aim at Medicare itself, the health insurance program for the elderly. \\nLosada explained: \u201cMedicare itself \u2014 Medicare for the limited numbers that it\u2019s available to now \u2014 is completely vulnerable and exposed to existential attack by the Republican administration. Paul Ryan, in particular, stated he wants to privatize it.\u201d \\nNext Steps for Progressives \\nThere were also signs of a shared Left-Right hostility toward policies pushed by the Establishment that harm common citizens, the TPP trade deal being only one, though the rally focused on what progressives should do in the future. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about all the political Establishment that would think about undermining our past achievements, our rights, and our aspirations for the future as a movement,\u201d Losado said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to organize people\u2019s power here, there\u2019s just no alternative to it. We can only organize our way out of this one. \\n\u201cWe think that this coming period is going to really rally people, we\u2019re already seeing that. We\u2019re going to see a rise in militancy, a rise in vigilance and maybe this is what the movement needs to finally get us over the hump. The alternative, of a neoliberal regime in power, ultimately may have not helped the final outcome, so we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll remain hopeful. All we can do is fight.\u201d \\nFormer Ohio Sen. Turner, a Bernie Sanders supporter during Campaign 2016, MC\u2019d the event and asked attendees \u2014 particularly progressives \u2014 to be wary against tactics of division and hate in their organizing efforts, tactics which were used extensively by the Trump team. She said the \u201cpromise lies in the problem\u201d and referenced the popular Democratic slogan, \u201cLove Trumps Hate.\u201d \\nBernie Sanders called on Democrats to reflect on their own shortcomings and to formulate a new direction moving forward. He endorsed Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota, to become the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee. (Photo by Chelsea Gilmour) \\nAddressing the likely policies of the incoming Trump administration, Sanders said, \u201cDonald Trump is not going to stand up to the Establishment \u2014 We are going to stand up to the Establishment.\u201d \\nHe stressed the need for individuals of all political stripes to get involved in movement-building in their own communities: \u201cIf there\u2019s any message I have today it is not \u2018Bernie,\u2019 it is \u2018All of Us Together.\u2019 \u2026 \\n\u201cAs previous speakers have told you and what I believe: if you look at history, the lesson that you learn is that when ordinary people stand up by the millions, when they don\u2019t let demagogues divide us up \u2026 when we stand together and keep our eyes on the prize, when we focus on economic justice, when we focus on social justice, racial justice, environmental justice, when we stand together, Donald Trump and nobody \u2014 nobody \u2014 is going to stop us. Let us go forward together.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562196.2105765}
