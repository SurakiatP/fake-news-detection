S. without \u201cextreme vetting\u201d and banning refugees from these countries for at least 30 days.  CAIR has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted   in a   operation. The Council on   Relations is also increasingly a part of America\u2019s institutional left infrastructure and was one of the partners behind the recent Women\u2019s March in Washington that drew hundreds of thousands, along with feminist groups like Planned Parenthood.
