[\u201cObamacare has been broken, and it\u2019s been a broken promise,\u201d Trump said to the press, pointing to the \u201clies\u201d by Democrats that Americans could keep their doctor and their plan and would experience lower premiums. He cited the Obamacare\u2019s leading to skyrocketing premiums in multiple states, many over 100 percent increases.  Trump did not go into detail about what the Senate Republican bill would include, but he said it would be \u201cphenomenal\u201d and \u201cgenerous, kind, with heart. \u201d The Democrats, Trump said, were \u201cobstructionists,\u201d whom he said would never support Republican efforts to fix health care. \u201cEven their new motto  \u2014   \u2018Resist\u2019  \u2014   I guess it\u2019s a pretty accurate motto. Every time I see it, I say, \u2018That\u2019s right. That does represent the Democrats,\u2019\u201d he said. The president said he had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for the Senate Republicans who attended the lunch: Senator Rob Portman ( )Senator John Thune ( )Senator Pat Toomey ( )Senator Mike Lee ( )Senator Ted Cruz ( )Senator Lamar Alexander ( )Senator John Barrasso ( )Senator Cory Gardner ( )Senator Tom Cotton ( )Senator Lisa Murkowski ( )Senator Susan Collins ( )Senator Joni Ernst ( )Senator Orrin Hatch ( ) \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know and love some of them and know and like others,\u201d he said as the senators laughed. When asked about the timing of the Republican Senate healthcare bill, Trump replied, \u201cAs soon as we can do it. \u201d The president is expected to meet with families experiencing the failed promises of Obamacare during a trip to Wisconsin Tuesday.'"}, "time": 1742562198.1032112}
