However, the property dispute was later resolved when Mr. Kejriwal decided to leave the place and protest at Red Fort. \\nMaharaja Jai Singh II, who built Jantar Mantar in 1724, had reincarnated in 1967, and has been keeping an eye on his property for the past few decades from a tea stall across the road. \\nHe was delighted to see tourists from all over the world coming in to admire the structure he constructed, and his self-esteem had hit an all time high when he learned from the tea stall owner that his Jantar Mantar is one of the most popular tourist attractions in India. \\nHowever, for the past few years, he started to become a bit wary of a muffler-clad gentleman sneaking into the premise on a regular basis with a group of people. Initially he gave him the benefit of the doubt assuming they were just a group of theater artists hired by the administrators to entertain the tourists, but soon he realized that the man was popping up almost every day. \\n\u201cDamn, even I didn\u2019t come here that often when I was the king,\u201d grumbled Mr. Singh. \\nAnd on Saturday when Mr. Kejriwal sauntered to Jantar Mantar again after breakfast, he said, \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d and decided to confront him. \\nHe patiently waited at the gate and when Mr. Kejriwal was leaving the ground after dharna , he stopped him and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d \\nMr. Kejriwal was dumbfounded by the question. He was not expecting anyone to question his rights to enter the place he belongs to, and he mumbled,\u201dUmm, protesting.\u201d \\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \\n\u201cWe\u2026ahem,\u201d he cleared his throat and said, \u201cWe are protesting.\u201d \\n\u201cFine, but why here?\u201d \\n\u201cThis is the place where we come to when we have to protest. This is where magic happens.\u201d \\n\u201cGo and protest elsewhere.\u201d \\n\u201cWhere else can we go?\u201d \\n\u201cProtest in your house, your office, or go to JNU, but stay away from my property.\u201d \\n\u201cYour property? Does this place have an owner?\u201d \\n\u201cYes, I own this place.\u201d \\n\u201cHello, this is our official protest venue and we will protest here.\u201d \\nMr. Singh lost his cool. He grabbed him by the collar and pushed him to the ground. \\n\u201cOh, I get it, a Modi agent!\u201d said Kejriwal, a hint of rabid glee on his face. \u201cGo and tell your boss that Kejriwal is not scared of anyone,\u201d he hollered. \\nThe news spread like wildfire and AAP supporters started tweeting about how Modi is not letting Kejriwal work. A few articles were hurriedly published about the emergency like situation created by Modi. \\nMeanwhile, a couple of policemen heard the commotion at the ground and rushed to the scene, screaming, \u201cInk attack, ink attack.\u201d \\n\u201cNo, but it\u2019s an attack on democracy. He is not letting me protest here,\u201d Kejriwal pointed to Jai Singh. \\n\u201cBut why cannot he protest? He lives here,\u201d one of the policemen asked Maharaja Jai Singh and then turned to Kejriwal and inquired, \u201cYou own this place, right?\u201d \\n\u201cUmm, no.\u201d \\n\u201cThen?\u201d \\n\u201cNo, I mean, there are open spaces, ideal for protests and no one stops us so\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cThen you cannot use this place,\u201d asserted the police inspector. \\n\u201cIf Delhi police were under the control of AAP, I would\u2019ve suspended you and this guy would\u2019ve been behind the bars.\u201d \\n\u201cYou mean he would\u2019ve been giving company to your MLAs?\u201d they giggled. \\nKejriwal glared daggers at the policemen. \u201cFine, I am leaving. I will go to Red Fort.\u201d \\n\u201cWhy do you need to protest at historical places?\u201d \\n\u201cBecause I will create history!\u201d he avowed and left for Red Fort. \\nHe was later seen at Red Fort practicing Independence Day Speech from the ramparts.'"}, "time": 1742628501.6948662}
