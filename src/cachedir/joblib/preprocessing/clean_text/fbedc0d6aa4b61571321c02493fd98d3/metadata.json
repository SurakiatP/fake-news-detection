Trump to try to determine who has the strength, preparation and presence of mind to lead during a time of crisis. It sure wasn\u2019t Matt Lauer. In an event aboard the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid, the \u201cToday\u201d host was lost at sea. Seemingly unprepared on military and foreign policy specifics, he performed like a soldier sent on a mission without ammunition, beginning with a disorganized offensive, ending in a humiliating retreat. Mr. Lauer interviewed the candidates in turn for a   each. He began by asking Mrs. Clinton to defend her use of a private email server as secretary of state. And asking again. And again. Roughly a third of his questioning dealt with the emails  \u2014   a matter certainly connected to national security, but also a staple issue of this year\u2019s   reporting. It suggested, as the rest of the forum confirmed, that Mr. Lauer was steadiest handling issues familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the morning politics headlines. That emphasis left relatively little time for the forum\u2019s   and military subjects. Mr. Lauer and the audience asked about complex topics  \u2014   the Middle East, terrorism, veterans\u2019 affairs  \u2014   and Mr. Lauer pressed for simple answers. \u201cAs briefly as you can,\u201d he injected when an audience member asked how Mrs. Clinton would decide whether to deploy troops against the Islamic State. There\u2019s a difference between an interviewer who has questions and one who has knowledge, and Mr. Lauer illustrated it. He seemed to be plowing through a checklist, not listening in the moment in a way that led to productive  . Short on time, he repeatedly interrupted Mrs. Clinton in a way he didn\u2019t with Mr. Trump. (\u201cLet me finish,\u201d she protested at one point.) Candidates should expect to be challenged. They\u2019re applying for a challenging job. But where Mr. Lauer treated Mrs. Clinton like someone running for president, he treated Mr. Trump like someone running to figure out how to be president, eventually. That interview was the apotheosis of this presidential campaign\u2019s forced marriage of entertainment and news. The host of NBC\u2019s morning show interviewed the former star of its reality show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and the whole thing played out as farce. Like Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump has had a few controversies related to the military. You might recall him feuding with a Gold Star family, or mocking Senator John McCain of Arizona for being captured in Vietnam, or likening his   attendance to military experience. Mr. Lauer evidently didn\u2019t recall any of that. He kicked off by asking Mr. Trump what in his life had prepared him to be president, the kind of whiffle ball   question you ask the boss\u2019s nephew you know you have to hire anyway. Mr. Lauer did press the Republican candidate on his claims of a \u201csecret plan\u201d to defeat the Islamic State and his repeated praise of Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia, leading Mr. Trump to cite the Russian authoritarian\u2019s poll numbers and compare him favorably with President Obama. In general, though, Mr. Lauer\u2019s questioning of Mr. Trump was like watching one student quiz another to prep for a test neither had done the reading for. The host asked soft   questions that invited the candidate to answer with word clouds. Mr. Lauer prefaced one question by saying that \u201cnobody would expect you\u201d to have read deeply into foreign policy before running for president. He asked Mr. Trump if he would be \u201cprepared on Day 1,\u201d a    question that will elicit only one answer from any candidate not about to drop out. Most egregiously, Mr. Lauer allowed Mr. Trump to repeat, unchallenged, the false claim that he had opposed the war in Iraq when, as reported by BuzzFeed, he supported the invasion on record in 2002. Any minimally prepared interviewer would have been ready for that claim, even if Mrs. Clinton had not earlier rebutted it in front of Mr. Lauer\u2019s face. NBC News has a vast staff of anchors and reporters. Why turn over the grilling to a guy who had a hard enough time questioning Ryan Lochte? Giving a showcase to your top morning host works only if you\u2019re showcasing something the host does well. Maybe the thinking was that Mr. Lauer would have sufficient training wheels in a format that wasn\u2019t a debate. In fact, he asked each candidate not to attack the other in answers, an absurd request that neither one followed anyway. (Though again, Mr. Lauer criticized only Mrs. Clinton for it.) But the forum was a sort of introductory skirmish before the debates. It gave the candidates a chance to practice, to scout each other  \u2014   and above all, to test the current news media waters, to see how willing a network anchor is to challenge and correct. Mr. Lauer, fortunately, is not going to moderate a presidential debate. But Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace is, and he recently said that he did not consider it his job to   candidates as a moderator. Let\u2019s not mistake who this helps most: the   website PolitiFact has found far more false statements from Mr. Trump than from Mrs. Clinton. Why would a journalist be allergic to verifying the truth? On an MSNBC panel, Chris Matthews guessed that Mr. Lauer didn\u2019t correct Mr. Trump on Iraq because of perceptions. \u201cYou have to call the guy a liar when you do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficult thing for a Matt Lauer to do, because it sounds like an opinion. \u201d But it\u2019s not. When a candidate says he didn\u2019t say something that he did, that\u2019s a matter of fact. Here\u2019s what an opinion looks like: It\u2019s a travesty to be steamrollered by a candidate because you\u2019re worried that doing your job will look bad. To put it in military terms, weakness is an invitation to attack. Going into the debates, what we saw at NBC\u2019s forum should make you very, very worried about our first line of defense.'"}, "time": 1742628583.926843}
