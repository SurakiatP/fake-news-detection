Andrew Cuomo has hired two fundraisers from Florida, a sign he may be working toward a presidential bid, the New York Post reported. [One of the consultants he hired is former Hillary Clinton fundraiser Jon Adrabi, who \u201cwill help plan events and build relationships with Democratic donors in the key swing state. \u201d  \u201cHiring    fundraising staff, particularly in a battleground state, opens up money spigots beyond what would normally be available and is a key first step to laying the groundwork for a run,\u201d a Democratic operative told the Post. The source says that Cuomo wants to \u201chire political consultants with experience outside of New York. \u201d Cuomo is planning several fundraisers next month to add to the $22 million he already has. One of those events includes \u201ca dinner at the St. Regis where tickets cost $15, 000 per person,\u201d and \u201csources say a South Florida event is also in the works. \u201d Cuomo has become very vocal about issues in the Trump administration, further \u201cexpanding his national profile. \u201d He announced a plan to fight antisemitism and hate crimes, spoke out against Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, and vowed to protect transgender students in New York after the Trump administration repealed guidelines allowing students to use the bathroom of their preferred gender identity.'"}, "time": 1742628324.7683084}
