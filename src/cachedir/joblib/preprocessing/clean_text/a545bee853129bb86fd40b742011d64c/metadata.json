The protean actress and playwright has spent her career interviewing and then embodying people of different races and divergent points of view  \u2014   \u201cchasing that which is not me,\u201d as she put it in a recent interview. But her new play, \u201cNotes From the Field,\u201d a prolonged meditation on education and criminal justice, is different. \u201cThis piece,\u201d she said, \u201cis about me. \u201d That may not be obvious to the audience. Like her previous work, including her most famous   plays, \u201cFires in the Mirror,\u201d about the 1991 race riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and \u201cTwilight: Los Angeles, 1992,\u201d about the Rodney King riots, \u201cNotes From the Field\u201d is based on scores of interviews. Ms. Smith plays 19 characters, including Linda Wayman, the dedicated principal of a struggling high school in Philadelphia Kevin Moore, the deli worker in Baltimore who videotaped police officers dragging Freddie Gray into a police transport van and Niya Kenny, the high school student in Columbia, S. C. who videotaped a sheriff\u2019s deputy slamming a    girl on the floor in an effort to extract her from her desk. As in her other plays, these people are represented in their own words, with Ms. Smith reproducing their intonation and cadence. But the themes in \u201cNotes From the Field\u201d are unusually personal, she said in an interview in Cambridge, Mass. in late August. Her mother was a teacher and then a principal in the Baltimore public school system many aunts and family friends were also teachers. All these women believed strongly in the power of education to lift children out of poverty. But her interviews revealed a system that no longer seemed able to do that in most cases. Instead, many children came to school angry, hurt or simply without the requisite   and quickly got into trouble. Some of the most disturbing stories she heard about harsh discipline early on were about the Baltimore schools. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve been gone from there all these years, and this is not the Baltimore that I knew,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Man, it is time to go home. \u2019\u201d She was sitting in a rehearsal room after a matinee at the American Repertory Theater, where she performed the play before its current run at Second Stage Theater, where it is in previews and opens on Nov. 2. Having just spent two hours onstage, she appeared tired, but still paused twice, amid answering questions about the play, to ask a reporter what she thought of certain issues in education. She was wearing soft white pants, a white   and neon rubber   sandals. She sipped tea out of a Harvard mug. Even at lower than usual volume, her voice was captivating  \u2014   deep and slightly husky  \u2014   and when she laughed, it was a hearty cackle. She explained the long and somewhat complicated genesis of the play. \u201cNotes From the Field\u201d began as an investigation of the   \u201c   pipeline\u201d  \u2014   a phrase that refers to the tendency of punitive discipline and police presence in schools to draw young minority students into the criminal justice system. But as she did her research, Ms. Smith said, and spoke to educators, social scientists and others about the role of trauma in children\u2019s lives, she became less enamored of the phrase \u201c   pipeline,\u201d which she believes \u201cblames schools and teachers for something that\u2019s so much bigger. \u201d Four educators are portrayed in the play. Tony Eady\u2019s job title at North Charleston High School is \u201cStudent Concerns Specialist,\u201d which he, by way of Ms. Smith, says means that he is \u201cthe eyes and ears\u201d for the principal. He had been employed in a   prison before coming back to work at the high school, which he also attended. \u201cI often tell some of my colleagues that the penitentiary where I used to work and the school, it is similar,\u201d he says in the play. \u201cThese kids wanna control you. Be able to test you. Manipulate you. \u201d His wife works at another high school, and they talk on the phone every day as they are driving to work, giving each other pep talks. Ms. Smith said he\u2019s important to the play because his viewpoint is likely to challenge her usual audience. \u201cI really wish I had more voices like Mr. Eady,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cSomebody who says: \u2018This is hard. They\u2019re disrespectful. They\u2019re disobedient, and I can\u2019t touch \u2018em and grab \u2018em anymore, and that\u2019s why I need a cop. Because you took that away from me. You took the   discipline away. \u2019\u201d The section of \u201cNotes From the Field\u201d about Baltimore is focused on the death of Mr. Gray and is less clearly about education than the rest of the play, although the bleak prospects faced by young men like Mr. Gray are partly a matter of education, or the lack of it. Besides Mr. Moore, there is Allen Bullock, a protester who describes feeling hatred from the police, and Jamal Bryant, a pastor whose eulogy for Mr. Gray describes the victim as caught in a   crisis, with no doors open to him. Ms. Smith, who had not visited Baltimore in many years, went twice in the spring of 2015  \u2014   first, shortly before Mr. Gray\u2019s death, for her younger brother\u2019s funeral, and then a month later, in the wake of the protests, to conduct research for the play. She was shocked by the physical ruin of parts of the city. Her childhood neighborhood looked \u201cbombed out,\u201d she said. She visited her alma mater, Western High School, and found it very changed, as well. This   school had many Jewish students when she attended, some of whom she befriended through student government. She cannot remember any serious discipline issues. Now, because of white flight, the student body is mostly black, and there are fights and other problems. \u201cThat principal has to be not just a principal  \u2014   she has to be a social worker,\u201d Ms. Smith said. Second Stage has made two changes to the play. A subtitle, \u201cDoing Time in Education,\u201d was dropped because, the artistic director, Carole Rothman, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the piece is only about education. \u201d Also, at the A. R. T. and at Berkeley Repertory Theater, where the play ran in the summer of 2015, there was a   second act in which audience members were organized into groups to talk about the problems it raised. Ms. Rothman said they were not doing that in New York mostly for space reasons  \u2014   the theater\u2019s lobby is small  \u2014   but also because, she said, \u201cNew York is a little different than Harvard in terms of how people deal with their time. \u201d Ms. Smith said she had wrestled with how to get audience members to think more actively about the issues the play brings up. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to learn about, how do you get an audience to change its position from the passive spectator?\u201d she said in Cambridge. \u201cWhat causes an audience to really say, \u2018Well, what can I do about this? \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562310.3319583}
