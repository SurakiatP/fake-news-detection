[The free browser, which automatically blocks  and tracking cookies, has been growing in popularity since its 2015 release and is currently in open beta.  \u201cICOs operate by selling investors cryptocurrency, which can be used to store value in many ways beyond a traditional share,\u201d explained Tech Crunch in their report. \u201cFor its sale, Brave created its own coin  \u2014   The Basic Attention Token, or BAT  \u2014   and sold one billion of them. That collection of BAT cost 156, 250 ETH, which is just over $35 million. \u201d \u201cA further 500 million BAT is stored for user growth and \u2018BAT development,\u2019 according to Brave, which is not planning another token sale in the future,\u201d they continued. \u201cThe ICO is the highest grossing to date, and Brave\u2019s business itself is one of the more interesting to make use the blockchain. \u201d Eich, who created JavaScript but left Mozilla in 2014 in controversial circumstances, had raised $7 million from investors including Founders Fund for Brave. He believes the current internet advertising system is inherently broken, and his ambitious proposal uses the blockchain to make things more efficient for all parties, advertisers, publishers and users, too. \u201d Brave, which was founded by former Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich after he was targeted by social justice warriors over a $1, ooo donation to support Proposition 8, plans to use the proceeds of their ICO to \u201cdevelop its advertising platform. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
