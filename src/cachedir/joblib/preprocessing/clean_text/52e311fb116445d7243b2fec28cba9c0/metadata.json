For a donation of $200, a company would have their logo displayed on the team\u2019s website and jersey for four years. \\nIn early September, Wess Jones, the owner of a boat repair company called 1st Choice Marine and parent to a member of the high school\u2019s bass-fishing team, responded to the offer. Jones\u2019 company logo, a picture of a boat surrounded by red lettering that read \u201cIt\u2019s not about us, it\u2019s all about Jesus,\u201d was rejected by the school.\""}, "time": 1742562197.719442}
