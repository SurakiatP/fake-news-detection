The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself. \\nI myself do not know what precisely to think. Having been at the top of the Washington hierarchy for a quarter century, I have seen many mistaken judgments. At one time I had subpoena power over the CIA and was able to inform President Reagan that the CIA had misled him. He took note and proceeded with his policy of ending the Cold War with the Soviets. On other issues I have been mistaken, because I assumed that there was more integrity in government than actually exists. \\nHowever, FBI director Comey did not need to reopen the case against Hillary simply because some new incriminating emails appeared. Having dismissed the other incriminating evidence, these emails could have passed unremarked. \\nThe problem for the FBI, which once was a trusted American institution, but no longer is, is that there is no longer any doubt that Donald Trump will win the popular vote for president of the United States. His appearances are so heavily attended that thousands are turned away by local fire/occupancy regulations. In contrast, Hillary has curtailed her appearances, because she doesn\\'t draw more than 30 or 40 people. \\nAmericans are sick to death of the corrupt Clintons and the corrupt American media. The Clintons are so completely bought-and-paid-for by the Oligarchy that they were able to outspend Hollywood on their daughter\\'s wedding, dropping $3,000,000 on the event. - Advertisement - \\nNevertheless, I don\\'t underestimate the power of the Oligarchy. As Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury I experienced the Oligarchy\\'s power. If I had not been backed by the President of the United States, I would have been destroyed. \\nIndeed, the Oligarchy is still trying to destroy me. \\nPossibly Trump, as his enemies allege, is just another fake, like Obama who misled the electorate. However, Trump attacks the Oligarchy so strongly that it is hard to believe that Trump isn\\'t real. Trump is asking for a bullet like John F. Kennedy, like Robert Kennedy, like Martin Luther King, like George Wallace. \\nIn Amerika, dissidents are exterminated. \\nTrump is against voting machines over which he has no control. If there are no INDEPENDENT exit polls, Trump can easily be robbed of the election, as the Texas early voting scandal indicates, with the electronic machines assigning Trump votes to Hillary. The \"glitch\" doesn\\'t assign any Hillary votes to Trump. - Advertisement - \\nMy expectation is that, unless Trump\\'s popular vote is so overwhelming, the electoral collage vote will be stolen. Because of the absence of any valid reporting by the presstitutes, I don\\'t know what impact the orchestrated election of Hillary would have on the electorate. Possibly, Americans will break out of The Matrix and take to the streets. \\nI believe that Hillary in the Oval Office would convince the Russians and the Chinese that their national survival requires a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the crazed, insane government of the United States, the complete narcissistic state that in the words of Hillary and Obama is \"the exceptional, indispensable country,\" empowered by History to impose its will on the world. This crazed American agenda is not something that Russia and China will accept. \\nHere is Donald Trump speaking to Americans in words Americans have been waiting to hear. Notice that Trump doesn\\'t need teleprompters. \\nI do not agree with Trump on many issues, but the American people do. For me and for the world, the importance of Trump is the prospect of peace with Russia. Nuclear war makes every other problem irrelevant.'"}, "time": 1742564383.236321}
