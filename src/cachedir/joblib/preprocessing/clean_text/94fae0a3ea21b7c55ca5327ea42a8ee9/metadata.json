Wilbon defended Harper for charging the mound, saying the 2015 National League MVP should have taken his helmet, which he threw in the direction of Strickland, or his bat and tried to hit the Giants pitcher between the eyes. \u201cYou know, Bryce Harper should have taken the helmet and tried to square up and hit the guy who just hit him with a baseball, which is a weapon when thrown 90 miles an hour,\u201d Wilbon told   Tony Kornheiser. \u201cHe should have hit him in the head. \u201d \u201cThe only thing that would have been more just than that if he had taken the baseball bat with him   \u2026     if somebody\u2019s going to throw a baseball at me that could kill me, at 100 miles per hour, I\u2019m not going out there with bare fists, and I\u2019m not going with a helmet. I\u2019m going with a bat. And he\u2019s going to eat some wood,\u201d he continued. Wilbon later added, \u201cHe should have tried to square up and hit him between this eye and this eye. This has to stop. These pitchers doing this, Tony, they\u2019re playing with people\u2019s health and livelihood   \u2026     Harper should have hit him between the eyes with his helmet or bat.
