[During December, more than 800 people \u2014  mostly Christians \u2014  died in   violence in the south of Kaduna state, which forms part of Nigeria\u2019s   middle belt, where the chiefly Muslim north of the country meets the mainly Christian south.  According to Vatican Radio, the Muslim Fulani Cattle herdsmen in the area have recently committed \u201catrocities\u201d resulting in the deaths of \u201cthousands of Christians and the destruction of property worth millions of Naira. \u201d The Nigerian government claims that the death toll is actually lower than the one given by the Catholic church. In a statement, Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama, President of the Bishops\u2019 Conference, said the bishops were \u201cparticularly saddened by the constant and wanton destruction of lives and properties,\u201d noting that   violence had spread around the country and \u201cno one knows which community will be the next victim. \u201d The crisis and violence in Southern Kaduna has destabilized the region and \u201cbrought untold hardship and tensions\u201d on the local Christian population, Kaigama said. Muslim Fulani herdsmen have perpetrated much of the violence against the predominantly Christian local farmers, and some Christians have reportedly also carried out retaliatory killings as well. Government officials have tried to downplay the religious dimension to the conflict, suggesting instead that it is largely about \u201cethnic\u201d rather than religious tensions. \u201cWe live in a country that is     and complex in nature,\u201d Kaigama said. \u201cThat is why we must constantly appeal to the sensibilities of our political leaders not to be seen to promote the interest of any particular group but to be neutral and seek the common things that will promote unity, fairness and equity in the country. \u201d Another local bishop, Joseph Bagobiri of Kafanchan, blamed the government for the systematic elimination of Christians in Southern Kaduna, noting that it will be difficult for Christianity to survive in northern Nigeria. \u201cThe crisis here has persisted because of the way and manner the federal and state governments, as well as the security agents are handling it,\u201d Bagobiri said. \u201cThe root cause of this crisis is the institutionalisation of what could be regarded as structural injustice. \u201d In my view, he said, this is \u201ca deliberate policy of injustice designed to shut our people out from the scheme of things and deny us our rights. \u201d \u201cWe as a Church must evolve new ways on how we can face violence without losing faith,\u201d Bagobiri said. \u201cIt is our prayer that God will give us his strength and the needed direction on how to make Christianity survive despite the constant attacks and persecutions we received. \u201d He added that people have turned to prayer in the absence of government help. \u201cIt is only God that can save us from our present situation,\u201d the bishop said. \u201cOur hope in Him is never in vain since he knows our problem and He will deliver us one day just as he delivered the people of Israel from the hands of the Egyptians,\u201d he said.
