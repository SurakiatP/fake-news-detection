They\u2019ve lost the popular vote five of the last six elections, and if things go the way they\u2019re going and American liberals get out to vote, it\u2019s going to be six of the last seven on the morning of November 9. \\nTrump and the Republican Party would like their followers to believe that this isn\u2019t because their ideology is painfully out of step with the country in modern times. Instead, Trump claims the election will be stolen from him \u2013 whether by \u201cMexicans,\u201d or the media, or a \u201ccabal of international bankers.\u201d \\nBut see, here\u2019s the thing: there is a self-proclaimed billionaire who\u2019s working to undermine the election, and it\u2019s not Carlos Slim \u2014 it\u2019s Donald J. Trump and his paranoid loony bin followers, which include a disturbing number of white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazis, and John Birch dropouts. \\nWhile speaking to a crowd at a rally in Greeley, Colorado late Sunday, Trump once again cast doubts on the mail-in ballots , encouraging people to get another ballot and mail that one in , too. Over and over: \\n\u201cWho has sent their ballots in? And do you think those ballots are properly counted?\u201d Trump asked the audience, to which they replied \u201cNo!\u201d \\nTrump continued by expressing his skepticism and telling supporters to go get new ballots to ensure their vote is counted. \\n\u201c If you go to university center, they\u2019ll give you a new ballot, they\u2019ll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in. \u201d \\nCNN said the comment was \u201cstoking skepticism\u201d because they don\u2019t have the wherewithal to call this what it really is: encouraging voter fraud. \\n\u201cLiberal media\u201d my ass. \\nAnd it appears to be having an effect. Some of Trump\u2019s followers have already taken this message to heart, and at least one has already been arrested for it . \\nBetween these clowns and the clowns that are going to \u201cmake sure there isn\u2019t any illegal voting at the booths\u201d\u2014 i.e, instigate voter intimidation against Hispanics, Arabs, African-Americans and anyone else who doesn\u2019t look like a white Trump supporter \u2014 one gets the feeling that election night is going to be a chaotic one. \\nPhoto by Win McNamee/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562549.887239}
