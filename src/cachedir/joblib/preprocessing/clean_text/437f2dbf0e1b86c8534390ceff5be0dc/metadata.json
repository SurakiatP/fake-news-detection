I\u2019m beating Hillary. \u201d Donald Trump was on the phone with a man he had never met, a Republican delegate in Pennsylvania. It was May 2, one day before the Indiana primary election, and the private plane bearing his last name in gigantic letters was taxiing along a runway at Indianapolis International Airport. Trump proceeded to quote the numbers to the man in Pennsylvania: ahead of Clinton by 2 points in that day\u2019s Rasmussen poll, 3 points behind her in the previous week\u2019s George Washington University poll. These were the only two national polls at the moment that did not show him lagging behind the Democrat by a wide margin in the general election, but Trump was a businessman who preferred to negotiate using numbers that were in his favor. \u201cI\u2019d love your support, Phil,\u201d the candidate said as he squinted at his own handwriting, a scrawl in black marker on a piece of paper. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the only delegate I\u2019ve talked to. But I saw you on television, and you appreciate what I do  \u2014   I won your county by a massive amount, and you\u2019re respectful of that, and I just appreciate what you\u2019ve said: \u2018Having a moral obligation to support the winner\u2019  \u2014   I hadn\u2019t heard a delegate say that before. \u201d Trump thanked the delegate and hung up just as the Boeing 757 took off, en route to a final campaign stop in South Bend. He settled into his plush leather seat, beside a large cardboard box containing various documents relating to the Trump Organization\u2019s sundry enterprises. \u201cIt\u2019s hard negotiating elevator rates while you\u2019re running for president,\u201d he said. On the table before him were some notes for a speech on law and order prepared by his senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, who sat behind the candidate around a table with a few other aides, including Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. On the more conventional presidential campaigns I have covered  \u2014   George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney  \u2014   the candidate\u2019s mobile inner sanctum was a hive of activity, the advisers hovering constantly over their boss, rattling off the latest polling data or words of unsolicited advice from a big donor. On Trump\u2019s plane, the aides spoke when spoken to and otherwise kept to their labors on their laptops. Trump\u2019s attention was on the large   TV on which various Fox News pundits were forecasting his probable victory in Indiana\u2019s Republican primary the following day and the bleak implications for his opponent Ted Cruz. The Republican contest, they all seemed to agree, was pretty much over. The    billionaire now appeared destined to be Clinton\u2019s opponent in the general election. The Fox commentators, even the ones who favored Trump, seemed to struggle for the words to convey this eventuality. The candidate took in the good news with an oddly inert expression. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get beat tomorrow,\u201d he said, for at least the third time that day. Not a single poll had given him cause for worry. But for all his swagger, Trump had an awareness of unseen,   contingencies that held his triumphalism in check. He was compulsively superstitious twice on other plane trips I had seen him toss a few granules of salt over his left shoulder after eating. And here he was, on the day before he would effectively clinch his nomination, calling a single obscure delegate in a state he had already won in a landslide  \u2014   an implicit nod to the forces aligned against him before resuming the affect of indomitability. On the TV, Fox had moved on from the election to footage of the smoky aftermath of a bombing in Baghdad. Trump rose from his seat and walked over to the screen for a closer look. \u201cBoy, this ISIS,\u201d he murmured. I asked Trump if he had ever been to Iraq. \u201cNever!\u201d he said, sounding horrified by the thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s the most dangerous place in the world you\u2019ve been to?\u201d He contemplated this for a second. \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cNo,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously. \u201d It was a stark reminder of what set Trump apart from every other politician in recent memory who had occupied his current position: how little of the world he had seen beyond the archipelago of boardrooms, golf courses and   hotels he inhabited, how utterances that by now would have torpedoed a more normal campaign continued to roll off his tongue with impunity. That Trump would emerge as the last candidate standing from a field that once included 17 seemed at times unimaginable over the five spasmodic weeks I had spent intermittently in the company of the Trump campaign. More than during any other stretch over the past year, everyone  \u2014   at times even Trump and his loyal advisers  \u2014   seemed hellbent on denying him victory. Now it was clear that there would be no technicalities, as some had long suspected, to keep the victory from him no   fatal error, as so many had assumed. No, this was it: the final stage of a process by which Americans accepted that this man, wholly unlike any politician they had ever seen, was going to definitely, not maybe, become the   of one of the two political parties of the most powerful nation on earth. On the TV, the Fox News pundits were speaking consolingly of the     Cruz\u2019s political future. Standing in front of the oversize screen, Trump scoffed: \u201cI don\u2019t think he has much of a future. \u201d He returned to his seat and proceeded to scratch out a few notes for what would be his final speech as a Republican competing for the nomination. \u201cThis is probably the most successful club anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump informed me. \u201cI have the best building and the best location. \u201d It was early on the evening of March 23 at the   bar of    Trump\u2019s private resort in Palm Beach, Fla.: an estate that was envisioned after the death of its original owner, the cereal magnate Marjorie Merriweather Post, as a winter presidential retreat and that could conceivably be, by next January, a   Camp David. Trump strolled in wearing a navy blazer and white dress shirt  \u2014   no tie  \u2014   and appearing slightly tanner than usual. We were supposed to have met late that morning, to begin my several weeks of following the campaign. But his communications director, Hope Hicks, emailed shortly before the scheduled  : \u201cSomething has come up, and the boss is going to be occupied for a few hours. \u201d I deduced  \u2014   correctly, as it turned out  \u2014   that Trump had ditched me for a golf game. It was the first sunny day all week, and the previous evening the candidate had crushed Cruz in Arizona, which occasioned some celebration. Now Trump apologized for having kept me waiting. \u201cAre you going to have dinner with us tonight?\u201d he asked. Trump sat down across the table from me and next to Hicks and Lewandowski, who were poring over their smartphones. Opposite them loomed a painting of a much younger Trump in tennis whites. A waiter materialized and poured him a Coke. (Trump says that he has never touched alcohol.) The month of March had been Trump\u2019s best thus far as a presidential candidate. Although he had, early on, privately rated his chances of winning the Republican nomination as one in 10, he now seemed poised to do just that. On March 1, he clobbered Cruz across the South, winning five of the seven primaries in the region that day  \u2014   victories that wiped out hope, among the many Republicans who viewed Trump as an apocalyptic threat to their party, that Cruz\u2019s support among evangelicals would form a bulwark against the interloper. Two weeks later, Trump decisively won Illinois and North Carolina, and seemed to have squeaked by in Missouri, though the narrow margin there meant that the result wasn\u2019t yet official. More astounding, he won Florida, beating its native son, Senator Marco Rubio, by nearly 19 points and forcing him out of the race. Less than two months earlier, the   senator was the Republican Party\u2019s favorite son: precocious and upbeat but exquisitely calibrated, never in danger of wandering    \u2014   in short, the antithesis of Donald Trump. By early March, Trump had baited him into the tar pit, where he was reduced to questioning the penis size of the man who called him \u201cLiddle Marco. \u201d \u201cHe was branded beautifully,\u201d Trump said, slouching contentedly in his chair. He turned to Lewandowski. \u201cDid they ever announce the results of Missouri?\u201d \u201cSir, they\u2019re still certifying the counts of the delegates,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cAm I leading? Have they taken anything away from me?\u201d \u201cSo far you\u2019ve lost a net of three votes. \u201d \u201cSo when will we know?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re trying to certify this by Friday. They\u2019ve allocated 25 delegates to you, 15 to Cruz  \u2014   there\u2019s still 12 out there. \u201d Trump\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cSo are they saying I won Missouri by doing that?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot yet,\u201d Lewandowski patiently explained. \u201cYou\u2019ve won a series of congressional districts. You won five of them, which is 25 delegates. Cruz won three  \u2014   so 15 for him. \u201d Distaste clouded Trump\u2019s face. Like most Americans, he had until recently been almost completely ignorant of the obscure mechanics by which a candidate became the party nominee. To win the nomination, he needed the support of 1, 237 delegates. Achieving this was not as straightforward as simply winning the most votes in primaries. In each state, lifelong party officials largely controlled the   process. This was the Republican establishment\u2019s last front in its war against Trump  \u2014   and Trump feared, not without cause, that his rivals would resort to whatever connivances were necessary to deny him a 1, 237 majority and throw the Republican convention into a melee of multiple balloting and    . \u201cWhat I don\u2019t like,\u201d Trump said, \u201cis Cruz has a guy working for him\u201d  \u2014   his campaign manager, Jeff Roe  \u2014   \u201cthat\u2019s one of the most powerful guys in Missouri. So when I hear there\u2019s a revote\u201d  \u2014   there wasn\u2019t, actually  \u2014   \u201cI know too much about politics, so I get it. And I don\u2019t like it. \u201d Cruz was, perhaps, the only candidate as   among Republican Party hands as Trump was, but Trump plainly saw the Cruz campaign\u2019s machinations as a reflection of the party establishment\u2019s ferocious determination to stop him. It was no secret that many Republicans viewed Trump as an explosive device poised to obliterate in a single blast the party\u2019s economic orthodoxy and its ability to project an image of tolerance. Trump himself had vowed to blow up the party\u2019s \u201crigged system. \u201d And yet he remained somewhat puzzled as to why the party was so opposed to him. In his view, he had arrived on the scene as something of a gift to the G. O. P. He had attracted to the polls hordes of Americans who had previously given up on the party, or on politics as a whole. Viewers were tuning in to the   Republican debates in   numbers  \u2014   and this, he argued, was \u201c100 percent Donald Trump. \u201d The party had become too obsessed with ideology. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve seen over the years,\u201d he observed, \u201cis that the Democrats stick together, and the Republicans eat their young. That\u2019s why they lose so many elections. You know, a normal, very nice, very likable Republican would be hard pressed to win. \u201d Trump did not accept the concern that his more incendiary statements had alienated women and minorities and thereby made him unelectable. \u201cI\u2019m going to be better to women on women\u2019s issues than Hillary Clinton and everybody else combined,\u201d he would later tell me. Now, sipping his Coke, he cited his     view that Planned Parenthood was a valuable women\u2019s health care organization, albeit one that should not receive federal funding as long as it performed abortions. \u201cFrankly, for the general election I think that\u2019s a very good issue for me,\u201d he said. \u201cStructurally, it\u2019s very hard, almost impossible, for a heavily conservative Republican to win, because of the Electoral College. Whereas I bring in Michigan. Look at what I did in Michigan  \u2014   I won it in a landslide, it wasn\u2019t even close. So I bring in Michigan. I maybe bring in New York. Republicans don\u2019t even go for the general election to campaign in New York, because there\u2019s no chance. \u201d \u201cIllinois!\u201d Hicks chimed in. \u201cI win Illinois,\u201d Trump said of a state in which, by the latest polling from early March, he was trailing Clinton by 25 points and which a Republican had not won since 1988. \u201cThe reason they did an autopsy of the party,\u201d Hicks said, referring to the Republican National Committee\u2019s internal analysis following the defeat of 2012, \u201cwas because the party was dead! People are accusing Mr. Trump of killing the party  \u2014   well, that\u2019s already been done. He\u2019s bringing the party back to life!\u201d Trump said: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m going to do great with the   vote. One poll came out saying Donald Trump\u2019s going to get 25 percent of the   vote. \u201d Trump was referring to last September\u2019s SurveyUSA poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percentage points. (In 1960 against Kennedy, Nixon received 32 percent of the black vote. Since then, the highest share of the black vote any Republican nominee has received was Reagan\u2019s 14 percent in 1980.) \u201cAnd I said, Huh  \u2014   why not more? I\u2019m going to do great with the  . I\u2019m going to bring back jobs. And I\u2019ve had good relations with them. \u201d And, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do far better with Hispanics than anyone thought. I have thousands working for me. When this is over, one of my first pictures is going to be me at the Doral\u201d  \u2014   his golf resort near Miami  \u2014   \u201cwith a thousand of my people working there, most of whom are Hispanic and all who love Trump. \u201d As we moved to the patio for dinner, Trump signaled for Lewandowski and Hicks to join us, which seemed to surprise them. We were seated at a table that afforded a view of the beach while also placing the resort\u2019s owner in the center of everyone else\u2019s attention. Trump accepted the greetings, congratulations and selfie requests with rote magnanimity  \u2014   posing for the camera phones, his forced wince of a smile looked as if someone were grinding a shoe into his toe  \u2014   before dispatching each   with an \u201cEnjoy your evening. \u201d He regarded the parade of men in   or   blazers with a flicker of amusement. \u201cRight out of central casting,\u201d he said. Melania Trump joined us on the patio Trump doted on her throughout the meal, often touching her shoulder or leg and calling her \u201cbaby. \u201d His eldest son, Donald Jr. sat with his wife at a nearby table, as did Trump\u2019s grandchildren and his youngest son,    Barron. Melania\u2019s   and Lewandowski and Hicks\u2019s deferentiality  \u2014   both referred to Trump as \u201csir\u201d and \u201cMr. Trump\u201d  \u2014   lent the whole tableau an Old World texture, like a Habsburg patriarch in repose. \u201cThis is fun, right?\u201d Trump exclaimed. \u201cReally! We\u2019re having a good time!\u201d Sometime after 10, he and his wife rose from the table and said good night. Back in his bedroom just before midnight, he checked his Twitter feed, as he often did when, he told me, he felt the passing urge to \u201cknock the crap out of\u201d somebody. Tonight, one of his eight million Twitter followers had tweeted a pair of photographs: a flattering image of Melania alongside one of Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, with a sort of   expression, with the caption \u201cA picture is worth a thousand words\u201d and the hashtag #NEVERCRUZ. Trump retweeted it from his own account  \u2014   his last public statement of the day. The next morning, a Thursday, Lewandowski drove Hicks and me from    to Trump\u2019s nearby golf resort in one of the candidate\u2019s many cars. \u201cI\u2019m Corey,\u201d Lewandowski, in shorts and loafers, explained to the security guard at the entrance. Then, more emphatically: \u201cWith Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201d The guard eyed him skeptically as we drove past. Though he was Trump\u2019s top aide, Lewandowski was viewed by some political observers in Washington as a glorified body man  \u2014   he seldom left the candidate\u2019s side, and he lacked the   credentials usually characteristic of   campaign strategists. Lewandowski handled the details, not the vision. He was not a guru. Had he been, Trump, who is his own guru, would not have hired him. In his briefcase, Lewandowski carried a bulky black binder. It contained virtually everything of significance in Trump\u2019s political universe: the daily, weekly and monthly master schedules the full staff list with everyone\u2019s contact information a similar list of the campaign\u2019s various contractors daily talking points for staff and surrogates a running tally of the delegate count a list of Trump endorsers a metrics chart of field activities in each state, including the daily number of calls made and doors knocked position papers on each major issue various documents requiring the candidate\u2019s signature and drafts of coming speeches. When he was not taking orders from the candidate, he was on the phone executing them, pacing around with his hand cupped over the receiver like an offensive coordinator furtively calling in plays. What Lewandowski did have in common with David Axelrod, Karl Rove and other marquee strategists was a romanticized view of his candidate  \u2014   one that even Trump, for all his   didn\u2019t seem to share. Lewandowski saw him as a     tilting against a party elite that had not seen fit to embrace either of them. Though Lewandowski had kicked around in the political circles of New Hampshire for much of the past two decades, he had never seen thousands of people turn out to greet a candidate there the way they did his new boss. Nor had he expected the campaigns of more experienced candidates run by   consultants to collapse so quickly and spectacularly in the face of Trump\u2019s challenge. Today, 15 months into the job, Lewandowski plainly admitted that he was not this campaign\u2019s \u201carchitect. \u201d Instead, he described himself to me as \u201ca jockey on American Pharoah. You hold on and give him a little bit of guidance. But you\u2019ve got to let him run. \u201d Over coffee in the club\u2019s sunny dining room overlooking the links, Lewandowski and Hicks joked about the \u201ctoxic infighting\u201d that some media outlets had claimed was bedeviling the campaign. Its four principals  \u2014   Lewandowski, Hicks, the deputy campaign manager, Michael Glassner and the   director, Dan Scavino  \u2014   were, Hicks insisted, extremely close. They had also been made aware of two things by Trump: There was only one star of the campaign, and there was also only one communications director. Unlike most who held her job title, Hicks did not tend to the campaign\u2019s messaging strategy. Nor did Hicks, who is 27, see it as her job to spend evenings sharing    insights over drinks with the traveling press corps. The rest of the Trump team felt similarly. This, combined with the campaign\u2019s unusually long blacklist of media outlets it deemed unfair or unfriendly, had left reporters with few of the usual means of interpreting the campaign\u2019s inner doings, requiring them to rely instead on more   sources. Among those was Trump\u2019s longtime adviser Roger Stone, an inveterate   in the dark seams of American politics who lived by the credo that, as he put it, \u201cthe only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. \u201d Depending on whom you believed, Stone had either been dismissed by Trump last August or had quit. Trump had also parted company with Stone\u2019s former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Sam Nunberg, who worked for Trump from 2011 until last August, when it was disclosed that he had previously posted racist messages about Obama and the Rev. Al Sharpton on his Facebook page. Nunberg no longer spoke to the candidate Stone remained on good terms with Trump but communicated with him infrequently, usually when Trump called to compliment him on a TV appearance. Both harbored an intense dislike for Lewandowski, who they believed had tried to wall off their access to the candidate  \u2014   Stone, whose formative years were spent working for the   campaign of President Richard Nixon, described Lewandowski to me as having \u201call of Bob Haldeman\u2019s negative traits and none of his good ones\u201d  \u2014   and merrily disseminated tales of his imminent professional demise. Outside Trump World, these whispers dovetailed with a sense in the media and the political class that a campaign that began as an odd novelty was evolving into something darker. Trump\u2019s rhetoric had been inflammatory since his announcement speech in June, in which he castigated Mexico for sending \u201crapists\u201d to the United States in December, after a    team of Islamic State sympathizers shot 35 people in San Bernardino, Calif. he issued a statement calling for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on. \u201d Now reports and videos were surfacing of Trump supporters flinging racial slurs and, sometimes, attacking protesters at his rallies. \u201cIf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?\u201d Trump told a crowd in Iowa on Feb. 1. \u201cSeriously. O. K.? Just knock the hell  \u2014   I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. \u201d Then on March 8, Lewandowski grabbed the arm of Michelle Fields, then a reporter for Breitbart News, when she approached Trump at a campaign event at the golf club where we were now sitting, leaving bruises. Fields filed a complaint, and the stories now circulating portrayed a Trump campaign in a state of \u201cserious existential threat,\u201d as one Politico article put it. Stone had been quoted in that article, and Nunberg, who would later announce his support for Cruz, had reached out to Fields through an acquaintance and suggested lawyers to her. Inside Trump World, these matters were regarded as drastically overblown. Trump had no intention of punishing Lewandowski for the Fields incident the way Cruz had thrown his national spokesman Rick Tyler overboard the month before for   Facebook and Twitter posts. Nevertheless, Trump quietly issued the order that his rally venues for the time being be smaller, and thus more easily controlled, even as he stood by his campaign manager and defended his revolution as a nonviolent one. At the golf resort, I brought up the more strategic criticism that had been leveled at the campaign, that Trump needed to turn his guerrilla squad into something resembling a more conventional operation, and asked Lewandowski and Hicks how that might happen. \u201cEver since we won Nevada, all these guys have been calling us and saying we had to build out the team,\u201d Hicks said. The campaign\u2019s core staffers had received this advice with   recognizing it as a worldview at odds with their own  \u2014   and from time to time would draw up imitation organizational charts imagining what an expanded Trump World would look like: But a small cloud was gathering in the otherwise unblemished sky over Palm Beach. That evening, a Wall Street Journal article by Reid J. Epstein was published online under the headline \u201cTed Cruz Gains in Louisiana After Loss There to Donald Trump. \u201d Epstein wrote that although Trump had won that state\u2019s primary, Cruz\u2019s team was exploiting the state party\u2019s arcane rules to help draw many of the delegates their way. The man Trump called \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d was running a campaign operation that, in the view of Trump World, wasn\u2019t half as brilliant as the media had given it credit for. After all, who had won the evangelical vote in South Carolina? Who had swept nearly all of the South? Who had snatched victory in Missouri from the jaws of Cruz\u2019s supposed wizard Roe? Still, Cruz\u2019s campaign had found a different way to win. Trump read the story at    the next day. Unnerved, he called Roger Stone. \u201cCan they really steal this thing from me?\u201d Stone later recalled Trump asking him. Stone told him that yes, such a feat was entirely possible. The last time anyone in the Republican Party had felt the need to prepare for a brokered convention was 1976, when former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California mounted an insurrectionary challenge to President Gerald Ford. Among the operatives managing Ford\u2019s short but intense   fight was Paul Manafort, a    prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ford\u2019s campaign manager, the future secretary of state James Baker. Manafort went on to advise several subsequent Republican presidential campaigns, but since the  \u201980s, much of his counsel had been devoted to helping foreign leaders including Ferdinand Marcos and Vladimir Putin\u2019s ally in Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. Still, with his pinstripe suits and   deftness, he represented a steady and   contrast to Trump\u2019s whippetlike campaign manager. He was also more than 25 years Lewandowski\u2019s senior  \u2014   a true peer to Trump, who often referred to his traveling entourage as \u201cthe kids. \u201d As it happened, he lived on the 43rd floor of Trump Tower, and was Stone\u2019s former business partner. At Trump\u2019s request, Manafort had dinner the evening of March 24 with the candidate at   . Manafort offered his services pro bono  \u2014   he was already plenty wealthy, and presumably preferred an optimized blend of influence and independence. Four days later, on the morning of Monday, March 28, members of the campaign staff assembled at the Washington office of Donald McGahn, Trump\u2019s campaign lawyer, for a secret meeting. The team conferred for three and a half hours. The manager of Trump\u2019s shoestring delegate operation, Ed Brookover, and his deputies Brian Jack and Alan Cobb, began with a review of the campaign\u2019s current   status state by state. But midway through the presentation, the discussion spilled over into a deeper examination of the state of the campaign  \u2014   of how the candidate\u2019s message should be shaped and how his operation should be broadened. As the newcomer in the room, Manafort was deferential but also pointed in his observations. He told Lewandowski he was taking on a new role now, according to two people present at the meeting. He was bigger than just a campaign manager, he said. Senators would want to meet with him directly, and he should leverage that when he was in Washington. Such leveraging was, of course, exactly the skill of an establishment hand like Manafort, not an outsider like Lewandowski. (A spokesman for Manafort said he did not recall this being said.) The next morning, March 29, Lewandowski turned himself in to police in Jupiter, Fla. and was charged with simple battery for the incident with Michelle Fields. Ultimately the state attorney for Palm Beach County would decline to prosecute him. What lingered in significance, however, was the complete senselessness of his denial that he had ever touched Fields. (The episode was captured on video.) Instead, Lewandowski had followed the example of his pugnacious boss, which he and Hicks characterized to me during our meeting at Trump\u2019s golf resort in Palm Beach: Don\u2019t back down. Double down. Trump, meanwhile, had other problems. He was now campaigning in Wisconsin, where   forces were mounting a fierce and skillfully coordinated effort to deny him the nomination at the convention. \u201cI\u2019ve never said this before, but if I don\u2019t win it on the first ballot, the dishonest establishment will never allow me to win,\u201d Trump told me aboard his 757 on the morning of April 5. We were departing Milwaukee, where voters were going to the polls, and the Fox News pundits on his TV were dissecting what had been the worst   stretch of his young political career  \u2014   one that had begun with his campaign manager\u2019s arrest. When one commentator made reference to Trump\u2019s recent \u201cunforced errors,\u201d Trump said, \u201cO. K. you can turn the sound down now. \u201d Scavino obliged. Referring to the results of the Wisconsin primary that would arrive that evening, Trump asked me, \u201cWhat do you think is going to happen?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to lose,\u201d I said. He shrugged. \u201cI have the whole machine against me. \u201d Surveying his recent setbacks, however, he allowed that he had perhaps made some mistakes. He had come to regret his decision to retweet the Heidi Cruz photo that night at    which had dogged him for weeks now. \u201cI could\u2019ve done without it,\u201d he gruffly acknowledged. \u201cSome people were offended. \u201d I asked him if it was strategically wise to have spent the past week in Wisconsin repeatedly attacking the state\u2019s governor, the former presidential candidate Scott Walker  \u2014   who, granted, was a Cruz supporter but who also enjoyed an 80 percent favorability rating among the state\u2019s Republicans. \u201cMaybe not,\u201d Trump mumbled. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. \u201d Then there was his interview the previous week with the MSNBC host Chris Matthews, who asked him whether his   views meant that he also supported criminal penalties for a woman who had an abortion. Trump had replied that yes, there should be \u201csome form of punishment. \u201d Now he argued to me, rather unconvincingly, that he had been misinterpreted: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean punishment for women like prison. I\u2019m saying women punish themselves. I didn\u2019t want people to think in terms of \u2018prison\u2019 punishment. And because of that I walked it back. \u201d A more believable explanation, furnished by a senior adviser for the Trump campaign, is this: Trump, a serial   initially saw nothing wrong with his remark and refused to walk it back. Only when every network chief executive and over 100 media outlets besieged the Trump campaign with requests for additional comment on how women should be punished for abortions did the Trump campaign turn to an ally: Chris Christie, whose tenure as the Republican governor of the blue state of New Jersey had given him experience placating both social conservatives and the moderate voters Trump hoped to attract in the general election. A member of Christie\u2019s political team helped draft a statement that essentially repudiated Trump\u2019s earlier one. In any other presidential campaign, this string of failures would have cost someone his or her job. But no heads had rolled in Trump World  \u2014   a tacit acknowledgment by the candidate, perhaps, that responsibility for the campaign resided in the man with the office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower. The campaign\u2019s inner circle remained intact Hicks now sat directly behind Trump on the plane, pecking away at her laptop alongside Lewandowski, whose eyes were haunted with fatigue and who had lost so much weight recently (15 pounds, he would later tell me) that his blue blazer drooped like a cloak around his shoulders. I asked Trump if his campaign manager\u2019s job description had been affected by recent developments. \u201cZero,\u201d he insisted. That evening Trump lost Wisconsin by 13 points to Cruz. Further setbacks followed in Colorado and Wyoming, where Cruz\u2019s team outmaneuvered Trump\u2019s in the   process, as even some of Trump\u2019s staff members would concede to me. Lewandowski thought highly of the 1993 Bill Clinton campaign documentary \u201cThe War Room,\u201d and admiringly regarded Clinton\u2019s team as a roomful of \u201ckillers. \u201d The able but   Trump delegate crew, which included Jack, Brookover and Barry Bennett  \u2014   all alumni of Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s recently shuttered campaign  \u2014   did not seem to have the appetite for the jugular that Cruz\u2019s team did. At 8 in the morning on Saturday, April 16, Trump\u2019s top staff members convened on the fifth floor of Trump Tower. Ten months into the race, the candidate\u2019s headquarters looked more like the dingy redoubt of a     mayoral campaign than the hypercaffeinated situation room of a presidential  . On ordinary days, no more than eight or 10 staffers inhabited the warehouselike floor, which in the manner of many campaigns was decorated like a   dorm suite: a model White House topped with pink flamingos,   posters of John Wayne and Ronald Reagan, an oversize plush lion the team had named Lion Ted. A recent description in New York Magazine of its spartan condition offended the building owner, who protested to me, \u201cIt\u2019s this beautiful raw space!\u201d He conceded that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign offices in Brooklyn might be better appointed  \u2014   \u201cthough she never had my location. \u201d Manafort and Lewandowski had gathered the team to discuss the campaign\u2019s new structure  \u2014   which would now have Manafort overseeing the entire delegate operation and Lewandowski the campaign apparatus  \u2014   and to introduce its new members, including Rick Wiley, the national political director, previously Scott Walker\u2019s campaign manager. The candidate strolled into the conference room. \u201cWow, this looks like a professional group of people,\u201d he said, smiling, according to two sources who were present. \u201cAll right, guys. I need you to go win. And we\u2019re going to make sure you have what you need to win. \u201d After speaking for less than two minutes, Trump walked out. For the rest of the meeting, much was said by everyone in the room, but nothing was decided, because Manafort and Lewandowski had thoroughly opposing visions of how the campaign should be run. The   strategist believed it was time for Trump to close out the primaries by taking a more scripted, mollifying approach. The campaign manager held to the view that people attended a Trump rally fully expecting the same type of raucous, unpredictable drama they saw at a sporting event. Trump apparently was listening to both men now. But it was not obvious that morning whose view would prevail  \u2014   or even which of the two had the authority to give orders. One attendee told me that he came out with no more clarity than he had before the meeting. When Politico broke the news of the secret meeting two days later, on the evening of April 18, Trump was en route to a campaign rally in Buffalo aboard his smaller Citation X airplane, with Hicks, Lewandowski and Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, who was informally advising the campaign. It was the day before the New York primary, and Trump sat in the front of the   plane. \u201cI have to think about my speech now,\u201d he told me, and began composing one on the spot. He leafed through various talking points and issue memos, from which he culled a few ideas that he then scribbled on another piece of paper. Once he was done with the other documents, he tore them in half lengthwise and let the scraps flutter to the floor. The plane touched down at the airport, and the waiting fleet of black sedans whisked the candidate and his entourage to the city\u2019s hockey arena, where the rally would take place. Trump was posing for photographs with campaign volunteers when Hicks\u2019s phone buzzed. It was Paul Manafort, calling to try to head off another   controversy. A woman whom Trump had briefly considered hiring in 2015 to help with communications strategy, Cheri Jacobus, was suing the candidate, his campaign and Lewandowski for libel after Trump tweeted that she had \u201cbegged my people for a job,\u201d in addition to a few other disparaging remarks. Trump wanted to punch back  \u2014   it was what he did and in Lewandowski\u2019s view, the candidate\u2019s brawling, politically incorrect impulses were what had made him the   to begin with. At the candidate\u2019s direction, Hicks had prepared a statement chiding Jacobus\u2019s threat. Manafort was now on the phone urging Trump not to release the statement. Attacking Jacobus yet again struck him as unnecessary, not to mention a distraction from the task at hand: winning big in tomorrow\u2019s primary. It also flew in the face of Manafort\u2019s publicly stated vow that his new client would now be evincing a more \u201cpresidential\u201d affect. Trump grew more   as he heard Manafort out. Then he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me how to [expletive] do P. R. \u201d He stepped into a private room to fix his hair, then posed for a few more photos with the man who was about to introduce him to the crowd, Rex Ryan, head coach of the Buffalo Bills. That evening, addressing a hockey arena filled with perhaps 17, 000 delirious Trumpophiles, he bellowed: \u201cI don\u2019t want to really act more \u2018presidential\u2019 until we win!\u201d The following evening at Trump Tower, the man who stepped out before the press  \u2014   heralded by Sinatra\u2019s \u201cNew York, New York\u201d  \u2014   to celebrate his   victory in his home state\u2019s primary appeared uncharacteristically subdued. He referred to his vanquished opponent not as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d but as \u201cSenator Cruz. \u201d He held his usual grievances in check. After eight minutes, he departed the lectern without taking any questions. Manafort had managed to impose a veneer of Beltway respectability on the campaign. More field organizers were now materializing in states like Pennsylvania, where local volunteers had hitherto been left largely to fend for themselves. Supporters who previously received no direction from the campaign before going on TV to expound on the candidate\u2019s policies  \u2014   \u201cI just make [expletive] up,\u201d Representative Duncan Hunter of California confessed to a Trump senior adviser  \u2014   were now receiving daily talking points. But the       \u2014   where to go, whom to see, what to say and how to say it  \u2014   still rested almost exclusively upon the whims of Trump and, secondarily, with the person in his immediate proximity, who was almost always Lewandowski. That became apparent to me on the morning of April 25, the day before the string of Northeastern primaries that would restore Trump\u2019s indomitability. The candidate was seated in the front of his Citation as it departed the airstrip of Warwick, R. I.  \u2014   a stop that, Manafort and Lewandowski agreed, had been a complete waste of the candidate\u2019s time, given that he was ahead of Cruz there by 40 points. But when Trump told Lewandowski, \u201cI can\u2019t just not go there,\u201d there was little point arguing. Lewandowski began making calls to his advance team on Sunday morning. Some 24 hours later, Trump walked into a sweaty and delirious tented gathering adjacent to a Warwick hotel  \u2014   exulting, with customary hyperbole: \u201cWe set this up 12 hours ago! There\u2019s thousands outside  \u2014   we need a bigger tent!\u201d Later that day, en route to West Chester, Pa. Trump\u2019s thoughts kept wandering afield from politics. He sat with a large stack of newspaper clippings  \u2014   some of them with handwritten notes from his daughter Ivanka  \u2014   at his feet. To his right sat his    son Eric, whom I heard Trump refer to as \u201choney. \u201d He perused some documents relating to a land deal he was considering, pausing to fret over the fate of his friend Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback whose   suspension for his role in the Deflategate scandal was upheld that morning by a federal appeals court: \u201cHe should\u2019ve sued the N. F. L. in Boston at the very beginning. \u201d He asked Lewandowski whether his campaign schedule would allow him to attend the June 25 grand opening of his Turnberry golf resort on the coast of Scotland. \u201cIf we get to 1, 237, you\u2019re there,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cIf we\u2019re at 1, 100, you\u2019re going nowhere. \u201d Trump scowled a bit but did not protest. I was reminded that Trump was still fundamentally a real estate developer with exactly zero previous campaign experience, who had gotten this far by spending only a fraction of what his opponents had and against the wishes of his party  \u2014   who was as new to the idea of a Trump candidacy as the rest of us were. Although his political maturation over the past year had not been altogether linear, it seemed clear that an understanding of what his candidacy meant to his supporters was taking root. Trump seemed aware, despite his insistence that voters of all stripes were drawn to him, that his constituency came chiefly from white   Americans who felt left out of the Obama recovery and cheated by what they saw as a rigged economic system. Playing to this sentiment, he had begun to include in his speeches a litany of dire economic statistics pertaining to whichever state he happened to be visiting at the time. The data, compiled by Sam Clovis and Stephen Miller, senior policy advisers, invariably cited the collapse of that local manufacturing sector over the past two decades. It had become axiomatic in Trump World that wherever jobs had been lost was also where Trump\u2019s voters could be found. \u201cThey\u2019re great people,\u201d he murmured back on the plane after the event in Buffalo. \u201cAnd they want help. \u201d His face crinkled in disgust. \u201cThey don\u2019t want hope. They want help. \u201d It was a sobering reminder of the expectations that a President Trump might find on his shoulders come January. But the moment passed, and his mood seemed to regain altitude, the desperate souls on the rope line reaggregating into an adoring mass of     yugeness. \u201cSo you\u2019ve covered other people  \u2014   nobody comes close to this,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo guys from Fox said they\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \u201d We rose upward through the skies in the vehicle Trump referred to as \u201cjust about the fastest plane made,\u201d eventually passing over the Ferry Point golf course that Trump said he had built faster than anyone else could, and finally toward the great Manhattan skyline that Trump had made even greater  \u2014   a taste of what he could do for America, if its great people would only let him.'"}, "time": 1742561643.7186143}
