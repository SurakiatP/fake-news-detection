[Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) was left in critical condition, and four others were also wounded when the attacker opened fire during Wednesday\u2019s congressional baseball practice. The gunman carried an \u201cassassination\u201d list in his pocket that contained the names of three GOP house members who were at the baseball practice.  GOP lawmakers responded to the shooting by stressing a renewed focus on national reciprocity, with some pointing out that they have concealed carry licenses but cannot keep guns with them because they have to drive into Washington D. C. which has draconian gun control laws. On Thursday, Rep. Thomas Massie ( ) sought to remedy this situation by introducing legislation that would that would force D. C. to recognize the carry permit of every state. In other words, D. C. would adopt national reciprocity. But on Friday, Kelly pledged to stop any effort to pass legislation that would allow   citizens to be armed in this fashion. Speaking to NPR, Kelly said he and his wife are fighting against \u201cconcealed carry reciprocity. \u201d He also vowed to fight efforts to remove \u201c  zones in schools. \u201d He couched these statements amid a larger discussion of creating a \u201csafer society. \u201d But the problem \u2014  as Wednesday\u2019s attack showed \u2014  is that barring   citizens from having guns with them for   only makes them vulnerable.

Kelly also failed to note that his wife, Gabby Giffords, was shot by a man who passed a background check to acquire his gun.
