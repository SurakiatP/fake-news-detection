Trey Gowdy ( ) said he was troubled that FBI Director James Comey would not confirm there is an investigation into leaks of classified information.  Gowdy said, \u201cI think the most troubling part for me was when Director Comey would not assure us that there\u2019s a leak investigation. He was more than happy to assure us that there\u2019s an investigation into the potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, which may or may not be a crime.
