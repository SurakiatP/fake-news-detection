Putin of Russia even though he is \u201ca killer,\u201d seemed to equate Mr. Putin\u2019s actions with those of the United States. \u201cYou got a lot of killers,\u201d he told the interviewer, Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News. \u201cWhat, you think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d Mr. Trump has long expressed his admiration for the Russian leader\u2019s strength. But his willingness to seemingly draw a moral equivalence to actions by Mr. Putin, who has brutally suppressed dissent by eliminating political enemies, led to an eruption on social media. Many asked how conservatives would have reacted had President Barack Obama, or other Democrats, compared American actions to Mr. Putin\u2019s. The exchange surfaced on Saturday night in an excerpt from the interview, which is to be broadcast on Sunday before the Super Bowl. What Mr. Trump was specifically referring to or whether there was added context that came after his comment was not immediately clear based on the excerpt that was made available. In the interview, Mr. Trump was asked if he respected Mr. Putin. He said he did, adding that he respected \u201ca lot of people, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to get along with him. \u201d Mr. Trump continued: \u201cHe\u2019s a leader of his country. I say it\u2019s better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS  \u2014   which is a major fight  \u2014   and Islamic terrorism all over the world  \u2014   major fight  \u2014   that\u2019s a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea. It\u2019s very possible that I won\u2019t. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to mend ties with Moscow has raised questions over his administration\u2019s commitment to maintaining sanctions against Russia for its involvement in the fighting and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. He said he was willing to work with Kiev and Moscow to resolve a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, after a telephone call on Saturday with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, Reuters reported. The call was the first direct contact between the two leaders since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cWe will work with Ukraine, Russia and all other parties involved to help them restore peace along the border,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a White House statement. His comments contrasted with those of Nikki R. Haley, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, who on Thursday condemned Russia for its \u201caggressive actions\u201d in eastern Ukraine. She said the United States wanted improved relations with Russia, but added that American sanctions imposed after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea would remain in place. She said \u201cthe dire situation\u201d demanded \u201cclear and strong condemnation\u201d of Russia\u2019s actions. In another excerpt from the Fox interview, Mr. Trump was asked whether it was irresponsible for him to say that three million illegal immigrants voted in the election while lacking the evidence to support that assertion. \u201cWhen you see illegals, people that are not citizens and they\u2019re on the registration rolls,\u201d he started to say before shifting. \u201cLook, Bill, we can be babies, but you take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people, you have this  \u2014   it\u2019s really a bad situation, it\u2019s really bad. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564378.8265047}
