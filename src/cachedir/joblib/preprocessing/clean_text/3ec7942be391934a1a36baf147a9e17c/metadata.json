As Vox reports, Aleppo has been one of the \u201cmost significant battlefield\u201d in the country's continuous fight between Bashar al-Assad and government rebels since 2012. \\nBana recently created a Twitter account with her mother, Fatemah, to finally show the world what life is like for those in their war-torn city. \\nIn an interview with Independent Journal Review, Bana said the violence in her country is \u201call she knows.\u201d \\nWhen asked to describe what happens when a bomb goes off, she said: \\n\u201cThe bombing is predictable. It always hits civilian places so there\u2019s always fear \u2014 not just me, but thousands live in fear every day.\u201d I am very afraid I will die tonight. This bombs will kill me now. - Bana #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/KqVHwqRClK \u2014 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) October 2, 2016 \\nUnlike many children, Bana doesn't go to school. She explained that a typical day doesn't even involve playing outside: \\n\u201c[We just] keep strong & [have] hope.\u201d This is what remains of our childhood memories. - Bana #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/O7NjuxnAzP \u2014 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) October 21, 2016 \\nHere she is in what used to be her family's garden, which is now just a pile of rubble: This is our bombed garden. I use to play on it, now nowhere to play. - Bana #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/drWnwflSOE \u2014 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) October 4, 2016 \\nAs you can see, life in Aleppo is a far cry from what many in the United States will ever experience. \\nBana hopes that her message for President Barack Obama will be heard loud and clear. Instead of a plea for her personal safety, her request shows tremendous understanding of the broader picture and concern for all involved: \\n\u201cStop [the] war and bring peace.\u201d \\nPretty profound for a 7-year-old. \\nBana has amassed a Twitter following of more than 77,000 people. When asked about having such a huge platform to share Aleppo\u2019s story, she gave the most humble and selfless response: \\n\u201c[I'm] very happy and good. One day people will help us.\u201d Hello world we are still alive. Wake up this morning alive. - Fatemah #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/EZz7xqbJ6E \u2014 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) October 3, 2016 \\nBana possesses an innate ability to have faith in a situation that should give her every reason to doubt God's existence. \\nThe 7-year-old admitted she believes in God, prays and said her faith has \u201cincreased\u201d in light of her circumstances. \\nBut she doesn't just pray for herself. She also said she prays every day for \u201cpeace around the world.\u201d This is me before the war. Tonight I'm praying for peace #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/vvMV6EtpVl \u2014 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) September 26, 2016 \\nWhen Bana grows up, she wants to be three professions she \u201cloves most\u201d: a teacher, author and actress. \\nShe says her faith will not falter in the face of violence, war and evil. Bana firmly believes better days are coming, but has a lasting message for not just President Obama, but the entire world: \\n\u201cI want us saved.\u201d \""}, "time": 1742562661.8563282}
