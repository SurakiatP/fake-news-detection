County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) in 2010, she was falsely accused of intentionally starving him. He had been diagnosed by a pediatrician with \u201cfailure to thrive,\u201d but the doctor at the time also noted that the child was in no immediate danger, according to Duval\u2019s attorney, Shawn McMillan. \\nNot only did DCFS seize her baby, but they ordered no reunification because they claimed Duval would starve her baby to get attention due to Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) a rare, widely discredited mental disorder often used (and misused) against mothers by social workers across the country. The basis for DCFS\u2019 claim \u2013 that Duval\u2019s baby was underweight and she was taking him to doctors to find out what was wrong with him \u2013 sounds more like what any concerned, responsible mother would do, not some twisted form of child abuse. \\nSee: World Renowned Medical Anthropologist Compares Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Labeling to Witch Hunts \\nIn a stunning blow to Los Angeles County, the jury found that its DCFS social workers \u201cintentionally and willfully\u201d seized her child without a warrant, and did so \u201cwith malice.\u201d Additionally, the jury found that the county DCFS had \u201can official custom and/or practice of seizing children from their parents without a warrant\u201d and failed \u201cto enact an official policy or procedure when it should have done so.\u201d \\nSee: Mom stripped of son wins $3M from social workers \\n\u201cThe law is very clear, and they (social workers) get special training on this. You cannot seize a child from its parents unless there\u2019s an emergency,\u201d stated McMillan in an interview with FOX 11, a local TV station. \\nThe jury awarded Duval $2.94 million in compensatory damages, plus $165,000 after finding in a separate verdict that she was the victim of discrimination, since she suffers from a lifelong tremor disorder, which social workers wrongfully claimed interfered with her ability to feed and care for her child. The money awarded for punitive damages will come directly from the social workers. \\n\u201cMoney is not everything. And no money can satisfy how I feel,\u201d Duval told FOX 11\u2019s reporter as she choked back tears. The win is bittersweet, since she is still pursuing custody of her son.

He has been awarded the \u201cStreet Fighter of the Year\u201d award for defending family rights and taking on the abuses of social service agencies in California. \\n\u201cYou have to have a fire in your belly,\u201d to fight CPS, he said in an interview with Medical Kidnap. \u201cIt\u2019s not considered \u2018sexy\u2019 or high profile.\u201d \\nMcMillan was a highly successful lawyer prior to taking on CPS cases. \u201cI was like a mercenary. I was good at it \u2013 very good.\u201d \\nBut when he took Deanna Fogerty\u2019s case in 2007, his eyes were opened. Deanna had her daughters taken from her wrongfully for six years, and sued Orange County. McMillan fought her case all the way up to the Supreme Court, where Fogerty finally won. \\nNow, he says: \\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust these guys (CPS) farther than I can throw them.\u201d \\n\u201cNo one does this,\u201d McMillan pointed out, noting the lack of lawsuits against CPS agencies nationwide, despite the widespread abuses of power. \\n\u201cI hope other parents, other attorneys will take up the fight with these guys,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking kids is a one billion dollar industry \u2013 do you really think they\u2019ll just stop? These cases will hopefully show others that the government does bleed.\u201d \\nMcMillan acknowledges that Duval\u2019s case has a fairly narrow Constitutional application: specifically defining parents\u2019 4 th amendment (freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures) and 14 th amendment rights (due process). \\n\u201cThis case demonstrated that our community still places a high value on the Constitution. They cannot seize a child from a mother without a warrant.\u201d \\nDuval\u2019s successful case may positively affect several other cases McMillan is pursuing, including class action lawsuits against Orange County and Riverside County in California, both of which are also accused of kidnapping thousands of children without a warrant. \\nSee:'"}, "time": 1742628439.1619136}
