Terry McAuliffe says a bill that would have prohibited his state from entering into contracts with Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers \u201cwould harm tens of thousands of Virginians,\u201d reports ABC7. [As expected, McAuliffe vetoed a bill that would have allowed Virginia to redirect Medicaid funding from abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood to other federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) that are more numerous and provide more comprehensive care.  During a veto event outside the executive mansion Tuesday, McAuliffe said the mansion was the \u201cbrick wall\u201d protecting women\u2019s health care, says a report at Richmond  . \u201cIt\u2019s important for women to have access to quality health care,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThis is what matters to Virginia families today. \u201d \u201dWe are here today because I\u2019m going to veto senate bill 2264.\u201d  \u2014  @TerryMcAuliffe #IStandWithPP pic. twitter.   \u2014     (@PPMW_ACT) February 21, 2017,  In his remarks, McAuliffe also likened North Carolina\u2019s bathroom privacy law to the bill he vetoed as another example of discrimination that could harm Virginia\u2019s business interests. \u201cDiscrimination breeds hatred and we will not tolerate that in the commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe treat everyone equally, with dignity and respect. \u201d Planned Parenthood tweeted its celebration of McAuliffe\u2019s veto of the bill: It\u2019s a great day to have @GovernorVA as a Planned Parenthood supporter. #HB2264 has been vetoed! pic. twitter.   \u2014   PPAVirginia (@PPAVirginia) February 21, 2017,  The legislation was sponsored by Del. Benjamin L. Cline (R) and passed the state Senate last week on a   vote. \u201cThis important legislation would have prioritized taxpayer dollars toward providers of more comprehensive health care services, and the governor\u2019s veto undermines those efforts to improve health care in rural and underserved areas,\u201d Cline said in a statement. Democrat leaders, however, defended Planned Parenthood. \u201cAttacks on Planned Parenthood do nothing to advance health care,\u201d said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D). \u201cThey take us in the wrong direction. \u201d Lt. Gov. Ralph S.  Northam (D) who is making a bid for governor, took the \u201cwar on women\u201d approach by saying lawmakers, \u201cmost of whom are men,\u201d should let women decide what to do with their bodies. Nevertheless, Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, said in vetoing the bill, McAuliffe placed \u201cthe abortion lobby\u201d before \u201cthe women and unborn children of the commonwealth. \u201d A similar bill prohibiting Medicaid funds to any abortion provider passed the Virginia state legislature last year. In a strong show of support for Planned Parenthood, McAuliffe went to the abortion business\u2019s facility in Richmond itself to veto the legislation. The Virginia Bureau of Watchdog. org reported that Planned Parenthood contributed more than $1. 7 million to McAuliffe\u2019s gubernatorial campaign in 2013. Abortion industry lobbying organization NARAL donated $56, 000 to his campaign, as well. Federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) provide many more services to   families than Planned Parenthood does. Nationally, there are 13, 000 FQHCs  \u2014   a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities 20 to 1. Despite the overwhelming number of FQHCs, however, Democrats who are often supported by the abortion lobby claim that by redirecting funding away from Planned Parenthood, states are preventing   individuals from accessing health care.'"}, "time": 1742628457.338199}
