[The 1976 Olympic decathlon gold medal winner voted for Trump and feels more empathy for the GOP political philosophy than he does with the Democrat party, but Jenner considers the president\u2019s decision to allow the states to determine rules for the use of student bathrooms and locker rooms by transgendered students a step backward.   \u201cWhen (Trump) pulled back on the Title IX (guidelines) it kind of killed \u2014  It destroyed me,\u201d said the former world\u2019s most versatile athlete. \u201cThis of all cases is when we need (the government) to step in. The bottom line is bullying in schools is going to be worse, and then there\u2019s already bullying online where there\u2019s no protection, no escape.  \u201cWhen you take away protection in schools, to be honest with you, it is devastating to these kids. These politicians say it is to protect their children in bathrooms. But young people will die. And they are transgender. Suicide rates will go up. What if that\u2019s your kid? The federal government is basically saying, you don\u2019t really exist. \u201cI was outspoken when Trump did that. And I should be. \u201d Jenner still thinks it easier to show a Republican the error of his ways than try to reconstruct a Democrat:  For me, philosophically, I\u2019m on the Republican side. I have conservative views. But I\u2019m also trans.   \u2026     I would much rather convince Republicans to do better with (LGBT) issues than to try to convince Democrats to lower taxes and have less regulations and less government. I work hard, mostly behind the scenes, to change (Republicans\u2019) views. When I sit down with Republican senators, they\u2019ll tell me they\u2019ve never met a trans person before and they\u2019ll mention their faith. I explain how faith has played a big part in what I have done and am doing right now. Just sitting at the table with someone, that can change people\u2019s minds. USA Today reports that Jenner\u2019s memoir includes a quote from Milton Diamond that says, \u201cBiology loves variation. Biology loves differences. Society hates it. \u201d Diamond might not have meant that a male removing his genitalia demonstrates biological variation, but if the shoe fits \u2014  or, if the high heels fit \u2014  wear them.'"}, "time": 1742562703.084743}
