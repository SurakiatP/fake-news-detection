I\\'m not happy with the ultimate choices that we\\'re left with, but I\\'m still going to go out there and vote because I do believe that it\\'s my right. And I think there are other things we have to consider. \\nAnd then there\\'s the congressional power. There\\'s also the seats in Congress. And I think a lot of people who don\\'t show up to vote for the president then forget that there\\'s all these other people we get to vote into Congress. So you\\'re giving up so much just because you don\\'t like the candidate choices.\" \\nShe did reveal the issue that has her most concerned this election cycle , however, in a recent podcast with \u201cThe Church Boys\u201d: \\n\"The biggest thing for me is the Supreme Court justices\u2026 because, no matter who wins this election, it\u2019s four years, maybe eight, if they\u2019re reelected, but that\u2019s the maximum. \\nThe Supreme Court justice seats will be until those people die \u2014 and that could be a very long time.\" \\nA number of Americans share Bure\\'s concern, noting the age of several sitting justices. \\nAccording to ballotpedia , with the increasing likelihood that Justice Scalia\\'s seat will remain empty into the next president\\'s term, the next president could potentially appoint four justices: \\n\u201cThe average age at which a Supreme Court justice retires is 78.7 years old. Justice Kennedy will be 80 when the next president takes office, Justice Ginsburg will be 83, and Justice Breyer will be 78.\u201d \\nBure explained her concern by noting that she has spent time recently studying the \u201cbigger picture\u201d and the principles outlined by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution: \\n\u201cIf we get too far away from what our Founding Fathers wrote up for us in how this country will be different from all other ones, then we will lose it.\u201d \\nBut in order to hold on to what we have, Bure says that it\\'s not about putting faith in Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton \u2014 or any candidate, for that matter. \\nInstead, she says her faith remains unshakable in Jesus Christ, and that she will pray for the wisdom of whomever wins the election.
