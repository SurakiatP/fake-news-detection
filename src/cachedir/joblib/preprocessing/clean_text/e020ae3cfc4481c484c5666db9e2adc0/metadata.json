Trump, who in April of 2016 was named as the defendant in a lawsuit filed by Katie Johnson, is scheduled to appear before a court on December 16, 2016. The lawsuit alleges Trump, along with former banker billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, raped Johnson when she was thirteen. The incident allegedly happened in the 1990s. Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution in 2008, has also been associated with former President Bill Clinton, whose name appears in \u201c flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \u2018Lolita Express, \u2019\u201d a term used in association with Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 jet. The jet was allegedly set up with beds where Epstein and guests \u201c had group sex with young girls .\u201d The lawsuit was first filed in April , but U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen Stevenson threw the suit out in May because Johnson then failed \u201c to state a civil rights claim .\u201d The plaintiff was representing herself at the time, claiming to be unemployed and having only $276 to her name. In June, Johnson went on to refile the suit in the Manhattan federal court. This time around, Johnson filed the suit under the name \u201cJane Doe,\u201d asking $75,000 plus attorney fees. But in September, Johnson dropped her lawsuit, only to have it refiled weeks later with three affidavits instead of two. While Trump is scheduled to appear in court for a status conference in December in reference to this case, it still requires more information before it leads to a trial or settlement. In contrast to Trump\u2019s case, Clinton\u2019s brush with the law is taking place at a different, more advanced level \u2014 but is still not close enough to conviction to ruin her chances of being elected. Just over a week before Americans head to the polls to cast their ballots, the FBI announced it would be reopening its the probe into presidential nominee and former secretary of state Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. The announcement followed the discovery of an email stash found on a laptop that belonged to former congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner\u2019s wife, Huma Abedin, is a longtime Clinton aide. She claims to have been unaware that her emails were on Weiner\u2019s device. Though the FBI has announced it obtained a warrant to review the 650,000 emails, it is unlikely the agency\u2019s investigation will achieve any results before election day. The FBI is seeking to determine whether the messages found on Weiner\u2019s computer include any classified information or evidence that may indicate Clinton undermined U.S. national security. In an article for Law Newz , Ronn Blitzer attempts to answer some of the questions the public might raise now that the FBI has announced the probe, attempting to determine how Clinton\u2019s legal future will look if she\u2019s elected president. While the law \u201c is hazy, \u201d Blitzer writes , he goes over several scenarios. First, he explains \u201c it\u2019s highly unlikely that an indictment would come before November 8 .\u201d If it happened, however, \u201c the indictment itself wouldn\u2019t mean that Clinton could no longer run, as an indictment is only an accusation, not a convictio n.\u201d Theoretically, he continues , \u201c the Electoral College could \u2026 go rogue and not vote for Clinton, even if their states tell them to .\u201d Another possibility is that Clinton would be pressured, either by the DNC or the public, to \u201c give up her candidacy. \u201d In the case Clinton wins but is indicted before her inauguration, \u201c she could try to play beat-the-clock and hope to take office before her case concludes .\u201d But if she\u2019s both indicted and convicted before the inauguration and then sentenced, \u201c she may be deemed incapacitated, in which case Section 3 of the 20th Amendment kicks in and the Vice President-Elect, in this case Tim Kaine, would become President .\u201d But if Clinton wins the election and is inaugurated as the investigation is carried on, \u201c Clinton would luck out ,\u201d Blitzer explains , \u201c due to the philosophy that Presidents \u2014 and only Presidents \u2014 [sic] are immune from prosecution while in office .\u201d Since the House of Representatives determined in 1873 that a president may only be impeached over offenses committed after their inauguration, Blitzer writes , impeachment over the email scandal isn\u2019t likely to take place. And even if she\u2019s convicted after moving to the White House, \u201c President Hillary Clinton could pardon herself .\u201d These scenarios could all play out fairly similarly in Trump\u2019s case, assuming the rape lawsuit filed against him leads to a conviction. But whether Clinton or Trump is elected, their federal or FBI probes may result in nothing more than footnotes in the grand scheme of things \u2014 especially once we\u2019re faced with the realization that elected officials are required to meet lower standards of conduct than the rest of us . Only after the FBI probe is finalized will we know if Congress is willing to tackle the presidential immunity rules. source:'"}, "time": 1742564412.3826094}
