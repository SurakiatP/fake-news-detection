An American son of diplomats born while his parents served in Pakistan, he has used his   savvy, policy smarts and easy manner to position himself, party elders assumed, as a potential Democratic speaker of the House. Instead, Mr. Van Hollen, now running for the Senate in his home state of Maryland, is fighting for his survival in an identity politics primary that raises an explosive question: Should a white man, or a black woman, inherit the seat held for 30 years by Barbara A. Mikulski, the   female senator in American history? The contest between two members of Congress  \u2014   the   Mr. Van Hollen, who trumpets his legislative r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and Representative Donna Edwards, a onetime community activist and   single mother  \u2014   has exposed deep fissures among Democrats as it traverses thorny issues of gender, race and class. It has especially split women. Emily\u2019s List, the political action committee that works to elect Democratic women, has spent more than $2. 5 million on television ads for Ms. Edwards, drawing a backlash from female supporters of Mr. Van Hollen, who say he is \u201cmore effective\u201d than Ms. Edwards and every bit her equal in championing women\u2019s rights. On Wednesday, more than 1, 000 \u201cstaunch Democrats and feminists\u201d from Maryland published an open letter saying just that. To Ms. Edwards, who worked as an activist to pass the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, the effectiveness argument is \u201cinsulting. \u201d Shaking hands and snapping selfies outside an early voting center here Tuesday night, she offered a succinct rationale for her candidacy: \u201cThe Senate is 100 members  \u2014   20 women. There\u2019s nobody in the Senate like me. \u201d As to the uproar over the push by Emily\u2019s List, Ms. Edwards said she was mystified: \u201cI\u2019m a   Democratic woman, and Mr. Van Hollen is not. \u201d Mr. Van Hollen, who helped muscle President Obama\u2019s health care legislation and other   bills through Congress as the   man to the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, cannot exactly argue with that. He is a    white man in a party that has a core coalition consisting of minorities, single women and young people. He has countered with a blitz of endorsements from 100 prominent   women in Maryland and from a string of female elected officials. Analysts say black women will decide the race. Perhaps nowhere is the fight for their votes as fierce as here in Baltimore, a majority black city that is about to choose its next mayor. Next week  \u2014   one day after Tuesday\u2019s Maryland primary  \u2014   the city will mark the   anniversary of the unrest over the death of Freddie Gray. The memory of the    black man, who died of injuries he sustained while in police custody, hovers over both races. So as Ms. Edwards was greeting voters Tuesday night, Mr. Van Hollen was at a restaurant across town, mingling with an enthusiastic, and racially mixed, group of supporters over a dinner of chicken and mashed potatoes. Older black women cooed over him. His host, a Baltimore County councilwoman, Cathy Bevins, who is white, said she had just sent Emily\u2019s List \u201ca nasty little email, telling them, \u2018Take me off your list.\u2019 \u201d The congressman, doing his best to avoid race and gender questions, reminded the crowd that he has Baltimore ties (his father grew up here) and of his attention to constituent service. He stiffened slightly when asked if the Senate needs a black woman\u2019s voice. Those who endorsed him, he said, can speak for themselves: \u201cThey want somebody with a track record of delivering real results. \u201d There has not been a black woman in the Senate since Carol Moseley Braun, the nation\u2019s first and only black female senator, left in 1999. In California, Emily\u2019s List is also backing Kamala Harris, who is black and   for a Senate seat this year. Here in Maryland, a  Monmouth University poll released on Thursday showed Mr. Van Hollen pulling ahead in what has been a tight race with voters, especially women, and starkly divided along racial lines. \u201cThis is the state that Harriet Tubman ran away from twice and Frederick Douglass ran away from at least once, and we\u2019ve never had a black woman elected statewide,\u201d said Benjamin Jealous, the former president and chief executive of the N. A. A. C. P. who supports Ms. Edwards, though he insisted it was for policy reasons, not her race. Maryland, a heavily Democratic state, is no stranger to rough primary campaigns, especially when there is a rare open seat. Ms. Mikulski, a gruff former social worker from East Baltimore, ran one herself 30 years ago. Then a congresswoman, she reached the Senate by beating a seasoned colleague, Michael D. Barnes, and a sitting governor, Harry Hughes, with the help of a new group: Emily\u2019s List. Ms. Mikulski, known on Capitol Hill as the \u201cdean of Senate women,\u201d is staying out of the fight over who should carry on her legacy she calls herself \u201cstudiously neutral. \u201d That has not stopped some of her admirers  \u2014     Van Hollen backers like Jamie S. Gorelick, a former deputy attorney general  \u2014   from accusing Emily\u2019s List of wasting its money by going after a rising Democratic star with a good record on women\u2019s rights. \u201cI used to give money to Emily\u2019s List,\u201d Ms. Gorelick said. \u201cI never will again. \u201d Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily\u2019s List, said the group was \u201cdoing what we have always done\u201d: leveling the playing field for women who run against   men. \u201cWe have an opportunity here to change the face of power in the Senate just as we did in 1986,\u201d she said. In some ways, Mr. Van Hollen and Ms. Edwards are mirror images of one another. Both are 57 years old. Both are lawyers. Both represent affluent districts in the suburbs of Washington  \u2014   his largely white, hers largely black. The race is being fought around the margins, over slight differences in policy, dueling endorsements and sharp contrasts in personal style. On the campaign trail, there have been nasty ads, insults and slights, filtered through the delicate prism of gender and race. When the Maryland Senate president, Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. who is white, called Mr. Van Hollen \u201ca leader who has been born to the job\u201d (a reference, an aide said, to his years in the Maryland legislature and childhood growing up overseas) it sounded to the congresswoman like talk from the  \u2019s network. \u201cMaybe the first generation to go to college, whose parents lived the American dream,\u201d Ms. Edwards said, referring to herself, \u201cmaybe that person is appropriate for the job. \u201d Still, Ms. Edwards has been disappointed that only four of 46 members of the Congressional Black Caucus have publicly endorsed her, though aides say 18 have donated to her campaign. With Mr. Van Hollen expected to win his district, and Ms. Edwards expected to win hers, Baltimore is a central battleground. Earlier this month, the congressman, in blue blazer and   shirt, was in a poor neighborhood, walking through a fruit and vegetable market trailed by a coterie of black women  \u2014   members of a health care workers union that supports him. Rena Kenely, 59, a volunteer at a community center that helps the poor, had stopped in for coffee that day. She said that she had never met Mr. Van Hollen, but that she knew of him and liked his policies on education. \u201cPeople think we vote by color, but we don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Kenely said. Yet as Ms. Edwards was shaking hands outside the early voting center, it was clear that for some   women, it is an agonizing choice. Sharon Green Middleton, a member of the Baltimore City Council, was there. She knows Ms. Mikulski well, likes and respects Mr. Van Hollen, and is \u201cstruggling, but leaning\u201d toward Ms. Edwards. \u201cThis is 2016,\u201d Ms. Middleton finally said. \u201c  women need a voice. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563871.5295386}
