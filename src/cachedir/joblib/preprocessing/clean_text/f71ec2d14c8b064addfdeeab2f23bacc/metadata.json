[\u201cThe European Court of Justice decision on the headscarf today will only strengthen   and xenophobic trends,\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said in a tweet.  \u201cQuo vadis Europa? (Where is Europe going? )\u201d he added. The response came as Turkey is locked in a mighty row with Germany, the Netherlands and other EU states over the blocking of Turkish officials from holding rallies abroad in the campaign for a referendum on expanding Erdogan\u2019s powers. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said it does not constitute \u201cdirect discrimination\u201d if a firm has an internal rule banning the wearing of \u201cany political, philosophical or religious sign. \u201d The   court was considering the case of a Muslim woman fired by the security company G4S in Belgium after she insisted on wearing a headscarf. Turkey last month said it was lifting a historic ban on female officers wearing the Islamic headscarf in the country\u2019s officially secular armed forces, the last institution where the wearing of the garment was forbidden.'"}, "time": 1742563923.7247782}
