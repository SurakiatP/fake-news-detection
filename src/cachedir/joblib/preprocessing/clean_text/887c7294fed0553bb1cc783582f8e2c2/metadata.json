S. electric grid. [On the former subject, Gorka said the Washington Post\u2019s   ultimately discredited story about the hacking of a Vermont utility by Russian operatives was the epitome of Fake News.   \u201cThis is a beautifully juicy example of just what the   media represents today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about truth. It\u2019s not about being the Fourth Estate. It is about maintaining a narrative. And there\u2019s a narrative out there, that has yet to be proven, that Russia somehow hacked our election. Not proven, sorry, fact. And now, a laptop had some malware on it. It wasn\u2019t connected to the system, but it\u2019s got to be the Russians, and it\u2019s got to be a hack on the whole U. S. energy grid. It\u2019s quite incredible. \u201d \u201cEven the backtracking is so embarrassing because the statement that they issued  \u2014   I don\u2019t think you got to the end of it  \u2014   ends with, \u2018Authorities say there is no indication of the hack so far. \u201d They falsely wrote a story, but it could turn out to be true!\u201d Gorka said. He agreed with Kassam that even though the Washington Post story fell apart, it will become \u201ca new meme in the \u2018Russia is hacking America\u2019 story,\u201d and will \u201cstick in the back of the mind of the uninformed reader, and will be raised again and again and again on NPR, and MSNBC, and CNN. \u201d \u201cYou can put money on that, Raheem,\u201d Gorka said. When Kassam said he would expect serious consequences from his editors and publisher if he manufactured a story like the phony electric grid hacking piece, Gorka countered that \u201cin today\u2019s world, at the other outlets, you\u2019d probably be promoted. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
