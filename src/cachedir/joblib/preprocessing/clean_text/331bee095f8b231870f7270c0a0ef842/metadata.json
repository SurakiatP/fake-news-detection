Appearing comfortable in his new role as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top cheerleader and weapon against Mr. Trump, Mr. Kaine bounded up to the microphone, then slipped easily between English and Spanish as he animated the mostly Latino audience by mixing political talk with homey reflections on his life. \u201cFe, familia y trabajo,\u201d he told the crowd of more than 5, 000 people at Florida International University, explaining that faith, family and work defined his life. But as Mr. Kaine sought to flex his language skills to appeal to Hispanic voters, he and Mrs. Clinton were also trying to mollify a growing backlash from the left against his record of support for global trade deals, which many voters in Rust Belt states blame for the loss of American manufacturing jobs. Mr. Kaine was one of 13 Senate Democrats to vote in support of giving President Obama \u201cfast track\u201d authority on the   Partnership, the   pact that has become a lightning rod this election year. In a clear sign of concern that the issue could be damaging, aides to both Democrats signaled on Saturday that Mr. Kaine would soon publicly adopt Mrs. Clinton\u2019s current position on the deal and say that he no longer supported it in its current form. After praising the   Partnership as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton said during the Democratic primary race against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont that the pact did not meet her \u201chigh bar\u201d on protecting American workers. Progressive groups have offered mixed reviews of Mr. Kaine, with MoveOn. org Political Action saying it supports him in light of the \u201cracist, bigoted\u201d message coming from Mr. Trump. Democracy for America, a liberal group that backed Mr. Sanders, agreed with the   sentiment but said the selection of Mr. Kaine was not helpful to the progressive movement. \u201cKaine\u2019s support for   authority for the     Partnership and recent backing of bank deregulation will make our work more difficult,\u201d said Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of Democracy for America. Liberals looking for a sign from Mr. Sanders himself did not immediately get one. Shortly after Mrs. Clinton offered Mr. Kaine a spot on the ticket, he called Mr. Sanders. But Mr. Sanders, who endorsed Mrs. Clinton only about two weeks ago, did not comment about her   selection or mention it on Twitter on Saturday. A spokesman said Mr. Sanders would most likely discuss the pick in his interviews on Sunday talk shows. Some supporters of Mr. Sanders on social media said the choice of Mr. Kaine was more evidence that their \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d missions must continue. Others who were resigned to Mrs. Clinton, however, said they could live with her decision. \u201cHe is more than competent for the job,\u201d said Steve Todd, a delegate for Mr. Sanders from Pennsylvania. Larry Cohen, an adviser to the Sanders campaign and a former president of the Communications Workers of America, said of Mr. Kaine, \u201cPeople are minimizing the range of this man by putting him in some box I would argue he doesn\u2019t belong. \u201d Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine sought to address the complaints  . Mrs. Clinton highlighted his work on fair housing issues and gun control in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech shooting that killed 32 people in 2007, when Mr. Kaine was the governor. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cBehind that smile, Tim also has a backbone of steel. Just ask the N. R. A. \u201d The rollout of Mr. Kaine\u2019s candidacy in Florida was no accident. The state is a crucial battleground, and Mrs. Clinton is moving to press her advantage with the state\u2019s Hispanic voters, many of whom have been turned off by Mr. Trump\u2019s   immigration policies. Mr. Kaine, who took a year off from Harvard Law School to work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, wasted little time showing off his bilingualism, often thrusting his fist in the air and looking back and flashing a wide grin at Mrs. Clinton, who sat on a stool behind him. \u201cBienvenidos!\u201d he told those in the crowd, welcoming them in Spanish and declaring that he and Mrs. Clinton would be \u201ccompa\u00f1eros de alma in this great lucha ahead,\u201d Spanish (mostly) for \u201csoul mates in the fight ahead. \u201d Mr. Kaine offered a folksy emotiveness that could ease concerns among Democrats that Mrs. Clinton appears too stilted and scripted at times. Mr. Kaine, who dislikes teleprompters, often veered off his prepared remarks, seeming elated to be under such a bright spotlight. Mrs. Clinton seemed to feed off the energy her new running mate gave the crowd as he alternated between zingers about Mr. Trump and a bit of braggadocio. \u201cI\u2019ve never lost an election,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cI\u2019m not about to let that change. \u201d Discussing how he weathers attacks from the National Rifle Association and other groups, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s just like an extra cup of coffee to me, folks. \u201d David Axelrod, a former chief strategist for Mr. Obama, criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s delivery, writing on Twitter that \u201csomeone, at long last, needs to urge her to let the mic do the work!\u201d But he praised Mr. Kaine as \u201cnatural, engaging, connecting. \u201d In an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump\u2019s rollout of Mr. Pence, when he dominated the microphone as his   candidate stood silently for much of the time, Mrs. Clinton perched on a stool, nodding and cheering, behind Mr. Kaine as he spoke for about 40 minutes. During Mr. Kaine\u2019s speech, the Trump campaign sent out emails in rapid succession, citing his \u201c \u201d record in Virginia, claiming he lacked any achievements as governor and deriding him as a career politician. After a search that began in April, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers hoped Mr. Kaine could help her bridge the wide divide she faces with male voters, who favor Mr. Trump by 13 percentage points, according to the latest New York   News poll. White men favor Mr. Trump by 26 percentage points. Mr. Kaine\u2019s positions on trade could also hurt the Democratic ticket in this regard. Part of Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal has been his steadfast, if unspecific, promise to bring jobs back to economically depressed parts of the country, largely attributing the decline to the   Partnership, which his own running mate also supported. \u201cTim Kaine has been praising the   Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved,\u201d Mr. Trump posted on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cJob killer!\u201d Mr. Kaine, though, seemed to relish the fight, criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s business record and foreign policy positions. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen again and again when Donald Trump says he has your back, you better watch out,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628415.9918766}
