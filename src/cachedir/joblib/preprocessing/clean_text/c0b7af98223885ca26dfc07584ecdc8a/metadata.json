While her parents worked at cleaning jobs, she hid her status in high school until a guidance counselor helped her get into the State University of New York at Binghamton to study American history. She was a junior there when, in 2012, President Obama gave Ms. Luna  \u2014   and hundreds of thousands of other young people like her \u2014   temporary permission to stay and work in the United States. She could become a teacher. \u201cFor the first time, I felt like this country accepted me,\u201d said Ms. Luna, 25, who now teaches social studies at a middle school on the Lower East Side. But now, she does not know what to think. During the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump promised he would cancel the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that Mr. Obama initiated. But in comments he made to Time Magazine last week, the   seemed to soften his stance. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d Mr. Trump said, without offering specifics, though a Senate bill with bipartisan sponsorship introduced last week would continue DACA\u2019s protections for three years. In the interview, Mr. Trump said of the young immigrants: \u201cThey\u2019ve worked here, they\u2019ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they\u2019re in   land because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. \u201d On that, Ms. Luna agreed. \u201cFor someone like me, that uncertainty still looms,\u201d she said. Across the country, more than 740, 000 young immigrants, often called Dreamers, are wondering what will happen to the   work permits granted through DACA. They work in fields like education, law, medicine, finance and government. About 30, 000 live and work in New York City, officials say. At the age of 5, Chandrapaul Latchman was brought by strangers on an airplane from Guyana to reunite with his parents on Long Island. He became student body president of Valley Stream Central High School, an honors student at Baruch College and an intern at BlackRock, the investment firm, before going to work at JPMorgan Chase. Today, at 23, he is one of the bank\u2019s 100 credit risk analysts, assessing   loans to real estate developers and entertainment companies. He knows what he would feel were Mr. Trump to cancel the program, known as DACA. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of rejection,\u201d Mr. Latchman said. \u201cEven though you tried so hard, and outworked so many people to get here, still at the end, you\u2019re not good enough and they don\u2019t want you,\u201d he said. Because Mr. Obama initiated the program by executive action, Mr. Trump could still revoke it with the stroke of a pen. It does not need congressional approval. Without the right to work legally in the United States, the Dreamers could see the accouterments of   life  \u2014   a studio apartment in Brooklyn, a driver\u2019s license, a biweekly paycheck with deductions for retirement, a coveted desk in a financial firm  \u2014   disappear. Some viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s latest comments as polarizing, continuing a narrative from his campaign. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to differentiate between the good immigrants and the bad immigrants  \u2014   however he chooses to qualify them,\u201d said Hina Naveed, 26, a registered nurse on Staten Island and a   of the activist group, Dream Action Coalition. \u201cInstead of just working it out with the Dreamers, what I\u2019d rather see is some clear policy in what he\u2019s hoping to work out with immigrants in general. \u201d Otherwise, she said, the alternative is frightening: \u201cWe\u2019ll save DACA and all their parents will be deported  \u2014   who will want to stay here?\u201d Mr. Latchman said that even before Mr. Trump was elected, his manager suggested exploring other offices around the world, like the one in Toronto. His work permit expires in the summer of 2018, about the time his   contract with the bank ends. A JPMorgan Chase spokesman, Andrew Gray, said that it was too early to discuss what was still a hypothetical situation. He emphasized that Mr. Latchman was speaking personally, and not on behalf of the company. In many cases, employers, whether they are private or government entities, may not know if an employee has a work permit through DACA unless that person discloses it. And there is little any employer can do if an employee\u2019s work authorization is canceled. But Teach for America, the national organization that trains and recruits young teachers to work in schools in   communities has, since 2013, made a point of hiring and supporting teachers who are covered by the program, helping with application fees and moving. Now it has pledged to offer legal and financial support to the 146 corps teachers who could lose their work permits. Ms. Luna, who works at the Great Oaks Charter School, said she would apply for a transition grant that Teach for America offers for resettlement. In her case, she might need the money to break her lease on her $   studio and move back in with her parents, who live in Port Chester, N. Y. Antonio Vance, the executive director in New York for Great Oaks Charter School, said he had already consulted lawyers to help Ms. Luna. \u201cShe\u2019s only been here a year, and she\u2019s already a model teacher,\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cIt would be difficult to replace her and the relationships she has formed with her students. \u201d Ms. Luna said that if were she to lose her work permit, she would consider going back to school for a degree in administration in hopes of one day opening her own school if the law changes. She already has a master\u2019s in urban education and policy. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to say it won\u2019t devastate me. But it would ignite more of a fire inside me,\u201d she said, referring to her ambition to remain a teacher in the United States. Others said their fallback plan might mean retreating to the underground economy. Juan Carlos P\u00e9rez, 31, a math teacher at the International High School at Union Square, said he might have to return to teaching English as a second language in Queens for a small stipend or even return to Mexico, which he left at age 11. Joe Luft, the executive director of the Internationals Network for Public Schools, which operates 15 high schools in New York City that specialize in teaching new immigrants, said losing people like Mr. P\u00e9rez could adversely affect the students who had come to confide in him. \u201cI really fear what that does to their sense of hope, which can be tenuous to students anyway,\u201d Mr. Luft said. According to an immigration lawyer, Stephen   Mr. Trump could still cancel the program immediately, or let the existing   work permits simply expire. Ms. Naveed, whose family is from Pakistan, came to New York when she was 11 because her older sister needed medical treatment they came legally, but overstayed their visas. In May, Ms. Naveed was able to get a nursing license because the New York State Board of Regents allowed people covered by DACA to be eligible for 57 professional licenses. As a private home nurse, she now changes and maintains the tubes that allow a    baby to breathe and eat. Ms. Naveed said it would be \u201ca significant loss\u201d of independence to no longer be able to work and take part in her community openly. Still, she said, \u201cBefore DACA people survived, and after DACA people will survive. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563614.3605583}
