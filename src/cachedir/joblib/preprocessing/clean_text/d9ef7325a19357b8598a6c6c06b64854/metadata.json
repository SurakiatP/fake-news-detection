In a letter to Mr. Trump, the former government officials and experts said even the   order will \u201cweaken U. S. security and undermine U. S. global leadership. \u201d And they said it continues to signal to Muslim allies that  \u2014   as the Islamic State and other extremist propaganda profess  \u2014   the United States is an enemy of Islam. Several of the 134 signatories served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, including R. Nicholas Burns, who was on the National Security Council staff and a senior diplomat during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration before becoming under secretary of state for President George W. Bush Richard A. Clarke, the National Security Council counterterrorism coordinator for Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton and John E. McLaughlin, the deputy C. I. A. director for Mr. Clinton and acting C. I. A. director for Mr. Bush. But the vast majority of those who signed the letter  \u2014   including Madeleine Albright and John Kerry, the former secretaries of state Mich\u00e8le A. Flournoy, the former under secretary of defense and Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser  \u2014   rose to senior security jobs in government under Democratic presidents. Their argument mirrors one also being made by states that claim the revised travel ban discriminates against Muslims and will hurt businesses and universities. A week after taking office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order to suspend the nation\u2019s refugee program as well as travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries to give the government time to install rigid security vetting of immigrants. The order created chaos at American airports nationwide and was blocked by a federal appeals court. This week, the Trump administration issued a new order that slightly scaled back the original ban but is still considered a significant hardening of American immigration policy. \u201cBans like those included in this order are harmful to U. S. national security and beneath the dignity of our great nation,\u201d said the letter, which also was sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly and Michael P. Dempsey, the acting director of national intelligence. \u201cThe revised executive order is damaging to the strategic and national security interests of the United States,\u201d the letter said.'"}, "time": 1742561935.0504205}
