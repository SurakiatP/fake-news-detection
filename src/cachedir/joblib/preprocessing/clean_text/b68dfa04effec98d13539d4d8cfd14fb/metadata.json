It\u2019s no longer time to look back, but to look forward. And what do we see? When it comes to fashion  \u2014   or more important, fashion as it affects life  \u2014   there will be interesting times ahead. Here are some opening thoughts on what to watch for in the coming months. A new look in Washington and Paris. Pantsuits  \u2014   at least on women  \u2014   are out. So are the     look and the   look of men in   shirt sleeves. In Washington, we are entering the era of the boxy, oversize suit, the big knot, the   tie, and, maybe, European brands. As the Trump administration prepares to move into the executive wing, fashion  \u2014   and the American capital  \u2014   are preparing for a whole new style statement. The inauguration this month will throw down the gauntlet. What the   will wear (Brioni is my best guess) may ultimately be less significant than what his wife and eldest daughter will wear. Judging by the designs that Melania and Ivanka Trump wore on the campaign trail and on New Year\u2019s Eve, the age of American designers in the White House may be over. On Dec. 31, after all, Melania celebrated in a black Dolce  Gabbana sheath (Stefano Gabbana, Instagramming the news, proudly joined the \u201cI will dress Melania\u201d camp). And previously, when stumping for her father, if not in her own brand, Ivanka opted for Roland Mouret and Alexander McQueen. If that pattern continues, that\u2019s as big an upending of the soft status quo as anything Mr. Trump has pledged. Come Jan. 20, we\u2019ll get the first real sense of what to expect. In France, where voters go to the polls in April and May, a   candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, is known for combining Savile Row tailoring and Italian style, as well as for his fondness of red socks from Gammarelli (official tailor to the pope). By contrast, his   opponent, Marine Le Pen, has been characterized as promoting an image that is \u201cmumsy\u201d and \u201cfrumpy\u201d  \u2014   and not remotely   in contrast with Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May  \u2014   perhaps to try to make her party, the formerly fringe National Front, more accessible. Either way, the   Pen oppositional   should have a   effect on fashion. Also on the runways. More upheaval on the  runways.  This year, the name to watch is indubitably Raf Simons, who makes his debut at Calvin Klein at New York Fashion Week in February, with a promise of shaking up the whole system. He\u2019ll introduce his vision for the brand with a dual men\u2019s and women\u2019s wear show, thus giving his seal of approval to the new      trend, which extends from New York to London and Milan, and which includes Gucci, Burberry and Bottega Veneta. Think of it as the bandwagon of the sexes. And more cultural action off the runways. It\u2019s going to be a banner year for fashion exhibitions. In February, in the middle of fashion month, Kensington Palace in London will host \u201cDiana: Her Fashion Story,\u201d a collection of garments worn by the princess in the 1980s and \u201990s. In July, just before the couture shows kick off, the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris  will present \u201cChristian Dior. \u201d And in between those two openings, three major retrospectives will be unveiled in May: \u201cBalenciaga: Shaping Fashion,\u201d at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London \u201cThe World of Anna Sui,\u201d at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London (the first retrospective of an American designer to be held in Britain) and, of course, \u201cRei   des Gar\u00e7ons\u201d at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute. The Met show should provide the best   moments of the year, as   gala attendees attempt to honor Ms. Kawakubo\u2019s work, which focuses less on beauty than on the question of what clothing is. It should give new meaning to the concept of wearable art. Then there are the movies. On the subject of the Met and the Costume Institute gala: The   Party of the Year is set to play a pivotal role in the coming   remake of the film \u201cOcean\u2019s 11,\u201d called \u201cOcean\u2019s 8. \u201d Then there\u2019s a new crop of fashion biopics in the works, and they are doozies. Jack O\u2019Connell has been signed to play Alexander McQueen in Andrew Haigh\u2019s movie on the British designer, which is set to start filming in the spring Daniel   will channel Charles James for Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s    movie about the   couturier, who was the subject of a Met show in 2014 and on the small screen, Lady Gaga will be Donatella Versace in \u201c : American Crime Story,\u201d the third season of the FX television drama. Will this help or hurt the increasingly intertwined relationship between Hollywood and high fashion? Reviews, and box offices, will tell. The wedding of the year. O. K. they haven\u2019t set a date, but there\u2019s little doubt that the marriage  of the tennis great Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian,   of Reddit, is going to be a style grand slam. Between Ms. Williams\u2019s avowed interest in fashion  \u2014   see the outfits she designs for Nike, as well as her own line  \u2014   and her willingness to take risks with tradition, her B. F. F. status with the American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, and her status as a crown princess of the BeyHive (see her appearance in Lemonade, this could put a whole new spin on nuptial trends. Pun intended.'"}, "time": 1742561930.744619}
