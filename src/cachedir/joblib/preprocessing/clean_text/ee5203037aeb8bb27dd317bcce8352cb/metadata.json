FBI agents have put advisers close to GOP candidate Donald Trump under close scrutiny, searching for financial connections that some have alleged exist between the nominee and Russian financial figures. They even followed up on a lead hinting that there had been a secret email correspondence between Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Organization and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alfa-bank. All the while, the bureau has been searching for the hackers that breached the computers of the Democratic camp and leaked emails that became the source of many scandals damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign.\\nNonetheless, the FBI still cannot say that any of its investigations have uncovered direct links between Trump and Russian authorities, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing recent interviews and its own bureau sources.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153No evidence has emerged that would link [Trump] or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election operations,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d writes the NYT.\\nOfficials also anonymously told the NYT that whoever the hackers were, the attacks were aimed at disrupting the presidential race on the whole, and not boosting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of getting into the Oval Office, as the Western media and Democrats have been claiming.\\nIn explaining why Russia would want to interfere in the campaign, one senior official was cited as saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about the election\u00e2\u20ac\u015a It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a threat to democracy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\nThe FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiries will continue, however. In interviews over the past several weeks, intelligence officials have signaled that they have opened a larger probe to look into suspicions over connections between Trump aides and Moscow.\\nIn the most recent lead, an anonymous computer scientist going by the name Tea Leaves found some 2,700 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look-up\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d messages that tied a server being used by one of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies to those of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alfa Bank.\\nStill, the FBI found that there was no two-way communication, and these messages could have been marketing emails or spam. Both the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank issued statements denying that they had been in communication.\\n\\nThe FBI is also probing Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose foreign business and political dealings have come under scrutiny since reports surfaced claiming he was involved with a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, NBC reported, citing intelligence sources.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRussia hacking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vs Clinton emails \\nA separate report from CNBC citing a former FBI official claims that the bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, James Comey, was privately reluctant about naming Russia as the entity responsible for meddling in the US election campaign, reportedly saying it was too close to the November 8 Election Day.\\nIn the beginning of October, Comey allegedly concluded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a foreign power was trying to undermine the election,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but arguing against putting it out before the election itself.\\nHe also allegedly made sure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not mentioned in the document compiled by the US government on October 7, which officially accused Russia of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authorizing\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the hacking of emails accounts of US officials and organizations, out of concern that the FBI would be seen as interfering with the election if it was included.\\nHowever, last Friday, with the election mere days away, Comey announced that the bureau was reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton because several hundred thousand new emails that may be related to the private server used by the Democratic nominee had allegedly been discovered.\\nThe announcement, which left many in the government puzzled, has already resulted in official complaints and attacks from the entire US political spectrum. On Monday, some 100 former federal prosecutors and senior Department of Justice officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, signed a letter expressing concern over Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to reopen the case \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the eve of a major election,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the mere disclosure of information may impact the election\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outcome\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d at this stage.\\nClinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters have accused Comey of deliberately hiding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explosive\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d information about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged ties to Russia, demanding that he discuss them publicly, just as he did with the new batch of Clinton-related emails.\\nHillary Clinton and her supporters have repeatedly criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Trump has retorted that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to do\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d with Russia and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know its leader personally.\\nPutin on accusations of meddling: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrubbish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \\nRussia, in turn, has denied having any links to the Trump camp on numerous occasions, while refuting accusations that it had been behind the hacking attacks on the Democrats, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rubbish\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d last week.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi last Thursday, stressing that this had been done deliberately.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he added, while explaining that Russia does not prefer any particular candidate and is ready to work with either of them. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president also stressed that friendly words and intentions to normalize relations between the US and Russia are always welcome, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whoever expresses them.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742628511.5666933}
