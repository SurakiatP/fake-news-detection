Fewer!\u201d Wilders answered: \u201cWe\u2019re going to organise that.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nWilders said Friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer Geert-Jan Knoops and instead \u201cgo to work\u201d in the parliament in The Hague. \\n{snip} \\nJudges earlier this month dismissed arguments by Wilders\u2019 lawyers that the trial was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d adding they did not believe it will impact the PVV\u2019s election campaign. \\nPoliticians \u201care granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position,\u201d the judges ruled last month. \\n\u201cPrecisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements.\u201d \\nWilders hit back Friday saying \u201cit is a travesty that I have to stand trial because I spoke about fewer Moroccans.\u201d \\n\u201cMillions of Dutch citizens (43 percent of the population) want fewer Moroccans,\u201d he claimed. \\n\u201cNot because they despise all Moroccans or want all Moroccans out of the country, but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many Moroccans.\u201d \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742563377.170589}
