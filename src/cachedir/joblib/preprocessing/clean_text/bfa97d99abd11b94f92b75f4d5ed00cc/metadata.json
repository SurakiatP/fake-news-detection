[Speaking of Snowden, Ms. Winner is a huge fan of his. He was one of only 50 accounts she followed on Twitter, along with WikiLeaks, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif, and the Anonymous hacker collective. Her own Twitter posts were filled with       tirades such as, \u201cWhy burn a flag? Donald Trump thinks crosses burn much better. \u201d  She was also a supporter of climate change hysteria and the Black Lives Matter radical movement. Her last Tweet, from February, was advice for rapper Kanye West to \u201cmake a shirt that says, \u2018being white is terrorism. \u2019\u201d She didn\u2019t just follow the Iranian Foreign Minister, she tweeted at him. \u201cThere are many Americans protesting U. S. government aggression towards Iran. If our Tangerine in Chief declares war, we stand with you!\u201d she gushed to Zarif. She also referred to President Trump as \u201cthe orange fascist we let into the White House,\u201d and some other names that cannot be reprinted at a   website without exceeding our allotment of asterisks for the day. \u201cOn a positive note, this Tuesday when we become the United States of the Russian Federation, Olympic lifting will be the national sport,\u201d she sneered in advance of the 2016 election. The totality of the Reality Winner experience reads like a joke put together for a presentation by bored NSA staffers about the sort of person that should never, ever be given a security clearance. It\u2019s as though a   blog downloaded itself into a human brain and chose a name by reading its own comments section.  It should also be noted that the circumstances of this Iran fangirl\u2019s data theft are a blistering indictment of agency procedures. Even with a valid top secret clearance, Winner had no legitimate reason to see the documents she allegedly purloined. She was only caught because the website she reportedly leaked to contacted the NSA to ask if her material was legitimate. The agency that was stunned by how much sensitive material Edward Snowden managed to abscond with still doesn\u2019t seem to be properly compartmentalizing information and enforcing    rules. Fans of the \u201cDeep State\u201d keep saying Trump made a big mistake picking a fight with them, but if the adventures of Reality Winner are an indication of the Deep State\u2019s skill and discipline, Trump doesn\u2019t have much to worry about. Also, it\u2019s worth repeating that nobody voted to give the Deep Staters or Reality Winners control over America\u2019s national security, law enforcement, and foreign policy. Some hay has been made over Winner\u2019s support for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election, but that\u2019s not nearly enough reason to question someone\u2019s security clearance by itself. It is, however, fair to ask when the media will get around to asking Sanders if he disavows his treacherous supporter  \u2014   as the press would certainly be doing if a   MAGAphile supporter of Donald Trump, boasting a Twitter feed full of   causes and celebrities, had looted the NSA to help a \u201cresistance\u201d movement take down President Hillary Clinton.  In the alternate universe where that happened, you may rest assured the media freakout about Trump saboteurs threatening the very fabric of democracy has pushed all other stories off the front page today, and the upcoming Sunday talk shows are already booked solid. Of course, as we all know, Democrat politicians are firewalled from the misdeeds of their followers, and no   Climates of Hate are ever detected. Certain Democrats have no compunctions about actually encouraging criminality, secure in the knowledge their party will never be made to pay a price for going off the rails: Now more than ever we need whistleblowers to come forward. I created an official website on how to leak to the press https:  .   \u2014   Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) May 17, 2017,  Remember the Democrat   about President Trump supposedly compromising American secrets by warning the Russians about a terrorist plot? Some of them don\u2019t actually seem all that concerned about real leaks of sensitive information, as long as it furthers their political goals.  Democrats have created an        environment that\u2019s guaranteed to drive their more   supporters around the bend. If one believes, as Reality Winner evidently does, that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president who must be resisted by any means necessary, it\u2019s not difficult to justify lawbreaking or even deliberately damaging America, for the greater good of shoving that   usurper out of the White House.  Our security services absolutely must take this into account when granting clearances and sweeping sensitive departments for risky personnel. No one with Reality Winner\u2019s political beliefs can be trusted with anything sensitive, period.  Democrats created the environment in which   cannot be trusted in sensitive posts, not Donald Trump. Leftists and extreme NeverTrumpers excuse every offense against this administration by saying Trump brought it on himself, just by being himself. That\u2019s not how the rule of law works.  This   climate has to be shut down, and fast, before permanent damage to our national interest is inflicted, if that hasn\u2019t happened already. A few words from top Democrats about acknowledging elections, honoring their oaths, and respecting the Oval Office even if you despise the current occupant (remember that?) would be very helpful.'"}, "time": 1742561647.480393}
