It would have seemed a typical Saturday night in one of New York\u2019s largest   neighborhoods. Except that inside those storefronts and cafes, there was worry, disbelief and emergency meetings, prompted by President Trump\u2019s executive orders that temporarily banned   and green card holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Among those countries was Yemen. At the   Social Center, 20   business and community leaders from across the city met to share information in Arabic and English about friends and relatives detained at airports across the United States. Everyone knew someone, or was connected with someone on social media who was affected. They decried the president\u2019s executive orders. \u201cTrump grew up in Queens, Yemenis were his neighbors,\u201d Kaled Alamarie, 44, said. \u201cThat\u2019s his New York. \u201d Mr. Alamarie came to the United States when he was 10. He is a Giants season ticket holder and works for the city\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. His brother, Amrr, 24, was born in New York and is a director of the John Adams High School STEM Academy in Ozone Park, teaching math, science and technology. \u201cWhat drew me out today is that I have an immigration case pending for my wife,\u201d Amrr Alamarie said. His wife, from Yemen, has been unable to get a visa to the United States for two years and now does not know when that will happen. They have a    daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not seeing myself living that American life,\u201d he said. Yemen is embroiled in a war between rebels aligned with Iran known as Houthi and Saudi   fighters that forced the closure of the United States embassy in Sana in 2015. For Yemenis seeking American visas, most have had to go to Malaysia or Djibouti to wait. Under President Barack Obama, some Yemenis had their United States passports confiscated in Sana. \u201cEverybody\u2019s afraid,\u201d said Zaid Nagi, 38, who came straight from the protest at Kennedy International Airport to the emergency meeting. \u201cWhat kind of guarantee do we have if they don\u2019t honor a visa they issue themselves? Or a birth certificate? Where do they draw the line?\u201d Anas Alhajj, 26, said he was involved in student uprisings in Sana. He received asylum, and now works for a Yemeni newspaper based in Bay Ridge. He said he is worried that his status could be revoked. \u201cYou have to understand where we came from, there\u2019s a lot of hardship, dictatorships,\u201d Kaled Alamarie said. \u201cIn their mind, they\u2019re thinking that they\u2019re going to disappear, just like they disappear in Egypt, in Yemen. They just don\u2019t believe it. \u201d The meeting was organized by Debbie Almontaser, the president of the board of directors for the Muslim Community Network and a national board member of the     Committee. \u201cIf you know people who are at the airports, let them know to refuse to go back on the plane and not to sign any documents. Ask for a lawyer,\u201d she said to the group of men around the table. \u201cFear,\u201d she said earlier in the day, \u201cis reverberating through our community. \u201d But there was also pride. Ibrahim Qatabi, a legal assistant at a nonprofit, said that his   came by boat to the United States from Yemen. He then worked in Buffalo for the railroad. Mr. Qatabi\u2019s grandfather worked for the Ford Motor Company. \u201cAnd now to be treated as a   citizen?\u201d said Mr. Qatabi, 37, who works for the Center for Constitutional Rights. \u201cWe\u2019re not refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who were rejected today are relatives of U. S. citizens. \u201d Mr. Qatabi said he worried about the psychological effect this order, which has been described as a Muslim ban, could have. \u201cWhat we worry about more than ever is that Trump\u2019s executive orders will embolden and encourage people to be racist, to openly discriminate against minorities, against people who come from the Middle East and especially these seven countries. \u201d But one neighborhood activist in the   community in Bay Ridge was conspicuously absent. She said she thought the temporary ban was good policy. Kathy Khatari, an   who married into a   family and is a proud Muslim, said that she fully supported Mr. Trump  \u2014   cheers him, in fact. Ms. Khatari said: \u201cWho cares, as long as we know who we are letting in. Do you know an ordinary Yemeni from someone from ISIS? No  \u2014   because we don\u2019t. I\u2019ll take inconvenience for safety. \u201d Yemen was the site of the first counterterrorism raid that Mr. Trump authorized, an attack of Qaeda headquarters that had killed an estimated 14 Qaeda fighters and one American commando, the Pentagon said on Sunday morning. For those in Bay Ridge, the fighting seemed so distant. The manager of the popular Yemen Caf\u00e9 on Fifth Avenue, Nasser Alsubai, 28, disagreed about the imminent danger, or implication that people seeking to come to the United States from these seven countries were terrorists. He is a United States citizen, naturalized after he came to New York at age 6. \u201cAny Yemeni family that you find here in America are all working hard to support family in Yemen,\u201d Mr. Alsubai said. \u201cHow is going to make things better toward his agenda?\u201d he added of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make us go back in time. Like the camps with the Japanese. We\u2019re fighting all over the world for every single country to have democracy, but we\u2019re not doing it here. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628536.6540499}
