[Addressing a recent attack against a monastery in Sinai in which an Egyptian police officer was killed, Almaqdesi said, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the goal of the brothers is to close in on all sides in the direction of occupied Palestine and fight the Jews with the intent of expelling them from Islamic lands. \u201d  Almaqdesi refers to the entire state of Israel as \u201coccupied Palestine. \u201d According to Almaqdesi, despite IS\u2019s fronts in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Libya and Afghanistan, \u201cour guiding compass is still the liberation of Jerusalem. The Jews have benefited from the abandonment of Islam\u2019s holy places they did so because of the estrangement of Muslims from their faith. \u201d Almaqdesi also addressed the attempts of the Islamic State group to continue firing rockets from Sinai and the Gaza Strip toward Israel. \u201cWe will continue firing at the Jews and we will continue in our attempts to commit attacks with the goal of harming Jews and their government in Palestine and in all the holy places. \u201d According to Almaqdesi, \u201cThe war in Sinai, the consolidation in the Gaza Strip, the attempt to gain a serious hold in Jordan and of course the war in Syria, will end with the control of the Caliphate and Sharia, and will end with the liberation of the   Mosque and Palestine. \u201cSyria is important and central and its place in Allah\u2019s Sharia is central, but   (Jerusalem) is also central   \u2026     and I know that it\u2019s high on the agenda of the brothers leading the (Islamic) State. We won\u2019t let the Jews continue defiling the   Mosque. We won\u2019t continue to let the Jews prevent Muslims from praying at  . \u201d Contrary to Almaqdesi\u2019s claims, Muslims are not barred from praying on the Al Aqsa Mosque with the exception of limited periods during any high security threats when Israel temporarily may restrict Muslim male youths from the site. In general, Muslims have   hour access to the Temple Mount and mosques on the site. In contrast, Israeli police, working with the Islamic custodians of the Mount, bar Jews from praying on the site at any time. Jews are only allowed to visit during select hours in the morning and cannot bring holy objects to the Mount, Judaism\u2019s holiest site. Meanwhile, Almaqdesi continued, \u201cThe Jews know that we present a challenge and the largest threat for them and so they try to use infidel Arab and Muslim leaders  \u2014   even Hamas has joined the war against Islam  \u2014   but they aren\u2019t fighting against a few thousand Mujahedeen, they are fighting Allah and Allah cannot be defeated, even if the Americans and Russians or even the entire world stand behind them. \u201d This isn\u2019t the first   threat to Israel\u2019s borders. Speaking on \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio\u201d in March 2016, Abu     a   Gaza Salafist jihadist allied with Islamic State ideology, claimed it was only a matter of time before the Islamic State\u2019s branch in the Egyptian Sinai carries out a \u201cbig operation\u201d in the Israeli resort town of Eilat and other parts of southern Israel. Ansari has since been arrested by Hamas and is currently in prison in Gaza. Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
