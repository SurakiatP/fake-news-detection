Now, with the stinging United Nations Security Council resolution on Friday condemning Israeli settlement construction as lacking any legal validity, Israeli politicians and analysts on the right, on the left and in the political center say Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s game may soon be up. The Israeli right, feeling empowered by the advent of the Trump administration, which is expected to be more sympathetic to Israel\u2019s current policies, is pushing Mr. Netanyahu to abandon the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, long considered the only viable solution to the conflict. Naftali Bennett, the leader of the   Jewish Home party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, with whom Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud Party compete for votes, is goading him to take on more extreme positions like annexing parts of the West Bank, adding to a sense in Israel that the real Mr. Netanyahu may have to stand up and decide which side he is on. \u201cHe has to choose between the international community and Bennett,\u201d said Shlomo Avineri, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cIt is not an easy choice, but he has to make a choice,\u201d Professor Avineri said, adding: \u201cIs Israel going to alienate itself from the whole world for the sake of settlement activity? And it is the whole world. Is this what Zionism is about?\u201d For a second consecutive day on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu denounced the departing Obama administration, publicly accusing it of having orchestrated Friday\u2019s Security Council resolution, despite denials from Washington. The United States refrained from using its veto power, as it had done many times before to shield Israel, and abstained in the    vote. \u201cFrom the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting. Referring to the American secretary of state, Mr. Netanyahu added, \u201cAs I told John Kerry on Thursday, friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council,\u201d and he said he was looking forward to working with   Donald J. Trump\u2019\u2019s administration when it takes office next month. The Foreign Ministry summoned ambassadors of countries that had voted in favor of the resolution for personal meetings with ministry officials in Jerusalem, despite the Christmas holiday, which some of those countries celebrate. In a highly unusual move, Mr. Netanyahu, who is also the foreign minister, summoned the American ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a meeting on Sunday night. Mr. Netanyahu also instructed his ministers to reduce their diplomatic activities and contacts with counterparts from the countries that had voted for the resolution for the next three weeks, until the American administration changes, and to minimize travel to those countries, according to Israeli news reports. In an additional step, the defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, instructed Israel\u2019s agencies to suspend contact with Palestinian Authority representatives on some unspecified civil matters, though the measure was not supposed to affect security coordination or meetings about water, agriculture and the economy. With the Israeli occupation in its 50th year and the peace process frozen, Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official and the Palestinians\u2019 veteran negotiator, called on Israel \u201cto seize the opportunity, to wake up, to stop the violence, to stop settlements and to resume negotiations. \u201d Mr. Netanyahu says he is ready for negotiations anytime, but with no preconditions. The Security Council vote seemed to have caught Israel off guard. \u201cI hope for Netanyahu\u2019s sake (and also for ours) that he knows the truth at least deep in his heart  \u2014   it was the chronicle of a failure foretold,\u201d Ben Caspit, a political commentator, wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Sunday. Many commentators said the Security Council vote partly reflected a history of conflict between Mr. Netanyahu and President Obama over the settlements and Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s anger over the Iranian nuclear deal. They also pointed to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s increasingly vocal backing of the settler cause. That includes his advancement of highly contentious legislation, known as the Regulation Bill, that would retroactively legalize settler outposts and homes built on privately owned Palestinian land and force the owners to accept compensation. Mr. Netanyahu and his attorney general had warned that the bill, which recently passed a first reading in Parliament, contravenes international law and could land Israeli officials in the defendant dock of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. \u201cAfter he said it, he rushed to vote in favor of the bill. Why?\u201d Mr. Caspit wrote. \u201cBecause of Bennett. The fear of the possibility that he would not be able to siphon seats from Bennett next time on Election Day caused him to act like a   grocery owner, instead of a national leader. \u201d Tzipi Livni, a former Israeli foreign minister and a leader of the   Zionist Union, wrote on Facebook after the Security Council vote, \u201cThe Security Council decision is bad for Israel and it is the result of Netanyahu\u2019s surrender to the extreme right. \u201d Even Haggai Segal, a prominent settler and the editor in chief of a   newspaper, Makor Rishon, wrote in recent months that the Regulation Bill had \u201cno chance\u201d because it would be invalidated by Israel\u2019s Supreme Court and would be used by the International Criminal Court \u201cto incriminate Israel for war crimes. \u201d Mr. Segal, who served jail time as a member of the Jewish Underground that maimed and killed Palestinians in the 1980s, wrote this summer, \u201cThe wise thing now is to make do with what it is possible to do, and not lose it all by insisting on impossible goals. \u201d Mr. Bennett did not seem deterred. In a statement to reporters on Sunday at the Western Wall in the Old City in East Jerusalem, Mr. Bennett said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to decide between two alternatives: surrendering our land or sovereignty. \u201d He added that steps would be taken in the near future to try to apply Israeli law in Judea and Samaria, the biblical terms for the West Bank. But some Israelis were skeptical that Mr. Netanyahu, in his third consecutive term in office, and fourth over all, would choose one side over the other. \u201cBennett knows that Netanyahu is not going to make a decision,\u201d said Shmuel Sandler, a professor of political science at   University, near Tel Aviv. \u201cHe may say he will go with both. So far, it worked. It is easier for Bennett because he is not the prime minister. Netanyahu wants to enjoy both of the worlds. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563708.7005987}
