Trump\u2019s trio of   selections on Friday served notice that he intends not only to reverse eight years of liberal domestic policies but also to overturn decades of bipartisan consensus on the United States\u2019 proper role in world affairs. Mr. Trump is moving quickly to realize his campaign\u2019s promise of a nation that relentlessly enforces immigration and drug laws views Muslims with deep suspicion     War II alliances and sends suspected terrorists to Guant\u00e1namo Bay or C. I. A. secret prisons to be interrogated with methods that have been banned as torture. At a time when American cities have been inflamed by racial tensions, police shootings and fears over homegrown terrorism, Mr. Trump made no conciliatory gestures toward Muslims, Mexicans or residents of   neighborhoods, all of whom he disparaged during his campaign. In his first major national security selections so far  \u2014   Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, for attorney general Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, for C. I. A. director and Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn for national security adviser  \u2014   Mr. Trump sent a clear message that he does not intend to use these personnel choices to build bridges to Democrats or the moderate and traditionally conservative Republicans who opposed the nationalist overtones of his presidential campaign. The reaction from Democrats was swift and sulfurous. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts demanded that Mr. Trump withdraw Mr. Sessions, while Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey charged that some of Mr. Trump\u2019s choices had \u201cdegraded and demeaned Americans. \u201d \u201cThe   has created a White House leadership that embodies the most divisive rhetoric of his campaign,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said. Mr. Trump swept into office promising to dispense with the political correctness of Washington\u2019s establishment, and his choices reflect that. President George W. Bush assembled a Republican cabinet with a variety of shades of conservative ideology, including some members who challenged the president. Mr. Trump\u2019s early decisions suggest he favors a cabinet that will echo his opinions. The choices also suggest that on the perennially vexing question of how the government should balance security and civil liberties, Mr. Trump will throw his weight firmly behind security, in matters of both counterterrorism and traditional law enforcement. Mr. Sessions, one of the Senate\u2019s most conservative members, defended Mr. Bush\u2019s authority to conduct wiretapping without a warrant after the Sept. 11 attacks. He has been a vocal supporter of military detention at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and sharply criticized the Obama administration for assigning lawyers to suspected terrorists and giving them the right to remain silent, even when arrested on American soil. He has said the United States should keep waterboarding  \u2014   a banned technique that the Obama administration considered to be torture  \u2014   as an interrogation option because it works. A former prosecutor with a history of racially tinged remarks, Mr. Sessions has voted against laws that protect gay people and guarantee equal pay for women. He has also supported efforts to roll back the Voting Rights Act. He has shown over two decades in the Senate that he believes the Justice Department should do more to crack down on illegal immigration. And he has supported strict enforcement of drug laws and opposed the d\u00e9tente that Washington reached with states that legalized marijuana. While the Obama administration has used the Justice Department to expand the definition of civil rights  \u2014   to cover gays, lesbians and transgender people, for example  \u2014   Mr. Sessions says the government should not be \u201ca sword to assert inappropriate claims that have the effect of promoting political agendas. \u201d \u201cJeff Sessions has a   record  \u2014   from his early days as a prosecutor to his present role as a senator  \u2014   of opposing civil rights and equality,\u201d Sherrilyn Ifill, the president and   of the N. A. A. C. P. \u2019s Legal Defense Fund, said in a statement. \u201cIt is unimaginable that he could be entrusted to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for this nation\u2019s civil rights laws. \u201d As one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest, most vocal supporters, Mr. Sessions has supported Mr. Trump\u2019s call for a temporary ban on immigration from Muslim countries. As the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer, Mr. Sessions would be in position to help put that ban into effect. \u201cWe have no duty to morally or legally admit people,\u201d he said this year. \u201cWe need to use common sense with the    of the threat. It is the toxic ideology of Islam. \u201d Along with Mr. Pompeo and General Flynn, he will thrust the charged phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d to the center of American foreign policy in a way that blurs the lines between a war on terrorism and a war on Islam. General Flynn, in particular, has used   language that even the most strident Republicans have avoided. \u201cFear of Muslims is RATIONAL,\u201d he posted on Twitter in February. He has described Islam as a political ideology that has turned into a \u201cmalignant cancer. \u201d Like Mr. Sessions, General Flynn favors an immigration ban and has expressed support for the idea of forcing Muslims in the United States to register with the government. He once erroneously wrote on Twitter that Shariah, or Islamic law, was in danger of taking over the country. Both Mr. Bush and President Obama believed that such assertions inflamed   sentiment, served as a recruiting tool for terrorists and antagonized countries in the Middle East that the United States needed as allies in the fight against violent extremism. Since Sept. 11, 2001, there has been bipartisan consensus that the best way to combat terrorism was to dismantle Al Qaeda and other networks while avoiding being seen as attacking Islam. Mr. Trump has shown no such qualms. Mr. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders contribute to the threat of terrorism by refusing to repudiate it, although Islamic leaders and advocacy groups have done so repeatedly, and often. \u201cSilence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in 2013. William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cThe ISIS Apocalypse,\u201d said Mr. Pompeo and other Trump allies \u201care operating on the assumption that it\u2019s something going on in the religion itself. \u201d \u201cIt is a sea change,\u201d he said, \u201cand it really changes the terms of the discussion about what to do. \u201d Should the Trump administration shape its counterterrorism strategy and broader foreign policy around these ideas, Mr. McCants predicted the United States would find itself at odds with its allies in Europe and the Middle East, which have long sought to separate violent extremists from the billions of peaceful mainstream Muslims. \u201cThis kind of rhetoric pushes them together and in a way creates a   prophecy,\u201d he said. Some analysts said they believed that Friday\u2019s selections were intended to reward loyalty and appeal to Mr. Trump\u2019s base. They held out hope that the next set of selections  \u2014   for secretary of state and secretary of defense  \u2014   would go to more moderate figures, much as Mr. Trump balanced out the selection of Stephen K. Bannon at the White House by naming Reince Priebus as chief of staff. On Saturday, Mr. Trump will meet with Mitt Romney in Bedminster, N. J. to discuss, among other things, the top post at the State Department, according to people close to the transition. Last week, he held similar discussions with Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina. \u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d said Peter D. Feaver, a political science professor at Duke who served in Mr. Bush\u2019s National Security Council, \u201cthe challenge for Trump is that he can\u2019t do all the work he needs to do, with the caliber of people he needs, just from within his core of supporters. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628573.0784104}
