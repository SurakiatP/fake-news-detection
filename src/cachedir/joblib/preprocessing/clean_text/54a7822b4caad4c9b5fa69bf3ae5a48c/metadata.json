It explores responses to grief, touching on the empty spaces, private and public, that loss produces, and the chaos, ritual and ceremony that help people fill the void. During the last week \u2014   with the mourners only just arriving  \u2014   Ms. Simon\u2019s anxious face suggested another title for the work: \u201cAn Impossibility of Knowing What\u2019s Actually Going to Happen. \u201d Traditionally, professional mourners are hired by families of the deceased to mark the occasion and to guide the dead to the place where they will lead their afterlife. Mourners are called upon to mark larger losses within their communities, like displacement or exile, in a cultural role that is part witness, part historian and part poet. At the Armory, their laments, wails and cries are also testament to their own bereavements. They can be political testimony, too. Aziz Tamoyan, who is Armenian, conducted a sound check with Ms. Simon last Wednesday evening, and gave voice for the first time in the    Drill Hall. His \u201ckilame ser,\u201d or \u201cwords about,\u201d addressed the Sinjar massacre in 2014, when 50, 000 Yazidis, an ethnically Kurdish religious community, fled to the mountains of Iraq to escape the Islamic State. His   lament, underscored by an oboe and a small amplifier which produced a droning baseline, rose up into the   vault of the Armory like fire turning softly to smoke  \u2014   an incineration of the heart\u2019s earthly bonds. Ms. Simon\u2019s mourners, with 13 companions, arrived, by somber happenstance, on the eve of the 15th anniversary of  . They came from Azerbaijan, which banned mourners when the country was a part of the Soviet Union Cambodia, where mourners were targeted by the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and Kyrgyzstan, in Central Asia, where mourners are heard on radio and television announcing tragedies and the deaths of   people. Three out of four applicants from Ghana were refused entry, without explanation, Ms. Simon said she declined to rock the bureaucratic boat by extending invitations to people she had identified as likely to be refused, like mourners in Syria. Something of an   star, Ms. Simon has had solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate Modern in London and venues from Berlin to Beijing, primarily as a photographer investigating the stories behind her images. She is represented by a star gallery, Gagosian. But \u201cAn Occupation of Loss,\u201d a   of the Armory and a London organization, Artangel, was an unsettling step out of bounds: performance, with many moving parts, a live audience, and the expectations that come with the Armory\u2019s   presentations. Ms. Simon collaborated with Shohei Shigematsu, director of the New York office of OMA, an architectural firm, on the installation: a cluster of 11 concrete towers, open at the top and 48 feet tall, that houses the mourners by nationality as they perform. It resembles a large pipe organ and operates acoustically as an instrument, giving harmony to the cacophonic language of loss. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how to scale or physically manifest the issue of loss,\u201d Mr. Shigematsu said by telephone. \u201cIt could vary from a tombstone to the World Trade Center memorial. We were careful to not make it too monumental, or too personal. \u201d Audiences of 50 will be admitted for each of seven   sessions. Visitors are free to roam the hall and enter the towers during the unscripted performances. The site will also be open, unoccupied, during the day. Visas and vetting are not typical   tools. Ms. Simon\u2019s team included Ida Nicolaisen, a professor emeritus of cultural sociology at University of Copenhagen, who helped to identify the mourners and their whereabouts through her academic network. \u201cWhen you look at how a culture grieves, you are looking at the core of that culture,\u201d Ms. Nicolaisen said at the Armory. Son Seng, a    Cambodian, studied professional mourning with a master teacher as the Khmer Rouge took control, when he kept his instruments buried beneath his teacher\u2019s house. After the Khmer Rouge withdrew and his master died, Mr. Seng, through an interpreter, said that he realized how important he was to the survival of the tradition, and devoted himself to reviving it. His two grandsons are performing with him at the Armory. Can mourners, and their work, be taken out of their own cultural contexts? \u201cWe went to great lengths in explaining this project to them,\u201d Ms. Nicolaisen said. \u201cAnd they said, \u2018Yes, we would like to do this.\u2019 They are very proud of their cultures. \u201d One night, Ms. Nicolaisen found herself grieving in the tones of the Punan people of central Borneo  \u2014   subjects of her 40 years of study  \u2014   while coping with the loss of her husband after a year\u2019s illness. She said that it broke her stubborn widow\u2019s silence and gave her peace. \u201cThis was a very beautiful tone, like opera,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe one of the reasons people love opera is because you can sing about the big feelings, let your emotions out, give it a full blast. \u201d Ms. Simon acknowledged that she also had experienced personal losses during the seven years it took her to realize the project, but she declined to elaborate, saying that she didn\u2019t want the piece to be interpreted as purely personal. She pointed to the broader, public roles of mourning that elected leaders assume in the wake of tragedy. \u201cLook at Obama  \u2014   the civic duty he has of leading mourning rituals for us as a nation when loss occurs,\u201d Ms. Simon said. Referring to the president\u2019s eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney  \u2014   one of the nine people shot dead in June at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston  \u2014   she recalled, \u201cwhere he sang \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019  \u2014   it felt spontaneous and real, yet it was completely performed and premeditated. \u201d The commemoration ceremony at the World Trade Center and its reading of the victims\u2019 names, is a collective mourning that continues to be necessary. Given what seems like an escalating history of violence, is it appropriate to make art of loss and grief? The subject has been raised recently by the imminent opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, which will display the original coffin of Emmett Till, the      murdered in Mississippi in 1955. \u201cI remember struggling with, \u2018Should we collect that?\u201d Lonnie G. Bunch III, the museum\u2019s founding director, told The Washington Post in August. \u201cWas that too ghoulish?\u201d The museum will have grief experts on hand to help viewers confronted by pain. Last week, at the Armory, as Ms. Simon greeted arriving mourners for the first time, questions of appropriateness were lifted away by the force of their performances. (Rebecca Robertson, president and executive producer of the Armory, said that the mourners were being paid the \u201cgoing rate\u201d for nonprofit performers, not professional mourners\u2019 fees, which are likely to be far less.) In one tower, Haji Rahila Jafarova and Lala Ismayilova, from Azerbaijan, dressed in black, slapped their chests and knees as they cried, an anguished response to the suffering of Shia Muslim heroes and martyrs, which they mix with stories of the deceased. Mourning is a profession for which women in Azerbaijan are particularly respected. Only female audiences will be allowed into their tower. On a recent visit, the Drill Hall looked like an underworld city of the dead: The women\u2019s disembodied voices echoed in it like something called to mind from deep memory. Inside another tower, three mourners from Greece, dressed in comfortable travel clothes, sat together on a ledge like old friends wizened by life and sang in a kind of call and response, their voices made piercing by the acoustics in the soaring column. Then, a carnival music hit the ear, like a distant radio station tuning itself in late at night. Festive, with a choppy,   sway, it was An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez, a mourner from Ecuador, introducing his \u201cyaravi,\u201d a song that speaks of the dead. In a dark suit and necktie, wearing dark glasses  \u2014   Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez is blind, as Ecuadorean mourners frequently are  \u2014   he stood up on his ledge, his short body saddled by a huge accordion, confronting life\u2019s great inevitability with singing. It was a music you would have followed anywhere.'"}, "time": 1742628458.588511}
