What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 The polls have closed in much of the United States. Donald J. Trump has won the crucial battleground states of Florida and Ohio along with more than 20 other states, leaving Hillary Clinton only a narrow path to the presidency. Check here for the latest numbers. Our reporters are providing   election analysis, and we\u2019re offering unlimited access to The Times through Thursday morning. _____ \u2022 Markets in Asia were trading lower  \u2014   Japan\u2019s stocks plunged  \u2014   and the prospect of a Wall Street   rose after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpectedly strong showing. For the first time in modern memory, both candidates are watching the results in Midtown Manhattan  \u2014   though across town from one another. \u2022 The Philippines\u2019 highest court ruled that Ferdinand E. Marcos, the former dictator ousted by his people after a brutal   rule, can be reburied in a heroes cemetery, as planned by President Rodrigo Duterte. The Marcos family welcomed the ruling and so did supporters, above, but many Filipinos expressed hurt and anger. A senator said the court had \u201cmiserably failed the test of history and broken our hearts. \u201d \u2022 Hundreds of lawyers marched through Hong Kong\u2019s central business district in a silent show of opposition to China\u2019s assertion of power over the city\u2019s judiciary. Some noted that local courts, which operate on common law, could still soften or even stymie the implementation of Beijing\u2019s decision to block two   politicians from taking office. _____ \u2022 South Korea\u2019s president, Park   is allowing her rivals in Parliament to pick a new prime minister in place of her own nominee, her latest attempt to defuse an   scandal. Prosecutors also raided the offices of Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest conglomerate, to investigate possible links to the scandal. Corruption has become a pressing issue for the country amid slowing economic growth. _____ \u2022 Ferocious battles have turned parts of the Syrian city of Aleppo into a moonscape of shattered buildings. Our reporter made a recent bus tour of the western,   part of the city, documenting scenes of stark destruction as well as the almost surreal contrast of seemingly normal life. _____ \u2022 India\u2019s   notes are now worthless. Prime Minister Narendra Modi devalued the   and   bills because they are frequently counterfeited or used for graft. \u2022 Iran signed its first major deal with a Western oil company since international sanctions were removed in the nuclear agreement. The preliminary $4. 8 billion deal with Total calls for the production of 1. 8 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. \u2022 American environmental groups protesting the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation are targeting a new group: banks that have helped finance the project. \u2022 Adjoining apartments in Hong Kong sold for an Asian record of more than $13, 500 per square foot. \u2022  Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets, which have been shaken by the American election. \u2022 A British banker was found guilty of murdering two Indonesian women at his luxury Hong Kong apartment, a case that exposed the underbelly of the city\u2019s financial sector. [The New York Times] \u2022 Singapore\u2019s prime minister said only Malay candidates would be allowed to run in next year\u2019s presidential race, to ensure there would be a president from the minority group for the first time in more than 46 years. [The Straits Times] \u2022 Hungary\u2019s Parliament rejected a proposal to bar refugees being relocated from the rest of Europe. [The New York Times] \u2022 Iraqi troops advancing on Mosul discovered a mass grave containing about 100 bodies, many of them decapitated. [The Associated Press] \u2022 A manhunt is on for two inmates who made an   escape from a London prison. [The New York Times] \u2022 Take a glimpse of Yarchen Gar, China, a wonder of the Tibetan highlands populated by Buddhist nuns. [The New York Times] \u2022 Two hundred mahouts and 11 elephants, powdered an auspicious white, paid respects to King Bhumibol, who died last month, at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. [Bangkok Post] \u2022 Prince Harry has had enough. The    grandson of Queen Elizabeth II blasted British news coverage and social media trolls for the \u201coutright sexism and racism\u201d unleashed on his biracial American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, above. \u2022 Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League is trying to make ice hockey popular in China, where the sport\u2019s traditional rowdiness seems not to have translated. \u2022 Iran, after years of isolation, global sanctions and bad press, is blossoming as a tourist destination for travelers from Europe, and even the United States, looking to explore the unknown. \u2022 Toblerone, the Swiss chocolate bar, has altered the   shape of two of its products. The redesign, which shrinks weight to avoid raising the price, has outraged some fans. \u201cIt is one of the most extraordinary works of art to come to the market in the last 10 to 15 years. \u201d That comment by Sotheby\u2019s chairman for Chinese art was reserved for an   musket made for the Qianlong emperor, who presided over what became China\u2019s last imperial dynasty. The gun is set to be auctioned today in London at an estimated price of roughly $1. 2 million to $1. 8 million. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had an imperial firearm,\u201d the Sotheby\u2019s executive, Nicolas Chow, said. Handcrafted out of wood, with components made of gold, silver and copper, the gun is over five and a half feet long. An inscription reads, \u201cSupreme Number One. \u201d Sales of Chinese art accounted for nearly a third of the global art auction market last year, according to a recent analysis. Mr. Chow said that many treasures were taken from the palace after the dynasty ended. Their return is viewed as a matter of national pride. The emperor\u2019s fondness for the weapon can be seen in a poem attributed to him, but a jade seal he used during his abdication might be the emperor\u2019s most valuable possession. Last month, an anonymous buyer paid nearly $12 million for the item. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
