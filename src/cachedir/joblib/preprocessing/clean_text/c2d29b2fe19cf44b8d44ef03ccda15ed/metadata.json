[According to ITV\u2019s Robert Peston, a source within the DUP \u201cwas very keen to be quoted\u201d as saying that his party \u201ccompletely backs [May\u2019s] vision of Brexit\u201d  \u2014   and not that of her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.  While both May and Hammond campaigned for a Remain vote during the EU referendum, the Prime Minister has subsequently endorsed what supporters call a \u201cClean Brexit\u201c taking Britain out of the bloc\u2019s Single Market and its associated Free Movement regime, as well as the Customs Union which precludes   from conducting an independent trade policy. Remain diehards, who want a \u2018Soft Brexit\u2019 in which Britain would remain party to the Single Market and Customs Union in order to maintain the closest possible links to the European Union, term this a \u201cHard\u201d or \u201cExtreme\u201d Brexit.

It had been claimed that the DUP, which is keen to see a minimum of economic friction between Ulster and the Irish Republic after Brexit, would at least back their calls for Britain to stay in the Customs Union. The ITV presenter has been led to believe that the DUP is \u201c100 per cent committed to the UK leaving the Single Market AND the Customs Union\u201d  \u2014   having preferred to use its bargaining power to press for plans to introduce   for the winter fuel allowance and scrap the pensions triple lock to be dropped. Leavers within the Government are predicting ferocious resistance to Brexit from without the Cabinet as well as within, with one minister predicting  \u201cutterly bitter, trench warfare\u201d as opposition politicians and Tory rebels \u201cfight us line by line, in committees, on the floor and in the Lords, for months and months on end. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563355.7357183}
