[The \u201cCNBC All American Survey\u201d recorded the highest level of economic optimism in its 10 year existence.   percent of the public say the economy is good or excellent, a four point improvement from December. Forty percent expect the economy to improve over the next year, which is close to the record set in 2010 \u2014  when the economy was in truly dire straits.  The survey also shows overwhelmingly strong support for Trump\u2019s plans to improve America\u2019s infrastructure, cut taxes, and renegotiate trade deals.  Nearly 75 percent of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s infrastructure improvement plans, with just around 10 percent disapproving. More than 60 percent of the public endorse plans to cut individual taxes, with just over 20 percent opposing. Renegotiating trade deals is favored by 58 percent of the public, and opposed by just over 25 percent. Reducing taxes also wins the approval of most Americans, but it generates opposition from over a third of the public. Cutting business regulations has an approval rating in the high forties, and a disapproval rating in the  . The results on trade show that while Americans are divided over the benefits of free trade \u2014  34 percent say it helps the U. S. and 31 percent say it hurts \u2014  they aren\u2019t divided on the president\u2019s efforts to strike better trade deals. According to CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman, even Americans who like free trade say they approve of those efforts.   percent of Republicans say that they want their party to \u201cwork to pass Trump\u2019s agenda\u201d rather than \u201chold the line on conservative positions. \u201d Democrats divide nearly evenly on whether their party should compromise with the president. The president\u2019s personal popularity is far weaker than his economic agenda. Just 39 percent say they approve of how he is doing his job, compared with 48 percent who disapprove, and 13 percent who said they don\u2019t know or were unsure. One reason for this may be that many of the most public actions taken by the Trump administration have been in areas where public support is weaker. Nearly half of Americans say they disagree with the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to replace Obamacare.  The border wall also divides Americans, with slightly more Americans opposing it than supporting it, according to the CNBC survey. Efforts to rollback some of the Obama administration\u2019s policies on climate change also have more opposition than support. The survey is not perfect. It\u2019s results show that nearly half of Americans oppose Trump\u2019s \u201cImmigration Ban,\u201d when there was no ban on immigration. Instead, the administration tried to put in place a temporary halt on travel from certain countries. Perhaps the actual question asked, which CNBC has not released, was less contentious.'"}, "time": 1742563138.1928933}
