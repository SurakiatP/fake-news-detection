He said Germany\u2019s acceptance of refugees is \u201cutterly catastrophic. \u201d The   One China policy embraced by the United States? That\u2019s up for discussion. Just days before Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration, world leaders on three continents are on edge after comments the   made in an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal and in a weekend interview with two European newspapers, Bild and The Times of London. \u201cIt\u2019s obsolete, first because it was designed many, many years ago,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to the German newspaper Bild. The   alliance, born in 1949, three years after Mr. Trump, is viewed by many  \u2014   including his nominee for defense secretary, Gen. James N. Mattis  \u2014   as essential to American security. \u201cSecondly, countries aren\u2019t paying what they should\u201d and NATO \u201cdidn\u2019t deal with terrorism. \u201d Responding on Monday to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, Dalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania, which gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and joined NATO in 2004, urged Mr. Trump to continue meeting the United States\u2019 financial obligations toward the alliance. Mr. Trump also criticized the European Union, describing it as \u201cbasically a vehicle for Germany. \u201d He praised Britain for its vote to leave the bloc, known as Brexit, adding: \u201cI believe others will leave. I do think keeping it together is not going to be as easy as a lot of people think. \u201d French leaders also bristled at Mr. Trump\u2019s swipe against the bloc. Their response comes as they deal with growing domestic support for the   Union and   party National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, who was spotted on Thursday at Trump Tower in New York. \u201cThe best response,\u201d said the French foreign minister,   Ayrault, \u201cis European unity. \u201d In the interview with The Journal, Mr. Trump said the One China policy was up for negotiation. Beijing responded quickly and decisively. Its Foreign Ministry called the policy, which recognizes Beijing as the sole Chinese government, the foundation of   States ties, and it said it was nonnegotiable. People\u2019s Daily, the mouthpiece of the governing Communist Party, said Mr. Trump \u201chas been stunningly confident in his ostensible knowledge of the job, though he speaks like a rookie. \u201d An unusually strongly worded editorial in the   China Daily said on Monday that Mr. Trump was \u201cplaying with fire with his Taiwan game. \u201d \u201cIf Trump is determined to use this gambit on taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves,\u201d the newspaper said. A spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned Mr. Trump on Monday that any effort to undermine the policy could backfire. Mr. Trump also took aim at German automakers, warning of a 35 percent tariff on any cars they build in Mexico and export to the United States. Shares of BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler fell on Monday after his comments, but BMW said the company would stick to its plans to open a plant in Mexico in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature,\u201d Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, Mexico\u2019s economy minister, said on Friday on a Mexican news show. \u201cIt would be a problem for the entire world,\u201d Mr. Guajardo Villarreal warned. Such a tariff \u201cwill have a wave of impacts that can take us into a global recession,\u201d he said. Not surprisingly, Russian diplomats were unperturbed by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on NATO. They welcomed the \u201cobsolete\u201d label and were enthusiastic at his suggestion that he would consider reducing sanctions against Russia if the country agreed to reduce its nuclear arsenal. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, said on Monday that \u201cNATO is indeed a vestige,\u201d according to Radio Free Europe. \u201cLet\u2019s wait until he assumes office before we give assessment to any initiatives,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563863.1559062}
