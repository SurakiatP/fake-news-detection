[The letter charges the PFA with breaching two provisions of FIFA\u2019s Statutes and two of the association\u2019s Disciplinary Code.  Included in those violations are Palestinian soccer competitions named after Palestinian terrorists, such as an annual contest named in honor of PLO founder Khalil    who, according to Palestinian sources, was behind the deaths of more than 120 Israelis. Rajoub himself, the letter says, has glorified violence and incited Palestinians, lauded recent terror attacks as \u201cindividual acts of bravery\u201d and noted that \u201che is proud\u201d of the perpetrators. He has also compared Israeli Jews to Satan. In February 2014 he called for the abduction of Israelis. Later that year three Israeli teenagers, Gilad Shaer, Naftali Frenkel and Eyal Yifrach, were kidnapped and murdered. Rajoub subsequently congratulated Hamas for carrying out the triple attack. He was quoted saying, \u201cIf we had a nuke, we\u2019d have used it [against Israel] this very morning. \u201d The letter also said PFA\u2019s boycott of Israel ran contradictory to FIFA\u2019s commitment to using soccer as a \u201cbridge to peace. \u201d Rajoub has called for the expulsion of the Israel Football Association (IFA) and may use an upcoming FIFA summit in Bahrain to promote the idea again. \u201cWe are aware that the Palestinian demand to expel the Israeli Football Association may be raised at the FIFA Council and Congress, respectively on 9 and 11 May,\u201d said Shimon Samuels, the European representative of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC). \u201cWe call, on the contrary, for the Palestinian Football Association to be expelled until all names of terrorists are removed from Palestinian teams, tournaments and stadiums. \u201d Ronald Lauder  \u2014   president of the World Jewish Congress (WJC)  \u2014   wrote to FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Thursday, telling him, \u201cThe campaign of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) to sanction Israel has no place on the FIFA Congress agenda. \u201d Rajoub himself is a former terrorist who spent 15 years in Israeli jails before being released in a 1985 prisoner swap. He has served in several senior positions in the PA, including chief of its secret police. Among the bereaved family members who signed the letter to FIFA were Brenda and Nachum Lemkus, whose daughter Dalia was slain in November 2014, and Doron Mizrahi, father of Ziv Mizrachi, who was murdered in November 2015. Brenda Lemkus said: \u201cOur darling daughter Dalia was murdered as a result of the constant incitement of the Palestinians and their glorification of terrorists. When we heard that the incitement and glorification of terrorists was so widespread in Palestinian football, we didn\u2019t think twice about joining the campaign and signing a complaint. \u201d Itamar Marcus, the director of Israeli monitoring group Palestinian Media Watch, which was in charge of gathering evidence against the PFA and Rajoub, said that if FIFA neglected to address the letter, \u201cit will be a disgrace for all the member associations and a permanent stain of FIFA\u2019s reputation. \u201d Last month, Rajoub received a court summons and compensation lawsuit for $250 million upon landing at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York over his alleged involvement in the killing of an   citizen in 1995. Azam Rahim\u2019s family, who live in the state of Texas, served the court summons on Tuesday. According to the charge sheet, on September 29, 1995 Rahim was arrested by Preventive Security officials and taken to a security facility where he was tortured to death.'"}, "time": 1742561924.4660795}
