Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017,  Partial transcript as follows: I want to thank F. Chuck Todd of NBC for opening my eyes to this. For the longest time I\u2019ve been genuinely curious why it is that media people think that they cannot be criticized. And they really do. They really think they can go out and research people and they can dig up dirt from anybody they want, their pasts, and they can broadcast it all over. And if somebody\u2019s life, somebody\u2019s marriage, somebody\u2019s relationship, somebody\u2019s kid gets destroyed or ruined, fine and dandy. They can do all of that they want, but you turn it around and you start investigating your favorite journalist to find out how many illegitimate kids he or she might have had in college or how many DUIs they had, you know, or how many communist sympathizer meetings they went to, then all hell breaks loose and they start squealing like stuck pigs, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that! We\u2019re journalists!\u201d I said, \u201cWhere does this come from?\u201d It\u2019s more than just hubris. I finally found out. You know what it is, Mr. Snerdley? These clowns actually believe that since they are recognized in the First Amendment that they have constitutional immunity. Criticizing them is attacking the First Amendment. They really believe this. Criticizing them is akin to attacking the Constitution, and that\u2019s   and that\u2019s why you hear these journalists say. \u201cIt\u2019s   to criticize. It\u2019s   for Trump to be destabilizing. It\u2019s   for Trump to be going out there and trying to do damage to the media. We\u2019ve got First Amendment protection. \u201d Well, so does the president, and the president happens to be mentioned in the Constitution before the media. The president\u2019s mentioned in Article 2. The media doesn\u2019t make it \u2019til the First Amendment. But yet the media thinks there\u2019s nothing bad about running around and trying to attack political figures and destroying them. This is what it is, folks. They are so far gone, they really think that they are the last line of defense between freedom and democracy and tyranny. And attacking them and challenging their reputation is no more and no less than attacking the Constitution and trying to destroy America and democracy. That\u2019s what they think. That explains why you can\u2019t go after them. Anyhow, let\u2019s take another brief break here. BREAK TRANSCRIPT, Look, the only thing the First Amendment does for the press is the same thing it gives everybody else. They can say what they want to say.  That\u2019s essentially what the First Amendment says for the press like it says it for you and me. It singles them out and references them in terms of their importance, a free and unintimidated, whatever, unattached media.  And nobody objects to that, but it does not grant them immunity from criticism.  It does not grant them freedom to be disagreed with. It does not grant them freedom from opposition. They seem to think that it does.  And I think it all falls under the notion of how really poorly constitutional education, American history education\u2019s been for decades in this country. Not to mention the kind of poison that\u2019s injected into the young skulls full of mush populating journalism schools all over the United States.  But really, folks, it\u2019s the one thing that, as far as the media\u2019s concerned, justifies what they\u2019re doing. Now, as I say, you won\u2019t even get them to admit what they\u2019re doing.  You won\u2019t even get them to admit they\u2019re trying to destroy Trump.  They come up with some, \u201cNo, no, no, no.  It is the job of the media to hold powerful people accountable. \u201d  Yeah.  Right.  Why doesn\u2019t that apply to powerful Democrats?  And don\u2019t tell me that it does, because everybody knows you give \u2019em a pass. Each and every time something comes up with \u2019em, you cover for \u2019em.  It\u2019s a joke.
