I truly don\u2019t feel like I deserve a certain kind of pass for my feminism or for my politics,\u201d Dunham said during an appearance on comedian Phoebe Robinson\u2019s WNYC podcast, Sooo Many White Guys.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re living your life in the public eye, you will fuck up and you will fall down, and the only power you have is to apologize and keep moving,\u201d Dunham explained. The    actress attempted to atone, specifically, for projecting sexist thoughts onto New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. when the two briefly shared a table at last year\u2019s Met Ball. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that this is in any way an excuse, [but] I move through the world feeling very awkward. It was at a table of notably beautiful women sitting there. I\u2019m just having the experience of being a   girl around what I consider to be like a hot, desirable athlete. So that was just projecting my own insecurity,\u201d Dunham said about falsely attributing comments to Beckham Jr. rejecting her \u201cmarshmallow\u201d  body that he did not make. \u201cI hadn\u2019t understood the way that it fed into a very dark history of, you know, black men being lynched for not responding to white women in the way white women felt they were supposed to be responded to,\u201d Dunham said, maintaining that she was simply ignorant of the implications of her actions. \u201cI understood the minute that that was pointed out to me what the issue was. I was seeing myself as the chubby    I am inside of myself, and not the person who is a cultural figure, who has the power to say something that could be hurtful and destructive. \u201d Later in the interview, Robinson, a black actress from New York City, grilled Dunham about the lack of   characters in the early seasons of her HBO show Girls \u2014  a raunchy    dramedy about four privileged white girls living in the   Bronx. \u201cThere was just a certain amount of ignorance,\u201d Dunham confessed, referencing her privileged white liberal childhood. \u201cI almost wasn\u2019t making a choice because choice implies knowledge. At that point, to be totally frank, I didn\u2019t have enough women of color in my life talking to me about what representation meant to them for me to even understand that my show would be seen and have that kind of power. \u201d To be sure, Dunham says she has learned from her mistakes and promises never to create another show about \u201cfour white girls. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make another show that has four white girls on the poster,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause now, we\u2019ve been very deeply educated about how much representation matters. \u201d The former Hillary Clinton campaign spokeswoman has been busy since failing to fulfill her promise to move to Canada if Donald Trump won the election. After wishing, last month, that she had an abortion, Dunham gave a \u201csizable donation to abortion funds\u201d and Planned Parenthood. During the weekend, Dunham got naked, jumped in a tub of water, and took to Twitter to encourage her followers to sign up for Obamacare before the January 31 enrollment deadline: Inspired by @captdope, here\u2019s a commercial for HEALTH INSURANCE. https:  .  \u2014   get what\u2019s yours #pullthisad \ud83d\ude4f pic. twitter.   \u2014   Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) January 28, 2017,  Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.'"}, "time": 1742563130.979676}
