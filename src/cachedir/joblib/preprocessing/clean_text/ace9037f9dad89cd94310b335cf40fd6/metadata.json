Trump claimed credit on Thursday night for persuading Ford to keep an automaking plant in Kentucky rather than moving it to Mexico. The only wrinkle: Ford was not actually planning to move the plant. Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter shortly after 9 p. m. that Ford\u2019s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr. had just told him that Ford \u201cwill be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky  \u2014   no Mexico. \u201d Minutes later, Mr. Trump wrote in a second post: \u201cI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\u201d Mr. Trump won 62. 5 percent of the state\u2019s popular vote in the presidential election. During the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico, and he threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on vehicles made there. Ford makes the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Louisville. Last week, Ford said it planned to move production of the vehicle elsewhere. On Thursday night, after Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter messages, the company said that Mexico had been the intended destination and that it would now keep MKC production in Kentucky. But Ford had not planned to close the Louisville factory. Instead, it had planned to expand production of another vehicle made in Louisville, the Ford Escape. And the change had not been expected to result in any job losses. \u201cWhatever happens in Louisville, it will not lose employment,\u201d Jimmy Settles, a union official, told The Detroit Free Press. \u201cThey cannot make enough Escapes. \u201d Now, thanks to Mr. Trump, the plant will make fewer Escapes  \u2014   and more MKCs. \u201cWe are encouraged that   Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U. S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\u201d Ford said in a statement.'"}, "time": 1742561844.0627449}
