We have removed one   regulation after another  \u2014   they\u2019re not pretty and they\u2019re going. And believe me, we are just getting started on regulations. They\u2019re gone. On Thursday, the House voted to repeal one of the worst   laws of all. It\u2019s called ObamaCare, perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it. Everywhere we look, ObamaCare is collapsing. The House Bill is a plan that will save Americans from this disaster, and replace it with more choices, and more freedom for American families. Most importantly, it will be great healthcare, and your premiums will come down, and your deductibles will come down. So you\u2019ll have better healthcare at a lower cost. And now, I\u2019m calling on the Senate to take action. Repealing and replacing ObamaCare will be a big, big win for the American People. Last week, my economic team outlined another step in our economic renewal: a massive tax cut to bring jobs and prosperity back to the USA. We pay the highest taxes anywhere in the world. No country is higher, and we\u2019re bringing them down  \u2014  and I mean way down. I am proposing \u2014  actually the single largest tax cut \u2014  in American history. Our tax relief will be focused on the Middle Class, including   relief for low and   parents raising children. As we provide tax relief to working families, we must also stop crippling American Industry. Right now, America\u2019s businesses are taxed at the single highest rate in the developed world. This is a   economic wound that sends jobs to other countries. And believe me, before I got here, they were fleeing fast, but we\u2019ve stopped it. We want to turn our country into a jobs machine \u2014  a jobs magnet, something that really works again. We want America to be the best place in the world to hire, grow, invest, and start a   beautiful business. And that is why under our plan, we are cutting the business tax rate all the way down to 15 percent, bringing thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores. Today\u2019s high taxes on American Business are a gift to the foreign countries taking our jobs, factories, and wealth \u2014  and we\u2019re not going to allow it any longer. Along with our historic tax cut we are proposing dramatic tax simplification. American taxpayers spend billions of hours each year complying with our archaic tax laws, reducing economic productivity and job creation. The complexity of the tax code also disadvantages small businesses and   companies who can\u2019t afford to hire an army of lawyers, and that\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s an army of lawyers, and lobbyists, or accountants. Other people can do it, you can\u2019t, and it\u2019s not fair to ask you to even think about it. That is why we are cleaning up the code, streamlining deductions, and eliminating many special interest tax breaks that largely benefit only the wealthy. Just weeks ago, millions of Americans filed their taxes on Tax Day \u2014  they were reminded again how much they give to Washington. We believe every day Americans know better how to spend their own money than the federal bureaucracy, and we want to help them keep as much of that   money as we can. Tax reform, along with regulatory relief and fair trade deals \u2014  and we\u2019re going to make them fair \u2014  but even really good again for our country, and for our workers. All of this will usher in a new era of prosperity in America  \u2014   and bring wealth, hope, and opportunity to those communities that need it the most. Together, we are going to fight for every last American job. And we are going to fight for great, great trade deals that are so good for our workers, and so good for our families. Thank you, God Bless You, and God Bless America. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742563337.5732594}
