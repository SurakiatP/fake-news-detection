Print \\nA Hillary Clinton-supporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a $20,000 donation funneled through a Belize bank to use in this year\u2019s presidential election campaign \u2013 until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Project Veritas Action. \\nSuddenly, the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donation\u2019s overseas origin and decided to return it. \\nThat\u2019s one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by O\u2019Keefe called \u201cRigging the Election.\u201d \\nO\u2019Keefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with Bob Creamer, who was a staffer at Americans United for Change, a group supporting Clinton for president, until the videos started appearing last week. \\nHe said Creamer, who boasted of working directly for the Clinton campaign, directed that the $20,000 donation go to AUFC \u201cto disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops.\u201d \\nO\u2019Keefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves. \\nCreamer was clear about his ties to Clinton, stating, \u201cEvery morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters.\u201d \\nSign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump\u2019s call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! \\nProject Veritas\u2019 first video explained how the Clinton campaign uses \u201chidden connections\u201d to incite violence at Donald Trump rallies. Its second video showed plans for step-by-step voter fraud and the third exposed \u201cprohibited communications\u201d between Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, \u201cthe DNC and the nonprofit Americans United for Change.\u201d \\nThe fourth video \u201cbreaks down the process of the long-term investigation.\u201d It comes after Creamer\u2019s announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. \\nO\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas Action have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. \\nAmong the revelations in the latest video was Creamer was boasting of his close links to President Obama. \\n\u201cOh, Barack Obama\u2019s was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good, too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a pro, I\u2019ve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago.\u201d \\nWhen asked whether a potential donor could meet Obama, Creamer said: \u201cOK, you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in 98 days, 97. I was just at an event with him in Chicago, Friday of last week, he is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the \u2026 the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.\u201d \\nExplained Project Veritas: \u201cThe more that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get. Project Veritas Action\u2019s $20,000 investment paid off. The story was solid. Robert Creamer, Scott Foval, Jenna Price from the DNC, Brad Woodhouse from AUFC, Cesar Vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous PVA videos.\u201d \\nIn the first video, Foval, a Democratic operative, boasted of what he called \u201cconflict engagement,\u201d or sending protesters to disrupt Trump events. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting anarchy here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he needs to understand that we\u2019re starting anarchy.\u201d \\nIn the second video, Creamer explained Clinton\u2019s direct control over those disruption operations. \\n\u201cIn the end it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future President of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground, so by god we would get ducks on the ground,\u201d Creamer said. \\nCreamer, the husband of Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, has starred in several of the undercover videos. \\nHere\u2019s the third: \\nThat video also revealed a direct conflict between what Creamer was confirming \u2013 Clinton\u2019s active involvement in such decisions and campaigns \u2013 and the claim of her campaign manager, Robby Mook. \\nMook told CNN over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and Clinton. \\nSign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump\u2019s call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! \\n\u201cThese individuals no longer have a relationship with the DNC,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never had a relationship with the Clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened I think in February of last year. \\n\u201cThey did not have a contract with the DNC until June. But putting all that aside, this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign, it is edited so we don\u2019t know what the full context is. And there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever \u2026 that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the DNC.\u201d \\nHis comments: \\nAfter confirming it was Clinton or \u201cwanted ducks on the ground,\u201d Creamer warned undercover Project Veritas journalists, \u201cDon\u2019t repeat that to anybody.\u201d \\nCreamer ran Democracy Partners, a consulting company with ties to Clinton. \\nHe has been to the White House 342 times while Obama has been president, including 47 meetings directly with Obama. \\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s organization reported that the coordination between the campaign, the DNC and the Americans United for Change \u201csmacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures.\u201d \\nLast week , Project Veritas filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission asking for an investigation into the Clinton campaign\u2019s \u201ccriminal conspiracy.\u201d \\nThe filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which Democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means, such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally. \\nThe video have resulted already in two Democratic operatives losing their jobs. \\nEditor\u2019s Note: Be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos. \\nOne is Scott Foval, who had worked for People for the American Way, a George Soros-funded group, and more recently with Americans United for Change. \\nIn the video, he said: \u201cYou know what? We\u2019ve been busing people in to deal with you f\u2014ing a\u2014\u2013es for 50 years, and we\u2019re not going to stop now.\u201d \\nAlso, he said he and his agents are \u201cstarting anarchy\u201d by creating \u201cconflict engagement \u2026 in the lines at Trump rallies.\u201d \\nAlso out of work is Creamer. \\nSee the second video: \\nTalk-radio icon Rush Limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome. \\n\u201cEvery Trump rally would feature none of this [violence] unless the Democrats were paying for it. I think it\u2019s a big deal, folks. The media is complicit. They know who these people are. \u2026 They\u2019re in on it. They\u2019re part of the game. \u2026 None of it\u2019s organic. None of it\u2019s natural. None of it\u2019s real. Every bit of it is bought and paid for. \\n\u201c[Democrats] can\u2019t leave elections to chance because they know that, despite the way it may look, the majority of Americans would not support them if they knew who they are.\u201d \\nThe first video:'"}, "time": 1742628464.557988}
