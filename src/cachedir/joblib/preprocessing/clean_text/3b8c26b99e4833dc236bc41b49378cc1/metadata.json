That\u2019s absurd. \u201d  During a discussion with economist Stephen Moore, Reich said, \u201cSteve Moore, you said a moment ago that, actually, a lot of people are suffering a hardship under Obamacare, under the Affordable Care Act. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I mean, 20 million people, or 24 million, if you believe the Congressional Budget Office, would have lost their health insurance because of the former Republican plan. We don\u2019t know how many millions are going to lose their health insurance now. Those subsidies, by the way, kept up with increases in premiums. Health insurance costs are going up all over the country, even for people who are not in Obamacare. That is a problem, but it\u2019s a problem that is a generic problem right now. We\u2019ve to get control of those health insurance costs. But how can you possibly say that Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, actually was cruel or a burden to people? That\u2019s absurd. \u201d Reich later added that Obamacare has flaws, but that it can be fixed. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564319.49348}
