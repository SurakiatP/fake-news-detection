Lynch said she would accept the recommendations of prosecutors and the F. B. I. about whether to bring charges against Hillary Clinton over her private email server. Ms. Lynch\u2019s statement came after she was criticized for meeting with Bill Clinton at an airport this week. She said the encounter was unplanned and they did not talk about the case. But Republicans and some Democrats said it raised questions about the integrity of the email investigation, which hangs over the presidential election. _____ 2. What should we expect from the Republican convention, just two weeks away? It won\u2019t be \u201cboring\u201d like previous ones, pledged Donald J. Trump, who also said he won\u2019t speak every night. Beyond that, the usually polished and choreographed affair is in flux. But if Mr. Trump\u2019s comments at a Thursday event were any indication  \u2014   he suggested that a plane overhead was a Mexican aircraft ready for an \u201cattack\u201d  \u2014   his     style may be hard to avoid, even if he\u2019s planning to hew more closely to a script. _____ 3. The number of civilians killed by U. S. airstrikes outside conventional war zones since 2009 is between 64 and 116 people, the Obama administration said Friday. The number comes from 473 strikes that took place between Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009 and the end of 2015, and it is much lower than estimates from independent watchdogs. Mr. Obama also issued an executive order requiring the government to disclose the number of civilian deaths annually. Above, a protest against drone strikes in Pakistan. _____ 4. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for an attack in which armed men took hostages in a restaurant in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. A kitchen worker said eight to 10 men entered the restaurant  \u2014   where about 20 foreigners were dining  \u2014   opened fire and detonated several explosives. Two police officers were killed in the standoff. The State Department said all its American employees there were safe. _____ 5. If you\u2019re carrying dollars in your wallet, they\u2019re worth more than they were last week  \u2014   but that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has investors dumping the pound and the euro, and turning to American currency instead. But that makes U. S. imports more expensive on the global market, complicating the American economy\u2019s already fragile expansion. _____ 6. Austria will have a   on its presidential election, in which a   candidate, Norbert Hofer, above left, narrowly lost to Alexander Van der Bellen of the Green Party in May. The situation reflects the wider turmoil in Europe over immigration, which was also a prominent issue in Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Mr. Hofer and his party, the   Freedom Party, had campaigned heavily on the migrant issue. _____ 7. Tighter security at airports doesn\u2019t necessarily make us safer  \u2014   as seen in the attacks on Tuesday at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport, where three suicide bombers killed 44 people and wounded hundreds of others. Vehicle screenings begin a mile from the airport and people go through security before they enter the terminal, which is where the attackers were initially turned away, but later returned with guns. Here\u2019s a look at how a typical U. S. airport compares with those in Istanbul and other places. _____ 8. A Mississippi law that would have protected people who object to   marriages on religious grounds was struck down by a federal judge minutes before it was to take effect. The judge, Carlton W. Reeves, called it \u201ca vehicle for   discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. \u201d Some state leaders pledged to appeal, though the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general expressed reservations. _____ 9. Yuliya Stepanova, above, a Russian    athlete who blew the whistle on doping and got other athletes from her country barred, will be among the few from her nation, if any, who can compete at the Olympic Games in Rio. The sport\u2019s governing body ruled that she can compete, and if Olympic officials agree, it\u2019s still an open question whether she would represent Russia  \u2014   which she fled two years ago  \u2014   or be a neutral athlete. _____ 10. Gay Talese, above, the storied journalist and author, is defending his coming book, \u201cThe Voyeur\u2019s Motel,\u201d after an article raised questions about key facts. It\u2019s a reversal of his initial response to the discrepancies, in which he called the book\u2019s credibility \u201cdown the toilet. \u201d The issue relates to the veracity of the central character, who said he had spied on his motel guests for years. _____ 11. Mosha, a    elephant in Thailand, got her ninth artificial leg this week. She lost her leg when she stepped on a land mine at just 7 months old in a part of Myanmar where rebels have been fighting the government for decades. She\u2019s among more than a dozen elephants who have been wounded by land mines in the region. _____ 12. Ah, the Fourth of July. It\u2019s a time to celebrate our nation\u2019s independence, perhaps gathering with family and friends for a barbecue before admiring fireworks at dusk. But there\u2019s an unpleasant side to the holiday: a history of ghastly injuries and, sometimes, death  \u2014   generally because of those same fireworks. So have a great holiday weekend and, please, be safe! _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
