Meghan Aguilar says investigators were called to the scene before dawn Wednesday. \\nBy mid-morning, an LAPD spokesperson at the scene told FOX411 the Chamber of Commerce was sending out a crew in the hopes of getting the star repaired as soon as possible. \\n\u201cInvestigators are looking at [a] felony vandalism [charge] because of the value which the Chamber of Commerce has placed [on the star] at $2,500\u2026\u201d the spokesperson told us. \u201cAs soon as investigators can positively identify the suspect, which they are very sure they can do\u2026 they will go ahead and make a decision whether they want to arrest that suspect or seek a warrant.\u201d \\nFox411 spoke with a worker from Top End Construction who told them that the damage done to Trump\u2019s star was \u201cprobably the worst I have seen.\u201d \\nA man named Jamie Otis has taken responsibility for the destruction, according to Deadline Hollywood, which posted a video of the man taking a pickax to Trump\u2019s star. \\nAccording to Deadline, Otis planned to auction off the star and give the money to the 11 women who have come forward with groping allegations against Trump just weeks before the presidential election. \\nTrump has denied the groping allegations and it\u2019s painfully obvious that they are almost assuredly politically motivated . As far as what the women get out of it, some may be politically motivated themselves and others have had their ulterior motives \u2014 money , fame, payback because Trump didn\u2019t go to their restaurant, etc. \u2014 exposed. \\nHollywood Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Leron Gubler made it clear that his organization \u201cintends to prosecute to the full extent of the law,\u201d whoever is found to be responsible for the damage.\u201d \\n\u201cThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees,\u201d Gubler stated. \u201cWhen people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742562158.5482373}
