Trump\u2019s chaotic presidential campaign. On Friday, the chaos devoured him. Weeks of sliding poll numbers and false starts had sapped Mr. Manafort\u2019s credibility inside the campaign. A cooling relationship with Mr. Trump  \u2014   who had taken to calling Mr. Manafort \u201clow energy,\u201d the epithet he once used to mock a former rival, Jeb Bush  \u2014   turned hot last weekend when the candidate erupted, blaming Mr. Manafort for a damaging newspaper article detailing the campaign\u2019s internal travails, according to three people briefed on the episode. Then a wave of reports about Mr. Manafort\u2019s own business dealings with   leaders in Ukraine, involving allegations of millions of dollars in cash payments and secret lobbying efforts in the United States, threw a spotlight on a glaring vulnerability for Mr. Trump: his admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. By Friday morning, Mr. Manafort\u2019s predictions to confidants that he might not be able to survive in his post had come true. \u201cThis morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cI am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today. \u201d In fact, Mr. Manafort did not go voluntarily. \u201cMy father just didn\u2019t want to have the distraction looming over the campaign,\u201d Eric Trump, the candidate\u2019s second son, explained in a Fox News interview. In a twist, Mr. Manafort\u2019s ouster came after a week in which Mr. Trump had taken several steps toward the kind of normalized candidacy that Mr. Manafort had been striving for: The Republican nominee gave three speeches in which he generally stuck to a script he mostly attacked Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, while refraining from berating other Republicans and, on Friday, he began running his first television advertisements. The timing of Mr. Manafort\u2019s departure largely overshadowed the news Thursday night when the candidate, who has long spurned apologies, announced at a rally that he actually regretted some of the more offensive things he has said  \u2014   though without specifying which. And on Friday, Mr. Trump toured   areas of Baton Rouge, La. even as his aides were confirming Mr. Manafort\u2019s exit. Mr. Manafort, 67, who had managed national Republican conventions in the past, was hired in late March, as Mr. Trump was facing a pitched battle to amass the number of delegates needed to capture the party\u2019s nomination. He was seen as a peer to Mr. Trump, 70, and as someone whose advice Mr. Trump might heed. He ended up taking the helm of the campaign when Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s previous campaign manager, was fired after repeatedly clashing with the candidate\u2019s children. Mr. Manafort helped defeat the \u201cnever Trump\u201d movement within the Republican Party, opened lines of communication with party leaders in Washington and crushed a brief but noisy delegate uprising on the floor of the Republican convention in Cleveland on its first day. He also successfully pushed for the selection of Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate. But Mr. Trump never developed the sort of chemistry or comfort level with Mr. Manafort that he had with Mr. Lewandowski, campaign aides said. Mr. Trump has continued to seek out the advice of Mr. Lewandowski, who remains a fierce rival of Mr. Manafort. Nor did Mr. Trump ever quite buy into what Mr. Manafort was selling. Just as Mr. Trump has resisted behaving like a traditional presidential candidate, he has also felt little need to construct the sort of hierarchical organization typical of a campaign for the White House. This is in part, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers say, because he relies on his instincts and the counsel of his family. But it is also because he simply prefers to improvise, unconstrained by convention or by a chain of command. A change in the leadership of his campaign may not stop Mr. Trump from making abrupt decisions based on news coverage, playing advisers off one another and following the guidance of whoever may be traveling with him or has just spoken to him on the phone. But what Mr. Trump loses in Mr. Manafort is somebody who has had decades of experience in campaigns and relationships in the party that made him a useful ambassador for a candidate who lacks both, and is given to angering fellow Republicans. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter on Friday that Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort\u2019s deputy, would leave New York for Washington, where he would serve as \u201cthe campaign\u2019s liaison to the R. N. C. \u201d But it remains to be seen who will step into Mr. Manafort\u2019s role of chief strategist for the final 11 weeks until Election Day. Mr. Manafort\u2019s exit came as Mr. Trump had been trying to reboot his campaign after a disastrous stretch in which he committed a series of   wounds  \u2014   belittling the mother of a Muslim soldier who was killed in Iraq and threatening to withhold an endorsement from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a fellow Republican. Aides have tried a range of efforts to rein in Mr. Trump\u2019s impulses. But they have been unsuccessful in taming his propensity to respond sharply to media coverage of his campaign. It was an article in The New York Times last weekend  \u2014   about frequent but frustrated efforts by Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers to curtail his pugilistic instincts  \u2014   that set off the series of events leading to Mr. Manafort\u2019s departure. On Saturday, Mr. Trump raged at Mr. Manafort, holding him responsible for the article, according to people familiar with the episode. On Sunday, Mr. Trump hastily convened a meeting of paid and unpaid advisers including the pollster Kellyanne Conway Roger Ailes, the ousted Fox News chairman and Stephen K. Bannon, the chairman of Breitbart News, a conservative website. Mr. Manafort was present for part of the meeting. Mr. Ailes urged Mr. Trump to reconfigure the campaign\u2019s leadership, according to a Republican briefed on the meeting. A former Republican strategist and ad man who was friends with Mr. Trump long before his ouster, Mr. Ailes had reviewed some of the initial television commercials Mr. Manafort had overseen and told Mr. Trump in blunt terms that they were lackluster. Only on Tuesday was Mr. Manafort informed of the campaign\u2019s impending   to be announced the next day: Ms. Conway would become campaign manager, and Mr. Bannon would become the campaign\u2019s chief executive, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussion. At the same time, the new accounts of Mr. Manafort\u2019s ties to Ukraine quickly eroded the support that he had from Mr. Trump\u2019s family during his earlier battles with Mr. Lewandowski. According to people briefed on the matter, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s    expressed increasing concern after a  Times article published on Sunday about allegations of cash payments made to Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm for his work on behalf of his main client, Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukranian president, who is an ally of Mr. Putin. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has repeatedly sought to yoke Mr. Trump to Mr. Putin, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s praise for the Russian leader. And the avalanche of stories about his work for   entities in Ukraine were becoming untenable for the campaign, according to people briefed on the discussions. \u201cThe easiest way for Trump to sidestep the whole Ukraine story is for Manafort not to be there,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who has become a counselor to Mr. Trump. In North Carolina on Thursday, Mr. Trump was informed of the newest such report: an Associated Press article that, citing emails, showed that Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm had orchestrated a   lobbying campaign in Washington without registering as a foreign agent. That was enough, according to people briefed on the calls, for Mr. Trump to call Mr. Bannon and Ms. Conway. He had the same message for each: It was time for Mr. Manafort to go.'"}, "time": 1742628479.9576526}
