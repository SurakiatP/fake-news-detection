The Justice Department\u2019s criminal investigation into Takata\u2019s   airbags has so far painted automakers as unwitting victims duped by a rogue supplier that manipulated safety data to hide a deadly defect, linked to at least 11 deaths and over 100 injuries in the United States. But the fresh allegations against Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota, made as part of a   lawsuit in Florida and based on company documents, point to a far deeper involvement by automakers that used Takata\u2019s defective airbags for years. Honda vehemently denied the new allegations on Monday. The three other automakers either declined to comment or said a response would come through legal channels. Last summer, The New York Times reported indications that automakers, rather than being the victims of Takata\u2019s missteps, had pressed their suppliers to put cost before all else. That report focused on General Motors, which is not named in the Florida case, though plaintiff lawyers said they were preparing to take action against the company. The defect has prompted the nation\u2019s largest automotive recall ever, affecting nearly 70 million airbags in 42 million vehicles. The plaintiffs\u2019 filing came hours before Takata pleaded guilty, under a deal announced last month, to charges of wire fraud for providing the false data, a rare outcome for businesses accused of wrongdoing. Federal prosecutors also said last month that they had charged three Takata executives with fabricating test data and fined the Tokyo company $1 billion. \u201cI deeply regret the circumstances that resulted in the agreement today,\u201d Yoichiro Nomura, Takata\u2019s chief executive, said at the federal court hearing in Detroit. The company\u2019s actions were \u201ccompletely unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cTakata is fully committed to ensuring such conduct never happens again,\u201d he added. The allegations in the Florida case came in response to a court document filed by the automakers last week that pointed to Takata\u2019s plea deal to argue that the supplier alone was culpable. But the plaintiffs, who could gain from suing the   automakers alongside Takata, argue that the automakers were more deeply involved in the handling of the defect. The fines and costs associated with the scandal have also taken a heavy financial toll on Takata, and it has been searching for a financial lifeline  \u2014   possibly in the form of a white knight that would effectively take it over. One of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, Kevin R. Dean, filed an objection to Takata\u2019s plea deal on Monday in Detroit, arguing that the automakers were accomplices in the  . He urged the judge to reject the agreement and for the Justice Department to further investigate the automakers\u2019 role. The plaintiffs have taken particular issue with the amount set aside for victims in Takata\u2019s plea  \u2014   a total of $125 million. In contrast, the automakers will have recourse to draw on an $850 million fund to offset continuing recall costs. Judge George Caram Steeh dismissed Mr. Dean\u2019s objections, saying that Takata\u2019s plea deal was in the best interest of the victims. He said any further action against the automakers should be pursued in civil court, and approved the plea deal as is. Randi Johnston, 26, of Farmington, Utah  \u2014   who was injured in September 2015 when the airbag in her 2003 Honda Civic ruptured and metal shards struck her throat  \u2014   attended the hearing and said afterward that she was shocked by the judge\u2019s decision. The shards severed most of her vocal cords, leaving her able to speak only in a whisper. \u201cI really don\u2019t have any words right now,\u201d said Ms. Johnston, a plaintiff in the Florida   case. The filing by the plaintiffs says emails and internal documents turned over by Honda show that in 1999 and 2000, the automaker was intimately involved in developing a problematic propellant, or explosive, used in Takata\u2019s airbags. The propellant is housed in a steel container called the inflater, which in the Takata case can rupture, shooting metal fragments toward the car\u2019s driver or passengers. That propellant, based on a volatile compound, raised concerns internally at Takata at the time, and long plagued the company\u2019s engineers. During testing of Takata\u2019s inflaters in 1999 and 2000 at Honda\u2019s own facilities, at least two inflaters ruptured, according to the filing. Still, Honda pushed a particularly problematic configuration of the propellant over Takata\u2019s objections, the filing said. Honda chose Takata\u2019s airbags because of their relative \u201cinexpensiveness,\u201d the filing quoted Honda documents as saying. The first recalls of Takata\u2019s airbags did not take place until almost a decade later, when Honda recalled 4, 000 vehicles in 2008. The Times has reported that Honda and Takata became aware in 2004 of an airbag explosion in a Honda Accord in Alabama that shot out metal fragments and injured the car\u2019s driver. But the two companies deemed it \u201can anomaly\u201d and did not issue a recall or seek the involvement of federal safety regulators. On Monday, Honda strongly y denied the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 filing. When it installed Takata\u2019s airbags, it said in a statement, \u201cHonda reasonably believed, based on extensive test results provided by Takata, that they were safe. \u201d Honda said it believed it reacted \u201cpromptly and appropriately\u201d in handling known airbag defects. It also said Takata\u2019s airbags had not necessarily been cheaper than those of its competitors. \u201cSometimes they were more expensive, sometimes less,\u201d the carmaker said. The filing also cites internal documents from Ford, Nissan and Toyota indicating that cost considerations influenced the automakers\u2019 decision to adopt Takata\u2019s airbags in the early 2000s, despite safety concerns. Toyota used Takata\u2019s airbags \u201cprimarily\u201d for cost reasons, even though the automaker had \u201clarge quality concerns\u201d about Takata and considered the supplier\u2019s quality performance \u201cunacceptable,\u201d the filing said. In 2003, a Takata inflater ruptured at a Toyota facility during testing, the court filing said. In 2005, Nissan began investigating the use of adding a drying agent to Takata\u2019s airbag inflaters out of concern that exposure to moisture made the propellant particularly unstable, the filing says. Takata engineers had long known that its explosive was sensitive to moisture and adopted it despite internal concerns over its safety. Although patents show that its engineers have long struggled to tame the propellant, the company still maintains that the explosive can be stabilized to withstand moist conditions. Ford chose Takata\u2019s inflaters over the objections of the automaker\u2019s own inflater expert, who opposed the use of Takata\u2019s propellant because of its instability and sensitivity to moisture, the filing said. Ford overrode those objections because it thought Takata was the only supplier that could provide the large number of inflaters Ford needed, the filing says. The filing says that Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota were also aware of instances of ruptures years before any recalls. It also mentions the German carmaker BMW and points to circumstantial evidence that BMW was similarly involved in what federal prosecutors, in their criminal complaint and in announcing the Takata   agreement, have called a  . But BMW has so far refused to submit documents in the case, the filing says. Representatives of Nissan and BMW said the companies could not comment on active cases. A Toyota representative also declined to comment. A Ford spokeswoman said the automaker would respond through appropriate legal channels.'"}, "time": 1742561895.7178247}
