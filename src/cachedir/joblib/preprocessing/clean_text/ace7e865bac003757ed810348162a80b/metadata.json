On Thursday, federal regulators announced a $5 million settlement with Jon S. Corzine, who ran MF Global when it collapsed into bankruptcy in 2011 and lost more than $1 billion in customer money. The settlement, reached unanimously at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the waning days of the Obama administration and approved by a federal judge this week, caps a   spectacle that derailed Mr. Corzine\u2019s career and spurred a number of congressional, criminal and regulatory investigations. The regulatory case arose in 2013, when the commodities agency sued Mr. Corzine, a Democratic former New Jersey senator and governor, saying he had failed to \u201cdiligently supervise\u201d the firm as it jeopardized the clients\u2019 accounts. The agency did not directly link Mr. Corzine, 70, to the missing money, but it did accuse a   employee in Chicago, Edith O\u2019Brien, of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the misuse of customer money, saying she allowed it to be used to plug holes in MF Global\u2019s own accounts. To resolve the case, Mr. Corzine has agreed to pay the $5 million penalty out of his own pocket. While the sum is manageable for someone who reaped many millions of dollars as a top Goldman Sachs executive before pursuing a career in politics, it is an unusual step. In other federal cases involving Wall Street, insurance money often covers settlement amounts, sparing the executives themselves. While Mr. Corzine was willing to settle the case, Ms. O\u2019Brien nearly took it to trial. But in recent weeks she, too, agreed to settle, striking a deal that has imposed a $500, 000 penalty and an   prohibition on her associating with a futures broker like MF Global. Mr. Corzine agreed to a harsher undertaking  \u2014   accepting a lifetime prohibition from leading a futures broker or registering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In effect, that means he will not personally trade other people\u2019s money in the futures industry, except for smaller trades under certain threshold limits. Mr. Corzine, in theory, could still operate a hedge fund that does futures trading, and he could trade for his own account. The settlement also does not prevent him from trading in other markets. \u201cThis resolution demonstrates the importance that the commission attaches to customer protection, which has long been a hallmark of our mission,\u201d Aitan Goelman, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission enforcement division, said in a statement announcing the settlement. The settlements, the contours of which were reported by The New York Times in October, bring a   close to the MF Global ordeal. The criminal investigations ended with the conclusion that MF Global employees did not intentionally break the law. Just last year, Mr. Corzine settled much of the private MF Global litigation. And a trustee has long recovered the missing customer money (much of it wound up at MF Global\u2019s banks and clearinghouses) and made whole the farmers and hedge funds whose accounts were raided in the firm\u2019s final days. In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Corzine said, \u201cAs the C. E. O. of MF Global in 2011, I have accepted responsibility for its failure, and I deeply regret the impact it had on customers, employees, shareholders and others. \u201d He added: \u201cI remain gratified that several years ago all customer money was recovered and returned to MF Global customers. \u201d His lawyer, Andrew J. Levander, said: \u201cMr. Corzine has given more than 10 days of testimony under oath, and these matters have been investigated exhaustively by two U. S. attorney\u2019s offices, the F. B. I. the S. E. C. the C. F. T. C. Finra and Congress. \u201d (Finra is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.) And yet, Mr. Levander said, \u201cNone of these investigations have led to allegations that Mr. Corzine engaged in any kind of intentional misconduct or fraud, or that he was at any time not truthful in his many hours of testimony. \u201d The case also concludes a   political challenge for the commodities agency, which came under fire for not preventing a breach of customer money at a firm it regulated. Compounding the pressure, Mr. Corzine was a sensitive target, a prominent Democrat who has been a confidant of leaders in Washington and on Wall Street. Against that backdrop, the agency extracted the $5 million payout from Mr. Corzine, a sum far greater than what it could have expected to win if he had been found liable at trial. During negotiations with Mr. Corzine last year, the commission also strengthened aspects of the deal after some of the agency\u2019s commissioners questioned it, The New York Times reported at the time. The case against Mr. Corzine was among the agency\u2019s biggest enforcement actions in the Obama administration. And after MF Global\u2019s demise, on Halloween in 2011, the commodities agency used the episode to tighten the rules for protecting customer money. The disappearance of the money from MF Global unnerved the futures industry and raised broader concerns about the safety of customer funds across Wall Street. Further review showed that MF Global\u2019s financial straits left it vulnerable to a breach. Mr. Corzine joined MF Global as chief executive and chairman in 2010 after the firm had lost money in each of the previous three years. In hopes of returning the firm to profitability  \u2014   and perhaps transforming it into a miniature Goldman Sachs  \u2014   Mr. Corzine placed a large wager on European sovereign debt at a time when investors feared defaults in the eurozone. Although his bet ultimately would have been profitable for MF Global, and the European bonds paid out for other firms that bought the debt, it was not enough to save the firm from unrelated woes. MF Global\u2019s auditor, for example, made the firm write down the value of a significant future tax benefit, a move that appeared to unnerve MF Global\u2019s investors as well as ratings agencies. And after a series of ratings downgrades, the firm started to unravel. In MF Global\u2019s final days, it overdrew an account at JPMorgan Chase, one of its banks, and scrambled to patch that hole. That is when the improper transfers of customer money accelerated, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s complaint. Minutes after learning of the overdrawn account, Mr. Corzine told Ms. O\u2019Brien that meeting the bank\u2019s demands was \u201cthe most important thing\u201d she could get \u201cdone that day. \u201d Ultimately, in the chaos and confusion of those final days, customer money was transferred to JPMorgan. And yet, Mr. Corzine was not accused of instructing Ms. O\u2019Brien to use customer money for this purpose. According to court records submitted by his lawyers, Mr. Corzine was not told that the firm was at risk of violating the rules until the eve of the bankruptcy, after the breach had happened. In an email, Ms. O\u2019Brien told Mr. Corzine that the transfer to JPMorgan was a \u201chouse wire,\u201d meaning it came from the firm\u2019s accounts. In the years since, Mr. Corzine has visited Central America for a humanitarian project and has traded with his own money. His philanthropic efforts have included working with Covenant House, a nonprofit focused on helping homeless children. \u201cWith this matter resolved,\u201d he said, \u201cI am eager to move forward and plan to spend my time focused on issues that have always been important in my life: my family, community and philanthropic causes, and markets. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563563.4887168}
