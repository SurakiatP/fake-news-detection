You can pin it to a large outside wall, though if you live north of Swindon you\u2019ll need a ladder to examine it. Or just lay it on the floor, the lawn or a nearby public park. \\n\u201cAt that point \u2013 assuming you know where your home town is actually located \u2013 it\u2019s really easy to find all the traitors within your midst who want to hand this country over to Guyana. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re also giving each reader a giant pen so they can score off each traitor\u2019s name as they are being bundled into the back of a van by some soldiers.\u201d \\nThe spokesman added: \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely, traditional way of hunting down communists and homosexuals using a proper British map.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742564282.8561196}
