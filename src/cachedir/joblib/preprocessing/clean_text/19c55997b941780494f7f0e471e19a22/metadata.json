Protester escorted out of rally. Trump to protester: \u201cWere you paid $1,500 to be a thug? Were you paid? You can get him out.\u201d pic.twitter.com/jukUj4yuBH \\n\u2014 Bryan Anderson (@BryanRAnderson) October 26, 2016 \\nTrump\u2019s insulting and racially tinged rhetoric came hours after he was in Charlotte reaching out to the African-American community and promising a \u201cnew deal for black America\u201d if elected president. \\nThe Republican nominee has insulted African-American voters throughout much of the campaign, often calling their communities \u201chell\u201d and claiming they only live in areas riddled with crime and crumbling schools. \\nOf course, in true Trump form, he didn\u2019t just use tasteless rhetoric insulting to the African-American community at his rally. He also took a shot at Syrian refugees. Trump in Kinston, NC: \u201cThe refugee program would leave us with generations of terrorism, radicalism and extremism inside our shores\u201d \\n\u2014 Ashley Killough (@KilloughCNN) October 26, 2016 \\nIf you\u2019re keeping score at home, African Americans who stand up to Trump\u2019s offensive campaign message are \u201cthugs\u201d and Syrian refugees who come to the United States \u2013 in most cases women and children simply seeking a better life \u2013 are terrorists who will do damage to our country for \u201cgenerations.\u201d \\nA man who has such disdain for so many Americans has no business being President of the United States.'"}, "time": 1742561962.2555413}
