They talk about grief, love and hope. And then  \u2014   this being their job  \u2014   they move on to talk about something else. Monday night, as   shows aired their first episodes after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. there was a recurring theme: Talk is not enough anymore. From more freewheeling cable shows to the mainstream broadcasters, the prevailing message was that   hosts had been here so many times, after so many mass murders, the sad comic\u2019s display of apolitical grief response had become shtick. \u201cYou realize that you know what to say,\u201d Stephen Colbert said on CBS, \u201cbecause it\u2019s been said too many times before. \u201d Samantha Bee, the host of \u201cFull Frontal\u201d on TBS, said that she was too angry to deliver some \u201c  words about how we will get through this together, how love wins, how love conquers hate. \u201d She continued: \u201cLove does not win unless we start loving each other enough to fix our [expletive] problems\u201d  \u2014   starting, she argued, with restricting access to guns like the semiautomatic that Omar Mateen used to kill dozens of clubgoers. Ms. Bee\u2019s political comedy has been blistering from the second \u201cFull Frontal\u201d began in February, and taking sides is her mission, much as it was on her alma mater, \u201cThe Daily Show. \u201d (In his own commentary on the terrorist attack, Trevor Noah declared, \u201cAmerica needs to make it a lot harder for people who shouldn\u2019t have guns to get guns. \u201d) What was new was the quaver in Ms. Bee\u2019s voice  \u2014   the barest suggestion that it was all she could do to keep it together even as she lashed the National Rifle Association and politicians who oppose gun regulations. Ms. Bee has been a   punk band of rage, sarcasm and urgency Monday\u2019s show added an acoustic note of heartbreak. Ms. Bee\u2019s   Conan O\u2019Brien, made a bigger departure. Never a particularly political host, he told his audience, \u201cI have really tried very hard over the years not to bore you with what I think. \u201d But on this night, he said, \u201cI simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semiautomatic assault rifle. \u201d Hosts evolve over the years  \u2014   David Letterman became more political in his later seasons  \u2014   and Mr. O\u2019Brien has been at this since 1993. But he also now has the latitude afforded by a smaller cable audience. It\u2019s questionable whether, were he still hosting \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d he would have been able to speak out the same way. Compare the emotional but conventional plea for peace and understanding offered by the current host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d Jimmy Fallon: \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a lesson from all this, a lesson in tolerance. We need to support each other\u2019s differences and worry less about our own opinions. \u201d On CBS\u2019s \u201cLate Show,\u201d Mr. Colbert\u2019s reaction captured his delicate effort over the past year to find a middle ground between the sharp point of view of \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d and the more typical neutrality of late night. His monologue wasn\u2019t as prescriptive as Ms. Bee\u2019s or Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s, but it tiptoed up to the edge of   \u2026     something. Opening behind his desk  \u2014   a departure for his show  \u2014   Mr. Colbert talked about love fighting despair, but with the suggestion that feeling, in itself, wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cLove the families and the victims and the people of Orlando, but let\u2019s remember that love is a verb. And to love means to do something. \u201d Mr. Colbert was saying not that love is itself an action, but that love requires acts to mean anything. It was an idea that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a church group, and indeed, the former Sunday school teacher seemed to be trying to bring that experience to late night. Not to punt on the moral question or preach about it, but to think through a problem with his congregation. He continued that approach with his first guest, Fox News\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly, who had been scheduled before the attack. The conservative host was more eager to talk about the   angle of the killings, whereas it became clear that for Mr. Colbert, \u201cdo something\u201d meant, in part, getting powerful guns off the streets. Conservatives will notice, correctly, that late night was not exactly an N. R. A.  zone. In his \u201cA Closer Look\u201d segment, Seth Meyers touted a Harvard study that linked more gun availability to more gun deaths. \u201cWhich should be obvious,\u201d Mr. Meyers continued. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying, where there\u2019s more white people, there\u2019s more brunch. \u201d But the \u201cLate Show\u201d exchange was strikingly civil. Mr. O\u2019Reilly signaled openness to restrict some guns Mr. Colbert gently shushed his less conservative audience when it grumbled at his guest: \u201cListen to what he has to say, please. \u201d Trying to come to some mutual understanding about guns and terrorism at any time, let alone in an election year, seems quaint and quixotic. And it symbolizes the tough job Mr. Colbert has had in synthesizing the Comedy Central and CBS audiences on his new show. He might be too political for the car   crowd, too accommodating for partisans who want viral clips of their enemies being \u201ctotally destroyed. \u201d Whether he succeeds or not, there was a growing, exhausted sense Monday that the usual     approach wasn\u2019t cutting it. As Mr. O\u2019Brien put it: \u201cIt\u2019s time to grow up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562290.2432983}
