S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would end the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat warned on Saturday. [\u201cWe believe that moving the U. S. embassy to Jerusalem would mean the end of the peace process,\u201d said Erekat, who is also   of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) during a World Economic Forum meeting at the Dead Sea in Jordan on Saturday.  Erekat\u2019s warning is the latest of a series of similar declarations from Arab and Muslim leaders. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is slated to meet with Trump in Bethlehem on Tuesday, said in January that if Trump moves the embassy, it will \u201cdestroy the peace process. \u201d Abbas\u2019 senior aide and the PA\u2019s supreme Sharia judge Mahmoud   stated that an embassy transfer would be a \u201cdeclaration of war. \u201d And earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Erdogan said it would be \u201cextremely  \u201d for Trump to move the embassy. Erekat said a Palestinian state without eastern Jerusalem as its capital would have \u201cno meaning. \u201d He also expressed his hope that \u201cPresident Trump would give us a chance. \u201d \u201cHe said   \u2026     he will not impose solutions on us or on the Israelis,\u201d Erekat said. \u201c(But) the fact that he is going to move the embassy is imposition, is dictation. \u201d Erekat also met with opposition member Tzipi Livni (Zionist Union)  \u2014   his counterpart in   negotiations  \u2014   and the two expressed their hope that Trump would be successful in his efforts to jumpstart the moribund peace process. The new U. S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, welcomed the notion of an embassy relocation but said the decision was ultimately Trump\u2019s. The president\u2019s   visit to Israel will coincide with Jerusalem Day, marking the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem since the 1967 defensive war and speculation has been rife that the president will use the opportunity to announce an embassy relocation. However, on Wednesday a senior administration official told the Times of Israel that the decision \u201cwouldn\u2019t be immediate\u201d and \u201ca final decision hadn\u2019t been made. \u201d Earlier in the day, a White House official told Bloomberg that considering the upcoming attempts to restart the peace talks, moving the embassy would be  . \u201cWe don\u2019t think it would be wise to do it at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear what our position is and what we would like to see done, but we\u2019re not looking to provoke anyone when everyone\u2019s playing really nice. \u201d A waiver for the congressional mandate on an embassy transfer has been signed every six months by consecutive U. S. presidents since 1995. The next date for that waiver is June 1.'"}, "time": 1742628499.4209547}
