In the previous episode , the Spirit of Liberalism Past abruptly vanished, and Outis found himself face to face with someone else. \u201cWhat a cute bunny,\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cBut why is she wearing a police uniform?\u201d She stared at me with her big blue eyes and confidently held out her paw. Bemused, I took it. She softly shook my hand. \u201cHopps, Judy Hopps,\u201d she announced. \u201cOutis Philalithopoulos,\u201d I responded slowly. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d \u201cI am the Spirit of Liberalism Present!\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d I replied. \u201cHave you seen my movie?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m dead,\u201d I confessed. \u201cSo?\u201d she responded undeterred. \u201cSo I haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d Her face fell. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. Then she brightened again. \u201cYou just have to see it. The New York Times said it was \u2018irresistible.\u2019 And \u2018delightful.\u2019 And \u2018thought-provoking.\u2019 Not to mention \u2018full of savvy jokes.\u2019 Rolling Stone said that it might be \u2018the most subversive movie of the year.\u2019\u201d \u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d I said. \u201c And it\u2019s on track to become the second highest grossing movie of the year,\u201d she noted proudly. Hesitantly, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t mean this the wrong way, but are you sure you\u2019re the right Spirit? Or that you weren\u2019t sent to the wrong person?\u201d She stared at me sternly. \u201cMaybe you think that because I\u2019m a bunny I can\u2019t be a real Spirit?\u201d \u201cNo, no!\u201d I protested. \u201cI just wondered what you were going to show me.\u201d \u201cOh! Yes. Yes! My movie. Let\u2019s go!\u201d She grabbed my wrist and in a whirl, I was whisked away. I found myself in a movie theater, where an animated movie called Zootopia was playing, with Judy in the starring role. Watching the movie The city of Zootopia was a beautiful place to live. It was populated by animals who had evolved so they were all vegetarians. Their economy seemed mostly like our own, with buying and selling and corporations and advertising \u2013 but no poor people. There was, however, one problem in Zootopia, which was that some animals believed hurtful and wrong things about other animals. In particular, some animals thought that predators still had different DNA from non-predators and so were inherently violent. Also, animals often assumed that bunnies were cute, dumb, fluffy things who couldn\u2019t do anything serious. This was annoying to Judy, but the first two thirds of the movie show her convincing even animals who underestimate her that she is exceptional. She wants to become a police officer, even though the conventional wisdom is that bunnies can\u2019t become cops. She ignores this and becomes valedictorian of the police academy. When she starts work, the police chief doesn\u2019t recognize her ability immediately and puts her on parking duty. Although she is understandably offended at having to do this sort of work, she resolves to show he was wrong about her, and so instead of handing out 100 tickets like she was told to do, she gives out 200 , all before her lunch break. She starts fighting back. She goes over the police chief\u2019s head and gets herself an assignment more reflective of her true abilities. One time, a fox named Nick had tricked her about something and then laughed at her for being liberal and naive. Now she evens the score \u2013 she threatens to have Nick thrown in jail for tax violations, and using this leverage, gets him to follow her all over town. She makes him illegally enter private property and go places where he feels threatened. \u201cWhat a strong, intrepid character,\u201d I thought to myself. As time passes, Nick starts to appreciate how awesome Judy is, and they become friends. She exposes a scandal and everyone realizes that she\u2019s a great cop. Right in that moment, though, she comes face to face with a second adversary: her unconscious mind. In the midst of a press conference, Judy gets asked an awkward question about why the animals involved in a series of incidents were all predators. She doesn\u2019t think about what the right thing to say is, and the first thing that pops into her head is that maybe it\u2019s because predators have different DNA than non-predators. It\u2019s just what the anti-predator animals wanted her to say, and it makes Nick feel terrible. Anti-predator prejudice explodes, although thankfully pop stars speak out against it. Judy tries to get Nick to help her fix things, but Nick is still furious with her. Judy pleads with him: Wait, listen\u2026 I-I know you\u2019ll never forgive me, and I don\u2019t blame you. I wouldn\u2019t forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. But predators shouldn\u2019t suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this. But I can\u2019t do it without you. And after we\u2019re done, you can hate me, [begins to cry] and\u2026 and that\u2019ll be fine, because I was a horrible friend, and I hurt you, and you\u2026 and you can walk away knowing that you were right all along \u2013 I really am just a dumb bunny. Nick forgives her then, and things work out. They expose a plot by the anti-predator animals, and send the leader, an evil sheep, to jail. All conflict melts away as the animals dance together to the pop singer\u2019s finale. After the movie \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d the Spirit Judy asked me excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m just so impressed,\u201d I told her. She grinned. \u201cWho would have thought that a billion-dollar corporation like Disney would have the courage to make such a strong statement in support of progressive values?\u201d I went on. \u201cI know!\u201d she said. \u201cIt did a great job showing how little things that we don\u2019t think of as bad can be hurtful to others. For example, while you were in the big city, you were carrying around a thing like a can of mace that was made to drive away foxes. And it sort of helped you to feel safe\u2026\u201d She blushed, ashamed. \u201cBut it made Nick feel bad, because it implied I thought foxes were dangerous.\u201d \u201cIt showed how our attitudes can really affect people\u2019s lives. For example, Nick was making his living as a crook, and you might have thought that it was because times were hard and he had difficulty finding a job\u2026\u201d Judy nodded soberly. \u201cBut actually,\u201d she said, \u201cit was all because when he was very young, he had wanted to be nice and good. But then some of the other young animals just assumed that since he was a fox, he had to be untrustworthy, and so he was like, \u2018well, then I might as well be untrustworthy.\u2019 \u201c \u201cIn general, your movie didn\u2019t play it safe,\u201d I said. \u201cFor example, you\u2019re an open-minded bunny and you always try to treat others with respect. But still, one time you carelessly said something that was really not good. And then, the only way you could return to being a good bunny was to convince yourself that you were truly a bad bunny, and say so publicly.\u201d \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Judy said. \u201cEven though I\u2019m really embarrassed that I said those horrible things, at least this way I could model for the children watching the movie how they ought to act when they say something wrong.\u201d \u201cThe movie definitely delved into difficult issues,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAt the same time, it had plenty of humor. Like there was that time you go to the DMV, and the employees there, the sloths, just operate in a lower gear than the rest of us. Which was hilarious for anyone who\u2019s had to deal with real life public employees.\u201d Judy shook her head. \u201cI was in a hurry and it was just so frustrating. But I know I shouldn\u2019t let it bother me \u2013 they can\u2019t help it.\u201d \u201cThe movie often combined humor and teaching moments. Like there was the really, really fat police dispatcher, so I just assumed he eats doughnuts all the time. And then he calls you a cute bunny, and you\u2019re very patient with him, and are like, \u2018Ooh, uh, you probably didn\u2019t know, but a bunny can call another bunny cute, but when other animals do it, it\u2019s a little\u2026\u2019 And so you deftly addressed the theme of political correctness, but it didn\u2019t feel preachy because then there was a light-hearted moment\u2026\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Judy laughed, \u201cbecause he really did have a doughnut stuck in the fat folds of his neck.\u201d \u201cOr when they put the evil sheep in jail at the end,\u201d I went on, \u201cand the other inmates touch her wool \u2018cause it\u2019s soft and fluffy, which makes her really mad, because as you explained earlier in the movie\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 touching a sheep\u2019s wool is a microaggression and it\u2019s not okay,\u201d Judy supplied helpfully. \u201cBut she was xenophobic and hurt a lot of people, so when her wool gets touched, technically it\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s also kind of funny,\u201d I concluded. \u201cAnother way the movie used humor was to show how it isn\u2019t smart to be prejudiced. For example, your parents sometimes said prejudiced things, but that didn\u2019t make us want to be like them, because after all \u2013 I mean, not to be critical or anything \u2013 they\u2019re rural, they have a really big family, they\u2019re always saying \u2018gosh\u2019 and \u2018amen to that,\u2019 they don\u2019t really have ambitions\u2026\u201d Judy fought back a smile. \u201cYeah, I love them to death, but they\u2019re kind of old-fashioned.\u201d \u201cAnd so the movie shows,\u201d I went on, \u201chow when you have wrong ideas, your kids just won\u2019t listen to you. Like when you were little, they would try to give you advice, and you would just wander off and they wouldn\u2019t even notice you were gone. Or there was that scene where they tried to get you to bring fox repellent with you to the big city \u2013 because a fox had beaten you up one time, and they were worried it would happen again. And you knew that carrying fox repellent was prejudiced, but finally you just said, \u2018I will take this \u2013 to make you stop talking.\u2019\u201c Judy laughed. \u201cThey mean well, they really do \u2013 it\u2019s just that there are some things they don\u2019t really understand.\u201d \u201cOn a side note,\u201d I added, \u201cI think it\u2019s really awesome how even though you\u2019re a bunny, you really have the mannerisms of white Millennial upper-middle-class girls down cold.\u201d \u201cThanks!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it just goes to show,\u201d I continued excitedly, \u201cthat the right-wingers are totally wrong about us when they say we want to stamp out gender roles and make women exactly like men!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2026 do\u2026 you\u2026 mean?\u201d she said, her voice full of warning notes. I went on obliviously. \u201cI just mean, you do lots of things in the movie that they wouldn\u2019t have guys do. Like for example, you force Nick to follow you around and do whatever you tell him, and that\u2019s awesome \u2018cause it showcases how you\u2019re a strong female character, but if he had forced you to follow himaround\u2026\u201d \u201cThat would be controlling and creepy and horrible!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cObviously. But Nick wouldn\u2019t do that. So what\u2019s your point?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure if this conversation was going in a good direction. Instead, I said, \u201cActually, I\u2019m worried \u2013 maybe your time is short. In case we get cut off, what is the most important thing you want me to learn from your visit?\u201d She looked at her watch. \u201cOh, yes. Yes. I do have to go,\u201d she said. Then she smiled at me warmly. \u201cMy final message is, if anyone ever tells you you can\u2019t do anything, or you can\u2019t be anything, don\u2019t believe them. You can .\u201d I looked at her, stricken. \u201cBut Judy, I\u2019m dead.\u201d She looked quizzically at me. \u201cSo? Look, I know a lot of people assume that dead people can\u2019t do certain things, just because they\u2019re dead. But don\u2019t listen to them. Follow your dreams!\u201d And with a peal of thunder, she was gone, and I was back in the livid marshes. * * * The series will take a break for the weekend and resume Monday, at which point Outis will succeed at putting it all together \u2013 sort of.
