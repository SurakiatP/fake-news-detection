One illustrative comparison: A revival this season of \u201cThe Cherry Orchard,\u201d also by Chekhov, topped out at $384, 000 during its best, and final, week of performances. \u201cThe Present,\u201d which opened on Jan. 8, received mixed reviews, but has been selling well since beginning previews on Dec. 17. Last week, a   week for Broadway over all, was the strongest yet for \u201cThe Present,\u201d which had a healthy average admission price of $129 and played to 95 percent full houses, according to figures released Wednesday by the Broadway League for the week ending Jan. 15. The adaptation, written by Ms. Blanchett\u2019s husband, Andrew Upton, is a modern take on Chekhov\u2019s first play, which is most often produced under the title \u201cPlatonov. \u201d Ms. Blanchett, a   Oscar winner, plays a Russian widow who is turning 40 and worried about how to hang on to her home. The play\u2019s action centers on a wild birthday party at which the character\u2019s friends and family have gathered. The overall Broadway season, which began in May and runs through this May, continues to look strong  \u2014   grosses are up 0. 4 percent over the previous,   season. But attendance is now down 1. 1 percent, a potentially worrisome indicator, although there are several   shows scheduled to open later this season. Among the signs of health: Two of this season\u2019s plays announced that they had recouped their capitalization costs, meaning, in industry parlance, that they are hits, and can generate profits until they close this month. A revival of \u201cThe Front Page,\u201d with a cast led by Nathan Lane, has recouped its $4. 875 million capitalization, according to the producer Scott Rudin that production is scheduled to close Jan. 29. And \u201cOh, Hello on Broadway,\u201d starring the comedians Nick Kroll and John Mulaney, has recouped its $2. 9 million capitalization, according to the producers Patrick Catullo and Marcia Goldberg it is scheduled to close on Sunday.'"}, "time": 1742562787.8660486}
