On a cool July evening, these two comedians and musicians from New Zealand, who perform together as Flight of the Conchords, told more than 9, 000 gathered fans that they were sorry for having grown older since their last tour of the United States three years ago. As they age, Mr. Clement said, \u201cIt ultimately reminds you of your mortality, and for that, we apologize. \u201d Their advancing years are showing, too. \u201cIn that time,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said, \u201cwe\u2019ve come to like jazz music. \u201d For the 18 years that this band has existed, Flight of the Conchords has been distinguished by its subtlety: songs, jokes and stage banter so understated, you could be forgiven for not realizing when the two men performing them are joking. \u201cThere\u2019s a very blurred line between the material and us just talking about things,\u201d Mr. McKenzie, 40, said earlier that afternoon as he sat beside Mr. Clement, 42, on a   couch. \u201cThe audience thinks everything is a bit,\u201d Mr. McKenzie continued. \u201cBut often it\u2019s not a bit  \u2014   it\u2019s just us figuring something out. \u201d There was a time, about 10 years ago, when this unassuming pair seemed to have it all figured out in their own quiet way. They had a   HBO series and two Top 20 albums, as well as a Grammy for an earlier EP. They also had (and still have) a bluntness about their careers  \u2014   a lack of interest in familiar enticements like wealth and fame, if not an outright cynicism about the entertainment industry  \u2014   that can be mistaken for their authentically   demeanors. So it was a shock to fans when, in 2009, Mr. Clement and Mr. McKenzie boldly walked away from their HBO series, \u201cFlight of the Conchords,\u201d which they produced in New York and starred in for two seasons. They put their partnership on pause and returned home to Wellington, New Zealand. \u201cIt basically stopped being fun,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t a decision about money. It was definitely a decision about enjoying our lives. \u201d Even in its absence, Flight of the Conchords continued to have an impact. The bohemian ethos of the HBO series has been carried forward in comedies like \u201cGirls\u201d and \u201cBroad City\u201d the homegrown   videos they specialized in have helped spawn a viral internet culture and become staples of   talk shows. Seven years later, the bandmates neither take credit for these developments nor feel that they missed out on them, and they say they are happy with their solo trajectories. Along with the gray hairs in their beards, they each now have wives and children. Mr. Clement has starred in movies like \u201cMen in Black 3\u201d and \u201cThe BFG,\u201d and Mr. McKenzie won an Academy Award for a song he wrote for \u201cThe Muppets. \u201d On their present itinerary, they have nothing to figure out (except a few new songs) and nothing to promote (except themselves). They find themselves playing in bigger spaces than they wished to more admirers than they thought they had. \u201cWe wanted it to be a tour of small venues,\u201d Mr. Clement said. \u201cWe thought interest would have dwindled enough that that\u2019s all we\u2019d be able to do. Then the management put us in places like this. \u201d (Their coming dates include Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, N. Y. on July 20, and SummerStage in Central Park on July 24.) While they are flattered to still have a following, they point out that Flight of the Conchords was intended, as Mr. Clement put it, \u201cas a hobby and a side thing\u201d  \u2014   something to do, to help them reach the things they really wanted to be doing. \u201cThis was just our   project,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we had two songs. And then three. \u201d While Mr. Clement strummed absently at a guitar on his lap, Mr. McKenzie explained that the tour was a good way to get them to focus on writing new songs and spare them the mild indignity of relying on past hits. \u201cWorking at our own pace is not one of our strengths,\u201d he said. \u201cLouis C. K. goes off and makes something. We wouldn\u2019t get \u2019round to it. \u201d This summer they have been trying out tunes about partying as tepid, timid   a duet that imagines Mr. Clement and Mr. McKenzie as a dysfunctional father and son and a   ballad about a   hombre who meets his doppelg\u00e4nger. (Their repertoire still includes favorites like the dystopian death anthem \u201cRobots\u201d and the domestic sex jam \u201cBusiness Time,\u201d on which Mr. Clement whispers that Tuesday night is when \u201cwe go and visit your mother, but Wednesday night we make sweet, weekly love. \u201d) There are no immediate plans to record the new numbers for an album. \u201cIf someone wants to convince me to do it,\u201d Mr. Clement said, \u201cit would be from the angle of, \u2018People want to hear it, and it would be selfish not to let them. \u2019\u201d With a laugh, he added: \u201cEven doing this interview, I was like, \u2018Why are we doing an interview? \u2019\u201d (They said they were told the Forest Hills show needed some extra promotion. \u201cPride is a good way to go,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cThat\u2019s our weakness. \u201d) From the outset, when they met as students at Victoria University of Wellington and performed in a variety of comedy groups, Mr. Clement and Mr. McKenzie have walked a line between caring just enough about their work to do a good job and not caring at all. When Flight of the Conchords broke through in the early 2000s, at events like the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the (now defunct) U. S. Comedy Arts Festival, it tapped into a sensibility seen in comedies like Larry David\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d and Ricky Gervais\u2019s \u201cThe Office. \u201d \u201cThere was this new wave of cringe humor, awkward humor, and stepping through that doorway were two of the most awkward people you\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Rhys Darby, a New   comedian who often works with Mr. Clement and Mr. McKenzie. Where the spirit of Flight of the Conchords differed, Mr. Darby said, was: \u201cThere was no pessimism about it. It was more of a na\u00efve happiness. They were from another world. \u201d A BBC radio program led to the HBO series, in which Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Clement played versions of themselves, two unsophisticated New Zealanders adrift in New York, and Mr. Darby played their hapless manager. But producing the HBO series, they said, was grueling  \u2014   Mr. McKenzie said he counted a period of 110 days without a day off  \u2014   even when they split their duties so Mr. Clement could rewrite scripts while Mr. McKenzie composed music. Having previously instructed their agents not to tell them how much HBO was offering them for renewals, they simply walked away from a potential third season. (Now they joke that they should have copied Dave Chappelle, who exited his popular \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d in  . \u201cWe should have done the third season, just taken the money and gone to Africa like Chappelle,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said.) Friends of the band mates say they approached their hiatus with an intentional aimlessness. The humorist John Hodgman, who often performs with Flight of the Conchords, said, \u201cThe feeling I got was not that they were itching to see what else was out there for them, but they wanted to see how much less was available. \u201d The comedian Eugene Mirman, a frequent collaborator, said their individual successes had validated these explorations. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they formed two solo bands  \u2014   it\u2019s more that they now do a variety of things,\u201d Mr. Mirman said. \u201cBret won an Oscar. If that\u2019s not enough, I don\u2019t know what you believe someone\u2019s solo career is supposed to be. \u201d This time out, Mr. Hodgman said, \u201cThey seem to be having a really good time. But for them to say they\u2019re having a good time, in their weird New Zealand minds, would be bragging. So they would never say it. \u201d Mr. Clement and Mr. McKenzie each have a slate of personal assignments to keep busy: Mr. McKenzie is writing a film adaptation of the Neil Gaiman children\u2019s book \u201cFortunately, the Milk,\u201d and Mr. Clement is working on an unspecified TV project, happy not to be writing more music. \u201cI just can\u2019t handle being in a studio,\u201d Mr. Clement said. \u201cI like playing music live and not hearing the mistakes I\u2019m making. \u201d (Mr. McKenzie, who has written songs for two   Muppet movies, said, \u201cI\u2019ve loved coming back and working on songs where you can swear. \u201d) Perhaps when the tour is over, Flight of the Conchords will be persuaded to play a   HBO concert special. Mr. Clement said, \u201cSomeone will come to us at the end and say either, \u2018This is almost ready for the special,\u2019 or \u2018This is ready for the special. \u2019\u201d But the band does not aspire to anything more ambitious. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not trying to get a TV show,\u201d he said, with the most emphasis he\u2019d used in the conversation. For now they were satisfied to be playing a show that can be as loose and   as they want, and nostalgic only for a time when they could play it smaller, sloppier and to fewer people. \u201cThere\u2019s bits that we know don\u2019t work, that we just haven\u2019t gotten \u2019round to fixing,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. Mr. Clement added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell now. It\u2019s easier in a small bar than it is here. Silence is more obvious in a small crowd. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561936.464028}
