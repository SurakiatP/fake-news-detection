That afternoon, it had inched up to 4. 25, and by evening, when he finally called back to finalize the deal, it was 4. 375 percent. \u201cI was kind of frustrated,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said. But with a third child on the way, and a buyer for their current home, he and his wife felt they had little choice. \u201cInstead of holding out and waiting, we locked it in,\u201d he said. Since the election, mortgage rates have climbed roughly half a percentage point to a   high, adding hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars to a home buyer\u2019s yearly payments. (The annual cost of a $400, 000 mortgage, for example, rose almost $700.) The speed and size of the increase took many lenders and borrowers by surprise  \u2014   and the increase is expected to reverberate across the housing industry, particularly if rates continue to rise next year. \u201cAnybody who was floating or didn\u2019t lock in a rate is screaming at their lender: \u2018How could you do this to me? \u2019\u201d said Guy D. Cecala, chief executive and publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. \u201cIt shot up from 3. 5 to 4 percent virtually overnight,\u201d he said, referring to the average     mortgage. \u201cDoes it give people pause? Does it raise the cost of buying a home?\u201d Mr. Cecala asked. \u201cYes and yes. \u201d For most of this year, American home buyers have benefited from weakness in the global economy. China has been struggling to sustain the rapid growth it needs to avoid political unrest, a deep recession followed political turmoil in Brazil, and a cloud of uncertainty hangs over Europe after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Those factors, on top of efforts by central banks around the world to stimulate economic activity by keeping   interest rates low, have increased demand for safe American assets like government bonds and   securities. The result: The cost for American businesses and consumers to borrow had, until recently, remained exceptionally low. The turnaround, which was driven by postelection market expectations that a President Trump would lift corporate profits, cut taxes and spend money on infrastructure and roads, caught most experts by surprise. The online real estate brokerage Redfin, for example, had initially forecast that rates for   fixed mortgages would remain below 4 percent through next year, said Glenn Kelman, the company\u2019s chief executive. Redfin has now updated its forecast and is predicting the   mortgage rate will pass the 4 percent threshold. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see higher rates than we otherwise would have,\u201d Mr. Kelman said, \u201cbut more economic stimulus. \u201d Wall Street is also expecting that the Federal Reserve Bank will increase its benchmark interest rate when it meets next month. That rate  \u2014    the cost that banks and depository institutions charge one another for overnight loans  \u2014   has only an indirect impact on mortgage rates. Last December, for instance, after the Fed raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point, mortgage rates went down. But to the extent it reflects the Fed\u2019s confidence in an improving economic outlook, it could signal higher borrowing costs in the months ahead. For now, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, a real estate data provider, the relatively modest increase in mortgage rates should not have much impact on the current housing market. \u201cMost consumers don\u2019t make decisions based on a change in mortgage rates,\u201d Ms. Gudell said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with such a tight inventory, I think they\u2019re more focused on finding a home that they can afford. If mortgage rates go up by half a percent, that\u2019s not going to make them change their minds. \u201d On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported existing home sales rose 2 percent at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate in October, its strongest pace since February 2007, before the recession started. Back then, the average   fixed rate mortgage topped 6 percent, a reminder that even with the recent rate jump, mortgages remain a bargain by historical standards. Thirty years ago, the average rate was about 10 percent. Still, for buyers who had been counting on paying less than 3. 5 percent, the postelection bump represents an unwelcome added cost. In the last couple of weeks, requests for refinancing have dropped, according to Gregory Gwizdz, national sales manager of Wells Fargo Home Lending, one of the nation\u2019s largest home loan originators. He expects that trend to continue through next year as rates stay at this level or inch higher. Although he hasn\u2019t seen any impact on home buying in the last two weeks, Mr. Gwizdz said that rate increases \u201ccreate some sense of urgency. \u201d \u201cIf people believe rates are on the rise,\u201d he said, \u201cthey may try to find that home sooner rather than later. \u201d Higher rates are often followed by a burst of activity from consumers worried about further increases. But Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he had not seen evidence of   demand. He thinks housing activity is heading for a fall. Even before this latest bump in rates, he was concerned about a drop in mortgage applications. Mortgage standards have tightened this year, he said, making it more difficult for buyers to qualify despite the steady uptick in wages. \u201cEven if applications don\u2019t go down further,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said, \u201cwe are looking at a significant drop in home sales in the first quarter of next year. \u201d For those looking to purchase a home, different types of loans may become more appealing. Buyers of new construction, who have to wait months for their homes to be completed, may be willing to pay a little more to lock in a lower rate for an extended period of time, Mr. Gwizdz said. Those who plan to move again in the next few years might be more likely to consider an   mortgage than before. In Westchester County, north of New York City, J. Philip Faranda, a real estate broker, said that buyers often had differing motivations, with some focused on the investment prospects and others guided by nonmonetary factors. \u201cIf you\u2019re expecting twins, you\u2019re buying now no matter what the interest rates are,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re setting a date for your wedding, you may be putting that on hold. \u201d Bic N. DeCaro, a real estate agent in Northern Virginia, said that before the election most clients had been dragging their feet, uncertain about what to do. But since rates started to move up, \u201cthere was a flurry of activity,\u201d she said, leading to more showings and two signed contracts. In Phoenix, Luis Solis, a real estate broker, said some of his clients have also ramped up their searches in the past week. \u201cPeople are afraid they are going to go up really fast,\u201d he said. As it turns out, Mr. Solis is in the midst of buying a larger house for his own family in Phoenix\u2019s central corridor. \u201cWe were lucky that we locked in our rate on November 1,\u201d he said. \u201cRates have really jumped. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563574.4967465}
