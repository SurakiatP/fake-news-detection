But the scattering of peadophile priests is fine, though; when we\u2019re doing it,\u201d before adding, \u201cPlease leave all the important decisions on the welfare of others to us. We won\u2019t let any of our worshipers down\u201d. \\nThe latest move comes just 53 years after the Vatican \u2018legalised\u2019 cremation, mirroring the amount of time it takes for the church to act on various different subjects, including child sex abuse. \\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make decisions lightly here, so we like to take our time,\u201d the Cardinal admitted, \u201cBut when we do, we like to make sure that they are the best decisions tailored for the financial gain of our multi-billion euro a year organisation\u201d. \\nA two-page instruction issuing new rules on cremation also said that there were even some cases where a Christian funeral could be denied to those who request that ashes be scattered. \\n\u201cThere is absolutely no profit for us if someone gets cremated and spread over some field for free,\u201d Muller pointed out, breathing on a 24 carrot ring on his hand before polishing it on his silk gown, \u201cWe offer an array of allotments across the world, and at a bargain price too. We\u2019ll even throw in an annual mass and a few prayers graveside for any cremated relative wishing to be buried on sacred ground\u201d. \\nAllotments can range anywhere between \u20ac5,000 to \u20ac19,000 for a family plot, with the church charging over \u20ac20,000 for extra holy burial slots.'"}, "time": 1742563591.7222028}
