The second question is how much he pays. He doesn\u2019t know the answer to the first. As for his rent? Tell a New Yorker you pay $450 a month, and he or she becomes very, very jealous. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have any idea,\u201d Mr. Leahy said. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018The Phantom of the Opera\u2019  \u2014   how much did that guy pay?\u201d On a recent evening, Mr. Leahy, a    musician who moved to New York from Austin, Tex. late last September, pulled up in front of his home address on a skateboard, a Narragansett tall boy in one hand. The sun was setting over the East River, so he suggested a stop in his \u201cliving room\u201d  \u2014   a rock outcropping on the banks  \u2014   before climbing the ladder to his quarters. Yes, a ladder. While real estate agents and promoters often describe local hot spots as extensions of one\u2019s living space, utilizing the amenities of greater Williamsburg is a necessity for Mr. Leahy. His windowless den measures roughly 9 feet long and 4. 5 feet wide. You can stand at the entry, but once inside you mostly stoop  \u2014   it\u2019s only about 5 feet high. A   futon mattress takes up most of the space. Mr. Leahy, who works at Best Pizza in Williamsburg, spends a lot of time watching soccer at a nearby bar, or in his $   music studio in East Williamsburg, which he says is about the same size as his crawl space, except that the ceiling is of normal height. It also lacks a window, but he can at least unfurl his   frame  \u2014   a nice change from stooping. He also likes to browse the record shops in Greenpoint, which is also the home of Captured Tracks, the independent record label that he hopes will sign him someday. \u201cThat label was the reason I moved to New York,\u201d said Mr. Leahy, a   composer who goes by the name Socrates. Mr. Leahy is proficient on keyboards, synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers. \u201cI mix and record everything on an old    tape machine,\u201d he said. Mr. Leahy must keep quiet during rehearsals in the performance space below him, which can be any time between 9 a. m. and 10 p. m. seven days a week. Fortunately, the   is great, so he can always watch soccer matches if he doesn\u2019t feel like reading. He\u2019s also required to maintain a ghostly profile in the kitchen and office in the back of the building, which is where the bathroom is. It has a shower, in case you were wondering. Despite the restrictions, Mr. Leahy faced fierce competition and had to woo his way into his cubbyhole. His   an artist, told him about the unorthodox residence and referred him to the landlords, who were swayed, he said, by his \u201cvery long, thoughtful, funny, charming email\u201d that described, in detail, his minimal grocery storage needs. He took the space sight unseen and insists that he had no misgivings when he arrived. \u201cI think I was happy to be in New York and that I actually had a place,\u201d Mr. Leahy said. \u201cIt was just kind of comical. It is comical. Whenever I show people where I live, they always laugh. \u201d He awakens many mornings to the sounds of experimental theater: strange clanging, performers speaking in gibberish, chants. The space is ovenlike in the summer, cozy in winter. And though he doesn\u2019t see much of them, he likes his  : seven other artists and creative types who live in the warren of more traditional rooms at the back of the building. \u201cThough I\u2019m always jealous when I see them sitting on chairs in their rooms,\u201d he admits. Occasionally, there are parties in the building  \u2014   and not just any parties, really good ones  \u2014   \u201cthe kind of thing you\u2019d imagine happening in Bushwick or Ridgewood,\u201d he says. There are some serious drawbacks, of course. The door behind his bed opens onto a sheer drop into the performance space, which gave him a scare a few months back when he leaned against it and felt it moving. Nor does he recommend nights of heavy drinking or hosting visitors, especially if romance is in the cards. \u201cThings get intimate really fast. You basically can\u2019t do anything but lie down,\u201d Mr. Leahy warned. \u201cAt the same time, too much moving around up here doesn\u2019t feel safe. \u201d Nonetheless, he recently decided to stay for another year. Romantic rendezvous chez Leahy are not a concern at the moment. He got back together with his girlfriend, the one who told him about the crawl space, and she lives in a nearby studio  \u2014   a proper one, with windows and more than enough clearance to walk upright. And while some people might find even a   studio cramped for two, Mr. Leahy is not one of them. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt feels like a great hall. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562256.812585}
