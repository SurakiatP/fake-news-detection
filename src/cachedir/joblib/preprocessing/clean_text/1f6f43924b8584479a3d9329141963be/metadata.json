In fact, attempting to reclaim property and cash can be a nightmare of red tape, court appearances and legal fees \u2014 and, even then, isn\u2019t always a successful venture. And like so many others, Slatic had not been familiar with this legal, policing-for-profit scheme prior to his firsthand encounter. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d he told the Institute for Justice. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond frustrating that my family\u2019s money was taken without any criminal charges being filed. My wife and teenage daughters had nothing to do with my business whatsoever, and the District Attorney took their college savings accounts. This is not just wrong; it is unconstitutional.\u201d \\nWhile he certainly might be right, CAF is federal law \u2014 a brief reprieve in January, when the Department of Justice suspended the program, only lasted through early April \u2014 because the ability of police to steal people\u2019s stuff and either use it or the proceeds from its sale is just too damned profitable. \\nIndeed, police and other agencies \u2014 particularly the Drug Enforcement Agency \u2014 make a killing in this legalized State robbery sham, and many departments have come to rely on CAF profiteering to bolster their funding. \\n\u201cCivil forfeiture is one of the greatest threats to property rights in the nation,\u201d said IJ attorney Allison Daniel, also representing the Slatic family. \u201cCivil forfeiture takes the American principle of innocent until proven guilty and flips it on its head, treating property owners worse than criminals by making them prove their innocence.\u201d \\nAt 7:30 in the morning on January 28, 2016 \u2014 as surveillance cameras outside and inside Med-West captured on video \u2014 the San Diego Joint Narcotics Task Force used a sledgehammer to break down the door of Slatic\u2019s legal business, and stormed in, pointing automatic weapons at the heads of innocent employees inside. \\nNeedlessly and recklessly, around 28 officers took everything of value inside, destroying and scattering property in the process. \\nAs Slatic told IJ, in addition to assets stolen from the business, the greedy cops cleared family bank accounts of over $100,000 \u2014 leaving his daughters scrambling to pay for school supplies, like college textbooks, while putting their tuition and fees in jeopardy. \\nAnnette Slatic, James\u2019 wife, who works as a nurse at the Veterans Administration, found out about the raid and financial seizure when she tried to pay for groceries that morning and had her card declined. Then her daughter, Penny, a high-schooler, tried to pay using her ATM card \u2014 and was also declined. Without notice, the Slatics suddenly found themselves essentially penniless and unsure how to afford basic needs. \\nNow they\u2019re fighting to get everything back, since under California law, \u201cprobable cause\u201d a crime has been committed must be established before officers can use civil asset forfeiture to seize property and cash. \\nAs the Institute for Justice explains, \u201cBecause police and prosecutors ignored Med-West\u2019s status as a legal marijuana business, they did not have probable cause to seize the Slatics\u2019 money. Even if Med-West had been an illegal operation (and it was not), the Slatics\u2019 personal money is not connected to the business.\u201d \\nPerhaps the Slatics will have better luck in getting justice than innumerable others who have been unfortunate enough to be victims of legalized robbery. \\nDespite massive controversy surrounding the program \u2014 and one of its creators now denouncing the policing-for-profit scheme it has become \u2014 civil asset forfeiture won\u2019t be going anywhere soon. \\nWhile some states have severely curtailed cops\u2019 ability to take your stuff, by implementing strictures requiring a conviction and similar limits, others have taken CAF to new levels. Oklahoma Highway Patrol began using a device called an ERAD , which scans bank and prepaid cards \u2014 right from a person\u2019s wallet \u2014 to seize all cash in an individual\u2019s account during a traffic stop if an officer even suspects a person of committing a drug-related offense. \\n\u201cThree decades ago, I helped create our civil asset forfeiture system,\u201d wrote Brad Cates in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal , \u201cnow it\u2019s time to end it.\u201d \\nThis is what it\u2019s like to run a legal business, pay taxes, and follow the law in a Police State: Share'"}, "time": 1742628595.110115}
