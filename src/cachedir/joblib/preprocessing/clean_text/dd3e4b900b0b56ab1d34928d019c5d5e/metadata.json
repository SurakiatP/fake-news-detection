The primary question is, what are we going to do about chemical warfare? A hundred years ago, right now, World War I was going on, and there were people were being gassed in the trenches. And the fact that the world community has basically tried to eliminate chemical weapons since that time strikes me as a great achievement. And to go back on that would be a great step backward for civilization. And Barack Obama, unfortunately, didn\u2019t do anything when chemical weapons were used. So, I think it was incumbent upon the US to do something when chemical weapons were used. \u201d He continued, \u201cDoes this signal some grand change of strategy in the Middle East? I sort of doubt it. But at least we set this precedent on this particular issue. Now, the question  \u2014   I think it was probably totally impulsive of President Trump to do this. He\u2019s an impulsive person, and we\u2019re stuck the downsides of his impulsivity. But there are upsides to having an impulsive president because nobody in the world, and especially in places like North Korea, quite knows what\u2019s going to happen. And so, frankly, there are some advantages to that. \u201d Brooks later added, \u201cI would rather have a strategy, obviously. But I\u2019m just pointing out there is some upside to having somebody who\u2019s a little unpredictable.   \u2026     I suspect it was a   case  \u2026    but I think it was the right   thing to do. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742562281.4818797}
