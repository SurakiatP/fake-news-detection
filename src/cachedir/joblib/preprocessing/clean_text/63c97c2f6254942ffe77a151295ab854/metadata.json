Yet it\u2019s coming, anyway: \u201cPatriots Day,\u201d a film about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, directed by Peter Berg and starring Mark Wahlberg, a Beantown son, as a police officer. The film nabbed the   slot at the American Film Institute festival in November, landed on the National Board of Review\u2019s Top 10 list, and opens on Dec. 21, prime time for awards. For a picture that some feel is arriving too soon, or that risks being exploitative or worse, \u201cPatriots Day\u201d stands, on the one hand, to be unintentionally well timed. At a recent screening in Manhattan, as audience members gasped their way through tears, it became clear that the film got at something more elemental than tragedy: It captured the purity of the altruistic outpouring that came in the bombings\u2019 wake. Sniffling away, the Bagger couldn\u2019t help wondering, might this be a film that makes both blue hearts and red hearts crack open, and proves a unifier of sorts? Then again, we are living in times when the very definition of \u201cpatriot\u201d is deeply contested and fraught, when the word alone often causes liberal neck hair to stand on end. \u201cPatriots Day\u201d is Mr. Berg and Mr. Wahlberg\u2019s third film together, after this year\u2019s \u201cDeepwater Horizon,\u201d about the deadly 2010 oil explosion and spill, and the 2013 \u201cLone Survivor,\u201d about a disastrous war mission. All three neatly fit the definition of what Rolling Stone describes as the \u201c  blockbuster\u201d: movies whose heroes wear blue collars rather than cowboy hats or capes. \u201cThese are films that seek to whitewash America,\u201d Corey Atad wrote in Esquire, \u201cboosting the virtue of pure patriotism, fashioning an uncomplicated reality for an audience tired of feeling like their country is being lost to liberal pussyfooting and terrorist threats. \u201d Also in that category is Clint Eastwood\u2019s     hit \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d which became such a partisan flash point two years ago  \u2014   lefties deemed it   propaganda righties saw it as a patriotic masterpiece  \u2014   that some liberals who consider themselves open and tolerant refused to see it outright. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Berg and Mr. Wahlberg say that \u201cPatriots Day\u201d holds resonance, no matter what the viewers\u2019 political bent, be they, in the director\u2019s words, \u201cthe most liberal      in the world\u201d or \u201cneoconservatives that I know, good friends that are on the far other side. \u201d \u201cWe get asked this a lot, about our politics, and we\u2019re just not going to get into it,\u201d Mr. Berg said, sitting with Mr. Wahlberg this week to chat with the Bagger in a suite at the Carlyle Hotel. \u201cMark and I both wanted to make a film about love. A film about: \u2018You know what? If you think you\u2019re going to beat us through violence, you\u2019re wrong. Because love will rise, love will defeat evil. \u2019\u201d \u201cI have friends on both sides who believe that love does win,\u201d Mr. Berg continued. \u201cAnd they\u2019re very kind, loving people. So we feel there\u2019s a little something for everyone in this. \u201d Mr. Berg and Mr. Wahlberg arrived separately, each wearing the resigned, blank look that movie people tend to get after doing three straight days of press. They had been through this gantlet just three months ago, with \u201cDeepwater Horizon. \u201d Meanwhile, for some Bostonians, the marathon atrocity is still too fresh. It was only last year that the surviving Boston bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was tried and convicted. And this year, the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, denied the filmmakers\u2019 request to film on campus, as did the suburb of Watertown, where the police and the Tsarnaev brothers engaged in a firefight. (That filming was moved to nearby Malden and a former naval air base.) Given all that, didn\u2019t it seem that \u201cPatriots\u201d was made and released in haste? Nay, Mr. Berg said. \u201cMark\u2019s fond of saying it probably wasn\u2019t soon enough, in many ways,\u201d the director said. \u201cWe felt the real theme of this film wasn\u2019t going to be about a manhunt of justice being served up, although those were elements of this story. At the end of the day, the story was about how a community responded to kind of what unfortunately is becoming the new reality of our lives. \u201d But there was competition. Mr. Wahlberg brought the idea of the film to Mr. Berg near the end of the production of \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d last year. Films about the marathon bombings were in the works: one from CBS Films another based on the book \u201cBoston Strong\u201d and a third, \u201cStronger,\u201d starring Jake Gyllenhaal, which is to open next year. Mr. Wahlberg ultimately teamed up with CBS Films, and they bought the rights to \u201cBoston Strong,\u201d folding some of its elements into \u201cPatriots Day. \u201d \u201cI was really on the fence  \u2014   do we make this?\u201d Mr. Wahlberg recalled. \u201cThen I quickly realized that there\u2019s three movies, and they\u2019re aggressively trying to get these movies made. \u201d He added later that he decided: \u201cThey\u2019re going to do it anyway. I better do it so I can make sure we do it the right way. \u201d The youngest of nine, Mr. Wahlberg grew up in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, where he had a violent,   and   youth. He has maintained deep connections there, and the city and nearby region have been the site of a number of his films: \u201cThe Departed,\u201d \u201cThe Fighter\u201d and, of course, \u201cTed\u201d and \u201cTed 2. \u201d To prepare for \u201cPatriots Day,\u201d Mr. Wahlberg, who knew people directly affected by the bombings, he and Mr. Berg sat down to hear residents\u2019 concerns  \u2014   about how loved ones would be portrayed, about the effect on grieving children, about being retraumatized. As the father of the youngest victim,    Martin Richard, requested, no one from that family was portrayed in the film, though there are scenes showing the blanketed body of a child. After poring over hours of grisly footage, Mr. Berg, who cites the work of Studs Terkel, fabled chronicler of the American Everyman, as a major influence, said he struggled mightily to make sense of the atrocity, and to understand how affected families found the energy to go on. He found his answer at this year\u2019s marathon, where he and Mr. Wahlberg watched Patrick Downes become the first Boston bombing amputee to complete the race. He fell into the arms of his wife, who lost both legs in the bombings  \u2014   footage of their embrace is in the film. At that moment, Mr. Wahlberg said, an    woman from the Boston Athletic Association approached them both and said: \u201cYou see that? That\u2019s what this movie better be about. About love. You make sure you get that right. \u201d That has become Mr. Berg and Mr. Wahlberg\u2019s main talking point, how the city came together afterward, how, moments after the bombing, paramedics, the police, firefighters, high school girls who had been handing out Gatorade all rushed toward victims to help. \u201cYou think about, did anyone stop and ask someone before they helped them what political party they were associated with?\u201d Mr. Berg said. \u201cWhat their sexual orientation was, you know, where they stood on gun control? Nobody cared. That was really an example of the angels within us, the very best versions of ourselves. \u201d Ergo the sobbing Mr. Berg was surprised to hear in early screenings of the film. \u201cCrying can be a good thing,\u201d he said, \u201ca catharsis and a release. \u201d The Bagger can attest to that. And liberals, if you\u2019re still hesitant, keep in mind that the film is set in deep blue Boston, where four out of five presidential votes went to the Democrats. They\u2019re your people, too.'"}, "time": 1742563337.4418688}
