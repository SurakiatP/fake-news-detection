A celebrated feminist legal scholar, Ms. Estrich was the first female president of The Harvard Law Review. Working for Michael S. Dukakis in 1988, she was the first woman to manage a presidential campaign. And in 1991 she coined the term \u201cnuts and sluts\u201d to describe the campaign Clarence Thomas supporters waged to discredit Anita Hill. Ms. Estrich took a different position in a 1998 opinion column defending President Bill Clinton. She wrote, \u201cThe reason men resort to the \u2018nuts and sluts\u2019 defense is because it may be the only way to undermine the credibility of a woman who is not, in fact, telling the truth. \u201d And that seems to be part of her strategy as the chief defender of the former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who lost his job after a number of women accused him of sexual harassment. Ms. Estrich, the author of the 1988 book \u201cReal Rape: How the Legal System Victimizes Women Who Say No,\u201d is now one of the last voices vigorously insisting that Mr. Ailes did nothing wrong. Even the owner of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch, seems not to agree. And that twist is bringing her back into the spotlight, and is puzzling, not to mention enraging, some of the people who once saw her as a role model. When the accusations first surfaced this summer, it shocked many feminists that Ms. Estrich, of all people, would represent Mr. Ailes, a    political operative and the guiding force of Fox News. But it wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. For many years, Ms. Estrich was a lively liberal commentator on Fox News and she has defended another Republican man accused of sexual misconduct, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California. In a phone interview, Ms. Estrich described Mr. Ailes  \u2014   whom she met on the campaign trail in 1988, when he was advising George W. Bush  \u2014   as a close friend. \u201cIn the 18 years I was at Fox News, Roger has never told me what to say, what to do or what to wear,\u201d Ms. Estrich said. \u201cHe kept me on the payroll for seven months when I was too sick to work. \u201d But what really turned heads was Ms. Estrich\u2019s zeal in attacking the New York magazine reporter who first broke the scandal. Interviewed for an article in The Daily Beast, she said, \u201cUltimately, it will become clear that the real enemy of women is Gabe Sherman. \u201d That sounded a little like a \u201cjerks and perks\u201d defense, and Ms. Estrich went on to suggest that Mr. Sherman, who published an unflattering biography of Mr. Ailes in 2014, had his own agenda for pursuing the story. She told The Daily Beast that Mr. Sherman was willing to \u201cuse and abuse\u201d vulnerable women to pursue a vendetta against Mr. Ailes. (Mr. Sherman declined to comment.) The response on social media was vivid, to say the least. \u201cEveryone knows @GabrielSherman is a brilliant journalist and Susan Estrich is a Fox hack,\u201d is how Joan Walsh, a Washington political reporter, put it. Those close to Ms. Estrich say that she is staunchly supportive of her friends and clients and feels particularly beholden to Mr. Ailes for the way he stood by her when she fell gravely ill after a botched gastrointestinal operation in 2014. \u201cSusan is fiercely loyal, to a detriment,\u201d said Cathy Moran, a nurse in Los Angeles who took care of Ms. Estrich during her illness. \u201cShe will not bail on him. \u201d Ms. Moran said that as a friend, she wished Ms. Estrich wasn\u2019t involved in defending Mr. Ailes but that once she takes on a cause, she won\u2019t let it drop  \u2014   even after 21st Century Fox reached a $20 million settlement with Gretchen Carlson and apologized to her publicly. Ms. Moran grimly likened Ms. Estrich\u2019s position to an unwanted pregnancy: \u201cAt some point you reach the point where you can\u2019t terminate. \u201d Ms. Estrich, a partner in the Los Angeles office of the litigation firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan, said that she first heard the allegations against Mr. Ailes on her return from London, and that by the time she got to her apartment there were 10 messages from her old friend on her home voice mail. She didn\u2019t hesitate to take the case, aware that some feminists say that she sold out. \u201cIt is painful, but at the same time I am a lawyer: Once she takes on a case she stands by her client,\u201d Ms. Estrich said in a phone interview. \u201cRoger needs someone to help him through this extremely difficult process. The last thing any client needs is a lawyer sitting in judgment. \u201d Ms. Estrich is a busy lawyer. In addition to her work at Quinn, Emanuel, she is a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law and writes a syndicated political column. Although Mr. Ailes has been advising the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, Ms. Estrich recently referred to \u201cthe demagogue\u2019s angry rants\u201d and his \u201cfeet of clay. \u201d Ms. Estrich, who understandably is less visible on television these days, has a strong, somewhat disconcerting   presence. She speaks in a raspy,    day voice (although she no longer smokes) has an intense gaze and a disarmingly animated manner  \u2014   as if Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in her Supreme Court decisions, put a circle over the I instead of a dot. Her writing is eclectic. In \u201cReal Rape,\u201d a book often cited in legal papers on sexual assault, she describes her own rape by a stranger wielding an ice pick. Ten years later, she published \u201cMaking the Case for Yourself: A Diet Book for Smart Women. \u201d In 2006 she had two more books, \u201cThe Case for Hillary Clinton\u201d and one on the conservative writer Ann Coulter, \u201cSoulless: Ann Coulter and the Right Wing Church of Hate. \u201d Ms. Coulter said that she likes and admires Ms. Estrich  \u2014   and that she had forgotten about the book. \u201cShe is one of the few lawyers I have debated on TV who actually knew what she was talking about,\u201d Ms. Coulter said. She said she understood her decision to defend Mr. Ailes. \u201cGetting her was a brilliant move on Ailes\u2019s part,\u201d she said, and noted that no matter how alarming the allegation, \u201cthis is what lawyers do. If she were doing it pro bono, I would have a different assessment. \u201d Ms. Coulter noted that she had long dismissed the rumors about Mr. Ailes\u2019s mistreatment of female employees. \u201cI figured that if even one tenth of it were true, there would be a lawsuit. \u201d She paused. \u201cThen there was a lawsuit. \u201d There could be a case to be made that Ms. Estrich is being held to a higher standard than male litigators. There was no such outcry when a male colleague at her law firm briefly took on Bill Cosby as a client in 2015. But some feminists say they do expect more of Ms. Estrich. \u201cShe has a higher level of accountability,\u201d said Andi Zeisler, a   of Bitch Magazine. \u201cFor someone who was such a pioneering legal scholar to make Ailes an exception to the trenchant line she has drawn is a depressing irony. \u201d But there are some amusing incongruities as well. Andrea Tantaros, a former Fox anchor who also filed a suit, thanks Mr. Ailes in the acknowledgements of her     \u201cTied Up in Knots: How Getting What We Wanted Made Women Miserable. \u201d Mostly, she complains about how successful women compete with one another, writing, \u201cIn my experience, men in positions of power tend to be less inclined to act as roadblocks. \u201d While Ms. Estrich\u2019s reputation is hotly debated, few observers believe the Ailes case will hurt her practice. \u201cI think in many respects it will increase her status as a lawyer,\u201d said Richard Sauber, a Washington litigator. \u201cThere will be people who will never hire her again, but there may be more who will say, \u2018That\u2019s the kind of lawyer I want. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563236.0730195}
