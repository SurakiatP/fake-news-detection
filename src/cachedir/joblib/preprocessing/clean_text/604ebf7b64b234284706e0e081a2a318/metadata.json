Luis Guti\u00e9rrez ( ) said he was confident Americans will fight back against President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda because he explained, \u201cI\u2019m really not that used to, and I\u2019ve been in Congress 24 years, the number of white women coming up to talk to me. \u201d  Guti\u00e9rrez said, \u201cHe at this point enters into the presidency with an approval rating that we have not seen in recent history for a president beginning, and he hasn\u2019t had an auspicious start with his, you know, alternate realities and alternate facts that he gives us. Everything in Trump\u2019s world is something that he manufactures to fit his scheme of the world. And his scheme of the world is not one that\u2019s fitting with the reality. That\u2019s why you saw over half a million  \u2014   you know, I was there, so half a million, I\u2019ll accept it, but I think there were a lot more women than that, and they came truly, truly organically. \u201d He continued, \u201cI had a town hall meeting last night unprecedented in my congressional district. It was around immigration. That was the issue that we were called to discuss last night. I got to tell you, my heart was just so touched to see people unaffected by our broken immigration system, to see people from, especially white women, the number of white women who felt a need to come out and join and learn and be in solidarity. I\u2019ve got to tell you something, there is something mystical, magical happening out there in the American public, and I want to say thank you to women, because if it had not been for the women calling that march, we would have not come together as Muslims, as immigrants, as environmentalist  \u2014   you know why we\u2019ll push back on Keystone? Because there was a women\u2019s march in Washington, D. C. and that women\u2019s march was a march for environmental standards, and for our native Americans. \u201d He added, \u201cI want to talk real quickly about identity politics. Look, I\u2019m used to Latino women coming up and talking to me, pretty used to   women and Asian women approaching me and talking to me. I\u2019m really not that used to, and I\u2019ve been in Congress 24 years, the number of white women coming up to talk to me in my congressional district, the number of them calling, the kind of exchanges. I was on the airplane going back Sunday from the march, they all clapped for me, right? Is that really identity politics? A Latino male from the city of Chicago from a Hispanic district with a majority of white women on an airplane were all clapping and celebrating because they felt a kinship with me and I was so thankful to them, for the gift that they gave me of their love, of their applause, and of their approval. We\u2019re each connecting with one another in ways we haven\u2019t ever before. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562520.625626}
