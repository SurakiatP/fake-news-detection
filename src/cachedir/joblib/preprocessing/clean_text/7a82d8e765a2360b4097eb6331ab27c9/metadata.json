C. known as the \u201cWomen\u2019s March on Washington. \u201d[Trump tweeted early Sunday morning:  Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn\u2019t these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly.  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017,  Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don\u2019t always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017,  According to NBC News, a Trump administration official noted about the   \u201cWomen\u2019s\u201d March that   women who had asked to partner with the march were refused. \u201cIf you want to come to the march you are coming with the understanding that you respect a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Linda Sarsour, a   Muslim racial justice and civil rights activist, and a chairwoman of the event, told the New York Times. \u201cThe organizers noted that their platform is   and they revoked partnership status\u2019 from   groups,\u201d the Trump official\u2019s comment continued. The news report noted the official also commented, that it was a \u201cshame\u201d that the March for Life next Friday \u201cwill not get anywhere near the same amount of coverage that this march got \u2014  and those   members were NOT welcome at the Women\u2019s March. \u201d NBC added: The comment also called out Madonna, one of many celebrities to speak at marches across the country, for telling crowds that she had \u201cthought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. \u201d \u201cComments like [Madonna\u2019s] are absolutely unacceptable and had they been said about President Obama, the mainstream media would be in an uproar,\u201d the official continued. \u201cThe Trump administration welcomes a robust discussion regarding the critical issues facing America\u2019s women and families. \u201d Students for Life of America (SFLA) the nation\u2019s largest organization of   youth attempted to partner with the march, but were told only   groups would be welcome, an action that ultimately revealed the main focus of the demonstration was to support abortion rights and fight the Trump administration\u2019s promise to defund Planned Parenthood if it continues to perform abortions. SFLA crashed the march in Washington anyway, carrying a banner that read, \u201cAbortion Betrays Women. \u201d The group posted on Facebook, \u201cWe will not sit by as Planned Parenthood, our nation\u2019s abortion Goliath and a sponsor of this March, betrays women into thinking abortion is their only choice. \u201d The  president of the   youth group, Kristan Hawkins, also said in a statement that the Women\u2019s March is \u201cexcluding the majority of American women who find abortion to be morally wrong and believe in protecting families, defending the marginalized, and achieving social justice. \u201d \u201cInstead of a march to promote those worthy values and truly be inclusive, the event has turned into a rallying cry for the radical abortion industry to save their own baby: taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood,\u201d she added.'"}, "time": 1742561855.8988087}
