A newborn kit is exceptionally underdeveloped, with sealed eyes and ears that won\u2019t open for five or six weeks, an age when puppies and kittens are ready to be weaned. A mother weasel, it seems, has no choice but to deliver her young  . As a member of the mustelid clan  \u2014   a noble but often misunderstood family of carnivorous mammals that includes ferrets, badgers, minks and wolverines  \u2014   she holds to a slender, elongated body plan, the better to pursue prey through tight spaces that most carnivores can\u2019t penetrate. Bulging baby bumps would jeopardize that sylphish hunting physique. The solution? Give birth to the equivalent of fetuses and then finish gestating them externally on mother\u2019s milk. \u201cIf you want access to small environments, you can\u2019t have a big belly,\u201d said William J. Zielinski, a mustelid researcher with the United States Forest Service in Arcata, Calif. \u201cYou don\u2019t see fat weasels. \u201d For Dr. Zielinski and other   scientists, weasels exemplify evolutionary genius and compromise in equal measure, the piecing together of exaggerated and often contradictory traits to yield a lineage of fierce, fleet,   carnivores that can compete for food against larger celebrity predators like the big cats, wolves and bears. Researchers admit that wild mustelids can be maddening to study. Most species are secretive loners, shrug off standard radio collars with ease, and run close to the ground \u201clike small bolts of brown lightning,\u201d as one team noted. Now you see them, no, you didn\u2019t. Nevertheless, through a mix of dogged field and laboratory studies, scientists have lately made progress in delineating the weasel playbook, and it\u2019s a page turner, or a page burner. Researchers have been astonished to discover that the average mustelid is like a   furnace, its metabolic rate exceeding not only that of other carnivorous mammals but also that of its twitchy,   rodent prey. \u201cIf you compare a least weasel to a meadow mouse, they\u2019re the same weight, but the weasel has the higher metabolic rate,\u201d said Roger Powell, an emeritus professor at North Carolina State University and doyen of weasel studies. \u201cThe weasel heart beats at up to 400 pulses per minute,\u201d said Mark Linnell, a faculty research assistant who studies mustelids at Oregon State University. \u201cThey\u2019re geared to run at full speed, and they\u2019re always  . \u201d That   metabolism is another example of a grand mustelidian compromise. \u201cIf you have a high metabolic rate, you can be more active and search farther for food in more places and in more diverse ways,\u201d Dr. Powell said. \u201cBut you have to catch more food in order to do that. \u201d Big cats must eat the equivalent of roughly a third of their weight each week weasels must eat a third or more of their weight each day. \u201cThey\u2019re living life on the edge,\u201d Dr. Powell said. Weasels also have big brains relative to body mass, and they apply their neuronal bounty to continuously   their movements during a hunt, a strategy that allows them to attack prey up to 10 times their size. The fisher, a particularly fearless weasel in the marten branch, may be the only North American carnivore to have mastered the art of dining on adult porcupine  \u2014   a large rodent that, in addition to being protected by a formidable quill sheath, weighs a good 12 pounds more than the   fisher. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be one of the great   matchups in history,\u201d said Roland Kays, a biologist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State. The fisher must encounter the porcupine on open ground, at which point it can start running circles around its quarry. The fisher tries to dart in and bite the porcupine\u2019s vulnerable face the porcupine pivots to turn its shielded back toward its attacker. Dart and spin, dart and bite. After several deep wounds to its face, the porcupine grows weak, loses its footing and  \u2014   match over. The fisher will then flip the punctured, pincushioned animal onto its back and carefully tear into a   patch of belly, gaining access to desirable organs like the small intestine, which is not only rich in protein and lipids, but also contains the partially digested plant matter that even carnivores need. Dr. Kays and a former student, Scott LaPoint, have found that fishers are far more behaviorally flexible than biologists had thought possible, at least in the Northeast. Hunted and trapped to near extinction until the 1930s, fishers  \u2014   a misleading name derived from Dutch colonists\u2019 word for polecat, a European weasel  \u2014   began recovering in their traditional setting of deep forests, where they could easily avoid humans. In the last few years, though, the weasels have apparently shaken off their reserve and begun showing up in suburban and urban areas  \u2014   a shopping mall in Schenectady, N. Y. a parking lot in downtown Albany. Two years ago, a sizable male fisher made its way to the Bronx, startling anybody who saw it slinking along the sidewalk and raising hope that a solution to the city\u2019s rat problem might have finally arrived. The fisher, alas, soon disappeared. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that one ended up in the Bronx in the first place,\u201d Dr. Powell said, \u201cbut it\u2019s no place for a fisher, and I\u2019m sure he wished he\u2019d turned left when he turned right. \u201d For their part, researchers wish they could overturn the public\u2019s generally poor opinion of weaseldom. To call someone a weasel means the person is shifty, untrustworthy. Weasel words are those squishy, defensive qualifiers beloved by, well, journalists. In a recent \u201cBrewster Rockit: Space Guy\u201d comic strip, a \u201ccloset of nightmares\u201d is opened to reveal, \u201cAAHHH! !!   clowns!\u201d Researchers speculate that the negative image may result partly from the mustelid\u2019s serpentine silhouette: In some parts of Central America, weasels are called \u201cfurry snakes. \u201d Or maybe it\u2019s the distinctive mustelid musk. Most weasel species communicate with one another over large home ranges through frequent daubs of a pungent fluid excreted by their anal glands. Shihab Shamma, who uses ferrets to study the mammalian auditory system at the University of Maryland and Descartes University in Paris, said of the ferrets at his Paris lab, \u201cWe give them the names of smelly French cheeses. \u201d But mustelid enthusiasts emphasize the family\u2019s beauty and diversity: some 60 living species across all continents except Antarctica and Australia, ranging in size from the least weasel, the world\u2019s smallest carnivore (weighing less than half a stick of butter as an adult) to the mighty wolverine, which can weigh up to 70 pounds. Many weasels spend time in water, and one species, the sea otter, is a marine mammal that rarely comes on land. Sea otters are also among the only nonprimate mammals to use tools, cracking open a recalcitrant mollusk shell by banging it with a stone. Most of the time, though, the sea otter\u2019s teeth do the job. \u201cTheir teeth are amazing, like no other living carnivore,\u201d said Adam   who studies mammalian bite forces at the University of South Carolina. \u201cThey\u2019re big and rounded and with no pointy cusps that might break off. They look like pillows or gum drops. \u201d But the teeth, with their thick coat of enamel, can easily crush open a crab, clam or snail. Most weasels have dentition more typical of carnivores, with a few sharp, slicing teeth and fewer, smaller molars, which other animals use to grind plants. As a result of their compact dental layout, many weasels have foreshortened snouts that make them look young and cute. They can also act young: Weasels are among the few animals that play as adults. If they\u2019re well fed, Dr. Powell said, \u201cthey\u2019ll bounce and ricochet around, pounce, stalk, wiggle and change shape and just about turn themselves inside out. They put kittens to shame. \u201d Many weasels live in cold places, and because their long, thin shape has a high surface area relative to volume, they lose heat easily. To tackle the cold without relying on fat as an insulator, many weasels grow luxurious fur coats, some of the densest in nature. A good head of human hair has about 350 hairs per square inch. On a mink, the fiber count per square inch is 44, 000. Small wonder that people have historically coveted weasel pelts  \u2014   mink, sable and ermine, the fur of pomp and royalty taken from the animals in winter, when their coats turn white. Weasels also appreciate the value of   fur. In winter, voles and mice build little   nests under the snow. When a weasel finds one of these nests, it\u2019s a genuine jackpot: lunch and lodging combined. Better still with a few tweaks: After eating the residents, the weasel lines its new dwelling in rodent fur to improve insulation. \u201cIf you pop open one of these nests in springtime, you discover a macabre scene,\u201d Dr. Zielinski said. \u201cWhat was once occupied by a vole is now covered with   wallpaper. \u201d A rodent\u2019s closet of nightmares: no clowns, no juggling, just one cold and hungry weasel, knocking at the door.'"}, "time": 1742563955.0990632}
