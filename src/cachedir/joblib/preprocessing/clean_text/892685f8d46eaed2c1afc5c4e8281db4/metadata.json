And he celebrated the Autopilot feature that made it possible for him to cruise the highways, making YouTube videos of himself driving  . In the first nine months he owned it, Mr. Brown put more than 45, 000 miles on the car. \u201cI do drive it a LOT,\u201d he wrote in response to one of the hundreds of viewer comments on one of his two dozen   videos. His postings attracted countless other Tesla enthusiasts, who tend to embrace the cars with an almost cultish devotion. They also tend to be people who like to live on technology\u2019s leading edge, which in Mr. Brown\u2019s case meant dismantling bombs for the Navy during the Iraq war, then coming home to start his own company to extend internet service into rural America. In his spare time he used a   printer to make model tanks and trucks. His Tesla, in other words, was simply one more extension of his   life. It took him on   adventures from the gravel driveway of the   clapboard house where he lived alone in Canton, an hour\u2019s drive south of Cleveland. But Mr. Brown became a victim of an innovation geared precisely to people like him when his Tesla Model S electric sedan collided with a semitrailer truck on a Florida highway in May, making him the first known fatality in a   car. \u201cHe liked it mainly because it was an exceptional use of technology, and Josh was very much an innovator,\u201d said his friend Paul Snow, who recalled how excited Mr. Brown was about his Tesla during a recent road trip. \u201cHe enjoyed the fact that technology was available, that it was being used to, ironically, increase safety on the roads. \u201d Tesla owners are a devoted bunch. Immediately after the company unveiled a prototype of its Model 3 car, more than 200, 000 enthusiasts put down deposits on the vehicles, which start at $35, 000 and will not be available until next year. Many owners like to showcase their cars on social media, creating songs, routines and other demonstrations of different features, particularly to show off how Autopilot works. Mr. Brown\u2019s most recent video was his most popular. Titled \u201cAutopilot Saves Model S,\u201d it shows Mr. Brown driving on an interstate highway from Cleveland to Canton. A white truck cuts in front of Mr. Brown\u2019s vehicle, and by his account, the Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature swerves the car to the right, avoiding a collision. After Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s founder, called attention to the video on Twitter, it went viral. Mr. Brown seemed to be elated. \u201cHe had said, \u2018For something to catch Elon Musk\u2019s eye, I can die and go to heaven now,\u2019\u201d said a neighbor, Krista Kitchen, choking up. \u201cHe was absolutely thrilled  \u2014   and then a couple weeks later he died. \u201d In a statement, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said preliminary reports indicated that the crash occurred when a   made a left turn in front of the Tesla, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The agency did not name the victim, but the Florida Highway Patrol identified him as Mr. Brown. Ms. Kitchen said Mr. Brown, 40, had just left a family trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando. His relatives did not respond to requests for comment. At Mr. Brown\u2019s house, behind an expansive,   lawn, a man who answered the door on Friday said the family did not wish to speak to reporters. Ms. Kitchen and others described how Mr. Brown would eagerly share his Tesla with friends, letting them take turns behind the wheel. And they described a man who was broadly generous with his time, who consistently helped friends in need, and who stayed in touch with his fellow veterans. \u201cHe was certainly an adventurer,\u201d Mr. Snow said. \u201cHe was a warrior that served proudly for his country he was a patriot. He did many things that had never been done before. \u201d Mr. Brown was particularly interested in testing the limits of the Autopilot function, documenting how the vehicle would react in blind spots, going around curves and other more challenging situations. \u201cThis section in here is going to be very, very difficult for the car to handle,\u201d he said in one video, posted in October, as his vehicle rounded a curve. \u201cWe\u2019re filming this just so you can see scenarios where the car does not do well. \u201d Mark Vernon, a high school classmate who recalled tinkering with electronics in shop class together, said that his friend showed off the   feature on a recent visit at Mr. Brown\u2019s home. \u201cHe knew the hill that it would give up on, because it couldn\u2019t see far enough,\u201d Mr. Vernon said. \u201cHe knew all the limitations that it would find and he really knew how it was supposed to work. \u201d Mr. Brown attended the University of New Mexico, where he studied physics and computer science, but did not graduate, the school said. Instead, he joined the Navy, where he served for more than a decade and specialized in disarming explosives, according to his company\u2019s website. His service included a stint with the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, commonly known as SEAL Team 6. Ricky Hammer, a retired Navy master chief who worked with Mr. Brown at the development group, said he had strong computer skills and \u201cwas the equivalent of an electrical engineer even though he didn\u2019t have the degree. \u201d Tesla owners tend to share a love of technology, and an eagerness to embrace the unknown, the untested or the unproven. Photos posted on Mr. Brown\u2019s Facebook page show a love of the outdoors, where he rappelled down cliffs and jumped out of airplanes for fun. One of those struck by Mr. Brown\u2019s adventurous side was Terri Lyn Reed, a senior insurance account executive who said she had helped Mr. Brown set up the insurance at his company, Nexu Innovations. \u201cHe\u2019d probably fly an   to   it,\u201d she said, referring to the military fighter jet. Tesla enthusiasts often also share a loyalty to the company, much the way Apple has engendered true believers whom it relies on to back the introduction of new iPhones, Macs and other products. Richard Henry, 26, who bought a 2015 Model S about nine months ago, uses Autopilot to take him through about 40 miles of freeway driving on each leg of his commute between San Francisco and Mountain View. When he started using his car\u2019s Autopilot mode, it had a tendency to lose track of the highway lines and tell him to take control. But in the last few months it has improved more and more. Most days he turns it on and sits with his hands on his knees  \u2014   ready to take the wheel, he pointed out. Learning about the technology and getting used to it has been \u201csuperfun,\u201d he said. That is a point that separates him from the many other drivers who tend to learn how to use a few necessary functions in their car and never bother with most others. \u201cI really like trying stuff like this out and understanding how the technology works,\u201d Mr. Henry said. Mr. Brown\u2019s enthusiasm for technology factored deeply into his work at Nexu, which specialized in setting up internet access in rural areas of the country where forests and mountains created special obstacles to entering the connected world. \u201cJosh knew how to get around all the interference from all the trees and all the hills,\u201d said Cindi Staneski, who runs the Hickory Run Campground in Denver, Pa. an   operation that became one of Mr. Brown\u2019s early clients. \u201cThe big companies wanted nothing to do with it,\u201d Ms. Staneski said, adding that Mr. Brown had become a mentor to her son. \u201cIt was too difficult, or they just wanted to charge you an extreme amount of money, whereas Josh felt that we deserved a chance that everybody else had. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563668.4972336}
