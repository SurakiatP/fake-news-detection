He went to check on his brothers and their children. They were struggling to breathe. He saw people fall in the street and begin foaming at the mouth before losing consciousness himself. Later, he found out his wife and babies had died. And he buried them. He walked through the graves, calling out the names of other family members who were also killed and buried in the graveyard, pausing at each, and sobbing. After the burial, \u201cI saw Ahmad and Aya, and carried them close to my heart,\u201d Mr.   said in the interview. \u201cWe buried them, I took Ahmad and Aya and buried them. I buried my own children. \u201d He said he had lost at least 25 members of his extended family in the attack.'"}, "time": 1742628596.8762293}
