In fact, once he gets going, he probably won\u2019t stop, given the amount of time he has spent in private processing his recent   irrelevance  \u2014   the \u201clean years,\u201d as he calls them. A generational guitar talent and reliable   hitmaker with seven Grammys, Mr. Mayer is also a master conversationalist prone to verbal solos, noodling in impressionistic bursts about his nature and career, weaving in   potential   bits and a barrage of mixed metaphors as if he\u2019s writing this story himself. That\u2019s what got him into trouble in the first place. \u201cThe elephant in the room is that we\u2019re sort of talking about the   dragon of the Rolling Stone interview and the Playboy interview,\u201d Mr. Mayer said a   into a monologue about why he left pop music\u2019s   and how ready he is, emotionally and musically, to return. Across four hectic days this month, as Mr. Mayer, lucid and optimistic, finished his   new album, \u201cThe Search for Everything,\u201d and filmed a music video for what he hopes will be his next hit single, he seemed to especially relish reflecting on his 2010 undoing. Recalling the consequences of those infamous magazine articles  \u2014   in which he used the phrase \u201csexual napalm,\u201d chronicled his onanism in horrific detail, referred to his male anatomy as David Duke and somehow separately used a racial epithet  \u2014   Mr. Mayer was vivid and virtuosic in his  . \u201cWhat has to happen for a guy to believe that he\u2019s totally   and be that far out of touch?\u201d he said. \u201cMy GPS was shattered, just shattered. \u201d At 32 and obsessed with outsmarting the idea of a \u201cclich\u00e9d rock star,\u201d he explained, \u201cI started to invent my own grenade. \u201d (His big mouth.) He was \u201ca Mack Truck without brakes. \u201d Tabloid fame was \u201ca   hormone\u201d and \u201cextracurricular stuff\u201d anyway, Mr. Mayer said. \u201cI basically realized I\u2019m no good at that, so I\u2019m going to drop that major. \u201d Also: \u201cWhat I did was probably semiconsciously just reboot it  \u2014   control, alt, delete. \u201d \u201cIt was an induced coma. \u201d His career had \u201cflatlined. \u201d \u201cIt was cat and mouse,\u201d he said, \u201cand the mouse lost. \u201d Now approaching 40, \u201cI\u2019m old enough to look back on my life and go: \u2018That\u2019s probably the photonegative shot in \u2018Behind the Music,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mayer said. \u201cComing up after the break  \u2014   boom  \u2014   the downfall. \u201d In reality, after those turbulent moments he moved to Montana, grew out his hair and made two more   albums  \u2014   \u201cBorn and Raised\u201d and \u201cParadise Valley\u201d  \u2014   that were less \u201cYour Body Is a Wonderland\u201d and more Laurel Canyon. \u201cIt\u2019s rivers and cows,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sexuality there. \u201d The relatively modest sales reflected that. But the exile couldn\u2019t last, not for this restless   with the baby face and a penchant for dating some of the most famous women in the world (Jennifer Aniston, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry). In late 2014, as he began writing what would become \u201cThe Search for Everything,\u201d out April 14, Mr. Mayer realized: \u201cI\u2019m a young guy. I like girls. I want girls to like me. I want to make music and be thought of as attractive. I was finally ready to   that world and grow back into it. \u201d He thought a lot about George Clooney. \u201cThere\u2019s a guy who can make art house films and then just decide that he\u2019s going to be in a blockbuster,\u201d Mr. Mayer said. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, O. K. I\u2019m going to basically come out of retirement from blockbusters. It\u2019s a choice to write pop songs, just like it\u2019s a choice to write blues songs or folk songs. Let\u2019s write the big ones that we are capable of writing. \u201d And that\u2019s how John Mayer ended up dancing with pandas. In sweats at a Hollywood soundstage, Mr. Mayer was quick to pick up the choreography for the ensemble number that would be the centerpiece for his new video. The song, \u201cStill Feel Like Your Man,\u201d is throwback for him: a wistful but upbeat breakup ditty that, like much of his new music, \u201cmoves and throbs and has women in it again,\u201d Mr. Mayer said. It\u2019s also pretty plainly about missing his most recent ex, Ms. Perry, a fact that he acknowledged might get the tabloids chirping again. \u201cWho else would I be thinking about?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, it\u2019s a testament to the fact that I have not dated a lot of people in the last five, six years. That was my only relationship. So it\u2019s like, give me this, people. \u201d For the video, Mr. Mayer wanted to think big, giving the track the best chance to succeed as a single. The syncopation of the guitar riff, he said, reminded him of \u201cancient Japanese RB\u201d  \u2014   which he acknowledged \u201cisn\u2019t a thing\u201d  \u2014   so the video concept followed suit. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna ever roll around in bedsheets again,\u201d Mr. Mayer added. On set the next day, there was a makeshift bamboo forest, a woman in full geisha garb and two people in giant panda suits, making up a bizarre tableau that Mr. Mayer called a \u201cdisco dojo. \u201d Yet for someone so attuned to the risk of offending people again  \u2014   \u201cI have nightmares about a second occurrence of\u201d the Playboy era, he said  \u2014   Mr. Mayer seemed sanguine about the possibility of a controversy over cultural appropriation, an issue that has dogged other pop stars. \u201cI think we were as sensitive as we could possibly be,\u201d he said over burgers at the Polo Lounge the day after the video shoot. \u201cIt was discussed at every juncture. \u201d \u201cPart of cultural appropriation is blindness,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m on the right side of the line because it\u2019s an idea for the video that has a very multiethnic casting, and nobody who is white or   is playing an Asian person. \u201d The video\u2019s director, who goes by Mister Whitmore, said he and Mr. Mayer \u201cthought long and hard about how to approach\u201d the \u201cfantasy element\u201d of the concept without offending. \u201cI hope there\u2019s an understanding that we were sensitive to it,\u201d he said. Still, Mr. Mayer acknowledged the current discourse. \u201cDo I think that someone is going to tweet that this is cultural appropriation? Yes,\u201d Mr. Mayer, an internet obsessive, said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting to see. \u201d (And then there\u2019s the dancing.) The song\u2019s commercial prospects are a separate concern. In Mr. Mayer\u2019s absence from the Top 40, guitars have been further silenced by electronics. Even Ed Sheeran and Shawn Mendes, Mr. Mayer\u2019s direct descendants, work with pop songwriting teams and cover rap tracks. \u201cI do a thing  \u2014   I have sensibilities,\u201d said Mr. Mayer, who has often found himself overcompensating for his pristine but often edgeless bluesy pop and coffeehouse soul. \u201cMy instincts as a musician are not exactly my instincts as a listener or a member of the world. But I believe that I am successful because I obey them. \u201d He added: \u201cThe only hits I\u2019ll have left in my life  \u2014   because there are great hit writers, but I will not go into a room with them  \u2014   are luck songs. My record has one name in the parentheses on every song, and it\u2019s my name. That\u2019s important. \u201d Writing \u201cThe Search for Everything,\u201d which was released in two   \u201cwaves\u201d before its final iteration to better suit the streaming era, proved spiritually purifying for Mr. Mayer, he said. \u201cThis was the only time in my life that I was making something that I could live inside of. I\u2019ve built a home because I needed a place to stay, not because I was into selling homes. \u201d While it began as a breakup album, with songs like \u201cMoving On and Getting Over\u201d and \u201cNever on the Day You Leave,\u201d it quickly transcended that. \u201cThere were times when tears came out of me, and I went, O. K. John, this is not about an     relationship. This is something more profound. \u201d In the last six months or so, completing the record coincided with the flipping of a biological switch  \u2014   he called it \u201ca chemical care package\u201d  \u2014   for Mr. Mayer, who recently became an uncle for the first time: He really does want to settle down. \u201cThat\u2019s the final frontier, man. \u201d But as he approaches a milestone birthday, \u201cI wish there was somebody to throw me the 40th,\u201d Mr. Mayer said, leaning into his corniness. \u201cI want the baby with the protective earphones\u201d by the side of the stage. He\u2019s even been living out of a hotel for fear of establishing another bachelor pad. \u201cI want to say, \u2018We\u2019ll take it,\u2019\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m right on time for my career, and I\u2019m running late for my life. \u201d It\u2019s a process. Though he\u2019s been in therapy to work on his \u201cattachment style\u201d and recently quit drinking (\u201cI\u2019m actually very thoughtfully entering cannabis life\u201d) Mr. Mayer is wary that his notoriety as a womanizer precedes him. \u201cI\u2019ve inherited a younger man\u2019s reputation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even break \u2018bad boy\u2019 into good bad boy and bad bad boy  \u2014   I somehow managed to become a bad version of a bad boy. \u201d Since splitting with Ms. Perry, he\u2019s hardly been out at all, he insisted, though he does fiddle around on an exclusive dating app. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of chatter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all talk to the same people. There are very few people actually meeting up. \u201d Another hurdle is that he will be on tour most of the year, headlining arenas in support of the album  \u2014   he plays Madison Square Garden on April 5  \u2014   plus a jaunt with his side gig, Dead  Company, where he plays guitar alongside members of the Grateful Dead. (\u201cThe feeling of inclusion that I have with this band  \u2014   they saved my life,\u201d he said.) The itinerant lifestyle, though, is less fraught than whatever lurks in the   recesses of Mr. Mayer\u2019s soul, depths he is beyond game to probe and excavate. \u201cIn the Blood,\u201d the most fully formed, Tom   track from \u201cThe Search for Everything,\u201d is a sort of   with Mr. Mayer singing big questions with no answers: \u201cIt\u2019s not pretty, those words,\u201d Mr. Mayer said in the studio as he worked on final touches. \u201cBut the one thing I look forward to the most as I   this level of the music world is I really want to experience saying something that I can defend no matter what. \u201cIt\u2019s like: \u2018John, they\u2019re gonna come after you. They\u2019re going to ask about it,\u2019\u201d he said with a cackle. \u201cI say, \u2018Let \u2018em. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563841.3326805}
