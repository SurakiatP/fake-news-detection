Since the lofty idealism of the 1960s, the goal of making college affordable for all Californians has been in dogged decline. Tuition at both the University of California and California State systems has tripled over the last 15 years. And now, leaders of both institutions are pondering another increase. The result, according to a new survey, is that many Californians no longer see a path into public higher education. The study by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 85 percent of Californians surveyed now think that tuition costs at the state\u2019s public colleges and universities present a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s not about quality,\u201d said Mark Baldassare, the president of the nonprofit research group. \u201cIt\u2019s about affordability. \u201d To critics, the worries are more evidence of a betrayal of mission enshrined in California\u2019s higher education system: that any resident who worked hard enough would be guaranteed a   university education. At the moment, the University of California\u2019s undergraduate tuition and fees are roughly $13, 500 a year, well above the national average for public universities. At Cal State, about $6, 900. A University of California spokesman, Ricardo Vazquez, noted that the Public Policy Institute survey showed that a wide majority of Californians judged the quality of instruction at the state\u2019s public colleges and universities favorably. But, he added in a statement, \u201cThe findings also show that Californians are aware and concerned, as is U. C. that public higher education in the state is severely underfunded. \u201d According to the University of California, the system relied on state funding for nearly a quarter of its budget as recently as 2002. That figure is now about 10 percent, after more than $1 billion in cuts. Still, representatives of both Cal State and the University of California said that the tuition of a majority of their students was fully covered by financial aid. The costs of transportation, textbooks and housing, however, are another matter. University students have reported struggles with soaring housing costs in the areas surrounding many of the campuses, in places like Irvine, Santa Barbara and Berkeley. In July, a survey found that one in five University of California students sometimes went hungry. A study this year by the Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that even after subtracting aid,   students in both the Cal State and University of California systems had to come up with as much as $13, 000 a year. \u201cAnd by low income, I mean with a family income that\u2019s under $30, 000,\u201d said Debbie Cochrane, vice president at the organization. \u201cSo, that is a hefty price tag. \u201d The Times is doing something new: Our reporters who are investigating the Oakland warehouse fire will be providing regular updates on their findings.

Instead, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival became one of the more notorious days in rock history. It was this week in 1969 that the Bay Area concert headlined by the Rolling Stones descended into mayhem as Hells Angels beat dozens of concertgoers and, in one case, stabbed an    to death within 20 feet of the stage. Organizers had wanted to host the concert, which was also to feature the    Grateful Dead, among other acts, at San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park. But the plans fell apart. At the last minute, Dick Carter, the owner of Altamont, offered his raceway in the city of Livermore. A rambling army of hippies  \u2014   estimated at more than 300, 000  \u2014   swept into the outdoor site. According to Joel Selvin, author of \u201cAltamont: The Rolling Stones, the Hells Angels, and the Inside Story of Rock\u2019s Darkest Day,\u201d the planning was a debacle. Nobody was in charge, he said. There was no water or food concessions and too few toilets. Bad acid was everywhere. The Hells Angels had been enlisted to handle security. One of the motorcycle club\u2019s primary duties: Keep fans a safe distance from the stage. Armed with pool cues, the bikers whacked and punched concertgoers. Briefed about the degenerating situation, the Dead refused to play. But the Stones went ahead. As scuffles broke out during their set, Mick Jagger pleaded for calm: \u201cCome on now. That means everybody just cool out!\u201d Then, for reasons uncertain to this day, Meredith Hunter, a black man dressed in a lime green suit, pulled a revolver near the stage. He was swiftly stabbed by a Hells Angel and pummeled by others, killing him. The stabbing was captured by filmmakers who made it a central scene in a documentary about the Stones called \u201cGimme Shelter. \u201d (Alan Passaro, the Angel who wielded the knife, was later indicted on a charge of murder but acquitted by a jury on grounds of  .) Altamont ultimately became a shorthand in the larger culture for the hippie movement\u2019s dark underbelly. The episode did not spell the end of the counterculture, said Mr. Selvin, the author. \u201cBut it was a terrible loss of innocence. \u201d California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
