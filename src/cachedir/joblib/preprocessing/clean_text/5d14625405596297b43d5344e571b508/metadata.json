[The number of customers for the tattoo removal business has doubled as some in the Latino community in San Pablo worry that immigration agents will use their tattoos as an excuse to ask about immigration status, KPIX reported.  People normally come to the business to get tattoos removed for job interviews, or to get rid of an  \u2019s name, but the clinic says deportation is a new reason. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t want to be a moving target or even seen as a target,\u201d says Nora Ruiz of the San Pablo Economic Development Corporation. \u201cAnd for fear that they might be seen as a certain type of person or judged in any way, people want to get their tattoos removed. \u201d There is no evidence that those with tattoos are being singled out by immigration officials, but people with criminal backgrounds or gang ties could be at risk. Immigrants are also canceling their food stamps and foregoing doctor visits over fears immigration agents will use the records kept with agencies or doctor\u2019s offices to track them down and deport them.'"}, "time": 1742628519.8169065}
