Nearly a million people watched the giant berry burst on Facebook Live. It racked up more than 10 million views in the days that followed. Traditional journalists everywhere saw themselves as the seeds, flying out of the frame. How do we compete with that? And if that\u2019s the future of news and information, what\u2019s next for our democracy? President Kardashian? Grandkids: It was not so long ago  \u2014   oh, say, five, maybe six years  \u2014   that traditional news organizations like this one could laugh at BuzzFeed\u2019s gag along with everyone else, smugly secure. An exploding watermelon was just an exploding watermelon. These days, however, news articles  \u2014   be they about war, voting rights, the arts or immigration policy  \u2014   increasingly inhabit social media feeds like the frighteningly dominant one that Facebook runs. They are competing for attention against zany kitchen experiments your friend\u2019s daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah and that wild video of a train whipping through a ridiculously narrow alleyway in Thailand. After watching the fruiticide, I noticed a Twitter post by the freelance journalist Erik Malinowski that read, \u201cthe watermelon   \u2026     is us,\u201d and sighed. Seemed about right. The sense of dread was compounded a few hours later, when the website Mashable, which first came to prominence covering Internet businesses and culture, appeared to pare back an ambitious effort to prove that serious world and political news could thrive alongside \u201cGrumpy Cat. \u201d Mashable announced that as part of a reorganization it was shedding several highly regarded journalists, including its executive editor, Jim Roberts, a former assistant managing editor at The New York Times. Look out, White House, I thought, here comes Kimye. Then, sweet relief (or was it? ): The Financial Times reported that BuzzFeed  \u2014   which is best known for hits like the watermelon video, though its news team wins awards  \u2014   missed its financial targets last year and was revising this year\u2019s projections downward. BuzzFeed, which does not disclose its finances, denied the report, saying this year will meet expectations. But traditional newsrooms everywhere were reveling in the schadenfreude just the same. Aha! Perhaps random snapshots of callipygian Corgis do not a business model make news as we know it is safe. Well, not really. We may not yet be the watermelon. But executives who run news organizations almost universally say that we\u2019d all better find our own watermelons  \u2014   and find them yesterday. It means big changes are coming fast in the way major news institutions present their journalism, what that journalism includes, and how decisions are made about what to include. The goal: to draw big, addicted audiences. A lot of it is being done in the rushed panic that comes with the demands of quarterly earnings. And yet, given the highest calling of the news industry  \u2014   hold politicians to account, unearth corruption  \u2014   the importance to our political and civic life could not be greater. A good way to understand the   thinking is to check in on people who are trying to build a news and information business from scratch. I did that last week over breakfast with Jim VandeHei, a   of Politico, and Mike Allen, one of the site\u2019s   journalists. Both are also veterans of The Washington Post. Mr. VandeHei, who stepped down last week as Politico\u2019s chief executive, and Roy Schwartz, the company\u2019s departing chief revenue officer, have been seeking potential investors and video and television partners. Mr. Allen is for the time being continuing to write his vital morning tip sheet at Politico, \u201cPlaybook,\u201d seven days a week. When I met with Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Allen, they were   about their next venture. They would only describe it in the broadest terms, as \u201ca media company\u201d that will focus on news and information, exist largely on mobile devices and social media, and not directly compete against Politico. But that was O. K. for my purposes. I was more interested in hearing what this venture wouldn\u2019t be doing. Their answers may require a trigger warning for the proudly   set. It starts with Mr. VandeHei\u2019s admittedly provocative proposition that \u201cjournalists are killing journalism. \u201d They\u2019re doing this, he says, by \u201cstubbornly clinging to the old ways. \u201d That\u2019s defined as producing 50 competing but nearly identical stories about a presidential candidate\u2019s latest speech, or   updates on the transportation budget negotiations. Survival, Mr. VandeHei says, depends on giving readers what they really want, how they want it, when they want it, and on not spending too much money producing what they don\u2019t want. It\u2019s not only about creating big audiences for advertisers, he and Mr. Allen said. It\u2019s about convincing   audiences that they want what you\u2019re producing, and they want it so badly that they will pay for it through subscriptions. That\u2019s essential as advertising revenue drops to levels that will not support robust news gathering. Hooking people on your news product is a lot harder than, say, hooking them on heroin or even coffee. But news organizations have ways they never had before to figure it out. Through   analytics, reporters and editors know how many people are reading their work and through which devices and sites, how long those readers are sticking with it, and what they\u2019re ignoring. Screens featuring these analytics are increasingly showing up, prominently, in American newsrooms, including those of The New York Times and The Washington Post. This is the biggest and least talked about development in traditional print media as it converts to digital: It now has ratings, just as television does. The findings from these ratings have been fairly consistent. Videos, podcasts, short items of interest that can be read easily on smartphones, and almost anything with the words \u201cDonald Trump\u201d rate well. Perhaps counterintuitively, deeply reported features and investigative pieces like The Times\u2019s coverage of ISIS\u2019 brutality or its nearly   article about one man\u2019s lonely death in Queens can draw readership levels that were never possible in the   era. That\u2019s a big deal, and in Mr. VandeHei\u2019s and Mr. Allen\u2019s view  \u2014   as well as those of the bosses at The Times, The Post and elsewhere  \u2014   it shows that big, important work will prove more valuable than fun stunts that may or may not draw big online audiences. What do not necessarily rate well, however, are the (often important if sometimes unsexy) articles about yesterday\u2019s doings  \u2014   or, nondoings  \u2014   at the Federal Election Commission, or the latest federal budget fight. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if, in a newspaper, people were reading our   piece on the transportation markup on A10  \u2014   now we do,\u201d Mr. VandeHei said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you let the audience dictate everything, but a smart, aggressive,   media company is going to write what it thinks is important and its audience thinks is important. \u201d This is talk you hear in newsrooms across the country, and it\u2019s where there is some cause for concern. Those drier articles may not score in the ratings, but they can lead to the bigger ones. Watergate started as a story about a burglary. The   sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church that The Boston Globe exposed  \u2014   captured in the movie \u201cSpotlight\u201d  \u2014   began as a   column about a single priest. Once ratings come into the picture, will reporters still want to pursue those smaller stories? And will their editors, who once called these stories \u201cspinach,\u201d want to publish them? The answer from Mr. VandeHei and   news executives is yes, but it\u2019s incumbent upon news organizations to do a better job with them  \u2014   make them shorter and more distinctive, with data and striking visual presentation. Understood. All I\u2019m asking is that we be careful not to lose too many core values on our way to the future. Otherwise, it\u2019s watermelon flamb\u00e9 at the Kardashian inauguration, and yes, we\u2019re the watermelon.'"}, "time": 1742563403.623659}
