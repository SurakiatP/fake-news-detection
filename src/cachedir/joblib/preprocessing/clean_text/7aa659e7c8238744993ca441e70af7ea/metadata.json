We\u2019re also doing something new: providing regular updates on our findings. Do you have information, advice or feedback? Send email to oaklandfire@nytimes. com.  The first update can be found here. Among the targets of our reporting is finding out about the owner of the sprawling warehouse that burst into flames on Dec. 2. Property records show that her name is Chor Nar Siu Ng and that she bought the building in 1988. Did Ms. Ng know anything about the dangers at the Ghost Ship? And if so, what did she do to fix them? For the past week, I\u2019ve been trying to learn more about Ms. Ng, combing through records at the Alameda County  \u2019s office, interviewing people all over Oakland\u2019s Chinatown  \u2014   where she owns several properties  \u2014   and trying to track down her children, who helped her run her businesses. So far, no one has found her. (The Los Angeles Times did speak with her daughter, Eva Ng, who said the family hadn\u2019t known that anyone lived at the Ghost Ship.) Through documents and interviews, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned about Chor Nar Siu Ng: \u2022 First, Ms. Ng owns several properties in the Bay Area  \u2014   roughly 10  \u2014   most of which are in Oakland. She owns the warehouse that burned, at 1315 31st Avenue, as well as an adjacent lot to the south and an adjacent building to the north. That building houses a Boost Mobile store, a boutique called Moda and a   religious goods shop called Botanica 3 MMM. \u2022 Second, the city has spent years fining Ms. Ng for what it calls \u201cnuisance or substandard or hazardous or injurious\u201d conditions at the lot south of the warehouse and at the building to the north. While it\u2019s difficult to determine exactly how much Ms. Ng has paid because of these conditions, tax records offer a clue: Between 2005 and 2014, Ms. Ng paid $26, 570. 20 in \u201ccode enforcement\u201d fees to the city of Oakland for the lot next to the Ghost Ship. I\u2019ve reached out to the city to ask about the specifics of what led to these fines. Messages were also left with two of Ms. Ng\u2019s children, as well as with a lawyer named Gerard Lam, who represented Ms. Ng in a previous dispute with a tenant. There\u2019s been no response yet. \u2022 Third, it\u2019s clear that Ms. Ng had at least some presence in the warehouse area. Several people who used to live at the Ghost Ship have said Ms. Ng or her daughter would come by the warehouse, first alerting Derick Ion Almena, the man who rented the place from them. What\u2019s not clear is whether the Ngs entered the building and saw what was inside: a   staircase, a blocked exit upstairs, webs of extension cords, propane tanks used to heat water and piles of flammable debris. Now that it\u2019s evident that Ms. Ng has a string of properties around the city, it will be important to try to find her tenants. What did they think of how she ran her buildings? Did they feel safe? For about 20 years, Griselda Ceja and her family rented a portion of the building next to the burned warehouse. From there, Ms. Ceja ran a beauty salon she called Griselda\u2019s. (The salon is still listed on Google Maps.) \u201cShe never took care of the building,\u201d Ms. Ceja said. \u201cWe were scared. We were all scared. \u201d Ms. Ceja, 43, described troubling conditions: a circuit box and light fixtures that sparked as she dried customers\u2019 hair. A blocked emergency exit. An aged electric system that failed constantly. There were also rats in the walls and holes in the floors. She wanted to go elsewhere but couldn\u2019t afford to, she said. Ms. Ceja said she complained frequently to Ms. Ng and her relatives, communicating through letters, phone calls and text messages. After about a year, Ms. Ceja said, the Ngs added a second circuit box, an effort to stop the sparking. Ms. Ceja said she called the city once, about a decade ago, to complain about the rats. She said an Oakland official came by, but she didn\u2019t press him to take action. \u201cHe said the building would close if he did something about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand everyone would go out of business. \u201d A request has been sent to the city for documents that would confirm this. Ms. Ceja suggested talking to Leo Barrera, who had worked with her at the salon, to verify her account. \u201cWe told them many times: \u2018Please, if you could fix this, we need light, or water, or an emergency exit,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barrera, 36, said at her new beauty shop. \u201cThe most basic. Nothing more. We weren\u2019t asking for luxuries,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the case that the building caught on fire,\u201d she added, \u201chow would we have exited?\u201d Did everyone have such problems? On Friday, I went to Chinatown, where at least three properties are in Ms. Ng\u2019s name. Michelle Leung, a student at the University of California, Berkeley, who speaks Cantonese, came along to interpret. At a grocery, a Vietnamese restaurant and a building that houses the California Chinese Orchestra, no one knew her. But at Sum Yee Pastry, the owner  \u2014   a man who would not give his name  \u2014   said his family had rented from Ms. Ng for a decade. No major problems, he said, just a few leaks, which he fixed himself. Later, back at the scene of the fire, a woman named Rose Martinez, 31, was standing outside Botanica 3 MMM near tears. Her family started the business about 20 years ago, she said. The fire had caused considerable water and smoke damage, and the business is now closed. The Ngs had been good to them, she said, even letting the family skip rent one month after her father died. But the faulty electricity and the rats had been a real problem, Ms. Martinez said. Of the fire, she said, \u201closswise, I don\u2019t know how to put it into words. \u201d WHAT\u2019S NEXT: I\u2019d like to speak with the Ngs, with any of their business associates, and with people who have lived and worked at their properties, as well as with more residents of the Ghost Ship. How often did they see Ms. Ng or her family members at the warehouse? And it\u2019s important to hear from city officials about their interactions with the landlord. Lastly, all of this is a part of a larger question: Who will ultimately be held legally responsible for the fire? Could lawyers who\u2019ve worked on other cases involving major fires provide any advice? P. S.: Readers, I want to know when the warehouse at 1315 31st Avenue was built and what it had been in past years. A canning factory? A dairy? The Oakland History Room, the Oakland Heritage Survey and the University of California\u2019s Earth Sciences and Map Library have all provided some clues, but nothing definitive so far. Suggestions?  \u2014   JULIE TURKEWITZ When we took on this project last week, we hoped for feedback from readers. What we got was well beyond our expectations: a torrent of tips, expertise, links to documents and anguished readers describing their experiences with the housing crisis in the Bay Area. Architects, fire marshals, lawyers, artists and concerned residents were among the hundreds of readers who wrote us, creating a trove of contacts for the reporters working on the project. Janet Van Ham, a photographer, wrote to describe precarious spaces that she has rented in Oakland. When I called Ms. Van Ham to follow up, she said she had an epiphany over the summer at her   loft in an old warehouse. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018If there was a fire in here, how would I get out? \u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no safety plan, no enforcement. \u201d She moved out in August. Serena Elston, a carpenter and wood sculptor who lives in a loft in Fruitvale, the neighborhood where the Ghost Ship is, wrote about the plight of artists and the powerful but intangible sense of community in Oakland among them. I drove to Ms. Elston\u2019s   converted warehouse with Jim Wilson, our San Francisco bureau photographer. Ms. Elston\u2019s studio, filled with power saws and timber, has a sprinkler system. But we spoke about the many other people in Oakland who live more precariously. \u201cIt\u2019s a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell situation,\u201d Ms. Elston said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you know your electrical system is super messed up. Are you going to call your landlord in? Is he going to fix it or kick you out?\u201d We are grateful to all those who wrote, and we welcome more information as we continue the project.  \u2014   THOMAS FULLER'"}, "time": 1742563284.7058206}
