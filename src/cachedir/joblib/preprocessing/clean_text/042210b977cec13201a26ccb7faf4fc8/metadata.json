Today, we\u2019ll talk about some of these non-election-related events on Survival Saturday, like the Dakota access pipeline, Russia, Venezuela, and our dystopian future. \\nFor election coverage, go on over to my other website, DaisyLuther.com , which is all Hillary, all the time, right up until the election. (My goal there is to cover the stuff that the MSM is trying to sweep under the rug about their darling.) The Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Are Being Brutally Attacked by Law Enforcement \\nHave you been aware of the ongoing protests by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe about a pipeline being forcibly built across their watershed via eminent domain? They have been joined by other tribes to form a coalition of water protectors who say that the pipeline is a violation of a treaty established between the Sioux and the federal government. ( Here are the important things to know about the protest . Trust me, you\u2019ll want to read this.) \\nEveryone who was paying attention breathed a sigh of relief when the US Government for once took a stand on behalf of the little guys back in September. \\n\u201cThe federal government ordered a halt to work on a $3.8 billion four-state oil pipeline in the Upper Midwest on Friday, handing a temporary victory to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other opponents of the project\u2026 \\n\u2026The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it wouldn\u2019t authorize construction near Lake Oahe, a culturally important location to the tribe, until the agency determines if it needs to reconsider its previous approvals under the National Environmental Policy Act.\u201d ( source ) \\nUnfortunately, the government\u2019s willingness to do the right thing was short-lived. Work has resumed on the pipeline and all hell is breaking loose \u2013 but not by who you might think. Protestors have been non-violent, but law enforcement has been absolutely brutal. They\u2019ve beaten up on young people, old people, and independent journalists covering the story. Hundreds have been arrested. \\nThese people are protecting their water sources and their way of life, and they are being brutalized by our own government. The story you\u2019re getting on the mainstream is that the water protectors are standing there and that the police are standing there and that it is a relatively calm affair. \\nThat couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. The AntiMedia (who would get a major journalism award if real journalists got such awards) has provided truthful coverage, and it is ugly. Every single person who is against government overreach should be supporting the water protectors. Right now, this affects some people up in North Dakota. But what about when someone wants to build something across your land? What about when someone wants to seize your home? What about when Agenda 21 comes to your back yard? \\nHere\u2019s what really happened at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests . It\u2019s on film. It\u2019s ugly. You owe it to your fellow human beings to witness this and be outraged. Go here to learn what you can do to help . With all of this \u201cprogress,\u201d is humanity at risk of becoming obsolete? \\nThousands of jobs each year are being turned over to computers as humans demand higher wages and better benefits for unskilled labor. We\u2019ve all ended up on the endless loop of talking to customer service robots on the phone or going to a checkout counter and discovering it is push button and digital. \\nIs this all part of a greater plan to make the bulk of humanity utterly dependent on the whims of a few? \\nI don\u2019t watch a lot of documentaries, but last night my daughter and I watched Obsolete . This film is available for free on Amazon , and it isn\u2019t one of those dry, boring ones that keep you shifting in your seat in order to stay awake. It\u2019s fascinating from the moment you hit play. When it was over, we sat there in silence for at least a minute, aghast that we could see the whole thing happening around us right now. \\nI can\u2019t recommend this highly enough. Everyone should watch it. Let me quote Morpheus (from the Matrix ) for a moment here. \u201cThis is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill\u2014the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill\u2014you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I\u2019m offering is the truth. Nothing more.\u201d \\nThis documentary is the red pill. Take it if you want to survive the future that is coming for us all. \\nWatch Obsolete then come back over here and let\u2019s talk about it. I think this will spark a very interesting conversation. How will you prepare for a future in which humanity is largely obsolete? Meanwhile in Venezuela\u2026 \\nThings are still awful there, although there hasn\u2019t been as much news coverage. Basically, this is how life is now for Venezuelans, and recovering from this collapse could take decades. \\nCurrently, the people of the country are revolting against the unpopular president, Nicholas Maduro. A campaign had begun for a recall election in order to replace Maduro, but authorities halted the process. The electoral council cited fraud when faced with huge numbers of signatures on a petition. Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets. Source: Federico Parra /AFP/Getty Images \\nNPR reports : \\nThe demonstrators were protesting \u201cwhat they call a sharp turn towards authoritarianism. The Maduro government has jailed opposition leaders, stripped Congress of its powers and cracked down on the press.\u201d \\nAs for Maduro, he has blatantly threatened to jail anyone who tries to remove him from power, via elections or legal means, ironically citing the Venezuelan constitution : \\n\u201cIf they launch a supposed political trial, which is not in our constitution, the state prosecution service must bring legal action in the courts and put in jail anyone who violates the constitution, even if they are members of Congress.\u201d \\nWhat\u2019s more, in a conversation with the American DEA, Maduro\u2019s nephew says that Venezuela is at war with the US, which is news to most Americans. Efrain Campo was busted doing a quick cocaine deal in order to make money for the Venezuelan First Family. He was caught attempting to smuggle $5 million of Columbian cocaine into the US. The Charlotte Observer reported : \\nEfrain Campo\u2026was recorded saying \u201cwe\u2019re at war\u201d with the Americans and laughing about sending opposition leaders to jail, according to the transcript, which was filed in federal district court in New York. \\n\u201cWe need the money,\u201d Campo said, according to the transcript. \u201cWhy? Because the Americans are hitting us hard with money. Do you understand? The opposition . . . is getting an infusion of a lot of money.\u201d \\n\u2026The defense has sought to paint Campo and his cousin as victims of a U.S. political plot against the Venezuelan government and has asserted that they didn\u2019t have the knowledge or capability to pull off such a complicated transaction. We\u2019re irritating the snot out of Russia\u2026 \\nLately, the Powers That Shouldn\u2019t Be (great phrase borrowed from my friend Mel at Truthstream Media ) have been going out of their way to paint Russia and Vladimir Putin as the biggest threat to America. A bigger threat, even, than Hillary Clinton, and boy, that\u2019s a stretch. I\u2019m pretty sure you can put all of these recent headlines together and get a picture of where this is headed. ( Hint .) There are many more, but I don\u2019t want this post to be a lengthy novel about idiocy.'"}, "time": 1742561851.0689604}
