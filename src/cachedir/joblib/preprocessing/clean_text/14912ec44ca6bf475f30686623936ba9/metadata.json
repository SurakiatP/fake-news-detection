They sort of are. The puppets  \u2014   animated and voiced by skilled puppeteers  \u2014   star alongside Ms. Andrews in \u201cJulie\u2019s Greenroom,\u201d a new children\u2019s show produced by the Henson Company and available on Netflix beginning March 17. She was particularly partial to Hugo the Duck, a character she created, stroking his feather head until her daughter gently chided her. \u201cMom, you shouldn\u2019t keep touching him,\u201d Ms. Hamilton said. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to get oil on them. \u201d Ms. Andrews quickly apologized. \u201cI just wanted to lift his feathers up a bit,\u201d she said. Ms. Andrews, an     and   actress who is as warm and forthright in person as anyone who grew up loving \u201cMary Poppins\u201d would expect her to be, has worked with puppets before. As a child actress in England, she serenaded a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy in \u201cEducating Archie,\u201d a popular radio show. In \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d she yodeled with marionettes. And on \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cThe Muppet Show,\u201d she vamped with their   denizens. The difference now? She helped bring these latest puppets into existence. Besides starring in \u201cJulie\u2019s Greenroom,\u201d Ms. Andrews helped create, write and produce the show with Ms. Hamilton and Judy Rothman Rof\u00e9, an   writer on \u201cMadeline\u201d and other kids\u2019 programs. On the show, she plays Ms. Julie, who teaches a performing arts class to five puppet pupils. Over the debut season\u2019s 13 episodes, Ms. Julie and celebrity guests (including Alec Baldwin, Idina Menzel, Josh Groban, Carol Burnett and David Hyde Pierce) inspire the eager young thespians to create and perform an original musical. Both mother and daughter want the show to champion the vital role they see the performing arts play in teaching children critical thinking, empathy, tolerance and communication skills. \u201cIt\u2019s the bridge across all countries,\u201d Ms. Andrews said, referring to drama, dance and music. \u201cThe hardest part for us with the show was not to get preachy but also to make it wildly entertaining. \u201d Ms. Andrews is keenly aware that her new show is entering a rapidly changing children\u2019s television world. The traditional major networks and even the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon are losing young viewers to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, which are plumping up their kids\u2019 programming with ever more offerings. Netflix currently streams more than 40 of its own children\u2019s shows, including \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events\u201d and \u201cTrollhunters,\u201d while Amazon offers 15 originals, such as \u201cAnnedroids\u201d and \u201cTumble Leaf. \u201d And HBO, which streams via HBO Go and HBO Now, cut a deal a year ago to air new episodes of \u201cSesame Street\u201d nine months before they appear on PBS. \u201cWhen I was growing up, I watched \u2018The Smurfs\u2019 on Saturday morning,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst specializing in technology and media at BTIG Research, referring to the NBC cartoon show from the 1980s. \u201cThat was the definition of kids\u2019 TV. Kids today don\u2019t even think about turning on the TV networks or cable on Saturday. They want it on demand, and that\u2019s how they\u2019re used to getting it. \u201d For the streaming services, in particular, their treasure trove of data clearly show what their viewers crave: According to Netflix, more than half of its 93 million members in nearly 200 countries, for example, regularly watch its children\u2019s shows. \u201cChildren\u2019s content is important, because it\u2019s our first opportunity to build brand love for Netflix that we hope will last a lifetime,\u201d said Andy Yeatman, director of global kids content at Netflix. The real targets, of course, are parents who pay the subscription fees. \u201cKids\u2019 content gives the household a reason to subscribe, because kids watch every single day,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said. Following their schmooze with the puppets, Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton discussed the birthing process for their show over scones and coffee in a conference room at the Creature Shop. The women have an easy rapport, built up not only as mother and daughter but also as the   of more than 30 popular children\u2019s books, including the \u201cDumpy the Dump Truck\u201d and \u201cThe Very Fairy Princess\u201d series. (Ms. Andrews has four other children, including two stepchildren, as well as 10 grandchildren and three  .) After the Henson Company approached Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton with the show\u2019s concept, the project was shopped to Netflix in late 2015 Mr. Yeatman and his team quickly said yes. \u201cOne of the things that attracted us was not so much that Julie was attached, but that this was a topic she cared a lot about: building a love for the performing arts in kids,\u201d Mr. Yeatman said. Then the real work started. Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton, together with Ms. Rof\u00e9, spent a week last winter mapping out the show\u2019s narrative arc and writing the pilot episode at the actress\u2019s home in Sag Harbor, N. Y. The peripatetic Ms. Andrews, a widow since the death in 2010 of the director Blake Edwards, now considers Sag Harbor, a former whaling village (where Ms. Hamilton also lives) her primary residence. Next came the creation and building of the show\u2019s seven puppet characters (which include a dog and Hugo the duck). Ms. Julie\u2019s five pupils are a true rainbow coalition, including one who is in a wheelchair and another who is seemingly gender neutral. \u201cThat\u2019s Riley she loves all the technical backstage stuff,\u201d Ms. Andrews said, pointing to an androgynous puppet sporting shortish red hair and round glasses. \u201cShe\u2019s a girl. \u201d Ms. Hamilton, 54, an actress turned writer and arts educator, chimed in. \u201cIf pressed, we\u2019d say that she\u2019s a girl, but maybe not forever,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be as diverse as possible. \u201d Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton weighed in extensively when the puppets were being designed and built at the Creature Shop. They helped choose hair color and texture, outfits, even nose shapes. \u201cMom, remember the 17 different fabric swatches we went through for Peri\u2019s skirt?\u201d Ms. Hamilton asked, referring to the    puppet. \u201cYes!\u201d Ms. Andrews replied. \u201cWe wanted it as icing pink as possible. \u201d The women also sat in on final casting sessions to pick an actor to play Gus, Ms. Julie\u2019s (human) assistant. Giullian Yao Gioiello (\u201cThe Carrie Diaries\u201d) won the role after strumming his guitar and demonstrating his    prowess. \u201cI was a bit in awe when I first walked in,\u201d he said of meeting Ms. Andrews. But after spending six weeks of nearly   days shooting the series at Grumman Studios in Bethpage, N. Y. he came to regard his energetic   as his honorary grandmother. \u201cShe\u2019d share stories and get me her favorite tea, a British brand called PG Tips. \u201d The biggest surprise? \u201cThat Julie Andrews at the end of the day wants a martini. \u201d Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton also lined up many of the show\u2019s celebrity guest stars. In the first episode, Ms. Menzel introduces the pupils to Broadway musicals. Ms. Julie informs them that Ms. Menzel was the voice of Elsa in Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen,\u201d a credit sure to impress young viewers more than her Broadway credits from \u201cWicked\u201d or \u201cRent. \u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t say no to Julie Andrews,\u201d Ms. Menzel said. After working with her on \u201cJulie\u2019s Greenroom,\u201d Ms. Menzel said, she\u2019s especially impressed by the veteran star\u2019s polite perfectionism. \u201cWe would rewrite things on the spot to make them better. She doesn\u2019t settle. She wanted to get things right, but she did it with grace. \u201d Several of the guest stars sing with Ms. Andrews, warbling original songs. Following a botched surgery on her vocal cords 20 years ago, her once   range is now reduced to one. These days, she  . \u201cI touch what notes I can and say the others,\u201d Ms. Andrews said. \u201cI have about three or four good bass notes left. I could sing you a terrific version of \u2018Old Man River. \u2019\u201d Ms. Andrews said she despaired,   because her whole identity \u201cwas being able to sing and the joy of it. \u201d She eventually realized  \u2014   \u201cIt was a great lifesaver\u201d  \u2014   that there were other ways to incorporate music into her life. Ms. Hamilton nodded. \u201cIn this show, Mom was very   with the songs and the underscoring,\u201d she said. Ms. Andrews added, \u201cThe arrangements, the scoring  \u2014   it\u2019s something I\u2019m so passionate about. \u201d It shows. In one of the most spirited scenes, cast members from the   Off Broadway show \u201cStomp\u201d visit to teach percussion. In an extended jam session, filmed in one long take, the \u201cStomp\u201d cast, Gus and the puppet pupils turn everyday objects in their classroom in an old theater into instruments. Ms. Julie joins in, picking up a china teacup and rhythmically whacking at it with a spoon. The action was unscripted. \u201cWho better than an English mum to pick up a teacup and start banging away?\u201d Ms. Andrews said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s serendipity. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628579.0177157}
