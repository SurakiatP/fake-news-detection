The most recent satellite photographs suggest a different plan. The photos, collected and scrutinized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a   research organization, show the construction of what appear to be reinforced aircraft hangars at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, all part of the disputed territories. There were no military aircraft seen at the time the photos were taken. But a summary of the center\u2019s analysis suggests that the hangars on all three islets have room for \u201cany   in the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force. \u201d A larger type of hangar on the islets can accommodate China\u2019s   bomber and   refueling tanker, a   transport aircraft and a KJ200 Airborne Warning and Control System plane, the center said in its analysis. While China may assert that the structures are for civilian aircraft or other nonmilitary functions, the center says its satellite photos strongly suggest otherwise. Besides their size  \u2014   the smallest hangars are 60 to 70 feet wide, more than enough to accommodate China\u2019s largest fighter jets  \u2014   all show signs of structural strengthening. \u201cThey are far thicker than you would build for any civilian purpose,\u201d Gregory B. Poling, director of the center\u2019s Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said on Monday in a telephone interview. \u201cThey\u2019re reinforced to take a strike. \u201d The largest hangars, 200 feet wide, are \u201cmore than enough for strategic bombers and refuelers,\u201d Mr. Poling said. If those planes were deployed, they would greatly complicate China\u2019s disputes with the Philippines and other nations, and add a level of military risk to the United States\u2019s \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d patrols through the area. Even before the hangars appeared, it was clear to independent military analysts that China\u2019s intention was to use the islands to flex military might in the area. \u201cWe knew from the day they started building those runways,\u201d Mr. Poling said. For China to assert a more benign purpose, he said, would be \u201clike saying you\u2019re building a mansion, but only living on the first floor. \u201d Evidence of the military hangars emerged a month after an international tribunal at The Hague sharply rebuked China over its behavior in the South China Sea, including its assertion of expansive sovereignty and construction of artificial islands. The tribunal\u2019s ruling was a response to a landmark case brought by the Philippines, which called it an \u201coverwhelming victory. \u201d Infuriated, China said it would ignore the ruling. Some analysts cautioned that the hangars were not a response to the ruling and had likely been under construction for some time. \u201cThe foundations may have been laid months ago,\u201d said M. Taylor Fravel, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of its Security Studies Program. Mr. Fravel said the hangars are not necessarily inconsistent with the Chinese president\u2019s assertions. \u201cChina has given itself the option to use these reefs as military facilities, but has not decided yet to what degree it is going to use them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates the option for a robust defense of those places or even a power projection. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561768.4090376}
