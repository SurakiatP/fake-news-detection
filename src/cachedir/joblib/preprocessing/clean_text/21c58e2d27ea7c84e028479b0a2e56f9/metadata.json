I mean, a dead man can\u2019t leak stuff. This guy\u2019s [Assange] a traitor, treasonous, and and he\u2019s broken every law of the United States. The guy ought to be \u2014 and I\u2019m not for the death penalty, so if I\u2019m not for the death penalty, the only way to do it is illegally shoot the son of a bitch .\u201d \\nBlog and news sites, including big names like ZeroHedge and Pamela Geller , are reporting Beckel\u2019s vile remarks as contemporaneous, in the context of WikiLeaks\u2019 current expos\u00e9s of Hillary and the DNC. \\nNot so. \\nBeckel actually made those remarks 5 years ago in December 2011. Here\u2019s a longer FoxNews video, wherein Beckel was part of a panel discussing how the U.S. should deal with Assange and WikiLeaks for their release of the State Department\u2019s diplomatic cables. Beckel\u2019s \u201cshoot the son of a bitch\u201d remarks begin at the 0:57 mark: \\nThat it was 5 years ago that Beckel had called for assassinating Julian Assange doesn\u2019t make it less reprehensible. It\u2019s also ridiculous for Beckel to call Assange \u201ca traitor\u201d and \u201ctreasonous,\u201d because Assange is Australian, not a U.S. citizen. \\nSo who is Bob Beckel? \\nAccording to Wikipedia , 67-year-old Bob Beckel is a political analyst-pundit who began his professional life as a Democratic administration official and Democratic Party operative. He was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State (1977) and Special Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs (1978) in the Carter administration; the campaign manager for Walter Mondale\u2019s 1984 presidential campaign; founder of the consulting & lobbying firm Bob Beckel & Associates (1984); campaign manager of a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in Idaho (2002); USA Today columnist (2005-2015); FoxNews \u201c token angry liberal \u201d co-host (2011-2015); and since October 2015, CNN commentator on the 2016 election. \\nWikipedia makes no mention of Beckel being a Hillary Clinton strategist, nor have I found confirmation that he is a Hillary strategist, other than what the WikiLeaks tweet claims. But all that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t a Hillary Clinton strategist, given Beckel\u2019s history as a Democratic Party operative. \\nThere must be a reason why WikiLeaks sent out its tweet of Beckel\u2019s 5-year-old call to assassinate Assange. Perhaps Assange has received death threats and does not want the same fate that befell DNC staffer and WikiLeaks informant Seth Rich.
