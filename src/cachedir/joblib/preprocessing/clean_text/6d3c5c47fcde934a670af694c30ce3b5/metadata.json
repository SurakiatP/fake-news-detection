Trump\u2019s America flowered through the old union strongholds of the Midwest, along rivers and rail lines that once moved coal from southern Ohio and the hollows of West Virginia to the smelters of Pennsylvania. It flowed south along the Mississippi River, through the rural Iowa counties that gave Barack Obama more votes than any Democrat in decades, and to the Northeast, through a corner of Connecticut and deep into Maine. And it extended through the suburbs of Cleveland and Minneapolis, of Manchester, N. H. and the sprawl north of Tampa, Fla. where   white voters chose Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton. One of the biggest upsets in American political history was built on a coalition of white voters unlike that of any other previous Republican candidate, according to election results and interviews with voters and demographic experts. Mr. Trump\u2019s coalition comprised not just staunchly conservative Republicans in the South and West. They were joined by millions of voters in the onetime heartlands of   liberal populism  \u2014   the Upper and Lower Midwest  \u2014   where white Americans without a college degree voted decisively to reject the more diverse, educated and cosmopolitan Democratic Party of the 21st century, making Republicans the country\u2019s dominant political party at every level of government. Mr. Trump spoke to their aspirations and fears more directly than any Republican candidate in decades, attacking illegal immigrants and Muslims and promising early Wednesday to return \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country\u201d to the symbolic and political forefront of American life. He electrified the country\u2019s white majority and mustered its full strength against   demographic decay. \u201cA lot of stuff he\u2019s talking about is just   common sense, which I think both parties have lost,\u201d said Tom Kirkpatrick, 51, a Trump supporter who used to work in an industrial laundry plant and is now on disability. He stood near the Florida State Capitol on Tuesday, holding an American flag. \u201cLet\u2019s put him in. And if he doesn\u2019t do what he says, I\u2019ll help you vote him out. \u201d But Mr. Trump also won over millions of voters who had once flocked to President Obama\u2019s promise of hope and change, and who on Tuesday saw in Mr. Trump their best chance to dampen the most painful blows of globalization and trade, to fight special interests, and to be heard and protected. Twelve percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters approved of Mr. Obama, according to the exit polls. Mrs. Clinton won by a greater margin than Mr. Obama among affluent whites, particularly those living in the Democratic Party\u2019s prosperous coastal strongholds: Washington and Boston, Seattle and New York. In Manhattan, where Mr. Trump lives and works  \u2014   and where his fellow citizens mocked and jeered him as he voted on Tuesday  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton won by a record margin, amassing 87 percent of the vote to Mr. Trump\u2019s 10 percent. Around the country, she won a majority of voters over all, harvesting the country\u2019s growing and densely packed big cities and a plurality of the suburbs. But Mr. Trump won   white voters to the Republican ticket, reversing a partisan divide along class lines that is as old as the Democratic and Republican Parties  \u2014   a replay of the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in June, when the old bastions of England\u2019s   voted decisively to leave the European Union. His breakthrough among white   voters in the North not only erased the Democratic advantage but reversed it, giving him a victory in the Electoral College while he lost the national popular vote. Most strikingly, Mr. Trump won his biggest margins among   white voters, according to exit polls, a revolt not only of the white working class but of the country\u2019s vast white middle class. He did better than past Republicans in the sprawling suburbs along Florida\u2019s central coasts, overwhelming Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gains among Hispanic voters. He held down Mrs. Clinton\u2019s margins in the Philadelphia suburbs, defying expectations that Mrs. Clinton would outperform Mr. Obama by a wide margin. Magnified by the constitutional design of the Electoral College, and aided by   efforts to dampen black and Latino voting in states like North Carolina, Mr. Trump\u2019s America proved the larger on Election Day. It smashed through the Democrats\u2019 supposed electoral \u201cblue wall\u201d  \u2014   the 18 states carried by Democrats in every election since 1992, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the diverse and   parts of the country that Mr. Obama attracted in his two races, like New Mexico, Nevada, Virginia and Colorado. Starting Wednesday, you could walk from the Vermont border through Appalachian coal country to the outskirts of St. Louis without crossing a county Mr. Trump did not win decisively. You could head south through rural and suburban Georgia all the way to South Florida, or northwest through the Upper Midwest, or make a beeline for the West Coast, skirting only the rising Democratic communities of Colorado and the booming multicultural sprawl of Las Vegas before finally reaching Mrs. Clinton\u2019s part of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he was the most polished of politicians,\u201d said Justin Channell, 36, of Brewer, Me. who works at a health insurance company. \u201cI liked the message of the   that corruption in D. C. is so prevalent. \u201d Mrs. Clinton won the America of big, racially diverse cities and centers of the new economy, from Silicon Valley to the Silicon Slopes of Utah, where many traditionally Republican voters rejected Mr. Trump. But lining up for Mr. Trump was a parallel urban America of smaller cities  \u2014   places like Scranton, Pa. Youngstown, Ohio and Dubuque, Iowa  \u2014   that boomed during the industrial era, and are still connected by the arteries of the old American economy. She had hoped for a surge of voting by Latinos, immigrants and   a manifestation of the rising American electorate long predicted by liberal strategists and feared by the Republican elite in Washington. But exit polls suggest that Mr. Trump  \u2014   despite his attacks on immigrants, Muslims and Mexicans, and his clumsy invocation of black neighborhoods mired in chaos and decay  \u2014   did not fare worse among the   and Latino voters who showed up to the polls than Mitt Romney did four years ago. In   County, where Mr. Trump had more room to lose ground among Hispanic voters than anywhere else in the country, Mrs. Clinton inched up to only 64 percent from Mr. Obama\u2019s 62 percent of the Hispanic vote. Turnout dropped considerably in black communities across the country, from the rural South to Cleveland, Milwaukee and Detroit. By Wednesday, the notion of a Democratic electoral map advantage bolstered by rising Hispanic power seemed distant. Even if Mrs. Clinton had won Florida, Mr. Trump would have powered to victory through the new Republican heartland, in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where Hispanic voters represent just a fraction of the electorate. Nor was the growing Hispanic vote  \u2014   and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strength among   voters  \u2014   enough to pull her especially close in either Arizona or Texas, the only two heavily Hispanic states that could have plausibly joined Florida to put her over the top. Even where   Hispanics are growing as a force, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters were waiting on Tuesday. Anthony Brdar, 42, stood in front of his West Miami polling station, holding a handmade \u201cVote Trump\u201d sign, and waved a   of Mr. Obama\u2019s face made to look like the Joker. It called him a tyrant. An    lawyer who lives in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood in Miami, Mr. Brdar said he had never felt so compelled to vote. \u201cI feel our country is on the verge of becoming a third world country,\u201d he said. \u201cOur children are not going to have a future. We are not going to have a future. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563203.441617}
