[\u201cI think it\u2019s an issue which deeply concerns people like myself and other people,   officers in the intel community,\u201d Uehlinger said. \u201cEven though at this point, there seems to be no evidence of breaking the law, this \u2018unmasking\u2019 of people was   at best. I think it really shows that abuse of power and the fact that many people in the Obama administration were willing to violate the spirit of the laws designed to protect Americans, perhaps rather than the law itself. \u201d  LISTEN: \u201cAs a   CIA officer, we were always told by upper authority, you\u2019re always told to  \u2014   and the quote is  \u2014   \u2018avoid the appearance of impropriety,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWell, this does not pass that smell test, definitely. \u201d Uehlinger said another thing that concerns   officers in the intelligence and military communities is \u201cthe American people, average Americans like myself, are tired of seeing two sets of rules followed by the   and then the   people. \u201d \u201cThis is just part of that again. A   officer would have gotten into big trouble doing anything remotely like this,\u201d he observed. \u201cBut now, we have a lot of people saying that she should just be given a pass. \u201d \u201cWhile I understand, you know, it\u2019s important that the Trump administration has to move forward with its domestic agenda, but these allegations demand to be further investigated,\u201d he urged. Kassam proposed that Democrats and their media would not allow the Trump administration to move forward with any part of its agenda until this \u201cRussia hysteria\u201d is cleaned up. That will be a difficult task since, as Kassam noted, the hysteria has been burning at fever pitch for months without a shred of evidence to back up the wildest allegations. Uehlinger agreed and addressed Kassam\u2019s point that media coverage alternates between \u201cno surveillance was conducted\u201d and \u201cwe know everything about Trump\u2019s Russia connections. \u201d \u201cThe Obama administration relaxed the rule that allowed raw intelligence that was gathered by the NSA to be shared throughout the government,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cFirst of all, to relax that, there is absolutely no operational justification for doing that. With all of the   problems, with espionage, with Snowden, all these things we\u2019ve had, to raise by an order of magnitude the access to this very sensitive information makes no operational sense at all. \u201d  \u201cSo for someone to approve that, it\u2019s clear they had another intent, and I believe the intent was to allow for further leakage,\u201d he charged. \u201cTo give more people access, thus more leaks, which, in fact, would hurt the Trump administration. It seems very obvious when you put that together and combine it with the actions of Susan Rice and other people in unmasking people. That is the true purpose behind this. \u201d  \u201cI say this as somebody who  \u2014   you have to remember, when I was a station chief overseas, this is what I was reporting on. I was in countries like Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kosovo  \u2014   countries which constantly had the offices of the prime minister or president using the intelligence services to suppress the domestic opposition. So I\u2019ve been to this rodeo before, many a time. I saw the storm clouds gathering several weeks ago, and everything I\u2019ve suspected has so far come to fruition,\u201d Uehlinger said. He pronounced it \u201cvery disappointing\u201d that such transparent abuse of government power for partisan politics would occur in the United States. \u201cAn intelligence service has to have the trust of the people and the government in order to function effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all of these scandals happening, and with the name of perhaps the CIA and other intelligence community elements in the mud, this makes the object of protecting our national security more problematic. The agencies have to have the trust of the American people, and they\u2019re losing it, because it seems as though they\u2019ve been weaponized  \u2014    perhaps, like I said, not breaking the law but playing very close to the line. \u201d Kassam suggested that leaking the information might have been illegal, even if Rice was legally entitled to request information on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and unmask the U. S. persons monitored during surveillance of foreign intelligence targets. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely the case,\u201d Uehlinger agreed. He went on to argue that the absence of hard evidence for any wrongdoing by the Trump campaign in all of these leaks was highly significant. \u201cSince basically the Obama administration has sort of loaded this with these rule changes and all to allow for leaks the fact that there is no \u2018smoking gun\u2019 of Trump administration collusion with Russia indicates that there isn\u2019t any. There is nothing substantial here because a juicy morsel like that would certainly have been leaked by the same people that have been leaking everything else. The fact it hasn\u2019t been leaked out means it does not exist,\u201d he reasoned. Kassam said some of the Russia hysteria came from imputing sinister motives to conventional business dealings, arguing that Trump\u2019s organization made deals around the world, and it is exceedingly difficult to do business with any Russian entity that is not somehow connected to the Russian government. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent point. You\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d Uehlinger responded. \u201cIt shows these people who are doing these gambits are relying on the relative ignorance of the American public of the actual nuts and bolts of intelligence to make their point. Anyone with any background in this stuff can see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to discredit an administration because they were crushed in the past elections. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
