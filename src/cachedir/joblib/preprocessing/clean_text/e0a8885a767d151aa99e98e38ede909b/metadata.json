Bernie Sanders.[  During a hearing of the Senate Committee on the budget this week, Sanders essentially told nominee Russell Vought that Christians are bigoted and, therefore, should not serve in public office. Sanders pointed to an article Vought wrote in January 2016 about Dr. Larycia Hawkins, a political science professor at Wheaton College, Vought\u2019s alma mater, who was placed on administrative leave after wearing a hijab to support Muslims. Hawkins had consulted with the Council on   Relations (CAIR) prior to donning the hijab. In a Facebook post, she had also suggested that Christians and Muslims worship the same God. Vought took issue with Hawkins\u2019 post in a piece at the Resurgent, from which Sanders quoted. Excerpts from the exchange are as follows: Sanders: \u201cMuslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned. \u201d Do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic? Vought: Absolutely not, Senator. I\u2019m a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith. Sanders: Forgive me, we just don\u2019t have a lot of time. Do you believe people in the Muslim religion stand condemned? Is that your view? Vought: Again, Senator, I\u2019m a Christian, and I wrote that piece in accordance with the statement of faith at Wheaton College. Sanders: I understand that. I don\u2019t know how many Muslims there are in America. Maybe a couple million. Are you suggesting that these people stand condemned? What about Jews? Do they stand condemned too? Vought: Senator, I\u2019m a Christian. Sanders: I understand you are a Christian, but this country [is] made of people who are not just \u2014  I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned? Vought: Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that as a Christian that\u2019s how I should treat all individuals. Sanders: Do you think that\u2019s respectful of other religions?   \u2026     I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about. I will vote \u201cno. \u201d \u201cIn my view, the statement made by Mr. Vought is indefensible, it is hateful, it is Islamophobic, and it is an insult to over a billion Muslims throughout the world,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThis country, since its inception, has struggled, sometimes with great pain, to overcome discrimination of all forms.   \u2026     We must not go backwards. \u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen ( ) decided Sanders\u2019 line of questioning was worthy of pursuing further at the same time he denied they were attacking Vought\u2019s Christian faith. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, but part of being a Christian, in my view, is recognizing that there are lots of ways that people can pursue their God,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cNo one is questioning your faith.   \u2026     It\u2019s your comments that suggest a violation of the public trust in what will be a very important position. \u201d Writing at the Atlantic, Emma Green asserts, \u201cIt was a remarkable moment: a Democratic senator lecturing a nominee for public office on the correct interpretation of Christianity in a confirmation hearing putatively about the Office of Management and Budget. \u201d She continues: Article VI of the U. S. Constitution states that \u201cno religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. \u201d On Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders flirted with the boundaries of this rule during a confirmation hearing for Russell Vought, President Trump\u2019s nominee for deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. David French writes at National Review: This is a disgraceful and unconstitutional line of questioning from the man who came close to being the Democratic nominee for president. He\u2019s not only imposing a religious test for public office in direct violation of Article VI of the United States Constitution, he\u2019s gone so far as to label this decent man  \u2014   who\u2019s seeking to serve his country in a vital role  \u2014   as \u201cnot someone who this country is supposed to be about. \u201d Vought expressed entirely orthodox Christian beliefs. There is nothing \u201cextreme\u201d about his statements, and they mirror the statements of faith of countless Christian churches and schools across the land. Are these believers also not fit for public office? I\u2019ve written that Christians and Muslims don\u2019t worship the same God. I suppose that means America\u2019s not \u201cabout\u201d me, either. Family Research Council (FRC) which has launched a petition calling on Sanders to \u201capologize for his religious bigotry,\u201d states, \u201cOur Constitution guarantees there will be no religious litmus test. Americans should never be forced to choose between their faith and public service. \u201d \u201cActually, Russell Vought is exactly what this country is about,\u201d FRC states. \u201cHe\u2019s exercising the belief that America was founded upon: that we are one nation, under God. The ability to voice that belief \u2014  even in the public square \u2014  is the same vision that brought the Pilgrims to America. \u201d \u201cBut after two terms of trying to drive Christianity underground, the Left isn\u2019t about to declare a cease fire,\u201d it continues. \u201cIf Bernie Sanders\u2019s comments are any indication, they\u2019re more determined than ever to wipe men and women of faith off the public service map. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628545.309992}
