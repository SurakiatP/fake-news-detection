With that pressure comes constant criticism,\u201d Weld said in a statement issued Wednesday in Boston. \\n\u201cAfter careful observation and reflection, I have come to believe that Donald Trump, if elected President of the United States, would not be able to stand up to this pressure and this criticism without becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently the duties of his office.\u201d Libertarian VP nominee Bill Weld on MSNBC wishes Clinton a happy birthday, as he discusses issuing his statement against Trump pic.twitter.com/uOrqCpwDyy \u2014 Eli Watkins (@EliBWatkins) October 26, 2016 \\nWeld said the Libertarian Party had made strides \u201ct oward breaking the two party monopoly,\u201d and that America would be stronger when it did, but \u201cgiven the Commission on Presidential Debates, the deck is stacked against a credible third party ticket.\u201d \\nThe Libertarian Party, led by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson, was polling under 10 percent nationally, not enough for the party to be included in the presidential debates. 2+2= #ImWithHer .

He stopped short of endorsing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by name. \\n\u201cMr. Trump has some charisma and panache, and intellectual quickness. These qualities can be entertaining. Yet more than charisma, more even than intellectual ability, is required of a serious candidate for this country\u2019s highest office. A serious candidate for the Presidency of the United States must be stable, and Donald Trump is not stable.\u201d \u2014 RT America (@RT_America) September 27, 2016 \\nWeld said Trump had demonstrated his inability to handle criticism or blame and that his first instinct was to lash out and when challenged \u201che often responds as a child might.\u201d \\n\u201cHe makes a sour face, he calls people by insulting names, he waves his arms, he impatiently interrupts. Most families would not allow their children to remain at the dinner table if they behaved as Mr. Trump does. He has not exhibited self-control, the discipline, or the emotional depth necessary to function credibly as a President of the United States,\u201d Weld said.

Donald Trump should not, cannot, and must not be elected President of the United States,\u201d the Libertarian VP candidate concluded.'"}, "time": 1742563574.3894186}
