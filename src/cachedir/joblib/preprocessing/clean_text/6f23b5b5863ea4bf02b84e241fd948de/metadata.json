The person responsible for many of the threats, law enforcement officials said, was half a world away, in Israel, a Jewish teenager. An intensive investigation spanning multiple countries culminated on Thursday in the arrest of the    suspect, who holds dual Israeli and American citizenship, and his father. The teenager\u2019s lawyer said he had a brain tumor that could affect his behavior. The surge in threats over the past few months  \u2014   well over 100 sent to Jewish community centers, schools and museums since the start of the year  \u2014   coincided with an increase in hate crimes against a number of groups, from scrawled swastikas to homicides, feeding worries about a new era of bigotry. American and Israeli officials refused to say how many of those threats the suspect was accused of making. And some recent   acts were apparently committed by others, like threats against Jewish centers for which a Missouri man was charged, and the vandalizing of Jewish cemeteries. But officials made it clear that they considered the teenager, who lived in the Ashkelon area of southern Israel, to be the primary source of the threats, though they did not offer a motive. \u201cThis is the guy we are talking about,\u201d an Israeli police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said. The suspect made threats to sites in Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States, and to at least one commercial airline flight, prompting an emergency landing, Mr. Rosenfeld said. A judge ordered the suspect, who has not been charged, held until at least March 30 and ordered a medical examination. His father was ordered held for eight days, on suspicion that he might have been aware of the threats, or even been involved. The father denies any knowledge of the threats, his lawyer said. The judge imposed an order of silence forbidding the Israeli authorities to release either man\u2019s name. The teenager, who was born in Israel, has a brain tumor that can affect his cognitive abilities and lead to \u201cirrational\u201d behavior, his lawyer, Galit Bash, said. She would not say whether her client, who she said did not have a criminal record, had admitted or denied involvement. Ms. Bash and the father\u2019s lawyer, Eran Rau, who are both from the Office of the Israeli Public Defender, said the young man was an only child who lived with his parents and had been   which is unusual in Israel. While most Israelis are drafted into military service, the teenager was rejected, which Ms. Bash said was because of his medical condition. Israeli news media reported that she had said in court that he had the tumor since he was 14. The father, an engineer in his early 50s, was cooperating with investigators, Mr. Rau said. He said his client, who also has no criminal record, was concerned primarily with his son\u2019s welfare, given his medical condition. \u201cThis all seems very strange and preliminary to me,\u201d Mr. Rau said. Israeli news outlets reported that when the teenager was arrested, he tried to grab an officer\u2019s gun. In his brief court appearance, the suspect, wearing khaki cargo pants, bowed his head and pulled up his shirt to conceal his face. On Thursday morning, after months of investigation and waves of turmoil and panic, the Federal Bureau of Investigation held a conference call with leaders of Jewish organizations to discuss the surprising denouement to the investigation. As the news spread, it drew mixed reactions from Jewish leaders and   groups who tried to make sense of it. Joel Dinkin, the executive vice president of the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center of Houston, said that it was \u201ca little bit perplexing from the standpoint of the fact that it\u2019s somebody Jewish. \u201d Jonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the   League, cautioned that many of the people responsible for   threats, vandalism and \u201ca torrent of abuse online\u201d remained at large. And even the threats attributed to the Israeli teenager, he said, should still be considered acts of  . \u201cThe motive may have been unclear, but the impact was crystal clear,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. \u201cThese were acts that terrorized a community just because of their faith. \u201d Critics of President Trump have accused him of playing down hatred and violence against minority groups and charged that his   remarks are fueling conflict. He did not publicly condemn the   threats and vandalism until Feb. 21, weeks after Jewish groups began calling on him to speak out. On Feb. 28, in a meeting with state attorneys general, Mr. Trump suggested that some of the threats and vandalism could be a politically motivated effort to \u201cmake people look bad,\u201d rather than actual expressions of bias, according to people who took part in the meeting. Despite the arrest, \u201cwe hope our elected officials will directly confront the wave of hate violence that we\u2019ve seen since the election,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Project. The authorities said the person who made the calls had sent them through the internet and used sophisticated software to disguise his location and camouflage his voice, which slowed the investigation. When the Israeli police searched the suspect\u2019s house, investigators confiscated computers, an antenna and other equipment. An American official said it appeared that the man had used Tor, widely available anonymity software that masks a computer\u2019s true whereabouts by routing its internet traffic through various points around the globe. Many people use Tor, which is managed by a nonprofit digital privacy group, including those conducting illicit business and activists trying to avoid government censorship or surveillance. \u201cThe investigation began in several countries at the same time, in which dozens of threatening calls were received at public places, events, synagogues and community buildings that caused panic and disrupted events and activities in various organizations,\u201d the Israeli police said in a statement. The F. B. I. worked closely with the Israeli authorities on the investigation, starting in September  \u2014   months before American organizations began to note a surge in threats to American targets, according to Cary Gleicher, the bureau\u2019s top agent in Israel. Some of the earliest American targets of bomb threats were schools, centers and museums in Alaska, Florida and New York that were affiliated with   an Orthodox Jewish movement, according to a Chabad official. The movement did not publicize the threats, which received little or no news coverage. Mr. Gleicher said he had met in early March in Washington with James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, who asked about efforts to find the person making the threatening calls, and made it clear that he had \u201cgreat interest in getting this thing done. \u201d In   Mr. Comey met with Jewish leaders at bureau headquarters to brief them on the investigation. \u201cI left with a level of confidence that they were definitively making strides,\u201d said Jerry B. Silverman, the chief executive of the Jewish Federations of North America. \u201cIt was clear that they were moving at a very rapid pace. \u201d The   cooperation intensified last week, when the F. B. I. sent 14 people  \u2014   both agents and technical experts  \u2014   to Israel to assist in the investigation, Mr. Gleicher said in an interview from Israel. \u201cThis was a big deal,\u201d he said, adding that it had taken the resources of both countries to get \u201cacross the finish line. \u201d \u201cMonday was the eureka moment,\u201d he said, when investigators figured out who was making the calls. In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who described the threats as \u201chate crimes,\u201d said, \u201cThe Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562998.663363}
