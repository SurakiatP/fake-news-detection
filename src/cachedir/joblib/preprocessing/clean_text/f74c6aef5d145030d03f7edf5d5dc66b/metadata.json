The model Naomi Campbell was apparently one who did. \u201cI was 17 years old when I met him,\u201d Ms. Campbell said on Thursday, the day of Prince\u2019s death. \u201cI was with Azzedine Ala\u00efa and   Mondino in Paris, and I remember Prince said to me not to wear high heels, and I wore the highest heels I could find. Because it went with Azzedine\u2019s outfit. \u201d But the two soon became fast friends, and she was often a fixture at his concerts no matter where (or, more notably, when) Prince decided to play. \u201cHe used to call me every time he came to London or Paris,\u201d Ms. Campbell said. \u201cIt would be 2 o\u2019clock in the morning and he\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m going to play\u2019 and I would go out in my pajamas. That was it. He was impromptu. The last time I saw Amy Winehouse was when she performed with Prince. They sang one of her songs and one of his. They were a powerhouse, the two of them. He loved talent. \u201d For many in the fashion world, the film and album \u201cPurple Rain\u201d became their gateway to a lifelong connection to Prince, as both a performer and role model. \u201cI saw it three times in three days,\u201d said the photographer Bruce Weber. \u201cIt was just like \u2018wow.\u2019 Only he could make this wonderful movie that was kind of about nothing and yet was about everything. Part of what I also loved was that not only did he do great music but he was smaller than the other musicians and he always got the girl. You felt like the biggest, tallest guy even though he wore high heels because he was so short. \u201d George Cortina, one of the industry\u2019s   stylists, said: \u201cI\u2019d just gotten out of rehab when I first heard \u2018Purple Rain.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe that album. It was the most brilliant thing I ever heard. \u201d Edward Enninful, the creative and fashion director of W, can still remember what it was like when he found out about Prince. He was a gay kid in London when his older brother came home to their mother\u2019s flat and pulled out a copy of \u201cDirty Mind,\u201d the singer\u2019s 1980 album that featured a black and white image of the Minneapolis singer wearing an open studded trench coat that amply displayed his   androgynous glory. \u201cI\u2019d never seen anything like it in my life,\u201d Mr. Enninful said. \u201cSomeone so blatantly challenging the ideas of race and gender and sexuality. In a way, it was comparable to David Bowie, except that Prince brought that to the black community. \u201d There\u2019d been hints of that before with Teddy Pendergrass and Rick James, as well as Sylvester and Little Richard. But the remix seemed entirely new with Prince, and Mr. Enninful worshiped at his altar, loving his ruffled shirts with the Edwardian collars and black matador outfits with the crazy crop tops. In time there were comparisons to another great superstar of his time: Michael Jackson. But Prince was different. Adept not just as a singer, guitarist, keyboard player and dancer, he was also virtually unmatched in his ability to destabilize people both privately and publicly. Where Mr. Jackson used songs like \u201cBad\u201d and \u201cBillie Jean\u201d to shed his androgyny and sexual ambiguity, Prince reveled in them, singing, \u201cAm I black or   I straight or gay. \u201d \u201cI always saw it like Prince was the bad brother and Michael was the good brother,\u201d Mr. Enninful said. \u201cHe was pop, with clean lyrics. Prince was not scared. The first time I heard someone sing about AIDS it was Prince: \u2018In France, a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name.\u2019 He was not afraid of taboos. \u201d That fearlessness extended to his costumes, which were further exercises in contradiction and gender ambiguity. He rocked heavily embellished   heels but his shirts were open to the navel, showing off his chest hair. \u201cHe wore the most incredible opulent fabrics and the boots were always made to match,\u201d said Mary Kay Stolz, who worked on the singer\u2019s costumes for the tour of \u201cPurple Rain. \u201d \u201cInternational Silks and Woolens, the best fabric store in L. A. would stay open late for me because I would fly in late from Minneapolis just to get fabric and turn around. \u201d Mystery was an essential component of his persona. There was an aura of secrecy about him even among the people who wound up in close proximity to him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make a lot of eye contact and I did sign a   nondisclosure before I left,\u201d Ms. Stolz said. \u201cWhen I was there, the bodyguards said to people, \u2018Don\u2019t talk to Prince unless he talks to you.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t like, \u2018Hey Prince.\u2019 It\u2019s not like anything was really conveyed, although he liked what he liked. I would leave the clothes at night and he would try them and if he liked them they wouldn\u2019t be there anymore. He was in his musical world and that was it. \u201d Invariably, the fashion world claimed him as one of their own. Designers like Donatella Versace hired him to play at their shows, including in 2011, when Prince performed along with Nicki Minaj at an opening night party in New York for a collaboration between Versace and H  M. By this point Prince was not so much the sartorial maverick he\u2019d once been as the Las Vegas version of himself, playing guitar in a pair of black ovular shades and decked out in a tight red suit. Among those in attendance was the designer Joseph Altuzarra. \u201cI remember how epic the performance was,\u201d he said. \u201cI think more than anyone, really, Prince felt like he was above it all  \u2014   just such a legend, a living legend. \u201d Mr. Altuzarra recently channeled Prince\u2019s style for his fall 2015 collection of ruffled lace blouses, one he said had been inspired in part by what he called the singer\u2019s   period in the 1980s. \u201cThere\u2019s always something that he wore that I think is really fascinating, and I tend to really love looking at musicians\u2019 wardrobes for inspiration. I\u2019ve definitely looked at his style pictures. \u201d Ms. Versace, who did get to know Prince over the years, found a lack of pretension beneath the surface. \u201cOne of the last conversations I had with Prince was about coming to my show,\u201d she said in statement. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018Let\u2019s have no celebrities in the first row, no V. I. P. s. Let\u2019s have the smart and real people who do what they think is right and put all their energy to make our world better and don\u2019t get the attention they deserve. \u2019\u201d \u201cI am crying,\u201d she added. \u201cAll my memories are coming back to me. He was one of my closest friends. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628507.684026}
