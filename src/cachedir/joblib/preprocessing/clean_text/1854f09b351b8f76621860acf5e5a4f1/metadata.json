Mike Edmonson, he told reporters in November, \u201cIt is the most disturbing thing I\u2019ve seen, and I will leave it at that.\u201d \\nAccording to the lawsuit, referenced by KLFY , defendants include \u201cNorris Greenhouse Jr. and Derrick Stafford, the two former Marksville Ward 2 deputy marshals facing second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder in the case. Both pleaded not guilty and are facing separate trials. \\n\u201cBut the lawsuit also names as defendants Marksville City Marshal Floyd Voinche, the Marksville City Court, the town of Marksville, Avoyelles Parish, Progressive Paloverde Insurance Company and the other two officers involved in the chase of Few that night \u2014 Jason Brouillette and Kenneth Parnell III.\u201d \\nOn November 3, 2015, according to the original police account, the four officers were attempting to serve a warrant for Few \u2014 who then fled in his sister\u2019s Kia Sport, with Jeremy buckled in the passenger seat. \\nPolice had claimed Few was armed and posed an imminent deadly threat \u2014 so Officers Greenhouse and Stafford opened fire \u2014 emptying 18 rounds at the vehicle, critically injuring Few and killing the 6-year-old, who had autism. \\nIn actuality, no warrant had been issued for Few, and both father and son were unarmed \u2014 indeed, as video evidence shows, Few had his hands in the air when he received \u201ctwo or three\u201d bullets to the head and chest, while Jeremy suffered \u201cfour or five\u201d shots to the head and neck. \\nAppallingly, Jeremy languished in agony, still holding onto life for over five minutes after being shot multiple times \u2014 but officers failed to even check for a pulse or render assistance. \\n\u201cDuring this time, Jeremy was bleeding profusely and suffered immensely due to the gunshot wounds,\u201d the lawsuit states, according to KFLY . \\n\u201cIt was not until approximately some seven and one-half to eight minutes or so after the hail of gunfire, that an officer at the scene, believed to be Parnell, finally checked Jeremy for a pulse and discovered that he was still alive, despite having been shot multiple times including in the head and neck,\u201d it reads. \\n\u201cHowever, none of the officers at the scene, including Stafford, Greenhouse, Brouillette and Parnell initiated or rendered any form of first aid, nor did they undertake any other measures in an attempt to stop Jeremy\u2019s bleeding or otherwise alleviate or mitigate Jeremy\u2019s suffering, or made any attempts to save his life. \\n\u201cSadly, Jeremy was left to suffer \u2014 and die \u2014 while the officers casually searched for \u2018gloves.\u2019\u201d \\nAn exact motive for the original traffic stop \u2014 given the fictitious claim of a warrant and that Few did not have a weapon \u2014 has yet to be publicly released by officials. Attorneys for Greenhouse and Stafford stated during court proceedings Few had been standing in the road, blocking traffic, ignored officers\u2019 commands, and then fled the scene. \\nBut the lawsuit contends there had been no clear reason for police to pursue the vehicle Few was driving, and when he ultimately did pull over, the vehicle, \u201ceven if it were moving forward or backwards \u2014 did not and could not have presented an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to any of the officers at the scene or innocent bystanders.\u201d \\nAs video clearly shows, Few pulled to the side of the road, raised his arms above his head and made no threatening gestures \u2014 in other words, he posed not even the slightest legitimate threat to their safety. The lawsuit continues : \\n\u201cMoreover, at the time the pursuit of Christopher was initiated, and thereafter during the pursuit, none of the officers had reasonable or probable cause to believe that Christopher had committed some crime, was committing a crime or was about to commit a crime. The pursuit was unlawful, as was the subsequent use of deadly force.\u201d \\nFatally shooting a 6-year-old child wasn\u2019t the first brutal act by either Stafford or Greenhouse. As The Free Thought Project reported, the pair of rageful cops have a history of brutalizing their town with impunity \u2014 and as the lawsuit notes, it seems no vetting procedure was in place when Greenhouse and Stafford were hired. \\nAdditionally, when attorneys made a public records request with Marksville City Marshal Floyd Voinche for hiring, training, and disciplinary guidelines concerning deputy marshals, they received a telling one-sentence reply: \u201cNo such records exist.\u201d \\n\u201cThe need for such policies is so obvious,\u201d KFLY quotes the lawsuit, \u201cfor the safety of the public and the protection of constitutional rights that the lack of such policies constitutes deliberate indifference and a reckless disregard for the public and plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d \\nBut the fact it took an innocent 6-year-old\u2019s death to force the city to examine such policies is endemic of brutal policing in the United States \u2014 and one means officers can employ to work around appropriate discipline is to resign and simply move on to the next department. \\nIn late September, in a stunning act of hubris, Stafford again requested charges be dropped since he acted in self defense \u2014 despite damning evidence to the contrary. \\nThe family of Jeremy Mardis is requesting a jury trial in this lawsuit.
