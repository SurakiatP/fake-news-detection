Ayelet Waldman: intemperate tweeter, guerrilla oversharer, provocateur, literary exhibitionist, cyclone of sass. When The New York Times Book Review didn\u2019t select her novel \u201cLove and Treasure\u201d as one of its 100 Notable Books of 2014, she unleashed a  tweetstorm of hurt. (  excerpt: \u201cthere are MANY books on that notable list with reviews that were NOWHERE near as good as mine. \u201d) When she announced in a 2005 essay that she loved her husband, the novelist Michael Chabon, more than she loved her children, outraged mothers everywhere clucked and   and when she expressed surprise, the chorus came back  \u2014   Well, what on earth did you expect? But here\u2019s my question for those who sneer at or   her new memoir about the possible therapeutic value of LSD, \u201cA Really Good Day: How Microdosing Made a Mega Difference in My Mood, My Marriage, and My Life\u201d: What on earth did you expect? Here is the truth about Ms. Waldman, which complicates matters for those who don\u2019t like her: She has spent many years struggling with punishing, ungovernable moods. Originally, doctors told her she had bipolar II disorder years later, a psychiatrist decided premenstrual dysphoric disorder more closely corresponded with her symptoms, and Ms. Waldman agreed. But whatever it\u2019s called, hers is not a mood disorder of the quiet, novelistic variety. It\u2019s big and operatic, often driving her to do the very things for which she\u2019s been publicly shamed: acting out, picking fights, trawling for affirmation. Just because she doesn\u2019t have a picturesque version of melancholy doesn\u2019t make it any less real or any less deserving of compassion. And after reading \u201cA Really Good Day,\u201d you understand just why Ms. Waldman might have been willing to experiment to find relief. She\u2019d exhausted her family. She\u2019d exhausted all manner of therapies. And she\u2019d exhausted just about every drug in the pharmacopoeia  \u2014   including the ones that sound like Spanish dances (Cymbalta, Strattera, Concerta) the ones that look like typing tests (Zoloft, Effexor, Seroquel) and the ones that could well be craters on the moon (Valium, Ambien, Lunesta). Her Ambien dependence proved particularly problematic. When she took too much, she\u2019d have text exchanges with Mr. Chabon that looked like this: Hence Ms. Waldman\u2019s   trial with LSD  \u2014   10 micrograms every three days. A microdose, as she explains, is anywhere from   to   of what one would find on a   tab of acid. It doesn\u2019t turn the world into a bubbling lava lamp. This dosage, taken at this rate, is \u201c\u201d according to the psychologist and former psychedelic researcher James Fadiman. Mr. Fadiman\u2019s (admittedly informal, nonrandomized) research suggests that people who follow this protocol simply feel   \u2026     better. Ms. Waldman wanted to know what something as luxuriously pedestrian as \u201cbetter\u201d was like. \u201cA Really Good Day\u201d is a captain\u2019s log of her    trip. It combines daily reports of her moods with the research she\u2019s done about the history of psychedelics and her extended meditations on drugs and the law. (Before becoming a writer, Ms. Waldman was a federal public defender.) And what does she find? That the experience really is transformative. \u201cYou\u2019ve been much happier,\u201d her younger daughter tells her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been controlling your emotions. Like, when you\u2019re angry, you\u2019re  . \u201d The reader doesn\u2019t have quite as uniformly positive an experience. Part of the problem is aesthetic: Ms. Waldman has a tendency to slide into the prefab language of psychotherapy or  . (\u201cIt is suddenly so obvious that what I need to do is just get out of my own way. \u201d) Her sense of humor can be unsubtle. (On the weak magic mushrooms she once tried in college: \u201cIt\u2019s possible that all I ate was a handful of dried shiitakes dipped in cow manure. \u201d) She\u2019s a fan of extended metaphors, and almost no one should be a fan of extended metaphors. They involve beating a dead horse, converting it to glue, and then discovering the glue doesn\u2019t work. If you see what I mean. And her observations can be trite. Her anxious   while meditating  \u2014   \u201cNow you\u2019re thinking about thinking! Stop berating yourself for thinking!\u201d  \u2014   will surprise exactly no one. But then Ms. Waldman will capture you with genuinely brave and human moments, like when she confesses that she yells at people because she enjoys it. Or when she says her talents aren\u2019t considerable enough to earn her a great artist\u2019s tempestuous mood swings. Or expresses guilt that her oldest child has had to bear the brunt of her anger and depression. Her reminiscences about her time defending poor, defenseless clients in Los Angeles are riveting. I am not sure they belong in this book  \u2014   especially when she talks about the unfairness of our sentencing guidelines (I mean, agreed, but this is neither the time nor the place for  )  \u2014   but I\u2019d love to see an independent memoir about her legal work one day. Ms. Waldman\u2019s survey of the history and literature of psychotropic drugs is informative, though it can also, on occasion, be too sloppy and loose. She casually drops the phrase \u201cAlzheimer\u2019  benzos\u201d (short for benzodiazepines, that class of   drugs including Valium and Xanax) without so much as a footnote, and this claim is hardly settled science. She writes that Francis Crick \u201creportedly\u201d experimented with LSD when he envisioned the double helix, and then takes it back in a footnote. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we just pretend it\u2019s true?\u201d she asks. No, we can\u2019t. There are other uncareful moments of this kind, and other undocumented declarations. I mention them not to be picayune, but because writing about drug research is a delicate business, requiring a certain amount of control in one\u2019s voice. You really don\u2019t want readers doubting your authority when you\u2019re making an argument in favor of a maligned and illegal substance. But it\u2019s an argument that needs to be made. As she did with her 2009 essay collection, \u201cBad Mother,\u201d which decriminalized ordinary mommy infractions and helped bring a sense of proportion to the messy enterprise of parenting, Ms. Waldman brings a huge dose of compassion and, yes, good sense to \u201cA Really Good Day. \u201d Whatever her foibles or stylistic lapses, she makes a persuasive case for the therapeutic use of psychedelics. (Want to be inspired? Read the research on the effects of hallucinogens on dying cancer patients.) As ever, Ms. Waldman is wielding her powers of provocation to goad us into an uncomfortable but necessary conversation. Quibble with her style, her methods, her desire to attract attention. In normalizing the conversation about LSD, she may one day help others feel normal.'"}, "time": 1742562148.7919354}
