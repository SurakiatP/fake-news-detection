Chinese State media noted that \u201cXi\u2019s   trip at    was marked by cordiality, with both presidents seen smile [sic] to each other. \u201d Some issues discussed during the visit are important to the United States: Trade and Currency, Trump told the Chinese that they needed to \u201clevel the playing field for American workers,\u201d according to a statement from the White House. He expressed concerns about the Chinese government\u2019s intervention in U. S. economy was hurting jobs for the American worker. Both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross spoke positively of a \u201c  plan\u201d that they discussed with their Chinese counterparts to make important changes immediately. \u201cThe most interesting thing to me was they expressed an interest in reducing their net trade balance because of the impact it\u2019s having on money supply and inflation,\u201d Ross said about the Chinese. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard them say that in a bilateral context. \u201d According to Xinhua, the Chinese state media, President Xi urged both countries to \u201cgrasp the opportunity\u201d of economic development between the two countries and signaled interest in future investments. \u201cChina welcomes the U.

South China Sea, Officials from the United States discussed the ongoing military buildup in the East and South China Seas, but the result was merely a \u201ccandid\u201d conversation. \u201cPresident Trump noted the importance of adhering to international rules and norms in the East and South China Seas and to previous statements on \u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement. Human Rights, Tillerson remarked that America\u2019s commitment to human rights was \u201cquite clear\u201d throughout all their discussions, but it appears that specific offenses were not discussed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to have a separate conversation, somehow separate our core values around human rights from our economic discussions, our    discussions, or our foreign policy discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really embedded in every discussion, that that is really what guides much of our view around how we\u2019re going to work together. \u201d Spicer said in a statement that Trump \u201cnoted the importance of protecting human rights and other values deeply held by Americans\u201d during the visit.
