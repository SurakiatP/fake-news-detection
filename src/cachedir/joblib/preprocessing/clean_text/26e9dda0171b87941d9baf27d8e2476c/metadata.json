They saved our collective dignity, by accepting, accommodating, and educating distressed refugees. \u201d The former economy minister, who announced his presidential candidacy in   added it was a \u201cdisgusting simplification\u201d when Merkel was accused of surrendering her own capital and the whole of Europe with the admission of over one million migrants from the Middle East and Africa.
