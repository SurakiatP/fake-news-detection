A federal appeals court refused to reinstate President Trump\u2019s targeted travel ban, delivering a stinging judicial rebuke to his administration. The ruling focused on the narrow question of whether the ban should be blocked while courts consider its lawfulness, and is likely to be quickly appealed to the Supreme Court. The executive order suspended travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries and limited the nation\u2019s refugee program. Above, families were reunited in Chicago this week. _____ 2. An \u201cunusually fast and intense\u201d snowstorm shut down cities across the Northeast. Up to 14 inches fell across the New York area, and parts of New England could get up to 18 inches. Some places got a rare \u201cthundersnow,\u201d which is   \u2026     exactly what it sounds like. _____ 3. Concerns over conflicts of interest pushed the White House to \u201ccounsel\u201d a top Trump adviser. Kellyanne Conway may have violated federal ethics rules by urging people to buy Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion products during a television appearance. That came just a day after Mr. Trump lashed out at Nordstrom for dropping his daughter\u2019s line of clothes, jewelry and accessories. On today\u2019s episode of our podcast, The Daily, we get an influential investor\u2019s take on the postelection market euphoria and discuss how the Republicans empowered Senator Elizabeth Warren. Listen here if you\u2019re on a computer, here if you have an iOS device or here for an Android device. _____ 4. A    Arizona woman who illegally crossed the border from Mexico when she was 14 was deported amid protests and tears. The immigration officials she met with regularly for years declined to carry out a deportation order  \u2014   until the Trump administration broadened the definition of \u201ccriminal alien,\u201d which may affect the majority of unauthorized immigrants. \u201cThe only crime my mother committed was to go to work to give a better life for her children,\u201d her daughter said. _____ 5. Friday is the anniversary of the 1979 revolution that established the Islamic Republic of Iran, but some Iranians don\u2019t want to join in the tradition, cherished among   of burning American flags. Many Iranians were heartened by the backlash to Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, which targeted Iran and six other nations. \u201cLook at the kindness Iranians received at U. S. airports by those protesting Trump,\u201d said one. \u201cWe insult those people when we burn their flag. \u201d _____ 6. Mr. Trump and his advisers appear to be curtailing their provocative   moves as they develop a strategy on the   conflict that enlists Arab nations like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to break years of gridlock. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who is set to visit the United States next week, has been focused on trying to counter the rise of Iran with the same regional allies. _____ 7. Mystery assassinations in eastern Ukraine: Half a dozen commanders in the   separatist army have been killed far from the front lines since 2015. Ukrainian officials deny any involvement, and say the deaths could be infighting  \u2014   or efforts by Russia to consolidate control by eliminating erratic, if popular, local commanders on their own side. _____ 8. They don\u2019t talk about it much, but almost half of all Americans in their early 20s get parental help to pay the rent. Those in the art and design fields get the most help, an average of $3, 600 a year. It\u2019s a new example of how economic advantages continue well into the opening chapters of adulthood, giving young people from wealthier families more time to develop skills that can lead to higher incomes. _____ 9. Bob Costas is ending his   run as NBC\u2019s   Olympics host. When the network goes to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, next year, the baton will be passed to Mike Tirico, who recently joined NBC from ESPN. Mr. Costas will also scale back his other work at NBC, and focus on offering commentary and features for major events. _____ 10. Finally, what makes a good dancer? Researchers asked 200 people to rate 39 avatars based on female dancers, an experiment in what they call \u201csocial cognition\u201d  \u2014   how bits of perceptual information feed large inferences. The conclusion: It\u2019s all about the hips. One of the study\u2019s authors helpfully suggested that \u201cthere is no harm in trying to throw different moves at the disco. \u201d _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
