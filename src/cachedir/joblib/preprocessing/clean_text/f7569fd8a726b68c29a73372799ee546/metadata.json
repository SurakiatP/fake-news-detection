I really like my show, and I love my team. But, you know, there's a lot of brain damage that comes from the job,\u201d she told Variety this spring. Image Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for People.com \\nIn an \u201cexclusive\u201d report from Breitbart, the bigwigs at the network were purportedly forming an alliance to \u201cblock\u201d her, and in an eye-opening bit of potential foreshadowing for TrumpTV , the website wrote: \\nAt least one top talent inside Fox News has confirmed to Breitbart News that a major talent meeting among various different hosts is scheduled, and they are considering leaving with Roger Ailes to form a new network to compete with Fox. \\n\u201cEveryone here hates Gretchen and Megyn,\u201d the anonymous source reportedly told the website. Gretchen Carlson would later leave Fox News . \\nOf course, Roger Ailes was to be forced out after he was blitzed by sexual harassment accusations from a number of female employees, including a claim by Megyn Kelly. New York Magazine reported : \\nAccording to two sources briefed on parent company 21st Century Fox\u2019s outside probe of the Fox News executive, led by New York\u2013based law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly has told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. Kelly, according to the sources, has described her harassment by Ailes in detail.

Recently, Vanity Fair published a story that the two media potentates had a \u201c falling out .\u201d \\nIn August, Fox News appointed two executives to attempt filling Ailes' shoes: Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, who were named as co-presidents. Due to a colossal media merger of AT&T and Time Warner, CNN executive Jeff Zucker is believed by some to have the inside track on taking over at Fox News. The Hollywood Reporter writes : \\nCNN\u2019s Jeff Zucker who, having worked for GE when he ran NBC, might be considered a more logical bridge to AT&T and, if rebuffed, might likely be open to the Murdoch sons' interest in having him come to run Fox News. \\nThe Murdoch brothers are not believed to share their father's conservative sensibilities, and thus there are concerns that the two would reshape the network into a much less conservative one. Image Credit: Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images \\nWith Sean Hannity riding high as a conservative pundit on the strength of his vocal Trump support, his ratings have even eclipsed Kelly's... at least for now. There is a strong belief by many that the host's unwavering support is an audition for TrumpTV, should The Donald lose the election. \\nIt's in this tumultuous environment \u2014 filled with intrigue at the network and turmoil across the media landscape \u2014 that Megyn Kelly's future has become uncertain. A leaked discussion of her contract negotiations sheds more light. \\nAs reported by Politico: \\nContract negotiations between Megyn Kelly and Fox News Channel have spilled into the media, with Fox News interim CEO Rupert Murdoch talking on the record to The Wall Street Journal (which he also owns via his other company, News Corp.) about the matter. \\nAccording to the Journal's Joe Flint, \u201cMr. Murdoch said in an interview that she is important to the network and he hopes to get a contract signed 'very soon,' but noted, 'it\u2019s up to her.'\u201d \\nThen Murdoch hinted, not unsubtly, \u201cWe have a deep bench of talent, many of whom would give their right arm for her spot.\u201d \\nAs noted by the publication, Kelly is shopping around her talents as well, booking an expected appearance as co-host of ABC's \u201cLive with Kelly!\u201d Image Credit: Paul Morigi/Getty Images \\nMegyn Kelly is also seeking a more lucrative contract: \\nFlint reports that Kelly, who will make around $15 million this year, is aiming to get north of $20 million per year with her new contract. He also said he wants to keep Bill O'Reilly on as the channel's 8 PM host. O'Reilly's contract is also up next year. \\nMurdoch also attempted to put rumors of a less conservative Fox News outlet to rest in the Wall Street Journal interview: \\n\u201cWe\u2019re not changing direction\u2026that would be business suicide.\u201d \\nIf TrumpTV indeed becomes a reality, the winds of change may shift again. Fox News will have a very different look \u2014 with or without Megyn Kelly \u2014 as a feud looms over who is the real \u201cconservative\u201d leader in cable news. \""}, "time": 1742562462.234726}
