In other words, M.A.D. recognized and accepted the fact that for a nuclear power to attack a nuclear power with non-nuclear weaponry will almost certainly provoke a nuclear war at the moment when one of the two is losing (or about to lose) the conventional conflict to the other. Nuclear weapons are weapons of last resort, but they exist in order to prevent defeat. That is what they exist for. If Japan had had deliverable nuclear weapons, then the end of World War II would have been considerably delayed. Japan would have lost because it \\nBut M.A.D. is not just a physical reality but equally importantly a mutually-shared belief-system, a belief-system that becomes no longer operative if one of the two sides switches to believe that a way exists actually to win a nuclear war\u2014in other words, to believe that conquest of a nuclear power by another nuclear power is a real possibility. During the years prior to 2006, there was an increasing though unspoken belief at the top of the US aristocracy (the people who control the US government\u2014or at least have controlled it since 1981 ), that the United States would be able to win a nuclear war against Russia; and, suddenly, in 2006, the belief was published, and virtually no one who possessed power or influence challenged it; and, from that time forward, M.A.D. was ended on the American side, and nuclear weapons became, in the US, strategized within a new framework (called \u201cnuclear primacy\u201d \\nAfter 1991, when the Warsaw Pact no longer existed, the US military alliance NATO invited into its membership all of the former states of the USSR except Russia (thereby indicating NATO\u2019s continuing hostility toward that particular nation and the fraudulence of NATO\u2019s peace with it), and also invited in all of the USSR\u2019s former Warsaw Pact allies, and so NATO (a now clearly anti-Russian, no longer at all anti-communist, alliance) has come to extend right up to Rus \\nConsequently, in the current US-NATO operation on and near Russia\u2019s borders , the Alliance is starting the buildup of its traditional invasion forces. This includes even some US allies that are not in NATO . The supposed \u2018justification\u2019 for this amassing of invasion-forces on Russia\u2019s borders is to \u2018defend\u2019 against \u2018Russia\u2019s aggression\u2019 when (in March 2014 just weeks after the bloody US coup in Ukraine ) Russia enabled the residents of Crimea to rejoin Crimea as part of Russia, of which Crimea had been until the Soviet dictator Khrushchev arbitrarily transferred Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 . That disagreement about Crimea is the supposed root-cause for NATO\u2019s involvement, even though Ukraine still is not (and previously did not want to be) a member of the NATO alliance. Anyway: is the rationalization for NATO\u2019s buildup toward what could become WW III. \\nEver since 19 February 2016, the US has been storing tanks and artillery , sufficient \u201cto support 15,000 Marines,\u201d in undisclosed \u201cconfidential,\u201d Norwegian caves. Norway has a 200-mile border with Russia. CNN\u2019s news-report on that was accompanied by a video headlined \u201cRussia Reveals Aggressive Military Plans\u201d . It reported that Russia\u2019s (democratically elected, though not mentioned as such) President, Vladimir Putin, was moving troops and weapons toward Norway\u2019s border. (How would the US respond if Russia were to be storing invasion-equipment and troops in Mexico near the US border? Would the US be moving troops and weapons near the Mexican border to protect against an invasion of America; and, if so, then how accurate would it be if Russia\u2019s media then headlined \u201cAmerica Reveals Aggressive Military Plans\u201d? Hitler\u2019s Germany used those sorts of media-tactics, but this time Obama\u2019s America is doing that.) Marine Corps Times headlined on October 24 th , . \\nnd its greatly expanded NATO, thus now surrounds Russia not just with its tanks etc., but with its missiles and bombers, on and near Russia\u2019s borders, and so the flight-time from launch to the nuclear-bombing (if the ground-invasion of Russia encounters defeat) will be less than ten minutes, sometimes even less than the time for Russia to get its own missiles launched in retaliation against ours; and so a US blitz nuclear attack against Russia could conceivably be an entirely one-sided war. Here is how that scenario\u2014the end of physical M.A.D.\u2014has actually become the objective sought by the US government (and the necessary backstory for America\u2019s war-drills on Russia\u2019s borders): \\nIn 2006, the US aristocracy published in the journal Foreign Affairs, from their Council on Foreign Relations, the first article which said that the US goal should no longer be a continuation of M.A.D., but instead \u201cThe Rise of US Nuclear Primacy\u201d , by which the US aristocracy meant the rise of America\u2019s ability to win a nuclear war against Russia. It established this stunning goal merely by saying that such an objective could be achieved and that it should be achieved, and by the article\u2019s being published by the US aristocracy itself (the people who control this country), and by furthermore the US aristocracy not condemning and rejecting and repudiating it but simply letting that article stand with little to no public discussion (and no public debate) about it, much less with the chorus of public condemnations of it in the US press, such as would have happened if America were a democracy\u2014but this nation no longer is a democracy, it has become an aristocracy , and this aristocracy had now published the \u201cNuclear Primacy,\u201d article. (By contras \u201cThe Fallacy of Nuclear Primacy\u201d . That article had no impact.) \\nThe Foreign Affairs article even was so bold as to assert that \u201cUS leaders have always aspired to this goal,\u201d (nuclear primacy)\u2014a wild and unsupported allegation that\u2019s not much different from alleging that not only George W. Bush but all US Presidents after World War II were aspiring to have the ability to conquer Russia (and the authors were asserting that only now was this supposedly terrific ability coming within reach). It was explicit about G.W. Bush\u2019s having this desire: \u201cThe intentional pursuit of nuclear primacy is, moreover, entirely consistent with the United States\u2019 declared policy of expanding its global dominance. The Bush administration\u2019 started the determined policy to achieve nuclear primacy) was so dangerous and harmful a President. His invasion of Iraq was merely a sympton of that deeper disease. \\nAnd, so, this article about \u201cThe Rise of US Nuclear Primacy,\u201d and \u201cThe End of,\u201d M.A.D., was now\u2014since it was published by the CFR and not rejected by any influential group\u2014accepted within the US as a goal, \u201cNuclear Primacy,\u201d which the US government could and should strive for. That idea, of a winnable nuclear war (winnable by the US, of course), was no longer heretical, no longer viewed as repugnant. In fact, this article had been introduced and accepted by Harvard University simultaneously in its longer form and simultaneously published by their scholarly journal International Security, wh \u201cThe End of MAD?\u201d . (The periods are customarily removed from the acronym \u201cM.A.D.,\u201d perhaps in order to associate the M.A.D. concept with the pejorative term, insanity. \\ndestroy the world ). \\nUS President Barack Obama is putting the goal of nuclear primacy into place, starting with implementation of Ronald Reagan\u2019s proposed \u201cStar Wars,\u201d Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) defense system, now called the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, and technically called by the name of its current embodiment: Lockheed Martin\u2019s, Boeing\u2019s, and Raytheon\u2019s, Aegis Ashore system, which Obama first made operational in Romania on 12 May 2016 . It\u2019s designed so as to enable a surprise nuclear attack against Russia in which any missiles that Russia might be able to launch in retaliation will supposedly (if the system works 100%) be annihilated during their launch-phase. \\nObama came into office criticizing the ABM plan and pretending not to be hostile toward Russia. He deceived Vladimir Putin into thinking that Obama sincerely wanted to pursue peace and cooperation with Russia. As soon as Obama became re-elected, his verbal smiling teeth immediately became actual glaring fangs. Then, soon after his regime overthrew in a bloody February 2014 coup the Moscow-friendly democratically elected President of Ukraine, bordering Russia , Russia started in the summer of 2014 to ignore the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, because for Washington the next step (beyond Ukraine) clearly now would be Moscow and so all bets were off. The installation of the Aegis Ashore in Romania , which is one important reason why Obama lies to say that all of the Aegis Ashore facilities will be targeted against Iran\u2014and maybe also North Korea\u2014but never against Russia. \\nThe full Aegis Ashore system, which will require several such sites, is not yet operational. NATO\u2019s PR-arm the Atlantic Council, has mentioned among the Aegis Ashore\u2019s benefits, that for the next such site, in Poland, \u201cPoland announced in late April that it would buy eight Patriot missile batteries from Virginia-based Raytheon Co. in a deal that could generate at least $2.5 billion in US export content.\u201d The US government officials and their friends who have invested in Raytheon and the other \u2018defense\u2019 firms did not need to be informed of this by any PR person. They already knew of it from more reliable sources, and perhaps they even have invested in nuclear bunkers for themselves and their friends and their friends\u2019 friends \\nAlso in 2006, later in that year, specifically on 18 November 2006, was published at Global Research, which is an independent Canadian online international site dealing with geostrategy, a superb summary of the connection that this plan has to America\u2019s string of invasions in the Middle East. It\u2019s titled \u201cPlans for Redrawing the Middle East: The Project for a \u2018New Middle East,\u2019\u201d \\nIt should be noted that in his book, \u201cThe Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geo-strategic Imperatives,\u201d Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former US National Security Advisor, alluded to the modern Middle East as a control lever of an area he, Brzezinski, calls the Eurasian Balkans. The Eurasian Balkans consists of the Caucasus (Georgia, the Republic of Azerbaijan, and Armenia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan) and to some extent both Iran and Turkey. Iran and Turkey both form the northernmost tiers of the Middle East (excluding the Caucasus4) that edge into Europe and the former Soviet Union. \\nThe Map of the \u201cNew Middle East\u201d \\nA relatively unknown map of the Middle East, NATO-garrisoned Afghanistan, and Pakistan has been circulating around strategic, governmental, NATO, policy and military circles since mid-2006. It has been casually allowed to surface in public, maybe in an attempt to build consensus and to slowly prepare the general public for possible, maybe even cataclysmic, changes in the Middle East. This is a map of a redrawn and restructured Middle East identified as the \u201cNew Middle East.\u201d \\nMAP OF THE NEW MIDDLE EAST \\nNote: The map was prepared by Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters. It was published in the Armed Forces Journal in June 2006, Peters is a retired colonel of the US National War Academy. (Map Copyright Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters 2006). \\nAlthough the map does not officially reflect Pentagon doctrine, it has been used in a training program at NATO\u2019s Defense College for senior military officers. This map, as well as other similar maps, has most probably been used at the National War Academy as well as in military planning circles. \\nBrzezinski\u2019s advocacy of \u201cAmerican Primacy,\u201d fits perfectly with the aristocracy\u2019s support of \u201cNuclear Primacy,\u201d and appeared eight years before it. His 1998 book was seminal also in many other ways. And, as that Nazemroaya article made clear, Brzezinski\u2019s plan was already being put into effect by the US government, even before 2006. \\nHowever, the person who actually made the seminal decision behind all of this, the decision to conquer Russia, was US President George Herbert Walker Bush, on the night of 24 February 1990, just before the Soviet Union ended. He was the person who decided that after the USSR and its Warsaw Pact terminated, NATO would continue that cold war until Russia has been surrounded by US allies, who are Russia\u2019s enemies, when Russia will ultimately either surrender or else be destroyed by the US and its friends. \\nEven if Russia assumes that any such nuclear war would be M.A.D., the government of the US no longer does. That\u2019sRussia\u2019s predicament\u2014and the world\u2019s . \\nHowever, military planners in the US and its vassal nations, do not include in their calculations the world: the impacts that such nuclear winter and all the rest will have if their dream of \u2018nuclear primacy\u2019 amounts to anything more than merely the vicious hoax that it is. This fact, of their ignoring the world, is scandalous\u2014against our military planners. They are so obsessed with \u2018victory,\u2019 that they are willing to participate in this false and potentially mega-catastrophic dream, of \u2018nuclear primacy.\u2019 \\nUnless and until nuclear weapons are totally eliminated (which might never happen), their constructive function, of preventing WW III, must continue, not end as a result of \u2018nuclear primacy\u2019 and other such lies and delusions. However, the \u2018news\u2019 media, especially in \u2018The West,\u2019 are not pointing out those lies and distortions, but instead reinforcing them. \\nIf there is to be a WW III, it will end the world . That is the key fact, which is ignored by \u2018The West\u2019s\u2019 military planners. \\nNATO needs to end now, just as the Warsaw Pact did in 1991\u2014when an indecent, oligarchic , \u2018The West\u2019 continued the Cold War despite the Warsaw Pact\u2019s end, and now is making it hot. \\nThis article originally appeared in Strategic Culture Foundation on-line journal. \\nInvestigative historian Eric Zuesse is the author, most recently, of \u201cThey\u2019re Not Even Close: The Democratic vs. Republican Economic Records, 1910\u20132010,: This entry was posted in Analysis .
