[\u201cI\u2019ve been over to Iraq twice in the last year, the last time with Congressman Chris Smith, taking a look at how Christians were being overlooked by the aid program of the U. S. government, getting basically no money from the U. S. or the UN,\u201d Walther said.  LISTEN: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve discovered and been advocating against at this point is that these people are really being left out,\u201d he said. \u201cISIS came in, killed a lot of them, drove them all from their homes in Nineveh and elsewhere. The upshot of that was the U. S. just sort of stood by, did not have a plan for helping communities. \u201d  \u201cNow I think we have the opportunity to change things,\u201d said Walther. \u201cThese people faced genocide once, then they faced the sort of overlooking by the U. S. and now I\u2019m told that there are signs that things are starting to change  \u2014   that there\u2019s a new openness among government officials there in Iraq, U. S. government officials, to helping these communities that have been overlooked for so long. \u201d  \u201cHow this happened was simply a matter of an argument that we have to take care of everybody, so all the money goes to the big camps,\u201d he explained. \u201cChristians don\u2019t go to the big camps because, of course, they get persecuted and targeted for violence at the big camps, and so, as a result, they get nothing because there\u2019s no thought about prioritizing, or even helping, or making sure that you don\u2019t leave out these little communities that could disappear. In the case of Christians, their numbers have declined in Iraq by almost 90 percent in the last decade. \u201d Walther said he found some of the reactions to President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration \u201cvery confusing. \u201d \u201cThe idea that we would prioritize people for religious persecution  \u2014   people who had suffered, in the case of several of these countries, genocide  \u2014   and it was religious minorities in general, let\u2019s be clear: It wasn\u2019t just Christians. Yazidis, Mandaeans, Shabak  \u2014   I mean, there were a lot of people that were targeted like this. When you look at that, and you see this reaction, you have to wonder if these people have missed the history lesson on what the U. S. has done for the past hundred years,\u201d he said.  \u201cAfter World War I, we prioritized the Christian community in the Middle East because it was almost completely destroyed by the Ottoman genocide of 1915 and \u201916 and again in \u201922. It was the U. S. that stepped in,   partnerships, the State Department was involved, the whole bit,\u201d Walther explained.  \u201cSecond, after World War II, the U. S. takes an enormous number of Jewish refugees from Europe. Why? Not because there weren\u2019t as many or more refugees from the German, French, and Italian populations, but because everybody understood that they had faced genocide, and they needed a special kind of priority. That didn\u2019t mean that other refugees didn\u2019t get in. It just meant that the Jewish refugees  \u2014   and you can see this in the numbers  \u2014   got some priority,\u201d he said.  \u201cEven more recently, you\u2019ve had Democratic sponsorship of things like the Lautenberg Amendment, which prioritizes religious minorities from Iran, which are Christians, Jews, and those of the Baha\u2019i faith,\u201d he noted. \u201cSuddenly, we have an executive order that says we\u2019re going to prioritize religious minorities, and it\u2019s the end of the world. I really don\u2019t understand why that is, and I don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t understand that this has been the U. S. policy for a very long time. \u201d Marlow quoted from Walther\u2019s   a passage in which he noted that only   of one percent of Syrian refugees admitted into the U. S. in 2016 were Christians, even though they make up ten percent of the Syrian population. \u201cCertainly, it\u2019s a de facto inequity, and I think you\u2019ve seen a lot of the    \u2014   I was looking at one this morning  \u2014   that are making the case that refugees from other countries are getting in at a greater rate. Christians are getting in from Iran, Iraq, and these other places, so what the president said about Syria is wrong,\u201d said Walther.  \u201cNo, what the president said about Syria is actually right. It has been very hard for Christians to get in,\u201d he argued. \u201cA lot of people are saying that it\u2019s not really discrimination they don\u2019t want to come in. I got an email two days ago from the Syriac Catholic patriarch, who I would imagine knows what\u2019s going on with his people, who tells me they do want to get in. They\u2019re applying for refugee status, and they never hear back from places like the U. S. and Canada. They\u2019re ignored, or they\u2019re rejected. So which is it? I\u2019ve got to believe that he knows what he\u2019s talking about. \u201d  \u201cI was with the archbishop of Aleppo two years ago. He stood on our stage, and he said, \u2018What\u2019s happening, in terms of the refugee system, is unjust.\u2019 I think these guys who are living in places like Aleppo know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. Walther was confident the CPAC audience understands \u201cthe importance of protecting religious minorities around the world, the importance of human rights\u201d and that \u201cthreats to human rights can have a religious nature. \u201d \u201cI think that people here also, you see there is support in the polling, and there is support in general, I think especially in groups like this, for making sure that we don\u2019t overlook these minorities in the Middle East,\u201d he added. Marlow asked if the Knights of Columbus have experienced any decline in membership or influence due to the \u201csecularization of America. \u201d \u201cNo, we have found a consistent way to grow for   years,\u201d Walther replied. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that I think people get excited about the kinds of things we do. They get excited about the work we do on the   issue. They get excited about the work that we do in communities around the country to help our neighbors. They get excited about issues like helping Christians in the Middle East. The persecution of Christians in the Middle East gets our guys fired up. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve raised more than $12 million for these people on this issue,\u201d he announced. \u201cI think we have a very strong network in the U. S. and also internationally, of guys that are really committed to their faith and also to helping in a variety of ways. \u201d When Marlow asked how much of a setback the eight years of Obama were for the cause of helping persecuted Christians in the Middle East, Walther cited criticism from his friend the Archbishop of Erbil that \u201cit was a mistake for your country to come here in 2003, and it was a bigger mistake for you to leave in 2011. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the guy taking care of 100, 000 Christians in Erbil,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou have a situation where once this happened in 2014, once ISIS rolled through, the U. S. basically did nothing for these minority communities. We let them die. We let the ISIS program of dechristianization and sort of radicalizing of the region just occur without any kind of input. We let the Yazidis go. We let the Mandeans go. All of these little groups that have been there for thousands of years were not prioritized, were not even paid attention to.
