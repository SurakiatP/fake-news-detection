Trump\u2019s plans to upend government, and marveling at how he had forced his fellow Republicans in the House to reverse themselves on gutting the Office of Congressional Ethics. \u201cHe\u2019s getting responses things are happening,\u201d Jerry Retzlaff, a retiree, said. \u201cHe got Congress to turn themselves around with one tweet. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no secret the press doesn\u2019t like him, and neither does a lot of the leadership,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because he\u2019s planning on making a lot of changes. \u201d The eight men around a rectangular table, sipping coffee from a hodgepodge of mugs donated by customers, meet daily for breakfasts of French toast, eggs and bacon at Darrell\u2019s diner, all while solving the world\u2019s problems, hence their gathering\u2019s nickname. Washington may be veering from one Trump   controversy to another: unproved reports of Russia\u2019s holding embarrassing information against him, possible ethical conflicts, the donors and billionaires of his cabinet, his pushback against intelligence findings on Russian hacking in the election. But there does not seem to be much angst in Iowa among those who voted for Mr. Trump, including some Democrats and independents. Monticello, in rural eastern Iowa, is as close as any place to the epicenter of the political quake that made Mr. Trump president. The state\u2019s longstanding reputation as a political bellwether had led The New York Times to move me to Iowa for a full year ahead of its presidential caucuses in early 2016. I had not returned since. In the intervening year, Iowa gave  Mr. Trump his largest triumph of any battleground state: a    reversal over President Obama\u2019s easy victory here in 2012. Al Ameling, 58, a technical analyst who lives in Marble Rock, near the Minnesota border, is representative of the profound demographic shift among white rural voters in the northern Midwest that helped produce Mr. Trump\u2019s stunning upset. Mr. Ameling voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, sat out in 2012 and enthusiastically backed Mr. Trump. Nothing he has heard since Election Day has shaken his support, including reports this week that American intelligence agencies are investigating unverified accounts of meetings between Trump aides and Russian officials, as well as sex tapes purportedly made of Mr. Trump in Moscow. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the allegations completely false. \u201cThe way it is nowadays, unless I see positive proof, it\u2019s all a lie,\u201d Mr. Ameling said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. He added he was more concerned that government officials might have leaked the material to the news media. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was classified, but if it was, whoever leaked it needs to go to jail,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need law and order back in this country. \u201d I headed to Monticello because it was the site of Hillary Clinton\u2019s first campaign stop after declaring her candidacy for the Democratic nomination in 2015. When she rolled up in her black van, a pack of journalists took off at a run, myself included, an enduringly silly image. Mrs. Clinton rarely returned to the state in the general election campaign, giving it up as all but lost. Jones County, which includes Monticello, is the birthplace of the painter Grant Wood, and where older men still wear the style of pinstriped overalls in his \u201cAmerican Gothic. \u201d It is a beautiful place, with bald eagles soaring over wintry farm fields. Mr. Trump carried the county by 20 percentage points Mr. Obama easily won there four years earlier. At Darrell\u2019s, there are actually two Tables of Knowledge, one favored by Democrats and the other by Republicans. Among them are an optometrist, farmers and former employees of a utility company. I asked if there was anyone who had voted for Mr. Trump after having previously supported Mr. Obama. \u201cYeah, there is, but they won\u2019t tell you,\u201d said Mr. Retzlaff, an outspoken conservative who usually chooses to sit with the liberals. Mel Manternach, a retired farmer, said many farmers who had once voted for Mr. Obama switched to Mr. Trump, which he found perplexing. \u201cTrump was against T. P. P. which would help exports of ag commodities,\u201d he said, referring to the   Partnership, a   deal. \u201cThey voted against their own  . \u201d The Iowans I interviewed largely went about their lives outside the political hothouse of social media. They did not follow    developments of the presidential transition. Indeed, on Wednesday, several were unfamiliar with the reports that Russia was holding compromising information on the   which Mr. Trump addressed in a news conference. Many were hazy on specific policy details about how, say, House Republicans were seeking to replace Medicare with a voucher system. These voters feared an outbreak of   terrorist attacks by Muslims in the United States, maybe in their own communities. And overwhelmingly, Trump supporters did not want their   money redistributed to people they regarded as undeserving. A year ago, I shadowed a Clinton   in Newton, a small city in central Iowa that has struggled since Maytag closed a washing machine plant. Jeff McKibben, one of the   workers, traded down for work at a prison. Once a \u201cstraight Democrat,\u201d as he called himself, he refused to commit at the time to support Mrs. Clinton. Contacted recently, he did not want to say how he voted, although Jasper County, which includes Newton, was one of the more than 30 Iowa counties that swung to Mr. Trump from Mr. Obama. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to have some change,\u201d Mr. McKibben allowed. \u201cI saw neighbors I knew were strong union people with Trump signs in their yards. \u201d The story was the same in Des Moines County, in southeastern Iowa. The local Democratic Party chairwoman, Sandy Dockendorff, knew there was trouble when she saw a Trump sign in the yard of an electrician who had always supported Democrats. \u201cWhen I called him,\u201d Ms. Dockendorff explained last month to a group of demoralized activists at a United Steelworkers union hall, \u201che said, \u2018You stopped talking my language you don\u2019t care about jobs.\u2019 \u201d In an interview, Ms. Dockendorff, who is running for chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said rural Iowans were critical of Democrats for opposing   projects like oil pipelines while running a presidential campaign focused narrowly on Mr. Trump\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cIt was all about making fun of Donald Trump  \u2014   he would never be president and how horrible it would be,\u201d she said. But \u201cthe only one talking about jobs was Trump,\u201d Ms. Dockendorff added. At a Des Moines County diner in Burlington, a small city on the Mississippi River, Melissa Ell, a waitress, said she had voted for Mr. Obama in 2012. But this Election Day, she stayed home. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to vote for either one of them, to be honest,\u201d she said. Ms. Ell, 46, earns a base wage of $6. 50 an hour at Jerry\u2019s Main Lunch, a   restaurant across from the Burlington Northern Railroad tracks. As she bused a table, Ms. Ell commiserated with Jackie Furman about those who take advantage of government aid. \u201cI think they should be   if they\u2019re on welfare,\u201d Ms. Ell said. \u201cThe welfare system needs to be reorganized,\u201d agreed Ms. Furman, a retired commercial bakery manager, complaining that \u201cChicago people\u201d were moving to Burlington to receive higher benefits and bringing crime. Ms. Furman, 70, said, \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say we caucused for Obama\u201d in 2008. \u201cMy view is he purposely got into the presidency so he could ruin America. \u201d There are contrary views. On Washington Street in Burlington, I expected Post 10102 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to be a bastion of support for the   who had promised repeatedly to \u201ctake care of the vets. \u201d But there was deep skepticism. \u201cForget about me,\u201d Dan Meade, a Navy veteran, said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to our kids, our grandkids? I think the guy\u2019s nuts. \u201d He and three others sipped $1. 50 draft beers from plastic cups. They sarcastically echoed notable Trump lines from the campaign trail. \u201cHe knows more than the generals he doesn\u2019t like prisoners of war,\u201d Dan Warren, an Army veteran, said. \u201cWhen Trump was running for office he said he\u2019d run the country like he runs his companies,\u201d Fran Boyle, who served in the Navy, chimed in. \u201cWhich one of his bankrupt companies is he going to run it like?\u201d Still, Trump voters in the state say they are hoping for the best. Mike Staudt, a retired farmer from Marble Rock, voted for Mr. Obama in 2012, but called the Affordable Care Act a form of socialism. He said he had no problem with a candidate who had run as the voice of the working people but was stocking his cabinet with the ultrawealthy. \u201cI know these guys are really rich,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may have pulled off a few plays that weren\u2019t exactly on the    but they all had to be pretty smart to be billionaires. If they replace their own concerns with the concerns of the country, they can make things really move forward. That\u2019s what I\u2019m excited about. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561687.820447}
