[Donald Trump delivered the most finely crafted speech of his political life Tuesday night in what will go down as one of the best speeches delivered to a joint session of Congress in the past two decades.  He hit stirring emotional high notes. And he laid out his vision for his presidency. Mr. Trump stole the issue of affordable health care from Democrats. He unabashedly owned the fight against illegal immigration. \u201cObamacare is collapsing  \u2014   and we must act decisively to protect all Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cAction is not a choice  \u2014   it is a necessity. \u201d In other words, Democrats led by President Obama swindled poor Americans into this disastrous program with their usual host of lies and false promises, and now these good people are stranded. But Mr. Trump and Republicans are not going to leave these innocent Americans to dig themselves out of the mess Democrats put them in. \u201cSo I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. \u201d When the camera panned to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  \u2014   who, inexplicably, is still the Democratic leader in the House  \u2014   she looked like she had been sucking on the bitterest of lemons. Strategically, it was brilliant. It completely cuts Democrats out of the debate. And then the president\u2019s salute to Megan Crowley, who is alive today because of the herculean efforts by her father to find a drug to combat Pompe disease, sealed the deal. Mr. Trump then laid out the broad brush parameters of a health care law he would like to see Republicans hammer out to replace Obamacare. On illegal immigration, Mr. Trump held firm. \u201cTo any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or a loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defends its borders?\u201d Another question he might have asked those in Congress who do not believe in enforcing immigration laws: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the immigration laws, why don\u2019t you change them? You are the only branch of government that can. \u201d Mr. Trump also deplored the hellfire violence in Chicago and called education \u201cthe civil rights issue of our time. \u201d The senator from Illinois and other Democrats offered only the most paltry, perfunctory applause. The entire speech was supremely presidential. But it wasn\u2019t without humor. After excoriating both Democrats and Republicans for spending $6 trillion in the Middle East, he said, \u201cWe could have rebuilt our country  \u2014   twice. \u201d He waited two beats. \u201cAnd maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to   \u2026     negotiate,\u201d Mr. Trump said, dropping into his finest \u201cApprentice\u201d tone of voice. The camera panned to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was exchanging perplexed glances with an equally befuddled senator. They didn\u2019t get the line. Apparently, Ms. Warren never achieved her merit badge for reading smoke signals. In the end, Donald Trump so dominated the entire night that Democrats were left with nothing but sullen protests. The ladies wore white, but nobody was exactly sure why. In a shocking development, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not doze off during the hourlong address. At least not on national television. She did not show up. And in another development that absolutely nobody cared about, Rep. Eliot Engel, New York Democrat, announced he would not shake Mr. Trump\u2019s hand. It was not clear at press time if Mr. Trump even knows who Eliot Engel is. There were so many protests on the Democratic side of the aisle, it was hard to keep track. Even the Democrats seemed confused about what they were protesting. Rep. Joseph Crowley, New York Democrat, wore a giant pin protesting, well, not sure exactly what. It simply featured a large question mark. In all honesty, that pin could be the party\u2019s entire platform in the next election. \u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes. com follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.'"}, "time": 1742563530.2754908}
