[On Monday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, Robby Mook, demanded Trump\u2019s campaign aides be \u201cprosecuted for treason\u201d if evidence emerges of coordination with Moscow during the recent presidential campaign.  One day later, on Tuesday, Michael Winship, senior writer for BillMoyers. com, wrote an opinion piece titled, \u201c\u2018There\u2019s a Smell of Treason in the Air\u2019\u201d Winship is a former senior writing fellow at the progressive advocacy group Demos, which is financed by billionaire George Soros. Winship\u2019s piece, which was republished at the Huffington Post, argued that last Monday\u2019s House Intelligence Committee hearing that probed alleged ties between the Trump administration and Russia was \u201cproof positive of the absolute need for both a special prosecutor and an independent, bipartisan commission with subpoena power to conduct a full investigation\u201d on the matter. Last week, this reporter found serious problems with the main   charges at the hearing, delivered in opening remarks by Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on a House intelligence committee. The charges included wild conspiracy theories and heavy reliance on a questionable source. The title of Winship\u2019s article, meanwhile, comes from a quote in the Washington Post last week provided by presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who told the newspaper, \u201cThere\u2019s a smell of treason in the air. Imagine if J. Edgar Hoover or any other FBI director would have testified against a sitting president? It would have been a mindboggling event. \u201d Winship went on to compare the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to the Watergate scandal under the Nixon administration: During Schiff\u2019s questioning on Monday, Comey seemed to nod toward agreeing that Russia\u2019s hacking of the Democratic National Committee was not unlike the 1972 physical   at the DNC. You know, the one that precipitated the revelations, resignations and prison convictions of Watergate. Drip, drip, drip  \u2026     On Thursday, Nicholas Kristof wrote an oped in the New York Times using the same title as Winship, also citing Brinkley\u2019s quotes to the Washington Post. Kristof starts off his piece, titled, \u201c\u2018There\u2019s a Smell of Treason in the Air,\u2019\u201d by citing President Richard Nixon: The greatest political scandal in American history was not Aaron Burr\u2019s shooting of Alexander Hamilton, and perhaps wasn\u2019t even Watergate. Rather it may have been Richard Nixon\u2019s secret efforts in 1968 to sabotage a U. S. diplomatic effort to end the Vietnam War. Nixon\u2019s initiative, long rumored but confirmed only a few months ago, was meant to improve his election chances that year. After Nixon won, the war dragged on and cost thousands of additional American and Vietnamese lives it\u2019s hard to see his behavior as anything but treason. Like Winship, Kristof tries to link Trump to Nixon in order to make the \u201ctreason\u201d argument. \u201cNow the F. B. I. confirms that we have had an investigation underway for eight months into whether another presidential campaign colluded with a foreign power so as to win an election,\u201d Kristof wrote. \u201cTo me, that too would amount to treason. \u201d Kristof relied on his own \u201cintelligence experts\u201d who \u201cmostly (but not entirely) believe\u201d that there is a   connection. He wrote: I\u2019ve been speaking to intelligence experts, Americans and foreigners alike, and they mostly (but not entirely) believe there was   cooperation of some kind. But this is uncertain it\u2019s prudent to note that James Clapper, the intelligence director under Barack Obama, said that as of January he had seen no evidence of collusion but that he favors an investigation to get to the bottom of it. Kristof claimed he was \u201ctold (not by a Democrat!) that there\u2019s a persuasive piece of intelligence on ties between Russia and a member of the Trump team that isn\u2019t yet public. \u201d Kristof speculated the \u201cmost likely scenario for collusion seems fuzzier and less transactional than many Democrats anticipate. \u201d Despite there being no evidence of significant Trump investments in Russia, Kristof then guesses at what it might be  \u2014   alleged Trump investments in Russia: The Russians for years had influence over Donald Trump because of their investments with him, and he was by nature inclined to admire Vladimir Putin as a strongman ruler. Meanwhile, Trump had in his orbit a number of people with Moscow ties, including Paul Manafort, who practically bleeds borscht. The Times\u2019 columnist goes on to channel Winship and also demand the same talking point  \u2014   a \u201cpublic and bipartisan investigation by an independent commission. \u201d On cue, Rep. Ted Lieu ( ) warned Friday of a \u201ccloud of treason\u201d hanging over the Trump administration. \u201cThe bombshell revelation that US officials have information that suggests Trump associates may have colluded with the Russians means we must pause the entire Trump agenda,\u201d he said. Lieu called for the \u201ctotal and complete\u201d shutdown of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda in the wake of the claims. \u201cWe may have an illegitimate President of the United States currently occupying the White House,\u201d Lieu said in a statement. \u201cCongress cannot continue regular order and must stop voting on any   agenda item until the FBI completes its   collusion investigation. \u201d Lieu made similar \u201ctreason\u201d comments on Twitter. Cloud of treason means we must have total shutdown of any @POTUS agenda item. No votes on any item. My stmt https:  .  #GetWoke,  \u2014   Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 23, 2017,  Last week, Lieu also tweeted to Trump: \u201cYou truly are an evil man  \u2026    \u201d \u201dPresident\u201d @realDonaldTrump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. https:  .   \u2014   Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017,  Writing in the Washington Post on Friday, Jennifer Palmieri, Director of Communications for Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, also referenced \u201ctreason\u201d but from a different angle. \u201cIf Clinton had won with the help of the Russians, the Republicans would have impeachment proceedings underway for treason,\u201d she contended. \u201cNo doubt. Instead, dealing with Russia falls nearly solely on Democrats\u2019 shoulders. \u201d To Palmieri, the case is already closed. She writes that Trump won because of a Russian \u201cplot\u201d as if it were an established fact. \u201cNow that Trump is president, though, the stakes are higher because the Russian plot succeeded,\u201d Palmieri claims. Like Winship and Kristof, Palmieri references Watergate to make her point: \u201cThe possibility of collusion between Trump\u2019s allies and Russian intelligence is much more serious than Watergate. It is a constitutional crisis. It represents a violation of our republic\u2019s most sacred trust. \u201d Writing in The Week on Friday, senior correspondent Damon Linker also claims Trump could be guilty of \u201ctreason. \u201d Here is what I can\u2019t understand: FBI Director James Comey testified on Monday that Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is under investigation by the FBI over its potential ties to Russia. Let\u2019s be clear about what this might mean: treason. We don\u2019t yet know what the outcome of the investigation will be (though subsequent press reports have certainly underlined the importance of seeing it through to the end). But the very possibility that a sitting president and his circle could end up credibly accused of having advanced the interests of a hostile foreign power and of having colluded with that power in an effort to undermine the campaign of the president\u2019s political opponent should be more than enough to persuade Republican officeholders and pundits to treat the investigation with utmost seriousness  \u2014   and to distance themselves from the man at the center of the investigation until such time as he is cleared of any wrongdoing. And like the others, Linker likens the Russia claims to \u201cWatergate\u201d to advance the \u201ctreason\u201d narrative. Finally, there\u2019s the relative gravity of the allegations in the two scandals. The Watergate   itself was obviously a crime, but what led to Nixon\u2019s downfall was the   which implicated the president in multiple acts of obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. That would have been more than enough to impeach Nixon, remove him from office, and indict him. Bad? You bet. But far from treason. The allegations swirling around the Trump campaign are far more serious. Also on Friday, journalist Carl Bernstein  \u2014   who is known for breaking the Watergate story in 1972  \u2014   slammed Trump as \u201cmore treacherous\u201d than Nixon. Meanwhile, former Bill Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who has been working closely with the   MoveOn. org, penned a piece published in Newsweek arguing Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch \u201cshouldn\u2019t be confirmed until Trump comes clean\u201d about alleged ties to Russia. Like Lieu\u2019s reference to a \u201ccloud of treason\u201d hanging over the Trump administration, Reich claimed a \u201ctrue cloud of illegitimacy now hangs over the presidency of Donald Trump. \u201d Reich\u2019s piece was followed up by a MoveOn. org petition calling for Trump\u2019s agenda to be \u201cshut down\u201d while he is investigated over the Russia claims. The petition states: \u201cCongress must pause all   legislation and appointments \u2014  starting with a halt to Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation process \u2014  until the American people learn the full truth about Trump and Russia. \u201d In recent days, the hashtag #TrumpTreason has been trending on Twitter. Prominent users of the hashtag include Trump critic Rosie O\u2019Donnell, how about  \u2014   SCOTUS APPOINTMENTS SUSPENDED  \u2014   TIL THE INVESTIGATION IS OVER  \u2014   #TRUMPTREASON https:  .   \u2014   ROSIE (@Rosie) March 20, 2017,  This is not the first time this reporter documented the theme of   parroting similar   talking points. In February, a trend emerged in which news media outlets featured articles quoting health care professionals who questioned the billionaire\u2019s mental stability in a seeming bid to delegitimize the president. Following those reports, some Democratic politicians  \u2014   and at least one Republican  \u2014   called for Trump to be subjected to a psychiatric examination to determine whether he was fit for office. Some commentators have even suggested invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which allows for the   \u2019s removal from office if the \u201cpresident is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
