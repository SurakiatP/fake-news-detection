This week Trump unveiled details of his new economic plan, and the mainstream media is having a field day criticizing it . But the truth is that we simply cannot afford to stay on the same path that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have us on right now. Millions of jobs are being shipped out of the country , the middle class is dying , poverty is exploding , millions of children in America don\u2019t have enough food , and our reckless spending has created the biggest debt bubble in the history of the planet . Something must be done or else we will continue to steamroll toward economic oblivion. So is Donald Trump the man for the hour? \\nIf you would like to read his full economic plan, you can find it on his official campaign website . His plan starts off by pointing out that this has been the weakest \u201ceconomic recovery\u201d since the Great Depression\u2026 \\nLast week\u2019s GDP report showed that the economy grew a mere 1.2% in the second quarter and 1.2% over the last year. It\u2019s the weakest recovery since the Great Depression \u2013 the predictable consequence of massive taxation, regulation, one-side trade deals and onerous energy restrictions. \\nAnd Trump is exactly right about how weak this economic recovery has been. \\nSo how would he fix things? \\nThe following are 10 things that every American should know about Donald Trump\u2019s plan to save the U.S. economy\u2026 \\n#1 Donald Trump would lower taxes on the middle class \\nThe tax savings under Trump\u2019s plan would actually be quite substantial for middle class families. The following numbers come from a recent Charisma article \u2026 \\n\u2022 A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. \\n\u2022 A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill. \\n\u2022 Married couple earning $5 million per year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses will get only a 3% reduction in their tax bill. \\n#2 Donald Trump would lower taxes on businesses \\nUnder his plan, no business in America would be taxed more than 15 percent. Alternatively, Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan would tax some small businesses at a rate of close to 50 percent. So Trump\u2019s plan would undoubtedly be good for businesses, and it would encourage many that have left the country to return. \\nBut where would the lost tax revenue be made up? \\n#3 Childcare expenses would be exempt from taxation \\nFor working families with children this would be a great blessing. Without a doubt this is an effort to win over more working women, and this is a demographic that Trump has been struggling with. \\nIt is definitely an idea that I support, but once again where will the money come from to pay for this? \\n#4 U.S. manufacturers will be allowed to immediately fully expense new plants and equipment \\nThis would undoubtedly lead to a boom in capital investment, but it would also reduce tax revenue. As an emergency measure this would be very good for encouraging manufacturers to stay in America , but it would also likely increase the budget deficit. \\n#5 A temporary freeze on new regulations \\nRed tape is one of my big pet peeves, and so I greatly applaud Trump for this proposal. I think that Bob Eschliman put it very well when he wrote the following about Trump\u2019s planned freeze on new regulations\u2026 \\nIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Studies show that small manufacturers face more than three times the burden of the average U.S. business, and the hidden tax from ineffective regulations amounts to \u201cnearly $15,000 per U.S. household\u201d annually. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion dollars per year, and Trump will end it. \\n#6 All existing regulations would be reviewed and unnecessary regulations would be eliminated \\nIn particular, Trump\u2019s plan would focus on getting rid of regulations that inhibit hiring. The following are some of the specific areas that he identifies on his official campaign website \u2026 The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which forces investment in renewable energy at the expense of coal and natural gas, raising electricity rates; The EPA\u2019s Waters of the United States rule, which gives the EPA the ability to regulate the smallest streams on private land, limiting land use; and The Department of Interior\u2019s moratorium on coal mining permits, which put tens of thousands of coal miners out of work. \\n#7 Donald Trump would fundamentally alter our trade relationships with the rest of the globe \\nDonald Trump is the first major party nominee in decades to recognize that our trade deficit is absolutely killing our economy. I write about this all the time , and it is a hot button issue for me. So I definitely applaud Trump for proposing the following \u2026 Appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for America: narrowing our trade deficit, increasing domestic production, and getting a fair deal for our workers. Renegotiate NAFTA. Bring trade relief cases to the world trade organization. Label China a currency manipulator. Apply tariffs and duties to countries that cheat. Direct the Commerce Department to use all legal tools to respond to trade violations. \\n#8 Donald Trump\u2019s plan would be a tremendous boost for the U.S. energy industry \\nBarack Obama promised to kill the coal industry, and that is one of the few promises that he has actually kept. Obama also killed the Keystone Pipeline, and right now the energy industry as a whole is enduring their worst stretch since the last recession. To turn things around, Trump would do the following \u2026 Rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clinton\u2019s extremist agenda. Ask Trans Canada to renew its permit application for the Keystone Pipeline. Make land in the Outer Continental Shelf available to produce oil and natural gas. Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius) and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs. \\n#9 Trump would repeal Obamacare \\nTrump claims that Obamacare would cost our economy two million jobs over the next ten years. And without a doubt, it has already cost the U.S. economy a lot of jobs . \\nNot only that, but Obamacare has also sent health insurance premiums soaring, and this is putting a tremendous amount of financial pressure on many families. \\nTrump says that he would \u201creplace\u201d Obamacare, but that is a rather vague statement. \\nWhat exactly would he replace it with? \\n#10 Trump\u2019s plan says nothing about the Federal Reserve \\nThis is a great concern, because the Federal Reserve has far more power over the economy than anyone else does. It is at the very heart of our debt-based system, and unless something is done about the Fed our debt bubble will continue to get even larger. \\nSince the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen by more than 96 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger. For Trump to not even mention the Federal Reserve in his economic plan is a tremendous oversight. \\nWe are in the midst of a long-term economic decline, and things have not gotten better during the Obama years. If you can believe it, a study that was just released by Harvard even acknowledges this \u2026 \\nAmerica\u2019s economic performance peaked in the late 1990s, and erosion in crucial economic indicators such as the rate of economic growth, productivity growth, job growth, and investment began well before the Great Recession. \\nWorkforce participation, the proportion of Americans in the productive workforce, peaked in 1997. With fewer working-age men and women in the workforce, per-capita income for the U.S. is reduced. \\nMedian real household income has declined since 1999, with incomes stagnating across virtually all income levels. Despite a welcome jump in 2015, median household income remains below the peak attained in 1999, 17 years ago. Moreover, stagnating income and limited job prospects have disproportionately affected lower-income and lower-skilled Americans, leading inequality to rise. \\nThat same study found that the percentage of Americans participating in the labor force peaked back in 1997 and has been steadily declining since that time\u2026 \\nIf we continue to do the same things, we will continue to get the same results. \\nDonald Trump is promising change, and many of his proposals sound good, but there are also some areas to be concerned about. \\nUltimately, just tinkering with the tax code and reducing regulations is not going to be enough to turn the U.S. economy around. We need a fundamental overhaul of our economic and financial systems, and Trump\u2019s plan stops well short of that. But without a doubt what he is proposing is vastly superior to Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan, and so he should definitely be applauded for at least moving in the right direction. More Jobs Shipped Out Of The Country: Ford Moves All Small Car Production To Mexico \u00bb trump will have an \u201caccident\u201d \\nbut,but,but but ,but obammy mammy said \u201cDonald trump will never (ever) become president\u201d,his words ver batem.bawok also said \u201cDonald trump will never replace me in the WH\u201d,ominous ,disturbing words from el president,what exactly did baaaarak mean obamas red line 2.0 \\nObama did say trump will \u201cnever\u201d become president,not on his watch,for him that was a\u201d red line\u2019,but let\u2019s face it we all know barry\u2019s track record when it comes to red lines lol JC Teecher \\nIt will only happen the way the Obominable One says it will happen, \u201cIF\u201d, the Creator on the Throne, says it will. barry oldwater \\nHopefully his changes will spur economic growth which will bring in more revenue as more jobs are created, not saying it will, just speculating that this is his plan. SnodtBlossom \\nhe won\u2019t be elected anonymous \\nNobody is elected, they are selected. Elections are just a way to keep dumb-downed masses in check. So keep voting Lazarovic \\nYou\u2019re stupid, that\u2019s why you\u2019re anonymous. Coward too. anonymous \\nYou must be responding out of shameful ignorance. It\u2019s not your fault you are dumb-downed. It is ironic that you are calling me out for posting anonymously, when you are doing the same. Resorting to name calling though, really? LIZ THE SHIZ \\njust like in Ancient Rome election season is bread and circus , keep the masses entertained so they won\u2019t notice they\u2019re powerless and gullible BS1986 \\nShe\u2019ll use that in the debate. BS1986 \\nhe wants to be coronated , all hail Trumpus Maximus ThePeanut995 \\nYou are in for a rude awakening GSOB \\nWe all are, if either one is elected. I\u2019ve done my research. No choice is without risk. Trump is who I\u2019d like to see. It\u2019s time to think outside the box. \\nIf he gets in, perhaps in a 2nd term, the Fed Reserve get\u2019s axed. \\nI can\u2019t stop thinking big with Mr. Trump. I can\u2019t stop thinking small with the leftist. GSOB \\nWith more than 50% leftist population\u2026.it does look like the final nail. Alan Cecil \\nBwah ha ha ha\u2026another twist on the \u201ctrickle-down\u201d theory. It works great\u2026for the top 1%. hillery comin for your guns \\nthen there\u2019s hillery\u2019s economic \u201cplan\u201d, massive across the board tax increases,massive increases in the size of gov\u2019t,staggering draw droppin deficits,massive increases in entitlements (handouts),after all she did say she was continuing beewok obambi failed policies Mondobeyondo \\nI have never felt as depressed \u2013 about my own future, about the future of my friends, my family and my country- as I do at this very moment. William Lutz \\nMondo I\u2019m feeling the same way. Everyday the life is being sucked out of our wonderful nation with each passing day. I\u2019ve noticed it ever since the 2008 crisis, but even more so after Obama got reelected. The only thing we have to do now is hope for the best of our personal lives in the next few years. This downfall is inevitable. anonymous \\nYou\u2019re not the only one. Jerry C \\nMost of us felt that way almost 8 years ago. rat28 \\nAnother stupid tickle down economy by the GOP.. We should be taxing the rich . Obama regulation and energy policies protect us from global warming Obama health care help the poor and sick .. repealing Obamacare will hurt all the economy gains we seen the last 8 years.. Bad deal from Donald Trump. libs credit card economics \\nyeah just let the 35 year old \u201ckids\u201d livin in their parents basement worry bout the 12T of red ink,and that\u2019s just in 8 years GSOB \\nWhich is impossible to pay off. South Texas \\nThe stupid in your comment just burns. I\u2019ve not met one person who is retired who has benefited from the wonders of Obummacare. Their cost went way up for less choice and service. Maybe you could go get a medical degree and offer our services for free and help out with the problem. \\nAs for GW, another money sucking joke pushed by scum who live in opulate homes and waste more energy than any working class family. Speaking of which, how big is your home? SnodtBlossom \\nSleep with Trump in 2016! BS1986 \\nYou do have your moments. LIZ THE SHIZ \\noh Snotty, you just want to rub your fingers through his thick blond weave, don\u2019t you SnodtBlossom \\nWhat I\u2019m saying is.. If you vote for Trump and you\u2019re single and admit to voting for him,.. a lot of women won\u2019t want you. GSOB \\nLet me be blunt \u2013 God called women into spiritual leadership roles, as an exception to His design, in order to shame the men into bringing the nation back to God, and into exercising their God given responsibility to lead in the church, the home and in the nation. \\nIn no way does the Bible EVER paint women in leadership roles as a positive thing, but it is something God uses to shame the men into action. SnodtBlossom \\nBe SHAMED.. be very SHAMED G SOB LIZ THE SHIZ \\nand you wonder why your single LIZ THE SHIZ \\nbut they\u2019ll be the ugly women, not the mindless bleach blond Fox News types Satirist 1976 \\nMichael this is one of the best articles you have ever written. You presented Trump\u2019s solutions to issues that plague everyday Americans. Well done. This is not satire. \\nTrump should replace Ocare with the free market and nothing else. William Lutz \\nReplace Obamacare with individual Health Savings Accounts based on investments. Public hospitals with vouchers is also a great idea. South Texas \\nNo, the government needs to get out of looting me with a \u2018savings account\u2019 and make it free market all the way. GSOB \\nYou don\u2019t understand how it works. They don\u2019t tax those dollars you put into a HSA. Orange Jean \\nExcept that in most of them\u2026 you select a certain $$ amount each year\u2026 and if you don\u2019t use it, you lose it. Who do you think ends up with the money then? GSOB \\nDon\u2019t expect a reward for being careless. No system can sustain carelessness South Texas \\nExactly my point. Why do we have to put up with some over compensated elected person to \u2018let\u2019 me do something with my money? \\nI\u2019ve never had a use for an HSA but known people who do. But hey, at least the scum implicitly acknowledge they are cheating us by \u2018giving\u2019 us the privilege to use our money pre-tax. \\nIf some of us were not working almost 5 months of the year to support government and we had a real private health insurance and health care sector, this would be a non issue. SnodtBlossom \\nHillary will win Peanut \\nNO SHE WON\u2019T \u2026 HE IS NOW NECK AND NECK WITH HER AND WILL EXCEED HER\u2026 MORE STUFF ABOUT HER WILL BE COMING OUT! SnodtBlossom \\nHow much prior political experience does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! He talks the talk, but never walked the walk. But hey.. it\u2019s only THE PRESIDENCY! Maybe next we\u2019ll grab people off the street w/no medical training to do surgery! \\nNeither did Ulysses Grant or Dwight Eisenhower have a prior politcal position, though both had a strong military background. Dwight being \u201d The Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War II\u201d and Grant \u201cCommanding General of the United States Army\u201d How much military background does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! \\n\u201cno major U.S. company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trump\u2019s casino empire in the last 30 years.\u201d He has filed four business bankruptcies. Maybe he thinks it\u2019s just as easy to file bankruptcy w/the entire government and walk away. Raymond Chow \\nPolitical experience means nothing especially when someones political experience means the detriment of the nation. Cobbett \\n\u201dHow much prior political experience does Trump have\u201d \\nOh yes\u2026there\u2019s Iraq, Libya, Syria(she was also instrumental in convincing Bill to bomb Serbia\u2026.all resounding success stories\u2026politics just equal BS. turee60 \\nHow much military experience does Hillary and Obama have zilch none! jonodough \\nyou mean like the idiot obama? Mondobeyondo \\nIf she doesn\u2019t have a coughing epileptic seizure before the election. LIZ THE SHIZ \\nyup, the fix is in just watch the electoral college , your vote don\u2019t mean squat!!! GSOB \\nNot yet it don\u2019t Raymond Chow \\nWhy do people always mention electoral college when they don\u2019t understand what electoral college is? \\nWhen looking at the map of blue or red those are just projections where Democrats or Republican voted favorably in the past it doesn\u2019t mean electoral college. Electoral college delegates are pick by the winning candidate in the state. All states in the national election are winner take all. So if the candidate wins in majority of the district in the state he wins all the state electoral college. LIZ THE SHIZ \\njust like super delegates, seems fishy budman \\nnebraska is not winner take all. each congressional districts electoral vote depends on the vote within that district. GSOB \\nAnd the minimum wage will go up. And unemployment will rise, and government will spend even more. Orange Jean \\n\u2026 yeah, and little pink pigs will fly away from Smithfield Foods and not get turned into hams! ISA41:10 \\nYep! krinks \\nHey Genius. A Free Market solution led people to be denied coverage for nearly every malady under the guise of a pre existing condition. A Whistle Blower for/from the Health Insurance Industry admitted as much. The more she came up with creative reasons to deny payment/coverage the higher she was promoted. GSOB \\nThe free market is the best thing going! Because it has some level of risk, non hackers despise and envy this good system. What makes it good is that it benefits the majority of the people, not all. No system can. What happens if the majority are non hackers? Non hackers default to handout mode by finding fault with reality and cry, they depend on a leftist government to provide a silver spoon for everyone. The market then is no longer free. krinks \\nWeren\u2019t you paying attention? They take your premiums and then when you need to use it deny payment. GSOB \\nAppeal it then. krinks \\nAppeal? To who? The same person who gets a bigger bonus for telling you no? Are you an idiot? GSOB \\nYou sound like a confident young man. Just ignore me. Stick with your leftist ideas. Your choice. Jace Tate \\nthe once estudious michael snider is now drowned by drivel. LIZ THE SHIZ \\nwell he opened it up to a Trollathon Raymond Chow \\nWhen people runs out of argument or loses they start calling names which is exactly what you are. Yes, you sue or appeal your case. krinks \\nI explained that a big bonus follows when you tell people NO in the private industry. If you don\u2019t understand this YES you are an IDIOT. Jerry C \\nThen payers should be free to leave and go to a provider who says yes in a fair market. LIZ THE SHIZ \\nmeanwhile you die waiting for the appeal Raymond Chow \\nThen sue them or perhaps you didn\u2019t sign up for the coverage. It\u2019s like you got liability for your car insurance but you wanna be cover for medical when you get into an accident. joe \\nThat\u2019s how \u201cinsurance\u201d works. Simply banking in reverse and how the inventors, IE banksters intended. Raymond Chow \\nYes, a free market system where you can acquire health insurance across state boundaries. I.e., wish to buy health insurance in Iowa where it\u2019s lower even though I live in California. Cobbett \\nWhy are people so obsessed with their health? Why paying endless 10000s on the chance I \u201dmight\u201d get ill\u2026rather spend it on women and booze. Lillian DeVore \\nI think it\u2019s more of an obsession with the pre-existing conditions people\u2019s health. Cobbett \\nI had my appendix whipped out when I was 14(some time ago)\u2026even though I\u2019m a heavy boozer(although not now)\u2026I Feel Fine. Why worry\u2026what will be will be. GeneP54 \\nHe should, but he said that he wants universal healthcare. turee60 \\nI agree our medical the way it was was still the best in the world. People from Canada were coming here for medical cause it was so much better. The government doesn\u2019t need to get into our medical. Years ago like in 1986 I was out of work and had no medical and went to a free clinic in my area and got waited on quickly and it didn\u2019t cost me anything. William Lutz \\nI agree. On one hand, some of Trump\u2019s policies sound alright, but a lot of his proposals are dubious and a few are unrealistic. First of all, building a YUGE wall on the border is going to be very expensive and not very effective. Furthermore: \\n1) He never really mentions how he is going to deal with Planned Parenthood. 2) He obviously has no full intention of abolishing some bureaucratic agencies such as the Fed Reserve, the FDA, the USDA, Department of Energy, etc. 3) Reckless spending and debt is going to continue, and tax revenue will never keep up with the expenses. 4) I am not sure how he is going to replace Obamacare. 5) His idea on how to combat ISIS is not practical. It would mean extorting the Middle East out of their oil and having a costly militarist operation in various countries. It\u2019s a recipe for World War 3. 6) Even though he is anti establismhment at heart, he is running on a major party platform, which is rigged and corrupt. He should\u2019ve refused to participate within the Republican Party and join an alternative political party. Jace Tate \\nIsis took the oil didn\u2019t they William Lutz \\nYeah they probably took it, but my point is that you don\u2019t easily defeat ISIS by confiscating the oil and having a double version of the Iraq War. By the way, I forgot to mention that DJ Trump never spoke openly about civil liberties or mass surveillance either. Hence, I suspect that he will strengthen the so called \u201cwar on terror\u201d, which God forbid he would do. No more George Dubya Bush please. Christopher Privett \\nObama expanded Bush\u2019s programs of surveillance, and just paid Mexico 75 Million dollars. For a WALL built across their southern border. John Francis \\nYou are right, some things don\u2019t add up, but I\u2019ll take him over Hillary any day of the week. I\u2019m still struggling with whether to vote in the presidential at all, having a very hard time with Trump\u2019s torture advocacy and his call for the execution of Edward Snowden. Jessy Scholl \\nSeriously, Donald Trump can\u2019t talk about abolishing federal agencies because he would be killed on the spot. Jace Tate \\nhow are lower taxes going to help zero growth? How is income in the middle class going to aid the systems recovery? Once you go off the cliff of a set system in a fixed economy, you don\u2019t think there is any fixing it. I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer. However the way the apple is peeled can only be determined post collapse, after the decision makers have decided the direction the country takes. That is why even if you take out the true deplorables ruining everything, the best you can do is elect someone who identifies with the American way of life and our decisions. themacabre \\nHow are higher taxes for failed government programs going to help?\u2026we need to cut federal spending not give it more money. That\u2019s like giving a lazy bum watching tv and drinking beer another six pack. ISA41:10 \\n\u201d I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer. \u201d \\nHow stupid can you be?!?!? Explain to me how taking more money from the private sector (businesses and people) improves growth and the economy? \\nWaiting .. JC Teecher \\nYou are proof of how well mind control by the elite liberals is working. It is this mentality that is meant to destroy the God induced US Constitution. \\nWhen a nation has allowed four scotus to take the whole nation down a rat hole of sin, then the nation either digs back out or it gets drowned in darkness. \\nThere is a slim\u2026very slim chance that America can dig out of the rat hole for a few years, but ultimately sin will drown this nation into the abyss. \\nDon\u2019t believe it? It is in the book; the only book that matters. sister soldier \\nAmen and amen again. LIZ THE SHIZ \\nwe will wind up with a one world government just like in Star Trek Next Generation , the united federation of planets GSOB \\nLeftist 1. A member of an ideological camp that defines socialism as a form of totalitarian secular feudalism; an advocate for the management of non-Leftist people as farm animals. \\n\u201cWhen the Leftist tried to convince me that North Korea had the only true and just form of socialism on earth, I gave up on trying to talk rationally with him and just walked away.\u201d Jace Tate \\nif you would all stop patting each other on the back you\u2019d find the diversity among yourselves deplorable in the face of true knowledge. Jace Tate \\nyou changed your comment you liberal demagogues. William Lutz \\nBut I give Donald credit where it\u2019s due. At least he is better than Hillary and not as conniving and deceiving as she is. However, I refuse to pick the least of two bad apples. GSOB \\n.. vizeet \\nRemoving Obamacare and reducing Defense budget will be huge saving for US. And will be good for rest of the world\u2026. William Lutz \\nTrump however, will not reduce military spending and his idea of replacing ACA is only a secret plan. SnodtBlossom \\nDo you think he will help you when you are homeless? GSOB \\nIt is not the POTUS job to do that. LIZ THE SHIZ \\nif he has any rooms empty in his crappy hotels he can rent them to the homeless and get refunded through section 8 housing Raymond Chow \\nYou can\u2019t even afford to step into his hotel lobby.
