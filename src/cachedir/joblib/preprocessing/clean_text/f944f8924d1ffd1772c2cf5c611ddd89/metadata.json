She was seeking her first Olympic medal, and after four runs down an icy 1.  skeleton course, she was sure she had succeeded. She had not. She placed fourth, finishing   of a second behind Elena Nikitina of Russia, who took third. Two years later, after replaying the competition in her mind countless times, Ms. Uhlaender learned that Ms. Nikitina was among dozens of Russian athletes at the Sochi Games who were part of a   doping program, according to the longtime director of Russia\u2019s antidoping lab, Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cMy gut just got all wrenchy,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said recently, tears welling up as she slowed her pedaling on a stationary bike. \u201cIt\u2019s opening a wound. \u201d Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account of how doping controls were breached at the 2014 Olympics has tarnished the performance of dozens of Russian athletes and marred the integrity of the Games. His claims also have left many athletes who finished behind Russians feeling cheated. \u201cI\u2019ll never know what it feels like to stand on the podium in Sochi, but I want to put this behind me,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said. \u201cI want to know: Am I a bronze medalist?\u201d Ms. Nikitina\u2019s name appears on a spreadsheet provided to The New York Times by Dr. Rodchenkov. The document, which he said was sent to him by Russia\u2019s sports ministry two weeks before the Sochi Games, lists key competition dates for each athlete  \u2014   in Ms. Nikitina\u2019s case, Feb. 14, the date of her final two races, in which she had some of the fastest running starts at the Games. That list, Dr. Rodchenkov said, guided him in his nightly ritual in Sochi: surreptitiously swapping out the   urine of Russia\u2019s top athletes, at least 15 of whom won medals. An investigation into Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account is expected to conclude within days, three weeks before the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro are set to begin, and the full results of the investigation, due on Monday, could prove explosive. Dr. Rodchenkov has cooperated with the inquiry, which was commissioned in May by the World   Agency and has been conducted by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer who was part of a commission that last fall accused Russia of systematic doping. In a preliminary report last month, Mr. McLaren, who received the Sochi spreadsheet, called Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s story \u201cboth credible and verifiable. \u201d Last month, global sports officials barred Russian track and field athletes from the Rio Games. WADA has said that if the allegations prove true, it will consider recommending all Russian athletes be barred from competition Russia\u2019s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said he would resign if such a ban were imposed. In an interview in Moscow this week, Mr. Mutko denied that the government had been involved in any scheme, but expressed concern that his deputy was accused of giving Dr. Rodchenkov direct orders. Mr. Mutko was alternately confident in Russia\u2019s athletes and contrite about their attitudes toward   drugs. \u201cWe have to persuade people you can win without doping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the culture. It\u2019s a problem. \u201d Waiting for the Sochi inquiry to conclude, Ms. Uhlaender, who will turn 32 next week, has fought to keep her focus on the next Winter Olympics, in 2018 in South Korea. Still, she is concerned that sports officials will fail to deliver the rigorous and decisive result she craves. \u201cI\u2019m worried Sochi will be forgotten, and it scares me,\u201d she said. \u201cRodchenkov said he tampered with the samples, and there are rules against that. I just want to see them follow the rules. \u201d Ms. Uhlaender is training in the desert, spending her days lifting weights in Arizona with fellow professional athletes at a   gym and sprinting alongside dozens of other Olympians, mostly track and field athletes preparing for Rio. Between workouts, there is conversation of all kinds  \u2014   about   diets, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the price of gas  \u2014   but there is little mention of the allegations of widespread doping by the Russians. Ms. Uhlaender said she had talked about the situation twice with her coach. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d he asked her before moving on. \u201cThe worst thing I can do is talk about it,\u201d she said over a chicken lettuce wrap and four shots of espresso. When not training, she meditates works in education for a traumatic brain injury center, having recovered from a concussion herself watches Netflix and exchanges texts with two Navy SEAL friends who have helped keep her tough, she said. \u201cWhen I come to train, I don\u2019t want drama,\u201d she said, fiddling with a National League championship ring belonging to her father, the former baseball player Ted Uhlaender. The ring, which she tucks into the back of her sports bra as she works out, hangs on a silver chain alongside a tiny baseball charm that holds his ashes. One of the few people Ms. Uhlaender has talked to about the doping scandal in recent months is Ms. Nikitina, her Russian competitor. In May, days after Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account became public, Ms. Uhlaender and Ms. Nikitina exchanged more than a dozen messages on Facebook. Ms. Nikitina expressed shock at Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s statements. \u201cWe all think this is politics!\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe basically joke about it. \u201d She added: \u201cEach athlete sure of himself! As we say in Russia, \u2018Such complex situations make us stronger. \u2019\u201d Ms. Nikitina, who did not respond to messages from The Times, told Ms. Uhlaender her name was not on Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s spreadsheet, and she emphasized the sacrifices she had made to train twice a day to become a better athlete. When Ms. Uhlaender asked if Russian Olympians had doped at Sochi, Ms. Nikitina said that she could speak only for skeleton racers, and that the answer was no. Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s spreadsheet listed five Russian skeleton athletes, including Alexander Tretyakov, who won gold at the Games. Asked about the allegations this year, the Russian Bobsled and Skeleton Federation wrote in an email that all of its athletes \u201cunderwent doping control procedures in accordance to the rules,\u201d adding, \u201cAll of them were clean, and not one positive result was found. \u201d Mr. Mutko said in Moscow this week that Mr. Tretyakov and other accused athletes had long careers with clean histories. \u201cThese athletes didn\u2019t appear in sport all of a sudden,\u201d he said. \u201cNo whiskey would be enough to stop them,\u201d he said, referring to the mixture of steroids and liquor that Dr. Rodchenkov said he developed and distributed to coaches to help Russian athletes absorb drugs more quickly before traveling to international competitions for testing. Mr. Mutko said, however, that if Mr. McLaren\u2019s inquiry proved Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account true, the athletes in question would be disciplined. \u201cI am not on the list!\u201d Ms. Nikitina wrote to Ms. Uhlaender in a recent exchange. \u201cI hope that the truth will prevail! And the perpetrators of this scandal will be punished!\u201d Medalists like Ms. Nikitina received high praise for their performance at Sochi. After the Games, President Vladimir V. Putin presented Ms. Nikitina, a   Olympian, with a state award, the Order for Merit to the Fatherland. \u201cYour amazing debut,\u201d Mr. Putin said in a public statement to Ms. Nikitina at the time, \u201cmet the expectations of your fans, coaches and teammates. \u201d Regardless of what may come of the investigation, Ms. Uhlaender called herself more determined than ever to work toward the only major title she has yet to capture in her   career. \u201cI want to win Korea,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m first, I\u2019ll know no one ahead of me doped. \u201d She said she felt sympathy for Ms. Nikitina, whether or not the claims against her were substantiated. \u201cShe\u2019s going through something, too,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said. \u201cThe shininess has been dulled for both of us. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564367.5378954}
