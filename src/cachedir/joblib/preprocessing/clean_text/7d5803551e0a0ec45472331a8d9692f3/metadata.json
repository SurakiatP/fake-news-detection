A month into his presidency, Mr. Trump arrived at    his private club here, for a third weekend in a row this Presidents\u2019 Day weekend. For the locals, that\u2019s at least three days of clogged roads and strict security protocols that hurt local businesses and frustrate residents. Although economic development officials are ecstatic over the free publicity provided by news reporters\u2019 live waterfront shots  \u2014   and the excited buzz in the area is palpable  \u2014   others are exasperated over the drain on small businesses and the circuitous routes residents have to drive to avoid two miles of closed roads. Secret Service rules restricting private flights have grounded operations at  Palm Beach County Park Airport in Lantana, nine miles south of Mr. Trump\u2019s club, where most of the business is conducted on Saturday and Sunday. That means no parachute jumping, banner advertising, flight lessons or chopper trips. Business owners there are hoping that a president who campaigned on improving the economic prospects of the little guy will be sympathetic to the havoc his visits wreak. \u201cThis is a good test of his words versus his actions,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, whose company, Stellar Aviation Group, runs the airport. He said he had lost $30, 000 with each of the president\u2019s visits. Dave Johnson, the owner of Palm Beach Aircraft Services, which maintains and operates planes at Lantana, said he employs eight people full time and provides transportation for clients including doctors, lawyers and other professionals who travel throughout the country for work. But when Mr. Trump is in town, no private flights can take off within a   radius, and arriving flights have to first stop elsewhere for security clearance. \u201cWe never dreamed that he\u2019d be here every weekend  \u2014   that\u2019s the killer,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m getting customers that have been with me for years, and they\u2019re actually moving their aircraft to other airports so they can fly. \u201d The Palm Beach County airport director\u2019s office tallied the losses during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit Feb. 3 to 6 to   . A sightseeing business canceled 19 tours and turned away a dozen  . One flight school business had to scratch $14, 000 worth of flight lessons. One company is in negotiations to move its   fleet out of the county, which would mean a loss of a quarter of the airport\u2019s fuel sales, according to the office\u2019s analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s a very busy airport with a lot of   men trying to make a living,\u201d said Bruce Pelly, the airport director for Palm Beach County. \u201cYou got flight training, aeronautics, a propeller shop, paint shops, maintenance companies. You got all kinds of businesses going on down there. We are obviously trying whatever we can to get that airport functioning in some form or fashion. \u201d Mr. Pelly said he had \u201coffered everything we can think of\u201d to make the airport secure. The Secret Service\u2019s response so far: \u201cNo. \u201d The White House and the Federal Aviation Administration referred calls about the matter to the Secret Service. The Secret Service did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cIn their view, that airport is too close to  \u201d Mr. Pelly said of his conversations with the Secret Service. \u201cWe are not giving up. \u201d Jorge Gonzalez, who owns SkyWords Advertising, said he might have to. He said his business had lost $42, 000 because of Mr. Trump\u2019s visits, during which his   planes were grounded. He hopes to last through May, but his wife said that at this rate, 30 days was more likely. \u201cWe are hoping his visits slow to once a month,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. This isn\u2019t the first time a president\u2019s travels have caused local disruptions. President Barack Obama\u2019s visits to Hawaii were a source of frustration for pilots and aviation businesses there that had to abide by similar restrictions. And President Bill Clinton\u2019s frequent visits to White Plains during his presidency brought additional chaos to an already busy Westchester County Airport. Sascha Bennemann opened Costa Palm Beach, a Mediterranean restaurant at the Esplanade shopping complex at the east end of the county\u2019s toniest shopping district, Worth Avenue, just as Mr. Trump began his regular trips. On the second Saturday in February, when a   stretch of South Ocean Boulevard that runs in front of    was closed, cutting the town in two, 70 people did not show up for dinner, amounting to a loss of about $5, 000, Mr. Bennemann said. He showed a photo of himself golfing with Mr. Trump last year, to underscore: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal. \u201d Mr. Bennemann noted that increased foot traffic had offset some of his losses, and other Worth Avenue shop owners also said the visits had brought an increase in pedestrians. \u201cFor us, we have had some of the best days ever on weekends,\u201d said Tatiana Van Zandt, who owns Trillion, a luxury clothing store. \u201cThe hum is exciting. \u201d Kelly Smallridge, the president and chief executive of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, said her agency would never have been able to afford the countless hours of free publicity. \u201cCertainly this is the greatest advertising campaign in terms of name recognition an economic development board can hope for,\u201d Ms. Smallridge said. Although Palm Beach had already been viewed as a place to vacation or retire, Mr. Trump\u2019s visits have brought \u201cpanache and glamour,\u201d which have caught the attention of a wider spectrum of people, including hedge fund and money managers, she said. Laurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said, \u201cIf we want to be the Pollyanna of Palm Beach, all of the focus on the town is wonderful. \u201d Residents on that   stretch of closed road have to carry ID cards to get back to their homes, even when out walking their dogs.    Club members must park their cars at a parking lot down the street to be screened before they can enter through the club\u2019s south entrance. The road closing splits the island in half, forcing residents to drive off the island into neighboring West Palm Beach if they want to shop or eat on the other half. The road was closed again at 8 a. m. Friday and was expected to remain closed till late Monday evening. \u201cNo one is for road closures it\u2019s an inconvenience,\u201d said Kirk Blouin, the town\u2019s public safety director. \u201cBut most recognize it\u2019s a necessity for the security of the president. \u201d St. Catherine Greek Orthodox Church, in West Palm Beach at the western end of the Southern Boulevard Bridge, was holding its 42nd annual Greek Festival this weekend. \u201cIf they see the road closed, they will find something else to do,\u201d said the Rev. Andrew Maginas, who said the festival was a critical  . \u201cWe pray for him at every service to do right by our country, but we are sad that his visit comes during our festival. \u201cWe are hoping he can build a helipad soon on    grounds. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628317.37497}
