[A syllabus for Professor Wright\u2019s class, entitled \u201cClass, State, and Ideology: An Introduction to Social Science in the Marxist Tradition,\u201d was published only by the free   MacIver Institute.  The syllabus claims that the course covers the Marxist tradition and its \u201cradical critics of capitalism as an economic system and social order. \u201d Wright argues that a study of the Marxist tradition gives students the tools to understand the \u201cradical egalitarian project of social change. \u201d Wright, a tenured professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2019s Sociology Department, makes $116, 111 more than the average household income in Wisconsin. His $170, 000 annually salary also places him in the top two percent of all Americans. Wright has written extensively on \u201cradical democratic egalitarianism,\u201d and believes that the inequities by a capitalist economic and social order \u201cperpetuates eliminable forms of human suffering. \u201d It is unclear if Wright believes his membership in the top two percent of American income earners makes him a willing participant in the nation\u2019s capitalistic economic order that causes \u201chuman suffering. \u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
