Additionally, 32 individuals and five call centers in India were charged with connection to the case. \\nUS Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in a press briefing that Washington was looking forward extraditing the suspects from India to face jail terms. \\n\u201cIt's really important for the scammers in India to know that the United States is looking at this, is watching them and they could, if they engage in that activity, be extradited to the United Sates and could sit in jail ... for several years,\u201d she said. \\nIn a bill of indictment for the scammers, the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas had pointed to scare tactics employed by the operators of call centers in Ahmedabad, in the Indian state of Gujarat. \\nThey \u201cthreatened potential victims with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay taxes or penalties to the government,\u201d it read. \\nThe extent of the scam was so vast that major federal organizations such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Treasury, Homeland Security, US Secret Service and police had to help with the investigation, according to the Justice Department.
