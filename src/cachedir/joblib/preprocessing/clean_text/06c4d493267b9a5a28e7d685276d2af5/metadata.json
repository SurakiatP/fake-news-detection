S. embassy to Jerusalem, but a recent diplomatic spat showed why it has been so hard for him to do so. [On Monday, the Times of Israel reported that talks between U. S. and Israeli officials coordinating Trump\u2019s upcoming visit to the Western Wall  \u2014   the holiest site in Judaism  \u2014   stumbled when a \u201csenior American official\u201d said that the area was not within Israeli control and was part of the West Bank.  That is the official position of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, and of UN Security Council Resolution 2334, Obama\u2019s parting shot against the Jewish state. It is not clear who, exactly, the \u201csenior American official\u201d was, but Israel\u2019s Ha\u2019aretz identified the culpable parties as \u201cdiplomats stationed at the U. S. consulate in Jerusalem. \u201d The consulate is located in eastern Jerusalem and has long been regarded as more sympathetic to the Palestinians. (Update: The name of the official has since been reported as David Berns, a career bureaucrat at State.) The Trump administration disavowed that official\u2019s view. But generally, it is difficult to overstate the degree to which the career bureaucracy disapproves of moving the U. S. embassy  \u2014   and not just in the State Department. There are various reasons given, from possible prejudice to peace talks with the Palestinians, to repercussions in U. S. relations with Arab and Muslim countries. Still, it is difficult to distinguish the arguments against moving the embassy from the arguments against recognizing Israel in the first place. Already, the Trump administration has been grappling with the challenge of working with Obama administration holdovers in the bureaucracy who have not yet been replaced. Add to that the fact that there are members of the   \u201cdeep state\u201d who are actively undermining the president, through leaks and other methods, and you have a formidable obstacle to progress  \u2014   one to which Trump\u2019s predecessors yielded, and which Trump alone can defeat.
