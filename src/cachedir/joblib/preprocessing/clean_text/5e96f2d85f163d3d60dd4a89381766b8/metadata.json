United Airlines was besieged by an angry public after a gate agent refused to let two teenagers board a flight to Minneapolis at Denver International Airport on Sunday because they were wearing leggings. The outcry was swift and furious. The model Chrissy Teigen said she would fly topless the next time she flew United. The actor William Shatner snarked about pants he once wore on the set of \u201cStar Trek. \u201d Calls for boycotts of United flooded social media sites. United wouldn\u2019t back down, saying initially that the barring was justified because gate agents could ban anyone who was not \u201cproperly clothed. \u201d But this only fueled the bubbling controversy. Hours later, United issued a clarification, saying that the teenagers and their parents had been traveling with \u201cpass riders,\u201d tickets given to employees or their friends at a heavily discounted rate, and that with this comes the responsibility of a dress code. \u201cWhen taking advantage of this benefit, all employees and pass riders are considered representatives of United,\u201d read a statement that United posted late on Sunday evening. \u201cAnd like most companies, we have a dress code that we ask employees and pass riders to follow. The passengers this morning were United pass riders and not in compliance with our dress code for company benefit travel. \u201d These are tickets that are typically left over, usable when there are empty seats on a plane. The regular paying passengers are known in the business as \u201crevenue customers. \u201d While some details of this tale remain murky  \u2014   as of right now, the family remains anonymous  \u2014   dress codes for employees, their families and friends who are traveling on free or discounted passes have been in place for decades, although not all are strictly enforced. Both of Betty Horne\u2019s parents, for example, worked in the aviation industry, and both for United. Her mother was a flight attendant and her father a flight engineer. Ms. Horne, 60, said she had started taking discounted flights thanks to her parents in the 1950s, and even then took great pains in the way she dressed. \u201cAs a small kid, there wasn\u2019t that much of a problem because we were always in dresses,\u201d Ms. Horne said. \u201cThat was just not an option. We always dressed up. In the late \u201960s, early \u201970s, that was when I was really concerned with whether I was meeting standards or not. \u201d United explicitly bans \u201c    tops, pants and dresses,\u201d along with \u201cany attire that reveals a midriff,\u201d \u201cmini skirts,\u201d \u201cbare feet\u201d and many others. Delta is far less specific, saying only this in its guide: \u201cJust remember, Delta has a relaxed dress code for pass riders, but that doesn\u2019t mean a sloppy appearance is acceptable. You should never wear unclean, revealing or lewd garments, or swimwear or sleepwear on a flight. \u201d In a statement, Delta said, \u201cWe ask our employees and their family and friends flying on pass privileges to use their best judgment when deciding what to wear on a flight. \u201d American Airlines says in its employee travel guide, \u201cIn general, if attire is appropriate and in good taste for our revenue customers, then it is acceptable for us as well. \u201d It goes on to specify that travelers are not to wear \u201ctorn, dirty or frayed clothing,\u201d \u201cclothing that is distracting or offensive to others\u201d or \u201cclothing that is vulgar or violates community standards of decency. \u201d It is up typically to gate agents to decide what is appropriate and what is not for those traveling on pass riders. \u201cI have seen adults who have holes in jeans miss big international flights because the gate agent said, \u2018Nope, you don\u2019t meet our standards,\u2019 which I thought was brutal,\u201d said Mark Blacknell, 41, an attorney in Washington. Mr. Blacknell\u2019s mother works for Delta, and he has taken advantage of numerous pass riders. But there is a reason for the strictness of United\u2019s guidelines, a company spokesman said. They exist to take the decision out of the gate agent\u2019s hands. \u201cWe have guidelines like this to help our gate agents, because we don\u2019t want to put them in this position, to have to be making judgment calls about attire,\u201d said the spokesman, Jonathan Guerin. \u201cThat\u2019s what the policy is about. It\u2019s designed to help our employees do their jobs and be efficient and get people on board. \u201d What seemed to be lost in the social media fury was that commercial passengers are not held to the same standard, as Delta mentioned on Twitter, ribbing its competitor. But whether this controversy will bring about a change by United remains to be seen. \u201cWe regularly review our guidelines,\u201d Mr. Guerin said.'"}, "time": 1742561762.8461742}
