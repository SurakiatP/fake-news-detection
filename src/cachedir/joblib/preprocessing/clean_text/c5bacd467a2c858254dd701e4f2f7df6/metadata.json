However meandering his path, he was at the heart of radical history in the 60s, an erstwhile companion, if not always a comrade, on the route of every boomer lefty. \\nOne of his finer moments for me, which I\u2019ve never seen mentioned (including among this week\u2019s encomia) since he wrote it, was his 2006 article , published on CounterPunch with an introduction by Alexander Cockburn, in which he apologized for a \u201cdescent into moral ambiguity and realpolitick that still haunts me today.\u201d It would be respectful of Hayden\u2019s admirers and critics, on the occasion of his passing, to remember which of his actions \u201chaunted\u201d him the most. \\nThe title of the article says it clearly: \u201cI Was Israel\u2019s Dupe.\u201d In the essay, Hayden apologizes for his support of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which was for him that \u201cdescent into moral ambiguity\u201d More importantly, he explains why he did it, in a detailed narrative that everyone should read. \\nHayden sold out, as he tells it, because, in order to run as a Democratic candidate for the California State Assembly, he had get the approval of the influential Democratic congressman Howard Berman. Berman is a guy who, when he became Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was proud to tell the Forward that he took the job because of his \u201cinterest in the Jewish state\u201d and that: \u201cEven before I was a Democrat, I was a Zionist.\u201d \\nHayden had to meet with Howard\u2019s brother Michael, who, acting as \u201cthe gatekeeper protecting Los Angeles\u2019 Westside for Israel\u2019s political interests,\u201d told Hayden: \u201cI represent the Israeli Defense Forces\u201d\u2014a sentence that could serve as the motto of most American congress critters today. The \u201cBerman-Waxman machine,\u201d Hayden was told, would deign to \u201crent\u201d him the Assembly seat on the \u201cone condition: that I always be a \u2018good friend of Israel.\u2019\u201d \\nBut American congressmen were not the only \u201cgatekeepers\u201d through whose hands Hayden had to pass before being allowed to run for Congress. Other \u201ccertifiers\u201d included \u201cthe elites, beginning with rabbis and heads of the multiple mainstream Jewish organizations,\u2026 the American-Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC), \u2026[and].. Israeli ambassadors, counsels general and other officials.\u201c \\nIn fact, Hayden had to, in his words, be \u201cdeclared \u2018kosher\u2019 by the ultimate source, the region\u2019s representative of the state of Israel,\u201d Benjamin Navon, Israel\u2019s Counsul-general in Los Angeles. \\nIn other words, in this article Hayden was describing, in an unusually concrete way, how the state of Israel, through its state officials and their compliant American partners, was effectively managing\u2014exercising veto power over Democratic Party candidates, at the very least\u2014American elections down to the level of State Assembly . In any constituency \u201cattuned to the question of Israel, even in local and state elections,\u201d Hayden knew he \u201chad to be certified \u2018kosher,\u2019 not once but over and over again.\u201d \\nThis experience prompted Hayden to express a \u201cfear \u2026that the \u2018Israeli lobby\u2019 is working overtime to influence American public opinion on behalf of Israel\u2019s military effort to \u2018roll back the clock\u2019 and \u2018change the map\u2019 of the region.\u201d Hayden warned of the \u201ctrepidation and confusion among rank-and-file voters and activists, and the paralysis of politicians, especially Democrats,\u201d over support of Israel. He vowed to \u201cnot make the same mistake again,\u201d and said: \u201cMost important, Americans must not be timid in speaking up, as I was 25 years ago.\u201d \\nWhatever else he did\u2014and he was never particularly radical about Palestine\u2014this article was a genuinely honest and unusual intervention, and it deserves a lot more notice\u2014as a moment in Tom Hayden\u2019s history and that of the American left\u2014than it has got. Looking back and regretfully acknowledging that one had been duped and morally compromised by what seemed the least troublesome path 25 years earlier, saying \u201cI woulda, shoulda, coulda done the right thing,\u201d is a haunting moment for anyone. Doing it in a way that exposes in detail how a foreign country constantly manipulates American elections over decades is worthy of everyone\u2019s notice. \\nI doubt Hillary and her Democratic supporters will have anything to say about this \u201cinterference \u201cin American elections, even local and state. But I do hope many of those who are touched by the loss of Tom Hayden heed these words from him, and don\u2019t wait another 25 years to overcome their \u201cfear and confusion\u201d about saying and doing the right thing regarding the crimes of Israel, troublesome as that might be.'"}, "time": 1742564610.9375398}
