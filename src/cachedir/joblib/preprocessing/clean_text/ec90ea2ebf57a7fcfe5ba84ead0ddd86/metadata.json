The patronus charm, a cross between a spirit animal and a   charm, is one of the many bits of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d lore that fans continue to debate and celebrate nearly two decades after the first book was published. This has given J. K. Rowling, the boy wizard\u2019s creator, plenty of time to turn her wizarding world into a finely tuned marketing machine. On Thursday, that machine delivered what it called the \u201conly authentic Patronus experience,\u201d allowing visitors to Ms. Rowling\u2019s definitive fan site, Pottermore, to take a quiz and see what theirs would be. The test, produced with 3D animation and written by Ms. Rowling herself, quickly excited fans online, who used the social media incantation #ExpectoPatronum to share their results. Twitter erupted into a menagerie full of dolphins, polecats, aardvarks and Irish wolfhounds. Some very   fans played along. (There\u2019s no way of knowing how many possible patronuses are out in the wizarding world. This writer\u2019s patronus is a basset hound. The editor\u2019s is a Siberian cat. Ms. Rowling\u2019s is a heron.) Ms. Rowling and her employees at Pottermore hinted at this with some mysterious viral marketing. A day earlier, Potterheads were frantic over a mysterious tweet sent by Pottermore that showed a completely dark image, followed by images of a dark forest. But Potter obsessives are hard to fool: Most fans guessed what was happening right away.'"}, "time": 1742563104.8427002}
