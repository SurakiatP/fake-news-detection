[The official Twitter account for the Trevor   show posted a message Wednesday asking viewers to pick what they thought Thursday\u2019s biggest news headline would be.  The four hypothetical headlines were \u201cTrump uses Constitution as a KFC napkin,\u201d \u201cComey drops a complete \u2018visual album,\u2019\u201d \u201cIvanka requests immunity,\u201d and \u201cDonald Trump announces he is now Donna Trump. \u201d The last joke apparently set off social media, as users wasted no time in ripping the Daily Show for making light of transgender transitioning. Some users noted the joke was particularly offensive because it was made on International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia  Biphobia. Of course the Daily Show ran a lazy transphobic joke on the Intl Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia   the day Chelsea is free,  \u2014   Kevin Colbert (@kevinescent) May 18, 2017,  SNL used homophobia to \u201dmake fun\u201d of trump and the Daily Show used transphobia today to the same ends. There must be a better way.  \u2014   Broderick Greer (@BroderickGreer) May 18, 2017,  @TheDailyShow E: \u201dThe Daily Show celebrates International Day Against Transphobia with transphobic \u2019joke\u2019.\u201d  \u2014   sharia lawful good (@hooper_x) May 17, 2017,  Repeat after me: gender identity is not a punchline https:  .   \u2014   Kitson Smyth (@smyth_kitson) May 18, 2017,  @TheDailyShow Haha you\u2019re right daily show. Someone transitioning is definitely as crazy as the other things on this list,  \u2014   TB Corporate (@trillballins) May 18, 2017,  @TheDailyShow Literally the easiest target in the ENTIRE WORLD and you go for a trans joke?  \u2014   slugabed (@mymillshake) May 18, 2017,  @TheDailyShow It\u2019s using us as a punch line which directly contributes to a climate where other bigots think they can murder us without consequences.  \u2014   Christina DiEdoardo (@ChristinaSFLaw) May 18, 2017,  @TheDailyShow Do better Daily Show. Trans people are not punch lines. \ud83d\ude21  \u2014   Beth Y (@Beth_Y) May 18, 2017,  @TheDailyShow international day against transphobia, chelsea manning gets released from prison, hacks at the daily show drop a transphobic joke. good jorb,  \u2014   DPRK Weed Nuke (@PrototypeCube) May 18, 2017,  no one at the daily show has ever even acknowledged their history of transphobia, much less apologized,  \u2014   um jammer trans g (@joffeorama) May 18, 2017,  One Twitter user recalled former Daily Show host Jon Stewarts harsh joke toward transgender people. Speaking of the Daily Show and transphobia this from 2003 seems relevant. Also props to @Dennis_Kucinich pic. twitter.   \u2014   Adam H. Johnson (@adamjohnsonNYC) May 18, 2017,  The show\u2019s official Twitter account has since deleted the joke. Neither the show nor its host Trevor Noah offered an immediate comment to address the situation.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742561936.5473056}
