They were smart, experienced, competent. So what was the problem? \u201cThey\u2019re not asking enough questions,\u201d she said. This wouldn\u2019t have been a bad thing in the business world of a few years ago, where the rules for success were: Know your job, do your work, and if a problem arises, solve it and don\u2019t bother us with a lot of questions. But increasingly I\u2019m finding that business leaders want the people working around them to be more curious, more cognizant of what they don\u2019t know, and more inquisitive  \u2014   about everything, including \u201cWhy am I doing my job the way I do it?\u201d and \u201cHow might our company find new opportunities?\u201d I may be   of this trend because I think of myself as a \u201cquestionologist,\u201d having studied the art of questioning and written a book about it. But I also think there are real forces in business today that are causing people to value curiosity and inquiry more than in the past. Companies in many industries today must contend with rapid change and rising uncertainty. In such conditions, even a   company cannot rest on its expertise there is pressure to keep learning what\u2019s new and anticipating what\u2019s next. It\u2019s hard to do any of that without asking questions. Steve Quatrano, a member of the Right Question Institute, a nonprofit research group, explains that the act of formulating questions enables us \u201cto organize our thinking around what we don\u2019t know. \u201d This makes questioning a good skill to hone in dynamic times. Asking questions can help spark the innovative ideas that many companies hunger for these days. In the research for my book, I studied business breakthroughs  \u2014   including the invention of the Polaroid instant camera and the Nest thermostat and the genesis of   like Netflix, Square and Airbnb  \u2014   and found that in each case, some curious soul looked at a current problem and asked insightful questions about why that problem existed and how it might be tackled. The Polaroid story is my favorite: The inspiration for the instant camera sprang from a question asked in the   by the    daughter of its inventor, Edwin H. Land. She was impatient to see a photo her father had just snapped, and when he tried to explain that the film had to be processed first, she wondered aloud, \u201cWhy do we have to wait for the picture?\u201d One might assume that people can easily ask such questions, given that children do it so well. But research shows that   peaks at age 4 or 5 and then steadily drops off, as children pass through school (where answers are often more valued than questions) and mature into adults. By the time we\u2019re in the workplace, many of us have gotten out of the habit of asking fundamental questions about what\u2019s going on around us. And some people worry that asking questions at work reveals ignorance or may be seen as slowing things down. So how can companies encourage people to ask more questions? There are simple ways to train people to become more comfortable and proficient at it. For example, question formulation exercises can be used as a substitute for conventional brainstorming sessions. The idea is to put a problem or challenge in front of a group of people and instead of asking for ideas, instruct participants to generate as many relevant questions as they can. Kristi Schaffner, an executive at Microsoft, regularly conducts such exercises there and says they sharpen analytical skills. Getting employees to ask more questions is the easy part getting management to respond well to those questions can be harder. When leaders claim they want \u201ceveryone to ask more questions,\u201d I sometimes (in my bolder moments) ask: \u201cDo you really want that? And what will you do with those questions once people start asking them?\u201d For questioning to thrive in a company, management must find ways to reward the behavior  \u2014   if only by acknowledging the good questions that have been asked. For example, I visited one company that asked all employees to think of \u201cwhat if\u201d and \u201chow might we\u201d questions about the company\u2019s goals and plans. Management and employees together decided which of these mission questions were best, then displayed them on banners on the walls. Leaders can also encourage companywide questioning by being more curious and inquisitive themselves. This is not necessarily easy for senior executives, who are used to being the ones with the answers. I\u2019ve noticed during questioning exercises at some companies that top executives sit in the back of the room, laptops open, attending to other business they seem to think their employees are the only ones who need to learn. As they do this, these leaders are modeling precisely the kind of incurious behavior they\u2019re trying to change in others. They could set a better example by asking \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201cwhat if\u201d  \u2014   while asking others to do likewise. And as the questions proliferate, some good answers are likely to follow.'"}, "time": 1742562333.3414958}
