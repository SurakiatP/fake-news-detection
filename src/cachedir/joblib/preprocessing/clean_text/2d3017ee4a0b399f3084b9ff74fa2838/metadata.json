Trump\u2019s campaign moved on Sunday to squelch reports  \u2014   set off by the candidate himself  \u2014   that Gennifer Flowers, the woman whose claims of an affair with Bill Clinton imperiled his 1992 presidential campaign, would be Mr. Trump\u2019s guest on Monday at his first debate with Hillary Clinton. In television interviews on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, flatly denied that Ms. Flowers would attend the debate, at Hofstra University on Long Island. And Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said that in threatening on Saturday to invite Ms. Flowers, Mr. Trump had merely been making a point. \u201cHe wants to remind people that he\u2019s a great counterpuncher,\u201d Ms. Conway said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week. \u201d The specter of Ms. Flowers\u2019s attendance arose during a skirmish of psychological warfare between the two campaigns and their supporters in the   to Monday night\u2019s matchup. Mark Cuban, the voluble billionaire who owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and is supporting Mrs. Clinton, announced on Twitter on Thursday that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign had given him a   seat at the debate to watch her \u201coverwhelm\u201d Mr. Trump. For good measure, Mr. Cuban  \u2014   who once hosted a   reality television show called \u201cThe Benefactor,\u201d and more recently offered $10 million to the charity of Mr. Trump\u2019s choice if the Republican nominee would let Mr. Cuban interview him for four hours about his \u201cpolicies and their substance\u201d  \u2014   suggested the debate would become known as the \u201cHumbling at Hofstra. \u201d On Saturday, Mr. Trump responded even more provocatively. The   Mr. Trump, whose second marriage grew out of an affair during his first one, has repeatedly raised Mr. Clinton\u2019s infidelities as a character attack against Mrs. Clinton. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have a long history of calling attention to Mr. Clinton\u2019s scandals. Ms. Flowers herself lent credence to the idea: \u201cYes I will be there,\u201d she wrote in a text message to The New York Times on Saturday. She did not respond to   messages on Sunday. Each campaign receives tickets from the Commission on Presidential Debates to give to supporters at its discretion, and campaigns often engage in mind games when picking guests, as appeared to be the case with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s choice of Mr. Cuban. But inviting Ms. Flowers would be in a different category. In 1992, Mr. Clinton denied Ms. Flowers\u2019s claim of an affair, but years later, when asked in a deposition whether he had engaged in \u201csexual relations\u201d with Ms. Flowers, he admitted having done so one time, in 1977. Ms. Flowers, in recently broadcast interviews, has accused Mrs. Clinton of being an \u201cenabler\u201d and has said the scandal is a relevant issue in 2016. Inviting Ms. Flowers would be risky for Mr. Trump, because he faces a potentially   gender gap with women, who might be troubled by such an aggressive and personal move. On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, portrayed Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post about Ms. Flowers as yet another example of behavior unbecoming of someone seeking the presidency. \u201cYou saw his reaction, which is to do his favorite sport, which is to dive in the sewer and go for a swim,\u201d Mr. Podesta said. But on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mr. Pence, the Indiana governor, sought to put an end to the matter. \u201cGennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cDonald was using the tweet yesterday really to mock an effort by Hillary Clinton and her campaign to really distract attention from where the people  \u2014   the American people  \u2014   are going to be focused tomorrow night, which is on the issues. It\u2019s on the choice that we face. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628336.2356968}
