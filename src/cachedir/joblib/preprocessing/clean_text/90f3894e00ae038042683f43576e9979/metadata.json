On top of that, the city is battling through a lawsuit from homeless people claiming they were subjected to unlawful \u201csweeps.\u201d \\n\u201cSince the beginning of the summer it seems like there are more people on the streets and sidewalks,\u201d a local woman, Stephanie Mills, told KCNC. \u201cIt just seems to be getting worse and worse as the weeks go by.\u201d Read more Church faces daily $100 fine for housing homeless on its lot, battles with neighbors \\nIt has been half-a-year since Denver started its crackdown on numerous homeless campsites. Citing health concerns, city officials started clearing out camps that blocked public sidewalks. However, the order did not last long. \\nAccording to KCNC, the city receives complaints about homeless camps daily, but it cannot do anything to fix the problem. \\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get calls from people who have one homeless person and they want us to \u2018Beam them up, Scotty,\u2019\u201d Bennie Milliner, executive director of Denver\u2019s Road Home, told the news channel. \\nAccording to Milliner, Denver has enough shelters to accommodate its homeless population, but not everyone wants to go there. Instead, many are willing to remain on the street, especially downtown. \\nThose sleeping rough are not willing to give up easily. They have high hopes of winning a class-action lawsuit filed in August, challenging the city\u2019s so-called \u201chomeless sweeps.\u201d This month, the case made it to a federal court. \\n\u201cThese ongoing sweeps are conducted without notice or with inadequate notice and in a manner that prevents Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class from retrieving their property,\u201d the lawsuit reads, stating that the way the sweeps are conducted \u201cshock[s] the consciences.\u201d \\n\u201cIt is difficult to imagine what it must feel like to be already homeless and suffering, then be forced to watch as everything you own in the world is thrown into a dump truck while you are afforded no means to contest the seizure and destruction of your property,\u201d a defense team representing the homeless wrote.
