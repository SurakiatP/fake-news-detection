[King Salman will stay in Beijing for three days, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, and meet with Xi as well as Premier Li Keqiang and National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) Chairman Zhang Dejiang. \u201cChina attaches great importance to the friendship and cooperation with Saudi Arabia,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe stand ready to take King Salman\u2019s visit as an opportunity to take   Arabia comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level. \u201d  While King Salman\u2019s visit to Tokyo involved an honorific meeting with Emperor Akihito, the Chinese hope to use his presence to strengthen their foothold in the Middle East. Chinese state media outlets are heralding the visit as a chance for China to take over what was once considered America\u2019s market to exploit. Xinhua calls the visit an attempt to silence   voices around the world. \u201cAs some scapegoat globalization for their sluggish economy, others remain open and cooperative to explore business opportunities and reap   fruits,\u201d a Xinhua column on the visit reads, a clear reference to U. S. President Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to globalist forces. Xinhua credits China for having \u201chelped build 56 economic and trade cooperation zones in 20 countries along the routes with a combined investment surpassing 18. 5 billion U. S. dollars, generating nearly 1. 1 billion dollars in tax revenue and 180, 000 jobs in those countries. \u201d Saudi Arabia, the outlet concludes, is seeking to be a part of that development. The Global Times, often the more combative alternative to Xinhua, suggests Salman\u2019s presence in Beijing means he \u201cputs Beijing ahead of Washington in his diplomatic visits. \u201d \u201cThis reflects Riyadh\u2019s tendency to \u2018Look East,\u2019\u201d the Times suggests. \u201cThe country is willing to develop a friendly relationship with Beijing on the premise that its ties with Washington remain intact. Saudi Arabia wants China\u2019s support in regional and international affairs. \u201d The king\u2019s visit has some competition, however, as Saudi officials celebrate the deputy crown prince\u2019s visit with President Trump on Tuesday. The Gulf news organization   cites Saudi officials calling the Trump meeting \u201ca historic turning point\u201d for bilateral relations.   cites Bloomberg, which quotes a senior adviser to Mohammed bin Salman claiming the meeting \u201cput things on the right track, and marked a significant shift in relations, across all political, military, security and economic fields. \u201d Among the most prominent points of agreement is the mutual distrust of Iran, newly emboldened by the Obama administration\u2019s concessions package to Tehran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) or the Iran nuclear deal. Trump had already discussed other Middle East hotspots, including Yemen and Syria, with King Salman in a phone conversation. Unlike relations with the White House, regional rival Iran is not a subject that Saudi Arabia and China appear to agree on. China has historically supported Russia in the UN Security Council, which has developed a particularly strong alliance with Iran in Syria. Neither China nor Saudi Arabia have entered the fray in Syria, though both have expressed concerns that the    civil war appears nowhere near its conclusion. China will also have to overcome Saudi distrust as it ramps up an internal war on Islam. While Chinese Communist Party officials have been permissive of Islamic practices, particularly among its Hui minority, it has taken the opposite position in western Xinjiang, home to the nation\u2019s Turkic Uighur minority. Uighurs are a   people in their region, the Communist Party has banned Islamic garb on public transportation, forced shops to sell   items like alcohol and cigarettes, and banned children from religious observance. This attitude appears to be trickling east into   regions. This week, the Communist Party secretary in Ningxia province, Li Jianguo, warned that the Islamic State was attempting to recruit Chinese people to engage in \u201cjihad, terror, violence,\u201d urging more vigilance over Muslim populations. The result of the government\u2019s warnings over Islam has been a growing popular distaste for the religion, according to a social media overview by the South China Morning Post. Such a policy is anathema to the Saudi government, which sees itself as the preeminent defender of Islam globally. \u201cWe confirm that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands with all its might behind the Islamic causes in general and we are fully ready for assistance and cooperation with your sisterly country as regards any effort or movement that serves Muslims\u2019 issues,\u201d King Salman asserted in Malaysia last month.'"}, "time": 1742562971.3749986}
