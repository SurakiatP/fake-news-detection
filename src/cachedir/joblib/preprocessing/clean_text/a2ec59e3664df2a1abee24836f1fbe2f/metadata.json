The fact that Melania is communicating with the media and the public in Saudi Arabia  \u2014   mainly through what Saudi news reports have deemed her \u201cclassy and conservative\u201d fashion choices  \u2014   works well in the notoriously   kingdom. Her intense appeal makes sense, considering the first lady represents so much that Saudi citizens find familiar and can relate to, especially visually.
