[After making a name for himself as an   grandfatherly figure with an emphasis on mercy over doctrine, Pope Francis has undertaken a series of ostensibly harsh measures that have left many observers scratching their heads in perplexity.  The posters that adorned the city of Rome Saturday bore an image of the pontiff along with a list of his alleged recent misuses of papal power, including ignoring cardinals, removing priests and \u201cbeheading\u201d two Catholic organizations. The posters follow a   tradition of Romans\u2019 public, albeit anonymous, criticism of the Pope when he is seen to overstep his mandate. In past times, discontent Romans would attach their written complaints to an ancient, dilapidated statue called \u201cil Pasquino\u201d near Piazza Navona. The text of the poster was written in \u201cRomanaccio,\u201d a rough dialect of street Italian spoken around the nation\u2019s capital city. In translation, the full text reads, \u201cHey Frankie, you have emasculated Congregations, suspended priests, decapitated the Order of Malta and the Franciscans of the Immaculate, ignored Cardinals  \u2026     Where is your mercy?\u201d Having placed great stress on mercy since the beginning of his pontificate, Francis has found himself particularly susceptible to the criticism of a certain   since he has reserved his most strident invectives for conservatives, labelling them rigid, doctrinaire and legalistic. In recent times, he has increasingly passed from words to actions, including notoriously twice demoting conservative Cardinal Raymond Burke \u2014  the former head of the Church\u2019s highest court \u2014  and firing Vatican clerics who allegedly criticized the Pope in private. The series of moves have led some critics to speak of an \u201cideological purge\u201d being carried out by Pope Francis. In a recent article, veteran Catholic reporter Philip Lawler offered a partial list of the pontiff\u2019s supposedly autocratic actions of the sort criticized by the Roman posters. Among the measures were the Pope\u2019s \u201cwholesale replacement of the prelates on the Congregation for Divine Worship,\u201d substituting more conservative clerics with a panel that will be \u201cmore friendly to the preferences of Pope Francis, and less supportive of the   prefect, Cardinal Robert Sarah. \u201d Lawler also mentions the \u201cabrupt dismissal of three clerics on the staff of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,\u201d for which no explanation was given. According to reports, the Pope made a point of saying that he did not have to give an explanation for the sacking. In point of fact, the priests had been accused of making \u201cunflattering comments about Pope Francis\u201d in private conversations, leading to speculation of how Francis got wind of the remarks. Then there was the \u201ccontemptuous treatment\u201d of the four cardinals who submitted questions (dubia) about a recent papal letter called Amoris Laetitia, which left many wondering how the Pope\u2019s ambiguous teaching on Holy Communion for divorced and remarried Catholics squared with the traditional doctrine of the Church. Unlike his immediate predecessors, Pope Francis has also reserved important promotions to   bishops, stacking the College of Cardinals with progressive newcomers while snubbing more senior prelates whose approach does not match his own. Criticizing the Pope apparently has an upside. While Roman public services are noteworthy for their inability to remove ubiquitous graffiti throughout the city, they were somehow able to remove all the posters criticizing the Pope before nightfall Saturday.
