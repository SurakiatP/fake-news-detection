Others have been told to shoot dots, and more still have been tasked with bringing down alien space fleets. These are hardly the tasks traditionally demanded of teenage soccer prodigies, but then PSV, the Dutch club, does not think of itself as traditional. Most clubs, after all, are concerned only with developing players with nimble feet. PSV, increasingly, is concentrating on nurturing agile minds. That is why in recent years every player at the club, from the youth system to the reserve squad, has been assessed on at least one of four customized computer programs. Though the programs bear an uncanny similarity to   video games  \u2014   balloons, space invaders and the rest  \u2014   Jurrit Sanders, one of PSV\u2019s sports scientists, rejects the term. \u201cThey are not games,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are tests. \u201d Remarkably predictive ones, judging by the evidence that Sanders and his colleagues have encountered. The tests are designed to assess a player\u2019s cognitive capacity, establishing and monitoring his abilities in 16 disciplines, including reaction time, how quickly he makes decisions and how intensely, and for how long, he is able to focus. \u201cWe have found that if a player comes in low on the tests, then they tend to leave the club at a low level,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIf they come in high, they tend to leave on a high level. \u201d The program remains at an early stage Sanders does not contend that the results are conclusive. PSV is sufficiently intrigued, though, to dedicate more time to researching cognitive training. \u201cWe know a lot about tactical training, technical training, physical training,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe do not know a lot about this. \u201d Finding a way to sharpen the mind, he said, could be coaching\u2019s next frontier. As The New York Times reported this year, there remains a considerable degree of skepticism among scientists and researchers about the benefits of cognitive training. Teams and individuals across a variety of sports continue to invest substantial sums  \u2014   and even more faith  \u2014   in systems claiming to hone the mind. Matt Ryan, the quarterback who led the Atlanta Falcons to the Super Bowl, is a devotee of NeuroTracker, a program also in use at Manchester United. Some experts retain the suspicion, however, that they are being sold a myth, that for all the advanced graphics and bold claims, computer programs designed to improve mental performance are, at best, a harmless placebo and, at worst, an expensive delusion. Luc van Agt, a physiologist at PSV, acknowledges those doubts. \u201cWe are just at the beginning,\u201d he said. That was part of the reason the club agreed to take part in a study conducted last year at PSV and another Dutch club, AZ Alkmaar, by researchers from the University of Amsterdam. Led by Geert Savelsbergh  \u2014   an academic known in the Netherlands as \u201cthe football professor,\u201d van Agt said  \u2014   the team exposed a control group of players to a video analysis exercise, in which they had to identify certain movements, such as passes and runs. Another group conducted sessions on IntelliGym, an Israeli cognitive training system based on technology designed in a very different context. \u201cIt was developed initially to help make fighter pilots smarter,\u201d said Danny Dankner, IntelliGym\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut something clicked with me that this platform could be used to address a lot of different things. It turns out that there are a lot of similarities in the skill sets needed by footballers and pilots. \u201d IntelliGym\u2019s interface is based on what Dankner called a \u201cspace battle metaphor,\u201d which ice hockey teams have used for several years. It was adapted to make it more relevant to soccer, seen as an underexplored market, with the help of PSV coaches and former players  \u2014   Phillip Cocu, Mark van Bommel, Ruud van Nistelrooy  \u2014   with respected   pedigrees. \u201cIntelliGym spoke to them,\u201d van Agt said, \u201cto find out what the program needed to do. \u201d The result is a system that would not look out of place in a   arcade. Players are asked to take control of one fleet of spaceships and take on another. The situation, though, changes continually. \u201cOne fleet can become invisible, or clouds might come and hide certain ships, or the player might be asked to take control of the other side,\u201d Dankner said. Each twist is designed to flex another mental muscle. \u201cIt examines things like anticipation, the ability to divide your attention, your working memory, your spatial perception,\u201d he said. The results of the University of Amsterdam study were clear. Both groups  \u2014   initially comprising 52 players  \u2014   were asked to perform their tasks twice a week over 10 weeks. Each time, they were then assessed in brief,   games outside on the training field. The researchers found that the skills of the players who had used IntelliGym improved by 30 percent more than those in the control group, according to Dr. Savelsbergh. Sanders is quick to point out that the study was hardly conclusive. But PSV is already conducting a \u201cPhase 2 pilot,\u201d in van Agt\u2019s careful phrase, to see what else can be gleaned from the cognitive training. At AZ Alkmaar, the other club involved in the study, the reaction has been  \u2014   if anything  \u2014   even more enthusiastic. \u201cWe think of ourselves as the Apple of the football industry,\u201d said Marijn Beuker, the head of performance and development at AZ. \u201cWe are always ready to think about new ways of doing things. \u201cWe are not a club that can buy the best talents, so we have to develop our own,\u201d Beuker continued, \u201cand to do that we try to look for every aspect of an athlete that can be improved. \u201d That culture of thinking differently has won AZ plenty of admirers. In February, Beuker visited with Bayer Leverkusen, in Germany, on a   expedition. Real Madrid is among the teams to have met with AZ to learn more about the club\u2019s work, which AZ shares freely. \u201cWe do not worry that they will catch us up,\u201d Beuker said, \u201cbecause we believe that in the time it takes them to implement everything, we will have moved on again. \u201d That may explain his willingness to brush aside doubts about cognitive training: He makes the point that if the improvement is genuine, the cause is irrelevant. AZ has already incorporated IntelliGym into the training regimen of its   through   teams. \u201cIf we think it is something that works,\u201d he said, \u201cthen it works. \u201d The next challenge, according to Sander Roege, PSV\u2019s mental performance coach, is whether anyone can find a way to train cognitive functions with physical exercises. Whatever the doubts, the clubs see the possibilities that cognitive training could open up. The German Football Association has plans to incorporate an IntelliGym suite at its new training center in Frankfurt Oliver Bierhoff, its technical director, is an ardent convert to the idea that sharpening the mind is as important as honing the feet. This, they all believe, is the next frontier. It remains a distant one, but one that ultimately could revolutionize understanding of the sport. At PSV, Roege said there may come a point when it would be possible to determine precisely what sort of cognitive strengths players in specific positions might require. \u201cWe are getting closer to finding out what capacities are needed to play on a good level,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you will get an ideal profile of what is needed to be a top player. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562136.515612}
