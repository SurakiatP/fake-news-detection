The uproar comes as Hillary Clinton is struggling to turn her and the party\u2019s attention to the fall. Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters showed no sign of backing down on Tuesday. In interviews, several threatened to disrupt the party\u2019s convention in Philadelphia in July with protests and nonviolent disobedience over a nominating system that they say has treated Mr. Sanders unfairly. In emails, on social media and on websites, his supporters have traded advice about protest tactics and legal services in case of mass arrests. Alarmed by the unrest in Nevada, Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, said that he spoke with Mr. Sanders on Tuesday and that the Vermont senator faced a \u201ctest of leadership\u201d over his supporters\u2019 actions. Mr. Reid, who represents Nevada, said he was confident that Mr. Sanders would \u201cdo the right thing. \u201d But Mr. Sanders showed no sign of backing down, releasing a statement that, while condemning violence, accused the Democratic leadership in Nevada of using \u201cits power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place. \u201d The fight in Nevada underscored the determination of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters to undermine Mrs. Clinton\u2019s    march to the nomination. On Tuesday she lost the Oregon primary but declared victory in Kentucky, where she held a   edge according to complete but unofficial returns. Mrs. Clinton spent Monday campaigning in Kentucky, showing how the battle against Mr. Sanders continues to distract her campaign even as she turns her fire on Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. And leading Democrats have become increasingly vocal about the need to unify the party for the general election  \u2014   while being careful not to anger Mr. Sanders by urging him to quit the race. Senator Barbara Boxer of California said she had reached out to Mr. Sanders about the need for unity. \u201cI have placed a couple of calls to Bernie,\u201d Ms. Boxer said. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend. He\u2019s been my friend for many, many, many years, and I haven\u2019t heard back from Bernie, and I would hope that Bernie will be a leader and make sure that everybody understands what is at stake. And what is at stake is the future of our nation. Nothing less. \u201d Ms. Boxer, who was in Nevada for the convention on Saturday as Sanders supporters erupted in anger, called what she witnessed \u201dterrible. \u201d \u201cWe just can\u2019t have a repeat of that in Philadelphia because it\u2019s distressing,\u201d Ms. Boxer said. \u201cI have a message to the Bernie people who are planning to be disobedient because the system is rigged. Here is the thing: They should support the Democratic candidate who got the most votes. They should support the Democratic candidate who got the most delegates. There is nothing to protest. \u201d But Sanders supporters remained defiant, raising the possibility of unrest on the streets outside the convention. \u201cYou are going to see a variety of tactics,\u201d said Elizabeth Arnold, 32, a former staff member for the Sanders campaign in Philadelphia who said she planned to demonstrate. \u201cI personally don\u2019t like being arrested. But it\u2019s essential that we speak our minds and assert our First Amendment rights. Our system is terribly flawed and terribly unjust  \u2014   so very just actions often end in arrests. \u201d Ms. Arnold, who helped found EDGE, an environmental justice group based in Philadelphia, said she did not condone violence and hoped that people would find a way to voice concerns peacefully. But she said that Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic leaders attending the convention \u201cshould worry about what is going to happen. \u201d Nina Turner, a prominent surrogate for Mr. Sanders, said that she had seen several emails from people planning acts of civil disobedience, and that talk of dissent in the Republican ranks over Mr. Trump masked the searing divisions among Democrats. \u201cPeople are talking about the Republicans having a brokered convention. I think we are sleeping on the Democrats,\u201d Ms. Turner said. \u201cAnd if Democrats believe that that\u2019s not going to happen, they are just sadly mistaken. They have blinders on. \u201d \u201cIt is going to be progressives who will disrupt,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when I say disrupt, I don\u2019t mean in a violent or a terrible way, but I just mean upset the apple cart. \u201d April Mellody, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Convention, said in a statement that the convention\u2019s security team would work with the Philadelphia police and the Secret Service \u201cto ensure the safety and security of all of our delegates and participants. \u201d After the meeting of Nevada Democrats on Saturday ended in mayhem when many potential Sanders delegates were deemed ineligible, Roberta Lange, the state party chairwoman, said she had received death threats against her and her family after Sanders supporters spread her cellphone number online. \u201cThe Sanders campaign helped incite everything that happened,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of attacking me, they should be publicly apologizing to me for the part that they played. I\u2019m really disappointed. It makes me feel like it is not being taken seriously. \u201d On Tuesday, the Nevada State Democratic Party issued a formal complaint to the Democratic National Committee in response to the behavior of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the national party chairwoman, also expressed her concern Tuesday. \u201cWe will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing and taking steps to prevent the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas,\u201d she said. But the protest effort enjoys some institutional support. RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, a union that has endorsed Mr. Sanders and that has been busing its members across the country to campaign for him, also said her group planned to take part in demonstrations at the convention. \u201cWe will be a significant force inside and a significant force outside,\u201d she said. \u201cThe focus is going to be how disenfranchised the voters felt during this election by the D. N. C. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628325.2032468}
