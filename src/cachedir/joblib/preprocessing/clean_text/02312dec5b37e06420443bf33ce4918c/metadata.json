Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nCNN has obtained brand new audio of North Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr joking about gun owners putting a \u201cbullseye\u201d on Hillary Clinton. \\nThe despicable comments come as Burr faces a close Senate race against Democratic opponent Deborah Ross. Both candidates are within a point of each other, according to RealClearPolitics. \\nMore of the CNN report : \\nThe North Carolina Republican, locked in a tight race for reelection, quipped that as he walked into a gun shop \u201cnothing made me feel better\u201d than seeing a magazine about rifles \u201cwith a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.\u201d \\n\u201cI was a little bit shocked at that \u2014 it didn\u2019t have a bullseye on it,\u201d he said Saturday to GOP volunteers, prompting laughter from the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. \u201cBut on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there\u2019s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.\u201d \\nThis type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to Republican leaders in 2016. As the campaign has gone on, the hateful and violent rhetoric, particularly from the man at the top of the Republican ticket, has become increasingly worse. \\nAt one point this year, Donald Trump suggested that \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d should take up arms against Clinton if she nominates a Supreme Court justices they don\u2019t like. He also said that he\u2019d like to \u201csee what happens\u201d if the Democratic nominee\u2019s bodyguards were disarmed. \\nAs CNN notes, Trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language \u2013 or anything he\u2019s ever said or done \u2013 but Burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed, although it does not excuse what he said. \\n\u201cThe comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,\u201d the Republican senator said, according to CNN. \\nThis type of imagery has no place in our politics, regardless of whether it\u2019s being said in public or private, especially given the heightened level of anger and hatred toward Hillary Clinton from Trump supporters. \\nWhether it\u2019s Trump or Burr, voters should remember their irresponsible language when they go to vote in just one week.'"}, "time": 1742563774.2002616}
