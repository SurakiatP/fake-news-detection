[The New York Yankees,   JetBlue, and ATT all pulled out of the June 11 parade this week in the wake of the parade committee\u2019s decision to award L\u00f3pez Rivera, an activist who enabled acts of terrorism in the name of Puerto Rican independence, the title of \u201cnational freedom hero. \u201d Goya pulled out of the parade last week, yanking $200, 000 of patronage, according to local lawmakers.  In addition to sponsors, representatives of the city\u2019s fire and police departments have also rescinded their support. The New York Police Department confirmed to Breitbart News that Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill will not attend the event over the decision to honor L\u00f3pez Rivera, while the NYPD and FDNY\u2019s Hispanic societies have both withdrawn from the parade. The union representing New York\u2019s firefighters also withdrew its support. The controversy centers around L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s role as a key member of the radical Marxist Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) which conducted more than 100 bombings in the United States in the seventies and eighties, killing five people, injuring dozens, and causing millions of dollars worth of damage. L\u00f3pez Rivera was convicted on charges of transporting guns and bombs and was released this month after serving 35 years. Obama commuted his sentence in January. When he was released, L\u00f3pez Rivera denied being a terrorist and thanked the governments of Venezuela and Cuba for their support, while reiterating the right for \u201ccolonized people\u201d to use force. \u201cLet me say this: We are a colonized people, and according to international law, that says all colonized people have a right to struggle for its independence using all methods within reach, including force,\u201d L\u00f3pez Rivera said, according to the New York Times. \u201cThat is a right. \u201d In a statement this month, the parade organizers stood by their decision to honor L\u00f3pez Rivera, whom they conceded was \u201ca controversial figure\u201d who does not represent all Puerto Ricans. \u201cSome people call him a terrorist while others think of him as a freedom fighter, as was the case with Nelson Mandela,\u201d the statement said.  The organizers said the intention was to honor those who worked to have his sentence commuted and to raise \u201cawareness about Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s story, the grave colonial situation in Puerto Rico and the identity questions that continue to arise, even today. \u201d \u201cNevertheless, Oscar\u2019s participation is not an endorsement of the history that led to his arrest, nor any form of violence. But rather a recognition of a man and a nation\u2019s struggle for sovereignty,\u201d the statement said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says he still intends to march in the parade. \u201cThe parade committee made a choice this year on someone to honor,\u201d de Blasio said, according to the Times. \u201cThat does not change the basic nature of the parade. Whether you agree with that choice or not, it\u2019s still the Puerto Rican parade and my point is, I will be there to honor the Puerto Rican people. I intend on marching. It\u2019s as simple as that. \u201d Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York. Follow Adam on Twitter: @AdamShawNY.'"}, "time": 1742561780.969532}
