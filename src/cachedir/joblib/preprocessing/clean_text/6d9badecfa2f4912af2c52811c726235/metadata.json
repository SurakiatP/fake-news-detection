Duehren et al., Harvard Crimson, November 3, 2016 \\nHarvard has cancelled the men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s season after an Office of General Counsel review found that the team continued to produce vulgar and explicit documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance. \\nAthletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to Harvard student athletes that he decided to cancel the rest of the team\u2019s season because the \u201cpractice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016.\u201d \\n\u201cAs a direct result of what Harvard Athletics has learned, we have decided to cancel the remainder of the 2016 men\u2019s soccer season,\u201d Scalise wrote. \u201cThe team will forfeit its remaining games and will decline any opportunity to achieve an Ivy League championship or to participate in the NCAA Tournament this year.\u201d \\nLast week, The Crimson reported that the 2012 men\u2019s soccer team created a \u201cscouting report\u201d of that year\u2019s women\u2019s soccer recruits, rating them numerically and assigning each a hypothetical sexual position. University President Drew G. Faust instructed OGC, Harvard\u2019s team of lawyers, to \u201creview\u201d the matter. \\n{snip} \\n\u201cThe decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard\u2019s view that both the team\u2019s behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community,\u201d Faust wrote in a statement. \\nFaust wrote she \u201cwas deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the 2012 men\u2019s soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nLast week, when Scalise first saw the documents\u2014which were, until recently, publicly accessible through the 2012 team\u2019s Google Group\u2014he said he would immediately reach out to coaches of both men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams to discuss the report, but added that any response should be internal to Harvard and \u201cnot a media thing.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nMen\u2019s soccer coach Pieter S. Lehrer wrote in a statement that the team is \u201cbeyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration.\u201d \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742562150.7707658}
