{"duration": 0.35773682594299316, "input_args": {"text": "'When it was created more than a half century ago, Medicaid almost escaped notice.   stories hailed the bigger, more controversial part of the law that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed that July day in 1965  \u2014   health insurance for elderly people, or Medicare, which the American Medical Association had bitterly denounced as socialized medicine. The New York Times did not even mention Medicaid, conceived as a small program to cover poor people\u2019s medical bills. But over the past five decades, Medicaid has surpassed Medicare in the number of Americans it covers. It has grown gradually into a behemoth that provides for the medical needs of one in five Americans  \u2014   74 million people  \u2014   starting for many in the womb, and for others, ending only when they go to their graves. Medicaid, so central to the country\u2019s health care system, also played a major, though far less appreciated, role in last week\u2019s collapse of the Republican drive to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. While President Trump and others largely blamed the conservative Freedom Caucus for that failure, the objections of moderate Republicans to the deep cuts in Medicaid also helped doom the Republican bill. \u201cI was not willing to gamble with the care of my constituents with this huge unknown,\u201d said Representative Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey, a member of the centrist Tuesday Group caucus, noting that in three of the counties in his district in the state\u2019s more conservative southern half, over 30 percent of all residents are covered by Medicaid. In the Senate, many Republicans, echoing their states\u2019 governors, had worried about jeopardizing the treatment of people addicted to opioids, depriving the working poor, children and people with disabilities of health care and in the long run reducing funding for the care of elderly people in nursing homes. The Republican bill would have largely undone the expansion of Medicaid under the A. C. A. which added 11 million   adults to the program and guaranteed the federal government would cover almost all of their costs. It would have also ended the federal government\u2019s   commitment to pay a significant share of states\u2019 Medicaid costs, no matter how much enrollment or spending rose. Instead, the bill would have given the states a choice between a fixed annual sum per recipient or a block grant, both of which would have almost certainly led to major cuts in coverage over time. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that the Republican bill would have cumulatively cut projected spending on Medicaid by $839 billion and reduced the number of Medicaid beneficiaries by 14 million over the coming decade. Many Republicans could not stomach those consequences. Even some conservatives  \u2014   Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey, for example, and Daniel Webster of Florida  \u2014   expressed concerns about the number of Medicaid recipients who could suffer. The Trump administration will likely still seek to rewrite Medicaid rules and give states more leeway to limit benefits or eligibility, for example, allowing them to require certain adults in the program to have jobs or pay monthly premiums. And many Republican governors and members of Congress remain determined to curb Medicaid spending, including by methods proposed in the bill. In 2015, the nation spent more than $532 billion on Medicaid, of which about 63 percent was federal money and the rest from the states. Still, last week\u2019s defeat reflected how hard it is to take away an entitlement. It also showed the broad and deep reach of Medicaid, which covers about six times as many people as the private marketplaces created under the A. C. A. but, perhaps because the markets are more strongly associated with President Barack Obama and his law, got less attention in this month\u2019s contentious debate. Medicaid now provides medical care to four out of 10 American children. It covers the costs of nearly half of all births in the United States. It pays for the care for   of people in nursing homes. And it provides for 10 million children and adults with physical or mental disabilities. For states, it accounts for 60 percent of federal funding  \u2014   meaning that cuts hurt not only poor and   families caring for their children with autism or dying parents, but also bond ratings. The program is so woven into the nation\u2019s fabric that in 2015, almost two thirds of Americans in a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they were either covered by Medicaid or had a family member or friend who was. The program not only pays for 16 percent of all personal health care spending nationwide, but also accounts for 9 percent of federal domestic spending. Because it has always covered a patchwork of groups  \u2014   and many of its beneficiaries are poor and relatively powerless  \u2014   Medicaid lacks the unified, formidable political constituency that Social Security and Medicare have. States often have different names for the program, and many who rely on it don\u2019t realize that MassHealth in Massachusetts or TennCare in Tennessee are just Medicaid by another name. But in Kaiser\u2019s polling since 2005, the percentage of people who support cutting Medicaid spending has never exceeded 13 percent. \u201cThe conventional wisdom that there\u2019s a great deal of stigma attached to this program does not bear out in the public opinion data,\u201d said Mollyann Brodie, who oversees polling for the foundation. President Trump led the charge for the bill that would have slashed Medicaid, but he recognized the program\u2019s political potency during his campaign, proclaiming when he announced his candidacy that Medicaid should be saved \u201cwithout cuts\u201d and repeatedly taking to Twitter to declare his support for it. \u201cThe Republicans who want to cut SS and Medicaid are wrong,\u201d he wrote in July 2015. The C. B. O. report made it clear that within a few years, the cuts to Medicaid in the Republican bill would have been felt by millions of Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s health care for a huge chunk of the country,\u201d said James A. Morone, a   professor at Brown University, \u201cand as Donald Trump discovered, it\u2019s really, really complicated to mess around with. \u201d As he waited to see what would happen to the Republican proposal last week, Myrone Pickett said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a question mark hanging over my head. \u201d Mr. Pickett, of Bloomfield, N. J. got health insurance under the A. C. A. \u2019s expansion of Medicaid, and has used it for monthly shots of Vivitrol, a drug that reduces cravings for opioids and alcohol. A heroin addict for 16 years, Mr. Pickett, 51, said the treatment had helped him stay clean for the past year, get medication for bipolar disorder and land a job at a grocery store. The A. C. A. offered a tempting deal to states that agreed to expand Medicaid eligibility to everyone with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level  \u2014   $16, 400 for a single person  \u2014   mostly   workers like cooks, hairdressers and cashiers. The federal government would initially pay 100 percent of the costs of covering their medical care, and never less than 90 percent under the terms of the law. Over the past three years, 31 states and the District of Columbia took the deal. The move was especially helpful to states overwhelmed by the opioid epidemic. It required Medicaid to cover addiction and mental health treatment for those newly eligible. Announcing his vote against the G. O. P. proposal last week, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican who represents a politically moderate district north of Philadelphia, said his top concern was \u201cthe impact on the single most important issue plaguing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, and the issue that I have made my priority in Congress: opioid abuse prevention, treatment and recovery. \u201d The Republican bill would have allowed Medicaid payments to grow per person at an inflation rate that would have eroded their value over time. The C. B. O. estimated that states would have gradually had to devote more of their own money to Medicaid, cut payments to doctors, tighten eligibility or cut services covered. In 2020, states would have started losing the 90 percent federal match for anyone who had gained Medicaid under the A. C. A. expansion but was dropped from the rolls, even briefly. And the bill required beneficiaries in the expansion population to   every six months, instead of annually, increasing the likelihood that many would be dropped. As a result, the C. B. O. estimated that by 2026, less than 5 percent of Medicaid recipients enrolled under the A. C. A. would have been covered at the higher matching rate. But more broadly, the cuts would have almost inevitably affected every group covered by Medicaid, including the biggest block of recipients: 36 million children as of last year. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington State Republican, announced her \u201cno\u201d vote on the bill Thursday, saying, \u201cProtecting vulnerable children is a core purpose of the Medicaid program and when the program fails to do so, it fails entirely. \u201d The cuts would also likely have eventually hit poor, chronically ill mothers like Tracie Scott of Paulding, Ohio. She has multiple sclerosis and quit her job at a dollar store two years ago because of it. Medicaid covers her and her four children, including her    daughter and an    son with   disease who has needed expensive medication and care for frequent fractures. \u201cI\u2019d be afraid to see some of the bills for my son,\u201d Ms. Scott, 30, said as she cradled her newborn, Izabella, in their hospital room recently. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lifesaver. \u201d For more than six million Americans older than 64, Medicaid pays for nursing homes and other   care that they would never otherwise be able to afford, while Medicare covers their medical care. The threat to such care propelled Representative Webster, whose Central Florida district includes The Villages, a retirement community with more than 150, 000 residents, to lean \u201cno\u201d on the bill. \u201cThis uniquely impacted Florida and our growing senior population that\u2019s only going to explode in years to come,\u201d said Jaryn Emhof, his spokeswoman. Representative Smith of New Jersey said he was voting no because of concerns about the impact on people with disabilities, who make up just 15 percent of all Medicaid recipients but account for 42 percent of spending, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts. For millions of disabled people, Medicaid covers services provided at home or through local programs  \u2014   aides who help them walk, eat and bathe, for example, and physical and speech therapy  \u2014   that allow them to stay out of institutions, where care is often more expensive. But those services are optional for states, while the cost of institutional care is not. The law would have given states an incentive to place them in institutions. Medicaid pays for Barbara Theus, 67, to attend a day program in Southfield, Mich. so that her son and caregiver, Royale Theus, can work. Ms. Theus sustained a serious head injury in a car accident 11 years ago and has not been able to care for herself since then. Medicaid also pays for home health aides who help Ms. Theus, a former nurse who did not have much savings at the time of her accident, get showered and fed. Mr. Theus was relieved when the bill failed. Had his mother lost coverage, he said, he would have had to leave his job to care for her. \u201cI was hopeful that the powers that be would make the best decisions for the people, and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d he said. This was the third major effort by Republicans to end Medicaid as an   entitlement. The first was under President Ronald Reagan, the second was in 1995, after President Bill Clinton\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to expand health care coverage. But this was the first time Republicans tried it while they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress. For all the battles over the years, Medicaid started as something of an afterthought. By 1960, both parties were worried that the country\u2019s growing reliance on   insurance was leaving out elderly people, who were unable to pay the rapidly rising cost of health care. The night of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination in November 1963, Lyndon Johnson returned to his home in Washington and, unable to sleep, summoned three aides. \u201cThat\u2019s when he took out his pen and wrote down the priorities that he was going to pursue,\u201d one of those aides, Bill Moyers, recalled in an interview. Among them was government health insurance. President Harry S. Truman had sought to establish national health insurance  \u2014   and failed. Democrats decided to take on a more limited goal: insurance for elderly people. They called it Medicare. Democrats pushed for it to cover hospital bills for the elderly Republicans wanted it to pay for private doctor\u2019s bills. The American Medical Association had long lobbied against Medicare, hiring Reagan, then a Hollywood actor, to be the face of its campaign, producing a 1961 LP titled \u201cRonald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine. \u201d And the doctors\u2019 group had an ally in Wilbur Mills, a conservative Democrat who was chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, who like the doctors\u2019 group did not think that   elderly people should have their bills covered. In 1960, Mr. Mills had   a law that established a small program to help the states treat the needy, as a way to stave off proposals for Medicare. The doctors\u2019 group suggested expanding this program, preferring it because it would be administered by states, not the federal government. Mr. Mills had a change of heart after Johnson\u2019s landslide victory in 1964. Johnson\u2019s Republican opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, had denounced Medicare, and Mr. Mills, and many Republicans, were eager to distance themselves from him. In early 1965, Mr. Mills proposed what became known as the   cake: Medicare for hospital insurance, Medicare for doctor\u2019s bills and a broadened version of the law that helped states pay for the care of the poor, the program that would become Medicaid. \u201cHardly anybody talked about Medicaid,\u201d said Paul Starr, a sociology professor at Princeton. \u201cIt just got added on. \u201d At first, Medicaid helped states provide medical care only for single parents and children on welfare. Over the next 25 years, Democrats  \u2014   sometimes working with Republicans  \u2014   gradually pushed to expand benefits  \u2014   to   families, to children with speech and development delays, to home treatment for people who would otherwise be institutionalized, to children up to age 5, then to age 8 and later to age 18, and to pregnant women. Ironically, some of the biggest expansions in Medicaid came in the 1980s under Reagan, the onetime A. M. A. mouthpiece. After Republicans failed to turn Medicaid into a block grant, Democrats, who still controlled Congress, worked on compromises with the president and other Republicans, sometimes allowing cuts in programs like Medicare in exchange for expanding Medicaid, said former Representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat who shepherded many of those expansions. Democrats carefully calibrated each expansion to fit within the annual budget, submitting plans to the Congressional Budget Office for \u201cscoring,\u201d to see how much each would cost. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do it all at once because we didn\u2019t have enough money in the budgets,\u201d Mr. Waxman said. But eventually, the goal to decouple Medicaid from the welfare system was achieved. \u201cWe broke the link to welfare,\u201d he said. By the 1980s and \u201990s, health insurance was becoming prohibitively costly, and wages were starting to stagnate.   health insurance was eroding. States led by Republicans as well as Democrats began to expand their Medicaid programs. \u201cWhat people began to accept, including Republicans, was that the assumption that you could afford health insurance if you were an   adult was not true,\u201d said Colleen M. Grogan, a professor at the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago, who has written extensively on health care. \u201cYou could be working and still not afford health insurance. \u201d In 1996, Mr. Clinton expanded Medicaid to cover more working families as part of his welfare overhaul. Campaigning for   that year, he depicted Medicaid as a   program, telling audiences it was helping their grandparents. \u201cHe is the first Democrat to start calling Medicaid one of \u2018our programs,\u2019\u201d said Professor Morone of Brown. \u201cThere was a sense that Medicaid had sort of grown up as an entitlement. \u201d The expansion of Medicaid in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, passed with Republican sponsorship in 1997, set the stage for the sweeping expansions of the Affordable Care Act 13 years later. But politics during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency had become highly polarized. While earlier expansions of Medicaid had sometimes been bipartisan, the A. C. A. passed without a single Republican vote in Congress. The Tea Party had risen in opposition to the legislation, and later helped elect many of those who now form the conservative Freedom Caucus. Gradually, though,   states have adopted the expansion. And now that the law known as Obamacare has survived the effort to repeal it, more states may choose to expand Medicaid. In Maine, voters will decide this fall whether to do so, and in Kansas, the Legislature has all but approved an expansion, although Gov. Sam Brownback could veto it. Last week, despite their desire to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s biggest domestic legacy, some Republicans recognized that any bill that would lead to such drastic cuts in Medicaid would simply hurt too many of their constituents. In Ashland, Va. Medicaid made it possible for Kim Goodloe and her husband, Tom, to start a small company making metal parts for semiconductors and medical devices after the birth of twin boys with tuberous sclerosis 27 years ago. The genetic disorder causes tumors in vital organs, leading to frequent seizures, and Mrs. Goodloe had quit her job to take care of the boys when they were 4  \u2014   Medicaid did not cover services for them back then. But now, Medicaid provides a home aide for Matthew, who is incontinent and nonverbal, suffers daily seizures and needs help walking. For the other twin, Christopher, who is less severely developmentally disabled, Medicaid provided a job coach, helping him to work at their company and earn enough money that he now pays taxes. The Goodloes have private insurance, but it is not required to pay for the twins\u2019 services, she said. With Virginia facing such steep cuts to its federal Medicaid payments, Mrs. Goodloe worried about losing the home health aide. They would have had to downsize the business, which employs 30 people. \u201cEven within my own family, when you say \u2018Medicaid\u2019 it comes with some, \u2018Those people don\u2019t want to work.\u2019 They believe there\u2019s a lot of fraud, there\u2019s people that don\u2019t deserve it. \u201d \u201cBut then,\u201d she said, \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018How could they take it away from Matthew? \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564164.6646183}
