He also weighed in on Lady Gaga\u2019s halftime performance, calling it \u201cboring\u201d and not overly political, but adding, \u201cShe mentioned God. That frankly, to me, more than offset what else she did, and I saw Eric Deggans from NPR, their media guy, complaining that she had missed an opportunity for her to be more political. \u201d Gainor also addressed how much the media were pulling for Atlanta over the Patriots, \u201cespecially because of the ties of Trump, Kraft, Belichick, and Brady altogether,\u201d he said. He continued, \u201cThe media wanted them to lose because of that. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
