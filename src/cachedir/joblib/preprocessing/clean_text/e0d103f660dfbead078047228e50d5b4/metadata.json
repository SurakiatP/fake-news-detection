Known mostly by its Spanish name, the   vaquita is the world\u2019s smallest cetacean, a miniature porpoise with a cartoonlike features and dark smudges around its eyes. The species lives only in the fertile waters of the gulf\u2019s northern corner. The size of its population has always been precarious, but now voracious demand in China for a fish that shares the vaquita\u2019s only habitat has pushed the tiny porpoise to the brink of extinction. No more than 30 vaquitas are left, according to a November estimate based on monitoring of their echolocation clicks. Half of the vaquitas counted a year earlier have disappeared. This calamity has hardly gone unnoticed. The vaquita has been vanishing in plain sight, to the despair of conservationists who have been advising the Mexican government on how to save it. All of the resources brought to bear, including the protection of the Mexican Navy, have proved to be no match against the illegal wildlife trade. \u201cIf we continue on the path we\u2019re on, we\u2019ll have no vaquitas in two years,\u201d said Barbara Taylor, a marine mammal expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The vaquita are simply bycatch, trapped and drowned in curtains of illegal gillnets set for an endangered fish called the totoaba. The fish\u2019s swim bladder is dried and smuggled to China, where wealthy diners pay thousands of dollars for the delicacy, believing it to have medicinal powers. To feed that appetite, totoaba poachers have killed 90 percent of the vaquita population since 2011, according to the acoustic monitoring program led by Armando Jaramillo Legorreta at the Mexican government\u2019s National Ecology and Climate Change Institute, known as INECC. With so few vaquitas left, experts advising the Mexican government have proposed capturing several specimens and holding them in a sea pen as a way of conserving the species until the threat to its habitat is removed. It\u2019s a   measure that conservationists had hoped they would never have to resort to. \u201cWe had always been opposed to captivity,\u201d said Lorenzo Rojas Bracho, a marine mammal expert at INECC and the chairman of an advisory group, the International Committee for Vaquita Recovery. But nobody expected that the population would decline so quickly. \u201cThere are risks,\u201d Dr. Rojas Bracho said of the capture plan. \u201cBut they are fewer than leaving them with the fishing as it is. \u201d The plan would entail training United States Navy dolphins to locate vaquitas, capturing them for transfer to a temporary pool and then to a sea pen to be built in their habitat along the Gulf of California coast. The majority of vaquitas would remain in the wild. But the unknowns loom large. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether they find them,\u201d Dr. Taylor said of the dolphins. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether we can catch them. We don\u2019t know how they will react. \u201d \u201cIf you get a negative result in any one of these steps,\u201d she added, \u201cit\u2019s basically game over\u201d for the capture plan. Even in the best of scenarios, breeding in captivity is unlikely to restore the population. A female vaquita gives birth to one calf every two years on average. If the proposal goes forward, the vaquita would join other species at the brink of extinction  \u2014   like the California condor and the golden lion tamarin, in Brazil  \u2014   that are being closely managed in some form distinct from their natural setting. It would be the first such effort for a marine mammal. A very small population can be pulled back from the edge, but \u201cit requires    thinking,\u201d said Samuel Turvey, a research fellow at the Zoological Society of London who studies conservation management for highly threatened species. A   plan designed with the expectation that the animals can eventually be returned to the wild \u201cis not a permanent solution,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency stopgap with an exit strategy. \u201d Nor would it be a quick fix. \u201cIt requires intensive sustained efforts for decades to recover species from these catastrophic low levels,\u201d said Richard Young, the head of conservation science at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust . Dr. Turvey speaks from experience. He witnessed the first   extinction of a cetacean, the Yangtze River dolphin. Like the vaquita, the baiji, as it was more commonly known, occupied a limited habitat in small numbers and was decimated as bycatch in local fisheries. For a decade, researchers discussed removing individual baiji to a   reserve as a   conservation measure. But when Dr. Turvey and other researchers led an expedition down the Yangtze in 2006 to look for specimens, they found none. The baiji \u201conly became a story when it was gone,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit was really dark and upsetting. \u201d It is an experience that Dr. Taylor, who was on the expedition, hopes not to repeat. \u201cIt\u2019s idealistic to think that we\u2019re going to effect the significant changes in fisheries and enforcement practices in the wild in time to save vaquitas,\u201d she said. If anything, those efforts have reached a nadir. Two years ago, the Mexican government imposed a   ban on all gillnets across 5, 000 square miles of the vaquita habitat and sent its Navy to enforce it. To support the communities of the upper Gulf, which depend on fishing and shrimping, the government allocated $74 million in compensation over the two years. The hope was that the military could halt the totoaba trade and that two years would be long enough to complete development of   trawl nets to substitute for shrimp gillnets. (Even before the totoaba trade surged, legal gillnet fishing had depleted the vaquita population.) But local fishermen argue that the new nets\u2019 catches are too meager to provide a living, and the authorities have been sympathetic. \u201cWhile there is no alternative to fishing practices, nobody will give up their gillnets,\u201d Dr. Rojas Bracho said. The promised enforcement also has fallen short. That was evident this month aboard the Sam Simon, a   antipoaching vessel operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an environmental organization. In an agreement with the Mexican Navy, Sea Shepherd has been patrolling the vaquita habitat, pulling illegal nets out of the water and spotting poachers. \u201cWe see illegal activity almost every day,\u201d said Oona Layolle, the leader of the Sea Shepherd campaign, called Operation Milagro (Spanish for \u201cmiracle\u201d). At about 4 p. m. one afternoon this month, a fishing boat pulled up just a few hundred meters from the Sam Simon carrying four men guided by a   GPS device. One of the men dragged a hook in the water, looking for a gillnet they had hidden there. The Sam Simon sent a drone over the small boat and it sped off, only to return with six men aboard, who threw objects at the drone before leaving again. Despite a call to the Mexican Navy, nobody came. Even when arrests are made, conservationists say, the prosecution is too slapdash to win a conviction for a serious crime. Last year, Mexican Navy patrols succeeded in scaring off the totoaba poachers by day, forcing them to haul in their nets at night. But this year, the poachers work openly during the day, some wearing balaclavas, apparently undeterred by desultory government patrols. Some poachers even post photos of their weapons on Facebook. At the same time, four boats belonging to Mexico\u2019s environmental prosecutor are parked on a side street running above the dock here, their motors broken or simply unused because fuel is in short supply. The nets tell a similar tale. Over 10 weeks last spring, Operation Milagro pulled 42 totoaba nets from these waters. In the fall, a broad   survey succeeded in finding 36 totoaba nets, 28 of which were in use. In   Operation Milgro resumed and found 56 more totoaba nets in nine weeks. Almost all were new, and some were set in the same places that the government effort had cleared just weeks earlier. During night patrol aboard the Sam Simon last week, the crew pulled up yet another totoaba net of wide blue mesh, its unweathered red buoys evidence that the net was brand new. \u201cThe situation is so dramatic that we have to take huge measures,\u201d Ms. Layolle said. \u201cIt is a desperate time. \u201d Mexico\u2019s environment minister, Rafael Pacchiano Alam\u00e1n, promised this month to send 45 federal police officers to patrol the beaches and to dismantle poachers\u2019 camps. But he did not respond to the main recommendation of conservationists: a permanent gillnet ban. The legal fishing season for corvina has begun, which usually means that dozens of small boats are on the water, giving cover to poachers. But this year the Mexican government has so far declined to grant any fishing permits. Despite a promise last year by President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the government has yet to act on the gillnet ban. Without that, warn conservationists, there is no way to begin to save the vaquita. \u201cIf you can\u2019t remove the threats, the population keeps declining,\u201d Dr. Turvey said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time for complacency. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628438.2173207}
