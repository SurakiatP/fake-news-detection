[Israeli deputy Oren Hazan gave his support and endorsement to Ms. Le Pen on Twitter on Wednesday before the   long debate that evening. Mr. Hazan wrote: \u201cMadame Le Pen, I offer my support for the debate this evening as well as during the second round of the election on Sunday for the construction of the future of France,\u201d The Times of Israel reports.  Madame Le Pen, au d\u00e9bat ce soir j\u2019apporte mon soutien, aussi au second tour  \u2014   pour la construction de l\u2019avenir de la France \ud83c\uddf7@MLP_officiel,  \u2014   \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05df \u05d7\u05d6\u05df (@oren_haz) May 3, 2017,  Hazan has been a Member of the Israeli Knesset since 2015 and has been considered somewhat of a firebrand in Israeli politics. The MK has been a keen supporter of U. S. President Donald Trump during the presidential campaign last year. Despite a negative reaction from many in his own party who have called for him to be excluded from future elections, Hazan has defended his remarks. In an interview with Israeli broadcaster, i24 News Hazan said: \u201cA lot of other members of the House say in private that they support Marine Le Pen but are afraid to [say so publicly]. \u201d \u201cMarine Le Pen took all the bad,   things her father did and kicked him out of his own party,\u201d Hazan added saying Le Pen had transformed the Front National and manoeuvred it away from its controversial past. \u201cWhen I put my support in Marine Le Pen I looked at the State of Israel\u2019s interests for safety, security, fighting radical Islam, and fighting terror,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a few years if nothing changes France is going to be a radical Islam[ic] country. We want to stop this. I don\u2019t think the left side of the political map can do it. I believe she can do it. \u201d The Front National made an attempt to reach out to Israeli lawmakers earlier this year when Party Secretary Nicolas Bay made a brief visit to the country. Bay met with several prominent Israelis in an effort to normalise relations between Israel and the Front National. \u201cIsrael is the front wall that is fighting against radical Islam and terror all around the world,\u201d Hazan said. \u201cWe need more people who don\u2019t speak \u2018politically correct\u2019 and see eye to eye [with Israel]. \u201d In France, the number of   incidents has rapidly risen over the past few years and often Jewish people are targetted by radical Islamists. The situation has become so difficult for French Jews that a record number have left for Israel.
