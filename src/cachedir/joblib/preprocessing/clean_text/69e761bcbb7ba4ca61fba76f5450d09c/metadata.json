[At a meeting on the Hill late Thursday night, the speaker and his House Republican leadership team decided to further delay the vote. With what appeared to be the acquiescence of conservatives in the Freedom Caucus and   like Club for Growth and FreedomWorks, who took much of the blame for the failure of the first attempt to pass the American Health Care Act (AHCA) in March, hopes were buoyed that passage was imminent. Instead, according to Politico, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( ) told reporters as he left the meeting, \u201cWe are not voting on health care tomorrow. We\u2019re still educating members. \u201d  Syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham joined Fox News\u2019s Hannity to vent her frustration with House Republicans. \u201cThis is another loss for Paul Ryan,\u201d she told host Sean Hannity: Paul Ryan was given this assignment to quarterback this legislation through the House. It wasn\u2019t easy. It was going to be difficult. You have a lot of different factions, different people, different values, different personalities, but this is something you had to do. If you can\u2019t get health care done, and done right, eight years after saying you were gonna do it   \u2026     I don\u2019t even know what to say about that. What does that say about your ability to lead at a critical time for our economy? Ingraham then hinted she may be at the end of her patience with Speaker Ryan\u2019s leadership. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna sugarcoat this. This is an embarrassment that this couldn\u2019t get done,\u201d she fumed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get better communications. You have to know your caucus. Otherwise, just give it to someone who can do it. That\u2019s all I can say\u201d: Hannity\u2019s next guest, fellow Fox host Lou Dobbs, went even further in his condemnation of Ryan\u2019s handling of healthcare legislation. \u201cLaura, bless her heart, is trying to be nice to Paul Ryan,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the man is absolutely a disaster. He\u2019s become nothing less than a caricature as House speaker. He\u2019s inept, and the conference, if they don\u2019t get rid of him, we\u2019re going to watch this nonsense go on in perpetuity. \u201d Dobbs explained that, in his view, President Trump was doing all he could to move his political agenda along and that House GOP leadership had to be held responsible for the sluggish pace on legislative priorities. He then explicitly called for Speaker Ryan\u2019s ouster and replacement by Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) chairman of the   Freedom Caucus, or his predecessor in that position, Rep. Jim Jordan ( ): Paul Ryan is not a conservative, never has been. His leadership team is a mixed bag of conservatives [and] moderates. The Freedom Caucus are traditional conservatives and great Americans, all of them.   \u2026     You and I both know Mark [Meadows] and Jim Jordan   \u2026     for the great Republicans they are. I think either one of those two would make such a terrific speaker. Dobbs\u2019s suggestion would not be the first time Paul Ryan and the Freedom Caucus found themselves in contention. Members of the Freedom Caucus themselves have called Ryan\u2019s continuation as speaker of the House into question. The entire Freedom Caucus leadership also refused to endorse Ryan in his 2016 primary challenge from the right by businessman Paul Nehlen, although they did assent to Ryan\u2019s speakership the previous year. Ingraham and Dobbs\u2019s comments add to a growing chorus of voices on the right of the Republican Party calling for Ryan to relinquish the speaker\u2019s mace in the wake of the failure to see through the key GOP platform plank of repealing and replacing Obamacare.'"}, "time": 1742564326.9672606}
