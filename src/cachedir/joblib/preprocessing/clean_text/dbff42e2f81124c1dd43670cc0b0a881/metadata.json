In this incident, the American pilot reportedly attempted to communicate with the Russian warplane but was unsuccessful. \\nHarrigian also reported an increase in close encounters between American and Russian military jets in the region in the past six weeks. He said that Russian jets have intentionally flown close to U.S. warplanes about once every 10 days. \\nTensions between the United States and Russia have been exacerbated over the situation in Syria in recent weeks, following a failed ceasefire deal and suspension of communications between the two countries. \\nRussian and Syrian jets have bombed civilians and U.S.-backed rebels in Aleppo, drawing ire from America. Moscow has threatened to shoot down coalition jets that target Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces with air strikes in Syria, after reports indicated that the Obama administration would consider targeting Syrian government forces with strikes.'"}, "time": 1742561896.9057908}
