Followers of the movement also displayed an almost violent patriotic loyalty to the 1st Amendment of the Constitution, which they claim Donald Trump would dismantle once in power. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartwarming to see such large crowds. But, where were you assholes yesterday,\u201d shared one of the movement\u2019s leaders Hillary Clinton. \\nClinton, criticised for her populism which has seen her join the calls for another vote, is looking to tap into the sort of post-Brexit come down, which saw half of Britain \u2018shit their pants\u2019 and wish they could vote all over again. \\nThe movement has drawn the attention of mainstream media which remains suspicious of Make America Vote Again, due to the face it is occurring online through social media channel outside the confines of the news media. \\n\u201cIt goes against our values, principles and ideals, it\u2019s not something anyone likes to see,\u201d confirmed Republican strategist Noren Hassleback. \\n\u201cHaving said that, despite the move being unconstitutional, many of the utterances bordering on being treasonous and discriminatory\u2026 they might be onto something\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742562833.2195096}
