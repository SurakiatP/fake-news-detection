The incident was at night and none of the planes had any lights on. \\nUS Air Force Lt. Gen. Jeff Harrigian chalked the matter up to inferior Russian pilots, saying that it was because the pilot did not have \u201cthe necessary situational awareness\u201d and simply didn\u2019t see that there was a US warplane flying around in the area. \\nThe US is eager to hype any such incidents as proof of Russia\u2019s \u201cunsafe and unprofessional behavior\u201d in Syria, though a major factor in this is that the US dramatically curtailed information sharing with Russia in Syria after the last ceasefire failed. \\nDetails on the incident are still minimal, but it was described as happening in \u201ceastern Syria.\u201d This is unusual because, while Russian warplanes tend to operate in that area, where al-Qaeda\u2019s Nusra Front holds significant territory, the US generally does not, and US airstrikes are more or less exclusively in the northwest of the country.
