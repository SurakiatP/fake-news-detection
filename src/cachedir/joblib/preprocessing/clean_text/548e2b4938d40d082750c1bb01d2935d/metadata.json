Humayun Khan would still be alive if he had been president. https://t.co/VgLaQ0cJ3A pic.twitter.com/bcDiTMXY2k \\n\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 26, 2016 \\nTrump said, \u201cI have great respect for the Khan family, I have great respect for \u2013 I mean their son is a great hero \u2013 but if I were president at that time, Capt. Khan would be alive today, George, because I wouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq \u2026 I was opposed to the war in Iraq.\u201d \\nAs Hillary Clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign, Donald Trump was not opposed to the war in Iraq from the beginning. Had he been president at the time, the war still would have taken place because Trump was in favor of it. \\nIn fact, Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies. This would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that America gets mired in more conflicts, not less. \\nFor their part, the Clinton campaign has continued to stand up to Trump\u2019s attacks on the Khan family. In an emotional new ad released days ago, Capt. Khan\u2019s father recounts how his son died protecting \u201ceveryone in his unit.\u201d Khan\u2019s father asked of Trump, \u201cWould my son have a place in your America?\u201d \\nThe answer to Mr. Khan\u2019s question is a resounding \u201cno,\u201d as Trump has promised to ban Muslims \u2013 like the Khans \u2013 from even entering the United States. For those living here already, a President Trump would treat them like criminals. \\nDonald Trump will likely continue to rewrite history when it comes to his initial support of military intervention in Iraq. But after spending so much time throwing mud at the Khan family, it\u2019s unlikely that anybody will buy it.'"}, "time": 1742628454.4547331}
