[Instead, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is announcing it will hold summer camps for community organizers, dubbed the Summer Resistance program.  \u201cThere has been an explosion of activism and energy after the election of Donald Trump, and we need to turn this moment into a movement, DNC chairman Tom Perez is quoted in the press release announcing the plan. \u201cAs the Democratic Party, it is our role to support this activism and energy, and convert it into electoral wins    the ballot by making sure state parties have the tools and resources they need to succeed. \u201d To that end, the DNC will pump money in the form of grants into state party programs. \u201cThe program is a competitive matching grant program, where the DNC will approve and fund programs that will be executed by state parties,\u201d the press release states. \u201cRecognizing that a     approach is ineffective, each grant proposal will be unique to the state\u2019s strategic priorities and organizational capacity. \u201cPart of these plans must incorporate, where legally possible, partners and allies,\u201d the press release states. DNC Deputy Chairman Keith Ellison, who lost the chairmanship to Perez but still got a leadership position on the committee nonetheless, used #Resistance in his remarks about the summer camps. \u201cThe best way for Democrats to turn the #Resistance into electoral wins is by doing one thing: organizing,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cResistance Summer is the starting point and will take the Democratic Party\u2019s message of fairness and equality to activists on the front lines and all Americans looking to get engaged. \u201d Then Ellison, ironically, names some of the reasons President Donald Trump was elected: \u201cThe American people want affordable health care for all, good jobs that pay well, and a tax code that rewards hard work,\u201d Ellison said, adding that Democrats \u201chave never had a better opportunity to win    the ballot. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561831.0195668}
