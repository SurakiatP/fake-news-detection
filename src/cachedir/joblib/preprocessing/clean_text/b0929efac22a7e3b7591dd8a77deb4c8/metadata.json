Three miles above the Pacific, you are above almost half the oxygen in Earth\u2019s atmosphere and every step hurts. A few minutes in the sun will fry your skin. Brains and fingers go numb. At night, the stars are so close they seem tangled in your hair. Two years ago, this mountaintop was the scene of a cosmic traffic jam: honking horns, vans and trucks full of astronomers, V. I. P. s, journalists, businesspeople, politicians, protesters and police  \u2014   all snarled at a roadblock just short of the summit. Abandoning their cars, some of the visitors started to hike up the hill toward what would have been a groundbreaking for the biggest and most expensive stargazing machinery ever built in the Northern Hemisphere: the Thirty Meter Telescope, 14 years and $1. 4 billion in the making. They were assembling on a plateau just below the summit, when Joshua Mangauil, better known by his Hawaiian name of Lanakila, then 27, barged onto the scene. Resplendent in a tapa cloth, beads, a red loin cloth, his jet black hair in a long Mohawk, he had hiked over the volcano\u2019s cinder cones barefoot. \u201cLike snakes you are. Vile snakes,\u201d he yelled. \u201cWe gave all of our aloha to you guys, and you slithered past us like snakes. \u201d \u201cFor what? For your greed to look into the sky? You guys can\u2019t take care of this place. \u201d No ground was broken that day or since. To astronomers, the Thirty Meter Telescope would be a   tool to spy on planets around other stars or to peer into the cores of ancient galaxies, with an eye sharper and more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, another landmark in humanity\u2019s quest to understand its origins. But to its opponents, the telescope would be yet another eyesore despoiling an ancient sacred landscape, a gigantic   colossus joining the 13 telescopes already on Mauna Kea. Later this month, proponents and opponents of the giant telescope will face off in a hotel room in the nearby city of Hilo for the start of hearings that will lead to a decision on whether the telescope can be legally erected on the mountain. Over the years, some have portrayed this fight as a struggle between superstition and science. Others view the telescope as another symbol of how Hawaiians have been unfairly treated since Congress annexed the islands  \u2014   illegally in the eyes of many  \u2014   in 1898. And still others believe it will bring technology and economic development to an impoverished island. \u201cThis is a very simple case about land use,\u201d Kealoha Pisciotta, a former telescope operator on Mauna Kea who has been one of the leaders of a group fighting telescope development on the mountain for the last decade. \u201cIt\u2019s not science versus religion. We\u2019re not the church. You\u2019re not Galileo. \u201d Hanging in the balance is perhaps the best stargazing site on Earth. \u201cMauna Kea is the flagship of American and international astronomy,\u201d said Doug Simons, the director of the    Telescope on Mauna Kea. \u201cWe are on the precipice of losing this cornerstone of U. S. prestige. \u201d The road to the stars once ended in California at Palomar Mountain, whose    telescope was long considered the size limit. The bigger a telescope mirror is, the more light it can capture and the fainter and farther it can see  \u2014   out in space, back in time. In the 1990s, however, astronomers learned how to build telescopes with thin mirrors that relied on   supports to keep them from sagging or warping. There was an explosion of telescope building that has culminated, for now, in plans for three giant   telescopes: the European Extremely Large Telescope and the Giant Magellan, both in Chile, and the Thirty Meter Telescope. Not only would they have a Brobdingnagian appetite for light, but they are designed to incorporate a new technology called adaptive optics, which can take the twinkle out of starlight by adjusting telescope mirrors to compensate for atmospheric turbulence. Richard Ellis, a British astronomer now at the European Southern Observatory in Garching, Germany, recalled being optimistic in 1999 when he arrived at the California Institute of Technology to begin developing what became known as the Thirty Meter Telescope. \u201cThe stock market was booming,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything seemed possible. \u201d Canada, India and Japan eventually joined the project, now officially known as the TMT International Observatory. It has been helped along by  the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, formed by the founder of Intel, which has contributed advice and $180 million. The telescope, originally scheduled to be completed by 2024, is modeled on the revolutionary    Keck telescopes that Caltech and the University of California operate on Mauna Kea. Like them, it will have with a segmented mirror composed of small, hexagonal pieces of glass fitted together into an expanse wider than a tennis court. There are only a few places on Earth that are dark, dry and calm enough to be fit for a   telescope. Rising 33, 000 feet from the seafloor, Mauna Kea is one of the biggest mountains in the solar system. The dormant ancient volcano has been the center of Polynesian culture  \u2014   the umbilical cord connecting Earth and sky  \u2014   seemingly forever. The mountain is part of   \u201cceded lands\u201d that originally belonged to the Hawaiian Kingdom and are now administered by the state for the benefit of Hawaiians. On its spare, merciless summit, craters and cinder cones of indefinable age keep company with a variety pack of architectural shapes housing telescopes. In 1968 the University of Hawaii took out a   lease on 11, 000 acres for a dollar a year. Some 500 acres of that are designated as a science preserve. It includes the ice age quarry from which stone tools were being cut a thousand years ago, and hundreds of shrines and burial grounds. The first telescope went up in 1970. Many rapidly followed. Places like Mauna Kea are \u201ccradles of knowledge,\u201d said Natalie Batalha, one of the leaders of NASA\u2019s Kepler   mission. \u201cI am filled with reverence and humility every time I get to be physically present at a mountaintop observatory. \u201d But some Hawaiians worried that knowledge was coming at too great a cost. \u201cAll those telescopes got put up with no thought beyond reviving the Hilo economy,\u201d said Michael Bolte, an astronomer from the University of California, Santa Cruz, who serves on the TMT board. \u201cNot a lot of thought was given to culture issues. \u201d Some native Hawaiians complained that their beloved mountain had grown \u201cpimples,\u201d and that the telescope development had interfered with cultural and religious practices that are protected by state law. Construction trash sometimes rolled down the mountain, said Nelson Ho, a photographer and Sierra Club leader who complained to the university. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just kept playing king of the mountain. \u201d An audit by the State of Hawaii in 1998 scolded the university for failing to protect the mountain and its natural and cultural resources. An environmental impact study performed by NASA in 2007 similarly concluded that 30 years of astronomy had caused \u201csignificant, substantial and adverse\u201d harm to Mauna Kea. The tide began to shift in 2001 when NASA announced a plan to add six small telescopes called outriggers to the Keck complex. The outriggers would be used in concert with the big telescopes as interferometers to test ideas a for a future space mission dedicated to looking for planets around other stars. Ms. Pisciotta led a band of environmentalists and cultural practitioners who went to court to stop NASA. The group included the Hawaiian chapter of the Sierra Club and the Royal Order of Kamehameha, devoted to restoring the Kingdom of Hawaii. Ms. Pisciotta said she had once dreamed of being a cosmologist but lacked the requisite math skills and instead took a night job operating a radio telescope on Mauna Kea. She became disenchanted when a family shrine disappeared from the summit and the plans for the outriggers impinged on a cinder cone. \u201cCinder cones are burial sites. It\u2019s time to not let this go on,\u201d she said. The group prepared for court by reading popular books about trials. In 2007, Hawaii\u2019s third district court found the management plan for the outriggers was flawed and revoked the building permit. \u201cNASA packed up and left,\u201d Ms. Pisciotta said. The prospective builders of the TMT knew they had their work cut out for them. In 2007, the Moore Foundation hired Peter Adler, a consultant and sociologist, to look into the consequences of putting the telescope in Hawaii. \u201cShould TMT decide to pursue a Mauna Kea site,\u201d his report warned, \u201cit will inherit the anger, fear and great mistrust generated through previous telescope planning and siting failures and an accumulated disbelief that any additional projects, especially a physically imposing one like the TMT, can be done properly. \u201d The astronomers picked a telescope site that was less anthropologically sensitive, on a plateau below the summit with no monuments or other obvious structures on it. They agreed to pay $1 million a year, a fifth of which would go to the state\u2019s Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the rest to stewardship of the mountain. Quietly, they also pledged another $2 million a year toward science and technology education and work force development on the island of Hawaii. The Moore Foundation also put some $2 million into the Imiloa Astronomy Center, a museum and planetarium run by the University of Hawaii. Dr. Bolte, a   U. C. S. C. professor with a soothing lilt to his voice, became one of the most visible promoters of the project in community meetings. He recalled going to a meeting in Hilo once where tensions were very high. Afterward, he said, he was afraid to go out to his car. Sure enough, a crowd rushed him when he got there. \u201cWhat kind of astronomy do you do?\u201d they asked eagerly. \u201cThe aloha spirit really exists,\u201d Dr. Bolte said. \u201cExploring the universe is a wonderful thing humans do,\u201d he added. Nevertheless, \u201cthere was a core we never won over. \u201d \u201cIn retrospect, we might have underestimated the strength of the sovereignty movement. \u201d In the years since the first telescopes went up on Mauna Kea, Hawaiian people and culture had experienced a resurgence of pride known as the Hawaiian Renaissance. In 1976, a band of Hawaiians sailed the outrigger canoe Hokulea from Hawaii to Tahiti. The feat showed how ancient Polynesians could have purposefully explored and colonized the Pacific, navigating the seas using only the sun, stars, ocean swells and wind. \u201cAnd that was the first spark of shutting up everybody who said that we were inferior, that we were not intelligent,\u201d Mr. Mangauil, the protester, said. In 1978, the state recognized Hawaiian, which once had been banned from schools, as an official language. With rising pride came  \u2014   at least among some more vocal native Hawaiians  \u2014   questions about whether the occupation and annexation of Hawaii by the United States in the 1890s was legal. Telescopes on a sacred mountain constitute a form of \u201ccolonial violence,\u201d in the words of J. Kehaulani Kauanui, an anthropologist at Wesleyan University. Or as Robert Kirshner, a Harvard professor who is now also chief science officer at the Moore Foundation, put it, \u201cThe question in that case become not so much whether you did the environmental impact statement right, but whose island is it?\u201d Having cut their teeth fighting the outrigger project, Ms. Pisciotta\u2019s group, known informally as the Mauna Kea Hui, was prepared when the TMT Corporation formally selected the mountain for its site in 2009. Many Hawaiians welcomed the telescope project. At a permit hearing, Wallace Ishibashi Jr. whose family had an ancestral connection to Mauna Kea, compared the Thirty Meter\u2019s mission to the search for aumakua, the ancestral origins of the universe. \u201cHawaiians,\u201d he said, \u201chave always been a creative and adaptive people. \u201d Ms. Pisciotta and her friends argued among other things that an   observatory, which would be the biggest structure on the whole island of Hawaii, did not fit in a conservation district. In a series of hearings in 2010 and 2011, the state land board approved a permit for the telescope but then stipulated that no construction could begin until a   contested case hearing, in which interested parties could present their arguments, was held. The state won that hearing, and a groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for Oct. 7, 2014. The groundbreaking was never intended to be a public event, said Bob McClaren, associate director of the University of Hawaii\u2019s Institute for Astronomy, which is responsible for scientific activities on the mountain. \u201cI thought it was reasonable to restrict access to those who were invited,\u201d he said. Mr. Mangauil, who makes his living teaching hula dancing and Hawaiian culture, said later that he had wanted only to make the astronomers feel uncomfortable to be on the mountain and to get protesters\u2019 signs in view of the television cameras. In an interview, he said he had nothing against science or astronomy, but did not want it on his mountain. \u201cOur connection to the mountain is like, that\u2019s our elder, the mother of our resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the wau akua, the realm of where the gods live. \u201d There are no shrines on the very summit, he pointed out, which should be a lesson: Not even the most holy people are supposed to go there. Unable to get to the groundbreaking, the Hawaiians formed their own blockade. Tempers flared. \u201cWe were seeing the native Hawaiian movement flexing its muscles,\u201d Dr. Bolte said. Seeing people hiking up the mountain past the    Mr. Mangauil stormed after them and wound up on the hood of a ranger truck, even more angry. Lanakila\u2019s barefoot run set the tone for two years of unrest and demonstrations. Protesters calling themselves Guardians of the Mountain set up a permanent vigil across the road from the Mauna Kea visitor center, stopping telescope construction crews and equipment from going up. Dozens were arrested. Gov. David Ige has tried to appease both sides. While saying that \u201cwe have in many ways failed the mountain,\u201d he said the Thirty Meter Telescope should go forward, but at least three other telescopes would have to come down. Astronomers and business leaders grew frustrated that the state was not doing enough to keep the road open for construction trucks and workers. \u201cThe result of the faulty law enforcement surrounding Mauna Kea is fostering tension, aggression, racism and business uncertainty,\u201d business organizations and the Hawaii Chamber of Commerce wrote to the governor. \u201cAmbiguity surrounding the rule of law has prompted a poor economic climate. \u201d Stopping trucks on the steep slope was dangerous, said Dr. Bolte, adding that \u201cpeople were basically trapped at the summit. \u201d Dr. Simons, the    director, grew increasingly worried about the effect of the protests on the astronomers, who became reluctant to be identified as observatory staffers. \u201cIt really tugged at us to see the staff going from being proud to scared in a matter of weeks,\u201d he said. Meanwhile Ms. Pisciotta\u2018s coalition was plugging through the courts. On Dec. 2, the Hawaiian Supreme Court revoked the telescope building permit, ruling that the state had violated due process by handing out the permit before the contested case hearing. \u201cQuite simply, the Board put the cart before the horse when it issued the permit,\u201d the court wrote. By   Clarence Ching, another member of the opposition, stood in a crowd with other Hawaiians and watched trucks carrying equipment retreat from the mountain. \u201cDavid had beaten Goliath,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were even happy and sad at the same time  \u2014   sad, for instance, that somebody had to lose  \u2014   as we had fought hard and long. \u201d The court\u2019s decision set the stage for a new round of hearings, now scheduled to start in  . The case, presided over by Riki May Amano, a retired judge appointed by the Land Board, is likely to last longer than the first round, which consumed seven days of hearings over a few weeks, partly because there are more parties this time around. Among them is the   Hawaiian group called Perpetuating Unique Educational Opportunities or PUEO, who contend the benefits of the TMT to the community have been undersold. Whoever wins this fall\u2019s contested case hearing, the decision is sure to be quickly appealed to the Hawaiian Supreme Court. In an interview, Edward Stone, a Caltech professor and vice president of the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory, the group that will build the telescope, set April 2018 as the deadline for beginning construction. Depending on how it goes in Hawaii or elsewhere, the telescope could be ready sometime in the last half of the next decade. \u201cWe need to start building this thing somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still hope Hawaii will work,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat we need is a timely permit, and we need access to the mountain once we have a permit. \u201d But there is no guarantee that even if the astronomers succeed in court they will prevail on the mountain. In an email exchange, J. Douglas Ing, lawyer for the TMT Observatory, said they were \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that local agencies would uphold the law, but the astronomers have also been investigating alternative sites in Mexico, Chile, India, China and the Canary Islands. \u201cIt\u2019s wise of the TMT to be exploring other sites,\u201d said Richard Wurdeman, the lawyer for the Mauna Kea Hui. I asked Ms. Pisciotta what would happen if the giant telescope finally wins. \u201cIt would be really hard for Hawaiian people to swallow that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been our way to lift our prayers up to heaven and hope they hear us. \u201d Dr. Bolte said he had learned to not make predictions about Hawaii. In a recent email, he recalled photographing a bunch of   Hawaiian owls. \u201cThese are called pueo, and they are said to be the physical form of ancestor spirits,\u201d Dr. Bolte recounted. Referring to the Hawaiian term for a wise elder, he said, \u201cI had one kupuna tell me it was a great sign for TMT that so many pueo sought me out that trip, and another tell me it was a sign that we should leave the island immediately before a calamity falls on TMT. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562240.4673908}
