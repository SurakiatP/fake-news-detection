Advocates for the family of Paul O\u2019Neal, the    who was killed on Thursday, reacted skeptically to claims of the faulty body camera, wondering aloud why the department had invested in the technology if it did not work. \u201cIf there is not a   here, I don\u2019t know where there is one,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a lawyer who on Monday filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of the family. The shooting happened after officers chased a stolen Jaguar convertible through the South Side before it collided with a police cruiser on a residential street. Two officers opened fire. Cameras captured some early stages of the encounter, but not the fatal gunshot, apparently fired by another officer after Mr. O\u2019Neal fled the crash scene on foot. Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago police spokesman, noted that police officers in that part of the city had been using body cameras only for a few days, and said the authorities were investigating why there was no footage of the fatal gunshot. The Chicago Police Department has been criticized for a series of shootings of black men in recent years, and it is under federal investigation and still in turmoil after protests over the shooting death of a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, in 2014. The use of body cameras had been promoted as a step toward transparency. The three officers were stripped of their police powers for their actions during Thursday\u2019s shooting. The police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, who promised to rebuild trust with the community when he was promoted this year, said footage from other body cameras and a dashboard camera was \u201cvery helpful\u201d in leading him to believe department policies may have been violated. The officers were not identified, and video footage was not made public. Mr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s death is being investigated by Chicago\u2019s Independent Police Review Authority, an agency that until recently almost never faulted officers in shootings. Officials at the county and federal prosecutors\u2019 offices in Chicago declined to comment on Monday on whether they were involved in the case. While police officers in Chicago have seized 5, 000 guns this year, murders are up sharply, and the police union has cited low officer morale as the Justice Department investigation continues. Amid all of this, Mr. Johnson said it was important to recognize that a misjudgment by an officer was not necessarily intentional brutality. \u201cPolicing isn\u2019t easy,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re asking these cops to make   decisions, and sometimes they\u2019re    decisions. \u201d But grief filled the street where Mr. O\u2019Neal was shot. Near a makeshift memorial of teddy bears and signs, Ja\u2019Mal Green, an activist serving as a spokesman for the family, said Mr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s death and others like it made it difficult to repair relations between Chicago\u2019s police officers and its black residents. \u201cOnce we can have some type of cameras that work and actually show our side of the story,\u201d Mr. Green said, \u201cand actually get these officers prosecuted and hold these officers accountable, that\u2019s when we can start seeing a relationship between police and the community. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562109.3625164}
