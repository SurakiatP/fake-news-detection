[Her reviews were called \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201celitist. \u201d Dean June Chu of Yale\u2019s Pierson College used the terms \u201cwhite trash,\u201d \u201clow class folks,\u201d and \u201cuneducated morons\u201d to describe employees and patrons of local establishments in series of Yelp reviews, which were spread around the Ivy League university\u2019s community last week.   Condemning a New Haven cinema, Chu wrote that it was a place for \u2018barely educated morons trying to manage snack orders for the obese and also try to add $7 plus $7.\u2019 \u201cI am concerned about the shadow that my actions have thrown on my efforts to create an environment in Pierson that respects everyone, and I am especially concerned that it could prevent anyone from coming to me for the support that I offer to all Pierson students,\u201d Chu wrote in an apology statement. \u201cI see that I now have work to do to repair the trust you have all shown me. \u201d Although some have expressed concerns that backlash against Chu is a result of the excesses of political correctness, others argue that Chu should be held to the same politically correct standards that many Yale professors expect of their community members. Yale University has no plans to formally discipline Chu. Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
