Biden Jr. country, the city of his birth and boyhood. Now Donald J. Trump wants to make Scranton his country, too. He is hoping to make deep inroads in a Democratic stronghold with an   trade,   message, which across the Rust Belt has energized the   voters who represent his best prospect of taking up residence in the White House. Hours before Mr. Biden addressed the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Mr. Trump pulled a bit of campaign mischief on Wednesday by swooping into Scranton and dismissing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chances of winning Pennsylvania. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she has many fans here,\u201d he said of Mrs. Clinton in the city where her father was born and where she spent summers in a family cottage on Lake Winola. Echoing his promises to bring back Appalachian coal mining, Mr. Trump told a large audience in a college gym in northeastern Pennsylvania, where coal peaked in 1917 and largely died out in the 1950s, \u201cHang in there, we\u2019re going to put you back to work. \u201d His larger promise to restore   jobs by tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade deals drew cheers. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten a new job in this city for the last 20 years,\u201d said Fred Joseph, 66, a retired sales manager at a cardboard plant, who was among those who heard Mr. Trump on Wednesday. \u201cIf he gets these renegotiations with these Naftas, we can start bringing back industries and make televisions, we can make refrigerators. I saw them leave. Why won\u2019t they come back?\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s visit came a day after a former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Edward G. Rendell, said the Republican nominee\u2019s trade message \u201cresonates\u201d with the state\u2019s voters. \u201cI think Trump has a very good chance here,\u201d said Mike Fedorka, 60, a former Democratic City Council member in Dickson City, just north of Scranton. Unlike 2012, when President Obama and Mitt Romney all but ignored Pennsylvania in the expectation that it would vote Democratic, this year it is a   battleground, with the Clinton campaign and its allies building a robust field staff and saturating the television airwaves with ads. Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, will hit the Pennsylvania Turnpike for a bus trip on Friday, the day after the Democratic convention concludes. They plan to visit Scranton on Aug. 15. To win the 20 electoral votes of Pennsylvania, among the richest of the swing states in the   and upper Midwest, Mr. Trump must assemble the pieces of a complex puzzle. Democrats have won six straight victories in Pennsylvania in presidential elections. To reverse that trend, Mr. Trump must win white   voters in rural counties and small cities like Scranton, hope for low   turnout in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and hold Mrs. Clinton to a rough parity in the increasingly diverse Philadelphia suburbs. With polls showing Mr. Trump underperforming among   white voters, especially women, he has to improve on Mr. Romney\u2019s 2012 performance among the white working class, which he won by 14 percentage points in Pennsylvania. There is plenty of room for growth: Mr. Romney won these voters nationally by an even larger margin, 22 percentage points. G. Terry Madonna, a pollster and political scientist at Franklin  Marshall College, estimated that to win Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump would need a boost of six percentage points over Mr. Romney\u2019s total among white   voters. Scranton and surrounding Lackawanna County is a good place to measure his progress, because of voters\u2019 long history as loyal Democrats. It was Mr. Obama\u2019s best county in the state in 2012 after Philadelphia  \u2014   in part because of the Biden and Clinton connections. With the   work force eroding  \u2014   plants making vinyl records, televisions and body armor have closed, some of them before the enactment of trade deals  \u2014   Scranton\u2019s population has declined 25 percent since 1970. \u201cPeople who\u2019ve lived here their entire lives think things aren\u2019t as good as they used to be, so there\u2019s a significant number of people Trump can tap into based on \u2018make America great again,\u2019 \u201d said Michael Allison, a political scientist at the University of Scranton. One of those voters, George Colburn, 74, runs a business making machine parts in the Scranton borough of Old Forge. \u201cThe thing I like about Trump is he wants to go out there and bring this country back to a   country,\u201d said Mr. Colburn, who was having dinner on Tuesday night at the bar at Arcaro  Genell, one of a   locally celebrated restaurants in Old Forge that make square pizza sold by the \u201ccut. \u201d Local lore has it that while campaigning here in 2008, Mrs. Clinton was turned away by the restaurant\u2019s conservative owners and ended up in a booth at Revello\u2019s, a place across the street. Two retired math teachers at the Arcaro  Genell bar, Arthur Clark and Len Pesotini, said they would vote for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI still have my two main organs, my brain and my heart, so I\u2019m a Democrat,\u201d Mr. Clark said. Mrs. Clinton cannot afford to take the area for granted. Republicans point to the 3, 000 Democrats in Lackawanna County who switched their voter registrations to Republican, compared with about 500 Republicans who went the other way. And Mrs. Clinton won 47 percent fewer votes in the county in the April primary than she did in 2008. Still, Mrs. Clinton won more votes in Lackawanna County\u2019s primary this year than Mr. Trump. \u201cDonald Trump can say his path to victory runs through Pennsylvania, but we\u2019re going to fight him tooth and nail,\u201d said Preston Maddock, the state Democratic Party spokesman. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s drawing more white   votes, but his hateful message is also bringing out a lot of the same coalition that elected Obama. \u201d Delegates waved \u201cScranton\u201d signs on Wednesday night in Philadelphia as Mr. Biden spoke dismissively of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to tell us he cares about the middle class?\u201d Mr. Biden asked. \u201cGive me a break. \u201d In Scranton, Mr. Trump at times seemed to belittle his audience. Defending his call for NATO countries to pay more of the cost of the alliance, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re protecting countries that most of the people in this room have never heard of, and we\u2019ll end up in World War III. \u201d One of those in the audience, George Boyce, 70, said he was glad to have several more months to make up his mind. A retired Teamster, he said the book warehouse where he had worked left for Indiana because it could pay nonunion wages. But he was not convinced that the Democratic ticket would be better for union workers. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d he said. Mr. Joseph, the retired sales manager, said his son graduated from college with a chemical engineering degree but still faced difficulty finding work. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have one place to apply for a job around here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat broke my heart. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628550.0151315}
