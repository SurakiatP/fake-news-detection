[Ivey made these comments in a video he posted to Facebook in reaction to the horrendous attacks on unarmed,   Londoners. Looking at terror attacks around the world, Ivey observed:  Terrorists and active shooters are using every weapon available to target citizens. Guns, knives, trucks, hammers, and even explosives have all become the weapon of choice for murderers who only have one goal \u2014  killing innocent and   citizens. It seems that almost everyday we hear of another attack taking place at a concert, tourist destination, church, business, or anywhere else in the world where they can strike fear in the hearts of citizens. He urged Americans to take their safety seriously and to determine to be \u201cthe first line of defense\u201d against a terror attack.  He stressed, \u201cLet me be perfectly clear, doing nothing or just hoping it won\u2019t happen to you is not going to save your life. \u201d Ivey mentioned that officials in other parts of the world are teaching citizens that the best thing they can do is \u201crun, hide, tell,\u201d and he rejects that paradigm, citing the fact that \u201cthis is war\u201d and you win a war by fighting  \u2014   not by running. He points out that \u201cterrorists and active shooters know that our citizens have been coached to run and hide, and then patiently await help. \u201d He said attackers \u201ccount on\u201d Americans to respond this way, then added, \u201cWhat they don\u2019t count on is being attacked themselves. \u201d Ivey says it is time to be prepared to counterattack to be armed and ready to make the terrorists fight to defend their own lives for a change, should they strike.  Ivey said: No matter who you are or what your position is on guns, there is no denying the fact that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun \u2014  or a knife \u2014  is an armed and   citizen or law enforcement officer. There is no doubt that as soon as 911 is called law enforcement is on the way, however, until they arrive it is up to you and those with you to neutralize or eliminate the threat.
