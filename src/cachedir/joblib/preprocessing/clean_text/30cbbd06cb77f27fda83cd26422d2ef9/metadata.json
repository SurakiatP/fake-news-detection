[The   4 Plus vibrator, which allows users to customize their sexual experience with a variety of options via an app, was discovered to be secretly sending \u201cvast quantities of user data to  \u2019s parent company,\u201d while it was also revealed that the device could be hacked from a \u201cclose proximity. \u201d  \u201cFollowing a   lawsuit in an Illinois federal court,  \u2019s parent company Standard Innovation has been ordered to pay a total of C$4m [Canadian dollars] to owners, with those who used the vibrator\u2019s associated app entitled to the full amount each. Those who simply bought the vibrator can claim up to $199,\u201d reports The Guardian. \u201cThe app that controls the vibrator is barely secured, allowing anyone within Bluetooth range to seize control of the device. \u201d \u201cIn addition, data is collected and sent back to Standard Innovation, letting the company know about the temperature of the device and the vibration intensity  \u2014   which, combined, reveal intimate information about the user\u2019s sexual habits,\u201d they continued.
