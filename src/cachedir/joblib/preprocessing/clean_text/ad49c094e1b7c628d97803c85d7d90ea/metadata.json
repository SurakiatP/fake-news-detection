This year, Julia Roberts strode up the   steps for the premiere of Jodie Foster\u2019s \u201cMoney Monster\u201d and revealed that beneath her gown she was barefoot. The gesture seemed to capture the spirit of this year\u2019s festival, where women of substance were much in evidence. After years in which the festival was criticized for favoring male auteurs, this year three female directors have strong films in competition, including Maren Ade, a German whose poignant comedy \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d is seen as a likely contender for the top prize, the Palme d\u2019Or. (Jane Campion is the only woman to have won that award, in 1993, for \u201cThe Piano. \u201d) Besides Ms. Ade, the other women with films in competition are the British director Andrea Arnold, whose \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d a road movie starring Shia LaBeouf and the   actress Sasha Lane, has been receiving rave reviews (along with some pans) and the French   Nicole Garcia, whose \u201cFrom the Land of the Moon\u201d stars Marion Cotillard as a troubled,   Frenchwoman in the 1950s and has received mixed reviews. \u201cIt\u2019s great there are three women directors here, but there\u2019s still a lack of women making films,\u201d Ms. Arnold said after a news conference for \u201cAmerican Honey. \u201d Lizzie Francke, a senior production and development executive at the British Film Institute\u2019s Film Fund, echoed those sentiments. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that this year is a pretty good year,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I also still feel it\u2019s not good enough. \u201d She called Cannes \u201ca venerable old man\u2019s festival, but with a cutting edge. \u201d Even if Cannes\u2019s selection, like the film industry itself, hardly achieves gender parity, there\u2019s been more conversation this year about the challenges of getting more women behind the camera and in front of it, an issue that has heated up since the American Civil Liberties Union last year called for an investigation into gender discrimination in Hollywood hiring practices. At an event where the luxury consortium Kering gave an award to Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis 25 years after the release of \u201cThelma and Louise,\u201d Pierre Lescure, president of the festival, said that maybe in a few years there would be a woman in his place and in the place of Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the festival\u2019s director. The audience applauded. \u201cI think more and more women starting production companies\u201d would help, Ms. Sarandon said, adding: \u201cHollywood isn\u2019t political one way or another  \u2014   that\u2019s the good news and the bad news. They just go with the money. \u201d Ms. Davis, who founded the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, recalled how after \u201cThelma and Louise\u201d came out in 1991, the film was hailed as groundbreaking there were suggestions it might lead to more films   women. That hasn\u2019t entirely happened. \u201cI think we have to stop saying, \u2018Now this will change everything,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t measure the change, it hasn\u2019t happened. \u201d Ms. Davis said that she advised studios and TV networks to \u201cMake what you\u2019re already going to make,\u201d but \u201cbefore you cast it, just go through and change a bunch of names to female. \u201d Ms. Foster, whose \u201cMoney Monster\u201d (playing out of competition) is her fourth feature as a director, said that the technological changes of recent years, like the advent of streaming services, had made studio executives and producers far more  . That, she said, led them to tend to take big bets on projects they hope will draw huge audiences rather than investing in smaller films by unknown directors, including women. Before investing millions of dollars, \u201cyou\u2019re going to go with the guy who looks like you,\u201d Ms. Foster said at a Kering Women in Motion talk. She said that many scripts written by and for women were just not being produced. \u201cIt\u2019s a financial issue, it\u2019s where art and commerce come together and commerce is winning,\u201d she said. \u201cIt used to be that the investment was not as large, so the risk was not as large. \u201d This week at Cannes, We Do It Together, a nonprofit film company started last year by Juliette Binoche and others aimed at making work by women for film and television, announced its first project: \u201cTogether Now,\u201d a film of seven short episodes by different directors, including Robin Wright and Catherine Hardwicke, and starring Freida Pinto and Ms. Binoche, among others. At this year\u2019s festival, even the starlets seem to have more edge. Kristen Stewart, called \u201cthe queen of Cannes\u201d by Mr. Fr\u00e9maux because she is starring in two films here, changed into a miniskirt and sneakers for the dinner following the   film last week, Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society,\u201d in which she plays against the girlish confines of her role. At a news conference, Mr. Allen said he had chosen Ms. Stewart, whose character is caught between those played by Steve Carell and Jesse Eisenberg, because \u201cI needed someone who could play an adorable little secretary from Nebraska with little white socks on and little dresses,\u201d but who could also transform into \u201ca sophisticated beauty in cosmopolitan Manhattan. \u201d Ms. Stewart, whose range far exceeds adorable, elaborated on Mr. Allen\u2019s description. \u201cThe way he describes this lightness and this feminine nature, it does suggest that it\u2019s a little thoughtless,\u201d she said at a lunch with the news media. \u201cI think he has a tendency in interviews to say, \u2018It was an idea and I had the idea and I wrote the idea and I hired the girl and she did it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Stewart added, imitating Mr. Allen\u2019s cadences. \u201cBut there\u2019s more going on,\u201d she said. (Ms. Stewart also stars in \u201cPersonal Shopper,\u201d by the French director Olivier Assayas, which screens in the competition here on Tuesday.) Vanessa Redgrave said that she didn\u2019t envy young women starting out today. \u201cI feel very respectful of them and tender toward them,\u201d Ms. Redgrave said at an event to promote a newly restored version of \u201cHowards End,\u201d the 1992 Merchant and Ivory film set in the early 20th century in which her character doesn\u2019t think women should be allowed to vote. \u201cIt\u2019s like a voracious sort of market,\u201d Ms. Redgrave added of the fame machine. \u201cIt\u2019s grotesque. \u201d Carrie Fisher, who grew up in the public eye, said she still found it difficult that women in Hollywood are judged by their looks far more than men are. She was at Cannes for the premiere of \u201cBright Lights,\u201d a documentary about her and her mother, Debbie Reynolds, directed by Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens. \u201cSomeone wrote a review that both my mother and I look exhausted,\u201d Ms. Fisher said over tea while her dog sat in the next chair. \u201cAnd they can say that. They are at liberty to say that,\u201d she added. \u201cIn L. A. you\u2019ll find more people saying, \u2018You look great,\u2019 not \u2018You seem great,\u2019 \u2018How are you?\u2019 \u2018What are you doing? \u2019\u201d The only women on most sets are still mainly actresses and hairdressers, she said, adding that that was also the case for the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, which she is now shooting. \u201cI\u2019m a female in it,\u201d Ms. Fisher said just one notch up from deadpan, of her role as General Leia. \u201cAn exhausted female. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562623.9376287}
