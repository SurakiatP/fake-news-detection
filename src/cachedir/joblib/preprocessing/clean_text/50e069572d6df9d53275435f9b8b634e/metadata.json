[The Mail on Sunday newspaper posted undercover footage, taken in a covert sting operation,  of  the embassy employee telling a reporter from   that \u201cI want to take down  \u2026     the Deputy Foreign Minister\u201d (Sir Alan Duncan)   \u2014   a   critic of Israel, and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u2019s   .  Duncan was \u201cdoing a lot of problems,\u201d he added, before calling foreign office chief Johnson an \u201cidiot\u201d and mocking \u201ccrazy\u201d opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his \u201cweirdo\u201d supporters. The embassy apologized for the smears, saying it \u201crejects the remarks concerning Minister Duncan, which are completely unacceptable\u201d. \u201cThe comments were made by a junior embassy employee who is not an Israeli diplomat, and who will be ending his term of employment with the embassy shortly,\u201d it added. Ambassador Mark Regev (pictured) apologised personally to Duncan on Friday, according to the embassy. Britain\u2019s Foreign Office confirmed they had received an apology, and that it now considered \u201cthe matter closed\u201d. \u201cThe Israeli Ambassador has apologised and is clear these comments do not reflect the views of the Embassy or Government of Israel,\u201d a spokesperson told The Independent. \u201cThe UK has a strong relationship with Israel and we consider the matter closed. \u201d The Guardian reported that the footage was part of a wider project recording conversations with Israeli embassy staff, British politicians and   supporters, which is set to air in documentaries that   will broadcast from January 15.
