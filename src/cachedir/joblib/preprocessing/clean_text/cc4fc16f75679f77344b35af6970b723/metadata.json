The rumored second round of layoffs at Twitter \u2013 which in 2011 was granted by the befuddled city of San Francisco the \u201cTwitter tax break\u201d on employment taxes \u2013 comes at a very inopportune moment for the glory of commercial real estate. These layoffs would amount to 8% to Twitter\u2019s workforce, or about 300 people, according to Bloomberg.Already, Twitter has thrown 183,642 square feet of vacant office space at its two-building Mid-Market headquarters on the sublease market, thus bringing it to 1.51 million square feet (msf).This comes at a time when, according to the \u201csnapshot\u201d from Cushman & Wakefield, leasing activity nearly ground to a halt in the third quarter, with only 875,000 sf leased \u2013 the lowest since 2001!There was only one major lease deal over 100,000 sf: Amazon\u2019s live streaming video platform Twitch, which took 178,000 sf. The next largest deal was less than half that size: WeWork leased 78,000 sf.Leasing activity for the three quarters this year plunged 30% from the same period last year, to just 4.7 msf, according to a report released this week by commercial real estate services firm Savills Studley, which added dryly, \u201cThe competition for space has calmed dramatically from several quarters ago.\u201dAnd there is a lot of new supply coming on the market, according to Cushman & Wakefield: currently, 3.8 msf of office space are under construction, with 31% preleased.Overall vacancy rose 0.7 percentage points from the prior quarter to 9.0% in Q3, according to Savills Studley. In Class A buildings, availability jumped 1.1 percentage points to 10.4%. Some areas were still red-hot, but others are turning cold: In the SOMA area, there were practically no vacancies (1.0%).
