The victim\u2019s mother, her life suddenly a disordered jumble marked by panic attacks and nightmares, decided to seek out her son\u2019s killer to try to understand what had prompted an act of violence so baffling that even the gunman was at a loss.  With the aid of a restorative justice program, which brings together victims and those who have caused them harm, the two ultimately met  \u2014   each seeking a way out of grief, fear and guilt. Here\u2019s a look at Timothy, Joshua and Joshua\u2019s mother as she becomes involved in the program. (In this related article, read about a meeting between the parents of a college student and the man convicted in the   accident that killed their son.) \u201cI probably broke my mom\u2019s heart when I told her that,\u201d Timothy, now 30, said. \u201cThe road I was leading, I knew I was going to end up in one of those two places. \u201d At 14, Timothy and some other boys robbed a pawnshop, and he spent two years in a juvenile facility. By age 16, he was \u201creligiously\u201d carrying a gun that he sometimes used. He did not elaborate. \u201cHanging out with a group of kids gave me hope,\u201d said Timothy, who was tormented by his adoption, and the parents he never knew. \u201cI didn\u2019t think my biological mother loved me. \u201d At the time of the shooting, Timothy was working at a telemarketing center. He spent his free hours smoking pot and drinking at least a pint of Hennessy a day. He customized the black 2005 Nissan Altima with special wheel rims, and was methodical about keeping the car looking pristine. Joshua grew up in Topeka with his mother, Judi Bergquist, and was especially close to his older brother. He liked to play practical jokes on those close to him. \u201cHe was so funny,\u201d his mother said. He had severe attention deficit disorder and graduated from an alternative high school. Problems with social anxiety prompted him to wear a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap pulled low over his face. Ms. Bergquist said Joshua began hanging out with what she described as a \u201crougher\u201d group of friends after graduating, so she sent him to Texas to live with her parents. He returned to Topeka about two years later and found work at a   service. But persistent money problems forced him to rely on his mother and grandmother. \u201cThe day he died, he called me in the late afternoon,\u201d Ms. Bergquist said. \u201cHe was extremely upset because my mom had shut off his cellphone and he had a car payment to make. \u201d He\u2019d screamed at her. A few hours later, she said Joshua drove slowly by her house but didn\u2019t stop. It was the last time she saw him alive. Hours later, Timothy and Joshua met for the first time through a mutual friend. The two seemed to hit it off. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come off as a person I couldn\u2019t get along with. I was easy to get along with,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cI rode around with Josh in his car. \u201d But as the night of April 23, 2007, wore on, their easy conversation deteriorated into bickering, and the two argued loudly while drinking at a bar. \u201cHe said something about one of my friends, so I said something about one of his friends,\u201d said Timothy, who called someone to pick him up. \u201cWe were going out the door at the same time, still arguing. I actually opened his car door and then I walk off. I just told him to get in the car. That\u2019s when me and his friend, we\u2019re arguing now . .. All I see was him pull out a weapon . .. I thought he had a gun. \u201d He fired eight times, and a friend of Timothy\u2019s fired twice more before they fled, the police said. Joshua was left in the parking lot with four gunshot wounds in the chest, one in the left hip, two in the buttocks and three in the left hand. \u201cMy   was it was better him than me,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in fighting. I just pulled out my gun. I actually ran up to him when I shot him. I don\u2019t blame alcohol. I knew what I was doing. I just saw something in his hand. \u201d Joshua was unarmed, police said Timothy\u2019s accomplice was never arrested. During pretrial hearings, Timothy would see Ms. Bergquist in the courtroom, and at one court appearance, he taunted her. \u201cI actually took her son\u2019s photo, and held it up and turned around, and that\u2019s when I laughed at her,\u201d he said. Ms. Bergquist, suffering from memory loss and insomnia, panicked every time she saw a tall   man  \u2014   the loose description of Timothy\u2019s accomplice. \u201cIf I saw anybody with that vague description, I would just lose it,\u201d she said. Finally, wanting to avoid a trial, Ms. Bergquist agreed to a plea deal in which Timothy would receive about 20 years. Timothy was impassive: \u201cI didn\u2019t care about life. \u201d \u201cI knew that Timothy held the answers that I needed. I needed reassurance from Timothy that the other person was never going to bother me,\u201d said Ms. Bergquist. \u201cI needed to feel safe. At the same time, I needed to know if Timothy was working to change his life. I didn\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else. \u201d The first step toward a meeting came after a prison official showed Timothy an article that Ms. Bergquist had written about Joshua. Ms. Bergquist also contacted Holly Chavez, the restorative justice coordinator at the Kansas Department of Corrections, and asked whether a    meeting would be possible. Timothy was also growing more introspective. He was reading the Bible as well as a book that included a passage that seemed written for him: \u201cIf you always do what you always did, you always get what you always got. \u201d The solitude of prison forced him to try to figure out who he was. \u201cI had a lot of time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got to deal with a lot of stuff on your own. It made me go back and look at the things in my life. I became Christian. I understood forgiveness  \u2014   that I took a life that I can never give back. \u201d What follows is a discussion of the reactions of Timothy and Ms. Bergquist as they worked with Ms. Chavez toward a    encounter. The excerpts, which are from separate interviews that took place after the meeting, capture the thinking of those involved.
