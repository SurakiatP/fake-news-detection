[\u201cYou heard me saying \u201coops\u201d as my pencil fell, and you then took a break from writing your notes to help me pick it up. I said \u201cthank you\u201d with a smile you smiled back and said \u201cno problem,\u201d Villanova student Valeria Alvarado began. \u201cWhen I was absent from class because I was sick, you let me look at your notes so I could catch up. You have even held the door open for me when we both walked out of the building together. I really appreciate the times you have helped me out when I needed it. \u201d  Alvarado\u2019s column, \u201cTo the Racist Guy Who Picked Up my Pencil,\u201d builds up to the thesis that polite acts do not excuse an individual\u2019s underlying racism, which she claims could be seen in Facebook posts that her peer had made such as those that read \u201cbuilding the wall,\u201d \u201c#AllLivesMatter,\u201d and \u201cwe cannot tell which refugees are terrorists. \u201d \u201cThis open letter goes out to every racist person who has ever picked up my dropped pencil said \u201cbless you\u201d after I sneezed stopped to ask me how my Christmas break was, has written \u201chappy birthday\u201d on my Facebook wall, has said \u201cgood morning\u201d to me as we walk past each other on campus, or has asked me where I got my \u201ccute shirt\u201d from,\u201d she continues. \u201cNo smile, compliment, or favor will erase the fact that I know you do not actually want my family and me in this country. \u201d Comments on the column were quick to point out that those that are against illegal immigration oppose the illegal entry of persons of all ethnic backgrounds. \u201cLeftist (sic) often get criticized for an alleged \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree with my views, you\u2019re just a bigot\u201d attitude, and this piece functions as an interesting case study in that mentality,\u201d one commenter said. Another argued that if the author\u2019s attitude was applied to other laws, it would seem absurd: \u201cIf I call for harsh penalties for tax fraud, it\u2019s not personal. Learning that you cheat on your taxes doesn\u2019t change my opinion about tax law  \u2014   it changes my opinion about YOU. I can still be your friend, but I\u2019ll think a little less of you. \u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.
