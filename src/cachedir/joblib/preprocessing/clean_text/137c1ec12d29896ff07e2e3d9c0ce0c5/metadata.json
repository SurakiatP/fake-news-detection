[762 murders were committed in Chicago in 2016, and 2017 isn\u2019t looking any better. President Trump tweeted that the violence is \u201ctotally out of control,\u201d exclaiming, \u201cChicago needs help!\u201d following the shooting deaths of seven people in one day in February.  Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there  \u2014   totally out of control. Chicago needs help!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2017,  The developers at Culture Shock Games are trying to do their part to help with We Are Chicago, what they hope is an affecting interactive walk in the shoes of fictional Chicago youth Aaron Davis. Aaron is a high school senior with a younger sister and a single mom. He is also a citizen of Chicago\u2019s dangerous streets, and his journey asks the player to navigate a world in which deadly violence is a daily reality. Whether it is the sound of gunfire at dinner or Aaron\u2019s friend holding up the fast food joint where he works, players are confronted with uncomfortably realistic scenarios that represent snapshots from the lives of real people. Based on interviews with residents, We Are Chicago draws its inspiration from the reality of life in the Windy City. Aaron struggles to avoid the influence of gangs  \u2014   a support structure that tempts many desperate urban youths with the promise of security, community, and income when jobs are scarce  \u2014   while navigating family life and the demands of school. The game released in February, but it has had a rough go on the Steam marketplace. Despite its   mission, players have noted a host of technical issues that detract from the experience  \u2014   or even make it outright unplayable. It also isn\u2019t very long  \u2014   about the length of a single chapter in the Telltale adventure games, whose influence We Are Chicago wears on its sleeve.
