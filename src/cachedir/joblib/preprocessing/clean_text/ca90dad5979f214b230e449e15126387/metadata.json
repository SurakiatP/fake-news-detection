What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Voting begins in a few hours in the United States. Polls show a tight race nationally and in swing states, though early voting data bodes well for Hillary Clinton. We boarded Donald J. Trump\u2019s plane for an inside look at his last stand. He\u2019s betting big on less educated white voters. And even if he loses, his campaign\u2019s legacy will live on, in the form of emboldened extremists. Here\u2019s our live coverage of the last hours of the race. We\u2019re offering unlimited access to NYTimes. com for the election, from now through Thursday morning. _____ \u2022 Hong Kong is bracing for street protests and tough questions about the independence of its courts after China barred two   city politicians from taking their seats in the legislature. The move could open an era in which Hong Kong\u2019s elected officials can be punished if they fail to meet a vague standard of political loyalty to the central government. _____ \u2022 China\u2019s new cybersecurity law gives the authorities far greater control over the internet as of next summer. Its requirements  \u2014   including real names for messaging services and security checks in the finance and communication industries  \u2014   are raising concerns about freedom of speech and barriers to foreign businesses. _____ \u2022 Australia will not legalize   marriage anytime soon. A bill that would have allowed for a plebiscite on the issue was shot down in Parliament over the $140 million cost and concerns that it would become a platform for hate speech. Polls show around 70 percent of Australians want marriage equality, and many supporters of legalization want action in Parliament, not a nonbinding plebiscite. _____ \u2022 Heavy smog continues to choke New Delhi, where schools are closed and emergency measures are in place to improve air quality that is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. Asked where she lived, a New Delhi resident said, \u201ca gas chamber. \u201d _____ \u2022 The Philippine Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether President Rodrigo Duterte may transfer the remains of Ferdinand E. Marcos, the country\u2019s former dictator, to a heroes\u2019 cemetery in Manila. The justices have another Duterte case on the docket: a senator who has often been critical of him has asked the court for an order to stop him from retaliating with verbal attacks, which have included speeches in which he called her a \u201cdirty woman\u201d and discussed her private life. \u2022 Warner Bros. a division of Time Warner, is often in the shadow of its sibling HBO. Kevin Tsujihara, above right, the film studio\u2019s chief executive, wants to change all that. He is on pace to deliver record operating profit and may have a hit with the new J. K. Rowling film, \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. \u201d \u2022 China will release its balance of trade figures  \u2014   how its exports and imports compare  \u2014   for October, offering another data point for the health of the country\u2019s economy. \u2022 The Sotheby\u2019s auction house reported a loss of $54 million in the third quarter, citing a slowdown in the art market and the purchase of an advisory business. \u2022 U. S. markets surged on election news, and the dollar was up. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 The Nicaraguan president, Daniel Ortega, was   to a third term in an election that many disaffected voters simply ignored. [The Wall Street Journal] \u2022 A German sailing couple, who were seized and held for ransom eight years ago by Somali pirates, were reported to have been abducted again in dangerous waters near the Philippines. [The New York Times] \u2022 Japanese government investigators raided the offices of a national advertising giant, Dentsu, after the death of a young woman it employed was attributed to overwork. [The Asahi Shimbun] \u2022 China\u2019s   a sleek   fighter, demonstrates the country\u2019s growing power as a military force and an arms maker. [Foreign Policy] \u2022 The scandal engulfing South Korea\u2019s presidency was uncovered because of a card game in Macau. [The Washington Post] \u2022 Mikheil Saakashvili, a former president of Georgia, quit his post in Ukraine\u2019s government and accused the Ukrainian president of blocking efforts to fight corruption. [The New York Times] \u2022 The British prime minister, Theresa May, offered improved visa arrangements to India in trade talks meant to bolster ties ahead of the \u201cBrexit. \u201d [The New York Times] \u2022 Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as U. S. attorney general, died at age 78. She played a major role in some of the most divisive episodes of the presidency of Bill Clinton. \u2022 The world\u2019s youngest chess grandmaster,    Sergey Karjakin of Russia, is about to challenge the reigning world champion in New York. \u2022 A new study finds that whale songs need to be felt as well as heard. The sounds are accompanied by vibrations that course hundreds if not thousands of feet through the water, possibly enhancing    communication. \u2022 A Chinese Paralympic champion was nowhere to be seen at the finish of the New York City Marathon. Turned out her wheelchair had blown a tire at Mile 13  \u2014   so three people, aided by a translation app, stepped in to help. \u201cIt really was a cool New York moment,\u201d one said. Britons have been saying a lot of goodbyes in the past few months. They voted to leave the European Union. The prime minister resigned. The leading figures of the \u201cBrexit\u201d campaign departed the government. And through all this, the news media outside Britain found one expression that worked in multiple languages: \u201cEnglish leave. \u201d It\u2019s a play on \u201ctaking French leave,\u201d which the British use to mean departing abruptly  \u2014   supposedly a reference to the French manner of leaving a social function without saying goodbye. Such nationalist expressions abounded around the 19th century, when rival nations in a disunited Europe settled scores in wars, revolutions and slights. But the Germans also pick on the Poles for evaporating from parties, which the British call an \u201cIrish goodbye. \u201d (The German weekly \u201cDie Zeit\u201d even graphed the zingers and  .) Of course, the slaps don\u2019t end with departures. Germans can mention, though rarely, \u201cEnglish shopping\u201d  \u2014   that is, theft, as in the colonial past. And references to historic battles get drawn into the mix, too. So the French could say, depending on how Brexit works out, \u201cc\u2019est un vrai coup de Trafalgar,\u201d a true Trafalgar blow, reminiscent of their decisive defeat by the English in 1805.
