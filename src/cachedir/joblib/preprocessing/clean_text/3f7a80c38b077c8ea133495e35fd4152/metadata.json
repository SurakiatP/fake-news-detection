[In a post on Medium, Tribune deputy editor Kurt Gessler revealed that the paper had seen a rapid decline in its median Facebook organic post reach after November, with the number of articles being read by fewer than 10, 000 readers \u201cskyrocketing,\u201d according to Gessler\u2019s analysis of the data.   (Via Kurt  . com) Facebook did change its algorithms around the same time the Tribune\u2019s median traffic began to drop. In January, Facebook\u2019s \u201ctrending news\u201d feature was changed from its previous model, which tailored results to the personal preferences and interests of users, to one which surfaced news based on geographical region. According to reports, the change was introduced to favor   \u201creal news\u201d over \u201cfake news. \u201d The Chicago Tribune, of course, is one of the most influential and respected mainstream papers in the U. S. and clearly considered itself a part of the mainstream media\u2019s fight against \u201cfake news,\u201d which reached a height in the weeks and months immediately following Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cWe are going to point out fake news when we see it,\u201d The Tribune\u2019s Facebook account posted in late December. In January, Facebook also changed the algorithm of its users\u2019 news feeds, again with a focus on finding \u201creal news. \u201d According to Facebook, the new algorithm would \u201cincorporat[e] new signals to better identify and rank authentic content. \u201d The algorithm is also intended to surface \u201ctimely\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d content. This is what Gissler  \u2014   who does not believe a paper as mainstream and respectable and established as the Chicago Tribune could ever be accused of peddling fake news, much less admitting to it and correcting themselves afterwards  \u2014   believes is hurting his paper. Given that I hope the Tribune passes muster for \u201cauthentic,\u201d let\u2019s focus on the second half. What exact signals are being used to determine what \u201ctimely\u201d means? It purports to favor topics that are being discussed in real time. In addition to rejecting the idea that the Chicago Tribune might not always publish authentic content, Gissler also fails to consider that the   of the paper\u2019s drop in traffic is also right after the general election. While some news sites have avoided a   slump, others, like Slate and Politico, saw traffic declines of 40 percent or more after the election. The legacy news industry is increasingly troubled by the power of Facebook and Google, which together are extending their dominant position in digital advertising. The British press industry publication Press Gazette recently launched a campaign against the   \u201cduopoly\u201d of Google and Facebook, urging them to cut old media in on their ad revenue, as well as do more to tackle \u201cfake news. \u201d If Gissler\u2019s suspicions are correct, however, tackling \u201cfake news\u201d might not get legacy media the results they wanted.
