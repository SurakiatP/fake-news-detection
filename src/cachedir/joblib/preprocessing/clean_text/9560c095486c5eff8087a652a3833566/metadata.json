Texas, the blood-red, deeply conservative bastion of all things far right, is a statistical dead heat between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\" http://thedailybanter.com/2016/10/texas-swing-state/ Just search \"Texas Swing State\" for lots of articles on this. The one above shows Clinton at 46% and Trump at 45%. I call BS. There is no way, no way in hell, that Bill Clinton\\'s wife and a pig in her own right is within single digits of Donald Trump in Texas. But that doesn\\'t mean that there won\\'t be an attempt to steal the state\\'s electoral votes. I knew a couple of months ago, when elitist mouthpiece Rush Limbaugh said it was a \"one-point race in Texas,\" that we were being psychologically prepped for the flipping of the state from Republican to Democrat.It could be that we\\'re about to see a sleight-of-hand trick on election night. While all attention is fixed on Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and the other swing states, lo and behold, Hillary won Texas!Awarding her the state would have two benefits. First, she\\'d get our 38 electoral votes, second, any \"secession\" talk would be scrapped. How could we justify secession, since we voted for Hillary?Anyway, we\\'re watching you, DNC. Keep your hands off our electoral votes. Logged'"}, "time": 1742563356.0240107}
