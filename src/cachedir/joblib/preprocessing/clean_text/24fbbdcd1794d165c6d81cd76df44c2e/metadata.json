[Poynter\u2019s Chief Media Writer James Warren was reporting on a study concluding that while \u201cfake news\u201d stories favoring Donald Trump far surpassed those in favor of Hillary Clinton, such stories didn\u2019t significantly affect the outcome of the election. \u201cDid fake news help elect Trump? Not likely, according to new research,\u201d was the title of the Poynter article.  In response to the study, Warren concluded: The paper is worth consideration especially given overriding press assumptions about the potency of ideologically driven news coverage. The study, titled, \u201cSocial Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election,\u201d was   by economists Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University and Hunt Allcott of New York University.  The paper utilized web browsing data, a database of   fake news stories, and a   online survey about news trends. Warren reported on the survey results: In sum, they conclude that the role of social media was overstated, with television remaining by far the primary vehicle for consuming political news. Just 14 percent of Americans deemed social media the primary source of their campaign news, according to their research. In addition, while fake news that favored Trump far exceeded that favoring Clinton, few Americans actually recalled the specifics of the stories and fewer believed them. \u201cFor fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake article would need to have had the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads,\u201d they conclude. Poynter further quoted from the survey itself: \u201cIn summary, our data suggest that social media were not the most important source of election news, and even the most widely circulated fake news stories were seen by only a small fraction of Americans. For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake news story would need to have convinced about 0. 7 percent of Clinton voters and   who saw it to shift their votes to Trump, a persuasion rate equivalent to seeing 36 television campaign ads. \u201d Poynter\u2019s reportage on the matter is particularly significant since the journalism nonprofit has partnered with Facebook with the specific goal of combatting \u201cfake news. \u201d  This after numerous politicians and pundits have claimed that alleged fake news helped sway the election. The International   Network (IFCN) which is a project of the Poynter Institute, drafted a code of five principles for news websites to accept, and Facebook last month explained it will work with \u201c    organizations\u201d that are signatories to the code of principles. Facebook says that if the \u201cfact checking organizations\u201d determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, \u201cthere will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
