Herniated disks, spinal stenosis, bone spurs: It\u2019s a mess in there. As for the shoulders, one gave out with a horrible popping noise in a yoga class a few years ago the cause of the other\u2019s decay remains a (very dull) mystery. These were the afflictions that sent me pillow shopping last week, and for which, on one particularly frigid evening, Saroya   a sales associate at Hastens, the Swedish mattress company, prescribed what she called \u201ca   pillow cocktail. \u201d Ms.   whose nickname is Soy, was not referring to the handful of Advil washed down with a Bud that would be my   palliative. It\u2019s the relationship, she said, between my head, my bed and my pillow. I had come to Hastens first because it is the purveyor of the $100, 000 mattress, an artisanal object made from wool, horsetail hair, cotton and mohair. (Like condo sales topping $100 million, this number sets a benchmark for a certain kind of lunatic luxury purchase.) And I knew I would find a pillow there to elevate the whole category. For years, the standard pillow for those with neck issues has been a crudely formed foam number, which is about as sexy as the cervical collar that is its daytime mate. Orthopedic bedding is not a style you want to cleave to, at least not for any length of time. You can\u2019t mask an orthopedic pillow in a   print from John Robshaw, and its    contours throw the armada of the \u201cdressed bed\u201d into disarray. Hastens Anatomical Pillow is an unlovely name for a pretty object. At least, it comes with a case made from the company\u2019s signature    check. It is made of down and feathers, and shaped like a padded O, or a Leigh Bowery headdress (yes, I did stuff my head into it later). Inside the O is a pocket into which you slip a neck bolster, made from the same proportion  \u2014   15 to 85 percent  \u2014   of down to feathers. For side or back sleepers like me, the   of the pillow is designed to fit under your neck and support its natural curve. Ms.   had me unwrap myself from all my layers so she could see my neck, and led me gently to what she said was Hastens\u2019s best seller, the 2000T ($38, 000). \u201cThis is a   bed,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s really great for side sleepers. \u201d Tucking the pillow under my head, she traced my spine from   to my hairline with her fingers to make sure it was straight. My shoulders unscrunched, my eyelids fluttered. Reader, I went home with a $330 pillow. \u2022 These are boom times for the luxury bedding business. Hastens has been expanding exponentially, having opened two new stores in Manhattan last year now there are four locations in the city where you can buy a mattress that costs more than your car, and another Hastens store is to open in two weeks in Greenwich, Conn. But entire fortunes are being made in pillows, too. Consider the success of the My Pillow founder, Michael J. Lindell, a   former cocaine addict and inventor whose    pillows, which sell for about $50, brought in more than $100 million in sales in 2012, according to The Star Tribune of Minneapolis. No doubt you\u2019ve seen his infomercial. He, too, had neck issues. He, like you, would \u201c  all night long like a guppy,\u201d as he puts it, until he developed his patented pillow filler, a stew of interlocking foam chunks.\u2019 \u201dThere are a few data sets to roughly gauge the size of the market for a product that would address the   nexus. In 2012, according to a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, and made available by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons last week, 14 percent of adult Americans said they had neck pain within a   period in 2010, another N. C. H. S. survey noted that there were more than 10 million visits to doctors\u2019 offices for complaints related to neck pain.\u201d \u2019As it turns out, said Dr. Robert Gotlin, director of orthopedic and sports rehabilitation at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, we are designed for failure. \u201cThe fact is, from age 25 on, this process of failure begins,\u201d he continued cheerfully. \u201cThe analogy is this: You go to a bowling alley and you hold a bowling ball over your head, and what happens is your arms gets tired. Basically, your head is that   ball. And over time, two things happen: your muscles get sore and your disks wear out. Or you get arthritis. We\u2019re all going to wind up with at least one of these conditions at the same time we are still holding up this   object. I, like you, would love to go to bed and wake up without feeling any pain. \u201d As far as pillows are concerned, he said: \u201cThe real answer is, there is no answer. Foam or any of these pillows with the divots, the cutout supports, these are marketing items that have their own research attached that supports their claims. The best advice is to just pick one that feels good. The pillow should basically be one that keeps your head over your shoulders. Rather than spend all this money on the fancy things, see what\u2019s comfortable. That could be the cheapest one. \u201d \u2022 At the Clean Bedroom in Brooklyn Heights, which sells organic bedding (natural latex and     cotton sheets, for example, in beige tones) and   bedroom furniture like dressers made from sustainable maple from the parlor floor of a brownstone building, Luis Camejo was explaining the niceties of   pillows. He was trying to locate a   one for me. Grains are good for support, he said, and because millet is a smaller grain than buckwheat, it\u2019s less noisy  \u2014   less crunchy  \u2014   if you move around when you sleep. But he was sold out of the millet, and so were his company\u2019s six other stores. It turned out that the seamstress at Sachi Organics, which makes the pillows, had a pinched nerve and was a week behind on their orders. Now that\u2019s kind of ironic. \u201cI\u2019m an English major,\u201d Mr. Camejo said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure of the correct meaning of irony. \u201d How does an English major get into the bedding business? \u201cCraigslist,\u201d he said, as he rang up a buckwheat pillow ($80) and a shredded organic rubber contour pillow covered in beige wool ($199). \u2022   on Mercer Street, directly opposite Andre Balazs\u2019s solemn, Jean   glass castle, is a Greek organic bedding store that sells mattresses made from layers of coconut fibers, seaweed, cotton, wool and natural rubber. You could probably eat them, if times were tough. The main precept here is a sort of D. I. Y. bed: mattresses and pillows are made from zippered pockets stuffed with plant materials you can add to or remove. I was put to bed with slippers, a glass of   orange juice and a hand towel that Alisha Hylton, director of sales for   North America, spread over the Sithon VIII pillow (names here are derived from Greek mythology).   makes 12 kinds of pillows in various architectural styles and fillings, and a computer program on an iPad helps you figure out the one for you. Ms. Hylton said she used to measure her customers\u2019 necks and shoulder spans with a ruler until a small child broke it now she just eyeballs them. The Sithon VIII ($316) had a bolster and a central pouch filled with seaweed, rubber and eucalyptus leaves. It comes with a bottle of eucalyptus oil and squares of linen you dollop with oil, then stick in that central pouch. I wasn\u2019t eager to sleep in a fog of eucalyptus  \u2014   it was too medical an aroma for bed  \u2014   so Ms. Hylton added another, plainer model, the Sithon I ($117). None of the bedding is returnable, but in Europe you can try  \u2019s beds and pillows free, said Mike Efmorfidis, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, at a   stay at one of their hotels. \u201cI can\u2019t offer you that here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can sign up to sleep in the suite downstairs. Though not right now, because it\u2019s occupied. \u201d Someone is sleeping under us right now? \u201cAh, he\u2019s up now, he just passed by,\u201d Mr. Efmorfidis said. Siestas in the suite, Ms. Hylton added, come complete with pillows and fresh linens. Customers typically choose   or   sessions, she said. It is perhaps a sign of the times that you can now find a bed by the hour, and just sleep in it.'"}, "time": 1742562301.7199907}
