He handed her a small folded piece of paper and waited as Ms. Parker read it. \u201cAw,\u201d she said, and smiled. \u201cThank you! Thank you, Michael!\u201d On \u201cSex and the City,\u201d Ms. Parker famously played Carrie Bradshaw, an    serially dating and hotly pursuing ideal love. Perhaps because of that, Michael took the opportunity to launch into tales of his own love life,    : the girlfriend who recently dumped him, the new girl who might really be something. \u201cYou\u2019re cute as a button,\u201d his note read. In spite of Ms. Parker\u2019s age (51) her 19 years of marriage to Matthew Broderick, and her three children, her public image remains closely bound up with that of Carrie, a symbol of youthful possibility, forever available, forever adorable. On Oct. 9, 12 years after the series went off the air, Ms. Parker is returning to HBO with a show whose very title  \u2014   \u201cDivorce\u201d  \u2014   suggests the bitter culmination of all that sex in the city. She plays Frances, a kind of   someone long married, living (brace yourself) in the suburbs, and working as a corporate recruiter, her arty dreams subsumed by financial necessity. Her husband  \u2014   though not for much longer  \u2014   is Robert (Thomas Haden Church) a real estate entrepreneur down on his luck. Frances is far from a   romantic: She has cheated on her husband she is a narcissistic oversharer, a   accuser, a   manipulator. She is also, as played by Ms. Parker, deeply real and somehow appealing. \u201cI\u2019m still getting to know her,\u201d Ms. Parker said. She was quick to clarify that she is no more Frances than she ever was Carrie (she and Mr. Broderick married about a week before she shot the pilot). But \u201cDivorce,\u201d at turns moody and comic, does cover material that is meaningful to Ms. Parker, who is an executive producer of the series. For some years, she has wanted to do a show about   relationships, a natural outgrowth, she said, of countless conversations she has had with friends who, like her, are in early middle age, a time when it\u2019s common for people to grapple with the choices they have made, in relationships as much as anything else. The show reflects, she said, a \u201ccertain introspection and reckoning\u201d that is inevitable after some 15 or 20 years of marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s a really specific point in a person\u2019s life, right now, for my generation,\u201d said Ms. Parker. \u201cIt\u2019s when you start to think about relationships, the time spent, what came of it  \u2014   and what do you do with where you find yourself now?\u201d AFTER \u201cSEX AND THE CITY,\u201d Ms. Parker did not look very hard for her next big role when people asked about another television series, \u201cI used to say never,\u201d she told Alec Baldwin on his podcast, \u201cHere\u2019s the Thing. \u201d The schedule is demanding for someone raising three children (her twins, Marion and Tabitha, are now 7, and her son, James Wilkie, is 13) and she never found a show that intrigued her enough to make the family sacrifice worthwhile. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at a point in your life where you can make choices, you can make a choice to say no,\u201d she said. \u201dIt\u2019s kind of nice. \u201d She made two \u201cSex and the City\u201d movies, to decidedly mixed reviews, and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role in \u201cThe Family Stone. \u201d Following that, one of her movies had critical success but small audiences (\u201cSmart People,\u201d 2008) while others had less favorable reviews and even smaller audiences (see \u201cSpinning Into Butter,\u201d 2007). Her reputation as a beloved star never flagged, but neither did she ever land on a role so strong that it put Carrie to bed for good. \u201cIt is hard to find material you really love, particularly when you\u2019ve been so successful,\u201d Mr. Broderick said. \u201cIt feels like a lot of pressure. \u201d Ms. Parker spent much of her energy in recent years leveraging her brand in the service of high culture (she is vice chair of the New York City Ballet) and her own businesses  \u2014   a fragrance line and the SJP shoe collection, which she introduced in 2014 and is carried by   department stores. All along, she developed television and film ideas as a producer, including, for some time, a show called \u201cInto the Fire,\u201d which HBO passed on. It featured a   host who quits her job, blows up her career and has an affair with the father of one of her children\u2019s classmates. In some of its details, \u201cInto the Fire\u201d sounds like \u201cGirlfriends\u2019 Guide to Divorce,\u201d which has been renewed for a third season on Bravo, one of a number of television shows in recent years that have featured women in their late 40s or early 50s reinventing their love lives: On \u201cNashville,\u201d Rayna, played by Connie Britton, ends her marriage and enjoys a succession of suitors on \u201cThe Affair,\u201d Helen (Maura Tierney) is betrayed by her cheating husband but goes on to have flings of her own. \u201cI want to save my life while I still care about it,\u201d Frances tells Robert, trying to explain why she wants a divorce it\u2019s as if some sense of imminently fading possibility propels Frances into new romance. HBO suggested that Ms. Parker meet with Sharon Horgan, the producer and   of Amazon\u2019s \u201cCatastrophe,\u201d who ultimately wrote the pilot of \u201cDivorce. \u201d The resulting project appealed to Ms. Parker both for its darkness and for its    milieu. \u201cSo often when you see divorce in cinema or on television, it\u2019s like  \u2014   \u2018War of the Roses\u2019! Rich people fighting!\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to tell a different story, one that I haven\u2019t really seen on television. \u201d The bar was \u201cquite high\u201d for Ms. Parker\u2019s return, said Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s chief executive, who felt this show reached that standard. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Hollywoodization of divorce,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a very authentic one, something she could sink her teeth into creatively and artistically. \u201d Both Mr. Plepler and Ms. Parker mentioned the influence of \u201cAn Unmarried Woman,\u201d the 1978 Jill Clayburgh film that offered an unflinching look at how a flawed but charming wife handles being unexpectedly single after her husband walks out. Ms. Parker was comfortable with embracing her own character\u2019s flaws, said Paul Simms, the showrunner of \u201cDivorce. \u201d \u201cI was a little surprised and pleased that she was willing to not worry about being necessarily likable,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though she ultimately is quite likable. \u201d Though Ms. Parker spoke of the characters in \u201cDivorce\u201d as middle class, it might be more accurate to say they are upper middle class in appearance, middle class in disposable income they look like a couple with fancy educations, now tenuously maintaining a gimcrack normalcy   with the help of revolving credit lines and some    turns of luck. If Mr. Big, Carrie\u2019s beloved, represented one \u201990s male icon, the finance type, Robert, with his debt and pickup truck, represents a very current countertype, a disempowered white guy baffled to find things are no longer going his way. It only slowly dawned on Ms. Parker, she said, that HBO was expecting her to play the lead in whatever show she developed about marriage midlife. She might not have felt ready to take it on, she said, were it not for the experience she had in 2013 with \u201cThe Commons of Pensacola,\u201d a play by Amanda Peet that Ms. Parker starred in, alongside Blythe Danner. \u201cTheater demands a very specific kind of wonderful exhaustion,\u201d said Ms. Parker, \u201cwhich really reminded me of all I still wanted to do  \u2014   and how much I missed the feeling of not getting it, of being lost, and working in such a concentrated way. I really fell in love with acting again. \u201d IN CONVERSATION, Ms. Parker has a big, rewarding laugh, and a habit of turning the question on the interviewer. \u201cI\u2019m a very curious person,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was younger, my stepfather was always telling me to stop staring at people. \u201d She is also a stylish writer, a talent that shows up in her emails, which are carefully crafted and sprinkled with fanciful touches. \u201cLet me know our meeting place,\u201d she wrote, after it was settled that we would head to    where \u201cDivorce\u201d is set, on a train leaving from Grand Central Terminal. \u201cIt\u2019s romantic to meet at the clock. \u201d One morning, she arrived at the clock, perfectly prompt, dressed in   chunky sandals and an     sundress (\u201cVintage,\u201d she said, \u201cI probably paid $29 for it. \u201d) As she walked through the terminal, she moved quickly, accustomed to people stopping in their tracks, stupefied, as they recognized her. When someone tried to approach her to talk, she had a warm but effective response at the ready: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I wish I could, thank you so much, I have to catch my train!\u201d She offered a big smile, a girlish wave, direct eye contact, somehow meeting the energy of the fan with enthusiasm of her own. From a distance, to a tourist, she might have seemed a holographic conjuring, an icon of    New York there to enhance the iconic New York setting. For Ms. Parker, Grand Central Terminal evokes her \u2019  childhood, days when her own family of eight children  \u2014   then not financially stable enough to call itself middle class  \u2014   briefly lived in Dobbs Ferry, which neighbors   . \u201cMy older brother and I would come in, alone, for auditions,\u201d she said. That was when she was 12 at 13, she played Annie on Broadway. Soon after that, she became the beloved soul sister of   high school girls everywhere, playing the brainy,     Patty on CBS\u2019s   \u201cSquare Pegs. \u201d \u201cFor me, doing it was a priceless experience,\u201d Ms. Parker, all of 18, said in an interview shortly after the series ended. \u201cBut television isn\u2019t what I want. Theater and film are. \u201d She could not have known then how much cultural currency television would come to have  \u2014   or how big a role she herself would play in establishing its ascendancy. With that influence came celebrity and the kind of public scrutiny that stings, especially for a parent paparazzi and tabloid reporters are often camped outside her family\u2019s Lower Manhattan home. There have also long been tabloid rumors about the demise of her marriage, which might make the choice of a show called \u201cDivorce\u201d seem revealing, as if it were some subconscious confirmation of her preoccupations. That the public might think that, Ms. Parker said, suggests a misunderstanding of what really motivates her as an actor. \u201cWhen people ask about the ways in which I relate to Frances, I usually say, \u2018I look like her, but that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing to ask, because all you want to do as an actor is be someone else. \u201d Why, she added, \u201cwould you ever want to play someone like you?\u201d Ms. Parker sounded genuinely bewildered by the persistence of tabloid interest in her marriage. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because we just   \u2026     keep staying married,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that annoys them?\u201d Mr. Broderick, she said, is \u201cstill the person I want to experience things with, I want to do new things with. \u201d It may be a sign of the health of their current relationship that neither party feels the need to portray it as any more perfect than most that have weathered three children, two big careers and nearly two decades. Ms. Parker described marriage as a series of choices  \u2014   choosing to stay, choosing to find patience in it. \u201cIt\u2019s saying, I\u2019m going to try not to roll my eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s thinking about the delight in something that\u2019s delightful to him, but that may or may not be to you. \u201d Asked what Ms. Parker might enjoy about playing Frances, Mr. Broderick thought for a moment. \u201cShe gets to be pissed off at her husband, which I think would be fun for her,\u201d he deadpanned. But his protectiveness of Ms. Parker, as she prepared for her show\u2019s debut, was evident. \u201cI\u2019m always nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching your child walk onto the playground. You want them to be treated well. And when they\u2019re not, it\u2019s horrible to watch. \u201d Ms. Parker seems to relish the gap between the show\u2019s plot and her own reality, the way she can experience the aftershocks of a dissolution from a safe creative distance. \u201cFrances was never single with children, never single with a mortgage  \u2014   so I think all that\u2019s going to be really interesting,\u201d she said, already musing about a second season. \u201cHow much does she want to date? How much does she really want to take her clothes off with someone?\u201d Ms. Parker slapped her hand against her chest. \u201cCan you imagine? I\u2019d be like  \u2014   no, we are just going to be companions. I\u2019d be horrified!\u201d IT WOULD HAVE BEEN an easier path, in some ways, for Ms. Parker to skip all the exposure and time constraints that come with a new show, to ride out the duration of her career nurturing her brand (and businesses) in the safe, bright afterglow of Carrie. \u201cWhat do you do after you\u2019ve created one of the cultural landmarks of your time  \u2014   how do you follow it up?\u201d said the actor John Benjamin Hickey, a close friend. \u201cIf she had stopped, I would have been like, yeah, I get it. But I think she has a hunger as an artist to challenge herself, and to explore a kind of complicated darkness. Her interest in the subject matter isn\u2019t tabloidy  \u2014   it\u2019s existential. \u201d Over lunch, Ms. Parker confessed that she was somewhat terrified about the show\u2019s premiere, partly for fear that her fans might be expecting something the show was not  \u2014   that they would judge it not by its own merits, but by how closely it inspired the same giddy pleasures that her previous work has. \u201cThis is not Carrie in the suburbs, Carrie the commuter,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I kind of want to get ahead of that, so that there is not this giant heave of disappointment when people find the show is not   \u2026     that same buoyant kind of thing. \u201d Ms. Parker knows that she played Carrie for so long that many fans came to assume that the character simply was her  \u2014   that there was no effort involved in inhabiting her so fully. \u201cBut it was definitely acting,\u201d she said. \u201cI never lived any of those experiences in my own life. I\u2019m not Carrie. Sometimes I feel that if I\u2019d done my job well with \u2018Divorce,\u2019 it will be a reminder that, yes, she\u2019s an actor. But maybe people will start to think I\u2019m like Frances. And then I\u2019ll have to explain how different Sarah and Frances are. \u201d She brightened at the thought.'"}, "time": 1742561799.831709}
