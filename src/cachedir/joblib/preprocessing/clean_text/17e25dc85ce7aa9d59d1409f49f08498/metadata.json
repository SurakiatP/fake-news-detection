To say the meeting was edgy and cold would be an understatement. \\nTrump\u2019s landslide victory at the recent U.S. elections caught many off guard, and liberals are all still in deep shock that their delegate Hillary Clinton was not elected. \\nAfter the meeting at the White House, when asked about Muslims, Trump was at first hesitant about revealing his plans, but then answered emphatically that Muslims are a danger to the national security of the nation. \\nNo Sharia \\n\u201cI have already spoken in depth about Muslims. Our solution will be humane and just. Their religion is abhorrent and cannot be trusted. We cannot trust Muslims in our cities, our streets, our jobs. Look what happened in the San Bernardino shooting or the Orlando massacre? These atrocities were all committed by Muslims on U.S. citizens going about their daily lives. We can\u2019t have this savagery amongst us. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling for every Muslim to be registered in a database. We need to find out who the devout ones are, who the others are. We need to know if they own guns, and we need to stop their permits. We need to know and watch every Muslim in this country, and when the time comes I will make the final decision. We need to detain them until all the attacks stop. Detain or deport. We\u2019ll give them a choice. Let\u2019s not forget their mosques either, shut them down, we can and will do that. They have no place in America, a Christian God loving country.\u201d \\nAnother reporter asked about Muslims who wish to visit the United States. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s common sense. We have no choice. There is already a no-fly list in place for known terrorists and criminals. Our policy in the name of Homeland Security will be that all Muslims are potential terrorists. Until the war of terror is over, this will be our policy. They can go and visit some other country, but Muslims will not be welcome in America while I am president.\u201d \\nAs reporters rushed to ask further questions, Trump halted them and moved on with his entourage. \\nThere are fears for many Muslims in America today, as attacks on their person have risen by 25% already since Trump\u2019s election victory. Many are now making plans to leave of their own volition. Share on :'"}, "time": 1742563503.1910903}
