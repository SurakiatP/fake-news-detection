[Orient emphasizes what has ultimately been the demise of Obamacare. Its supporters say millions more have \u201ccoverage,\u201d i. e. insurance cards, though many can\u2019t afford its high premiums and deductibles.  \u201cThe reported success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA or ObamaCare) is based on enrollment numbers,\u201d Orient explains. \u201cMillions more have \u2018coverage.\u2019 Similarly, the predicted disasters from repeal have to do with loss of coverage. \u201d The physician continues that plans to provide universal coverage will result in \u201ctens of thousands of deaths. \u201d In the fervor to keep Obamacare\u2019s   conditions provision and the push further for universal coverage, Orient asks where the data are on the ACA\u2019s actual impact: Where are the statistics about the number of heart operations done on babies born with birth defects, the latest poster children? How about the number of babies saved by this surgery, and the number allowed to die without an attempt at surgery \u2014  before and after ACA? I haven\u2019t seen them. Note that an insurance plan doesn\u2019t do the operation. A doctor does. The insurer can, however, try to block it. Also missing are figures on the number of courses of cancer chemotherapy given, or not given, or the time from diagnosis to death in cancer patients before and after ACA.   survival of cancer patients in the U. S. is generally better than in countries that have universal coverage, or the type of plan progressives want to import. Again, the insurance plan isn\u2019t medicine. You can get medicine without insurance, and if you have insurance it might refuse to pay. Orient observes that, between 2014 and 2015, U. S. mortality rates increased for the first time in decades. \u201cThis primarily affected   whites,\u201d she notes. \u201cIs Obamacare the cause? There are many factors involved, drug abuse probably being the most important. But I suspect that if repeal had happened in 2012 or 2013, it would have been blamed. \u201d \u201cMedicaid expansion may have alleviated fears of medical bankruptcy, but we don\u2019t know that more patients got treatment,\u201d Orient continues. \u201cIn   Canada, there is no fear of a medical bill. But there might not be any treatment either. \u201d In October of last year, Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber admitted the ACA was working just as it was designed  \u2014   jacking up premiums and deductibles, and limiting choices for its customers. \u201cThe main goal of Obamacare was \u201d Gruber, an MIT economics professor, said on CNN, continuing: One was to cover the uninsured, of which we\u2019ve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare. \u201cJonathan Gruber exposed himself as not credible and simply a propaganda minister of Obamacare when he was exposed explaining the grand deception perpetrated on the American public,\u201d Dr. Gerard Gianoli, a specialist in   and skull base surgery, told Breitbart News. \u201cTo claim that Obamacare is working is almost too ridiculous to comment upon, unless the purpose of Obamacare was to drive up insurance premiums, while providing less options for health care and destroying the best medical care system in the world. \u201d Orient agrees, observing that experts beating the universal healthcare drum \u201cknow very well that resources are limited, and that spending (\u2018costs\u2019) must be contained. \u201d She adds: They also understand that the burgeoning bureaucracy and its minions and retainers must be well paid. So the answer is to cut services. Some plans \u201cincentivize\u201d doctors to make more money by skimping on care. Others call for a \u201cglobal budget\u201d \u2014  the deliberate creation of scarcity. When the money is gone, treatment is canceled. There will be fewer beds, fewer CT scanners, fewer drugs, and fewer doctors. But all will be fair. No rationing by price, just by waiting lines, political pull  \u2014   and death. There will be no medical bills to pay after a service, if you get any service. Only taxes in advance, service or no service. Dr. Kristin Held, a   ophthalmologist and surgeon, explains how Obamacare obliterated   medical care and that even many Republicans still refuse to embrace the free market when it comes to health care, a situation that will keep healthcare costs high: In a normal free market, people can look for a less expensive car or a different dealer. But ObamaCare outlawed the insurance products that millions of people had and were satisfied with. No more \u201cbare bones\u201d policies for instance. The leather seats and   entertainment \u201coption\u201d are no longer optional. And no heading to the dealer across the street \u2014  or the state line \u2014  who\u2019ll make you a better deal. The government has fixed the prices, the products, and the dealers. You may be shocked to hear that \u201c \u201d Republicans didn\u2019t fix that. They\u2019ll let you do without the car, but you can\u2019t get a cheaper one. After all, the Obama car features are immensely popular. They are certainly popular with certain groups: Held explains that if Republicans retain the \u201c\u2019guaranteed   rating\u2019 features that always and everywhere send premiums into the stratosphere,\u201d insurers can\u2019t price their products by level of risk, and premiums will still go higher. She urges Republicans to address \u201cthe entrenched flaws that keep the costs up\u201d in health care. \u201cWe must continuously remind ourselves that the goal is survival of our patients, not the survival of big insurance corporations, political careers, and   parasites,\u201d she asserts. \u201cWe need an ambulance not a Monster truck, and most importantly we must drain the swamp. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563176.6097481}
