The report, which first appeared in The  Mail on Sunday and was summarized in Breitbart News, the   opinion and news site, cited incomplete data and drew incorrect conclusions, the scientists said. Federal and international agencies have said that 2016 will likely be the hottest year on record, eclipsing the record set last year. In its report, The Mail on Sunday cited a recent decline in temperatures over land since the weather phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o ended this year, and said that El Ni\u00f1o, and not climate change, was responsible for the record heat. But scientists said that while the recent El Ni\u00f1o did contribute to the record warmth, climate change played a major role, too. \u201cNobody said the record temperatures were exclusively the result of climate change,\u201d said Mike Halpert, the deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Prediction Center. Deke Arndt, the chief of the climate monitoring branch at the NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, said that the   warming trend was quite clear, and that the impact of El Ni\u00f1o was in addition to what were already higher temperatures. \u201cYou can have both climate change and a goose from El Ni\u00f1o,\u201d he said. In an El Ni\u00f1o, water temperatures increase in the eastern equatorial Pacific, affecting air temperatures and weather worldwide. Sea surface temperatures have declined since their peak earlier this year, and now the opposite condition  \u2014   La Ni\u00f1a, with water temperatures lower than normal  \u2014   prevails. Scientists are not surprised that some global temperatures are falling and expect that temperatures next year will be below those of the past two years because of La Ni\u00f1a. \u201cBut it\u2019s still likely to be quite a bit warmer than average,\u201d Mr. Halpert said. Scientists said the news media reports were also faulty in that they cited only temperatures over land, which account for about 30 percent of Earth\u2019s surface. Temperatures over land are much more variable than those over water because land stores relatively little heat. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be making   assessments,\u201d Dr. Arndt said, \u201cyou need to be looking at   data. \u201d Global data show a slower decline in temperatures than   data, scientists said. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology posted about the Breitbart News report on Twitter on Thursday. The committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, has accused the Obama administration of having a \u201csuspect climate agenda. \u201d The House committee\u2019s Twitter post drew sharp rebukes from scientists and others, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who wrote on Twitter referring to an academic expert cited in the article. The Mail on Sunday report, which was written by David Rose, was also strongly disputed online. One blogger headlined a post on the subject: \u201cHow Stupid Does David Rose Think You Are?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563308.7508368}
