He had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago. Gait is a married mother of five, and long-term American resident in Britain. Her support of the pro-life movement is driven by \u201cthankfulness and praise\u201d for life and her Christian faith. \\nWitnessing abortion\u2019s heavy toll on the living and dead, Gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing. Subtle and working entirely with symbolism, these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion. Rather, they mourn in color, symbol and tone with single shoes, broken cord, dead flowers and other lonely and broken things. \u201cTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas\u201dpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X \\nWhen a friend first visited Gait\u2019s studio, he was struck by her abortion paintings. Confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child, he wrote: \u201cI realize your work comes from a place of great love, for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture.\u201d \\nGait invited him to pray with her for his lost child. It happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby, five years to the day. Father X remembers every detail. \\nTheir conversation grew into a joint effort, culminating in a book, \u201c Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas: Meditations on Post Abortion Trauma .\u201d Father X wanted to remain anonymous, as a place-setter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion. He wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of Gait\u2019s 30 paintings in this book, which have also been shown together in art exhibits. \\nTime and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion, Gait claims. Rather, \u201cthe past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence, guilt and remorse has not abated.\u201d You can see that in the words of Father X, which run the gamut of human emotions. \u201cOn Abortion: Shoe, Pot and Crosses\u201dfrom \u201cTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas\u201d \\n\u201cJonah of Nineveh\u201d features an upended, single rose with red cords and funereal foliage. Flowers are \u201calready in the birth position, head down and waiting to be born.\u201d Torn and shroud-like ribbons hang across the painting. Spirals represent a child\u2019s DNA helix and the \u201cveil of the Temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation.\u201d Father X makes an analogy between Jonah fleeing \u201cparental responsibility\u201d and eventual redemption \u2013 then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness: \u201cIt was her wedding dress, my sea green empress, this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives. She was full of fear. \u2026\u201d \\nIn some of these works, hammers incongruently hang with flowers. They are bloody or blackened, some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose. Father X interprets these tools as decision markers, to either build or tear down. In \u201cHammer of Decision,\u201d it belongs to Thor, the war god \u201cinfested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction.\u201d Wagner, the Olympics, \u201csperm races,\u201d Thomas Moore and Valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author. Either the Carpenter\u2019s \u201chammer of wisdom\u201d or Thor\u2019s \u201ctool of chaos\u201d will be chosen by expectant parents. \u201cHammer, Suspended\u201d \\n\u201c Troubadours \u201d runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology. Striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion, the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities. This includes moonlighting for angels, celestial games, \u201cinterstellar wind-jammers\u201d and a \u201cbaby steamer sailing on children\u2019s seas,\u201d among other delightful prospects. Lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their Limbos. \\nFather X occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the Bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions. Running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters, these are not theological statements, but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion. \\nIn Gait\u2019s \u201cPink Rose\u201d and \u201cStardust,\u201d we see empty fields, withered plants and other tokens. Father X takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children. He places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles, which is reflected in the painting. Children are disfigured, or missing eyes or arms and singing in \u201clow mournful tones\u201d so as not to disturb their parents. Music is \u201cintense, equivalent to the sound created by Hildegard von Bingen (a 12th-century nun and composer). \u201cTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas\u201dpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X \\nReferences to Mary as a mother are common, as well as other scriptural allusions. \u201cAll babies jump for Jesus\u201d in the womb (or in \u201cits sack of nibbling yoke\u201d) writes Father X. Elizabeth\u2019s child John \u201cleapt for joy, just as his ancestor David did before the ark of the covenant,\u201d he continues. \\nGait addresses the human embryo, finding Biblical, ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages. Her \u201cAbbey Target Beginning\u201d has a crosshair target, which is interpreted spiritually: \u201cThe first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread \u2013 the bread on fire with the Holy Spirit the same stage of development as the child in Mary\u2019s womb when she arrived at her cousin Elizabeth\u2019s house.\u201d \\nPost-abort guilt isn\u2019t rationalized or downplayed, but emotionally reacted to in art and word. Father X describes bats as whirling about \u201cin circles at the pitiful sound the [aborted] children make\u201d because they are tuned to such distressing signals. This contrasts with many parents who are \u201cstill stone deaf\u201d to such mournful sounds. At another point, Father-X imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus, a roar of unwanted thoughts. \u201cTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas\u201dpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X \\nFather X elaborates on what Gait hints in her paintings: the injustice and evil of abortion. He cites a world built on slavery before Christ\u2019s advent, and the works of such men as William Wilberforce and John Brown in furthering Christ\u2019s gospel of justice and peace. All this is contrasted to abortion throughout. \\nRuminating on Gait\u2019s \u201cPalms of our Lord,\u201d Father X claims \u201cthe face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion. \u201cPalms\u201d is murky, with a single, red hand print. \u201cTo look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the Tarot of Ruins,\u201d he continues. \\n\u201cSuicide\u201d advances this dark theme, where Gait and Father X criticize the death industry and it\u2019s euphemistically named \u201cclinics.\u201d He takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings: \u201c\u2026 a caricature of a woman who made a mistake, who got herself in trouble, who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart.\u201d \\nBut all isn\u2019t baleful and sad here. In \u201cCloud Children,\u201d Father X muses on paper dolls in Gait\u2019s paintings with this lovely thought: \u201cWhere children go \u2026 is a mystery. \u2026 Some say they take their daytime rest in Christ\u2019s tomb in Jerusalem, and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled Star Ships.\u201d \\n\u201c Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas \u201d is a work of meditation, grief counseling, poetry, social commentary and visual art. Father X may not reveal his identity here, but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child. Gait and Father X describe their efforts as a \u201csilent prayer of witness for all the ghost families, those Phantoms of Sorrows, who will never laugh or cry together as a family, because of an abortion.\u201d They hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way. \\nJudith Gait is a graduate of California College of Arts and Crafts and received a Masters at Oxford\u2019s Ruskin School of Fine Drawing. Her work is in public and private collections in America and abroad. She is an American citizen, residing in Britain. Father X is an addictions counselor and writer in Great Britain, who prefers to remain anonymous. \\n\u201cTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas:Meditations on Post Abortion Trauma\u201d is a coffee-table size, 103-page paper book, with 33 color-illustrations and related commentary.
