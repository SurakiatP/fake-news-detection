[\u201cThere are only two rules in the Latino family,\u201d Lopez said Saturday night during a live show in Phoenix. \u201cDon\u2019t marry somebody black and don\u2019t park in front of our house. \u201d  Video posted by TMZ shows a woman in the audience giving Lopez the middle finger and appearing to be offended by the comic\u2019s pun. Lopez apparently saw the woman protesting his set and proceeded to offer her some pointed advice: \u201cSit your f*ckin\u2019 ass down! Sit your f*ckin\u2019 ass down! I\u2019m talking, b*tch. You paid to see a show. So sit your f*cking ass down!\u201d [Warning: Explicit Language] But the former ABC star\u2019s harsh demands appeared to enrage the woman even more. Determined to take back control of his show, he doubled down: \u201cYou can\u2019t take a joke, you\u2019re in the wrong motherf*cking place,\u201d he said as the crowd cheered him on. \u201cSit your f*cking ass down or get the f*ck out of here,\u201d Lopez warned. Toward the end of the clip, Lopez apparently had the woman removed from the building. \u201cI tell you what, I\u2019ll make the choice for you. Get the f*ck out of here,\u201d he said as the woman was escorted from her table. \u201cFour seats just opened up front. \u201d The    comedian appeared to address the controversy on his Twitter account Tuesday morning. \u201cYou have 2 choices  have a good day or get the f*ck out,\u201d he tweeted.
