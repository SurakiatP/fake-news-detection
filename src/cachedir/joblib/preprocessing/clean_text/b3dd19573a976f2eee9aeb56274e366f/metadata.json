He said if Clinton wasn\u2019t eventually indicted, it was almost certain there would be a data dump ( click for related story ) from within the FBI, from agents who were upset with James Comey\u2019s decision not to recommend Clinton be indicted for mishandling classified information. When Comey, in July, didn\u2019t recommend to Attorney General Loretta Lynch that Clinton be indicted, a data dump of sorts did take place when the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server was hacked. \\nCould it be that the DNC hack was done from within the federal government? After its server\u2019s emails were hacked for the whole world to see, the DNC was exposed for working with mainstream media members to rig the primaries for Clinton against Bernie Sanders, and a concerted effort was made to paint him in a negative light (something that led to the resignation of DNC head Debbie Wasserman Schultz). But the Democrats responded by declaring the intrusion was the work of Russian hackers \u2014 an allegation the Russians deny. \\nBut now, it seems, the effects of not recommending Clinton for indictment are far worse than predicted. On Friday, James Comey conveyed to members of Congress that the once closed investigation of Clinton\u2019s private email server is now open again, just days before Clinton or Donald Trump will be elected as the next U.S. president. The announcement was made after more Clinton emails turned up in an investigation into Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting of a 15-year-old girl from NC . Weiner is Huma Abedin\u2019s estranged husband and Abedin is Clinton\u2019s closest confidant. \\nBut according to The Daily Mail, there exists an even greater problem Comey is facing which prompted him to reopen the case; the wholesale resignation of disgruntled FBI agents. One source close to Comey says it\u2019s his last ditch attempt to save face for himself and the reputation of the FBI. \\nAccording to the Daily Mail , and a source close to James Comey, the decision, at least in part, came after he \u201ccould no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI\u201d who \u201cfelt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.\u201d \\nEd Klein, journalist for the Mail, described Comey as being depressed over the mounting stack of resignation letters he\u2019s received as a result of his decision not to recommend charges be brought against Clinton. Klein quoted a close friend of Comey\u2019s as saying, \u201c\u2019The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn\u2019t recommend an indictment against Hillary,\u2019 said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week.\u201d \\nKlein\u2019s source continued, \u201c\u2019Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,\u2019 said the source. \u2018They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.\u2019\u201d \\nThe DM journalist continued quoting his informant as saying, \u201c\u2019When new emails that appeared to be related to Hillary\u2019s personal email server turned up in a computer used [her close aide] Huma Abedin and [Abedin\u2019s disgraced husband,] Anthony Weiner, Comey jumped at the excuse to reopen the investigation.\u2019\u201d \\nBut Comey\u2019s problems aren\u2019t isolated to his workplace. He reportedly has problems at home as well. Klein\u2019s source continued, \u201c\u2019The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him\u2026that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state.\u2019\u201d \\nComey\u2019s friend told Klein he\u2019s being shunned by many within the FBI and that President Obama and Lynch are \u201cfurious\u201d with him for reopening the case against Clinton. According to the DM\u2019s source, \u201c\u2019Lynch and Obama haven\u2019t contacted Jim directly\u2026they\u2019ve made it crystal clear through third parties that they disapprove of his effort to save face.\u2019\u201d \\nBut the reopened investigation may be too little too late. The damage to the FBI\u2019s investigation appears to be done, and no amount of scrambling to save face is likely to fix it. In the mind of many Americans, when former president Bill Clinton met AG Lynch on the tarmac in Phoenix, Arizona, the fix was in for Hillary. Comey proved to be a pawn and has passed himself off as an impotent benefactor of the Clintons. Share Social Trending'"}, "time": 1742628497.5792723}
