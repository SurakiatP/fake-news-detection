Edward Mullins to accept an award on behalf of his New York City police union.  Partial transcript as follows: He either is just indulging his obsessions or maybe some private prison interest maybe have an interest in him and he\u2019s going to enrich them, or this is about a kind of trolling of people of color that is common in your party. Jefferson Sessions, amid the turmoil he\u2019s facing now on Russiagate and other things, took the time out to be honored by a police union boss here in New York, a guy named Edward Mullens  \u2014   an incredibly controversial guy. He\u2019s been called \u201cCrazy Eddie\u201d by the former NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton. This is a guy who objected to the Eric Garner settlement, who said it was a travesty, who walked out when police had to admit that they beat, I think, a     man and they had to settle, he walked out and called that a travesty. He objected to Beyonce\u2019s performance at the Super Bowl. This is an extremist and Jeff Sessions proudly stands next to him. Is this cultural trolling and Jeff Sessions is a member of a troll army? Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742563522.1848228}
