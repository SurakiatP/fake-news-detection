Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Sessions offered attorney general post.   Donald J. Trump has chosen Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama for the cabinet position. While Mr. Sessions, a close adviser to Mr. Trump, is well liked in the Senate, his record as a federal prosecutor in the 1980s may become an issue for Democrats and civil rights groups. Also today, Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas was picked to run the C. I. A. He\u2019s a former Army officer who gained prominence during the hearings into the 2012 attack on an American compound in Benghazi, Libya. The news follows a report from a top official who says Mr. Trump has asked Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn to be his national security adviser. General Flynn has helped shape the  \u2019s view that the U. S. is at \u201cworld war\u201d with Islamist militants. \u2022 More transition news. Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet this weekend with someone who once called him a \u201cphony\u201d: Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. The meeting comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s    Jared Kushner, seeks a way to join the administration without violating   laws. \u2022 What does \u201cAmerica First\u201d mean? The slogan used by Mr. Trump to describe his philosophy on governing is being put to the test. We look at the challenges the   faces on Iran, North Korea and Syria and in Europe. Separately, Mr. Trump said on Twitter Thursday night that he helped save a Ford plant from leaving for Mexico. The company, though, never planned to move the factory. Meanwhile, President Obama is meeting with European leaders today in Berlin and will then head to Peru for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting. \u2022 A tale of two nations. Our reporters and photographers spent the past week gauging the feelings of Americans. \u201cThey returned with a portrait of a country at odds with itself,\u201d our magazine editor says. Our graphics team took a different approach: They created two maps that represent the divide between Republicans and Democrats. \u2022 Finding hope after hate. You may have read this week about a recent wave of reports of   attacks. But the violence has been countered by acts of public support and solidarity, as in the case of an Iraqi family in Maryland after they found a threat taped to their door. \u2022 Potential agricultural breakthrough. Scientists announced a discovery that could increase the world\u2019s food supply. Using genetic engineering to tinker with photosynthesis, they were able to boost a plant\u2019s productivity as much as 20 percent. One scientist said gains of 50 percent were possible. \u2022 Social media\u2019s role in U. S. politics, and the fake news sometimes used to sway voters, is now in the spotlight, but other nations have been dealing with the problem for years. Chatbots releasing false information on Twitter were used to disrupt political discussions in the U. S. a new study found. \u2022 In memoriam: Ruth Baron Ziff, 92, a sociologist and trailblazer in the   advertising world of the 1950s. Her work influenced the famous \u201cPlease don\u2019t squeeze the Charmin\u201d toilet paper commercials. \u2022 Worried about what you can\u2019t control? Our personal finance columnist offers ways to cope with anxieties over the economy and politics. \u2022 U. S. stocks were up on Thursday. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Chasing pirates on the Amazon. Piracy is a growing menace in South America. Join a police force on a patrol in Brazil. \u2022 New at the movies. We review \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\u201d a footnote to the films based on J. K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter books. \u201cThis time out the wizard isn\u2019t a boy on the verge of manhood but a man idling in boyhood,\u201d our critic writes. Navigating the teenage years is at the heart of \u201cThe Edge of Seventeen. \u201d The comedy, our critic says, \u201ccan hold its own\u201d with movies like \u201cClueless\u201d that have raised the bar for teenage films. \u2022 A lost world is found. Archaeologists hit the jackpot this fall in the Black Sea. The discovery of a sunken medieval ship led to finding dozens more shipwrecks off Bulgaria\u2019s coast. \u201cWe can expect some real contributions to our understanding of ancient trade routes,\u201d one researcher said. \u2022 The American Thanksgiving. The country will celebrate one of its most cherished holidays next week. Fifteen families showed us the dishes they make that speak most eloquently about their traditions. Their stories, our food editor writes, tell \u201cthe story of who we are. \u201d \u2022 Recipe of the day. Make tonight a taco night. Try versions with fish or pork. Over the weekend, brush up on how to cook brussels sprouts. Brazil is celebrating an important holiday on Sunday, though it\u2019s one that may be unfamiliar outside the country: Black Consciousness Day. Slavery existed in Brazil until 1888, making it the last country in the Americas to abolish the practice. More than five million slaves were sent to Brazil through the Atlantic trade, compared with about 300, 000 in mainland North America, according to one of the most thoroughly researched academic estimates. Today the nation has more residents of African heritage than any other country outside Africa. The population has historically been underrepresented in government, but a rise in citizens identifying as black or mixed race is helping to chip away at economic and educational inequalities. Black Consciousness Day was established in 2003, featuring the \u201cFreedom Walk\u201d  \u2014   parades around the country meant to show the size of the black population. The date, Nov. 20, was set for the anniversary of the death of Zumbi dos Palmares, one of the great black heroes of the Americas. He led a small kingdom founded by runaway slaves. He was killed by the Portuguese in 1695, after they overran his republic. But the power of his story has only grown as the country embraces its African roots. A researcher with the   Museum in S\u00e3o Paulo sees more progress ahead: \u201cWe Brazilian blacks are finally learning to be black. \u201d _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
