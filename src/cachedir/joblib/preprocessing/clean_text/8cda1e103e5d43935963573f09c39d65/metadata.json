Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. \\nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. \\nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton\u2019s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is \u201crigged.\u201d \\nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). \\n\u201cI do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,\u201d said Sen. Clinton. \u201cAnd if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.\u201d Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742562902.8719275}
