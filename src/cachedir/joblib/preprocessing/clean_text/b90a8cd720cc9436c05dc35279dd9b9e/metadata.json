But Mr. Zinke also emphasized his support for drilling, mining and logging on federal lands, activities strongly opposed by many environmental groups. In   testimony before a Senate panel that lasted nearly four hours, Mr. Zinke, a former member of the Navy SEALs who just finished his first term in the House, tried to balance the importance of preservation with use of the nation\u2019s public lands and waters. He expressed admiration for Gifford Pinchot, the first United States Forest Service chief, who advocated planned use and renewal. Mr. Zinke also said he supported energy development on federal lands. Recreational activities and mining, for instance, are not mutually exclusive, he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be in conflict,\u201d he said. Mr. Zinke broke with   Donald J. Trump and even his own past statements on climate change, disagreeing with Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion at one point that it is \u201ca hoax. \u201d Having once said that climate change was \u201cnot proven science,\u201d Mr. Zinke said it was \u201cindisputable\u201d that the climate is changing and that humans are having an effect on it. \u201cI think where there\u2019s debate is what that influence is, what we can do about it,\u201d Mr. Zinke said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a hoax,\u201d he added. He later appeared to try to temper his statement, emphasizing the need for \u201cobjective science. \u201d Democrats pressed Mr. Zinke, who grew up near Glacier National Park in Montana, about whether he would shield federal lands from being sold, one of their primary concerns. \u201cWith a new administration, are these public lands going to face an unbelievable attack by those who would like to take these public lands away from us and turn them over back to states?\u201d asked Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the panel\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cOr are we going to continue to manage these resources for the incredible investment that they are and continue to improve them, so we get even more economic return?\u201d Mr. Zinke was unequivocal: \u201cI am absolutely against transfer and sale of public lands. I can\u2019t be more clear. \u201d Asked about his vote on a House rule that would make it easier for the government to cede control of federal lands, he acknowledged that he would not vote for it again. \u201cThat\u2019s a great answer,\u201d said Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico. Mr. Zinke said one of his priorities as interior secretary would be to address an estimated $12. 5 billion backlog of maintenance and repairs in the national parks system. He also stated his support for fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which takes money from offshore oil and gas leasing to protect federal natural resources. In one of his few references to the   Mr. Zinke said Mr. Trump supported moving toward energy independence. He described his own approach as \u201call of the above,\u201d explicitly mentioning solar and wind power, as well as fossil fuels. Republicans expressed their own concerns  \u2014   about the need for a break from what they saw as an era of   under the Obama administration. In her opening statement, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the panel\u2019s chairwoman, called her state \u201cthe poster child\u201d among the many that suffered under the current Department of the Interior. \u201cFor eight years, it seemed that this administration has taken the approach that Alaska has to be protected from Alaskans,\u201d she said, \u201cand they acted accordingly. \u201d Senators praised Mr. Zinke\u2019s   career in the Navy SEALs as an asset, with Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, calling him a \u201cwell equipped\u201d candidate. But Mr. Zinke\u2019s time in the military was not without controversy. While serving as a midlevel SEAL Team 6 officer in the 1990s, Mr. Zinke improperly sought government reimbursement for travel to his home, a decision that resulted in some of his superiors\u2019 questioning his judgment and apparently prevented him from being entrusted with a senior post, a New York Times investigation showed. His military background was referenced in a testy exchange with Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois and a fellow veteran. She pointed to the fact that Mr. Zinke embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s defense of his 2005 statements about sexually assaulting women, caught on a hot mike, as \u201c  talk\u201d and questioned whether he was equipped to handle the problem of sexual harassment and assault, also a problem in the military, in the agency he seeks to lead. Mr. Zinke, who served with Ms. Duckworth in the House until recently, said he would have a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to sexual harassment, which he said was \u201ckilling morale\u201d at the agency.'"}, "time": 1742562139.1726346}
