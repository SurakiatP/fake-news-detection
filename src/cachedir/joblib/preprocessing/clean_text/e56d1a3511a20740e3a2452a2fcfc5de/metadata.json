October 28, 2016 \\nReprinted from NyTimes.com. \\n\\nShe leads a clandestine existence, on the move and under 24-hour guard as France\u2019s most protected woman. Yet Zineb El Rhazoui, the Charlie Hebdo journalist who happened to be in Casablanca on January 7 last year, the day terrorists \u201cavenging the Prophet\u201d massacred nine people at the satirical magazine in Paris, believes she has a duty to defy Islamists desperate to silence her. \\nShaken but undeterred by the fatwas and relentless, precise death threats issued via social media to \u201ckill the bitch\u201d since she helped produce the publication\u2019s first survivors\u2019 issue following the attack \u2014 and spoke about it in Arabic for the Arab press \u2014 the Moroccan-French writer refuses to assume an anonymous identity. Fleeing Paris or abandoning her human rights activism, and her unforgiving critiques of the religion she grew up with, are also out of the question. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the right to renounce my struggle, or to give up my freedom,\u201d says the reporter and sociologist of religion in an interview with Women in the World, during a recent trip to New York, as part of French president Francois Hollande\u2019s delegation when he received the Appeal of Conscience Foundation\u2019s World Statesman Award for 2016. \u201cIf the French state protects me it is not little individual me: What is being protected is my freedom to be irreverent, and freedom of expression, so I should exercise this even more because I enjoy this protection.\u201d \\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally crazy. I have done nothing against the law and have nothing to hide, yet I live with security while those who threaten us are free,\u201d El Rhazoui declares with an air of shock and anger that underscores the arbitrariness and brutality visited on a 34-year-old woman condemned to living on the run and mostly in the shadows. \u201cAnd if you call them by their names you are Islamophobic and racist. I am racist? I can teach them a few things about Arab culture. I can show them how to discover its richness and the diversity of their culture. I believe this culture deserves universality because you can be Arab, Muslim and a free thinker.\u201d \\nResisting terror \\nSweeping in to the offices of Women in the World in Manhattan, accompanied by bodyguards, the world-renowned journalist is living proof of her pledge to keep \u201cliving her life beyond its limits\u201d as a key way of resisting terror. Elegant and beautiful, with her long, wavy hair flowing freely and in an impeccably tailored black dress, El Rhazoui is reminiscent of 1940s cinema\u2019s cerebral heroines \u2014 her eloquence and composure only occasionally betraying the trauma of the past 20 months. Each time we speak about the aftermath of the massacre at her magazine and how she is coping personally her voice quavers, but when the subject comes back to her fight for reform in Islamic civilization she is fearless. \\nIn this spirit, El Rhazoui, obliged to spend most of her time in hiding, like Salman Rushdie after his 1989 publication of The Satanic Verses , has taken the high-risk option of publishing an explosive new book about Islam. \\nDetruire Le Fascisme Islamique ( Destroy Islamic Fascism ), being released in France this week, takes the battle of ideas directly to the ideologically-driven zealots who inspired the assassins of her dear friend Charb (Stephane Charbonnier), late editor of Charlie Hebdo who preferred \u201cto die standing than to live on my knees.\u201d \\nObtained exclusively by Women in the World, the book dedicated to \u201cMuslim atheists\u201d is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of Islam by imitating the first Salafists or \u201cpious ancestors.\u201d The Prophet Mohammed and his companions, whose violent exploits are contained in \u201cbellicose texts from a barbaric 7th-century Bedouin tribal context,\u201d exhibited codes of behavior El Rhazoui insists have no place in the modern world and can be directly connected to terrorism. \u201cThe most abject crimes of Islamic State are but a 21st-century remake of what the first Muslims accomplished under the guidance of the Prophet,\u201d she writes, noting that sexual and domestic slavery, the massacre of non-Muslims (notably Jews), pedophilia, pillage, polygamy and summary executions were all adopted from pre-Islamic societies. The book is also the journalist\u2019s way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades, who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere \u2014 with Islam no exception to their traditional French anti-clerical ridicule \u2014 through satire and caricature. \\nFormerly the magazine\u2019s religion writer, El Rhazoui is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management. Flush with cash from international donations, the fundamentally altered publication, she disappointedly explained, \u201c will probably never again draw the Prophet \u201d out of fear of more reprisals. \\n\u201c[And] those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of Mohammed forget that everywhere that Islam reigns as the religion of the state, caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed\u201d. El Rhazoui\u2019s book, dedicated to \u201cMuslim atheists,\u201d is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of Islam. Religion of peace and love? \\n\u201cWe need to admit that Islamism today is applied Islam,\u201d El Rhazoui \u2014 who describes herself as an \u201catheist of Muslim culture\u201d \u2013writes, responding to politicians, religious figures, Islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that \u201creal Islam\u201d has nothing to do with such terror. \\n\u201cWhen we apply Islam to the letter it gives Islamism, and when we apply Islamism to the letter it gives terrorism. So we need to stop saying Islam is a religion of peace and love. What is a moderate Islamist? An Islamist who doesn\u2019t kill?\u201d \\nThe essay-length book is in the grand French polemical tradition of Emile Zola whose J\u2019accuse denounced the anti-Semitism of the French state and establishment during the Dreyfus Affair, on the eve of the 20th century. El Rhazoui, who holds Moroccan and French citizenship, takes aim at a very 21st-century phenomenon: what she abhors as the \u201cintellectual fraud\u201d of Islamophobia, which pretends to be about anti-racism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of Islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all Muslims. Epitomized by the French Collective Against Islamophobia (CCIF), this deliberate strategy vilifies as Islamophobic voices such as El Rhazoui\u2019s who dare question the religion the CCIF and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism. \\nThe notion of Islamophobia doesn\u2019t even exist in Muslim countries, the author points out, because outside the West, criticism of the religion or Mohammed is officially \u201ccategorized as blasphemy.\u201d \\n\u201cUnable to pass blasphemy laws in Europe, groups like the CCIF employ a dangerous \u201csemantic confusion,\u201d she said. On the CCIF site it is written \u201cIslamophobia is not an opinion: it is an offense.\u201d \\n\u201cThis is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards Islam and Muslims. Yet criticism of an idea, of Islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime. I was born and lived under the Islam of Morocco and live in France and I have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of Islamophobia that says I have no right to criticize! If we criticize Christianity it doesn\u2019t mean we are Christianophobes or racist towards the \u2018Christian race.\u2019\u201d \\nThe widespread pressure to self-censor is severe, El Rhazoui says. \\n\u201cYou can no longer speak about Islam without saying it\u2019s a religion of peace and love. But when you open any book in Islam what do you find? Violence, blood, oppression of women and hate for other religions. \\n\u201cOf course you can find this in other religions, however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity. As long as we don\u2019t talk about this, and keep repeating that Islam is a religion of peace and love, many people will continue to believe the Koran is a constitution, and that rather than being a book written 15 centuries ago reflecting a particular context, it is a legal constitution to apply today.\u201d \\nZineb El Rhazoui feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead Charlie Hebdo comrades. \\nAfter completing high school in Morocco, El Rhazoui studied languages and the sociology of religion, obtaining a Master\u2019s degree from Paris\u2019s prestigious social science graduate school EHESS. In her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at Le Journal Hebdomadaire, becoming a campaigner for secular liberties, such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of Ramadan. This act of non-violent resistance earned her her first fatwa, ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the Arab Spring in 2011. The wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against Ramadan rules prompted her to leave Morocco again for France where she began to report for Charlie Hebdo, bringing her memories of having \u201cvomited up compulsory religious classes\u201d in a country where \u201cbeing Muslim is not a choice\u201d unless you\u2019re Jewish or Christian. \\nExtreme personality cult \\nSo-called Islamic fascism, seen in its most extreme form in groups like ISIS, shares characteristics in common with all extreme-right fascisms, El Rhazoui argues, because it combines an intense personality cult around Mohammed as the incarnation of the nation. It also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation, exemplified by \u201csartorial branding\u201d \u2014 for example Burkinis or niqabs \u2014 that allow for immediate identification and targeting of non-adherents. There are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals, armed militias, adoption of a flag, and a strategy that confers the benign status of \u2018Muslim women\u2019 to heavily veiled adherents in the West, and characterizes them, disingenuously, as victimized objects of exclusion. \\n\u201cThe literary corpus of Islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma,\u201d El Rhazoui writes. \\n\u201cIf the terrorists of Daesh [ISIS] behead those they judge to be miscreants, that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the 8th surah of the Koran, al-Anfal, verse 12: \u201cRemember what Your Lord revealed to the angels : I am with you, so support those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. You can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip\u201d. \\n\u2018You can be Arab, Muslim and a free thinker\u2019 \\nDrawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of Islam\u2019s core Arabic texts, the politics of the post-Arab Spring Middle East, and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multi-faceted Islamic civilization, El Rhazoui\u2019s book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politico-religious repression dead. \\nThe greatest racism is, El Rhazoui argues, the racism of the Islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not Muslims, and that rejects women. \u201cThat is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it,\u201d the writer adds. \\n\u201cToday Islam in the world only has a role as a civilization. A civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion \u2014 but also by its geographical heritage, its artistic, culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature. \\n\u201cThe Muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today: universal principles of equality between men and women, sexual and individual freedom, and equality for all, no matter your creed or religion. Until Islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it, Islam will not be acceptable.\u201d \\n\u2018Islamophobia whiners\u2019 \\nDestroy Islamic Fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and faux-intellectual \u201cfakery\u201d (the author\u2019s word) of \u201cIslamophobia whiners\u201d and other \u201ccollaborationists\u201d from across the political spectrum \u2014 particularly the hard left, \u201cCrypto-Islamist\u201d anti-racists on a quest for a new \u201cMuslim proletariat,\u201d certain feminists, cultural relativists and so-called moderate Imams. All these \u201cwilling accomplices\u201d do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of Islamic State, the author says, but also makes the lives of millions of Muslims living in Islamic countries downright miserable. \\n\u201cWhat do these Islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in Islamic theocracies and dream of liberty?\u201d El Rhazoui concludes in her book. \u201cWho speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of Algiers, Casablanca or Cairo in a skirt?\u2026 those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it? \u2026 about homosexuals, pariahs of Muslim societies, who often only have the choice of death, prison or exile? Who speaks about this youth born Muslim but dreaming of a normal life, these teens attacked for having had a romance?\u201d \\n\\n\\nThe summer furore over Burkini bans in France agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of Islamists and their Western sympathizers in the media, academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of \u201cliberation\u201d and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by \u201cMuslim women,\u201d even though most never wear it. \\n\u201cWestern media, in an intolerable readiness to oblige, have defended the Burkini as a \u2018freedom\u2019 and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity,\u201d she said, but pointed out that \u201cin Muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with Burkinis, but they are emptying themselves of women. From one year to another, they are disappearing from the public space, because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior.\u201d \\nAs for mainstream or moderate Muslim clerics, El Rhazoui tells Women in the World that during the Burkini debate in France not one Imam stood up and said \u201cHey, wait a minute, you can be Muslim and wear a [regular] bathing suit.\u201d \\nHistory will judge those who have monopolized the debate, given a platform to Islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability, the author of Destroy Islamic Fascism told Women in the World. \u201cThis is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today,\u201d she said. \\nAccording to the writer, who is repeatedly accused of bigotry, the \u201cIslamophobia ruse\u201d is driven by \u201cgreat ignorance\u201d and a lack of understanding of the culture of Islam and what Islam with a big \u2018I\u2019 is \u2014 \u201cthey ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within.\u201d \\n\u201cThe accomplices don\u2019t recognize the struggles playing out today in Arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people. No fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history. The people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability.\u201d \\nFor El Rhazoui the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to Islamic culture that decrees an Islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her \u201crace\u201d is the burqa. \u201cWe present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture. It is absolutely intolerable,\u201d she says. \\nSurvivor syndrome \\nWomen in the World asked El Rhazoui how she manages to keep up her spirits, and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since January 2015. \\n\u201cIt is a question people often ask me,\u201d she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice. \u201cBut when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death, you realize can put many things in perspective. \\n\u201cStraight after the attacks, like many of my colleagues I felt guilty for having stayed alive. I said to myself \u2018Those who are dead are dead for all our work, and some are dead when it wasn\u2019t even their work. But it was my work because I am a journalist and I am still here.\u2019 And then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome, which is normal when you survive a massacre like that. \\n\u201cAs you start to heal you say, \u2018I am lucky to be alive and if I am still here perhaps that is because I still have something to do.\u2019 I understood long before the attack on Charlie, when I engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in Morocco, that when you fight against totalitarianism, whether it is political or religious, you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living. We fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life. \\nZineb El Rhazoui (C) attends the funeral of French cartoonist and Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane \u201cCharb\u201d Charbonnier, on January 16, 2015 in Pontoise, outside Paris. (MARTIN BUREAU/AFP/Getty Images) \\nStill a day doesn\u2019t go past when she doesn\u2019t think of her old colleague Charb and their many heated discussions. \\n\u201cHe was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear. He was a true humanist who didn\u2019t fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd.\u201d \\nEl Rhazoui\u2019s deconstruction of Islam is also a defense of Muslims, she reasoned, as \u201csalvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it.\u201d \\n\u201cWe have to extend a hand to all these Muslims who are free people, who have questioned their heritage, and who are fighters for liberty, battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by Islamists,\u201d she says. \\nLife in a moving jail \\nSince January 2015, the survivor from Charlie Hebdo has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the Freedom Forum, in Europe and the U.S., under the protection assured by the French state and the countries that receive her. She says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed, because so many other writers and political figures around the world \u2014 and especially in Islamist-controlled or influenced countries \u2014 are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security. \\n\u201cI always find some spaces of freedom. There are always little escape hatches. Life continues!\u201d says the woman who has just written her second book since the Charlie attacks, and recently became a first-time mother, in what she laughingly called the surprise \u201cbaby boom\u201d at a publication that used to have \u201cone of the lowest birthrates in French media.\u201d \\n\u201cToday I wander around in a moving jail \u2014 it\u2019s a moving cage \u2014 but in reality I am more free in my head than those who threaten me. Because their cage is inside their head. They have this cage in their brain and even if they have freedom of movement it is their spirit and their reason and intelligence that is imprisoned. I am much freer than them.\u201d \\nFollow Emma-Kate Symons on Twitter @eksymons.'"}, "time": 1742562625.38875}
