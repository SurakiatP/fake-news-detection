John instantly thought of Robert\u2019s 18-year-old daughter, Sophie, who was just starting to forge her path in life. That\u2019s when this amazing uncle decided to step up in a seriously inspiring way: With Robert no longer there for her, John took it upon himself to discourage his niece\u2019s art career. \\nOkay, is someone cutting onions in here? Because we\u2019re getting just a little bit teary. \\nEver since his brother\u2019s passing, John has made it a point to call his niece every single Sunday evening to remind Sophie just how much her father loved her, how proud he\u2019d be if he could see her now, and how unstable a career in the arts can be compared to more traditional nine-to-five employment. Sophie\u2019s true passion in life has always been drawing and painting, but thanks to her selfless uncle\u2019s constant reminders that almost nobody actually ends up working their dream job, she\u2019s now just two years away from getting her BA in marketing! \\n\u201cI want Sophie to know that she can always depend on me,\u201d John explained, gazing tearfully at an old photograph of Robert holding his baby girl. \u201cBut she cannot depend on freelance income, especially in a field as oversaturated and undervalued as the arts. She\u2019s way too smart for that.\u201d \\nJohn has never faltered in his commitment to making sure his niece understands just how unrealistic it is to earn a living as an artist. Last summer, when Sophie landed an internship at a Brooklyn art gallery, John spent countless hours reminding her that New York is expensive, dangerous, and very far away from Ohio, before ultimately finding her a job doing administrative work for his friend instead. And when Sophie briefly considered getting a double major in studio art, her uncle pulled out all the stops, even going so far as to gain control of her late father\u2019s finances so that he could temporarily withhold the semester\u2019s tuition check until she changed her mind! \\nIncredible! Is there an Uncle of the Year award? Because this guy definitely just won it. \\nWhile nobody can ever take the place of Sophie\u2019s father, it is seriously heartwarming to see John step up to the plate like this. Sophie is so lucky to have an uncle she can always turn to for love, guidance, and stacks of brochures for MBA programs handed to her at every family holiday. Here\u2019s to you, John!'"}, "time": 1742563414.7804375}
