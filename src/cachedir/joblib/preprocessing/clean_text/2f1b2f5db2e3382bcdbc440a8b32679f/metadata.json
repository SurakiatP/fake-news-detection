Of course there is the fact that Western Europe has supported the US in their violent destruction of the Middle East over the past 20 years. Is it a guilty conscience that seems to appease the blatant criminal activity on behalf of some newcomers? Or are they George Soros puppets implanted into the judicial system that are at work?\\nRussia is a multicultural and multi-religious society, and has been for 1000 years. The law applies to everyone equally \u2013 whether you\u2019re a Crimean Tatar or a Slavic Russian \u2013 every Russian citizen is \u2018native\u2019 as such and subject to the same protocols.\\nA migrant has just raped a child in one of the European countries. The court found him \u201cNOT GUILTY\u201d based on two things: the migrant did not understand the language of his host country, and he did not understand that the boy \u2013 and it was a boy \u2013 didn\u2019t want this.\\nVladimir Putin was outraged when he heard about the incident and here\u2019s what he had to say:\\nIt doesn\u2019t fit into my head what on Earth they\u2019re thinking over there. This is the result of the dilution of national values [identity].\\nI can\u2019t even explain the rationale \u2013 is it a sense of guilt before the migrants? What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s not clear.\\nBut a society that cannot defend its children today has no tomorrow. It has no future.\\nSo relying on their [migration policy] experience is not the best thing to do, if I can be frank.\\nBut we have a 1000 year history of forming a multicultural society \u2013 our understanding of [these intricacies] is much deeper.\\n\\n'"}, "time": 1742562577.1625698}
