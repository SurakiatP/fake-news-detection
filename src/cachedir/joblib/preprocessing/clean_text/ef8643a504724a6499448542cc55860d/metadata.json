Sheriff Jim McDonnell of Los Angeles County said in a statement that the official, Tom Angel, his chief of staff, had resigned on Sunday. His resignation came days after The Los Angeles Times first reported on the emails, which the newspaper said were obtained under the state\u2019s open records act. \u201cThis incident is one that I find deeply troubling,\u201d Chief McDonnell said. \u201cDespite the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s many recent efforts to fortify public trust and enhance internal and external accountability and transparency, this incident reminds us that we and other law enforcement agencies still have work to do. \u201d Last Wednesday, The Times published 15 pages of email correspondence that contained jokes about Muslims, Catholics, Latinos,   and women. In one email, Mr. Angel asked a colleague, \u201cHow many virgins do Muslims get in heaven?\u201d In another, he forwarded a joke about a student who had done poorly on a biology exam. \u201cI was asked to name two things commonly found in cells. Apparently \u2018blacks\u2019 and \u2018Mexicans\u2019 were not the correct answers. \u201d The emails sent by Mr. Angel also criticized \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and supported the racial profiling of Muslims. They were sent between 2012 and 2013, when he was the No. 2 police official in Burbank, Calif. Chief McDonnell said on Sunday that the department would review its training curriculum and hold meetings with community groups to brainstorm ways to improve its \u201cunderstanding\u201d and \u201cappreciation\u201d of the racial, ethnic and religious diversity of the area it serves. He also said the department would begin conducting random checks of its employees\u2019 email accounts. \u201cWe are only as effective as the relationships, credibility and trust we have with our community,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564283.529544}
