[The episode, titled \u201cWhat Will We Do This Time About Adam?\u201d shows Hannah, well along in her pregnancy, reevaluating her decision to be a single mother.  \u201cOh, God. Hannah, this is gonna be a real mindf**k for me if you wanna get an abortion right now,\u201d Elijah tells her. \u201cI mean   \u2026     I\u2019ll do it. I think there\u2019s about two doctors in America that do it at this stage in your pregnancy, but I\u2019ll find them. \u201d Writing at Newsbusters, Dawn Slusher observes some of the \u201cfake\u201d information about   abortion that Girls serves up in this episode  \u2014   first and foremost being Elijah\u2019s reference to the difficulty in finding an abortionist to perform one: \u201cThere are not just \u2018two doctors in America\u2019 who will \u2018do it at this stage.\u2019 There are actually 162 abortion clinics that perform abortions after 20 weeks. Secondly, most don\u2019t realize just how easy getting a   abortion is legally, given the loose definition of \u201chealth\u201d that was buried in Roe v. Wade\u2019s companion case, Doe v. Bolton: \u2018  \u2026     all factors  \u2014   physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman\u2019s age  \u2014   relevant to the wellbeing of the patient. All these factors may relate to health.\u2019 All Hannah needs to say is that she has a headache, is too young, too tired, or is having anxiety about having a baby and she can legally get an abortion at any point in her pregnancy. \u201d At the federal level, abortion is still legal in the United States up until the time of birth, although more states are  enacting laws that restrict the procedure. The abortion industry has fought against any attempts by states to restrict abortion or to mandate health and safety standards in abortion clinics. Its allies in the liberal media portray abortion as a safe procedure that is welcomed by women. In its recent report titled \u201cUnsafe: The Public Health Crisis in America\u2019s Abortion Clinics Endangers Women,\u201d Americans United for Life (AUL) demonstrates in its analysis the many state officials who look the other way when it comes to inspections of abortion clinics. The organization asserts: \u201cImportantly, even limiting the scope of our investigation to the last eight years, efforts to discern the true state of abortion practices was stymied by a dearth of protective laws in a number of states, a lack of reporting in others, and limited public availability of information on abortion providers in still more states. \u201d \u201cWe can easily deduce, therefore, that the epidemic of substandard abortion practice is worse than even these pages show,\u201d AUL states.'"}, "time": 1742564580.6714861}
