Limbaugh said while the media still won\u2019t warm up to Trump, it was what his supporters wanted to see, which was a willingness to tout his achievements and take on some of the claims from the media. \u201cYou know it is hard to say  \u2014   you get caught up in the moment,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cBut this was one of the most effective press conferences I have ever seen. The press is going to hate him even more after this. Don\u2019t misunderstand. When I say effective, I\u2019m talking about rallying people who voted for him to stay with him. He made a point  \u2014   \u2018What chaos? You\u2019re reporting chaos. We\u2019re not in chaos. We\u2019re a   machine. We got one of the smoothest running machines in the history of machines. We got one of the best administrations in the history of administrations. \u2019\u201d \u201cAnd he rattled off the achievements they\u2019ve had here that the media is not reporting because they\u2019re so focused on whether or not Trump worked with Russia to screw Hillary out of the presidency,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd he was reassuring the people he\u2019s on top of everything. Nothing has changed. Everything he campaigned on, he is doing. All he is doing is fulfilling campaign promises. And of course, the Democrats don\u2019t like him. Of course, the media don\u2019t like him. It isn\u2019t going to stop him. \u201d (  Daily Rushbo) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563614.6747603}
