Trump: He\u2019s a part of the political \u201cestablishment\u201d and is not really a \u201cpopulist\u201d president. [\u201cLet me just say about his address, it was populist, but I\u2019m worried he\u2019s using populist rhetoric to cover up a   agenda,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday. \u201cIf you look at his Cabinet appointments, so many of them are not populist, but  . \u201d  Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) a leading candidate for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and hardcore progressive leftist, actually Tweeted that Trump is not really a populist. Ellison\u2019s argument is because President Trump raised Federal Housing Administration mortgage fees back to the levels they were at before former President Barack Obama, on his way out of office, slashed them. Wonder whether @realDonaldTrump was economic populist? Here\u2019s your answer: first day as president, he raises FHA mortgage insurance fees.  \u2014   Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) January 22, 2017,  Schumer similarly hammered Trump for this, but even the   and highly liberal editorial board of the Washington Post \u2014  which is funded by Trump detractor and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014  stood up for Trump in this regard with a scathing editorial bashing Democrats for criticizing Trump over this. \u201cOne of the Obama administration\u2019s final actions was to slash the fee that mortgage borrowers must pay for Federal Housing Administration insurance on eligible loans,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote. \u201cOne of President Trump\u2019s first actions Jan. 20 was to suspend that move pending further study. Democrats accused him of heartlessly hiking costs for the FHA\u2019s   and   clientele by $500\\u2009per year on a typical $200, 000 loan. \u201d They quoted Schumer\u2019s statement, which accused Trump of hypocrisy on populism and standing up for American workers and families. \u201cOne hour after talking about helping working people and ending the cabal in Washington that hurts people, he signs a regulation that makes it more expensive for new homeowners to buy mortgages,\u201d Schumer said. But, the Washington Post shot down the Democratic leader as fast as he shot at Trump, in just two words: \u201cWell, no. \u201d The Post proceeded to dismantle Schumer\u2019s and Ellison\u2019s arguments against Trump. But Schumer and Ellison aren\u2019t the only Democrats trying out the new talking points accusing Trump of being part of the establishment: Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) is also calling the notion that Trump is   \u201cabsurd. \u201d Sanders\u2019 argument? That Trump\u2019s cabinet is too rich and successful for him to really be  . It\u2019d be funny if it wasn\u2019t so absurd: Trump, a billionaire, surrounded at his inauguration by billionaires, says he\u2019s  .  \u2014   Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 23, 2017,  The Democratic Party is in tough shape after getting swept in the 2016 elections. They lost the White House, failed to pick up majorities in either the U. S. House or U. S. Senate, and saw Republicans retain a majority of governorships and bolster GOP control of statehouses nationwide. Now, they can\u2019t even elect a DNC chair to succeed interim chairwoman Donna Brazile \u2014  who along with   Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) was caught aiding failed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primaries against Sanders in an unfair manner \u2014  without serious problems. Ellison is just one of many candidates for the post, and along fellow candidate former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez and the others, wants to take the Democratic Party even further left away from standing up for American workers \u2014  leaving Trump an opening where labor union leaders like the  \u2019s Richard Trumka and the Teamsters\u2019 Jimmy Hoffa among others are praising Trump while their    members support Trump in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and elsewhere.'"}, "time": 1742563826.9973977}
