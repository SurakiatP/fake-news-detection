VN:F [1.9.22_1171] \\nIf the synthetic estrogen BPA is linked to billions of dollars\u2019 worth of medical problems a year, why is it still allowed in the food supply?   Why BPA Hasn\u2019t Been Banned? \\n  \\n\u201cThe number of new chemicals is increasing exponentially\u201d\u2014we\u2019re talking 12,000 new substances a day. Yet, data aren\u2019t available on the hazards of even some of the high volume chemicals. BPA is one of the highest volume chemicals, with billions of pounds produced each year. And, studies have \u201craised concerns about its possible implication in the [cause] of some chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, reproductive disorders, cardiovascular diseases, birth defects, chronic respiratory and kidney diseases and breast cancer.\u201d \\nA new study on the health implications of BPA comes out nearly every week. BPA was first developed over a hundred years ago as a synthetic estrogen. But it wasn\u2019t until the 1950s that industry realized it could be used to make polycarbonate plastic, and it rapidly became one of the most used chemicals worldwide, even though it was recognized to have hormonal effects. About a billion pounds are also used to line food and beverage cans\u2014especially, it seems, in tuna and condensed soups. \\nAnd now, we basically all have BPA in our bodies, and our children\u2019s bodies. But, not to worry; the government says up to 50 a day is safe; 50 micrograms per kilogram. And, even those working in Chinese BPA factories don\u2019t get exposed to more than like 70 times lower than that safety limit. Okay, then, why did exposure seem to affect the male workers\u2019 sperm counts? \\nIn the U.S., the general population only gets less than like a thousand times lower than the safety limit. Yet, still, we seem to be seeing \u201cadverse effects on thyroid function, weight control, blood sugar control, cardiovascular disease, liver function, and immune function\u201d\u2014even at those incredibly low doses. So, \u201c[t]he fact that there are significant adverse effects in populations exposed to BPA at concentrations [thousands of] times lower than the [official tolerable daily limit] indicates that the safe exposure to BPA may be much lower than previously thought in humans.\u201d Yet, the limit hasn\u2019t been changed. It\u2019s been banned from baby bottles and sippy cups, but nearly unlimited doses are still apparently okay for everyone else. What\u2019s the disconnect here? \\nIt has to do with the fascinating world of low-dose effects of hormone-disrupting chemicals. \u201cFor decades, [these chemicals] \u201chave challenged traditional concepts in toxicology\u201d\u2014particularly the old adage that it\u2019s \u201cthe dose makes the poison,\u201d the concept \u201cthat lower exposures to a hazardous compound will, therefore, always generate lower risks.\u201d That\u2019s \u201cthe core assumption underlying [our] system of chemical-safety testing.\u201d They start dosing lab animals with super high amounts, and then keep lowering the dose until whatever adverse effects disappear; then, add a safety buffer, and assume everything below that dose should be okay, assuming the curve looks like this. You know, the higher the dose, the higher the effect. But, hormone-disrupting chemicals can have all sorts of \u201ccurious curves.\u201d Basically, how could something have more of an effect at a lower dose? \\nThink about a hormone, and its receptors in the body. At low levels of the hormone, like going from 0 to 1, the receptors can fill up quickly. But, once they\u2019re almost all filled up, going from 4 to 5, adding really high doses may not change things much. Let\u2019s use an actual BPA example. This was a study to see if BPA suppressed an obesity-protective hormone in fat samples taken from breast reduction and tummy tuck patients. As you can see, at a hundred nanomoles of BPA (I feel like a weatherman here!), but at a hundred nanomoles of BPA, you can see hormone levels are no lower than they are at 0 BPA. And, since most people have levels like between 1 and 20, then BPA must be safe. But, here\u2019s the actual graph. So, no suppression at 0; no suppression at 100. But, right where levels are in people\u2019s bodies, BPA appears to cut hormone release nearly in half. \\nAs the world\u2019s oldest, largest, and most active organization devoted to research on hormones concluded, \u201ceven infinitesimally low levels of exposure\u2014indeed, any level of exposure at all\u2014may cause [problems],\u201d nearly three billion dollars\u2019 worth of problems every year, just counting the estimated effects of BPA on childhood obesity and heart disease alone. \\nNow, there are alternatives that the industry could use; the problem, though, is that they may cost two cents more.
