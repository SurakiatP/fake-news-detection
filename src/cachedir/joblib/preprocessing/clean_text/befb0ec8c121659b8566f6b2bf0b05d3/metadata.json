An M. B. A. from H. B. S. as those in the know refer to it, has long been the ultimate Good Housekeeping stamp of approval on any r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook  \u2014   and the list goes on and on. The number of Fortune 500 chief executives who earned their business degrees at Harvard is three times the total from the next most popular business school, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. It is hard to overstate the school\u2019s influence on corporate America. That\u2019s why a new, exhaustive history of the school is causing a stir before it is even out. The book, \u201cThe Golden Passport,\u201d by the veteran business journalist Duff McDonald, is a richly reported indictment of the school as a leading reason that corporate America is disdained by much of the country. \u201cThe Harvard Business School became (and remains) so intoxicated with its own importance that it blithely assumed away one of the most important questions it could ask, which was whether the capitalist system it was uniquely positioned to help improve was designed properly for the long term,\u201d Mr. McDonald writes in the book, to be released in two weeks. His answer? \u201cWith economic inequality at a   high and meaningful progress on climate change and other social and environmental issues embarrassingly paltry, the answer to that question is obvious. It is not. \u201d Citing a report from the Aspen Institute, Mr. McDonald explains that \u201cwhen students enter business school, they believe that the purpose of a corporation is to produce goods and services for the benefit of society. \u201d \u201cWhen they graduate,\u201d he continues, \u201cthey believe that it is to maximize shareholder value. \u201d Mr. McDonald brilliantly tells the story of the school\u2019s creation in 1908, when its mission was to educate the next generation of business managers. Edwin Gay, its first dean, defined business as the \u201cactivity of making things to sell at a profit  \u2014   decently. \u201d But, the author says, somewhere during the   something went very wrong: \u201cThe money got too good. \u201d The money he refers to is the tsunami of job offers that Harvard students received from Wall Street, and the funding the school raked in from its   alumni. In fairness, Harvard Business School makes an easy punching bag, given its stature as the top feeder for big business. This is hardly the first time the institution has been criticized. And it is too much to paint all   alumni as being ethically challenged, as Mr. McDonald appears to imply. Indeed, many of the school\u2019s vaunted alumni are among the most talented executives in the country, and many are trying to think about stakeholders holistically. Yet in example after example, Mr. McDonald sets out his thesis that money and influence have distorted both the school\u2019s curriculum and the worldview espoused by its professors, who themselves are on the payroll of corporate America as   advisers and consultants. \u201cFor a whole semester, for example, the school is basically bought and paid for by the consulting firms,\u201d Mr. McDonald writes, quoting Casey Gerald, a member of the class of 2014 whose rousing speech at the school went viral on YouTube. The moneyed interests of employers prompted Harvard, Mr. McDonald contends, to hire the economist Michael C. Jensen, a financial economics specialist, in 1985. Mr. Jensen is famous for advocating the \u201c  theory\u201d  \u2014   the idea that investors, rather than corporate managers or the board of directors, should have the most influence. Mr. McDonald describes Mr. Jensen\u2019s arrival as \u201cthe moment of peak paradox for H. B. S. ,\u201d contending that Mr. Jensen\u2019s \u201cideologically driven hijacking of the study of finance served as a cynical repudiation of everything that had come before him at the school. \u201d With the elevation of Mr. Jensen, Mr. McDonald writes, \u201cH. B. S. had nurtured the professional manager from his birth and then helped to kill him. \u201d The book is filled with anecdotal evidence of Mr. McDonald\u2019s argument. In once instance, he draws from a paper Mr. Jensen   in which the professor recounted a   story about the playwright George Bernard Shaw. As the story goes, Shaw had asked \u201can actress if she would sleep with him for a million dollars,\u201d Mr. McDonald writes. \u201cWhen she agreed, he changed his offer to $10, to which she responded with outrage, asking him what kind of woman he thought she was. His reply: \u2018We\u2019ve already established that. Now we\u2019re just haggling about the price. \u2019\u201d To Mr. McDonald, Harvard teaches its students that \u201cwe\u2019re all whores. \u201d Continuing his train of logic, he writes: \u201cIf everybody assumes you\u2019re a whore, you might as well grab as much money as possible while you\u2019re still in demand. \u201d Mr. McDonald\u2019s book also makes a provocative argument that Harvard Business School, and, by extension, the American business school complex, is responsible for    compensation schemes for top management. He quotes Julian Birkinshaw, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the London Business School, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that business schools are complicit\u201d in the exorbitant pay packages in boardrooms. \u201cWe benefit financially from it as well,\u201d the quotation continues. \u201cClearly, the fees we can charge M. B. A. students are correlated with the salaries they can get when they go get jobs. \u201d In the end, Mr. McDonald acknowledges that \u201cone shouldn\u2019t expect Harvard Business School to be teaching courses on how to overthrow the capitalist economy. \u201d But Mr. McDonald does raise enough salient questions that maybe the school should be asking: Should we create a case study about ourselves?'"}, "time": 1742563689.1440926}
