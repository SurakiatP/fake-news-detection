While most voters expect Hillary Clinton to continue many of his policies if she wins, a sizable majority of her current supporters would vote for Obama instead if the rules allowed it. \\nA new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey shows that 70% of Likely U.S. Voters who support Clinton in the election say they\u2019d vote for Obama if it was a legal option. Just 11% of Republican Donald Trump\u2019s voters agree. (To see survey question wording, click here .) \\nAmong all Likely Voters, 41% say that if Obama was legally allowed to run for a third term in office, they would vote for him over Clinton and Trump. Just over half (52%) still say they would not vote for him in that case. \\nEarlier this year before the presidential nominees were decided , 31% said they would vote for Obama if he legally could seek a third term, but twice as many (62%) said they would not support him. Those findings were little changed from last year after Obama commented about winning a third term in a speech in Africa.'"}, "time": 1742562280.1317458}
