The changing role of third-party candidates . A renewed focus on racial inequality . And of course, the trove of information given to us by WikiLeaks. \\nAs we look toward Tuesday, the finale of an increasingly tight race to the White House, we at Truthdig turn to our readers to ask: What was the most significant story of the 2016 election season?
