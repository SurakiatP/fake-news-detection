Just the sort of genius he is known for. \\nHomer sang these prophetic words while holding a pig upside down, walking it along the ceiling: \\n\"Spider Pig! Spider Pig! Does whatever a spider pig does!Can he swing from a web? No, he can\\'t. He\\'s a pig.\" \\nAn expedition in the deep Amazon rain forest found an actual spider-pig. It\\'s about 1 \u00bd feet long, has eight legs, and has retractable sticky, suction cup-like extensions on its hooves. \\nWhen walking on the forest floor spider-pig uses four legs at a time. It uses all 8 legs when climbing. \\nSpider-pig can climb trees and spin a web but is too big to sit in it. And the pig doesn\\'t want to eat what\\'s caught in the web anyways. Scientists believe it just catches things for entertainment. \\nSeveral cities currently compete to bring the first spider-pig to their local zoo including Springfield, Vermont; Springfield, Illinois; and Springfield, Oregon.
