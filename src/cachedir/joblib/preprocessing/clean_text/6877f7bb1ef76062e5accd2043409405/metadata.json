Mr. Wilders, whose party leads in national polls, posted a video clip of his comments on Twitter. Mr. Wilders, who was convicted in December of inciting discrimination after leading an   chant at a political rally in 2014, has vowed to end Muslim immigration and shutter the country\u2019s mosques if elected prime minister in a general election on March 15. His party has 12 of the 150 seats in the lower house of Parliament. But while ahead in the polls, Mr. Wilders\u2019s lead is narrowing after recent gains by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, a   conservative. Even if his party places first in the election, questions remain about whether Mr. Wilders would be able to successfully form a governing coalition. Mr. Wilders is one of several European nationalist politicians who is appealing to disillusioned voters, embittered by immigration and economic inequality. If elected, Mr. Wilders has promised to remove the Netherlands from the European Union. The triumph of President Trump  \u2014   whose   policies and   comments has been heralded by Mr. Wilders  \u2014   and the successful campaign to extract Britain from the European Union have galvanized   parties and emboldened politicians across Europe.'"}, "time": 1742562995.391459}
