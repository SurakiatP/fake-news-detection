{"duration": 0.1362452507019043, "input_args": {"text": "'Starting in the 1970s, eight prosecutors in the Justice Department\u2019s Public Integrity Section set up a standing meeting. Once a year, they would gather in the deputy attorney general\u2019s conference room and run an elaborate pool for the N. C. A. A. men\u2019s basketball tournament. \u201cWe mostly followed the law,\u201d said Reid Weingarten, one of the pool\u2019s charter members. The pool lasted decades, surviving long after the colleagues had left for other jobs. Like most N. C. A. A. tournament pools, it brought friends together for good   fun. Any financial stakes paled in comparison to the competitive ones. Participants got carried away with preselection research. And they were merciless in lambasting one another\u2019s pet predilections. \u201cEric\u201d  \u2014   that would be Eric H. Holder Jr. the future attorney general  \u2014   \u201cwould always pick U. C. L. A. because he was a Kareem guy,\u201d Weingarten said, referring to Kareem  \u2019s alma mater. \u201cAnd he would always pick the Ivy League team, because he went to Columbia. \u201d But what made the bracket truly unusual was its structure. The participants did not pick games rather, they drafted teams. (Random selection dictated the drafting order.) Owning the team that won it all merited the largest reward, of course, but it also was worth something to have a team that made the Final Four or the   team to make the round of 16. This was not, in other words, your ordinary office pool. \u201cI find blind pool picking tedious, ridiculous and not fun,\u201d Weingarten said. That is not to say there is anything wrong with simple pools millions of Americans take part in one every March, often merely for the prize of office or family bragging rights. In fact, one recently existed in a place even higher than the Justice Department. For the previous six N. C. A. A. tournaments, Kyle Lierman, then of the White House Office of Public Engagement, ran BOTUS  \u2014   Bracket of the United States  \u2014   for hundreds of members of President Barack Obama\u2019s staff. (He will run the pool again this year it has been rechristened BOTUS 44.) There were no financial stakes, Lierman said, and the president\u2019s bracket, publicly filled out on ESPN, was automatically entered every year. \u201cHe did well a couple years,\u201d Lierman said. \u201cOther years, not so well. \u201d The N. C. A. A. tournament, which kicks off Tuesday, is the Super Bowl of sports wagering. Actually, it is the Super Bowl twice over. The American Gaming Association, a trade group for the casino industry, estimated that Americans will wager more than $10 billion on the tournament this year, most of it illegally, compared with $4. 7 billion on the Super Bowl. And that figure does not include the multitudes of office pools, with their $5 or $10 entry fees. Officially, the N. C. A. A. opposes \u201call forms of legal and illegal sports wagering. \u201d \u201cDespite the N. C. A. A.\u2019s protests against gambling,\u201d said Geoff Freeman, the chief executive of the gaming association, which supports the broad legalization of sports wagering, \u201cthey\u2019ve created the biggest gambling event in American history. They wisely did it with great marketing, tremendous use of the bracket and infiltration into the American cultural lifestyle. \u201d Most pools are straightforward: Take a blank bracket, predict winners for every game and submit it before the first one tips off. But for a certain breed of fan, like those aforementioned anticorruption lawyers, the standard     pool is not enough. Several have devised sophisticated, even byzantine alterations on the theme. Noah Chestnut, a product manager at the sports website Bleacher Report, crafted a   pool several years ago that is similar to the one used by the lawyers. In his pool, drafting is  . Entrants are allocated a $100 budget that must be spent on four to six teams whoever offers the most for a given team buys it. (When Kentucky entered the 2015 tournament undefeated, the successful draftee paid $96 for the privilege of selecting the Wildcats, who lost in the semifinals.) \u201cI\u2019ve always preferred to draft to everything else in life,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually enjoy the games as much as the time before the games. \u201d A common tweak in irregular pools is to adjust how many points a participant receives for picking an underdog in order to make every game closer to an effective tossup. Picking a 14th seed that wins its first game, some reason, should be worth more than picking a No. 3 seed that holds serve. Chestnut, for example, weighted the scoring so that additional points were available when a team upset a favorite: 3 points, for instance, when a No. 10 beat a No. 7. And The Wall Street Journal reported several years ago on a biostatistician who used sophisticated mathematical formulas to determine point values for every matchup based on how previous, similar matchups had turned out. Similarly, in the early 1980s, Stephen Brown raided the microfiche at the University of Virginia where he was a graduate student. Armed with pencil and paper, he consulted past bracket results from The New York Times and, based on previous outcomes, calculated upset bonus points, which increased as the bracket narrowed. \u201cI was supposed to be writing my dissertation on an   poet named Edward Young,\u201d said Brown, now an English professor at Rhode Island College. The bonus points, though, were secondary to Brown\u2019s core innovation:    picking. Instead of filling out an entire bracket before the first game, participants picked games in the second round after knowing the results in the first, and so on. The structure keeps more participants in the running, as anyone with a bad first round, say, can make up for it with a good second round  \u2014   particularly if there are more upsets, and thus more available upset bonus points. \u201cI never liked the idea of filling out the brackets,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt makes so much more sense, and would take more judgment and skill, if you knew who was actually playing every game. \u201d Brown\u2019s pool survives to this day, administered by his nephew. So does a   offshoot centered in the Washington area. (Full disclosure: The offshoot is this reporter\u2019s annual pool of choice.) Finally, for those who prefer getting ready for the party to the party itself, Bryan Cimorelli\u2019s pool, the Conference Tournament Challenge, is for you. It covers not the one N. C. A. A. championship tournament, but the 32 Division I conference tournaments, which this season comprised 294 games, per his calculation. Each tournament is treated like the N. C. A. A. tournament, with point values increasing each round. Additional points are awarded for upsets, calculated by a method too exasperating to explain here. Values are additionally multiplied depending on how prominent the conference is: Conferences like the Southwestern Athletic are the baseline, while points in the Ivy League are multiplied by 3. 5 the Atlantic 10 by 4. 5 and the six power conferences by 5. \u201cI like things that are really complicated and take a lot of thought,\u201d said Cimorelli, perhaps stating the obvious. Cimorelli, whose day job in budgeting also involves spreadsheets, emails a preview every morning and a recap every night to ensure his pool\u2019s 40 participants remain engaged. A recent preview was more than 15, 000 words. It informed competitors that only one had picked   Richmond to win the Atlantic 10, discussed coaching seniority in the Southeastern Conference and made the observation that while more than half the pool had picked Rice to upset   Paso in one game, none had the Owls reaching the Conference USA final. On Sunday, the C. T. C. ended and, soon after, the selection committee handed down the N. C. A. A. tournament bracket. For Cimorelli, it always is perhaps the year\u2019s biggest letdown. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to look at a bracket,\u201d he said. \u201cI fill one out because it\u2019s my sports fan\u2019s obligation, but after 300 games in 13 days, I get to the actual tournament and I\u2019m like, This is boring. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563164.1732943}
