That\u2019s what many scientists, analysts and activists are saying after heavy rains in southern Louisiana have killed at least 11 people and forced tens of thousands of residents from their homes, in the latest in a series of extreme floods that have occurred in the United States over the last two years. That increase in heavy rainfall and the resultant flooding \u201cis consistent with what we expect to see in the future if you look at climate models,\u201d said David Easterling, a director at the National Centers for Environmental Information, which is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cNot just in the U. S. but in many other parts of the world as well. \u201d The flooding in Louisiana is the eighth event since May of last year in which the amount of rainfall in an area in a specified window of time matches or exceeds the NOAA predictions for an amount of precipitation that will occur once every five hundred years, or has a 0. 2 percent chance of occurring in any given year. Louisiana joins five other states, most of them in the South, that have experienced deadly flooding in the last 15 months, including Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina and West Virginia. In the last three months alone, floods in Maryland, West Virginia and Louisiana have combined to kill dozens of people and damage tens of thousands of homes and vehicles. The National Weather Service reports that parts of Louisiana have received as much as 31 inches of rain in the last week, a number Dr. Easterling called \u201cpretty staggering,\u201d and one that exceeds an amount of precipitation that his center predicts will occur once every thousand years in the area. Dr. Easterling said that those sorts of estimates were predicated on the idea that the climate was stable, a principle that has become outdated. The third National Climate Assessment, released in 2014 by the United States Global Change Research Program, showed that \u201cthe amount of rain falling in very heavy precipitation events\u201d had been significantly above average since 1991. However, the research did not identify the South as one of the areas of greatest concern the increase was found to be greatest in the Northeast, Midwest and Upper Great Plains regions of the United States. Some climate researchers warned Tuesday that it was too early to explain why so much of the country has faced sudden flooding. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to attribute things like this without a larger body of evidence,\u201d said Barry D. Keim, the Louisiana state climatologist. \u201cAnd, of course, the question keeps coming up: How large does that body of evidence have to get?\u201d But others said that the situation was quite clear. \u201cThis is exactly what scientists have been predicting,\u201d said the climate activist Bill McKibben. \u201cThe basic physics are simple: Warm air holds more water vapor, something that is turning out to be one of the most important facts of the 21st century. \u201d \u201cAnd while Louisiana was flooding, there were also huge flood events underway in Moscow (biggest rains in 129 years of  ) the Sudan, Manila, and probably plenty of other places,\u201d he added. For the last four years, the American Meteorological Society has attempted to explain how climate change has influenced individual extreme weather events. However, that type of analysis, known as event attribution, is not yet available for the flooding in Louisiana. Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit, who focuses on climate change\u2019s effect on water resources, said that state and local governments would have to change their approaches to keeping citizens safe from flooding. \u201cIf you look across all our natural disaster policies, they\u2019re predicated on the wrong assumption that our flood risk in the future looks identical to our flood risk in the past,\u201d he said. He said that initiatives like the National Flood Insurance Program, which focuses on helping people rebuild in areas that have been flooded, were increasingly \u201cuntenable,\u201d given sea level rise. A report released earlier this month by the real estate sales company Zillow predicted that almost 1. 9 million homes, worth a combined $882 billion, would be lost to the rising sea levels  \u2014   and the flooding likely to follow  \u2014   that climate scientists expect to see by the year 2100. \u201cWhen Zillow starts warning about sea level rise, it may be time to start worrying about sea level rise,\u201d Mr. Moore said.'"}, "time": 1742562205.3727043}
