The deal would include Timer Warner\u2019s popular brands HBO and CNN, and force other distributors to negotiate with AT&T for programming licenses. \u00a9 REUTERS/ Brendan McDermid/Files \"This merger represents a gross concentration of power that runs counter to the public good and should be blocked,\" Sanders wrote to Hesse, who heads the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division. \\nSanders argued the proposed merger would shrink the media landscape and stifle competition in the United States. \\nSanders explained that the plan would give AT&T control over both content and distribution, which he alleged would give the company less incentive to provide additional choices to consumers. \\nThe merger has to be approved by the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division and other US federal regulators. ...'"}, "time": 1742564281.8025405}
