Trump, Americans have debated the ramifications of the arrival of \u201ckompromat\u201d as a feature of American politics. But those debates  \u2014   for example, over the ethics of publishing the dossier  \u2014   have often framed this practice as little more than a political form of blackmail, and one particular to Russia. In fact, kompromat is more than an individual piece of damaging information: It is a broader attempt to manufacture public cynicism and confusion in ways that target not just one individual but an entire society. And although this practice tends to be associated with Russia  \u2014   the word kompromat is a portmanteau of the Russian words for \u201ccompromising\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d  \u2014   it is a common feature of authoritarian and semiauthoritarian nations around the world. Specific leaks may take aim at powerful individuals, but in the longer term, kompromat serves the interests of the powerful, which is why it is often a tool of autocrats. By eroding the very idea of a shared reality, and by spreading apathy and confusion among a public that learns to distrust leaders and institutions alike, kompromat undermines a society\u2019s ability to hold the powerful to account and ensure the proper functioning of government. When Katy E. Pearce, a professor of communications at the University of Washington in Seattle, began studying access to technology in Azerbaijan, she expected to focus her research on how it could be a positive tool for promoting political freedom. But she changed her tack after encountering widespread fear of the ways that the government could use technology as a tool of repression. \u201cWhen I was interviewing people, it kept on coming up and coming up,\u201d she said. Kompromat is \u201ca very cheap and easy way for the regime to demonstrate its power, and to harass people in a very visible way,\u201d she added. That was a danger and a deterrent for the young activists she spoke to. But individual targets of kompromat are not its only victims, Professor Pearce said. It also harms society by diminishing public trust. Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King\u2019s College London, wrote on Twitter that disinformation campaigns have \u201coften deliberately blended accurate and forged details\u201d to sow distrust and confusion. If the news media and public figures publicize lies, they lose their credibility as trustworthy sources of information. \u201cThere\u2019s no reliable truth to rest upon,\u201d Professor Pearce said. \u201cEvery piece of information you get is \u2018possibly true, possibly false. \u2019\u201d Degrading that trust can be deeply damaging. While in Russia in 2015, I was struck by how many of the people I met saw the world through a lens that I began to call the \u201cprudent hypothetical. \u201d They reacted to all information, whether from official sources or thirdhand rumors, as if it might be true. I came to realize that it was a   impulse, a way to prepare for any potential outcome in an unpredictable, unreliable world. But they were also careful not to rely on that information, lest it turn out to be a fabrication. They trusted only the facts they had verified themselves, and only the people to whom they had close personal ties. I had seen the same thing in Guatemala several years earlier. There, spreading lies and salacious gossip to discredit one\u2019s enemies is referred to as a \u201ccampa\u00f1a negra,\u201d or a black campaign, rather than kompromat. But the result was the same: Public trust had been so eroded that lies were equally capable of destroying the honest and rehabilitating the criminal. When it appeared that Yasm\u00edn Barrios, the judge presiding over the trial of Gen. Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt, Guatemala\u2019s former dictator, might convict him of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013, a campaign of coordinated leaks and rumors portrayed her as a corrupt agent of foreign governments, willing to discredit her country in exchange for personal gain. Leaks and rumors attacked Judge Barrios personally, but by extension, they also undermined the credibility of the justice system in which she worked. For example, the news media reported that the judge had been seen dining with \u201cforeign women\u201d at a restaurant in Guatemala City, and suggested that this was evidence of foreign influence on her rulings. In fact, the \u201cforeigners\u201d were Judge Barrios\u2019s Guatemalan mother, her neighbor, and a nun who was a friend of the family. But the rumors had their desired effect: They discredited not only Judge Barrios but also the genocide trial. The Guatemalans I met knew that the stories they heard through the news media might be part of disinformation campaigns. But lacking better options, many still saw the world through the lens of the prudent hypothetical, viewing everything as possible and nothing as certain. When General R\u00edos Montt was eventually convicted, many saw him as a victim of foreign machinations rather than a perpetrator of genocide and crimes against humanity. (His conviction was later vacated on procedural grounds.) Professor Pearce said she saw parallels between the use of kompromat overseas and recent news in the United States. Although the Trump dossier purported to be a warning about kompromat elsewhere, she said, it could also be seen as a form of kompromat itself. She listed the parallels to what she had seen in her research: Its content is damaging but unverified. Its distribution was multilayered, with a website  \u2014   in this case, BuzzFeed  \u2014   publishing the unverified material and other outlets amplifying its impact by reporting on the ensuing controversy. The document also fostered uncertainty and division. Masha Gessen, a Russian journalist, wrote in a recent opinion column in The New York Times that the release of the dossier had allowed Mr. Trump to say that \u201cthere was no such thing as truth, only a battle of opinions proffered by different actors, each of whom strives to be loudest. \u201d For some Americans, the dossier sowed concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s vulnerability to Russian influence. Others saw its publication as evidence that Mr. Trump was the victim of a disinformation campaign. That may ultimately be to Mr. Trump\u2019s benefit if   allegations against him arise in the future. Americans were similarly divided in their views on the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer system. When Russian hackers leaked emails stolen from the committee, some saw it as evidence that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a victim of foreign machinations, while others viewed the documents\u2019 content as confirmation that Mrs. Clinton was unreliable and dishonest. The leaks distracted from more substantive campaign issues and fueled public distrust and rancor. Many people in the United States traditionally see the leak of confidential documents by   like Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s release of the Pentagon Papers, as a way to hold the powerful to account. We tend to believe that transparency serves the public good, and secrecy the interests of the powerful. Such a belief presumes that there is a fixed quantity of hidden information out there that the news media is or is not revealing. But in a kompromat society, incriminating material, real and fake, will be manufactured as needed to serve a political purpose. To smear a president, undermine a judge or sow distrust in an institution or process, all someone needs to do is create a set of documents salacious enough to attract discussion, persuade some corner of the web to publish them and then wait for the resulting controversy to be reported as news. That does not hold the powerful to account. And worse, it undermines the institutions that are supposed to do so. In the United States, Professor Pearce said, \u201cgrabbing on and holding to the truth is becoming more challenging. \u201d If kompromat becomes a more widespread tactic, public trust will erode even further. \u201cA lot of the things that are good about the U. S. are because we have this kind of   scaffolding,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in an environment where I\u2019m having to really be skeptical of everything, like people in authoritarian regimes have to be. \u201d \u201cLiving like that is horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is exhausting. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562930.664942}
