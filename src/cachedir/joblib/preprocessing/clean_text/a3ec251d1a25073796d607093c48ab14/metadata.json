The Catholic church won\u2019t declare a person a saint until after their death, but if this extraordinary statement is true, maybe a miracle of this magnitude deserves an exception? [Dunham revealed the news on the Howard Stern Show, during which the actress went through her tired   routine of explaining that promising to move to Canada was \u201cjust a joke. \u201d She also said Hillary Clinton was \u201cthe best qualified candidate we\u2019ve ever had. \u201d  But in the middle of her schtick, an amazing revelation emerged. Lena said \u201cDonald Trump became president and I stopped being able to eat food  \u2026    Everyone\u2019s been asking like, \u2018What have you been doing?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, try   pain and devastation and hopelessness and you, too, will lose weight. \u201d Now that we\u2019ve collectively pulled ourselves together, stopped guffawing and picked the sick out of our keyboards, let\u2019s unpack that statement for a moment. None of us really believes that Lena Dunham can stay off cheeseburgers for long. But if it is true, Trump\u2019s achievement is on par with curing the sick and returning sight to the blind. You\u2019ll recall that when Lena made disgusting comments about abortion, her excuse was that they were said as part of a \u201cdelusional girl persona\u201d she \u201coften inhabits. \u201d Perhaps these weight loss comments were made as part of another persona, one that doesn\u2019t want to die lonely and far too young due to obesity and feminism  \u2026     but I repeat myself. I\u2019ve had my   with Dunham. Without a doubt she is one of the best examples of how feminism attracts ugly women. I even offered to buy her ticket to Canada before she explained it was all of course just a joke. Before the election, I used my Dangerous Faggot college tour stop at Ohio University to point out something Dunham was serious about  \u2014   the extinction of white men. Maybe the real reason she\u2019s lost her appetite is that she realized her antics directly contributed to Daddy\u2019s election! A reasonable person at this point would say, \u201cWhy should we pay any attention to Lena Dunham at all?\u201d And it is a fair question. Her HBO series Girls is long gone, and her lack of comedic chops and acting skill ensures she won\u2019t have a serious career outside of small parts given to her out of pity and ideological sisterhood by   producers and directors. As President Donald Trump correctly put it,\u201dWell, she\u2019s a  . You know, she has no  \u2014   you know, no mojo. \u201d One could argue she has no mojo because that would be cultural appropriation from indigenous tribes, but either way, she certainly lacks the elusive star factor needed in Hollywood. But I\u2019d argue Lena Dunham is an important person to keep an eye on, even now, because she represents the continued lunacy of the left and the progressive march off the cliff. They\u2019ve doubled down on stupidity, and little lost Lena is a perfect case study of the terrible  . (I say \u201ckeep an eye on,\u201d but I mean this metaphorically. Even a few Lena Dunham photos can cause irreparable mental scarring and random malfunctions in the optic nerve.) Dunham has also revealed herself to be something of a chameleon, which is another reason we ought not count her out just yet. Consider the drastic changes she has undergone since the election. In the past she was content to be a typical feminist    and an ugly poster child for the body positivity movement. But since the election she has vomited forth a steady stream of hysteria and worse. Her immediate reaction to the election was to blame her fellow white women for the loss, inventing a new privilege called violent privilege to do so. It is certainly instructive that the sisterhood falls apart at the first sign of trouble. Dunham then posted a selfie while sitting on a toilet in December. It was a torrid cry for help from a frightened little girl  \u2014   not a brave move from an empowered woman. She had no clue why people didn\u2019t applaud her for it, either. Just a few weeks into the Trump presidency and the porcine princess of progressive politics is on hunger strike. What\u2019s not to love? And what could be coming next? It\u2019s all just so exciting. Because the deterioration of Lena\u2019s piddling reserves of sanity is speeding up. Will she next be spotted \u201cpunching a Nazi\u201d (i. e. anyone to the right of Jane Fonda)?  Will she run for the Senate against Al Franken, because he isn\u2019t unfunny enough to be the left\u2019s former star in Washington? Who can say! I guess there\u2019s a chance she will calm down and moderate her politics instead of attempting to further divide America. But realistically, there is a higher chance of me doing a photoshoot naked in a public bathroom eating cake. Not that such a shoot wouldn\u2019t be, like, super hot.
