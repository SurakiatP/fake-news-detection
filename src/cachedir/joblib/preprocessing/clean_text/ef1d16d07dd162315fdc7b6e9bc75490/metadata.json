{"duration": 0.1429908275604248, "input_args": {"text": "'In May 2015, Norm Macdonald appeared on the    episode of \u201cLate Show With David Letterman. \u201d He did about six minutes of   comedy, and then choked up when recalling the first time he saw Mr. Letterman perform. Finally, unsuccessfully fighting back tears, he turned toward the host\u2019s desk and told him, \u201cI love you. \u201d It was a jarring moment from the   Mr. Macdonald, and it represented a few more seconds of sincerity than you get in the 240 pages of \u201cBased on a True Story,\u201d his often very funny but always very fabulist \u201cmemoir. \u201d The book is most direct, and most convincingly   about the job of comedy. \u201c  comedy is a shabby business, made up of shabby fellows like me who cross the country, stay at shabby hotels, and tell jokes they no longer find funny,\u201d he writes in the introduction. Later he describes the dependable range of reaction from audiences: \u201cThey either hate you or they don\u2019t completely hate you. \u201d Mr. Macdonald has always been a comic\u2019s comic, best loved for his     which has shades of Steven Wright\u2019s concise wordplay and Andy Kaufman\u2019s   extended pranks. Those who aren\u2019t comedy nerds know him best from his stint as the host of \u201cWeekend Update\u201d on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d from 1994 to 1997. In \u201cBased on a True Story,\u201d Mr. Macdonald lists the \u201cTop 25 Weekend Update Jokes of All Time (in no particular order),\u201d starting with one from Chevy Chase\u2019s tenure as host and then 24 from his own. There\u2019s only one joke included about the O. J. Simpson trial. Mr. Macdonald feasted on the Simpson case during his time as anchor. (A compilation of the brief setups and punch lines on YouTube runs to more than 26 minutes.) When Mr. Macdonald was dismissed from that segment, the move was widely thought to have been orchestrated by the NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer, a friend of Mr. Simpson\u2019s. (Mr. Ohlmeyer denied that his friendship with Mr. Simpson was behind the decision.) So it\u2019s belated inside baseball for Mr. Macdonald to take on Mr. Ohlmeyer in this memoir. But it\u2019s scathing and funny, too. In the comedian\u2019s wicked reimagining, Mr. Ohlmeyer was upset when the O. J. jokes stopped, leaving him without material for teasing his buddy. \u201cI\u2019d give him the business about this whole   thing,\u201d Mr. Macdonald has his fictional version of Mr. Ohlmeyer say. \u201cLay a couple of zingers on him from your Update segment. Boy, old O. J. would see red, I\u2019m here to tell you. And the more steamed he got, the funnier it struck me. \u201d A memoir in the sense that it\u2019s roughly organized by the timeline of Mr. Macdonald\u2019s life and career, this book is absurd fiction in many of its details, even the most basic ones. \u201cI was a hick, born to the barren, rocky soil of the Ottawa Valley, where the richest man in town was the barber,\u201d Mr. Macdonald writes. He actually was born and raised in Quebec City. Likewise, he may have had an intense crush on Sarah Silverman during their time on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d together, but he most probably didn\u2019t have Colin Quinn help him arrange a hit on the life of Dave Attell, a fellow comedian and rival suitor. The book is also structured around a fictional (or partly real, who\u2019s to say) road trip to Las Vegas undertaken by Mr. Macdonald and a friend. Mr. Macdonald has spoken about his   gambling problems, though the book mostly presents them as just more outlandish material. (His best bit on the subject: \u201cI remember a psychiatrist once telling me that I gamble in order to escape the reality of life, and I told him that\u2019s why everyone does everything. \u201d) Mr. Macdonald\u2019s   work has a philosophy behind it, which is expressed in the book this way: \u201cA joke should catch people by surprise it should never pander. Applause is voluntary, but laughter is involuntary. \u201d Some of what\u2019s here won\u2019t be a surprise to fans. The book recycles pieces of Mr. Macdonald\u2019s   like his claim that he was in \u201cgreat shape\u201d as an infant. At 1 year old, he writes: \u201cI even looked good for my age. Strangers would always approach me, smiling, and they\u2019d say, \u2018Look at you, little boy, what are you, zero? \u2019\u201d We\u2019re also treated to the \u201cmoth joke,\u201d a   Dostoyevskian setup for a   gag. (It reads more smoothly than the version once shakily delivered on air to Conan O\u2019Brien.) The book doesn\u2019t stray far from   and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and why would it? Mr. Macdonald\u2019s one big starring film vehicle, \u201cDirty Work\u201d (1998) was called \u201cleaden,   attempted comedy\u201d in The New York Times. Other roles have included an uncredited bartender in \u201cDeuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo. \u201d Fans will know going in but others should be forewarned that Mr. Macdonald\u2019s punch lines, cartoonish as they are, are often built on grim foundations: prison rape drug deals gone very bad a young boy whose dying wish is to kill a baby seal. It\u2019s easy to believe that Mr. Macdonald is unusually funny while also understanding the limits of his career outside of clubs. He\u2019s an oddball by nature who also seems to have genuinely cultivated a disregard for conventional success. This memoir\u2019s evasive clowning is in keeping with all that. Some might hate it, but most won\u2019t completely hate it.'"}, "time": 1742561759.4773283}
