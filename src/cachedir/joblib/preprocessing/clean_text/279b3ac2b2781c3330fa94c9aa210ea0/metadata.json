N. ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow for a look at President Trump\u2019s first hundred days from a foreign policy and national security perspective. [Bolton said Trump\u2019s record has been \u201cmixed, depending on what area of the world, what particular crisis you look at, and really what point during the hundred days that you take. \u201d  \u201cI think in many respects the campaign rhetoric  \u2014   which was very, very tough on things like the Iran nuclear deal and the North Korean nuclear threat, much of which continued into the first hundred days  \u2014   is very much at risk of being subverted by the bureaucracy that the administration has not yet tamed,\u201d he cautioned.  \u201cThere\u2019s a significant risk that both because of some of the appointees that the president has named, and the appointees he hasn\u2019t named  \u2014   the people in the lower ranks who are the president\u2019s eyes and ears and implementers out in the bureaucracy, particularly at the State Department, which is expert at capturing political appointees, especially from Republican administrations. If the president\u2019s not careful, he will see his foreign policy  \u2014   despite what I think his own views are  \u2014   captured by the same bureaucracy that for eight years implemented the Obama foreign policy,\u201d he elaborated.  \u201cThat\u2019s the danger that I see. I don\u2019t think the president has moved on some of these key national security issues as far as the press would like you to believe, or as far as the bureaucracy would like you to believe. It remains to be seen how many people in the administration can remember what they said during the campaign on some of these issues,  particularly terrorism and nuclear proliferation, as the bureaucracy nibbles away at them,\u201d said Bolton. \u201cI think the president needs to be more of a disciplinarian with his subordinates and their bureaucracy,\u201d he advised.  \u201cI think that may be contrary to his natural instincts. I think he is an open, optimistic kind of man, and I think in the Trump Organization it was small enough that that kind of approach worked. But in the sprawling federal government, where different departments and agencies have their own cultures and their own agendas, especially in national security where they\u2019re not friendly to Republican administrations, he needs to be tougher out there. I\u2019m worried about what we\u2019re going to do on Iran. I\u2019m worried about what we\u2019re going to do on North Korea,\u201d Bolton said. He warned there is \u201ca whole range of issues where there is a real risk of creeping back to the Obama administration policy  \u2014   as the poem goes, \u2018not with a bang but with a whimper. \u2019\u201d \u201cNow, in other areas, I think he\u2019s pretty much holding the line, which is why I say overall I think the performance in the first hundred days is mixed,\u201d Bolton concluded. Focusing on the Iran nuclear deal, Bolton recalled the State Department\u2019s letter to Congress last week which \u201ccertified that Iran was in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal. \u201d \u201cThat is simply not true, in terms of their refusal to let the International Atomic Energy Agency visit key military sites, their excessive production of heavy water, their excessive enrichment of uranium, their gross disregard of the Security Council resolution and the part of the agreement dealing with ballistic missiles,\u201d he asserted. \u201cAnd those are just some of the things we know publicly. These are plain violations of the agreement. And that doesn\u2019t count the provisions of the agreement that are so ambiguous, so poorly drafted, so open to interpretations favorable to Iran that lawyers could end up debating them for decades into the future. \u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s even worse is, if you read the congressional statute carefully, the reporting obligation does not require the president to make a binary decision  \u2014   yes Iran is in compliance, or no Iran is not in compliance. By the statute\u2019s own terms, it allows the president to say, \u2018I am not able to certify that Iran is in compliance,\u2019 which he would have been perfectly legitimate within his rights to do, especially given the newness of the administration,\u201d he noted. \u201cNow, where did that certification come from? It came from the State Department bureaucracy. It came from the same people who negotiated the deal that was finally agreed to in the summer of 2015, and who have been protecting it, nurturing it, sheltering it for a year and a half since then. This may sound like a small point, but I\u2019ll tell you, the proponents of the deal have taken that certification in just one week and said, \u2018See, even the Trump administration says that the good old ayatollahs in Iran are complying with the deal,\u2019\u201d Bolton said.  \u201cThe negative implication of that, as the Trump administration then goes on to say Iran\u2019s behavior in most material respects, as the president himself said, violates the spirit of the deal. Well, it goes beyond that. It violates the letter of the deal as well,\u201d he contended.  \u201cI\u2019ve heard different stories, frankly, about whether the White House cleared that document or not, or whether  \u2014   as is often the case with the bureaucracy  \u2014   they come running in and say, \u2018This is due on Capitol Hill at 5 P. M.! We\u2019ve got to send it! We\u2019ve got to send it, or we\u2019ll be in default, we\u2019ll be delinquent, we\u2019ll be subject to criticism!\u2019 So people say well, all right, I guess we\u2019ve got to send it, and they don\u2019t have time to think through the implications,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is to me a kind of textbook example, in the case of Iran, how a very strong and   foreign policy just gets whittled away. It may seem like water eroding rock. It doesn\u2019t happen in dramatic moments. But I\u2019m just telling you, this is the way bureaucracy works, and it works to undercut especially conservative and Republican presidents,\u201d Bolton lamented. Breitbart News National Security Editor Frances Martel joined the conversation to ask Bolton about the deep relationship between the nuclear issues in Iran and North Korea, which are generally treated as entirely separate matters in media coverage. \u201cThe media don\u2019t get the connection, and that in part is because the national security bureaucracy doesn\u2019t get, or doesn\u2019t want to talk about, the connection,\u201d Bolton replied, portraying it as \u201ca classic bureaucratic example of what they call silos. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got the people dealing with Iran there in one silo, you\u2019ve got the people dealing with North Korea in another silo. They might as well be on different planets,\u201d he explained.  \u201cBut the fact is, again, from publicly available information going back 30 years, we know that the North Koreans and the Iranians have been in close cooperation on the development of ballistic missiles for that entire period. North Korea sold Iran the first SCUD missiles that were the basis for the Iranian missile program. They\u2019ve cooperated in multiple ways since then. It makes perfectly good sense for that to happen. They\u2019re both using the same   SCUD missile technology for their missile programs, so they\u2019ve got a common scientific and engineering base. Their objectives for the missile programs are exactly the same. It\u2019s to deliver nuclear weapons, not launch communications or weather satellites. On that score, it\u2019s just absolutely clear,\u201d Bolton said.  \u201cIt is less clear in terms of publicly available evidence on the nuclear side, but I think there is substantial reason to believe there\u2019s close cooperation there as well,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe reactor that Israel destroyed in Syria in September of 2007 was being built by North Koreans. It was a clone of the North Korean Yongbyon reactor. Most people don\u2019t think Syria had the financial wherewithal to pay for building that kind of reactor, and the North Koreans don\u2019t do anything for free, so where did the money come from? I think it probably came from Iran. \u201d  \u201cI think there are a lot of other connections that have been noted, the Iranian scientists in North Korea and vice versa. Forget the Iran nuclear deal for a minute  \u2014   it\u2019s entirely foreseeable that the day North Korea gets the capability to drop a nuclear warhead on the United States via ballistic missile, Iran could have that capability the next day by writing a check in the right amount of money, so this relationship is extremely important,\u201d he warned.  \u201cOn North Korea itself, the administration started off again with a very tough line on this  \u2014   and yet yesterday, in an interview with Fox News, Secretary Tillerson said he\u2019d be willing to have bilateral discussions with North Korea. This is after saying that the Obama \u2018strategic patience\u2019 doctrine was being rejected, after saying correctly we\u2019ve negotiated with North Korea for 25 years and it hasn\u2019t produced anything. Now we\u2019re back to negotiating with North Korea and pressuring China to pressure North Korea. This is like Year 26 of the same failed policy,\u201d Bolton complained.  \u201cNow, I don\u2019t want to overstate that, the secretary might have misstated what he implied by that, and certainly China has done a few things in the past couple of weeks that look encouraging. But I\u2019ve been around that track before. When the heat gets too great, the Chinese pat the North Koreans on the fanny and say, \u2018bad boys!\u2019 They take some steps that appear to put pressure on North Korea, and then they hope that Americans with our famously short attention spans turn away, and the heat goes off, and then they quietly go back to business as before the particular crisis,\u201d he said. Bolton urged policymakers to remember that North Korea sees nuclear weapons as a tool for implementing a dangerous   policy agenda, which they would not abandon even if their nuclear aspirations were decisively thwarted. \u201cI think the same is true for the ayatollahs in Iran,\u201d he added. \u201cSo when you say to Kim   and his generals, \u2018Give up your nuclear weapons,\u2019 what they hear is \u2018give up up your regime, and maybe give up your lives, while we\u2019re on the subject.\u2019 They\u2019re not going to do it. \u201d  \u201cWe have tried diplomacy, persuasion. We have tried sanctions, coercion, in differing measures, different combinations, for 26 years. It just hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d he said.  \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the only   solution is reunifying the two Koreas,\u201d Bolton offered. \u201cI think we could explain to China why that\u2019s in their best interest. The Chinese say they don\u2019t want North Korea to have a nuclear weapon because it would be destabilizing in East Asia. That\u2019s code for saying they\u2019re afraid Japan is going to get nuclear weapons. But they have not taken the steps necessary in the past to pressure North Korea to give up the weapons because they understand just how frail that regime really is, and they\u2019re worried it will collapse in an uncontrolled fashion that will cause them all kinds of problems. \u201d  \u201cI think there\u2019s a deal here. I think it\u2019s complicated and difficult to negotiate. I wish we had started 15 years ago. But we\u2019re in a race now, because the factor that\u2019s changed from the last 25 years to today is, North Korea this time is really very close to having the capability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon, put it under the nose cone of an ICBM, and launch the ICBM towards the United States. That\u2019s what\u2019s really driving people,\u201d Bolton observed.  \u201cObama just watched it all happen for eight years. He\u2019s dumped this problem on the Trump administration. But it\u2019s also why we need a policy change. If you try in Year 26 to keep doing what you\u2019ve done and failed to accomplish your objective, for the last 25 years  \u2014   who has any reason to believe that in Year 26 you\u2019re going to get a different result?\u201d he asked. Marlow asked what South Koreans thought of his unification idea. \u201cMany of them are not wild about it, because they look at the example of German reunification, they saw it was very costly to the West Germans,\u201d Bolton conceded. \u201cI think there are real differences between the two circumstances. I think in fact for South Korea this is a huge economic opportunity, to be perfectly crass about it. You\u2019ve got a wage base in North Korea of roughly zero, so that by putting manufacturing and other facilities up there, eventually the wages in North Korea will be the same as the wages in South Korea, but not in the immediate future. \u201d  \u201cIt is something that\u2019s going to come anyway,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThe division of the Korean peninsula is unnatural, just as the division of Germany was. It was always intended to be temporary until the Cold War intervened. There will be reunification one day. The issue remains, will it be accomplished in a restrained and careful fashion that works out in our interests, and maybe in the interests of China as well, or will it occur catastrophically?\u201d  \u201cIf the United States at some point has to strike preemptively against North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities, there\u2019s every prospect that that could ignite a broader conflict on the peninsula that would be devastating all around, and would almost certainly produce the collapse of the North Korean regime. I would say to China, \u2018Look, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way. Which would you rather do? \u2019\u201d he advised.  \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the larger objective of reunification has to be really the policy objective because we tried to stop the nuclear program in North Korea for 25 years and we have failed. We have failed because persuasion has failed. We have failed because coercion has failed. We have failed because the combination of coercion and persuasion has failed. So now we\u2019re going to try it again? I just hope that\u2019s not where the State Department is going,\u201d said Bolton. Marlow suggested it might be difficult to reconcile the intense amount of diplomacy and economic involvement required to achieve Korean unification with President Trump\u2019s campaign promise of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy. \u201cThe detonation of a nuclear weapon on a major American city can really concentrate your attention,\u201d Bolton replied. \u201cThis is putting America first. We are a global power. That\u2019s a reality. Therefore, our interests are worldwide. South Korea and Japan are two of our biggest trading partners, and they are threatened by this erratic, irrational regime in North Korea. We are on the verge of being threatened in the United States ourselves. We\u2019ve got inadequate defense capabilities. \u201d  \u201cBarack Obama gutted the national missile defense program that George Bush had started. We\u2019d be in much better shape if we could defend ourselves against North Korean or Iranian missile launches, but we have a wholly inadequate capability at the moment. So there are a lot of challenges that the president has to face, even though  \u2014   like most presidents, I suppose  \u2014   he\u2019d rather focus on domestic issues,\u201d Bolton observed.
