Anthony Weiner is just the surface reason.\\nFBI Director James Comey saw the mutiny within the FBI with many FBI agents revolting over his decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton back in July 2016.\\nSo here\u2019s the bombshell: Comey decided to reopen Hillary\u2019s email investigation because he is fearing that he will get arrested and put behind bars for corruption and collusion in case Donald Trump wins.\\nHe reopened the case, to create an escape route in case Trump wins. Its quite simple actually. James Comey did not provide any recent proof he stumbled upon and neither will he until the election is over. Yes he\u2019s technically not allowed to but he could just indict Hillary in a second if he truly wanted just for lying to the FBI or wiping the server to get rid of all the evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena.\\nSo if Hillary Clinton wins, Comey will simply close the case and declare that nothing was substantial after all and she dust made a mistake, just like he did before.\\nIf Donald Trump wins, he will finalize the investigation and put Hillary Clinton behind bars, then he will tell Donald Trump: \u201cSee? I was fair and I wasn\u2019t corrupt! I DID arrest her after all and I did my job!\u201d hoping to get away with what he did during the first investigation.\\nMake no mistake about it, this isn\u2019t coincidence, Comey surely fears Trump\u2019s retribution, the decision to reopen the investigation came just 1 single day after Trump called the FBI corrupt and called for a reopening of the investigation, see for yourself .\\nTrump is pretty tolerant guy so this may actually work out for Comey. He wrongfully forgave many people! For example, after having an conflict with Paul Ryan refusing to endorse Trump back in the primaries, Trump finally decided to forgive Ryan and ENDORSE him right before the Wisconsin congress elections. If Trump wasn\u2019t soft regarding some of those traitors, he would have endorsed Paul Nehlen instead but he didn\u2019t and it was a mistake as we now know.\\nComey however will have to look authentic though and he will have to prove to Trump BEFORE the elections that he is truly on to something and that this isn\u2019t just a political move. Don\u2019t expect for Comey to go to hard because he\u2019s well aware that if he goes too hard on Queen of the Underworld Hillary and she wins, then he will rot in jail for the rest of his life because Hillary is the revengeful type.\\nJust to prove the case that she is revengeful, look at what she did after Trump slammed Bill Clinton as a rapist during the 2nd debate. Before the 3rd debate even started, she paid a couple of skanks to go out and publically lie, falsely accuse Trump of raping and groping them. During the 2nd debate she was looking at Trump with hatred while he was speaking and she was looking like she was thinking to herself things similar to this: \u201cOhh yeah? F**k you! Wait till you see what I\u2019ll do to you next time! You\u2019re gonna regret this!\u201d And YES she was even seen on live TV telling Trump \u201cF**k you!\u201d during the 2nd debate . Hillary was infuriated because Trump brought Bill\u2019s rape victims up during that debate, but most people didn\u2019t catch it! She was clearly infuriated and already plotting revenge in her mind.\\nSo with that said, don\u2019t expect Hillary Clinton to get indicted BEFORE the election. It\u2019s not gonna happen. Comey is a weasel appointed by Obama. Basically he\u2019s a Democrat. The funny thing is that even though he\u2019s a Democrat in disguise, fellow Democrats are already calling Comey \u201ctraitor\u201d, \u201cRussian agent\u201d and \u201cPutin puppet\u201d on Twitter . Everyone who disagrees with them must be a Russian agent these days. They really love their conspiracy theories. After all isn\u2019t John Podesta interested in aliens, UFOs and Area 51? You can\u2019t make this stuff up. Really funny stuff to watch those crazy liberals going full psycho.\\nBut even if Comey is playing on the safe side with both candidates, Hillary would definitely sink her fangs into his neck for reopening the case, should she win. Even if he does NOTHING and just closes the case after a Hillary victory, she would still take her revenge. It\u2019s in her character, she\u2019s revengeful and besides its a classic mafia tactic, leave no traitor alive or among your ranks. She would at the very least replace him.\\nAdditionally Comey wanted to calm down an FBI which was facing a full pitchfork revolution from within with many agents being angered by this. Jill McCabe, the wife of the FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe who investigated Hillary Clinton, received a $675.000 \u201cdonation\u201d (bribe) from Hillary Clinton. The agents were angry. So this move to reopen the case was also strategic with his agents. It will calm the waters down for a while. If Hillary wins he will just tell the agents to go F themselves and look for a another job if they don\u2019t like it, if Trump wins and Comey indicts Hillary after the election, the other agents will be pleased.\\nHillary probably has something on Comey on which she could blackmail him with but it won\u2019t matter because IF he will do his job and arrest Hillary shortly after the election, Trump will be pleased and keep him on as the director.\\nJames Comey would prefer Hillary to win though because that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t indict her during the first investigation, but he\u2019s gotta defend his ass by preparing for a different scenario, like a Trump victory so that\u2019s exactly why he reopened the investigation now.\\nTrump will win in a landslide and Comey will most likely be fine should he prove himself worthy before the election and actually do something.\\nExpect more of those two-faced people to come out and do the same in the next days. Expect event he likes of CNN, New York Times to stop bashing Trump as everyone will have to prepare for the possibility of a Trump victory, out of fear of a huge retribution in case they don\u2019t change. Remember those libel laws CNN?\\n'"}, "time": 1742564127.0710251}
