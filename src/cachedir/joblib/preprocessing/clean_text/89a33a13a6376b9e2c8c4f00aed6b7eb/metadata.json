The Shia fighters have announced that they would mostly help the drive around Mosul and not enter the city to avoid accusations of sectarianism. \\nThe volunteer forces on Saturday began an offensive west of Mosul to cut supplies between the city and Raqqah, the de facto capital of Daesh in Syria, to tighten the siege against the militants and liberate the town of Tal Afar. \\nThe forces have played a major role in previous offensives against Daesh in central and western parts of Iraq. The group\u2019s members have already fought alongside Syrian forces against various terror groups, but the Saturday announcement could formalize their involvement in Syria. \\nOver the past months, Syria has managed to recapture swathes of land from Daesh and other groups in east and north of the country. During the nearly six-year battle, the Syrian military has heavily relied on fighters from Lebanese resistance movement, Hezbollah, as well as advisory military support from Iran. Russia also helps Syria in the fight against terrorists through a series of coordinated airstrikes on their positions.'"}, "time": 1742562339.98487}
