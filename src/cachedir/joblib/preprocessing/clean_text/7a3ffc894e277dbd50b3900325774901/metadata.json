He was found guilty and sentenced over the March 23, 2015, kidnapping of Denise Huskins.  According to the Los Angeles Times, Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn were asleep in a home on Mare Island when they awoke to see Muller standing by them. He held them at bay with a water gun \u2014  which was painted to look real \u2014  then drugged, bound, and blindfolded them. He put Huskins in the trunk of Quinn\u2019s car, then moved her to the trunk of a second vehicle and drove her to his parents\u2019 South Lake Tahoe home. Once there, Huskins said she was \u201csecured on a bed with a zip tie and a bike lock and blindfolded with a pair of   swim goggles\u201d and sexually assaulted. On March 25, 2015, Muller drove Huskins to Huntington Beach and released her. Vallejo police were suspicious because Huskins \u201creappeared carrying an overnight bag and wearing sunglasses. \u201d Vallejo police Capt. James O\u2019Connell said Huskins \u201cdid not act like a kidnapping victim. \u201d Less the 24 hours after Huskins was released the VPD equated the kidnapping investigation to a \u201cwild goose chase. \u201d Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park said, \u201cToday, there is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger abduction or an abduction at all. Given the facts that have been presented thus far, this event appears to be an orchestrated event and not a crime. \u201d CBS San Francisco reports that the police actually \u201caccused\u201d Huskins and Quinn of \u201cmaking up the crime. \u201d The FBI arrested Muller on June 8, 2015, after identifying him from a failed kidnapping attempt that had occurred prior to Huskins\u2019 abduction. The Vallejo PD sent a letter to Huskins and Quinn a month after Muller\u2019s arrest, saying, \u201cIt is now clear that there was a kidnapping on March 23, 2015, that it was not a hoax or orchestrated event and that VPD conclusions were incorrect. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
