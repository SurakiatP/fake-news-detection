Described as uncouth, barbaric, lacking both morals and ethics, addicted to vice, and definitely not the most popular king, he was killed by an arrow to the lungs-probably shot by one of his own men. \\nAlthough his body was left where it lay when he was shot in the New Forest, it was said it was later removed to Winchester Cathedral. From there, the bones were scattered around during the English Civil War and later put in a giant mortuary chest along with Kings Egbert, Ethelwulfe, and others. \\nBut the body of King William II Rufus was actually identified at the Motor City Museum, which is near the New Forest area where King Rufus was shot. Apparently, the king was so popular that they just dug a shallow grave in the New Forest area and tossed him in. \\nThe grave was discovered when the museum was breaking ground in its parking lot for a new area to display its 1895 Knight auto. The workers came upon some bones (apparently the citizens who buried King Rufus didn\\'t bother with a coffin) and sent them to the British Museum for identification. \\nSince the royal Norman DNA was on file, it was determined to be Rufus from process of elimination. And someone had carved \"Rufus\" on the femur. Make Al N.\\'s day - give this story five thumbs-up (there\\'s no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)'"}, "time": 1742563101.6756308}
