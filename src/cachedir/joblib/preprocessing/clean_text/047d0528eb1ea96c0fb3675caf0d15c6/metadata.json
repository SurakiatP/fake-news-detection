Maybe it\u2019s the story you decide against doing because it\u2019s liable to provoke a   president to put the power of his office behind his attempt to destroy your reputation by falsely calling your journalism \u201cfake. \u201d Maybe it\u2019s the line you hold back from your script or your article because it could trigger a federal leak investigation into you and your sources (so, yeah, jail). Or, maybe it\u2019s the commentary you spike because you\u2019re a publicly supported news channel and you worry it will cost your station its federal financing. In that last case, your fear would be existential  \u2014   a matter of your very survival  \u2014   and your motivation to   could prove overwhelming. We no longer have to imagine it. We got a   example last week in San Antonio, where a PBS station sat atop the slippery slope toward censorship and then promptly started down it. It\u2019s a single television station in a single state in a very big country. And the right thing ultimately happened. But only after a very wrong thing happened. The editorial misfire bears retelling because it showed the most likely way that the new administration\u2019s attempts to shut down the free press could succeed, just as it shows how those attempts can be stopped. The story began with a Jan. 24 speech that Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, gave on the House floor regarding what he described as the unfair way the national media was covering President Trump. He said for instance that the media ignored highs in consumer confidence, which of course it did not. And he ended with an admonition for his constituents: \u201cBetter to get your news directly from the president. In fact, it might be the only way to get the unvarnished truth. \u201d His remarks caught the notice, and the ire, of a longtime San   journalist and commentator, Rick Casey, who hosts a weekly public affairs program \u201cTexas Week\u201d on KLRN. He ends each week\u2019s show with his own commentary, which also runs in The San Antonio  . Mr. Casey has been able to work for \u201c40 years as a professional smart ass,\u201d he told me, because \u201cI\u2019m not really a bomb thrower  \u2014   I\u2019ve watched politicians for so many years that I know how to be strong about something without being unfriendly. \u201d But Mr. Smith\u2019s comments bothered him enough that he wrote up a stemwinder of a closing commentary. \u201cSmith\u2019s proposal is quite innovative for America,\u201d it went. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really tried getting all our news from our top elected official. It has been tried elsewhere, however. North Korea comes to mind. \u201d All set to go, the commentary was mentioned in a Facebook promotion for the show, which in turn caught the eye of Mr. Smith\u2019s office, which called the station to inquire about the segment. Forty minutes before the show aired, the station\u2019s president and chief executive, Arthur Rojas Emerson, left a message for Mr. Casey saying he was pulling the commentary and replacing it with an older one. Mr. Casey told me he missed the call, but saw what happened with his own eyes. At a meeting the next Monday, Mr. Casey said, Mr. Emerson expressed concern \u201cthat the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was under attack and that this would add to it. \u201d The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides financing for public stations, including KLRN, and Mr. Trump\u2019s election has heightened fears that its financing will be cut. It also happens that Mr. Emerson had left journalism for several years to run his own advertising firm and that Mr. Smith had at one point been a client. Mr. Casey says he asked Mr. Emerson if he\u2019d be willing to come on the program and discuss it all, but Mr. Emerson declined. And that seemed to be that. But as we\u2019re learning this year, journalism has a safety net in the people who appreciate it, and the people who work in it. First, when Mr. Casey\u2019s commentary ran as planned in The San Antonio   astute readers noticed it was different than the previous night\u2019s televised commentary. The story of what happened began traveling around San Antonio journalism circles, making its way to the   columnist Gilbert Garcia, who shared the details last Friday.  Another titan of Texas journalism, Evan Smith, who   The Texas Tribune and regularly appears on Mr. Casey\u2019s program, noticed Mr. Garcia\u2019s column while he was in Washington. \u201cI had a hot coffee in my hand and I came very close to dropping it,\u201d Mr. Smith told me. \u201cHolding people accountable in public life is so fundamentally important that this idea that somehow we\u2019re going to stop doing that because we\u2019re worried about what the government\u2019s going to do to us, I so unbelievably reject that. \u201d As it happened, Evan Smith was in Washington for a meeting of the PBS national board, on which he sits, and \u201cI certainly got into the board room and talked to people in the system. \u201d He also called Mr. Emerson, and told him \u201cI didn\u2019t see why The Tribune or I should continue to be associated with this show or this station. \u201d By late last week, Mr. Emerson had agreed to let Mr. Casey\u2019s original segment run this Friday, as long as it included a new \u201ccommentary\u201d label that will run with his opinion segments. When I caught up with Mr. Emerson this week he acknowledged making \u201ca mistake\u201d that should not tarnish a career spent mostly in broadcast news, starting in a $1.   job as a cameraman. \u201cI had to make a decision in what was about 20 minutes,\u201d he said. He acknowledged that \u201cclearly we always worry about funding for public television,\u201d but said that wasn\u2019t the \u201cprincipal reason\u201d for his decision to hold back the commentary. \u201cWe have to protect the neutrality of the station  \u2014   somebody could have looked at it as slander,\u201d he said. The \u201ccommentary\u201d label, he said, would take care of it. Mr. Casey is satisfied with the result. But he acknowledged that it was a close call and that he was uniquely qualified to push back in a way others might not be. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be in the position of being 70 years old, and not in the position of being 45,\u201d he said, meaning that job security was not the same issue. \u201cThere\u2019s no level of heroism here. \u201d In a week in which Congress is calling for a leak investigation into stories in The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN that led to Michael T. Flynn\u2019s forced resignation as national security adviser, heroism is what\u2019s called for. Hopefully there\u2019s enough of it to go around.'"}, "time": 1742562197.8996532}
