Boehner said, \u201cLet me address this because some people have gotten carried away in their interpretation of what I said. Listen, Donald Trump is my friend. He was my supporter. I play golf with him and frankly, I like the president. I voted for him. I want him and frankly, I want the country to succeed. But I\u2019ve seen some people write  \u2014   I think they\u2019ve gotten a little carried away in their interpretation of what I said. \u201d \u201cI did not say that the president\u2019s policies were a disaster,\u201d he continued. \u201cI did not say that the president\u2019s agenda was a disaster. What I was referring to was the execution of the president\u2019s agenda and the president\u2019s policies.
