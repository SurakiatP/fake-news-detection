But draining the swamp involves removing the inhabitants of that swamp. Globalist Mitt Romney, keeper of the Bush Crime Family legacy, is one of the big frogs in that elitist swamp. So it stands to reason that Donald Trump could \u2013 under NO circumstances \u2013 choose Romney for any position in his cabinet. What do you think? Please comment below. \\n\u201cReceiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney,\u201d Conway said, linking to a story about Trump loyalists who are unhappy with the possibility. Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state https://t.co/HDtpjeJTc3 \\n\u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016 \\nShe also stressed loyalty as a key trait for a secretary of State in a follow-up tweet. Conway told CNN that her tweets reflect the private discussions she\u2019s had with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence . Kissinger & Schultz as Secs of State flew around the world less, counseled POTUS close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist. \\n\u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016 \\n\u201cI am struck by the intensity and volume of resistance [to Romney] from the grassroots; words like \u2018betrayal,\u2019\u201d Conway said. \u201cI communicate with PEOTUS and VPEOTUS privately and regularly so this is not an attempt to do so publicly as some (who missed the election completely) are suggesting.\u201d \\nShe said she respects \u201ccompletely\u201d that these \u201cweighty decisions\u201d rest with Trump, \u201ca man whose political instincts and unconventional campaign defied the critics and made history.\u201d \\nSome Trump supporters and allies have tried to steer the President-elect from nominating Romney as the U.S.\u2019s chief diplomat. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, was highly critical of Trump during the campaign and called him a \u201cphony,\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d and dedicated an entire speech in March to denouncing his candidacy. \\n\u201cHe attacked [Trump] on a personal level about his character, his integrity, his honor,\u201d Trump supporter Mike Huckabee said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Wednesday. The former Arkansas governor added that it would be a \u201creal insult\u201d to Trump voters if Romney was nominated to be secretary of State. \\nOther Trump supporters, like former Speaker Newt Gingrich , have said they favor former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for the job. \\n\u201cI think that, if you want someone who is going to go out and be a very tough negotiator for America and represent American interest in the way that Trump campaigned, I think that probably Rudy is the better pick and has the right temperament.\u201d source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.
