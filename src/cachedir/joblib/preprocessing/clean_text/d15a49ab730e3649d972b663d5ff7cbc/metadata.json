Speaking to reporters aboard a plane taking him back to Rome from Armenia, the pope also said the church should ask forgiveness for the way it has treated women, for turning a blind eye to child labor and for \u201cblessing so many weapons\u201d in the past. In an hourlong freewheeling conversation that has become a trademark of his international travels, Francis was asked by a reporter if he agreed with recent comments by a Roman Catholic cardinal from Germany that the church should apologize to gays and if an apology was made more urgent by the killing of 49 people at a gay club in Florida this month. Francis, looking sad, recalled church teachings that homosexuals \u201cshould not be discriminated against. \u201d \u201cThey should be respected, accompanied pastorally,\u201d he said. Then he added that he thought the church should apologize not only to gay people it had offended, but also to the poor, to women who have been exploited, and to children who have been exploited by being forced to work. \u201cIt must apologize for having blessed so many weapons,\u201d Francis added. The church teaches that gay tendencies are not sinful but that gay acts are, and that gays should try to be chaste. The pope repeated a slightly modified version of the   \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d comment he made about gays on the first foreign trip after his election in 2013. \u201cThe questions is: If a person who has that condition, who has good will, and who looks for God, who are we to judge?\u201d he said. A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said that the pope\u2019s reference to \u201cthat condition\u201d referred not to a medical condition but to \u201ca person in that situation. \u201d In Italian, the word condition can also mean situation. \u201cWe Christians have to apologize for so many things, not just for this (treatment of gays) but we must ask for forgiveness, not just apologize. Forgiveness  \u2014   Lord, it is a word we forget so often,\u201d he said. Francis has been hailed by many gay people for being the most merciful pope toward them in recent history, and conservative Catholics have criticized him for making comments that they say are ambiguous about sexual morality. He told reporters on the plane that \u201cthere are traditions in some countries, some cultures, that have a different mentality about this question (gays)\u201d and that there were \u201csome (gay) demonstrations that are too offensive for some. \u201d But he suggested that those were not grounds for discrimination or marginalization of gays. The pope did not elaborate on what he meant by seeking forgiveness for the church \u201chaving blessed so many weapons,\u201d but it appeared to be a reference to some Catholics who have actively backed wars in the past. In other parts of the conversation, Francis said he hoped the European Union would be able to give itself another form after Britain\u2019s vote to leave. \u201cLet\u2019s not throw the baby out with the bath water,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s try to   things, to  . \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563559.0636208}
