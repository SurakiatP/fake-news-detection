[McCarty\u2019s bill \u2014  AB 424 \u2014  was introduced months ago and is snaking its way through the legislative process.  He introduced the bill on February 13 and in   Bakersfield. com reported that it was being pushed as a way \u201cof closing a loophole in the Gun Free School Zone Act. That act, also known as SB 707, barred firearms on school grounds, but made exceptions for anyone granted permission by local superintendents. \u201d AB 424 would take away superintendents\u2019 powers to allow teachers with CCW\u2019s to be armed for  . Gun Owners of California\u2019s Sam Peredes talked to Breitbart News on May 12 and said, \u201cTwo years ago, California passed a bill saying a concealed carry permit holder could not carry on any school campus unless they had the authorization of the school administrator. Well, out of the one thousand school districts in California, five of them decided to allow concealed permit holders to carry on their campuses. That so ticked off the legislature that now they are going to take away the authority of even administrators to allow CCW holders to carry on their campuses. \u201d Breitbart News previously reported that that five school districts which chose to allow CCW holders to carry on campus for   are Kern High School District, Kingsburg Joint Union High School District, Folsom Cordova Unified School District, Anderson Union High School District, and Palo Cedro\u2019s North Cow Creek School District, McCarty justified his push to disarm teachers, saying, \u201cA safe learning environment is essential for our children to be successful in the classroom. That\u2019s not possible if a school district allows armed civilians to roam California school campuses. \u201d Missing from McCarty\u2019s appraisal is the fact that Sandy Hook Elementary was a safe learning environment until a mass attacker ignored the   zone signage, and once he was in the building no one was armed to stop him. McCarty and other Democrats must realize that attackers who refuse to heed a \u201cgun free zone\u201d sign will have no one to stop them once the teachers and staff are disarmed in California either.
