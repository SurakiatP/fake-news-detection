S. revamps its flawed screening process as an \u201cimmigration ban,\u201d which McKibben claimed was actually a \u201ccalculated assault\u201d on Muslims, morality, and \u201con simple kindness. \u201d \u201cIt was a probe to find out if Americans would come to the defense of a minority that we\u2019d been told to fear and hate,\u201d he claimed.  \u201cAnd it failed  \u2014   not because a federal judge struck down the ban, but because Americans in their millions poured into airport baggage terminals and city squares. \u201d McKibben went on to charge that Trump and Bannon may be \u201ccounting on a   Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way. \u201d He wrote: The outpouring was not a show of Muslim strength  \u2014   there really isn\u2019t much Muslim strength in America. It was a demonstration that, for the moment, our moral commitment to the underdog still holds. But there are no guarantees: morality can bend pretty easily in the face of fear, and you know that Bannon and Trump are counting on a   Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way. And in any event, morality is the not the only pillar they\u2019re after. Next on the list is reason: the attack on climate science is, in fact, an attack on science itself, on the enterprise that undergirds modernity. McKibben\u2019s charge about a \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d referred to an error made by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who mistakenly said that \u201cPresident Obama had a   ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. \u201d In actuality, Obama\u2019s State Department in 2011 reportedly imposed a six month freeze on the processing of Iraqi refugees. The halt was the result of the discovery of two   members admitted as refugees from Iraq who were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky and admitted to targeting U. S. troops in Iraq. McKibben is founder of 350. org, which bills itself as a grassroots group building a \u201cglobal climate movement. \u201d  The group is funded by the George   Tides Foundation and a slew of   philanthropies. In a 2010 review of one of his books, Time magazine opined that McKibben \u201cmay be the world\u2019s best green journalist. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
