[The rally was in support of proposed legislation that would undo campus carry for   citizens, forcing said citizens to wander the campus defenseless like everybody else.  According to KMUW, \u201ca small group\u201d of students and staff rallied the Rhatigan Student Center. Their motto was \u201cCarry Minds, Not Guns. \u201d Freshman Ian Englebright said campus carry \u201ccreates more problems than solutions. \u201d He said lawmakers who supported guns for   \u201cthink that by having concealed carry on this campus they\u2019re making it safer, when in fact, I feel more uncomfortable because I don\u2019t know if the person next to me has a gun or not. \u201d The 15 person rally at Wichita State was designed to pressure lawmakers into adopting a revision of the state\u2019s campus carry law. That revision would allow colleges and universities to opt out of campus carry, creating a situation like we currently see in Ohio, where campus carry is legal at the state level but barred by every college and university because some students get nervous when   citizens are armed for  . For example, Ohio State University president Michael Drake is against campus carry. And even after 11 people were hospitalized following the November 28 car and knife attack attack on the Ohio State campus, Drake voiced his opposition for allowing   students to be armed to fight back. He said, \u201cWe had a circumstance here where there was someone who was a threat to the community and he was neutralized by a professional within one minute and that would be how we think things should go. \u201d The legislative change sought in Kansas would result in numerous colleges and universities taking a similar position, mandating that students remain defenseless in the classroom and simply dial 911 then shelter in place while law enforcement responds. This is the type of plan that was followed on April 16, 2007, when 32 unarmed people were shot to death on Virginia Tech\u2019s   campus.
