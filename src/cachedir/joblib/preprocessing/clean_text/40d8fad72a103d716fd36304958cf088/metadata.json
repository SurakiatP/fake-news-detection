The development is unusual the reporter, Fred Lucas, is the first member of his organization to take on pool reporting duties, which are typically handled on a rotating basis by mainstream news organizations. Lucas also covered Pence as the pooler two weeks ago. Lucas writes for the Daily Signal, a news and commentary site started nearly three years ago by Heritage, one of Washington\u2019s leading policy shops. The Signal covers issues that are a focus of Heritage\u2019s conservative agenda, such as an Obamacare repeal, tax policy and illegal immigration.
