[Bill 89, \u201cSupporting Children, Youth and Families Act, 2017,\u201d was approved on June 1 by a vote of 63 to 23.  The Minister of Children and Youth Services, Michael Coteau, who introduced the bill, said earlier this year that a parent\u2019s failure to recognize and support a child\u2019s gender   is a form of child abuse, and a child in these circumstances should be removed from the situation and placed into protection. \u201cI would consider that a form of abuse, when a child identifies one way and a caregiver is saying no, you need to do this differently,\u201d Coteau said. \u201cIf it\u2019s abuse, and if it\u2019s within the definition, a child can be removed from that environment and placed into protection where the abuse stops. \u201d The new bill replaces the Child and Family Services Act, or Bill 28, which governed child protection, foster care and adoption services. While \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cgender expression\u201d are included in the new legislation as important factors to be considered in determining \u201cthe best interests of the child,\u201d the religious faith in which the parents are raising the child \u2014  present in former laws \u2014  has been removed from consideration for assessing the child\u2019s best interests. Child protection agents, adoption service providers and judges are now required to take into account and respect a child\u2019s \u201crace, ancestry, place of origin, color, ethnic origin, citizenship, family diversity, disability, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. \u201d The former law stated that the parent of a child in care has the right \u201cto direct the child\u2019s education and religious upbringing. \u201d The new law has removed that consideration, saying parents can direct the child\u2019s education and upbringing \u201cin accordance with the child\u2019s or young person\u2019s creed, community identity and cultural identity. \u201d Some Christians have reacted strongly to the new bill, calling it a violation of parents\u2019 primordial rights to educate their children and a direct assault on Christian beliefs. \u201cWith the passage of Bill 89, we\u2019ve entered an era of totalitarian power by the state, such as never witnessed before in Canada\u2019s history,\u201d said Jack Fonseca, senior political strategist for Campaign Life Coalition. \u201cMake no mistake, Bill 89 is a grave threat to Christians and all people of faith who have children, or who hope to grow their family through adoption. \u201d Canadian child protection services are no stranger to invasive micromanagement of   according to a predetermined worldview. In April of this year, a Christian couple filed a lawsuit against Hamilton Children\u2019s Aid Society after two foster children were removed from their care because they refused tell the children that the Easter bunny is real. \u201cWe have a   policy,\u201d said Derek Baars, one of the foster parents, as the motivation for disobeying a child support worker who ordered him and his wife to tell the two girls in their care, aged 3 and 4, that the Easter bunny is real. \u201cWe explained to the agency that we are not prepared to tell the children a lie. If the children asked, we would not lie to them, but we wouldn\u2019t bring it up ourselves,\u201d Baars said. Follow Thomas D.
