Mr. Wilmore will develop scripted material for that   studio, and will work with network executives in helping to recruit talent, ABC said. Exact terms of the multiyear deal were not disclosed. Mr. Wilmore, who was the \u201csenior black correspondent\u201d on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d during Jon Stewart\u2019s tenure, is certainly familiar with ABC. He helped develop the network\u2019s hit comedy \u201c\u201d and was expected to be one of the show\u2019s top producers before being tapped by Comedy Central to host a show in Stephen Colbert\u2019s old time slot. That did not work out. \u201cThe Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore\u201d made its debut in January 2015, but Comedy Central canceled it in August because of falling ratings. \u201cDisney took a chance on me as a young writer years ago and so I\u2019m thrilled to return to the Mouse House,\u201d Mr. Wilmore said in a statement. \u201cI hope my room still looks the same. \u201d Mr. Wilmore is also an executive producer of HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d the Issa Rae comedy that was renewed for a second season this month.'"}, "time": 1742561814.5192184}
