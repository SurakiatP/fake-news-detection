It is a binding part of the identity in a nation built by immigrants. But despite the richness of the language, this   nation can find itself at a loss for contemporary terms. The venerated Academy of the Hebrew Language is always working to update a vocabulary inscribed on parchment for the digital era. Among the academy\u2019s latest crop, announced on Twitter this month, were Hebrew words for shaming (\u201cbiyush,\u201d an outgrowth of an existing verb, to shame) hashtag (\u201ctag hakbatza\u201d  \u2014   literally, group tag) and big data (\u201cnetunei atek\u201d). Israel\u2019s health minister recently made some enemies in the   industry when he came up with his own word for junk food: \u201cMcDonald\u2019s. \u201d The academy offered an alternative: \u201czlolet\u201d  \u2014   a combination of \u201czlila,\u201d or gluttony, and \u201czol,\u201d which means cheap. The experts also seek public comment, as in a recent plea for a new word to replace \u201cperipheria,\u201d from the English periphery, used to refer to geographical areas or socioeconomic groups that, the academy said, \u201care not central, or are far from the center. \u201d In general Israeli parlance, \u201cperipheria\u201d is often a synonym for governmental neglect. People were asked to vote online for or against the academy\u2019s suggestion: \u201cshula,\u201d derived from the word for margin. But Israelis overwhelmingly disapproved, noting that this term had the same negative connotations, and suggested alternatives. The most popular were variations on the word \u201cheikef,\u201d denoting scope or girth. Even for   correct grammar and pronunciation can be a matter of dispute or guesswork since Hebrew is mostly written without \u201cnikkud,\u201d or vowel signs. The academy says it receives more than 1, 300 queries a month from people working in government, the military and the legal system, and from teachers, translators, poets and even children. Some are hoping to win a bet about correct usage. Others are seeking help drafting invitations for happy occasions  \u2014   or, conversely, crafting inscriptions for tombstones.'"}, "time": 1742562034.523317}
