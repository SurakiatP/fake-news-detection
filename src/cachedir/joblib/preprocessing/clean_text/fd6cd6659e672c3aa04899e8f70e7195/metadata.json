Bursting forth variously over the years in pinstriped suit, in Roman tunic, or in Barbara Bush jumbo faux pearls and softly curled wig, he has earned perhaps the best perk of Broadway stardom: a welcoming round of applause from Jane and John Q. Public. So what was he doing on a recent Monday night, arriving on stage as a disembodied voice coming out of an   telephone? (One you actually talk on.) Mr. Lane plays the cynical, cantankerous editor Walter Burns in a new revival of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur\u2019s voluble 1928 newspaper comedy, \u201cThe Front Page,\u201d at the Broadhurst Theater on West 44th Street. That he doesn\u2019t appear in the flesh until the bottom of the second act, in a production that   the Johns Slattery and Goodman and runs almost three hours, frankly delights him. \u201cI\u2019m jumping on a speeding train  \u2014   they all have a head start,\u201d Mr. Lane said not long before curtain on a recent Monday, sitting in a back room of Joe Allen, the Midtown restaurant beloved by the theater crowd. He seemed to be hiding behind the stiff mustache he grew for the part. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a great character. And he sort of takes over the play till the end, the big Shakespearean finale, when things resolve and everything pays off in a wonderful way. \u201d At 60, Mr. Lane is enjoying a sense of resolution and payoff. He has been married for almost a year to Devlin Elliott, a playwright and producer he dated for almost two decades. \u201cMarried life is great,\u201d he said, after ordering some mineral water and vegetable soup. \u201cNothing major, nothing dramatic. It\u2019s a very subtle change. \u201d The ceremony took place at City Hall, with the comedian Mike Birbiglia and his wife, Jen Stein, another producer, as witnesses. \u201cI had thought, \u2018O. K. we\u2019ll do this, and we\u2019ll go have lunch,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lane said. \u201cAnd then I started to say those words that you\u2019ve heard in a thousand movies, and Devlin was fine, and I could barely get the words out. I got very, very emotional. It really got me. \u201d Like many actors  \u2014   heck, like many people  \u2014   Mr. Lane had a difficult childhood, with his father, a truck driver, drinking and dying young and his mother suffering a mental breakdown. He was born Joseph Lane and chose his name from the \u201cGuys and Dolls\u201d character Nathan Detroit, whom he ended up playing on Broadway in the musical\u2019s acclaimed 1992 revival. Growing up in Jersey City, N. J. he had two nurturing older bothers and found solace in farce (the first Broadway show he saw was Peter Shaffer\u2019s \u201cBlack Comedy,\u201d with Michael Crawford and Geraldine Page) and the past. \u201cYou know, when I was young, I was fascinated by the Algonquin Round Table, by all those witty alcoholics,\u201d he said, with a rueful laugh. \u201cWith all their personal problems, and yet they\u2019re all writers, they\u2019re all incredibly complicated. \u201d Unable to afford college despite a scholarship, Mr. Lane moved to New York in the fall of 1977, when the city was just turning itself around from the Ford to City: Drop Dead  years. He did summer stock and commercials, \u201cthousands of them. \u201d He delivered singing telegrams, including one to an Italian wedding. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve hit a new low when accordion players are heckling you,\u201d Mr. Lane said. But the guests asked him to stay, and laughed uproariously at his jokes. \u201cThey threw money,\u201d he said, with faint wonderment still. \u201cDollar bills. \u201d Following in the tradition of Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and the   Clark and McCullough, Mr. Lane formed a   duo with a friend named Patrick Stack. Stack and Lane went to Los Angeles, played the Comedy Store, opened for rock bands. \u201cAs an actor, you\u2019re dependent on people casting you, and in this case we had a product,\u201d Mr. Lane said, slurping some soup. The act broke up after he got a job on the sitcom \u201cOne of the Boys,\u201d with Mickey Rooney, a yet undiscovered Dana Carvey, and Meg Ryan in a recurring part. After the show flopped, Mr. Lane got his big Broadway break, with George C. Scott in a revival of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s \u201cPresent Laughter. \u201d He played \u201can aspiring young provincial playwright fond of leaping onto couches and giggling loonily,\u201d as Frank Rich put it in The New York Times, adding that he \u201calternately hits and overshoots his broad mark. \u201d Critics! Mr. Lane spoke with nostalgia of an era when \u201cthere was sort of a friendlier vibe\u201d between these creatures and playwrights, exemplified by the venerable Elliott Norton of Boston encouraging Neil Simon to add the Pigeon Sisters to the last act of \u201cThe Odd Couple. \u201d And of the old days when a company could tinker with a show out of town, as Mr. Lane himself did with Mr. Simon and \u201cLaughter on the 23rd Floor,\u201d before John and Jane Q. could record damning snippets and post them on the internet. Mr. Lane, who also reprised the role of Oscar Madison with his   in \u201cThe Producers,\u201d Matthew Broderick, has written the introduction to a forthcoming new edition of Mr. Simon\u2019s memoirs. \u201cHis editor said, \u2018You know, if you ever want to write your\u2019  \u2014   ha, ha  \u2014   \u2018memoir,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWell, no. I\u2019m not doing that. \u201d His work as an author has been limited to his collaborations with his husband, Mr. Elliott, on a children\u2019s book series, \u201cNaughty Mabel,\u201d about the insouciant French bulldog with whom they share an apartment in TriBeCa and a house in East Hampton, N. Y. Perhaps disappointingly for those who relish Mr. Lane\u2019s dexterity with a   there is no script of his own languishing in a drawer. \u201cI mean, I like making contributions, I\u2019m a great   man,\u201d he said, twirling an imaginary cigar. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard. They don\u2019t like you to change job titles. \u201d (As evinced, perhaps, by the cool reception he received for his version of Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove\u2019s adaptation of Aristophanes\u2019s \u201cThe Frogs. \u201d) \u201cI would lean more toward directing. Everyone keeps saying I have to direct something because I\u2019ve got a lot of opinions. \u201d Reached on the phone later, Jack O\u2019Brien, the actual director of \u201cThe Front Page,\u201d said he and Mr. Lane had been working to spit \u2018n\u2019 polish parts of the dense script. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of keeping 25 plates in the air,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said, noting that Mr. Lane, long renowned for making them laugh, has been of late going for roles like Theodore (Hickey) Hickman in Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s \u201cThe Iceman Cometh\u201d and, soon, another aficionado of the phone: Roy Cohn in a London production of Tony Kushner\u2019s \u201cAngels in America. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not just being an entertainer,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThese are Alps. These are mountains that actors with real ambition and real talent must scale. And he\u2019s taking himself seriously and doing it. \u201d Although \u201cThe Front Page\u201d is funny, preview audiences have been gasping at some of its speeches and, once Mr. Lane walks on stage, his tough love of Mr. Slattery, who plays the reporter prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Hildy Johnson. After various makeovers over the years  \u2014   Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner in \u201cSwitching Channels\u201d  \u2014   Hecht and MacArthur\u2019s work, about the framing of a white convict who killed a black policeman, has been fully restored to its naughty,   glory. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a more politically incorrect play,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt\u2019s misogynistic. It\u2019s everything. And appallingly isn\u2019t very different from our own time. \u201d It was \u201cthe play that uncorseted the American theater with its earthy,   vitality\u201d according to Tennessee Williams. \u201cBecause it was considered so profane and vulgar on a certain level,\u201d Mr. Lane said at Joe Allen. \u201cThey don\u2019t write \u2018em like this anymore. People will go, \u2018Oh, Jesus, no one would produce this.\u2019 Even though it\u2019s one set, so many things happen, people crashing through windows. \u201d The man who agreed to bring it back was Scott Rudin, whom Mr. Lane called \u201ca throwback to those guys,\u201d like the original producer of \u201cThe Front Page,\u201d the Machiavellian but brilliant Jed Harris. He was shivering a little in his woolen cardigan. \u201cIs it suddenly cold in here?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt really does feel like the early bird special. \u201d Mr. Lane called to a waitress. \u201cIs it possible to turn down the air?\u201d On the restaurant\u2019s brick wall of failure, the framed posters of infamous Broadway flops include one of Mr. Lane\u2019s early musical vehicles, \u201cThe Wind in the Willows,\u201d in which he played Toad of Toad Hall. The tagline: \u201cHear It With Your Heart. \u201d \u201cI used to say, \u2018Hear it with your heart, because you won\u2019t believe your ears,\u201d Mr. Lane said. Though now invited to lecture students, he is not mentoring anyone in particular. \u201cI don\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m married now. Ha, ha, ha,\u201d he added, all but twirling his mustache. \u201cI\u2019d like to mentor Ryan Gosling, if he has the time. \u201d Did he ever have a moment when he thought he\u2019d quit the profession? \u201cSaturday!\u201d he said. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t have dark moments?\u201d It was time to exit, and as he walked onto the sidewalk toward the theater, he seemed to shrink ever so slightly. \u201cOh, God, it\u2019s Monday. \u201d Mr. Lane said, standing in front of the stage door, just another salaryman. \u201cMondays can be shaky. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562650.600966}
