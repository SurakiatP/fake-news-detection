A   series on a major network about \u201cus\u201d? It\u2019s occasion for excitement, and for reflection. What, exactly, do we who live in the \u201cSpeechless\u201d universe hope this series will accomplish? \u201cSpeechless\u201d is a classic domestic comedy  \u2014   yes, a comedy  \u2014   centered on a    named JJ DiMeo who has cerebral palsy, can\u2019t speak and uses an   device to express himself. He\u2019s the eldest of three children, and he\u2019s played by Micah Fowler, who himself has cerebral palsy, a casting decision that alone makes this series stand out. Minnie Driver portrays his mother, Maya, who like a lot of parents of children with disabilities sometimes turns into a      warrior for her son. JJ has two siblings (Mason Cook and Kyla Kenedy) whose own needs tend to get overlooked, a common thing in such households. John Ross Bowie plays the father, Jimmy, who struggles to keep Maya from sailing off the edge. When ABC picked up this show last spring, word spread quickly through the chat rooms and Facebook pages where nonverbal people and their parents hang out. The YouTube trailer has had about 1. 5 million views. I watched the pilot episode over the summer at Camp Communicate in Maine, which is for children who use   devices. Staff members and campers watching with me agreed: Whoever\u2019s behind this show \u201cgets it. \u201d There\u2019s a reason for that: The show\u2019s creator, Scott Silveri, grew up in a home much like the one in \u201cSpeechless,\u201d with a nonverbal brother with cerebral palsy and other health issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a story that I\u2019ve been wanting to tell as long as I\u2019ve been writing,\u201d said Mr. Silveri, who has written and been a producer for \u201cFriends\u201d and other shows. \u201cNot so much focused on doing a story about disability I was really interested in doing a family show and exploring how one family member with a disability affects everybody else and turns them into the specific kind of weirdos that they become. \u201d It is largely unexplored territory. For decades, enduring TV characters with a disability were rare. Name one from the medium\u2019s first 50 years. \u201cIronside,\u201d says practically everyone. Name five more? Not so easy. When such characters did turn up, they were frequently used as objects of pity or as catalysts that allowed   characters to learn an obvious lesson or feel better about themselves. Making matters worse was that often,   actors would tackle these roles with embarrassing gusto. People who saw Rosie O\u2019Donnell playing a mentally challenged woman in the 2005 TV movie \u201cRiding the Bus With My Sister\u201d still haven\u2019t stopped cringing. Things have improved in recent years. Characters with disabilities are still underrepresented on TV (the Census Bureau says one in five Americans have a disability, with half of those describing the condition as severe) but credible ones have been built into \u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cSwitched at Birth,\u201d \u201cLegit,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and more. Yet here is a blunt truth: Some disabilities are more telegenic than others. Who doesn\u2019t love a high school kid singing in perfect harmony and   to \u201cProud Mary\u201d? Sure, Artie of \u201cGlee\u201d was a delight. Now take away his singing ability and his wheelchair dexterity and make him able to communicate only by laboriously aiming a   laser pointer at a communication board. That\u2019s JJ. That is a difficult character to make appealing, and putting him in network prime time in a central role is as bold, in its way, as television\u2019s first single mother or black lead or transgender story line was. A   ago, ABC took a similar risk with \u201cLife Goes On,\u201d about a family with a Down syndrome child, a role played by Chris Burke, who has Down syndrome. That show, though, was a drama, which is what \u201coutsiders\u201d might expect: Disability equals struggle equals nothing but pain and misery. We \u201cinsiders\u201d hate that. Yes, having a serious disability or caring for someone who does is hard, but hardship doesn\u2019t define that life. Just the other day, I laughed a couple of times, and so did my daughter, who has Rett syndrome. Mr. Silveri said the No. 1 reaction he has had from \u201cinside\u201d families when they hear about the show has been, \u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s a comedy. \u201d The casting of an actor with a disability has caused its own buzz, but Mr. Fowler won\u2019t merely be playing himself. He has a milder form of cerebral palsy than his character (he can speak, for instance) and had to study up on how JJ would move and use his device. Could an actor without a disability have done the same as credibly? For Mr. Fowler, there\u2019s no question. \u201cLiving every day with the challenges of a disability allows me to bring a rawness to the character and bring him to life with my unique perspectives,\u201d he said in an email interview. If actors with special needs will be pulling for the show, so will a lot of parents of children with disabilities. Ms. Driver is keenly aware of carrying those hopes. \u201cIt gives me goose bumps thinking that,\u201d she said. \u201cTo actually represent a body of people whose story hasn\u2019t been told  \u2014   that\u2019s very gratifying. \u201d Though I\u2019ve been writing as \u201cus,\u201d one thing you learn quickly when you have a child with a disability is that there is no \u201cdisability community\u201d the opinions, aspirations and beliefs within that world are as wildly divergent as in the population at large. So I won\u2019t presume to say what \u201cwe\u201d want \u201cSpeechless\u201d to accomplish only what I\u2019d like. I hope it gives another, especially hard, kick to the door that has made characters and actors with disabilities so scarce on TV. And I hope it helps break down the sense of isolation that envelops families like the DiMeos. Many people still either stare or look away when they see someone like JJ. I don\u2019t expect that those reactions will ever disappear. Maybe \u201cSpeechless\u201d will make them a little less common.'"}, "time": 1742562769.11291}
