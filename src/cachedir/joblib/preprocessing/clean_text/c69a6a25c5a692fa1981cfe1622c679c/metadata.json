[Andrea Pitzer, a contributor for Slate, wrote that Dylan\u2019s speech last week included plagiarized lines from an abridged summary of Moby Dick, the Herman Melville novel that the \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d singer has cited as a personally inspiring text.  One of the phrases used in the lecture, Pitzer writes, matches wording found on SparkNotes  \u2014   a study guide website that provides summaries of literature and other texts  \u2014   but is not, however, in the classic novel. From the lecture: \u201cSome men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness\u201d From SparkNotes: \u201csomeone whose trials have led him toward God rather than bitterness. \u201d Pitzer highlights at least 20 examples from Dylan\u2019s lecture of sentences and phrases that are similar to those found in the SparkNotes summary of the novel. The Nobel Foundation awarded Dylan the prestigious prize in October, which sparked considerable controversy over the very definition of literature, and and the enigmatic music legend didn\u2019t acknowledge the honor for weeks. The musician declined to attend December\u2019s Nobel ceremony in Stockholm, citing scheduling issues. The Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize, published Dylan\u2019s speech on June 5, in the form of a   recording, and called it \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201celoquent\u201d in a press release. The organization has not responded to the accusations. While Dylan has not responded to the accusations, however, he has been accused of borrowing phrases from other artists in the past. \u201cIt is nothing new that Mr. Dylan might take inspiration from a   work to prepare something else,\u201d Steven Weinberg, a copyright lawyer and musician, told the Associated Press. \u201cSongwriters, including Dylan, have been borrowing from other literary works to turn pop phrases for ages. Consider Led Zeppelin\u2019s ample use of Tolkien\u2019s classic works in many of their songs. \u201d The \u201csurprise here is that rather than borrowing from classic literature, Mr. Dylan took his \u2018inspiration\u2019 this time from crib notes,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cBut that should not raise eyebrows either. Even John Lennon was known to use things as ordinary as a newspaper clipping or circus posters to embellish lyrics. \u201d Listen to the lecture in full below:   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742561696.078375}
