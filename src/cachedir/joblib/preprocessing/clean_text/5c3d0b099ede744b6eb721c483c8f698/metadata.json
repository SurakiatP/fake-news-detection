Not a new iPhone, though, but a Samsung with a cracked screen, one that Shari Hunter and her husband, Anthony, bought with their tax refunds two years ago. \u201cAn iPhone and insurance are not the same thing at all,\u201d Ms. Hunter, 32, said. \u201cIf you need to be able to decide between an iPhone and health insurance, you need to look at: Why is that the choice?\u201d To Mr. Chaffetz\u2019s supporters, his comments sounded like a   defense of individual responsibility in the midst of a knockdown debate over the government\u2019s role in providing health care to Americans. To his critics, they sounded like a callous and obtuse dismissal of the hard choices that struggling families face every day  \u2014   and one that echoed earlier, racially noxious arguments over \u201cwelfare queens\u201d and criticisms of programs that helped provide phone service to poor people. The Hunters have thought plenty about trying to cut out the $100 they spend on cellphone service every month. Yes, they said, it\u2019s a lot, especially when they don\u2019t have health insurance and they stretch the last dollars from their $1, 800 monthly income to buy diapers and gasoline. But the cellphone tethers the couple together when Mr. Hunter leaves for his nearly $   job at a call center and Ms. Hunter stays home with their three children  \u2014   9, 4 and 3 years old  \u2014   here in the Utah Valley. They chat on his   breaks. It pains Mr. Hunter to be away from the children, so Ms. Hunter texts him photos of them making a snowman or playing on the backyard swing set. He sends her inspirational quotes from elders in the Mormon Church, to which they are both devoted. The Hunters said they voted for Mr. Chaffetz in November, but Mr. Hunter said his comment sounded like something a \u201c  person\u201d would say  \u2014   not a parent receiving food stamps, whose children are covered by Medicaid and who usually has $86 left over after paying the month\u2019s mortgage and other bills. Here in the heavily Mormon cities that run along the   Wasatch Range, several of Mr. Chaffetz\u2019s uninsured constituents said that, of course, they would love to be rid of the cellphone bills that cost their families $30, $50, $100 every month. But they said the savings would hardly be enough to afford monthly health plans for their families. And how would they get by without their phones? \u201cA cellphone is a lifeline,\u201d said Myla Dutton, executive director of Community Action Provo, a food bank and   nonprofit. Jose Valdivia, 61, said he wouldn\u2019t be able to quickly look up the latest engine modifications when he was repairing   vehicles at the mechanic\u2019s shop where he works. His wife said they wouldn\u2019t be able to send photos to relatives in Mexico City. The couple spoke as they waited for an appointment at a free health clinic run by volunteer nurses and doctors two nights a week in Provo. Not surprisingly, smartphones abounded in the waiting room. People texted about dinner, called relatives with updates, held their children\u2019s attention with a game. Without her phone, Joana Delacruz, 45, said, she wouldn\u2019t be able to see job postings from nursing employers, or check whether she should bring home some food for her    son after finishing her   p. m. shifts managing a McDonald\u2019s in Provo. Ms. Delacruz said she had not had health insurance since she lost her job as a nursing assistant after she fell over a wheelchair last July and hurt her back. Workers\u2019 compensation took care of the medical bills. But despite physical therapy and cortisone shots, her back still hurt, and she did not want to aggravate it by returning to a job that required lifting and moving patients. She earns about $1, 300 a month and has little left after paying $750 in rent (her son sometimes helps out) a $400 car payment and the $50 cellphone bill. The phone keeps her connected with her mother in Mexico. Her son texts her to remind her to get quarters for their building\u2019s laundry machines. She scans job postings that arrive in her inbox. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s for work. It\u2019s for relationships, it\u2019s for my kids, it\u2019s for my friends, everything. Life is hard to be by yourself. \u201d At home in Springville, the Hunters\u2019 phones buzzed at 7 a. m. on Friday with text messages of support. It was a big day: Mr. Hunter had been taking computer classes after work at the call center, and Friday was the day he would take a test for his A+ certification, the first step toward what the family hoped would be a   job working on computer systems. The texts were from the Hunters\u2019 \u201callies\u201d  \u2014   wealthier families who volunteer to provide social support to   families in the area. \u201cGood luck, Anthony,\u201d the messages read. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of you. You got this. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re praying for you. \u201d \u201cDid you text them back?\u201d Ms. Hunter asked her husband as he fried two eggs from their backyard henhouse. The couple said they had searched online but had been unable to find an affordable plan under the Affordable Care Act, and had paid tax penalties for not having insurance. They are both healthy, though when Mr. Hunter\u2019s   back pain flares up, he deals with it by lying on the floor, strapping on a back brace or getting a massage from his wife. They consider themselves conservative and think that health care should not be a federally mandated purchase, but should be left to individual states. If they lived one state over in Colorado, which expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, they might have qualified for it. Utah approved a small Medicaid expansion, but the Hunters said it did not cover them. On her cellphone, Ms. Hunter said, she frequently checks her family\u2019s bank account balances, updates her husband about filing their tax returns and sends notes of encouragement when he is gone. \u201cHe needs to know we believe in him,\u201d Ms. Hunter said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing. \u201d At 2:41 p. m. on Friday, two loaves of bread were baking in the oven, the two youngest children were playing in the living room, and Ms. Hunter was starting to chop potatoes for dinner when her phone chirped with news from her husband\u2019s test. It had not gone well. \u201cDo you know how far off you were?\u201d she texted. \u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cEnough. \u201d Mr. Hunter said he would get gas and head home. Retaking the test could cost more than $100, but they would talk about their next steps when he got home. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait,\u201d Ms. Hunter said, phone in hand. \u201cIt looks like he probably doesn\u2019t want to text. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561972.884791}
