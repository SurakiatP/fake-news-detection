As Ron Paul said when Alex Jones attempted to trick him into supporting Trump, \u201cDonald Trump would be the champion of the executive order.\u201d \\n\u201cHow many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!\u201d asks Hill. \\n\u201cOoh-rah!\u201d shouts back a dozen militia members. \\nAs the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton, reports Reuters. \\nHillary Clinton would likely attempt to disarm Americans if she is elected. But Donald Trump is certainly no champion of the second Amendment either as he and Clinton both agree on the illegal and due process-removing notion of banning people on the terror watch list from buying guns. \\nNo one is advocating that terrorists should have guns, but using an arbitrary list that people have no way of disputing to strip them of their rights is not only inefficient, but it is against the constitution. Where are the constitutionalists on this call by Trump? \\n\u201cI will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,\u201d said Hill, as he conveniently ignores Trump\u2019s anti-second amendment stance. \\nProtecting his fellow countrymen from a government who wishes to disarm them is most certainly an honorable stance. However, this stance should be universally applied and uncompromised \u2014 even if it means not supporting Donald Trump. \\n\u201cIf Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket,\u201d former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. But, if Trump wins, Walsh could be stripped of his second amendment with no due process when he gets put on a terror watch list. . @KevinBuist If a person is a suspected terrorist, then charge him and present evidence. \"Potential\" is punished only in dystopian novels. \\n\u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) June 16, 2016 \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been building up for this, just like the Marines,\u201d said Hill. \u201cWe are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.\u201d \\nUnfortunately, as long as people are willing to compromise on their principles to fight for the lesser of two evils, that day will most certainly come and Trump will do nothing to stop it. \\nThe good news is the three percenters seem to have the interests of the people in mind and Hill vowed to protect those who want to exercise their first Amendment by marching on Washington to protest in the event of a rigged election. \\nAs we\u2019ve already pointed out, Clinton\u2019s only chance of winning is doing exactly that \u2014 rigging the election. \\nBeginning in Iowa and eventually getting blown wide open in Arizona, the fraud and suppression of votes have already let Americans know that their rulers are selected not elected. \\nExamples of this fraud were captured on video, documented on paper, and even broadcast live on television. \\nA rigged election is almost a certainty and should most definitely be resisted. However, as long as Americans continue to buy into the political shitshow, that is the two-party paradigm, it will only continue to get worse \u2014 no matter the puppets in white marble buildings.
