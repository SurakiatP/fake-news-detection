He recently published a major study, \u201c How American Media Serves as a Transmission Belt for Wars of Choice .\u201d \\nPerhaps one of the most used and abused political expressions in recent years has been that of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d Politicians and commentators routinely invoke it as high principle and accuse their opponents of insufficient devotion to it, or contrariwise blame it for all the ills of the world. \\nFor example, in 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin ruffled many Americans\u2019 feathers: \\n\u201cIt is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. . . . We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord\u2019s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.\u201d \\nHillary Clinton weighed in on exceptionalism in an August speech before the American Legion, in which she also took a swipe at Donald Trump : \\nThe United States is an exceptional nation. . . . But, in fact, my opponent in this race has said very clearly that he thinks American exceptionalism is insulting to the rest of the world. In fact, when Vladimir Putin, of all people, criticized American exceptionalism, my opponent agreed with him, saying, and I quote, \u2018if you\u2019re in Russia, you don\u2019t want to hear that America is exceptional.\u2019 Well maybe you don\u2019t want to hear it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true. \\nIt needs to be asked, though: when people praise or criticize \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d are they always talking about the same thing? \\nAmerica, like any country, has its own distinctive history, culture, and traditions. America\u2019s unique founding principles\u2014consent of the governed, due process, constitutionally limited division of powers, representative government\u2014justly have been an inspiration to the world for over two centuries. Thomas Jefferson wrote of the \u201cpalpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God.\u201d \\nThis \u201cexceptional\u201d idea was new in human history. Any American worthy of the name justly takes pride in it. This is the genuine American exceptionalism of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, lately championed by Reagan. The fact that we have strayed so far from it, both domestically and internationally, is shameful. \\nThe unique moral revolution to which the Founding Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor has little connection to the bastard term (usually capitalized as \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism\u201d) that describes post-Cold War U.S. global behavior, by which policymakers in Washington assert both an exclusive \u201cleadership\u201d privilege and unsupportable obligation to undertake open-ended international missions in the name of the \u201cFree World\u201d and the \u201cinternational community.\u201d This is the counterfeit \u201cExceptionalism\u201d of a tiny clique of bipartisanapparatchiki\u2014GOP \u201cneoconservatives\u201d and Democrat \u201cliberal interventionists\u201d and their mainstream media mouthpieces \u2014who have little regard for our country\u2019s oldest traditions or the security and welfare of the American people. \\nThis second kind of Exceptionalism means that the rules we demand of other countries don\u2019t apply to us (so much for Jefferson\u2019s appeal in the Declaration of Independence to \u201ca decent respect to the opinions of mankind\u201d). Its proponents justify \u201cregime change\u201d in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Ukraine, maybe in Russia too . They have wasted trillions of Americans\u2019 tax dollars in the process of making us less safe, not more. Now the Obama Administration is willing to risk confronting Moscow and sparking a new world war in a bid to save al-Qaeda in Aleppo. As Trump has noted: \u201c You're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton .\u201d \\nIt is this debased and dangerous kind of Exceptionalism that Hillary represents. Closely related is her concept of America\u2019s \u201cindispensability\u201d : \\n\u201cWe are the indispensable nation. People all over the world look to us and follow our lead. . . . When America fails to lead, we leave a vacuum that either causes chaos or other countries or networks rush in to fill the void.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s no coincidence she is preferred by self-regarded indispensable hacks of both parties who have been up to their elbows in every foreign mess since Reagan. Starting next year, they are eager to give us more of the same. \\nFor genuine patriots, the true, uniquely American exceptionalism of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution is our precious inheritance. America\u2019s true exceptionalism is the antithesis of what Hillary and her acolytes intend, as attested by John Quincy Adams : \u201cWherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will [America\u2019s] heart, her benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.\u201d \\nIn scouring the world for monsters to destroy Hillary\u2019s perversion of authentic American principles has more in common with Soviet universalism than the vision of the Founders. In pursuing \u201c benevolent global hegemony \u201d the supposed indispensables suggest that other countries and peoples are dispensable\u2014or disposable. In the process, Americans\u2019 freedoms have become disposable too. This is, in a word, un-American\u2014a good old expression that needs to make a comeback. \\nGenuine American exceptionalism and the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies of Donald Trump don\u2019t mean our withdrawal from the world. U.S. primacy in a multipolar system is something most countries, including Russia and China, would be prepared to accept, however grudgingly. But continuing down the road Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush have blazed for a quarter century promises us just more war, more enemies, and eventual catastrophe. It\u2019s a mistake America cannot afford to make. Did you enjoy this article? - Consider helping us!
