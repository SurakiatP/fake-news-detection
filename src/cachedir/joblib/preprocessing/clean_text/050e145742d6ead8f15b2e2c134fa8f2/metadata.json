Trump appeared to soften some of his   campaign positions on immigration on Sunday, but he also restated his pledge to roll back abortion rights and used Twitter to lash out at his critics, leaving open the possibility that he would continue using social media in the Oval Office and radically change the way presidents speak to Americans. In his first   television interview since his upset victory on Tuesday, Mr. Trump repeated his promise to name a Supreme Court justice who opposed abortion rights and would help overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that recognized them, returning the issue to the states. Asked where that would leave women seeking abortions, Mr. Trump, on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d said, \u201cWell, they\u2019ll perhaps have to go  \u2014   they\u2019ll have to go to another state. \u201d On immigration, he said the wall that he has been promising to build on the nation\u2019s southern border might end up being a fence in places. But he said his priority was to deport two million to three million immigrants he characterized as dangerous or as having criminal records, a change from his original position that he would deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. President Obama has deported more than two million undocumented immigrants during his time in office. Mr. Trump said that undocumented immigrants who are not criminals are \u201cterrific people,\u201d and that he would decide how to handle them after the border is secure. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, echoed the   saying on Sunday that there would be no deportation force, something Mr. Trump had promised to create early in his campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re focused on,\u201d Mr. Ryan said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union. \u201d Mr. Trump also said he considered the Supreme Court decision last year that validated   marriages as settled, and that he was \u201cfine with that. \u201d He endorsed popular aspects of President Obama\u2019s health insurance law, including a provision that requires coverage of people with   medical conditions and one that allows young people to remain on their parents\u2019 plans until the age of 26. But even as he appeared to inch toward the political center, Mr. Trump used a series of postings on Twitter to argue that The New York Times\u2019s coverage of him has been \u201cBAD\u201d and \u201cvery poor and highly inaccurate. \u201d He falsely stated that The Times had issued an apology to readers, an apparent reference to a letter to readers from The Times\u2019s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and its executive editor, Dean Baquet. The letter noted the unpredictable nature of the election and said The Times aimed to \u201crededicate\u201d itself to \u201cthe fundamental mission of Times journalism. \u201d In the letter, The Times posed a series of what it called inevitable questions, including, \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d Mr. Trump also claimed that the newspaper had been losing thousands of subscribers over its campaign coverage. In a Twitter message in reply to Mr. Trump, The New York Times Company said it had seen a \u201csurge\u201d in new subscriptions since the election  \u2014   four times the   rate. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our election coverage  we will continue to \u2018hold power to account,\u2019\u201d  the company said. Mr. Trump, in another Twitter post, said The Times had falsely reported that he believed additional nations should acquire nuclear arms. However, in an interview in March with The Times, Mr. Trump, asked about the North Korean threat to its neighbors, said he thought the United States\u2019 allies might need their own nuclear deterrent. \u201cIf Japan had that nuclear threat, I\u2019m not sure that would be a bad thing for us,\u201d he said. Later, he added, \u201cThe bottom line is, I think that frankly, as long as North Korea\u2019s there, I think that Japan having a capability is something that maybe is going to happen whether we like it or not. \u201d His posts on Twitter were a striking public display from a man who, after winning the election, had worked to project an air of seriousness and   first in a victory speech early Wednesday and then in an Oval Office meeting the next day with Mr. Obama, whom he called a \u201cgood man\u201d for whom he had \u201cgreat respect. \u201d But by Thursday evening, Mr. Trump was using Twitter to complain about demonstrations against his victory, saying they were being mounted by \u201cprofessional protesters, incited by the media,\u201d and branding them as \u201cvery unfair!\u201d The social media sniping  \u2014   unparalleled in the history of presidential communication  \u2014   suggested that Mr. Trump plans to bring his confrontational style of speaking to Americans to the White House, working to undercut news outlets that do not comport with his views, silence his critics and elevate his own standing. On Sunday, he selected Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a site known for its nationalist, racially charged and   coverage, to be his chief strategist and senior counselor. It was only one indication of the extraordinary nature of the  \u2019s tactics and those of his inner circle. In the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Mr. Trump suggested he would not hold to the longstanding   tradition of presidents refraining from interfering in F. B. I. criminal matters, hinting that he would quiz the director, James B. Comey, about his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server before deciding whether to dismiss him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Mr. Trump said when asked if he would seek Mr. Comey\u2019s resignation. \u201cI would have to see  \u2014   he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did. \u201d In an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump did not rule out prosecuting Mrs. Clinton. On Sunday, his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, warned that Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the minority leader, could face legal action for having said that Mr. Trump\u2019s election had \u201cemboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America. \u201d Mr. Trump has said he is proud of how he has used social media to create his own version of events and communicate it to his followers. He suggested in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that he is reluctant to surrender that platform when he takes the oath of office in January. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Twitter during the interview, adding that his millions of followers on various social media sites had given him \u201csuch power\u201d that it helped him win the election. \u201cWhen you give me a bad story, or when you give me an inaccurate story,\u201d Mr. Trump added, \u201cI have a method of fighting back. \u201d He said, however, that he would be \u201cvery restrained\u201d in his Twitter posts should he continue to make them as president. Mr. Trump is a highly public scorekeeper of his own accolades and accomplishments, and his elevation to the highest office in the land has not changed his instinct to crow about the smallest details. During the interview, Mr. Trump boasted that since his election, he had built up his social media following by tens of thousands of people. \u201cI\u2019m picking up now  \u2014   I think I picked up yesterday 100, 000 people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The interview, which also featured Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, and adult children, showed a side of the   that he did not display during the campaign  \u2014   a man awed and somewhat intimidated by the significance of the office to which he had just laid claim. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of big things I\u2019ve never done anything like this,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt is  \u2014   it is so big, it is so  \u2014   it\u2019s so enormous, it\u2019s so amazing. \u201d Mr. Trump said he had been inaccurately portrayed as \u201ca little bit of a wild man\u201d during the campaign, and he promised that he would be able to tamp down some of his more heated speech as president. But he suggested that he would still use such tactics to galvanize his supporters, just as he did during his bid for the White House. \u201cSometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be just a little nice monotone character. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564192.798815}
