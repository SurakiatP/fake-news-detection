It\u2019s gathered enough signatures to be officially reviewed by the authorities. \\n\u201cWith a street named after Donald Trump we can make Ryazan great again,\u201d said one of the supporters of the petition. \\n\u201cI\u2019m signing because I was born in Ryazan and Trump is a great person and will change everything for the better,\u201d said another. \\nHere is a loosely translated version of the petition from Google translate: \\nDespite the enthusiasm among many, some residents were slightly less supportive of the \u201cStreet of Donald Trump\u201d idea and suggested that the town would end up \u201clooking like idiots\u201d if Trump imposed sanctions against Russia. \\nSome commenters, however, expressed caution: \u201cYou should have waited to see Trump\u2019s first moves. What if he will support the sanctions against Russia? You will look like idiots then.\u201d \\nDespite the petition\u2019s popularity, a city official thinks it\u2019s unlikely the street will actually be renamed. \u201cAccording to Ryazan city regulations,\u201d the official said, \u201cthe street can be named after a famous person, Russian or foreign, only five years after the death of this person\u201d. \\nMeanwhile, here in the U.S., a 15-year-old student at Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, Maryland had to be rushed to the hospital after being beaten up by 4 other students for wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. \\nHundreds of students from Richard Montgomery High School were carrying signs reading, \u201cLove Trumps Hate,\u201d and chanting near the Rockville courthouse on Maryland Avenue in a protest that began at about 10 a.m. when a 15-year-old boy wearing one of the Trump campaign\u2019s \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d hats was attacked by about four students. \\nThe group surrounded the teen, punching him repeatedly, then threw him to the ground and kicked him repeatedly in the ribs. \\n\u201cThey jumped him and beat him up pretty bad,\u201d Max Stucky, a bystander who witnessed the attack, told WTOP. \\nThe teen, who wasn\u2019t seriously hurt, was seen clutching the back of his head in pain. He was helped to his feet by medics and taken to a hospital in an ambulance. \\nAnd still no word from Obama and Clinton on this senseless violence\u2026we\u2019re still waiting\u2026 Related '"}, "time": 1742564492.3814466}
