[\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent lies and propaganda,\u201d Ayrault said during a visit to Beijing, responding to an exclusive AFP interview with Assad on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent cruelty and cynicism. \u201d The French minister mirrored language used by Assad himself, who dismissed the allegation that his regime perpetrated the attack that left 87 civilians dead, including many children. \u201cDefinitely, 100 percent for us, it\u2019s fabrication,\u201d Assad said in the interview. The Syrian leader questioned whether the attack had in fact occurred, claiming that \u201cfake videos\u201d and \u201cpropaganda\u201d were being used against his government. He also accused the United States of colluding with terrorists and \u201cfabricating the whole story in order to have a pretext\u201d for a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base last week. The French minister made the remarks during a joint press conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. \u201cThe reality is that more than 300, 000 have died, 11 million people have been displaced or become refugees, tens of thousands have been placed in Syrian prisons and a country has been destroyed,\u201d Ayrault said. \u201cThat is the reality. It is not a fantasy. \u201d He emphasised the need for an end to the conflict with a \u201creal ceasefire, one which restricts the Syrian air force and military and is upheld by the international community. \u201d Ayrault praised China\u2019s role in the matter, noting its abstention from a United Nations Security Council vote on a resolution to condemn the Syrian gas attack. In the past, China has voted alongside Russia to veto UN resolutions on the Syrian conflict. Wang expressed his agreement with the French minister, noting that an \u201cindependent, fair and professional investigation\u201d into the chemical weapons attack should be conducted \u201cas soon as possible. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562272.8925989}
