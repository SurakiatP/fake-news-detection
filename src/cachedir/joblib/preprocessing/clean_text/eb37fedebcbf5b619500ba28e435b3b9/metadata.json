But other areas, notably the ISDS/ICS, must wait for full ratification of the deal. That requires all of the EU\u2019s 28 member states to go through national ratification processes, which will probably take several years\u201d [ Ars Technica ]. \u201cAnd despite what the commission would have you think, it is by no means certain that all the national parliaments will approve CETA.\u201d More: \\nFor example, a tweet by Katharina Nocun pointed out that left-wing and green parties could block its passage in Germany. At various times, there have been hints that other countries\u2019 parliaments may not agree to the deal, but it\u2019s not yet clear what the current situation is around the EU\u2026.. \\nAnother serious threat to CETA\u2019s coming into force are legal challenges. As part of the deal to obtain Wallonia\u2019s permission to sign CETA, the EU agreed that the ICS framework would be examined by the EU\u2019s highest court, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). If the CJEU finds that the approach is incompatible with the EU\u2019s fundamental principles, it will either have to be dropped from CETA (and TTIP ), or CETA itself will fall (as will TTIP). \\nIn addition, there are two constitutional challenges to CETA, one in Canada , and one in Germany. \\nGood wrap-up of the state of play. \\nTTIP: \u201d A much-debated trade deal between the European Union and the United States is not dead and negotiations will continue with the new U.S. administration after November\u2019s elections, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Saturday\u201d [ Reuters ].

They are last week\u2019s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers. \\nThe class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn\u2019t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent. \\nThey are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves. \\nThe good people. \\nStats Watch \\nPurchasing Managers\u2019 Manufacturing Index, October 2016: \u201cA marked upturn in new orders leads a very positive manufacturing PMI\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cThe increase in orders is centered in domestic demand though export orders also improved. Backlogs are another plus, rising to the best level in three months\u2026. Based on this report, the manufacturing sector, after a flat year, is now accelerating into year end.\u201d But: \u201cThere is nothing in the ISM or Markit reports that would leave one to think manufacturing is on the mend\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nInstitute For Supply Management Manufacturing Index, October 2016: \u201cISM\u2019s manufacturing sample reported no better than moderate conditions [below consensus]. But new orders are a disappointment, still showing monthly growth but at a much slower rate\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cThe construction sector, despite unusually low mortgage rates, has been struggling this year with the softness in single-family housing posing continued challenges for what is otherwise a strong new home market.\u201d And: \u201d ISM employment index is not useful in understanding manufacturing jobs growth. The ISM employment index appears useful in predicting turning points which can lead the BLS data up to one year\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nNew Normal: \u201cAnother factor, too, is the productive capacity that was built up to support a consumption engine that is no longer running at full tilt. Companies have more equipment and infrastructure than they are currently using, and with unused capacity, there is little reason to invest in new equipment or technologies. This helps explain the weak rate of capital spending in GDP \u2013 and may also help answer the vexing question of why productivity gains are so anemic. After all, productivity might be enhanced by innovation, which requires research and investment\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nConstruction Spending, September 2016: \u201cConstruction spending remains weak but indications on housing do show limited improvement\u201d [ Econoday ]. And: \u201cwell below the consensus forecast\u201d [ Econintersect ]. But: \u201cOverall, however \u2013 construction is now contracting after spending nearly 5 years expanding year-over-year.

Results indicated a pattern of discrimination, which we observed in Seattle through longer waiting times for African American passengers\u2014as much as a 35 percent increase. In Boston, we observed discrimination by Uber drivers via more frequent cancellations against passengers when they used African American-sounding names. Across all trips, the cancellation rate for African American sounding names was more than twice as frequent compared to white sounding names.\u201d \\nPolitical Risk: \u201cVariations in the market\u2019s performance under Democratic and Republican administrations, measured by the average of yearly returns over more than 160 years, are so small as to be negligible, said Vanguard senior investment strategist Jonathan Lemco, a former professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. \u201cA recent survey did show that the election ;is causing U.S. voters high anxiety . ;But according to readings of the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, the level of market anxiety is pretty normal, said Lemco.

Some of those companies resell the information\u2014mostly to marketers, but also to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Some of these authorities use the data to track dissidents, as Bloomberg Businessweek has learned through dozens of interviews with industry insiders and more than 100 requests for public records from law enforcement agencies in the U.S. There\u2019s nothing illegal about selling Twitter data, but it\u2019s uncomfortable for a company that promotes itself as a medium for free speech and protest.\u201d One more reason Twitter should be a coop? \\nStanding Rock and #NoDAPL \\n\u201cDid #DAPL Security Worker Wielding an AR-15 Rifle Try to Infiltrate Native Water Protectors?\u201d [ Democracy Now!] \u201d More details are emerging from Thursday, including video footage of a man who appears to be a Dakota Access security contractor holding a rifle, with his face covered by a bandana, apparently attempting to infiltrate a group of water protectors. A Standing Rock Sioux tribal member says he saw the man driving down Highway 1806 toward the main resistance camp with an AR-15 rifle on the passenger side of his truck. Protectors chased down his truck and then pursued him on foot in efforts to disarm him. In the video, the man can be seen pointing the rifle at the protectors as he attempts to flee into the water. He was ultimately arrested by Bureau of Indian Affairs police.

I know that it can feel quite personal to Mac devotees, like me, but it\u2019s simply business and strategy.\u201d In other words, the rollout wasn\u2019t a debacle; Apple has decided it doesn\u2019t want to serve the professional market any more (including, one would have thought critically, the market in content creation). Since the Mac accounts for 10% of Apple\u2019s revenues, that may be a rational business decision.

The ultimate strength of the Mac was always the Human Interface Guidelines \u2014 gradually being crapified as iOS idioms infest OS X \u2014 which imposed a similar \u201clook and feel\u201d across all applications that ran on the Mac platform.
