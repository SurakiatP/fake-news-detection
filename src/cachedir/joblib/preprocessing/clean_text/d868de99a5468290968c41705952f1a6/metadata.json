S. government\u2019s war on coal in direct contravention of directions from President Donald Trump. [\u201cCoal doesn\u2019t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock,\u201d Cohn said in Europe on Air Force One, while speaking for the White House to the press, the New York Times\u2019 Brad Plumer noted.  \u201cNatural gas, which we have become an abundant producer, which we\u2019re going to become a major exporter is, is such a cleaner fuel,\u201d Cohn continued. Trump adviser Gary Cohn a bit   on Air Force One, per pool report: \u201cCoal doesn\u2019t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock\u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   brad plumer (@bradplumer) May 26, 2017,  Cohn\u2019s comments against the coal industry come as he has attempted to steer President Trump in a direction against his campaign promise to remove the United States from the Paris Climate Accords, a deal that Sen. Rand Paul ( ) has told Breitbart News would cost at least six million American jobs. Paul and 21 of his GOP U. S. Senate colleagues have written to President Trump urging him to follow through on his pledge to remove the U. S. from the   deal and stand up for the coal industry in the United States. Trump repeatedly campaigned on defending coal workers \u2014  people previous presidents and his Democratic opponent former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton worked to undermine. Former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration \u2014  was brutal to the coal  industry \u2014  something Clinton campaigned on continuing. As the Trump administration has made great strides in rolling back   regulations on the coal industry, moving the government out of the way, President Trump announced to the American people back at the end of March that \u201cthe war on coal is over. \u201d But it seems the war on coal is being relaunched by his economic adviser Cohn, who now calls coal obsolete and unclean. Cohn\u2019s comments are sure to cause serious backlash among Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, since there is bipartisan support nationwide for protecting coal workers.'"}, "time": 1742561795.2786071}
