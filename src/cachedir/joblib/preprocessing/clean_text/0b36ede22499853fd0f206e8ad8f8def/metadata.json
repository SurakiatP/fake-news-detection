The news agency, SANA, said the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had destroyed part of the theater and severely damaged a tetrapylon, a square structure of four plinths, each with four columns. The agency said the tetrapylon had two columns still standing and appeared to have been \u201cintentionally destroyed using explosives. \u201d The smashing of the ancient structures was a further attempt by the group to impose its will by destroying monuments or artifacts that it says do not conform to its strict interpretation of Islam. The group\u2019s demolition of historic sites in Iraq, Libya, Syria and elsewhere has drawn international opprobrium Unesco has branded the actions \u201ccultural cleansing. \u201d The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, said the destruction of the two sites in Palmyra appeared to have taken place on Jan. 11. The observatory said the acts could have been a demonstration of force before the militant group, which is under siege in Iraq and in Syria, retreats from the city. The Islamic State retook Palmyra in December, nine months after Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, pushed the group out. The militant group had terrorized citizens and destroyed numerous priceless remains in the desert city, declared a World Heritage site by Unesco. The targeting of Palmyra\u2019s cultural treasures has particular resonance as the city\u2019s heritage, which embodies Greek, Persian, Roman and Islamic cultures, is a vivid symbol of a prewar, multicultural Syria that is anathema to the Islamic State\u2019s brutal and monolithic worldview. Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syria\u2019s director general of antiquities and museums, called Friday for the world to save Palmyra from further destruction. \u201cISIS is destroying Palmyra, building after building,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, their goal was ideological,\u201d he added, but as the group is steadily losing territory, it has become a matter of \u201crevenge. \u201d The Islamic State captured Palmyra in May 2015, and it quickly started targeting cultural sites and killing soldiers and some residents who had been left behind. In a matter of months, the militants began to plunder and destroy ancient artifacts, including the    Arch of Triumph, once a popular draw for tourists, and the nearly    Temple of Baalshamin. At the time, Unesco\u2019s director general, Irina Bokova, said the destruction of the Arch of Triumph \u201cshows how extremists are terrified by history and culture. \u201d Celebrated as the \u201cPearl of the Desert,\u201d Palmyra, about 150 miles northeast of Damascus, was once a refuge for travelers on the Silk Road, the ancient trade route. Temples have stood in Palmyra for thousands of years.'"}, "time": 1742562299.8774416}
