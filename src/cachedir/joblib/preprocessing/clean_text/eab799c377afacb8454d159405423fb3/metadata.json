The Trump Nationalist Vision, Ascendant  It\u2019s an obvious fact: Donald Trump hasn\u2019t even been sworn in as the 45th President, and yet, already, he\u2019s setting the national agenda. Through Twitter, other social media, and the occasional public appearance, he\u2019s still doing what he did throughout the presidential campaign \u2014  dominating.  Only now, as he says, he\u2019s doing it not for himself, but for the American people.     In recent weeks, Trump has struck   deals with Carrier and Ford.  Hence this revealing January 3 headline: \u201cChided by Trump, Ford scraps Mexico factory, adds Michigan jobs. \u201d He\u2019s also announced a $50 billion, 50, 000 jobs deal with Japanese investor Masayoshi Son and has just touted a new   plan from Fiat Chrysler.  Yet at the same time, Trump is using sticks, as well as carrots.  He has made it clear that any company that takes jobs out the country will be lambasted for doing so.  As he said in his January 11 press conference,  The word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio . . . it\u2019s not going to happen that way anymore. And in that same press conference, he went after the pharmaceutical companies for charging too much.  And he had a   solution: \u201cWhat we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry, because they\u2019re getting away with murder. \u201d And of course, he has chastised defense contractors Boeing and Lockheed, which he believes have been asking too much from the taxpayers. The result of this \u201ctweet therapy\u201d has been an overhaul of thinking in Corporate America.  Surveying Trump\u2019s new style of presidential bully pulpiteering, Reuters concludes, \u201cCorporate leaders . . . can no longer focus only on maximizing shareholder value they must now also weigh national interest. \u201d Yes, that\u2019s correct: American business executives are now getting a crash course in economic patriotism they can no longer act as if they aren\u2019t citizens of this country \u2014  or that other US citizens don\u2019t matter.  Because of Trump, they must now take into account the overall strength and   of the nation in which they reside.   And here\u2019s the interesting thing: Trump\u2019s     activism is also proving to be  .  It\u2019s a win for all three sectors call it a national   .  And it only makes sense: If there are more American workers with big paychecks buying things and paying their fair share of taxes, that\u2019s good both for American business and for Uncle Sam\u2019s budget.  Indeed, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, small business optimism has \u201cskyrocketed,\u201d and consumer confidence is also up meanwhile, the dollar is up, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 2000 points since the election.  So it\u2019s fully evident that the American economy is responding positively to Trump as   .  And President Trump will be joined in his administration, of course, by a slew of other successful dealmakers.   Yes, it\u2019s interesting to think back on the old ways of the federal government, the   ways.  That is, the feds have been interventionist on so many matters for so long, and yet they were  almost entirely   when it came to good jobs and wages corporations were free to come and go \u2014  mostly, go.  The message to employers was, in effect, Do whatever you want to your    workers, but you must, at all costs, protect wetlands, spotted owls, and the feelings of \u201cprotected victims\u201d and their free choice of bathrooms.  Thankfully, that strange and unfair policy choice by Uncle Sam \u2014  to ignore the interests of the broad middle class while catering to ever more     \u2014  seems to be coming to an end.   So it\u2019s possible, perhaps even likely, that under President Trump we will once again become a nation for all Americans \u2014  even Middle Americans.  We could yet be the \u201ccity on a hill\u201d that Ronald Reagan so eloquent described.  That is, a true   \u201cTeam America,\u201d united in its determination to work hard and do well, with US citizens coming first.  As Trump said in his press conference on Wednesday, his victory was \u201ca movement like the world has never seen before . . . that was a beautiful thing on November 8. \u201d 2. The Old Globalist Vision, Descendant  Of course, not everyone thinks that what happened on Election Day 2016 was a beautiful thing, because they have been living their lives according to a vision much different than Trump\u2019s economic nationalism. Let\u2019s get specific.  We can start with Barack Obama for the last eight years, as we know, Obama never worried much about the middle class, or, for that matter, about America.  Instead, his eyes were on a different prize: the vision of a relentlessly globalized world, in which the US would fit in . . . somewhere.  Here\u2019s how the 44th president expressed himself in his first inaugural address, back in 2009:  As the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.   That might be a nice thought to have in some academic ivory tower, but in the real world, there\u2019s precious little evidence that the polyglot peoples of the planet agree on much of anything, let alone how to usher in a new era of peace.  Heck, even Obama, having received a Nobel Peace Prize for making nice speeches, immediately escalated that forlorn war in Afghanistan.  Yet still, in his dogmatically ideological mind,  he was determined to shrink American power so that it would \u201cplay its role\u201d in this new global order.  And so in April 2009, the president was at pains to deny that \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d was anything worth taking note of, let alone being proud of.   Instead, he snarked that \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d was an illusion, because all countries see themselves as exceptional.  Obama\u2019s dismissiveness inspired one reporter to observe,  If all countries are \u201cexceptional,\u201d then none are, and to claim otherwise robs the word, and the idea of American exceptionalism, of any meaning. And yet again, Obama\u2019s comments made perfect sense, if we see that his goal was to cubbyhole the United States as just another country on the world stage, somewhere between Uganda and Uzbekistan.  So of course, Obama devoted his first few months in office to a worldwide \u201capology tour,\u201d although many say that it lasted, really, for his entire eight years in the White House.  John Fonte, a conservative critic of globalism at the Hudson Institute, calls this ideology \u201ctransnational progressivism,\u201d and it certainly defines the progressive worldview. Indeed, if we dig deeper, we can see that globalism is, in fact, a kind of religion. Everyone has heard, whether they wanted to or not, that 1971 John Lennon song, \u201cImagine,\u201d including these   lyrics:   Imagine there\u2019s no countriesIt isn\u2019t hard to doNothing to kill or die forAnd no religion, too. This \u201cLennonism,\u201d to be sure, is shared by many around the world.  Thus it\u2019s little wonder that Obama made common cause with other globalists, including former British prime minister David Cameron, German chancellor Angela Merkel, and European Union chief   Juncker.  These are the people who presided over the creation, or the elevation, of various murky transnational enterprises, including the United Nations, the European Union, the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, aka, the Iran nuclear deal.  The common thread running through all these bureaucratic contraptions is the   \u201cdemocracy deficit. \u201d  That is, in the mind of the elite, the fewer real people, including in the US, who get to vote on, or otherwise scrutinize, the doings of these bureaucracies, the better.    Indeed, it\u2019s also best, the elite thinks, if people never even learn the truth about what\u2019s being done in their name.  We can cite, for example, the issue of refugees.  To globalists, it\u2019s a point of honor to accept refugees, even with the prospect of subsidizing forever, in unassimilated dependency.  So we can readily see that Germany\u2019s Merkel is, in the globalist   hierarchy, the most \u201chonorable. \u201d  Yet, as we know, the Obama administration has done its best to keep up.  And if these   programs aren\u2019t popular with the public, well, the standard elite instinct is to mislead and deceive.  In the mind of these deceivers, it\u2019s all for the greater good because the ideal of the sacred \u201cglobal village\u201d is never better off if the \u201cdeplorables\u201d get to decide anything.   It\u2019s been well documented that the US government has been hiding the truth about the crimes of refugees, the health of refugees, and even the actual number of refugees.  Is anyone in the Obama administration the least bit apologetic for these dishonest abuses?  Of course not.  And yet, of course, in light of the recent election results, in which   globalism was decisively rejected, we have to ask: Did the elite really think that they would get away with it?  Did they really think that people wouldn\u2019t notice what has been happening to their communities and neighborhoods?  The answer seems to be, \u201cYes\u201d \u2014  the Obamans truly believed that they could get way with it.  They thought that Trump would be buried by a blue demographic wave in 2016, and that Hillary Clinton would be continuing their favored globalist policies in 2017.  To which we can say: Perhaps the elite aren\u2019t as smart as they think they are.  And yet, of course, even after being booted out of power, the Obama globalists will enjoy a soft landing: Many of them will soon be working for some George   think tank, or pressure group.  And from those cushy perches, they will be able to keep up their \u201cresistance\u201d to Trump (more on this in the next two installments). Now we cite a second sacred item on the globalist agenda: international free trade.  And here we see, once again, that elite thinking on globalism has a way of turning a theory into a transcendentally moral first principle.  And it\u2019s been this way for a long time.   Back in 1846, the leading British free trader Richard Cobden declared,   that free trade would save the world:  I see in the   principle that which shall act on the moral world as the principle of gravitation in the universe \u2014  drawing men together, thrusting aside the antagonism of race, and creed, and language, and uniting us in the bonds of eternal peace. Cobden was a capitalist, and capitalists are often   but, as we can see, there\u2019s a dreamy, even giddy, utopianism in Cobden\u2019s thinking.  And amazingly, it won the battle of public opinion in   Britain.  Interestingly, one contemporary of Cobden\u2019s \u2014  who was much   and decidedly not a capitalist \u2014  nevertheless endorsed the same idea.  That would be Karl Marx, the founder of communism.  As a theoretical prognosticator, Marx may have had a mistaken view of what communism would become in the future, and yet, nevertheless, he was a shrewd observer of current events.   Marx could see that unchecked and unbalanced   capitalism would quickly pulverize cultures, traditions, even whole nations in an endless gale of creative destruction.  That is, individuals might be better off in some material ways, but, as a community, they would be atomized and unhinged.  In the meantime, Marx continued, left to their own devices, untrammeled free markets would  concentrate most of the wealth in the hands of speculators and other financialists.  And so a result, Marx concluded, the masses, in their vexation, would be ready to experiment with socialism and then communism.   With that   Red scenario in mind, Marx declared in a famous 1848 speech, \u201cGentlemen, I am in favor of free trade. \u201d Yet today, the most ardent proponents of free trade aren\u2019t   communists they are   globalists, and they are achingly sincere.  Some might be Democrats, some might be Republicans, some might think of themselves as liberal, some might identify as conservatives.  Yet what unites them all is a vision of a borderless world, with minimal restrictions on exports and imports.  (And, of course, minimal restrictions on the transit, also, of people.)  To be sure, some globalists, such as the EU\u2019s   Juncker, have turned globalism into a profitable ideology for years now, Juncker has been in the middle of efforts by his home country, Luxembourg, to become the world\u2019s most   tax haven.  So yes, there\u2019s plenty of   in globalism.   And yet at the same time, there\u2019s more than that \u2014  much more. 3. The Gospel of Globalism, Indeed, this globalist faith is so strong that one can fairly conclude that it\u2019s more than an ideology \u2014  it must be a kind of theology.   As writer Fay Voshell suggested last September in American Thinker, globalism, for many, is a kind of transmuted Christianity. That is, globalism is a new kind of faith:   Replacing the beatific vision of Christianity is a new universal . . . an order in which human beings\u2019 allegiance is to a global City of Men ruled by elite priests who act as gods for the masses.  Preachers of the globalist vision present an ersatz kingdom . . . The religion of globalism sees an earthly, utopian world order in which all men pay allegiance to elite priests who rule over a World City without national borders.  Sometimes the substitute beatific vision is expressed in terms of a \u201cglobal village,\u201d a mystical entity that takes the place of the family of God.  The globalists\u2019 family of humanity is without distinction of country, tribe or creed. Those last words, \u201cwithout distinction of country, tribe or creed,\u201d take us right back to where we started \u2014  with John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine. \u201d  For the globalists, this vision is so powerful that it\u2019s easy to see how they  would be inspired to do exactly what they have done: open their borders, impose political correctness on their people, and transform their societies through vast   schemes.  Indeed, as we have seen, globalist political leaders are so committed to their beliefs that they  are even willing to risk losing elections, sacrificing their careers on the altar of their faith.  And that\u2019s just what happened with the Brexit vote in June, which not only put Britain on a course to leave the European Union, but also cost David Cameron his high office at Number 10 Downing Street.  And here in the US in November, the same thing happened to Hillary Clinton \u2014  and to Barack Obama\u2019s legacy.  Given the passionate depths of globalist sentiments, it\u2019s little wonder that the elites took those defeats with bitter dismay.   In the United Kingdom, for example, the beginning of the angry globalist response was to put a permanent hex on the leader of Brexit, Nigel Farage.   And oh yes, you might have noticed: Here in the US, the elite is just as angry at Trump.  In the globalist mind, Farage and Trump aren\u2019t just enemies, they are heretics.  Maybe even, in a   sense, they are  .   So while Farage and Trump have won their respective political victories, the full fury of the elite has yet to be felt.   Next: The Deep State Divebombs Trump.
