Of course, there are many other skills required, but those make the subjects of other articles. \\nFor this week\u2019s Prep Blog Review I\u2019ve gathered five articles with useful tips, most of them simple home remedies, for healthy preppers. \\n1. 10 Home Remedies For Oral Thrush \\n\u201cScientifically referred to as orophangeal Candidiasis, oral thrush is basically a yeast infection that tends to develop on the tongue. It\u2019s unpleasant to look at, and even painful when you have it. The frustrating thing about this condition is that it might be drug-resistant, especially if the Candida rejects anti-fungal medication. \\nBut guess what? I will provide you with top 10 home remedies for oral thrush, all of which are safe and proven to treat the condition.

Whether it\u2019s in the morning or before bed, the extreme tingle of Listerine is a familiar part of our daily routine. \\nBut did you know that Listerine has many other uses besides a mouthwash?

This is due to Listerine\u2019s high alcohol content. \\nListerine may not work as well as dedicated antiseptics, nor be as comfortable to use (alcohol can really sting!), but it definitely works in a pinch to kill bacteria, reduce the chance of infection and speed up the rate of healing.\u201d \\nRead more in Ask A Prepper . \\n3. 4 Natural Steps To Rebuilding Your Gums \\n\u201cIt\u2019s common for people these days to have issues with their gums. Many people have been told that their gums are \u201cwithering away\u201d or thinning, and even have tooth loss as a result. One young woman I spoke with in the past few months was only in her 20s, and yet her dentist told her she would need three implants and would eventually lose all of her teeth. \\nOthers have periodontal disease and can\u2019t seem to make any progress.

The acclimatization of modern people to a lifestyle that is primarily indoors is a recipe for disaster when considering the importance of vitamin D and bone health. \\nThe following will discuss some of the major reasons why you need as much sunlight exposure as you can obtain within reasonable limits and how you can remove the primary obstacles that could be in your way.\u201d \\nRead more on Ready Nutrition . \\n5. 18 Natural Home Remedies For Acne \\n\u201cBefore learning about the home remedies for acne, let us first define what acne is.
