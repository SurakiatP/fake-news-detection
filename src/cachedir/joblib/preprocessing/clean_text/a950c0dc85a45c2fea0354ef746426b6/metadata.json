[Gaffney said things could be different this time, and maybe not in a good way, because \u201cNorth Korea is now in a position to attack with horrific effect the United States itself  \u2014   not just our friends and allies and forces in the region, but the continental mainland of the United States. \u201d  \u201cOne of the ways in which they could do that, we believe, is through unleashing, perhaps via a nuclear device overhead  \u2014   currently there are two North Korean satellites circling the Earth, and passing over the United States with regularity, that could conceivably house an electromagnetic pulse optimized nuclear weapon,\u201d he explained. If detonated, such a weapon could \u201ctake out the United States by destroying our electric grid,\u201d an offensive capability Gaffney described as a \u201c \u201d even before North Korea develops   intercontinental ballistic missiles. \u201cThese are real threats that are now to us, here at home,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that somewhat changes the \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 exercise that we\u2019ve been going through for decades now. \u201d Gaffney quoted Vice President Mike Pence talking about putting an end to \u201cwillful deception,\u201d by which he meant \u201cthe willful deception of the North Koreans as they have entered into a succession of agreements with us, including that they would not get nuclear weapons  \u2014   which of course they predictably violated with impunity. \u201d \u201cIn fact, they were rewarded for doing it, in subsequent negotiations and concessions made to them,\u201d he added.  \u201cBut there\u2019s another kind of willful blindness, or willful deception if you will, that\u2019s operating here. And that is I believe the deception we\u2019ve indulged in, in this country, with respect to China,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cWe\u2019re endlessly told the Chinese are the solution to this problem. If only the Chinese will restrain their clients in North Korea, this problem will be at least mitigated, if not eliminated. \u201d He said the truth of the matter is, \u201cthe record is pretty clear that the Chinese consider bad behavior from North Korea to be a strategic asset for them. \u201d \u201cFar from constraining it, I think they\u2019re enabling it  \u2014   no question about that  \u2014   but I think they actually find it very expedient to use against the United States, notably as just one example in the course of conversations with Donald Trump,\u201d he observed. \u201cWithin days of ending a campaign in which he promised to brand them  \u2014   as they are  \u2014   a currency manipulator, in the interest of inducing the Chinese to behave as intermediaries and constrain North Korea, the president has said \u2018oh, no, no, they\u2019re not a currency manipulator.\u2019 I think that\u2019s the kind of evidence of bennies that flow to the North Koreans, and principally to the Chinese, that enable the North Koreans to keep on keeping on  \u2014   in fact, to become more dangerous with Chinese help. \u201d Marlow turned the conversation to Tuesday\u2019s shooting rampage in Fresno, where suspect Kori Ali Muhammad targeted white victims and reportedly shouted \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d as the police took him down. The Associated Press has been criticized for refusing to print the phrase as Muhammad said it, instead rendering it in English as \u201cGod is great!\u201d Gaffney further argued that this common translation of \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d is incorrect. \u201cIt means \u2018Allah is greatest,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNot God, some Abrahamic faith God, but Allah isn\u2019t just great or even greater, he is greatest. This is the jihadist battle cry. It\u2019s what you are supposed to say when you are killing infidels, to assure that if you\u2019re killed in the process you\u2019ll get credit for it as a shaheed, a martyr, a guy who is sacrificing himself for the greater glory of sharia. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s almost a parody these days that the reflexive response of law enforcement, if it isn\u2019t \u2018nothing to see here folks,\u2019 it certainly is \u2018nothing to see here in the way of sharia supremacism,\u2019\u201d he complained.  \u201cNow, this guy may have a lot of other issues. Apparently he\u2019s homeless, he hated white people  \u2014   I get that. But when he says those words, you cannot ignore the fact that probably somewhere, maybe because of what he\u2019s been hearing on the news, or maybe because of something he\u2019s been hearing in jail, where a lot of guys are getting converted to jihad, or Muslims going in come out   jihadists. Whatever the provenance of it, you cannot ignore the fact that he probably had somewhere in his DNA this belief that it would enhance his standing with Allah, or at least advance Allah\u2019s cause of imposing on everybody  \u2014   Muslim and   alike, by the way  \u2014   this toxic ideology of sharia,\u201d said Gaffney. \u201cI\u2019ve had it, frankly, with these guys in law enforcement who are willfully blind,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWe respect people doing their duties, God knows, but when they incessantly repeat this like it\u2019s some kind of incantation, it\u2019s a disservice to the public, and it suggests malfeasance on their part in terms of protecting us from these kinds of threats. \u201d Marlow next asked Gaffney about reports that the first \u201cDREAMer\u201d  \u2014   a young illegal alien protected under President Obama\u2019s extension of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  \u2014   has been deported under President Trump. Many view the deportation of people brought to the United States as children by their parents to be unfair, since the children had no say in the matter. Gaffney agreed with Marlow\u2019s proposal that DACA provides an incentive for illegal aliens to bring their children across the border, so removing that incentive will help reduce the volume of illegal border crossings. \u201cIt is fundamentally about the rule of law,\u201d Gaffney declared. \u201cThese happen to be particularly sympathetic characters. They didn\u2019t, as you say, have a say in coming here  \u2014   their parents brought them sometimes in utero, but nonetheless brought them here. As a result the Obama administration, and many Democrats, and a lot of Republicans for that matter, were kind of willing to look the other way as President Obama essentially waived the law and created new regulations that would enable them to stay here permanently. \u201d \u201cI hope that this action isn\u2019t one that will be countermanded by President Trump as he learns of it, probably from the news, having in the course of his campaign and I think subsequently said he would try to find a way to accommodate these people,\u201d Gaffney continued. \u201cIt does come down to the magnet, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to turn off. More people being attracted to come to this country  \u2014   and I think to the extent that you can figure the kids at least will get a permanent place here, if you can get them across the border, is a magnet and should be turned off, along with the others. \u201d Marlow sought Gaffney\u2019s take on the special referendum in Turkey that gave President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vastly increased powers, and secured him in office for over a decade to come. \u201cWhat was shocking was that he very narrowly won, which suggests to me that he had to steal a lot of votes in order to get across the   mark,\u201d Gaffney said. He saw Erdogan as \u201cdead set on, and now one very important step closer to achieving, the caliphate that he has had his eyes set on since he was a young mayor in Istanbul. \u201d To that end, Gaffney recalled, Erdogan established an Islamist political party with his old ally Fethullah Gulen, who now lives in   in the United States, and is blamed as the mastermind of all Turkish unrest by Erdogan. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to convert Turkey from a   basically secular,    democratic nation into one that is now increasingly just another dangerous Islamist republic,\u201d he warned. \u201cAnd that I think is going to be bad for the Turks, it\u2019s for sure bad for Europe, and I think will be a real problem going forward, as it has been to an extent for a while now, for the NATO alliance. Because let\u2019s recall they are a member of NATO. They are privy to its secrets. They have access to its technology. \u201d  \u201cThe fact that Erdogan is this president, now dictator effectively, is I fear going to be increasingly moving his country into alliances with the Islamic State, with   with the Muslim Brotherhood, with Russia, with China. It makes this a very serious problem for our security interests and those of the NATO alliance, he said. Gaffney said it was a mistake for President Trump to call Erdogan and \u201ccongratulate him on what is, in fact, a contested election. \u201d He was uncertain who recommended this course of action to Trump, but said \u201cthere are obviously lots of people in his administration who are inclined to think that if we just do more of what Obama did  \u2014   which is try to romance, and accommodate, and even appease these sharia supremacists, and that\u2019s what Erdogan is  \u2014   that they\u2019ll behave better. \u201d \u201cI think that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d he judged. \u201cI wish the president hadn\u2019t made that call. But more to the point, I think we\u2019re going to have to give some very serious thought, there is no institutional arrangement to decoupling a NATO ally from the alliance. We\u2019re going to have to try to figure out how to do that because otherwise, I think we\u2019ve got a potential enemy inside our huddle. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
