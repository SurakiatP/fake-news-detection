As the Buffalo Police Department illustrated last week, this trail often contains the blood of defenseless animals. \\nPolice incompetence coupled with deadly training came to a head last week and wreaked havoc on the residents of Buffalo. The Narcotics Division of the Buffalo Police Department executed a series of drug raids last week leading to a handful of arrests and the seizure of small quantities of drugs \u2014 mostly cannabis. \\nAfter the department released their heroic numbers to the press on how much dangerous cannabis was taken off the streets, they remained conveniently silent about the dogs they slaughtered along the way. \\nOn Friday morning, Buffalo cops, in their search for a 170 lb 5\u201911\u201d black male, raided the home of Michael Urban \u2014 a 5\u201911\u201d 210 lb white male. \\nWhile police were ramming the innocent man\u2019s face into his kitchen floor, Urban pleaded with them not to kill his dog. But it was to no avail. \\nPolice took aim at the helpless dog who, according to Urban was simply standing there in a non-threatening manner. \u2018Boom,\u2019 one officer fired, but the bullet only injured Urban\u2019s 18-month-old pit bull named Gotham, sending him running away frightened and crying. \\nAs the dog is wailing in agony, another officer fires a round directly into the dog\u2019s skull, exploding the innocent animal\u2019s head. But, it gets worse. \\nUrban lives on the second floor of an apartment. When the second officer shot, that bullet went through the floor and almost killed the tenant downstairs. \\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Urban recalls. \u201cAs the bullet hole went through the floor through the ceiling, as the dog\u2019s blood is dripping through the downstairs apartment\u2026 who\u2019s accountable?\u201d \\nAs Gotham\u2019s blood drips from the bullet hole in Urban\u2019s floor and out of the hole of Jami Krafchak\u2019s ceiling in the apartment below, cops decided to go after her too. \\nAfter they nearly killed her, cops raided Krafchak\u2019s home. She was manhandled, searched with no warrant, and humiliated as she stood there in her nightgown. \\nNeither Urban nor Krafchak were charged with a crime. \\nThe night before the heroic cops of the Buffalo Narcotics Division killed an innocent man\u2019s beloved pet, they raided the home of Cory and Cindy Meer. \\nAccording to Meer\u2019s lawyer, Matthew Albert , Meer and his two-year-old son watched helplessly as jackboots murdered their beloved family dog, Damian, a six-year-old Pit Bull. \\nMeer tells Artvoice that his dog was not a threat to officers. \u201cHe is the most family friendly dog I\u2019ve ever had\u2026 he\u2019s never hurt anyone,\u201d said Meer. \u201cHe would have licked the cops.\u201d \\nJust like Urban, Meer lied face down as he begged the cops not to shoot Damian. Again, this was to no avail. \\nAs Meer\u2019s 2-year-old watched in horror, a cop blasted the family dog to death. \\n\u201cMy son lost his best friend right in front of him,\u201d Meer said. \\nAlso like Urban, Meer was not arrested. However, a friend at his house allegedly had a small amount of marijuana on him, so the raid was justified, according to police. \\nAccording to Meer\u2019s attorney, he has 12 active cases of dogs being killed by the same squad. \\n\u201cThey are going to say they are going after dangerous drug dealers,\u201d Albert said. \u201cOut of the cases I have, they\u2019ve hit the wrong houses numerous times , found nothing numerous times, and I think at best, they\u2019ve found a few pills at one of these houses\u2026 charges I got dismissed because they were filed wrong.\u201d \\nIn 2014, the Free Thought Project reported on a Freedom of Information Act request for use of force incidents within the Buffalo police department. The information was shocking. \\nAccording to use of force reports, Buffalo Police shot 92 dogs from Jan. 1, 2011 through Sept. 2014. Seventy-three of those dogs died. Nineteen survived. \\nTo provide a comparison, Buffalo\u2019s numbers more than triple the amount of dog shooting incidents involving police in Cincinnati, a municipality of similar size. \\n\u201cThe numbers are what the numbers are,\u201d Buffalo Police Chief of Detectives Dennis Richards said in an interview with WGRZ in 2014. \u201cCertainly, no officer takes any satisfaction in having to dispatch a dog.\u201d \\nApparently, however, they do. It is not like Buffalo residents have more dogs than other parts of the country. This department seemingly takes satisfaction in killing people\u2019s dogs. \\nWhen asked if the Buffalo police have undergone any special training in regards to dealing with dogs, or the handling of dogs in a non-lethal manner, Chief Richards said, \u201cIt has not come to that point in Buffalo that we\u2019ve implemented any of those other techniques.\u201d \\nApparently killing a dog every other week, or two in a 12-hour period, is just dandy and they see no problem with it or reason to seek out training to deal with such a high rate of puppycide. \\nSomething has to be done, however, and it is far more than just training. The most effective action that would need to be taken would be to drastically reduce the instance of no-knock search warrants. According to an ACLU report, 62 percent of SWAT raids are searches for drugs. \\nIf we want to end puppycide, we have to end the drug war , the two are not mutually exclusive.

WTF are the judges in Buffalo doing handing out no-knock search warrants for refer with the track record of Buffalo narcotics? \\n\u201cno-knock search warrants\u201d<< this is the real crime! \\nThe words \"search warrant\" can\\'t even apply in these cases. It\\'s more like an Execution Warrant. \\nThe only acceptable cause to conduct a raid, especially on a civilian residence, is if there is a Hostage Situation. \\nNo Hostage, No Raid! common sense! \\nSo a bunch of Steroid Junkies have to miss out on playing War Games with civilian lives? Well, too bad! We can call that an acceptable loss. Mike \\nI hope and pray that everyone of these thug cops that shot dogs, get shot themselves and left to bleed out in the gutter like the trash they truly are!!!! Gordon Klock \\nThey clearly get some non-admitted, sense of satisfaction, by killing people\u2019s pets in front of them, & we all are coming to know that there is absolutely no reasoning with these sadistic clowns, \u201cthe war on drugs\u201d has always been a scam to generate prison labor, & terrorize the populace, whilst maintaining the naive illusion that it is all somehow morally responsible behavior to harm & incarcerate people over such an exaggerated \u201cthreat\u201d (more likely to oneself, if at all), & they really seem to enjoy scaring the helpless, as they commit these acts of brutality that would\u2019ve been illegal for them to do three or four decades ago\u2026\u2026 katz ro \\ntried to twitter you a link this is all on video. personally I feel felony charges should be lodged against any lea that comes to someones home and shoots their dog for no reason'"}, "time": 1742561939.624433}
