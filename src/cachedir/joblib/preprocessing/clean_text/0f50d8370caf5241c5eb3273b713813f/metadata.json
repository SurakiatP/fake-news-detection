The email, sent January 2015 before the official launch of Clinton\u2019s campaign, is part of the latest dump of John Podesta emails by the online hacktivist group Wikileaks. The message, authored by campaign manager Robby Mook, is about a planned meeting between Clinton and then-DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz It also describes a meeting between Mook and White House political adviser David Simas. Mook\u2019s message mostly deals with mundane political details, but at the end he makes an interesting comment that suggests an awareness of pro-Clinton bias at the DNC. \\n\u201cI asked [Simas] that he make sure she [DWS] has meetings scheduled with other potential candidates, so they can credibly say they\u2019re meeting with everyone.\u201d \\nThe sentence is brief but carries a clear implication: Mook is urging the DNC to set up meetings for the sole purpose of looking like it isn\u2019t in the tank for Clinton\u2019s campaign. \\nREAD MORE: FOX'S CHRIS WALLACE GRILLS ROBBY MOOK OVER HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN SCANDALS \\nThe emails supplement an ample amount of existing evidence that the DNC overtly favored Clinton during the presidential primary process, despite the fact it is supposed to be politically neutral between different Democratic candidates. For instance, then-deputy DNC Chair Donna Brazile fed primary debate questions to Clinton\u2019s campaign, while leaked DNC emails from the summer showed a great deal of official hostility towards Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign. \\nMook\u2019s comment indicates the Clinton campaign was very aware of the DNC\u2019s bias from the beginning of 2015, and was directly advising Wasserman Schultz on how she could make this bias less obvious.
