Harper Perennial. $15. 99. Florida is a place and a state of mind. As the former, it\u2019s lovely but afflicted, like Fay Wray in the hands of King Kong (developers). As the latter, it leaves much to be desired. I went to high school in southwest Florida. The malcontents pronounced it  . Florida is a supposedly fun place that has a lot of sadness clinging to it, like barnacles to a boat\u2019s hull. The novelist Cynthia Ozick is not someone I can imagine enjoying blender margaritas down at the beach bar, with sand in her toes. Yet Ozick was not far off, in her short story \u201cRosa,\u201d when she wrote: \u201cThe whole peninsula of Florida was weighted down with regret. Everyone had left behind a real life. \u201d One of the themes of \u201cSunshine State,\u201d Sarah Gerard\u2019s striking book of essays, is how Florida can unmoor you and make you reach for shoddy,    solutions to your psychic unease. Gerard grew up in Clearwater, a beach city near Tampa. She writes about how her otherwise incredulous parents (they met in a biker bar he was wearing a   Jimmy Buffett  ) fell into New Thought, a   movement. Almost as bad, they signed on with Amway. That company,   by the    of Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, can, many have argued, resemble a pyramid scheme. Gerard decides that dabbling with Amway was, in her perfect phrase, a form of \u201cachievement tourism. \u201d She writes, \u201cWe left reality for a moment and believed the impossible was possible. \u201d Gerard\u2019s essay collection is one of two new books that examine the Florida experiment. The other is Jack E. Davis\u2019s \u201cGulf: The Making of an American Sea,\u201d a sensitive and sturdy work of environmental history. Obviously, the Gulf of Mexico does not belong solely to Florida. It is the   body of water in the world. It touches several other countries  \u2014   indeed, it is named for one of them  \u2014   as well as other American states. But Davis lives in Florida, and that state\u2019s wet western edges run along a vast amount of the Gulf\u2019 like salt on the rim of a cocktail. He can\u2019t help but dwell often upon his home place. Thanks to books by John Jeremiah Sullivan (\u201cPulphead\u201d) and Leslie Jamison (\u201cThe Empathy Exams\u201d) and a handful of other young writers, the essay collection has new impetus and drama in American letters. The essay has gained ground on the short story. \u201cSunshine State\u201d deserves to be talked about in this company, even if its essays are   . When Gerard is on, she is really on. She\u2019s the author of one previous book, the novel \u201cBinary Star\u201d (2015). The first essay is a knockout, a lurid red heart wrapped in barbed wire. It\u2019s called \u201cBFF,\u201d and it\u2019s about the author\u2019s intense friendship with a girl who grew up to become a stripper and who spent time in shelters for battered women. This essay is about attraction and betrayal, and has the sinister propulsion of a Mary Gaitskill short story. \u201cYou shinier,\u201d Gerard writes about her friend. \u201cYou prettier. You taller. You thinner, more popular. In middle school, you had friends and I had you. \u201d They\u2019d had tattoos on their hips that read, when they stood side by side, \u201cForever    ever. \u201d Their eventual split was devastating. The author had the means to get out of town the friend did not. Gerard catalogs the lies her friend told her, then she lists her own. She writes about her damage, splitting her face open while jumping from a train. This essay draws blood. Many of the essays in \u201cSunshine State\u201d fall somewhere between memoir and journalism. Two of the longer pieces, about work to care for the homeless in Florida and about a troubled bird sanctuary, are serious and impeccably reported. But the author\u2019s voice is lost in the telling. She\u2019s best when her evocations of the frenzy that is Florida are personal. Historians, inspired by Fernand Braudel\u2019s epic 1949   study of the Mediterranean Sea (1949) have written books about most of the world\u2019s important bodies of water. Davis\u2019s \u201cGulf\u201d is the first comprehensive history of the Gulf of Mexico, a place that tends to be, he persuasively argues, \u201cexcluded from the central narrative of the American experience. \u201d Texas and Louisiana also have a great deal of   real estate, and Davis\u2019s book does not skimp on their histories. But since Gerard, Davis and I each grew up staring at the same   water off Florida, I will stick with Florida in this review. Davis carefully relates its history, from the state\u2019s native people and its earliest European explorers, through the early history of the United States and the arrival of tourists, developers and those who would fish and hunt Florida to depletion. The author has a   mind, and frequently views the history of the Gulf through the prism of artists and writers including Winslow Homer, Wallace Stevens, Ernest Hemingway and John D. MacDonald. His prose is supple and clear. About the arrival of motorized shrimp boats on the Gulf, he writes: \u201cThey pushed farther out into the Gulf, the classical music of a   sea passage drowned forever by the heavy metal of internal combustion and snorting exhaust. Fishers discovered that if they worked past sunset, their trawls were filling with a new kind of shrimp, browns, which rose near the surface at night. \u201d Davis\u2019s book functions, as well, as a cri de coeur about the Gulf\u2019s environmental ruin. His book runs up through the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. That event aside, he writes, \u201cEvery day in the Gulf is an environmental disaster, originating from sources near and far, that eclipses the spill. \u201d \u201cGoodbye North, Hello South,\u201d Bessie Smith sang in \u201cFlorida Bound Blues. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so cold up here that the words freeze in your mouth. \u201d The words in Gerard\u2019s and Davis\u2019s books are   and, in their way, optimistic. Both writers make the effort, essential to any form of love, to see their state plain.'"}, "time": 1742564138.4196212}
