He also hailed efforts made so far to make the military \u201cefficient\u2026 modern and highly effective.\u201d \\n\u201cThe number of military drills has increased multiple times, including snap checks, which for some reasons from time to time worry our counterparts, let\u2019s call them as such for now,\" he added. \\nHe added that other countries\\' drills do not worry Russia.
