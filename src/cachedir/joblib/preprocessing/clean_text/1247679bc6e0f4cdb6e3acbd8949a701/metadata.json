Now we are facing the very real possibility of another world war, and in a world with massive nuclear arsenals on both sides I find that to be terrifying\u2026 Continue reading the John Embry interview below\u2026 Advertisement To hear what billionaire Eric Sprott & Rick Rule are doing with their own money and which $7 billion company John Embry & Dr. Marc Faber oversee click on the logo: \\nJohn Embry continues: \u201cIn my mind, that crisis dwarfs the economic and financial deterioration. \\nOn a separate note, I laughed when I saw the U.S. GDP number come in at 2.9 percent. That is totally at odds with important economic indicators such as freight traffic, industrial production, construction, oil consumption, etc. \\nAlong those same lines, the inflation rate published by the government sharply understates the true rate of inflation for the average U.S. citizen.

And those are the primary items that the average consumers spend the bulk of their incomes on in the United States. \\nThe issue of Obamacare has become a national disgrace, with premium increases in 2017 to exceed double-digit percentages in virtually all constituencies. It will be interesting to see how this reality is reflected in voting patterns next week. Despite the mainstream press awarding the election to Hillary Clinton, there may be a bigger backlash coming from the voting public than anticipated. The public has become increasingly disenchanted with the establishment and what it has done to living standards for the average American. \\nHowever, irrespective of who wins the election, I foresee a big upward price move in gold and silver that may have already started today, as there are no palatable solutions to the world\u2019s massive debt problems. I have long believed that we are going to experience a global hyperinflation for the first time in history, and this represents the most disruptive social condition that can possibly occur. Eventually the debt will have to be dealt with but I suspect that will happen in the wake of the hyperinflation. At that moment the only refuges will be hard assets, with gold and silver at the front of the pack. Meaning, today\u2019s upside move in gold and silver is nothing compared to what is coming.\u201d \\n***KWN has now released the remarkable audio interview with Nomi Prins CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \\n***ALSO RELEASED: This Key Signal Will Indicate Liftoff For Gold & Silver And The Mining Stocks CLICK HERE. \\n***KWN has also released Rick Rule\u2019s timely audio interview CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \\n\u00a9 2015 by King World News\u00ae.
