In the tape Hillary is clearly heard telling the Jewish Press journalists present: I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. \\nListen for yourselves: \\nPresent at the meeting was Jewish Press editor Eli Chomsky, who recalls being shocked that \u201canyone could support the idea\u2014offered by a national political leader, no less\u2014that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.\u201dHillary Clinton\\'s stated practice of taking a private position and a public position on every issue is also apparent in her comments in that same meeting on whether it was worth talking to the Syrian government. Said Clinton at the time (sounding almost like Ron Paul): You know, I\u2019m pretty much of the mind that I don\u2019t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you\u2019re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them. ...But if you say, \u2018they\u2019re evil, we\u2019re good, [and] we\u2019re never dealing with them,\u2019 I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them\u2026 \\nPerhaps Hillary should come clean on how many elections she \"determined who was going to win\" beforehand while Secretary of State.'"}, "time": 1742563506.0421262}
