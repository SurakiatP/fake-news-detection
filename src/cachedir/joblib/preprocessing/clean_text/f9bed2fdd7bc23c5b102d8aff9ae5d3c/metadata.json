Schweizer said, \u201cIn 2011, John Podesta joins the board of this very small energy company called Joule Energy based out of Massachusetts. About two months after he joins the board of a Russian entity called Rusnano, puts a billion rubles which is about    into John Podesta\u2019s company. Now, what is Rusnano? It\u2019s not a private company, Steve. It is a fund directly funded by the Kremlin. In fact, the Russian science minister called Rusnano, Putin\u2019s child. So you have the Russian government investing in one John Podesta\u2019s businesses in 2011, while he is an advisor to Hillary Clinton at the State Department. \u201d He continued, \u201cSo then in 2013, he goes to the White House, to be a special counselor to Barack Obama, and that requires that you, you know, have financial disclosures every year. In his financial disclosure form in 2013, he not only fails to disclose these 75, 000 shares of stock that he has in Joule Energy which is funded in part by the Russian government. He also fails to disclose that he is on one of the three corporate board that this entity has. It\u2019s got this very complex ownership structure. He discloses he is on the company in Massachusetts, that is he on the board of a company in the Netherlands, but he fails to disclose that he is also on the executive order of the holding company. That\u2019s a clear violation of the disclosure rules that needs to be looked at. \u201d He added, \u201cWhat makes the Podesta case clear is there was a transfer of money and there was a transfer of a lot of money that stood to make John Podesta a lot of money. That is unique and that\u2019s extremely troubling because at the time that transfer is taking place he is advising Hillary Clinton at the State Department. We know that from the Podesta emails that he is helping her make personnel decisions, speech decisions, policy decisions. He is meeting with her monthly. It\u2019s a transfer of money from a foreign government, at the time, that is he was advising America\u2019s chief diplomat, Hillary Clinton. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628334.6681502}
