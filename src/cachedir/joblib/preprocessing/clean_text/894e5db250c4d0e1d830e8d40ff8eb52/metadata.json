The misogynists on the Right have questioned her health, her stamina, and everything in between. That is, of course, code for \u201cthe little woman doesn\u2019t belong in the Oval Office.\u201d However, one Texas Republican has taken the misogyny to a whole other level. \\nMeet Sid Miller, the Agriculture Commissioner for the state of Texas. He is also a former lawmaker. Miller, like most Republicans, doesn\u2019t make his hatred for Hillary Clinton any secret. Instead, he somehow thought that it was perfectly appropriate to take to Twitter and express his feelings in a most disgusting way while tweeting about the polls. Miller\u2019s tweet reads: \\n\u201cTRUMP 44 Cunt 43,\u201d punctuated with a cheering \u201cGo Trump Go!\u201d \\nIn the predictable firestorm after, Miller tried to make the public believe that his account was hacked. Miller\u2019s staff hastily relesed this defense of his post: \\n\u201cThe campaign was retweeting information today and inadvertently retweeted a tweet that they were not aware contained a derogatory term. The tweet was taken down as soon as possible. Commissioner Miller finds the term vulgar and offensive and apologizes to anyone who may have seen it.\u201d \\nThere\u2019s a problem with that, though: The tweet was not a retweet. It was simply a tweet. Therefore, either Sid Miller himself or someone on his staff wrote this: \\nNaturally, Miller is Donald Trump\u2019s number one man in Texas, according to the Texas Tribune . No surprise there. Further, Miller is no stranger to making tasteless and offensive jokes with regards to Hillary. Here is one that is just a few hours old as of this writing: \\nThat tweet written in reference to the fact that the reason Hillary\u2019s emails are in the news again is because of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting scandals. \\nSo, in other words, this Sid Miller character is the perfect Donald Trump supporter \u2013 a misogynistic and deeply ignorant asshat who can\u2019t stand the idea of losing to a woman. \\nFeatured image via screen capture from The Daily Beast Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742563809.456933}
