[VICE News reports that the aptly named \u201cChinese Encyclopedia\u201d will launch online in 2018 with the help of thousands of scholars from research institutes and universities who have been employed by the government to contribute articles relating to over 100 topics to the new website. The expected finished product will feature as many as 300, 000 article entries.  Yang Muzhi, the    of the project and the chairman of the Book and Periodicals Distribution Association of China, said in an interview, \u201cThe Chinese Encyclopaedia is not a book, but a Great Wall of culture. \u201d He added that China was under pressure from the international community to develop an encyclopedia that will \u201cguide and lead the public and society. \u201d The development of the Chinese Encyclopedia may in part be due to the blocking of Wikipedia by the Chinese government. Chinese tech companies Baidu and Qihoo 360 operate their own alternative online encyclopedias but fail to match the size and content level of Wikipedia. Muzhi did, however, claim that this was not a Wikipedia clone. \u201cWe have the biggest, most   author team in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is not to catch up, but overtake. \u201d How much control the Chinese government will have over the content published in the online encyclopedia is unknown.
