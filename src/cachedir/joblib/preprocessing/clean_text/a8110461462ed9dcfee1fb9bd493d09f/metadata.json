I was never asked beforehand to show my wardrobe.\u201d Streeter (left) and the 76ers home court at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia \\n\u201cI also felt it was important to express the ongoing challenges and ongoing injustice we face as a black community within the United States of America \u2014 that\u2019s very important to me,\u201d Streeter said. \u201cYes, we live in the greatest country in the world but there are issues that we cannot ignore.

In this case, I believe Streeter honestly wanted to make a point, not sing the national anthem, which is the matter of contention here. \\nThe national anthem is sung to honor the heroes who have served (and died) for our country before major events. It isn\u2019t time to make a point or \u201chave a discussion\u201d (a discussion, may I add, that usually takes the form of a monologue from whatever social justice warrior is giving it \u2014 who usually acts surprised and disappointed when people have a real discussion and push back against their disrespect of the flag). \\nIf you\u2019re singing the national anthem, it isn\u2019t about your opinions. It isn\u2019t about your talent. It isn\u2019t about what you\u2019ve done. Advertisement - story continues below'"}, "time": 1742562284.229953}
