It was the typical misery of summer airline travel  \u2014   or so it seemed. A short distance way away, in another terminal, something more unpredictable than the weather had begun to sweep across the New York airport: Panic. It spread quickly and without warning. By the time Sunday night was over, Ms. Rosen, 32, had sprawled out under a table seeking cover, followed a crowd of people who bolted through a secure door onto the tarmac, frantically called her sister to find out what was happening and tell her that she was alive, and, finally, made a mad dash from the terminal to join mobs of travelers who thought they might be living through an episode of terror. In the end, it proved to be a false alarm. While the authorities were still trying to piece together exactly how a report of gunfire at 9:34 p. m. outside the security checkpoint at Terminal 8 led to complete turmoil across one of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, the accounts of passengers in interviews and on social media offered a lesson in the anatomy of fear. It was a night of confusion and dread, informed by the latest headlines  \u2014   including reports of recent attacks on airports in Brussels and Istanbul  \u2014   as much as fact. In the absence of official information or instructions, unconfirmed reports from social media fueled the hysteria. Officials said there was no evidence that what took place at Kennedy Airport was the result of a hoax. It was, rather, a sign of the times. \u201cRight now, what is being concentrated on is the investigation into what the catalyst of the incident is,\u201d said Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport. Joe Haviland was at Terminal 8 seeing off his family when the first wave of panic hit. People nearby had been gathered watching the Olympics, as Usain Bolt of Jamaica made his bid for a third gold medal in the   dash. \u201cWe heard a big celebration,\u201d Mr. Haviland told Fox News shortly after being evacuated. He described hearing something like a loud pop, followed by the sight of a herd of people running his direction. \u201cWhen you see 80 people come running around the corner,\u201d he said, \u201cand they break a door to get out, you think \u2018Oh my God, what is happening? \u2019\u201d He said he saw \u201cpeople working for the airline taking off their shirts,\u201d and saying, \u201cThis is not worth it, I am leaving. \u201d Within minutes, he said, police officers with their guns drawn were shouting, \u201cShow me your hands!\u201d The bomb squad soon arrived, and the area was evacuated. But inside Terminal 8, by the departure gates, many passengers had no idea anything was wrong. Judy Rothman Rof\u00e9, who had been visiting her son in Brooklyn and was waiting for an American Airlines flight back to Los Angeles, was waiting by Gate 33. Around 10 p. m. a passenger nearby was checking the internet and told her it seemed their flight was not delayed because of the weather. \u201cThere is a shooter at large,\u201d she was told. Still, she said, as the news filtered out, people around her were relatively calm. \u201cIt was business as usual in our section of the terminal,\u201d she said. Until it wasn\u2019t. Shortly after 11, she said, \u201cwe heard screaming. \u201d It was unclear what set off the wave of panic, but suddenly the eerie calm turned to chaos. \u201cLots of screaming, crying, mass hysteria,\u201d she said. The gate agents, she said, were nowhere to be found passengers threw themselves under counters and huddled under chairs. After several minutes, an announcement came over the public address system, ordering passengers to leave their bags, put their hands above their heads and evacuate. As she left, she said, scores of law enforcement officers, weapons drawn, were heading into the terminal. Around the same time, Terminal 1 was also officially evacuated, sending hundreds of people into the street outside the airport, unsure what was happening. The Port Authority said that those were the only two terminals evacuated, but that the panic spread quickly to the rest of the airport. In Terminal 2, where Ms. Rosen was waiting for her San   Delta Air Lines flight, everything seemed normal nearly an hour after the first calls to 911 about a possible gunman. It was around 10:30 p. m. when someone screamed, \u201cShots!\u201d \u201cEveryone started screaming and yelling,\u201d Ms. Rosen said. \u201cI dove under this desk space like everyone else. \u201cThen this guy came running over,\u201d she added. He was not an airport employee or an official, but he had an urgent warning. She recalled that he shouted: \u201cThey\u2019re coming! Let\u2019s go this way!\u201d Not knowing who \u201cthey\u201d might be and not wanting to find out, Ms. Rosen and about a dozen others followed the man through a secure door and onto the tarmac, leaving their belongings behind. \u201cThere were no announcements, nothing,\u201d she said. All she could hear was an   alarm. She waited with about 20 others on the hot, humid tarmac. \u201cI called my sister, freaking out,\u201d she said. \u201cI told her I am on the tarmac, people are saying there are gunshots. I think I am safe. If you see news about this, I am O. K. \u201d The crowd was searching Google and social media when a man  \u2014   she thought he was a pilot  \u2014   finally said they should return. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go back inside,\u2019\u201d she said. Still, when the man opened the door, they found things just as chaotic as when they left. A flood of people were running in a single direction, she said. Out of the terminal. Once again she followed the crowd. There were \u201cjust mobs of people,\u201d she said. She spotted a man in a Transportation Security Administration shirt and asked him what was happening. \u201cYou probably have a better idea than I do\u201d was his response, she said. Finally, a little after midnight early on Monday, employees were allowed back inside the airport. Passengers were permitted to collect their belongings. It would take time for operations to fully resume. And thousands of passengers still needed to figure out what to do next. There were no trains running. The Van Wyck Expressway leading to the airport was closed. Cabs were just starting to trickle back. Eventually, Ms. Rosen climbed in a cab with several others and made her way to her twin sister\u2019s apartment in the city. As she prepared to set off for the airport again on Monday morning, she was a bit more leery about the procedures that might be in place in the event of an actual emergency. \u201cI understand situations like this are inherently chaotic, but the lack of communication and guidance just compounded an already tumultuous and traumatic experience,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least in our terminal, they should have had enough time to get a coordinated plan together. But they didn\u2019t, and that caused a lot of unnecessary panic and heartache. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562716.8173187}
