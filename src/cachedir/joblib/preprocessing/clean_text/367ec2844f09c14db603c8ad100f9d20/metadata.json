Elizabeth Warren ( ) stood on an empty New York stage, reading excerpts from her latest book, This Fight is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class, and could hardly restrain her excitement while reading what sounded like a warning for President Donald Trump: \u201cDonald, you ain\u2019t seen nasty yet. \u201d[Warren was reportedly reading some of her favorite   signs from the   Women\u2019s March in Boston, Massachusetts, when she said, \u201cAnd only one more because I have to discipline myself on this. This is a good sign: \u2018Donald, you ain\u2019t seen nasty yet. \u2019\u201d   Warren was speaking at The Town Hall, a New York   performance space Friday evening. Those who chose to watch Warren read portions from her book and answer questions, instead of attending a rendition of Julius Caesar in which President Trump is killed off, could have paid $ $50 per ticket to do so. Another one of her favorite signs was reportedly, \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are not up for grabs. \u201d In a video, she can be seen saying, \u201cWhat Donald Trump and the Republican majority in the House and the Senate want to do to us, is they want to deliver the knockout blow to the middle class. \u201d Trump\u2019s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  \u2014   a longtime donor to the Democratic Party  \u2014   has stated that Trump\u2019s tax plan is meant to help the middle class and strengthen free market competition. The   senator and former Harvard law professor went on to say, \u201cThe character of a nation is not the character of its president. The character of a nation is the character of its people. \u201d Warren read a paragraph from her book that documented her emotion from the Women\u2019s March in the state she represents. \u201cAs I marched in Boston with tens of thousands of others that day, I had no illusions. I knew it would be a hard fight. I knew there would be dark moments. But I knew that we had tens of millions of people with us, and this fight would be our fight. \u201d Warren, who has said she won\u2019t run for president in 2020, recently said she hopes Republicans would \u201cleave their bodies to science\u201d because she \u201cwould like to cut them open. \u201d During a 2010 debate about proposals about how to fix the financial system, Warren said if a bill for \u201ca stronger consumer agency\u201d was not a possibility, she would choose \u201cno agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor. \u201d One year later, in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, Warren said, \u201cAnd I have thrown rocks at people that I think are in the wrong. \u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019ve done it before, I\u2019ve continued to do it, and I\u2019m going to do it in the future. \u201d Adelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.
