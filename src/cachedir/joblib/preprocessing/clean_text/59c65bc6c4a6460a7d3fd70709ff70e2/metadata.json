John McCain ( ) has reportedly told a   newspaper that he believes \u201cAmerican leadership\u201d was better under President Barack Obama than President Trump  \u2014   the latest in a series of shots the failed 2008 presidential candidate has taken at his fellow Republican. [According to the Guardian, McCain was \u201cvisibly irked\u201d when asked about comments Trump made last week in the wake of the terrorist attack in London, in which he criticized London Mayor Sadiq Khan for his response to the atrocity.  \u201cWhat do you think the message is? The message is that America doesn\u2019t want to lead,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThey are not sure of American leadership, whether it be in Siberia or whether it be in Antarctica. \u201d Then, when asked if America\u2019s international standing was better under Obama, McCain reportedly responded: \u201cAs far as American leadership is concerned, yes. \u201d McCain  \u2014   who lost his 2008 presidential bid against   Obama after a campaign in which he repeatedly defended Obama from his supporters\u2019 criticisms  \u2014   has been an outspoken critic of Trump and has refused to tone it down since his fellow Republican took the White House. In a recent tour of Australia, McCain told an audience in Sydney that Trump has \u201cunsettled\u201d allies and Americans alike. \u201cOther American allies have similar doubts these days and this is understandable,\u201d McCain said, according to The Associated Press at the city\u2019s university. \u201cI realize that some of President Trump\u2019s actions and statements have unsettled America\u2019s friends. They have unsettled many Americans as well. \u201d He went on to urge the Australians to \u201ckeep at\u201d the   Partnership deal in the hope that one day \u201cAmerica will decide to join you. \u201d He also said in an interview with an Australian TV network that Trump makes him \u201cnervous from time to time\u201d and said he was bothered that Trump does not always take the advice of his national security team. \u201cCan I tell you that he does all the time? No. Does it bother me? Yes, it bothers me,\u201d he said. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York. Follow Adam on Twitter: @AdamShawNY.'"}, "time": 1742563259.4030075}
