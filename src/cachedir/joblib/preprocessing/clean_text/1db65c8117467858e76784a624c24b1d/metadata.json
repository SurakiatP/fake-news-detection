She tells us she\u2019s sorry, but she\u2019s not. Because her feelings about this campaign are more important. Read how she describes her situation: \\nI committed a crime this month, along with two of my friends. I\u2019m not the lawbreaking type. In fact, as a 52-year-old mom, my life is pretty predictable and boring. But this election, a particular candidate\u2019s boasts about women pushed me over the edge. \\nIn the suburban, upper-middle-class part of Maine where I live, Republicans and Democrats live together mostly in harmony. In every election cycle, there\u2019s some tension. But the 2016 presidential campaign has been different. Tensions in my town are running at a fevered pitch. \\nWhich is how three middle-aged moms came to be running down the road, tearing up the Donald Trump signs along our version of Main Street. We\u2019d been talking about the infamous Billy Bush tape and the women who have since come forward to share their own stories of abuse. We were angry. Getting Trump\u2019s name off our median strip seemed like the best way to express our rage. \\nThese three women must have been proud of themselves, probably laughing heartily as they committed theft, trespassing and violated the First Amendment of their neighbors. Why? Because she thinks she was assaulted by the signs. \\nIn retrospect, I realize I shouldn\u2019t be proud of my transgression. Hanging out with a bunch of moms, we started grousing about the proliferation of signs. Can you believe someone would put that many Trump signs so close together on our roads? It\u2019s so rude. Who is this jerk? We felt assaulted by the number of signs . The idea of \u201ccleansing\u201d our streets seemed like the fastest way to restore balance and alleviate our election stress \u2014 at least, that night it did. \\n\u201c Assaulted\u201d ? This is exactly why the Left is so dangerous. They are \u201cassaulted\u201d by ideas \u2013 by mere thoughts or opinions that are not their own. They will do anything- and Ms. Stothart did \u2013 to silence any dissent. \\nAnd she writes that \u201c in retrospect, I realize I shouldn\u2019t be proud of my transgression. \u201d \\nShe doesn\u2019t say she isn\u2019t proud, she merely tells us that in retrospect she shouldn\u2019t be proud. \\nWhich tells us that she is . She is proud of what she did. \\nWhen asked what she would say to the victims of her trespassing and theft, she offers no apology, merely a justification that Trump is bad, and that because she herself was a victim of an unwanted sexual advance, it justifies her behavior. \\nShe claims she\u2019ll go to court in December with some sense of humility and shame \u2013 she\u2019ll \u201cexplain\u201d and \u201capologize.\u201d \\nBut she\u2019s not sorry. Not really. \\nTo her \u2013 and the millions of Leftists like her \u2013 the ends justify the means. Silence dissent, crush the opposition, tear down and destroy any thing that strays from your worldview. \\nThis is the world that Ms. Stothart lives in. She still lives in it today. She takes pride in suppressing the political view of her fellow Americans. \\nShe writes that the \u201cagitation and fear is rising on both sides.\u201d \\nNo, Ms. Stothart. I have yet to see a single story about a Trump supporter violating the Constitutional rights of a Hillary Clinton supporter by stealing yard signs. \\nThis is liberal America. This is Ms. Stothart\u2019s America. \\nThis is not the America I want to live in.'"}, "time": 1742628360.9107525}
