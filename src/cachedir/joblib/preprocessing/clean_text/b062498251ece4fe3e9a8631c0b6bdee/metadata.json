But the bogus claims just keep coming. Germans are fleeing their country, fearful of Muslim refugees. The Swedish government supports the Islamic State. The European Union has drafted rules to regulate the ethnicity of snowmen. In their   office overlooking a major thoroughfare in Brussels, an   team known as East Stratcom, serves as Europe\u2019s front line against this onslaught of fake news. Created by the European Union to address \u201cRussia\u2019s ongoing disinformation campaigns,\u201d the team  \u2014   composed of diplomats, bureaucrats and former journalists  \u2014   tracks down reports to determine whether they are fake. Then, it debunks the stories for hapless readers. In the 16 months since the team has been on the job, it has discredited 2, 500 stories, many with links to Russia. In a year when the French, Germans and Dutch will elect leaders, the European authorities are scrambling to counter a rising tide of fake news and   Union propaganda aimed at destabilizing people\u2019s trust in institutions. As officials play   in the fight against sophisticated hacking and fake news operations, they fear Europe and its elections remain vulnerable at a critical moment: The region\u2019s   project of unity hangs in the balance, challenged by populist forces within the bloc and pressures from Russia and beyond. \u201cIf you look at how European media, and even big American media, are covering the issue now, I would say that it is those few people on that team who have been able to raise awareness,\u201d said Jakub Janda, a deputy director with European Values, a think tank based in Prague, who has worked with East Stratcom. Many false claims target politicians who present the biggest obstacles to Moscow\u2019s goal of undermining the European Union. Others seek to portray refugees from the Middle East as terrorists or rapists, fomenting populist anger. In France, the head of the En Marche! party said last week that Russian news channels had targeted the presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, who belongs to the party and is running on a   Union platform. Richard Ferrand, the party\u2019s   said the campaign\u2019s databases and websites had been hit by \u201chundreds, if not thousands,\u201d of attacks from inside Russia. The East Stratcom team is the first to admit that it is outgunned: The task is overwhelming, the volume of reports immense, the support to combat them scant. The team tries to debunk bogus items in real time on Facebook and Twitter and publishes daily reports and a weekly newsletter on fake stories to its more than 12, 000 followers on social media. But its list of 2, 500 fake reports is small compared with the daily churn across social media. Catching every fake news story would be nearly impossible, and the fake reports the team does combat routinely get a lot more viewers than its   efforts. East Stratcom is purely a communications exercise. Still, team members, most of whom speak Russian, have received death threats, and a Czech member of the team has twice been accused on Russian television of espionage. The team in Brussels is not the only force in Europe fighting the problem. Similar groups are being created from Finland to the Czech Republic to disprove online hoaxes, state agencies are improving online security to counter potential hacking attacks and European news media outlets are expanding   teams to counter false reports. One of the biggest problems policy makers across Europe say they face is a lack of tech specialists. Germany recently passed a cybersecurity law that called for a rapid response team to combat hacking attacks. Officials quietly acknowledged, though, that they would need three teams, if they could only find people to staff them. \u201cThere are concerns shared by many governments that fake news could become weaponized,\u201d said Damian Collins, a British politician in charge of a new parliamentary investigation examining the phenomenon. \u201cThe spread of this type of material could eventually undermine our democratic institutions. \u201d Despite the regionwide push to counter false reports, experts question whether such   efforts by governments and publishers will have a meaningful effect. Fake reports can easily be shared through social media with few, if any, checks for accuracy. \u201cMost people just don\u2019t care about where their news comes from,\u201d said Mark Deuze, a professor at the University of Amsterdam. He added that \u201cnep news,\u201d Dutch for \u201cfake news,\u201d has been growing ahead of the country\u2019s national elections next month. \u201cPeople are exposed to a ridiculous amount of information online. \u201d Officials are also anxious about hackers\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the email accounts of candidates and politicians to steal compromising information. Much like their American counterparts, security experts warn, European politicians remain highly vulnerable, though national intelligence agencies are now strengthening lawmakers\u2019 security protocols. In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing tough competition ahead of elections in September, the country\u2019s domestic intelligence service already has reported a sharp rise in   phishing attacks in recent months aimed at political parties and members of the country\u2019s Parliament. They attribute these efforts to the hacking group known as Fancy Bear, or APT 28, which American intelligence agencies linked to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee before the presidential election. Both American and German intelligence officials believe the group is operated by the G. R. U. the Russian military intelligence service. The German government is weighing potential hefty fines for tech giants like Google and Facebook, whose platforms allow false stories to be quickly circulated. The companies insist that they cannot be held responsible because they do not generate the stories.   Maassen, the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service, said that although there was no \u201csmoking gun,\u201d Russia was likely to be involved in the increase in online misinformation aimed at destabilizing German politics. \u201cWhat makes cyberattacks so sexy for foreign powers is that it is nearly impossible to find a smoking gun,\u201d Mr. Maassen said in an interview with Phoenix TV Feb. 12. \u201cIt is always possible to cover your tracks and operate undercover. \u201d American tech giants also have stepped in after they were accused of not doing enough to counter false reports on their platforms, accusations that Facebook, Google and other companies deny. They are now funding initiatives in the United States, France and elsewhere to flag fake news online and remove posts if they are found to violate companies\u2019 terms of use or local laws. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about debunking falsehoods,\u201d said Jenni Sargent, the managing director of First Draft News, a nonprofit that is partly funded by Google and expanding rapidly in France ahead of the country\u2019s elections, as well as across Europe and beyond. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to deal with the content as opposed to the source. \u201d Such efforts across Europe have gained momentum since the United States\u2019 presidential election. Soon after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in November, David Alandete gathered his team in the El Pa\u00eds newsroom in downtown Madrid with one goal in mind: to respond to fake news. Like many journalists, Mr. Alandete, the Spanish newspaper\u2019s managing editor and a former United States correspondent, had seen waves of false reports during the presidential campaign, many directed at Mexico  \u2014   a country that accounts for roughly half of El Pa\u00eds\u2019 online readership. \u201cTrump winning was a major turning point for us,\u201d Mr. Alandete said. \u201cMany of our readers were asking whether they could even travel to the States. \u201d Populist parties and distrust of traditional news media outlets have been growing in Spain, like other   European countries. Such movements have spurred an explosion of fake or misleading news, aimed at either promoting certain political views or undermining others\u2019 credibility. To counter such reports  \u2014   and, in part, to cater to its Mexican readers  \u2014   El Pa\u00eds began expanding its   efforts late last year. That includes assigning five more reporters to debunk false reports online and starting a blog, called \u201cHechos,\u201d or \u201cfacts\u201d in Spanish, to dispel the worst offenders. Not all of El Pa\u00eds\u2019s   targets, though, have been about politics. In its first blog post, published last month, the newspaper\u2019s reporters reviewed false claims that the Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo had abandoned his sports car after hurting one of his hands while driving. The post, according to Mr. Alandete, was viewed more than 200, 000 times  \u2014   making it one of El Pa\u00eds\u2019s   online articles that week. \u201cMany people don\u2019t trust institutions anymore,\u201d Mr. Alandete said. \u201cWe see fake news coming from everywhere. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628416.7525978}
