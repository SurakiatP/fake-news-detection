One of Mr. Koons\u2019s largest sculptures  \u2014   34 feet high, 27 feet wide and 33 feet deep  \u2014   \u201cBouquet of Tulips\u201d is meant to echo the hand of the Statue of Liberty, a gift to the United States from France. Currently under construction in Germany, the work, made of bronze, stainless steel and aluminum, will be permanently installed next year in the plaza in front of the Museum of Modern Art and the Palais de Tokyo. \u201cI hope the work is   to people,\u201d Mr. Koons said in an interview here on Monday. \u201cI hope that the \u2018Bouquet of Tulips\u2019 can communicate a sense of future, of optimism, the joy of offering, to find something greater outside the self. \u201d Inspired by floral paintings by Fragonard, Picasso and others, he said that he had chosen the tulips for their \u201cbuoyancy,\u201d which he hoped would inspire the families of victims of the attacks to carry on. Jane D. Hartley, the United States ambassador to France and Monaco, said she had been thinking of a cultural offering the United States could give France \u201cin a spirit of \u2018we\u2019re in this together\u2019\u201d after terrorist attacks last year: ones at the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper and a kosher supermarket, and then the Nov. 13 attacks that killed 130 people. \u201cMy hope is this amazing sculpture will bring visitors to Paris,\u201d Ms. Hartley said at a news conference on Monday announcing the donation. Tourism in Paris has declined dramatically since the attacks. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, told attendees at the news conference that the sculpture delivered an optimistic message in turbulent times. \u201cWe need to tell the youth and the young generation that it\u2019s not true that tomorrow\u2019s world will be worse than it is today,\u201d she said. Ms. Hartley approached Mr. Koons after discussing the idea at a dinner in Paris in January with her friend Jerry I. Speyer, chairman of the board of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and a collector of the artist\u2019s work. \u201cI know how much he loves France, and he\u2019s the most prominent American living artist,\u201d Ms. Hartley said in an interview before the news conference. Mr. Koons, best known for his metallic sculptures of balloon animals and other souvenir and everyday objects, is also one of the most polarizing and   figures in the contemporary art world. His works have sold for hundreds of millions of dollars, but he waived payment for the sculpture. The 3. 5 million euros ($3. 8 million) it will cost to produce and install the work are being raised from private donations by a nonprofit foundation, Fonds Pour Paris, and its counterpart in the United States, the Paris Foundation. This is the first commemorative work Mr. Koons, who lives in New York, has created, but he does have a festive work, \u201cBalloon Flower (Red),\u201d on display outside 7 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Koons\u2019s work has proved controversial in France. When some of it was displayed at Versailles in 2008, part of a program showing contemporary art at that historic site, French art critics questioned \u201cthe intrusion within the walls of the chateau of 16 giant glittering sculptures by an artist considered a paragon of kitsch,\u201d Le Monde reported at the time. Six years later, in a review of Mr. Koons\u2019s work at the Pompidou Center in Paris, Le Figaro asked in a headline whether he was an \u201cimpostor or a creator?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562454.0811906}
