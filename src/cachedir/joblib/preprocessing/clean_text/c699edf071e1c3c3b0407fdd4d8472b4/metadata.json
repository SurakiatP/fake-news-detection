Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was previously financially aided by the George   MoveOn. org to win his Congressional seat. [Schiff was also awarded the Toll Fellowship, which is sponsored by the Council of State Governments, a nonprofit that monitors federal government activities and is heavily financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations.  The Open Society and   groups have additionally supported a number of Schiff\u2019s legislative efforts. Schiff has been helping to lead the Democrats\u2019 unsubstantiated charges of alleged collusion between President Donald Trump and Moscow. Last month, Schiff delivered the opening statements at a Congressional hearing where he laid out the case for alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  This reporter previously documented serious problems with Schiff\u2019s charges, which include wild conspiracy theories and heavy reliance on a questionable source. In largely forgotten history, Schiff\u2019s 2000 Congressional campaign against Republican incumbent Jim Rogan was openly aided by MoveOn. org. On January 1, 2000, the Wall Street Journal reported on the radical group\u2019s fundraising efforts for Schiff.  The Congressional seat was particularly important since Rogan had gained fame after he was selected to be one of thirteen House Managers in the 1998 impeachment case of Bill Clinton. Rogan was supportive of Clinton\u2019s impeachment and became a hero in the Republican Party. The Journal reported: If MoveOn were to achieve its ambitious goals, it just might have a big impact on this year\u2019s struggle to control Congress, especially the House. Republicans hold only a slim   majority there, and the outcome will \u201clikely be determined in no more than three dozen congressional districts,\u201d says Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. And of course, most congressional impeachment proponents were Republicans. One of the most prominent among them, House impeachment manager James Rogan of California, faces a challenge this year from Democratic State Senator Adam Schiff, for whom MoveOn to date has raised $106, 000, Mr. Boyd says. CNN reported on the MoveOn. org money for Schiff\u2019s 2000 campaign: \u201cBy 2000, MoveOn. org was raising $2 million for Democratic candidates, including more than $100, 000 to help California\u2019s Adam Schiff beat Congressman James Rogan, one of the House managers during Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial. \u201d MoveOn. org also sponsored a January 2010 rally in favor of health care reform outside Schiff\u2019s office in Pasadena, California. Schiff\u2019s 2000 campaign bio, meanwhile, relates that he was \u201cawarded the prestigious Toll Fellowship, sponsored by The Council of State Governments. \u201d The bio continues: Nominated and endorsed by his peers in the Legislature, Schiff was selected from many outstanding applicants across the nation by a committee of state elected and appointed officials as one of the most promising new leaders of state government. In 1998, the California League of High Schools named Schiff Legislator of the Year. Schiff later said that the Toll Fellowship \u201chelped me identify my own leadership strengths, work more effectively with my colleagues and strengthen my relationship with the media. \u201d The Council of State Governments, which sponsors the Toll Fellowship, is heavily financed by Soros.   The Open Society provided the group with $320, 000 in 2003 $1 million in 2004 and another $100, 000 that year alone. In 2009, Schiff introduced the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act. The bill was described by the Justice Center at the   Council of State Governments  \u2014   which gave Schiff the Toll Fellowship award  \u2014   as providing \u201cgrants to state and local governments to design and advance     strategies to reduce corrections spending and increase public safety. \u201d A press release from the Council of State Governments said that Schiff\u2019s bill \u201cbuilds on the justice reinvestment work done by the Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center in Texas, Kansas, Vermont, Rhode Island and seven other states. \u201d The Justice Center\u2019s justice reinvestment initiative was itself directly supported by Soros\u2019s Open Society, the press release documents. In 2014, the Open Society released a statement publicly supporting legislation by Schiff \u201crequiring the president to provide an annual public report on the total number of persons killed or injured in drone strikes. \u201d  The Open Society further signed a joint statement with other leftwing groups, including organizations financed by Soros, supporting Schiff\u2019s Targeted Lethal Force Transparency Act.
