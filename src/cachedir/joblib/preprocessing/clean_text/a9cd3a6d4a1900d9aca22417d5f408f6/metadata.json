With just months left in his term, Mr. Obama\u2019s first comments on the matter, in Europe last week, may have finally cleared up the truth of a tale that has persisted for more than seven years. For conservatives in both America and Britain, the disappearance of the bust from its place of honor soon after the end of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency was  evidence of a liberal snub by Mr. Obama. In their view, he clearly did not fully appreciate the greatness of the British prime minister, who served during and after World War II. (The bust was replaced, White House officials said at the time, with one of Abraham Lincoln.) The conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, the onetime Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a current Republican presidential candidate, are among those who have chastised Mr. Obama over the years for returning the bust to the British. Less than a month after Mr. Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009, a British newspaper bluntly accused him of sending \u201cSir Winston Churchill packing. \u201d Not true, the White House insisted at the time, offering various explanations. William Allman, the White House curator, said in a 2010 interview with CBS News that the bust, on loan to Mr. Bush by Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, \u201cwas already scheduled to go back\u201d before Mr. Obama took office. The bust was returned \u201cas a matter of course\u201d by the new administration along with other art that had been on loan to Mr. Bush for display during his term in office, White House officials said. Dan Pfeiffer, the president\u2019s communications director at the time, blasted Mr. Krauthammer, calling his charge about the disappearing bust \u201c100 percent false\u201d and saying that \u201cnews outlets have debunked this claim time and again. \u201d In a blog post labeled a \u201cfact check\u201d on the White House website, Mr. Pfeiffer wrote: \u201cThe bust still in the White House. In the Residence. Outside the Treaty Room. \u201d Mr. Pfeiffer later apologized to Mr. Krauthammer after admitting that the bust outside the Treaty Room was, in fact, a different Churchill bust, given to President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s. Still, Mr. Pfeiffer insisted, the return of the Oval Office bust was \u201cnot something that President Obama or his administration chose to do\u201d and was not \u201ca symbol of President Obama\u2019s failure to appreciate the special relationship. \u201d But late last week, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, renewed the charge, writing in a British tabloid that the Oval Office bust had been \u201cbanished\u201d and suggesting that it could be \u201ca symbol of the   president\u2019s ancestral dislike of the British Empire  \u2014   of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender. \u201d Countering such charges is typically left to a president\u2019s aides. But asked at a news conference Friday about the mayor\u2019s comments, Mr. Obama seemed to relish the chance to set everyone straight, once and for all, about the fate of the Churchill bust. The president started by explaining that when it came to Churchill, \u201cI love the guy. \u201d He offered as proof the Churchill bust that sits outside the Treaty Room, the president\u2019s private office on the second floor of the White House residence, not far from the first family\u2019s living quarters. \u201cI see it every day, including on weekends, when I\u2019m going into that office to watch a basketball game,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary image I see is a bust of Winston Churchill. It\u2019s there voluntarily, because I can do anything on the second floor. I love Winston Churchill. \u201d But then Mr. Obama went on to explain what had happened to the bust lent by Mr. Blair, the one that critics had accused him of summarily sending back to the British. It was, Mr. Obama said, his decision to return that Churchill to his native land, because he wanted to replace it with a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cThere are only so many tables where you can put busts. Otherwise, it starts looking a little cluttered,\u201d the president explained. \u201cAnd I thought it was appropriate, and I suspect most people here in the United Kingdom might agree, that as the first   president, it might be appropriate to have a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King in my office. \u201d He added that the choice of Dr. King was \u201cto remind me of all the hard work of a lot of people who would somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office. \u201d That appears to contradict the longstanding denials by White House officials, including Mr. Pfeiffer, that neither Mr. Obama nor anyone else in his administration had chosen to dispatch Churchill\u2019s likeness in favor of someone else\u2019s. By Mr. Obama\u2019s admission, he made the decision to replace the Churchill bust with one of Dr. King. \u201cI think people should know my thinking there,\u201d Mr. Obama told the reporters in London. Mystery solved. Except for one thing: The version of events in which Lincoln had replaced Churchill was mentioned in most stories about the issue (including in this paper). Mr. Pfeiffer included news reports about it in his 2012 blog post attacking Mr. Krauthammer. \u201cThe A. P. reported that President Obama \u2018replaced the Oval Office fixture with a bust of one of his American heroes, President Abraham Lincoln,\u2019 \u201d he wrote. Mr. Pfeiffer no longer works for Mr. Obama he is now vice president of communications and policy for GoFundMe, a website that helps its users raise money for causes. Current White House officials said the Churchill bust had been replaced with one of Dr. King, but the Oval Office still has a Lincoln bust as well, perhaps leading to the confusion. After all, one White House official noted, Mr. Obama did say the Oval Office could get a little cluttered.'"}, "time": 1742562328.5949097}
