His skill for manipulating the past has made him something of an outlier: a   soul singer, songwriter and producer interested not in strict nostalgia, but in illuminating old styles so they shimmer in a way that\u2019s appealing to a listener not much interested in looking backward. This precision comes at a price, though. At times, Mr. Mars is a sideshow to his presentation. The sound is the star, and he is the vehicle, not the driver. \u201c24K Magic,\u201d his third album  \u2014   and first in four years  \u2014   is the story of that tension. Mr. Mars is by turns a showman and an analyst, a preservationist and a peacock. The new songs  \u2014   his most diverse set to date, and mostly rigorously executed and fun  \u2014   show Mr. Mars to be interested in different musical eras, different production approaches and different singing voices without veering into chaos. Mostly his songs are like cotton candy: sweet, sticky, structurally impressive but not especially deep. What\u2019s most striking about this album is how it expands upon Mr. Mars\u2019s longstanding interest in American soul music. Rather than linger in one time period, with one production approach, he\u2019s all over the map, from the 1950s to the \u201990s, and sniper sharp throughout. The title track, this album\u2019s lead single, is set to around 1980, when funk and machines were doing some of their earliest dances, and when black pop was still teeming with disco exuberance. It has less to do with the presence of Mr. Mars  \u2014   ecstatic, slick, ambient  \u2014   than the sheen of the production. The synthesizers are sympathetic and covered in burrs, and the vocals are   in a manner indebted to Zapp, who pioneered the sort of liquid digital funk Mr. Mars is repurposing (talkbox vocals pepper the song) and also to the duo Chromeo, who have been faithful revivalists of the style for years now. As for Mr. Mars, he\u2019s doing more emphatic talking than singing and is backed up by a barking chorus, adding   punch to his mellifluous boasts. Then there\u2019s \u201cPerm,\u201d which jolts back to the \u201960s, with its   and James   horn stabs and drums. Here, Mr. Mars trades his tender coo for a   vocal, as if sheer lust were rendering him hoarse. When he comes closer to the present day, or at least to the music he was raised on, Mr. Mars sounds most at home. Take the pairing of \u201cVersace on the Floor\u201d and \u201cFinesse,\u201d a   punch of    \u201980s RB evolution. \u201cVersace on the Floor\u201d is dreamy New Edition homage, with cool synthesizers forming a cradle for Mr. Mars, who begins the song singing tenderly, \u00e0 la Ralph Tresvant, \u201cUnderneath the  \u2019re dancing all alone. \u201d Later, though, is where he tweaks the original style, unleashing the more forceful side of his voice to curdle sweetness into hunger. A couple of songs after that comes \u201cFinesse,\u201d which takes the leap from 1984 to \u201988, with crackling drum machine production that harkens back to \u201cDon\u2019t Be Cruel,\u201d Bobby Brown\u2019s   Edition solo breakthrough album. That Mr. Mars can leap so effectively among sounds says a great deal about his strengths and weaknesses. He\u2019s not an especially imposing singer instead, he\u2019s a chameleon, without a signature flourish or tone. But that\u2019s fine, because it\u2019s as a producer  \u2014   he\u2019s credited here as Shampoo Press  Curl  \u2014   that he\u2019s most excited to show off his range. His ear is often astonishing, his gift for mimicry almost without equal. Other producers are credited here on certain songs  \u2014   the Stereotypes, Emile Haynie, Jeff Bhasker  \u2014   but they\u2019re all minor moons in Mr. Mars\u2019s fully realized soul universe.'"}, "time": 1742562085.10938}
