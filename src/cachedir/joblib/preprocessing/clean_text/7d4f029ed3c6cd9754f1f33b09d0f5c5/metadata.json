PAUL  \u2014   Demonstrators angered by the fatal police shooting of a black man during a suburban traffic stop kept vigil outside the governor\u2019s mansion here Friday as officials urged calm and more details emerged about the officer who fired the shots. Officer Jeronimo Yanez, who was placed on administrative leave after the killing on Wednesday night of the driver, Philando Castile, was a member of the St. Anthony police for four years. He had earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in law enforcement in 2010 and was honored by his college as a top student. In the years since graduating, he had posted online about a wedding and the birth of a child and settled into a suburban neighborhood. \u201cHe always wanted to dig deeper  \u2014   what if this happened, or that happened,\u201d said Christian Dobratz, one of Officer Yanez\u2019s professors at Minnesota State University, Mankato. \u201cI knew he was very big on wanting to work with others and serving a community,\u201d he added. But even as Officer Yanez\u2019s background became clearer, the specifics of the shooting that left Mr. Castile dead remained murky. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating, has said little about why Officer Yanez and a colleague pulled Mr. Castile over on a stretch of suburban road near the state fairgrounds, or what led to the shooting. Much of what is known comes from a Facebook Live video by Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend showing the emotional, gruesome aftermath. As that footage went viral online, protests have continued almost nonstop in St. Paul and the surrounding area, with activists calling for charges against Officer Yanez and a separate, federal investigation. In Falcon Heights, the suburb where Mr. Castile was shot, a group of university students and employees marched to the shooting scene to pay tribute Friday afternoon. And at the governor\u2019s residence in a residential area of St. Paul, demonstrators continued to mingle outside the gates. The protests have been large, spirited and almost entirely peaceful, though one person was arrested and a police car was damaged early Friday near Gov. Mark Dayton\u2019s home when demonstrations turned tense. So far, Justice Department officials have said they were monitoring the state investigation, but have not announced their own inquiry. John J. Choi, the prosecutor in Ramsey County, said he had urged the state agency investigating to be prompt and thorough, but did not offer a timeline on when a charging decision might be made. Mr. Choi, whose office will decide whether to bring charges, said he was unsure whether he would present the evidence to a grand jury or make the charging decision himself. Mr. Choi historically has used grand juries in police shooting cases and said he saw benefits in doing so, but that he would consider whether that was the right approach for Mr. Castile\u2019s case. \u201cI just need a little time and thought put into it,\u201d Mr. Choi said at a news conference at his downtown office. \u201cI think this is a very extraordinary case. \u201d If Mr. Choi opts to decide on charges himself, rather than presenting the case to grand jurors, he would be following his colleague in neighboring Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis. The prosecutor there, who also had long used grand juries for police shootings, changed his policy and decided himself to not charge the Minneapolis officers involved in last year\u2019s fatal shooting of Jamar Clark, another case that prompted widespread protests in this area. Governor Dayton, a Democrat, who angered some in law enforcement Thursday by saying he thought Mr. Castile probably would not have been shot if he were white, said Friday that he was standing by those comments. Mr. Dayton, who has at times mingled with the protesters outside his home, said he appreciated the demonstrators\u2019 peaceful tone. On Friday, he said he planned to meet with   pastors and civic leaders in the coming days, and called for people to \u201creact nonviolently. \u201d \u201cI make an appeal to everyone in Minnesota for calm, for understanding of this difficult time and the need for calm and nonviolence,\u201d said Mr. Dayton, who also spoke of a shooting in Minneapolis on Friday that left a toddler dead. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this terrible time here in Minnesota if we can all recognize that and not take any actions that are going to exacerbate a very difficult situation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564411.1566408}
