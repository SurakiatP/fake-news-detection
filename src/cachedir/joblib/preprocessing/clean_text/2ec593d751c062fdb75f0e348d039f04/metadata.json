Trump told Dr. Mehmet Oz that he didn\u2019t get much exercise these days. This is not really true. Even as he said it, he was in the middle of conducting a   spinning class. Mr. Trump\u2019s   appearance came in the midst of a news week focused on the presidential candidates\u2019 health. And Mr. Trump, the former host of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d   it like a   reveal. After days of    \u2019  as to whether Mr. Trump would provide the findings of a recent physical examination, daytime\u2019s favorite doctor walked the candidate through a   which Mr. Trump, as is his wont when   answered favorably. If you feel so confident, Dr. Oz finally asked, \u201cWhy not share your medical records?\u201d Mr. Trump responded like a knee to the tap of a mallet, producing two sheets of paper from his jacket as if they were the results of a dramatic elimination episode. The moment set off Mr. Trump\u2019s showman\u2019s instinct to engage the crowd. \u201cI have it right here,\u201d he said. \u201cShould I do it?\u201d Spoiler alert: He did. The move seemed to take Dr. Oz by surprise. He read over the letter quickly and approvingly, at one point interjecting, \u201cMy goodness!\u201d (He did later point out that Mr. Trump is overweight.) He commended Mr. Trump for participating. \u201cIn this modern era,\u201d Dr. Oz said, \u201cpeople expect to know enough about the people they\u2019re voting for. \u201d What Mr. Trump provided, it turned out, was a cursory summary of test results and other basic information, from the same personal physician who supplied him a bizarre, laudatory testimonial late last year. But for the nationwide audience, he created the impression of having been checked over and given a clean bill of health by the most famous surgeon in syndication. \u201cI view this as, in a way, going to see my doctor,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He left the appointment with much more than a lollipop. The man whom Oprah Winfrey called \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor\u201d had become, wittingly or not, Mr. Trump\u2019s spin doctor. The pairing made perfect showbiz sense. Dr. Oz has come to represent popular medical authority in the same way that Mr. Trump, through such platforms as \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d symbolizes business acumen. Dr. Oz may have come under fire for pushing supplements and \u201cmiracle\u201d fixes Mr. Trump may have suffered bankruptcies. But their branding speaks louder. The \u201cDr. Oz\u201d visit was announced last week. But when Hillary Clinton left the campaign trail with pneumonia after abruptly departing Sunday\u2019s Sept. 11 memorial ceremony, the appearance became doubly strategic. First, because the Clinton campaign delayed explaining her illness, it was a chance to portray Mr. Trump as the more forthcoming, even though Mrs. Clinton has released more detailed medical information. (Both have provided less than some past nominees.) Whether on taxes or medical history, Mr. Trump has been far from a transparent candidate. But he plays one on TV. Second, it underlined the    campaign theme that Mr. Trump has the most, you know, \u201cstamina. \u201d At a rally on Wednesday, he questioned whether Mrs. Clinton (who is on her second national campaign) could make it through the speech he was giving. In case that was too nuanced, Mr. Trump\u2019s medical letter included a reading of his testosterone level. The message  \u2014   as Mr. Trump said in a March debate regarding another physical aspect of his masculinity  \u2014   was, \u201cI guarantee you there\u2019s no problem. \u201d The visit\u2019s beneficial side effects included outreach to the largely female daytime audience, in front of a friendly questioner. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka joined him to plug his child care policy, without   questions on, say, the criticism that the plan gives more help to   families. Mr. Trump defended his past sexist banter on the Howard Stern radio show  \u2014   \u201cI was having fun\u201d  \u2014   and managed to get in a couple of digs at his opponent. When Dr. Oz asked him not to discuss Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump agreed, then added, \u201cWe want her to get well. \u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t think you can represent the country properly if you\u2019re not a healthy person,\u201d he said later.) But by the time the episode was broadcast, the important part of the show, for Mr. Trump\u2019s purposes, was already over. Because he taped the appearance Wednesday, Mr. Trump gained a day\u2019s worth of news clips showing him handing over two pages of  \u2014   something  \u2014   to the celebrity doctor and credulous headlines reporting his disclosure as the release of \u201cmedical records. \u201d Invested in the story, but without access to the information, news media grasped for snippets. \u201cAudience Member: Dr. Oz Impressed With Trump\u2019s Health,\u201d read a chyron on CNN. It was the theater of transparency masquerading as actual transparency  \u2014   a placebo. Now that Mr. Trump\u2019s doctor\u2019s letter has been released publicly, medical experts and journalists can assess what and how much it tells us  \u2014   most likely, to less attention. But the episode showed that the   instincts of America\u2019s    are quite healthy. In this news cycle\u2019s journey to Oz, Mr. Trump was the man behind the curtain.'"}, "time": 1742561680.8149345}
