That\u2019s because GMOs aren\u2019t allowed in organic. At least they haven\u2019t been, so far. Last week, our allies at Food DemocracyNOW! broke the news that Melody Meyer, a member of the Organic Trade Association (OTA), wants gene editing, a dangerous new form of genetic engineering, to be allowed in organic. Meyer said as much, in a blog post . Yep, higher ups at the OTA\u2014that \u201corganic\u201d Big Food front group that sold out the GMO labeling movement\u2014are at it again. First, they sold us out on the DARK Act, the bill that effectively killed GMO labeling in the U.S. Now, they want to use the loopholes and exemptions written into the DARK Act to force the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) to allow certain types of genetic engineering (some of which are referred to as GMO 2.0 ) to be allowed in organic. At its next meeting, November 16 \u2013 18, in St. Louis, Mo., the NOSB will consider an \u201cExcluded Methods Terminology\u201d proposal that could determine whether or not Meyer and her compatriots at the OTA score another win against organics. We say, no way. If you haven\u2019t already, please sign this petition to the NOSB demanding that all GMO technologies be kept out of certified organic products. TAKE ACTION BEFORE NOV. 15: Tell the National Organic Standards Board to keep genetically modified organisms out of certified \u2018USDA organic\u2019 food Support OCA\u2019s anti-GMO work (tax-deductible, helps support our work on behalf of organic standards, fair trade and public education) h/t: Organic Consumers Association'"}, "time": 1742628579.5055447}
