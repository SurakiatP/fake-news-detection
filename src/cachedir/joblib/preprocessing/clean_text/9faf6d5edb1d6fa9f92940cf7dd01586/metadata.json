He was 82. [Iranian media reported earlier Sunday that he was taken to a hospital north of Tehran because of a heart condition. State television broke into programming to announce his death.  Rafsanjani\u2019s mix of sly wit and reputation for cunning moves  \u2014   both in politics and business  \u2014   earned him a host of nicknames such as Akbar Shah, or Great King, during a life that touched every major event in Iranian affairs since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. His presence  \u2014   whether directly or through back channels  \u2014   was felt in many forms. He was a steady leader in Iran\u2019s turbulent years after overthrowing the U. S.  shah, a veteran warrior in the country\u2019s internal political battles and a covert   in intrigue such as the   arms deals in the 1980s. He also was handed an unexpected political resurgence in his later years. The surprise presidential election in 2013 of Rafsanjani\u2019s political soul mate, Hassan Rouhani, gave the former president an insider role in   efforts that included Rouhani\u2019s push for direct nuclear talks with Washington. Rouhani\u2019s victory was also another example of Rafsanjani\u2019s remarkable political luck. Rafsanjani was blocked from the ballot by Iran\u2019s election overseers  \u2014   presumably worried about boosting his already   influence. But, in the end, many liberals turned to Rouhani as an indirect vote for Rafsanjani. It came after years of dwindling influence. Another presidential comeback bid was snuffed out by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s surprise victory in 2005 elections, which left Rafsanjani and his powerful clan as fierce critics of Ahmadinejad.'"}, "time": 1742562131.543517}
