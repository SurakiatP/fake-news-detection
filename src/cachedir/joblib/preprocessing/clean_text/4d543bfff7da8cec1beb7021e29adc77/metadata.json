International Airport   zone, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (  ) makes clear that the federal government may no longer allow passengers to check a gun in their baggage. [According to NBC 6, Wasserman Schultz indicated that she wants to see the federal government do something. She said, \u201cWe certainly need to revisit and review whether or not you should be allowed to check firearms in your checked baggage and travel with them. \u201d  She also floated the option of creating a secure area where people who check guns have to go to pick up their firearm. And her third option was a ban on checking ammunition. Lost on Wasserman Schultz is the fact that Florida is one of only six states where it is illegal for concealed carry permit holders to carry a gun in unsecured areas for  . So large groups of unarmed innocents stand together in areas of the airport that lack security it is a mass public attacker\u2019s dream come true. Banning guns in checked baggage would do nothing to stop further attacks, as a criminal or terrorist with a gun can walk into the unsecured areas from the pickup curb and kill easily. The solution here is clear: eradicate the law that mandates that concealed carry permit holders be disarmed in baggage claim areas. This is a   action, rather than a federal one, and Representative Jake Raburn ( ) has already introduced legislation to repeal the   requirements. Under Raburn\u2019s plan, criminals and terrorists will have to deal with the fact that   citizens can shoot back.
