It isn\u2019t easy. For one thing, people sense a stranger in their midst as acutely as a herd of gazelles might, and they tend to scatter, or stare from a distance in a menacing way. Over the years, I have filled many spiral notebooks with quotations. On the subject of love, clich\u00e9s are hard to avoid. I have heard, \u201c  are like two pieces of a puzzle,\u201d or \u201cIt was     to be\u201d thousands of times, or that\u2019s how it feels anyway. Occasionally, though, people say something original and sparkly about love, and as a reporter, I want to hug them. It\u2019s like finding a diamond in the sand. As a sort of   to all of those whom I have written about, and those whom I have written for, here are 10 of those jewels: 1. \u201cIn a sense, the person we marry is a stranger about whom we have a magnificent hunch. \u201d This is my   favorite quotation about marriage, spoken during a 1992 wedding in a small, unheated chapel in Cold Spring, N. Y. and sourced from the 1991 book \u201cWeddings From the Heart\u201d by Daphne Rose Kingma. In its own way, the quotation also explains a lot about divorce. 2. This remark, from a Vows column about the 1995 wedding of Elizabeth Burbank and LaMott Britto, describes how it feels to finally find a partner: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like a fish out of water, and when I met LaMott it was like he was the same fish. \u201d  3. According to Stacy Cor, who became engaged to Dan Polner 10 days after they met on an airplane in 1993, examination should not be necessary to determine if love is real. \u201cWhen you know you know, and don\u2019t believe it any other way,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone asks you to marry them, you shouldn\u2019t have to make a list of pros and cons. You just know. You jump into their arms and say, \u2018Yeah! \u2019\u201d 4. For some, \u201cknowing\u201d is not so obvious. This is how Patricia Durkin knew Kenneth Wignall, whom she would marry in 1995, was right for her: \u201cOne night, a moth was flying around a light bulb and he caught it and let it out the window. I said: \u2018That\u2019s it. He\u2019s the guy. \u2019\u201d This quotation also speaks to the fruitlessness of trying to impress someone with a certain look, attribute, political affiliation or apartment d\u00e9cor. The things that spark attention and interest are often mysteries, even to ourselves. So throw out the list. 5. When brides and grooms describe their first or second meetings, they often say they feel as if they have known each other forever, possibly even in former lives. \u201cI feel like Sean and I have known each other since the beginning of time,\u201d Meghan Milewski said of Sean Yeaton, whom she married in 2013. \u201cI always tell him, \u2018After we die, we have to find each other in our next life.\u2019 I also tell him if I die before him, I really want him to fall in love again. But in our next lifetime, he has to find me, not her. That\u2019s the deal. \u201d  6. Sometimes, you only learn what love is by breaking up. Before Eames Yates and Pamela Taylor were married in 2006 in Snowmass, Colo. they separated for a period of time that was especially excruciating for Mr. Yates. It was also illuminating: \u201cI now know what love is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s when someone becomes part of every breath, in what way I do not know. But I couldn\u2019t breathe without her. \u201d  7. Billboards and big diamonds are not necessary for proposals to be romantic. This is how Gabriela Power Porto described the marriage proposal Peter Castaldi put forth, more than two decades ago, one of the sweetest I ever heard: \u201cWhen he gave me the ring, he said: \u2018It\u2019s not a big stone you can\u2019t carry around. This ring won\u2019t put you in danger on the subways.\u2019 He said, \u2018This is a solid ring, like my promises. \u2019\u201d  8. How should you feel on your wedding day? There are no rules, but this is how Ryan Baker described the day of his 1995 wedding to Brett Savage: \u201cIt was like a dream. It was surreal. In life, you don\u2019t have to search for bad things  \u2014   they find you without a problem. Disasters always seem to know your address, even if you move. But the good times, they\u2019re hard to find, and this one was one of those truly spectacular times. \u201d  9. Of all the homemade vows I\u2019ve heard, one spoken by Melissa Richard during her 1996 wedding to Frank J. Oteri sums up the reason we continue to marry, against the odds: \u201cOf my own accord, I present myself, my days, my nights and my life. I present them freely and willingly because they cannot be better spent than in your company. \u201d More than a few couples I\u2019ve interviewed have described love as a good conversation that lasts. 10. However, nothing lasts forever (unless you believe in reincarnation). The Rev. William G. Kalaidjian, who was known as Reverend Bill and died in 2015, was the officiant at one of the first weddings I covered, in 1992. He lived in a house full of noisy clocks. \u201cI like to hear the tick, tick, tick of clocks,\u201d he said. \u201cI always tell the couples I marry, \u2018Take time before time takes you. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628587.4857104}
