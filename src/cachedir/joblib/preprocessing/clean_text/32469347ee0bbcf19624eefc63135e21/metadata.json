So have singers (Sonny Bono)  high school football coaches (Rob Ford) and media moguls (Michael Bloomberg). Why not somebody from the art world? On Tuesday, a    curator and artist, Ingrid LaFleur, threw her hat into the ring for this year\u2019s mayoral race in Detroit, a city where municipal finances and art have been uncomfortable bedfellows in recent years. During the city\u2019s federal bankruptcy proceedings in 2013 and 2014, creditors pushed for the sale of valuable pieces from the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Ms. LaFleur, a Detroit native, helped establish an artist\u2019s residency program at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and founded an   art and film program, Afrotopia, in Detroit. She said in an interview that after returning to her hometown after several years in New York and elsewhere, \u201cI was at once very shocked at the state of the city, and at the same time really impressed with all the creative and social justice communities that were growing here. \u201d \u201cI think this is our moment to reimagine not just the city, but city governing,\u201d she said. \u201cHow we can truly govern in a way that supports our citizens in the work that they\u2019re already doing and not create barriers to make it more difficult?\u201d She said she was nearing the 500 petition signatures needed to get her name added to the ballot to challenge Mayor Mike Duggan, the first white mayor of the   city since 1973, who has announced he will run again. (Ms. LaFleur is  .) The Detroit Free Press reported that 15 people had taken out petitions so far to run for mayor but that no significant challenger to Mr. Duggan, a Democrat elected in 2013, had yet emerged. The primary is Aug. 8, and the nonpartisan election Nov. 7. Ms. LaFleur said she considered her lack of campaign or governing experience a plus in a city with a long history of municipal corruption. \u201cI\u2019m hyperaware of what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not na\u00efve about the political landscape of Detroit. But I\u2019m a person who\u2019s not beholden to anyone except the citizens of Detroit. I can be someone to reimagine the role of politician because I don\u2019t have that kind of background. \u201d She added: \u201cAs curator and artist I\u2019ve learned how to bring people together, to solve problems creatively, to be a good organizer, a good researcher. \u201d What about a good  ? \u201cI know that Duggan raised $3 million for his run,\u201d Ms. LaFleur said. \u201cI won\u2019t say I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m just going to say that\u2019s not our focus. \u201d \u201cWe plan to tap into the huge art and creative community that has taken root in this city, to reach voters through them,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, if we could raise that kind of money we\u2019d be very happy, and we\u2019d use it wisely. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563760.5835922}
