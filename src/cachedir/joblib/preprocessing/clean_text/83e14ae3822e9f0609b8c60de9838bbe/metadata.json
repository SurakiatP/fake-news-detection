Witnesses offered varying descriptions of the fatal encounter. Investigators examined bloodstain evidence on the street where Mr. Brown died. And the police released a security video from a nearby store that showed Mr. Brown pushing a worker and taking cigarillos minutes before the shooting. But a second, previously unreported video from that same convenience store included in a new documentary is raising new questions about what happened in the hours before the shooting on Aug. 9, 2014. The footage shows Mr. Brown entering the store, Ferguson Market and Liquor, shortly after 1 a. m. on the day he died. He approaches the counter, hands over an item that appears to be a small bag and takes a shopping sack filled with cigarillos. Mr. Brown is shown walking toward the door with the sack, then turning around and handing the cigarillos back across the counter before exiting. Jason Pollock, a documentary filmmaker who acquired the new tape, says the footage challenges the police narrative that Mr. Brown committed a   robbery when he returned to the store around noon that day. Instead, Mr. Pollock believes that the new video shows Mr. Brown giving a small bag of marijuana to store employees and receiving cigarillos in return as part of a negotiated deal. Mr. Pollock said Mr. Brown left the cigarillos behind the counter for safekeeping. \u201cThere was some type of exchange, for one thing, for another,\u201d Lesley McSpadden, Mr. Brown\u2019s mother, says in Mr. Pollock\u2019s documentary, \u201cStranger Fruit,\u201d which premiered Saturday at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex. and examines the shooting from the family\u2019s perspective. But Jay Kanzler, a lawyer for the convenience store and its employees, strongly disputes that version of events, and said the new footage is unrelated to Mr. Brown\u2019s later visit to the store. \u201cThere was no transaction,\u201d Mr. Kanzler said. \u201cThere was no understanding. No agreement. Those folks didn\u2019t sell him cigarillos for pot. The reason he gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they wanted it back. \u201d Regardless of what happened at the store in the   hours, the new security footage does not resolve   questions about Mr. Brown\u2019s encounter with Officer Darren Wilson along a Ferguson street that day. Officer Wilson, who claimed that he feared for his life and had been assaulted by Mr. Brown, was cleared of criminal wrongdoing by a county grand jury and federal civil rights investigators. He resigned from the Police Department. Mr. Brown\u2019s death and the sometimes violent protests that followed raised broad questions about how police officers treat black people, both in the St. Louis area and across the country, and many remain steadfast in their belief that Mr. Brown was murdered. Protesters were particularly offended by the Ferguson Police Department\u2019s decision to release the video that showed Mr. Brown shoving the store clerk, perceiving it as part of an effort to defame and demonize the young man. Ms. McSpadden, who also spells her first name as Lezley, questioned why that tape was released publicly while her son\u2019s earlier visit to the store had been kept quiet. \u201cThey destroyed Michael\u2019s character with the tape, and they didn\u2019t show us what actually happened,\u201d said Mr. Pollock, who spent more than two years in Ferguson conducting research for his documentary, and who questions the decision to not charge Officer Wilson. \u201cSo this shows their intention to make him look bad. And shows suppression of evidence. \u201d The St. Louis County Police Department briefly mentioned Mr. Brown\u2019s   visit to the store in a lengthy report on the case, which tipped Mr. Pollock off to the existence of an additional video. Sgt. Shawn McGuire, a spokesman for the county police, said in an email on Saturday that footage of the earlier encounter had not been released because it was not relevant to the investigation. He added later that he could not confirm the video\u2019s authenticity. Spokesmen for the city of Ferguson and the St. Louis County prosecutor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. Mr. Brown\u2019s parents have filed a federal lawsuit against Officer Wilson, the city of Ferguson and the former Ferguson police chief. A civil trial is scheduled to start next year.'"}, "time": 1742563889.922108}
