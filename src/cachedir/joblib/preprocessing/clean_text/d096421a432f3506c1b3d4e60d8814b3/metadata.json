(See images of the materials Jena and David say they found at the end of this article. Also included are two images from Democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters.) \\n\u201cI found a letter from the governor of Virginia asking me to please vote Democrat and \u2018help keep Virginia blue\u2019 this year,\u201d Jena explained. \u201cThen I got a letter from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, giving me a step-by-step, yes-and-no what I should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot.\u201d \\nIn recent days, at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots. \\nAfter the report was first published, and shared on Facebook by David Jones, Fairfax County Democratic Committee Executive Director Frank Anderson replied to David\u2019s post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained. \\n\u201cThese materials were NOT sent in the same envelope as the ballot. The ballot is mailed separately by the Office of Elections. Political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots. The two envelopes arrived at the same time,\u201d commented Anderson. \\nThat triggered a quick back-and-forth between David Jones and Anderson. \\n\u201cI hate to tell you but you\u2019re wrong. All items came in one envelope,\u201d Jones said. \\nLike the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America\u2019s independent news network. \\n\u201cImpossible. That letter came out of my office. We never have access to other people\u2019s ballots,\u201d replied Anderson. \\n\u201cThen it seems those that sent the ballots have access to YOUR letters,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWho should I believe? You or my lying eyes?\u201d \\nAnderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot, and mailings are sent to those voters to promote Democratic Party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives. \\n\u201cI am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed. We are a political office and have no business handling anyone\u2019s ballots. You can believe what you want to believe,\u201d concluded Anderson. \\nThe Virginia Department of Elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response. But after seeing reports from WND and Radio America, Anderson protested the premise of the story. \\n\u201cPlease stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim,\u201d stated Anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the Jones account could not be accurate. \\nHe shared a photo sent by State Sen. Scott Surovell, showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing Democratic Party advocacy. \\nIn a formal interview, FCDC Communications Adviser Bruce Neilson told WND and Radio America the Jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible,\u201d said Neilson, who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local Democrats. \\n\u201cVoting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe activity of voting is also a public record. The Fairfax County Democratic Committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot. We get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed. \\n\u201cThe same day the ballot is mailed, our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the Fairfax (County) Democratic Committee knows to be Democratic positions on the ballot,\u201d said Neilson, noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax. \\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with Bruce Neilson: \\nHowever, he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself. \\n\u201cThat material is mailed in a separate envelope, labeled with our initials \u2013 FCDC \u2013 and our return address in Fairfax, Virginia, and would be received either the same day, perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government,\u201d Neilson said. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a separate mailing. It\u2019s a separate stamp. It\u2019s a separate envelope. It\u2019s very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while you\u2019re filling in your votes,\u201d he said. \\nJones is standing by her story 100 percent, as is her husband. David says it\u2019s a very clear memory. \\n\u201cJena opened the envelope that contained her ballot, the green sample ballot, the two-sided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying \u2018go vote\u2019 or something of that nature. There was also the return envelope, which I signed,\u201d David said. \\nThe coverage of Jena\u2019s story has also elicited similar stories from two other Fairfax County voters. Both of them commented on Reddit. \\n\u201cI can confirm this. I live in Herndon, VA (Fairfax County) and also received these materials in my absentee ballot. I thought it was fishy at the time but didn\u2019t look into it,\u201d stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename. \\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

They don\u2019t go anywhere else. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible that the county government is distributing partisan Democratic materials. It\u2019s never happened before. I\u2019m not aware of it happening now. And I don\u2019t think that it would happen anywhere in the future,\u201d Neilson said. \\nThere are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in Fairfax County, leading David Jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible. He accepts the explanation that the Fairfax County Democratic Committee is not responsible for what he and Jena discovered with her ballot. \\n\u201cI understand Frank\u2019s comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots. I believe that,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material. I don\u2019t see how Frank\u2019s office could be held accountable for what\u2019s in the ballot envelope. But it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues.\u201d \\nNeilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true. \\n\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail,\u201d Neilson said. \\nHe also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight. \\n\u201cI am an election official. On Election Day, I serve in a non-partisan capacity for our county election office,\u201d Nielson said. \u201cI can assure you, you have Democrats and Republicans working in the office. You have plenty of oversight of the voting process, and there\u2019s no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot. There is no way that happened.\u201d \\nThe following are three images of the Democratic Party materials Jena and David Jones say they found stuffed inside the absentee ballot: \\nThe following are two images from Democrats who say the voters must be confused:'"}, "time": 1742563363.459046}
