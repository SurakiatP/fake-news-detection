[Judd\u2019s comments came during an interview with Fox Business Channel\u2019s Stuart Varney where he addressed the dramatic impact the Trump Administration has already had on reducing illegal border crossings. \u201cSpeaker Paul Ryan is suggesting that Congress delay border wall funding until next year,\u201d Varney stated. \u201cWhat do you say about that?\u201d  \u201cI disagree,\u201d Judd said flatly. \u201cPresident Trump promised that he was going to secure the border, and part of securing the border is putting in place, the proper technology and resources that allows us to be successful and a border wall in strategic locations is one of those things that we must get done. \u201d Ryan\u2019s comments that he may delay funding the border wall came during a March interview with Norah O\u2019Donnell on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d. \u201cThe big chunk of money for the border wall really is next year\u2019s fiscal appropriations,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBecause they literally can\u2019t start construction even this quickly. \u201d The Trump Administration is moving forward with the bidding process, Breitbart Texas reported. Officials are expected to choose 4 to 10 companies to build a prototype section of wall to demonstrate their bid\u2019s viability and effectiveness. Officials with knowledge of the plan spoke to the Daily Mail on condition of anonymity and said contractors would build the prototypes on a   strip of   land near San Diego. Trump began seeking bids to build prototypes of the wall in February, Breitbart Texas reported. More than 300 companies quickly signed up to present proposals on how to take the President\u2019s vision and promise to reality.
