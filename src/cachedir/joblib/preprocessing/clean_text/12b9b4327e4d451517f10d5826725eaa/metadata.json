The suit sets up a potential confrontation between the Trump administration and Twitter over digital privacy, a thorny issue that has driven a wedge between the technology industry and government in the past. Twitter disclosed in a federal court filing on Thursday that it had received a summons directing it to reveal the identity or identities of those behind @ALT_USCIS, one of several     run by people purporting to be current or former federal employees. The @ALT_USCIS account, which quickly gained tens of thousands of followers, has frequently criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies and enforcement actions. Twitter said in its filing that it could not be compelled to disclose the identity or identities of whoever is behind the account. The company argued that the government\u2019s directive and reasoning were unlawful, and that complying would have \u201ca grave chilling effect\u201d on the speech of   that voice resistance to government policies. \u201cA   tradition of pseudonymous free speech on matters of public moment runs deep in the political life of America,\u201d Twitter said in its filing. \u201cThese First Amendment interests are at their zenith when, as here, the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life. \u201d Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection had issued the summons, declined to comment. Even before this episode, previous presidential administrations have sought access the valuable digital information held by Facebook, Google, Twitter and other internet companies, in what some of the companies have said is an overreach of government power. Federal officials have typically said in such cases that they need the data at issue for national security or other reasons. Last year, for example, Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, squared off against the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a contentious case involving issues of privacy and national security. The F. B. I. asked Apple to unlock an iPhone that had been used by a gunman in a 2015 attack in San Bernardino, Calif. in which 14 people were fatally shot. Apple refused, citing its customers\u2019 privacy concerns and the potential legal precedent. The F. B. I. dropped the matter after finding another way to open the iPhone without Apple\u2019s help. The new case involving Twitter is more straightforward than Apple\u2019s standoff with the F. B. I. which required the creation of new technology to circumvent the iPhone\u2019s encryption. The Twitter case is centered instead on the protection of free speech, which is critical to the social media company\u2019s platform. Twitter has a history of protecting its users\u2019 First Amendment rights. In 2012, it filed an appeal in a New York State court to protect account information believed to have been used by an Occupy Wall Street protester. The company has also sued the federal government over rules related to whether it would be allowed to simply disclose requests for user data from federal agencies. Mr. Trump himself is a   Twitter user, regularly sending out incendiary missives about the economy, politics and all manner of other topics from his @realDonaldTrump account. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it planned to represent the anonymous user or users behind @ALT_USCIS. \u201cTo unmask an anonymous speaker online, the government must have a strong justification,\u201d said Nathan Freed Wessler, an A. C. L. U. attorney involved in the case. \u201cBut in this case the government has given no reason at all, leading to concerns that it is simply trying to stifle dissent. \u201d The case stems from a wave of alternative government agency accounts that sprouted on Twitter after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Upon being sworn into office, the president began to silence federal agencies from speaking out on the social media platform after the National Park Service\u2019s official Twitter account posted    images comparing the size of the crowds at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration \u201cto the apparently larger crowd size at President Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration,\u201d according to Twitter\u2019s court filing. In response, alternative accounts began to pop up, with many professing to be written by current or former employees of federal agencies. Accounts with handles like @Alt_Labor, @BadlandsNPS and @RogueEPAstaff had attracted tens of thousands of followers less than a week after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Many of the accounts have since posted messages in opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s views. The @Alt_CDC account, for instance, once called the prospect of a \u201cvaccine review committee\u201d  \u2014   an idea that Mr. Trump had discussed with others  \u2014   a \u201cserious threat to global public health. \u201d The @ALT_USCIS account, which was created in January, has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, among other topics. Messages posted by the account have referred to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order restricting travel to the United States by people from several mostly Muslim countries as the \u201c#MuslimBan. \u201d The account has also described itself as \u201cofficial inside resistance\u201d and has said several times that the person or people using it to post messages is a current federal employee of Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Homeland Security Department. Twitter said in its court filing that about 19, 000 employees and contractors work for Citizenship and Immigration Services. In March, Customs and Border Protection sent Twitter a summons that ordered the company to hand over information about the @ALT_USCIS account, including the names, phone numbers, mailing addresses and internet protocol addresses of the account holder or holders. The summons cited 19 U. S. Code 1509, a federal law that authorizes Customs and Border Protection to \u201cobtain documents only for investigations and inquiries relating to the importation of merchandise. \u201d Twitter said the law was not relevant to the agency\u2019s request and also that the summons violated the Stored Communications Act, which protects individuals\u2019 privacy and proprietary interests. As for @ALT_USCIS, the account was particularly active on Thursday, posting more than a dozen messages after Twitter\u2019s suit against the government became public. The account, which added 32, 000 followers within two months of being started, had ballooned to more than 77, 000 followers by early in the evening.
