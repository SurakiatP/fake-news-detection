Trump and prominent black leaders, Mr. Trump met privately on Monday with the eldest son of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the holiday devoted to the civil rights hero. The hastily arranged meeting at Trump Tower occurred as Mr. Trump feuded publicly with  Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, who fought for civil rights alongside Dr. King. It has highlighted the challenges Mr. Trump faces as he prepares to take office on Friday deeply distrusted by minorities across the country, many of whom have been offended by his false allegations that President Obama was born outside the United States, appalled that his candidacy drew backing from white supremacist organizations, and dismayed at policy proposals they consider antithetical to their interests. Mr. Trump on Monday did not address those issues, appearing in the lobby to allow news cameras to capture pictures of him shaking hands with Martin Luther King III, but ignoring questions shouted by reporters about their conversation or his statements about Mr. Lewis. Tentative plans for Mr. Trump to visit the Smithsonian Museum of   History and Culture in Washington, as the nation paused to remember Dr. King, had been shelved in favor of the   session, which lasted just under one hour. But Mr. Trump made sure that journalists had an opportunity to see him with Mr. King, a visual manifestation of his stated aspiration to unite a divided nation. Mr. King said the session, which included a discussion about voting rights, had been \u201cconstructive,\u201d and described Mr. Trump as eager to present himself as inclusive. \u201cHe said that he is going to represent Americans  \u2014   he\u2019s said that over and over again,\u201d Mr. King, the president of the Drum Major Institute, a progressive New   public policy organization, told reporters. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate that. \u201d On Monday, Mr. King sought to defuse the furor surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about Mr. Lewis, saying, \u201cIn the heat of emotion, a lot of things get said on both sides. \u201d Mr. King has pressed for the creation of a free photographic government identification card to make it easier for Americans who do not have driver\u2019s licenses, including many black voters, to cast ballots, and he indicated on Monday that Mr. Trump had taken an interest in the plan. \u201cIt is very clear that the system is not working at its maximum,\u201d Mr. King told reporters. \u201cWe believe we provided a solution. \u201d But other leaders said Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with    \u2014   tense bordering on toxic after a strident campaign that instilled fear, and a transition that has done little to allay their concerns  \u2014   would not improve unless the   altered both his tone and his policy positions. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety, there\u2019s a lot of distrust, there are people who have expressed to me that they\u2019re scared of what his policies might entail,\u201d said Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League. Mr. Trump won election with 8 percent of the   vote, according to exit polls. A Pew Research Center poll in November found roughly   of African Americans believed race relations would worsen during his presidency. The Rev. Al Sharpton said nothing underscored Mr. Trump\u2019s challenge more vividly than his outburst in a pair of Twitter postings on Saturday that called Mr. Lewis, who was brutally beaten in the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march in 1965 in Selma, Ala. \u201call talk,\u201d and said that instead of \u201cfalsely complaining\u201d about the election results, he should focus on fixing his \u201cfalling apart\u201d and \u201ccrime infested\u201d Georgia district. Mr. Lewis actually represents a district that includes part of the wealthy enclave of Buckhead the world\u2019s busiest airport,   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks were a reaction to an interview on Friday in which Mr. Lewis said he would not attend the inauguration and did not see Mr. Trump as a legitimate president because of questions about whether Russian hacking had affected the American election. \u201cIf you can disrespect John Lewis on Martin Luther King Day, then what are you saying about the rest of us?\u201d Mr. Sharpton said, adding that no single meeting Mr. Trump could hold would alleviate the concerns felt in the   community. \u201cHe seems to have a   very negative view of what black America looks like, and that is frightening to many black Americans. \u201d Mr. Sharpton said he was concerned that Mr. Trump was more interested in public appearances than substantive meetings with   activists and lawmakers to address issues of voting rights, criminal justice and policing reform, health care and economic inequality. \u201cHe still thinks that we\u2019re playing television red carpet here, rather than dealing with the presidency of the United States, with something of real substance. This is not a \u201d Rev. Sharpton said. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary and communications director, announced the meeting in New York between Mr. Trump and Mr. King in a morning posting on Twitter. In a series of television interviews on Monday, Mr. Spicer said Mr. Lewis had started the fight with his \u201cdisappointing\u201d assertion that Mr. Trump was not a legitimate president, and he defended the  \u2019s decision to respond, telling CBS that the   is \u201cnot going to sit back and just take attacks without responding. \u201d Still, Mr. Trump himself had seemed to temper his attack on Mr. Lewis subtly by Saturday night he said that the congressman should help him focus on \u201cburning and crime infested  \u201d throughout the United States and added, \u201cI can use all the help I can get!\u201d Outside the   history museum in Washington on Monday, some visitors argued that the episode said more about the  \u2019s thin skin than his views on race. \u201cSomebody said something bad and he\u2019s got to say something back,\u201d said Nancy Alston of Columbia, Md. \u201cHe said bad stuff about Meryl Streep, too. \u201d Ginelle Johnson, 35, of San Diego, said that she believed Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were motivated by how he views minorities. But she also said that they appeared to show his proclivity to hit back at whoever criticizes him. \u201cPolitics has become entertainment and I think Trump is just a bully,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. Mr. Trump\u2019s brief sighting on Monday afternoon at Trump Tower was a striking contrast to President Obama, who spent part of Monday  \u2014   his final observance of Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday in office  \u2014   making a stop at a homeless shelter in Washington. Earlier, his wife, Michelle Obama, had spoken out subtly in her own Twitter post, saying she was, \u201cThinking of Dr. King and great leaders like @repjohnlewis who carry on his legacy. \u201d \u201cMay their example be our call to action,\u201d she wrote.'"}, "time": 1742563012.0795321}
