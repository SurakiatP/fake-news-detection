Both priests tried to take photos of the children with their mobile phones, but the youngsters were too quick and managed to escape. \\nAlexandra Rang, a Russian Orthodox hotel owner who built the chapel a few years ago, said she could not believe what the two priests told her at first. She said to be pelted with stones is the \u201cworst thing a priest can imagine\u201d. \\nRaunheim social worker Dr. Isack Majura said he was going to do everything possible to get hold of the children. He said: \u201cWhat happened is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d \\nMunicipal staff said different religious groups in Frankfurt are generally on good terms and they are treating the incident as isolated . He said there has been a strong Christian-Muslim dialogue between the local mosque and church communities which has been cultivated over many years. \\nGermany is facing a crisis following Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s open-door migrant policy which saw more than 1.1million refugees entering the country last year. \\nShe is now backtracking on the policy, closing up some of Germany\u2019s borders, but in some areas the impact is being heavily felt. \\nYesterday, Express.co.uk revealed pupils at a girl\u2019s primary school in the German ski resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen are being forced to chant \u201cAllahu Akhbar\u201d and \u201cthere is no God but Allah\u201d. A father of a pupil claimed his daughter had been \u201c forced \u201d by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants. \\nWeeks before, parents complained their children\u2019s nursery was refusing to acknowledge \u201cChristmas rituals\u201d such as putting up a Christmas tree or singing carols to accommodate the \u201cdiverse cultures\u201d of other pupils. \\nThe school said they made the decision because the majority of children at the kindergarten are not Christian. \\nMigrants now outnumber native children in many Germany schools. \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742628505.1462271}
