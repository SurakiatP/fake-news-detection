[Whatever your political persuasion, the actual game on Super Bowl Sunday should prove fun to watch. Neither the cast of the Mike   musical Hamilton singing \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d pregame nor   Lady Gaga performing the halftime show, or commercials with political agendas, can ruin a game, featuring two great quarterbacks, New England\u2019s Tom Brady and Atlanta\u2019s Matt Ryan.  Let\u2019s take a closer look at the football game, which likely plays as a nice   escape from political football. One of the great   in this contest features Ryan against a superb Patriots secondary: cornerbacks Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan, along with safeties Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung. They all play on a high level. However, the Patriots\u2019 secondary faces a Herculian challenge against the Falcons\u2019 coterie of   weapons, led by wide receiver Julio Jones, who averaged more than 100 receiving yards a game this season. If you take away Jones, Ryan happily targets other talented wideouts such as Mo Sanu or speedy Taylor Gabriel, or perhaps one of three talented tight ends. \u201cAs a defensive coordinator, you really have to pick your poison, and decide what you want to take away,\u201d Jones said. And the poison includes a tailback tandem that can hurt you running and receiving. Atlanta\u2019s dynamic duo of Davonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman combined for 2, 482 yards and 24 touchdowns this season. This pair of powerful runners are passing game weapons as well, combining for 85 receptions and 883 yards. The Patriots aren\u2019t easy to run against with a cornucopia of talented, massive defensive linemen such as Alan Branch and Malcolm Brown. \u201cThey have big heavy guys up front that are \u201d said Falcons center Alex Mack. And Mack, Atlanta\u2019s outstanding center, isn\u2019t healthy. He\u2019s dealing with a painful left fibula injury, and will probably need a Toradol shot to get through the game. \u201cI\u2019m concerned,\u201d Falcons coach Dan Quinn said about Mack. \u201cI\u2019m not panicked, but I\u2019m concerned. \u201d With a   quarterback and a coterie of weapons, the Falcons certainly shouldn\u2019t struggle scoring, but they can score enough? Can they keep up with the Brady? While Atlanta\u2019s defense has improved from early in the season, it\u2019s still not an elite unit. In their regular season finale, a   win over New Orleans, Saints QB Drew Brees threw for 350 yards, wide receiver Michael Thomas snagged 10 catches for 156 yards and tailback Mark Ingram rushed for 102 yards. After watching this tape, Brady likely chomps at the bit. The Falcons start three defensive rookies  \u2014   safety Keanu Neal and linebackers De\u2019Vondre Campbell and Deion Jones. They also feature a rookie nickel back, Brian Poole, who plays a lot. Brady is superb at manipulating defenders with his eyes  \u2014   throwing them off the trail of where he intends to throw. Rookies are particularly vulnerable to this chicanery. Expect Brady to target these rookies. \u201cBrady is going to find out what the kids know,\u201d said SiriusXM NFL Radio analyst Pat Kirwan. \u201cI would expect him to [go after the rookies],\u201d said Neal. \u201cI would expect him to go to a guy that doesn\u2019t have as much as experience as others. \u201d Neal embraces the challenge. \u201cBring it on,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI\u2019m not scared. \u201d Be careful what you wish for. Brady, looking for his fifth Super Bowl victory, is coming off a virtuoso performance vs. Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game, throwing for 384 yards and three touchdowns. At 39, Brady is still at the top of his game, and wants to play six more years. \u201cYou combine his competitiveness, his preparation, his accuracy and his toughness with his memory, you\u2019ve got the best quarterback to ever play,\u201d Houston Texans coach Bill O\u2019Brien, a former Patriots assistant, told the Boston Herald. A good way to mess with Brady is with interior pressure. \u201cThe best way to disrupt [his] rhythm has always been pressuring Brady from the center of the pocket,\u201d Falcons coach Dan Quinn said. \u201cMany times, when [pressure] comes from the edge he\u2019s able to step up and find an extra [second] worth of time to find a free receiver. \u201d And blitzing Brady a lot isn\u2019t a good idea. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a blitz I haven\u2019t seen,\u201d said Brady, a   NFL starting QB. The New York Giants beat him in a pair of Super Bowls (2007 and 2011) without blitzing. They relied on their front four to pressure him, allowing them to drop seven guys into coverage. \u201cWhen you can affect him with a   rush, it\u2019s absolutely pivotal for our defense,\u201d said Falcons defensive tackle Tyson Jackson. \u201cYou can drop more in coverage. \u201d Plus, if you blitz, you aren\u2019t likely to get there the Patriots allowed only 24 sacks in the regular season. Aside from Brady\u2019s greatness, another problem for the Falcons  \u2014   they are sans their top cornerback Desmond Trufant, on injured reserve. \u201c[The Falcons] will lose, if their defense isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d said retired coach Dick Vermeil. It probably isn\u2019t. The pick here is New England.'"}, "time": 1742562310.9877312}
