The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. \\n2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. \\n3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret server on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. \\n4. Sources within the FBI have told Baier that an indictment is \u201clikely\u201d in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, \u201cbarring some obstruction in some way\u201d from the Justice Department. \\n5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton\u2019s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information have been taken from it. \\nTranscript: \\nBRET BAIER: Breaking news tonight \u2014 two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations into the Clinton emails and the Clinton Foundation tell Fox the following: \\nThe investigation looking into possible pay-for-play interaction between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Foundation has been going on for more than a year. Led by the white collar crime division, public corruption branch of the criminal investigative division of the FBI. \\nThe Clinton Foundation investigation is a, quote, \u201cvery high priority.\u201d Agents have interviewed and reinterviewed multiple people about the Foundation case, and even before the WikiLeaks dumps, agents say they have collected a great deal of evidence. Pressed on that, one sources said, quote, \u201ca lot of it,\u201d and \u201cthere is an avalanche of new information coming every day.\u201d \\nSome of it from WikiLeaks, some of it from new emails. The agents are actively and aggressively pursuing this case. They will be going back to interview the same people again, some for the third time. \\nAs a result of the limited immunity deals to top aides, including Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, the Justice Department had tentatively agreed that the FBI would destroy those laptops after a narrow review. We are told definitively that has not happened. Those devices are currently in the FBI field office here in Washington, D.C. and are being exploited. \\nThe source points out that any immunity deal is null and void if any subject lied at any point in the investigation. \\nMeantime, the classified e-mail investigation is being run by the National Security division of the FBI. They are currently combing through former Democratic Congressman Anthony Wiener\u2019s laptop and have found e-mails that they believe came from Hillary Clinton\u2019s server that appear to be new, as in not duplicates. \\nWhether they contain classified material or not is not yet known. It will likely be known soon. All of this just as we move inside one week until election day. \\nBaier gives more details to Fox News Channel\u2019s Brit Hume. \\nTranscript: \\nBRET BAIER: Here\u2019s the deal: We talked to two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations. One: The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far\u2026 Several offices separately have been doing their own investigations. \\nTwo: The immunity deal that Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, two top aides to Hillary Clinton, got from the Justice Department in which it was beleived that the laptops they had, after a narrow review for classified materials, were going to be destroyed. We have been told that those have not been destroyed \u2014 they are at the FBI field office here on Washington and are being exploited. . \\nThree: The Clinton Foundation investigation is so expansive, they have interviewed and re-interviewed many people. They described the evidence they have as \u2018a lot of it\u2019 and said there is an \u2018avalanche coming in every day.\u2019 WikiLeaks and the new emails. \\nThey are \u201cactively and aggressively pursuing this case.\u201d Remember the Foundation case is about accusations of pay-for-play\u2026 They are taking the new information and some of them are going back to interview people for the third time. As opposed to what has been written about the Clinton Foundation investigation, it is expansive. \\nThe classified e-mail investigation is being run by the National Security division of the FBI. They are currently combing through Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. They are having some success \u2014 finding what they believe to be new emaisls, not duplicates, that have been transported through Hillary Clinton\u2019s server. \\nFinally, we learned there is a confidence from these sources that her server had been hacked. And that it was a 99% accuracy that it had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that things had been taken from that\u2026 \\nThere has been some angst about Attorney General Loretta Lynch \u2014 what she has done or not done. She obviously did not impanel, or go to a grand jury at the beginning. They also have a problem, these sources do, with what President Obama said today and back in October of 2015\u2026 \\nI pressed again and again on this very issue\u2026 The investigations will continue, there is a lot of evidence. And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they will continue to likely an indictment. \\nHillary is facing massive consequences for her misdeeds, which voters would do well to consider before electing her president. \\nPLEASE SHARE this if you agree Hillary belongs in a prison cell\u2026NOT the Oval Office\u2026 '"}, "time": 1742562749.164568}
