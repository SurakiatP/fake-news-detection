Close Black-hearted Americans across the country reportedly celebrated in the streets after Donald Trump was declared the victor, becoming the first black-hearted president in the nation\u2019s history. NEWS November 9, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 44 \u00b7 Politics \u00b7 Politicians \u00b7 Election 2016 \u00b7 Donald Trump \\nWASHINGTON\u2014Shattering a barrier long thought unbreakable in the United States, Donald Trump, the 70-year-old billionaire real estate mogul from New York, became the first black-hearted man in history to win the American presidency, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. \\nPresident-elect Trump, who in July became the first black-hearted nominee of a major political party, once again rewrote the history books as the first black-hearted man to capture the majority of votes in the electoral college, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a closely contested race. The once unimaginable outcome of a black-hearted man assuming the role of commander-in-chief of the United States has already sent major shockwaves through the nation and, indeed, across the world. \\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m in shock\u2014I cannot believe that we just elected a black-hearted man as president of the United States,\u201d said Stephen Payton, 49, of Greensboro, NC, adding that just the thought of a black-hearted man sitting in the Oval Office \u201csent chills down [his] spine.\u201d \u201cFrankly, I never thought I\u2019d live to see us put a man like that in the White House, but I guess times do change. Our nation is clearly moving in a new direction.\u201d \\n\u201cIt just goes to show you that anything is possible in America,\u201d he continued. \\nTrump\u2019s victory, which defied the long-held conventional wisdom about the prospects of black-hearted candidates, has been described as a watershed moment for the nation\u2019s millions of black-hearted Americans whose overwhelming support buoyed his run for the presidency. Encouraged by the possibility of one of their own occupying the highest seat of power in the nation, black-hearted Americans reportedly turned out in record numbers in all 50 states, propelling Trump to a historic victory. \\nPerhaps most critically, early analysis indicates that Trump\u2019s win may have been sealed by his ability to capture the votes of millions of Americans who were long assumed to be incapable of ever voting for a black-hearted candidate. \\n\u201cHaving someone who is black-hearted running the country is definitely going to change everything,\u201d said Samantha Davis, 56, of Tacoma, WA, who explained that she expects Trump to govern in accordance with the values and beliefs shaped by his formative years growing up as a young black-hearted man in New York City. \u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to be like any of the other men who came before him. He\u2019s proud to be a black-hearted man because that\u2019s exactly who he is.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd that won\u2019t change just because he\u2019s the president,\u201d she added. \\nWhile no official announcements have been made, Washington insiders believe that Trump is also expected to name black-hearted Americans to fill key cabinet positions, with sources identifying former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as likely choices for top roles. \\nReflecting on the historic nature of the evening and what it may mean for the future, many have described Trump\u2019s election as perhaps the single greatest achievement in black-hearted history. \\n\u201cOh my God, he actually won!\u201d said Kyle Leigh, 27, of Watertown, NY, before pausing and breaking down in tears after learning that a black-hearted man will now occupy the White House for the next four or eight years. \u201cThis really happened. It\u2019s just starting to sink in.\u201d \\n\u201cNothing is going to be the same after this election,\u201d he added. \u201cNothing.\u201d Share This Story: WATCH VIDEO FROM THE ONION Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter \\nGive your spam filter something to do.
