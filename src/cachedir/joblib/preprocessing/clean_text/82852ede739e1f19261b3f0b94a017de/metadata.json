[The College Fix, an online   news source, is reporting that in spite of meeting its original demands, \u201cthe group made three other demands to the university, and it has warned UC Santa Cruz that it has four months to comply with these demands or \u2018more Reclamations will result. \u201d  The three additional demands   is making of UC Santa Cruz have been added to its initial \u201cReclamation Statement,\u201d  and include: A reported by College Fix, this new list of demands contains a deadline and a threat at the end: \u201c  \u2026     that if by Fall Quarter 2017 the university does not provide \u2018detailed plans\u2019 on how to fulfill its new demands, \u2018there will be more Reclamations. \u2019\u201d How did this start? It all started the afternoon of Tuesday, May 2, when approximately   members of   blockaded themselves in Kerr Hall at the university\u2019s Stevenson College. The occupation ended a few days later after UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal met with representatives of   and agreed to meet all the group\u2019s demands, which included: The original occupation was only sparsely reported in the press, possibly because the   took issue with media \u201ctrespassing\u201d in Kerr Hall to cover the student uprising. In spite of largely shunning the press, one   representative did shed some light on the group\u2019s goals in a comment to Fox News: \u201cHaving that red, black and green house in the middle of Stevenson College, which is a predominantly   college, is a matter of symbolism and visibility,\u201d Imari Reynolds of the   told Fox host Tucker Carlson. \u201cBlack students are on this campus. We do exist and we do pay to go here, just like our counterparts and we do deserve to be seen here on this campus. \u201d Why the term \u2018Reclamation\u2019 On the website of the Afrikan Black Coalition, a post titled, \u201cBlack Students at UC Santa Cruz Protest Hostile Campus,\u201d contains a long list of grievances, \u201creparation\u201d demands, and insight into what sparked the recent anger at UC Santa Cruz. The coalition states that studentsare simply taking back what they are owed (original emphasis): The term \u201coccupation\u201d is rejected in favor of \u201creclamation\u201d to describe their actions, claiming: \u201cWe are pushing back against the language of \u2018occupation\u2019 in recognition of the largely   and fairly recent \u2018Occupy Movement.\u2019 We are pushing back against the language of \u2018occupation\u2019 in recognition of the very real settler occupations that are hxstorical [sic] and ongoing, such as the European colonization and occupation of \u2018The Americas,\u2019 as well as the current context of occupation in Palestine. As Black people, there are things that we are owed within the context of reparations and the historical [sic] traumas we have experienced and that we continue to experience today, and we plan to claim and reclaim those things. Under the heading, \u201cWho We Are?\u201d the answer offers additional insight (original emphasis): The   Student Alliance is an    (ABC)   and   organization on the campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz  \u2026    We are the descendants of forcefully enslaved Afrikan people in \u201cThe Americas\u201d as well as the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth generation immigrant and migrant children. We are capitalists,   and Anarchists. We are everything because Blackness is everything. University Response, A spokesman for the university, while declining to discuss whether \u201cthere will be any disciplinary action against the students who forcibly took over Kerr Hall,\u201d did comment to College Fix reporter Matthew Stein \u201cthat \u2018safety\u2019 is the school\u2019s top priority. \u201d There has been no official response to the new demands, which could be quite costly to a university system whose President, former Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano, is under scrutiny of late for allegedly hiding $175 million in a secret \u201cslush fund\u201d while simultaneously raising tuition on students.'"}, "time": 1742563631.7699456}
