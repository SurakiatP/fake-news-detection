It\u2019s box office baby. \\nThe 9/11 memorial was sad, but not as sad as Alvarez will be when I crash land a jumbo left hook in the seemingly structurally sound facade of a face. He will come crashing down. It will be an inside job, because he prepares like a chump. \\nMy focus remains on the battle ahead in Madison Square Gardens but I was thrown off my preparation when I learned there is no garden. It\u2019s just a big fuck off arena forged out of metal for the fighting God. I would say Gods, but there is only one, me, Notorious. \\nI had anticipated doing my movement training with grass beneath my feet, so I headed to Central Park. It ain\u2019t got a patch on Phoenix Park. I wouldn\u2019t be the fighter I am today without Dublin\u2019s back garden. Chasing the deer as a nipper helped me hone my quickness, my agility. \\nI studied the deer and the stag; their movements. So don\u2019t be surprised if I enter the octagon with four hooves and antlers. I will do anything, all it takes to win. Anyway, back to the tour, I hear they filmed some Sex and the City shit in Central Park. \\nNo Sex in the City for Alvarez, though. He couldn\u2019t score in a brothel above Coppers with 20gs in his pocket. What I am saying is that my opponent is challenged in the face department. His head is like a melted lasagne left out in the sun for weeks. Not even Donald Trump would grab him by the pussy. \\nSpeaking of that Fanta headed prick, I\u2019m not in his weight class \u2018cus I\u2019m not obese, but I\u2019ll knock him out all the same. I\u2019ll be worth more than him by the end of 205 too. Where\u2019s my Hollywood star, fuck it, I\u2019ll take the whole Walk. \\nBut, back to the tour \u2013 it would be interesting to note, the actors in Sex in the City are not as rich as me. Chumps. \\nWhen you tour around New York, be warned, people will ask you for endless selfies if you are famous as I am. I love the fans, but obviously when in camp, you\u2019ve got to watch what you\u2019re eating, it can make you a little tetchy, so while reducing my food intake ahead of the weigh in, I like to reduce my selfie intake too. Running from overweight Americans barely counts for cardio, but you\u2019ve gotta take every chance to gain the edge over your opponent. \\nI was told to try the New York pizza, but can\u2019t do that until after my victory, in the mean time I might use it to throw around at the pre-fight press conference. A scalding hot slice slapping Eddie in the face might improve his chances with the ladies. \\nPeace out. I\u2019ve off to chuck a few euro off the top of the Empire State building to let off some steam.'"}, "time": 1742562231.6102316}
