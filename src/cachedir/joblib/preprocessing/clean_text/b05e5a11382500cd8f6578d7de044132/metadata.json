Ryan was in a hotel room in Cincinnati last May when he learned that Donald J. Trump  \u2014   a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves  \u2014   had secured the Republican nomination for president. Mr. Trump had recently lost the Wisconsin primary, which Mr. Ryan and other Republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star\u2019s demise. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas had made strides, and Mr. Ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. But he badly miscalculated. The ensuing path, from Mr. Trump\u2019s securing the nomination to Mr. Ryan\u2019s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in Wisconsin a month before Election Day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that Mr. Trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. Mr. Ryan heard the persistent  \u2014   at times desperate  \u2014   appeals of Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee and a fellow Wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to Mr. Trump. Now, Mr. Ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve Republican control of Congress, yet unable to defend his party\u2019s presidential nominee. If Mr. Trump is defeated on Nov. 8  \u2014   as Mr. Ryan has all but conceded  \u2014   but Republicans maintain their House majority, it will fall largely to Mr. Ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. There is, of course, the question of whether House members would let him do so. The Republicans\u2019 crisis would have an early reckoning with the House decision on whether the speaker should be Mr. Ryan  \u2014   whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been Republican orthodoxy  \u2014   or a new brand of leader who embodies Trumpism. Democrats have moved quickly to paint Mr. Ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of Mr. Trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying Mr. Ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. On Saturday, Mr. Ryan\u2019s office added to that criticism of Mr. Trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee\u2019s talk of a \u201crigged\u201d election. \u201cOur democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. For his part, Mr. Trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of Mr. Ryan. Last week, in a series of Twitter posts, he called Mr. Ryan \u201cour very weak and ineffective leader,\u201d who was lending \u201czero support\u201d and \u201cshould spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee. \u201d For now, the speaker spends his days treating Mr. Trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on Twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. Instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of Hillary Clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered House Republicans. \u201cRight now his objective is crystal clear,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, \u201cto retain the Republican majority in the House. In that effort he has helped members of the Freedom Caucus as well as those in the Tuesday Group and everyone in between,\u201d he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. \u201cWe will worry about our internal differences after the election. Right now we are in a bar fight and every Republican is worth saving. \u201d That Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump were never natural allies is understandable. They had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the White House, an encounter at a   in New York during the 2012 campaign. Mr. Ryan was Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate. Their paths would not cross again. \u201cTrump really wasn\u2019t on Paul\u2019s radar screen,\u201d said A. Mark Neuman, a Ryan friend for two decades. \u201cBefore this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,\u201d he said, noting that Mr. Trump did not share Mr. Ryan\u2019s passions for the Green Bay Packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and Midwest life with children. The relationship showed strains from the start, with Mr. Ryan alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. The speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to Mr. Trump for other Republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. \u201cIf we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that\u2019s not productive,\u201d he said. He made calls to several of the Republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda Mr. Trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (The Trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. Mr. Ryan also declined to be interviewed.) Mr. Ryan had hoped that Mr. Trump would eventually embrace his plan. When Mr. Trump clinched the nomination in May, Mr. Ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. \u201cThe conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, this will end,\u2019\u201d said Charlie Sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in Milwaukee and a friend of Mr. Ryan\u2019s. \u201cSo it was a huge shock. I think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in Wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. \u201d With campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, Mr. Ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse Mr. Trump. None of this pleased Mr. Priebus, who prided himself on building the modern Republican Party in Wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against Mrs. Clinton. In text messages and phone calls, Mr. Priebus tried to persuade Mr. Ryan  \u2014   who was relishing his independence  \u2014   to accept Mr. Trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. Mr. Trump would yell at Mr. Priebus and in turn Mr. Priebus would needle Mr. Ryan. When that did not work, Mr. Trump claimed Mr. Ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to Capitol Hill to try to woo fellow Republicans, a claim Mr. Ryan viewed as a serious breach. \u201cThat was the first realization that Trump wasn\u2019t just a public persona,\u201d said a Republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate Mr. Trump, \u201cbut that his staff does not deal in good faith. \u201d In June, after a period of relative silence on Mr. Trump\u2019s part, Mr. Ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. Staff members of both men began to coordinate for the Republican National Convention. But days later Mr. Ryan aggressively criticized Mr. Trump for his remarks about a Hispanic judge. Another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. \u201cHe was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. A bright spot came in July, when Mr. Trump chose Indiana\u2019s governor, Mike Pence, who has long been close to Mr. Ryan, as his running mate. Privately, Mr. Pence tried to assure skeptical Republicans that he would impose Mr. Ryan\u2019s policy agenda if he and Mr. Trump captured the White House. Then in August, Mr. Trump toyed with endorsing Mr. Ryan\u2019s opponent in a primary. Mr. Ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. He watched Mr. Trump\u2019s acceptance speech from a sky box. Mr. Trump called Mr. Ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of Mr. Pence, and to seek debate advice, which Mr. Ryan said focused on preparation. (Not heeded.) By the fall, Mr. Ryan had basically stopped speaking Mr. Trump\u2019s name. The nominee made a request through the R. N. C. to campaign with Mr. Ryan, whose team agreed to invite Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence to an event this month in Wisconsin. Then came the tape of Mr. Trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. Mr. Sykes let Mr. Priebus know via text that Mr. Trump was no longer welcome in Wisconsin. Mr. Sykes said Mr. Priebus responded: \u201cI am the guy trying to fix this! I am in tears over this. \u2019\u201d (A spokeswoman for Mr. Priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) Mr. Ryan agonized over his options. Ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep Republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. \u201cI think they ask far too much of the speaker,\u201d said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who has renounced Mr. Trump. \u201cHis job is to help House Republicans. Period. \u201d Mr. Ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support Mr. Trump might come after him in the next speaker election. \u201cWe knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. \u201cHow much damage could they do?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564620.5083961}
