[New Trier Township High School is one of the Chicago area\u2019s premier high schools in the tony suburb of Winnetka, a lake shore town north of Chicago. But, along with teaching math, science, English, and history, the school is launching into a major   indoctrination project based on Obama\u2019s agenda of liberal activism.  An expos\u00e9 of the agenda by the Illinois Family Institute shows that \u201cprogressivism\u201d is coming fast and furious at New Trier\u2019s kids. The list of classes and speakers for this new series is being called \u201ca rather bold and raw effort at   propaganda with decidedly          and bigoted biases on display. \u201d Some of the titles of these seminars and workshops are \u201cWhose Civil Rights?: Transpeople of Color Navigating the U. S.,\u201d \u201c21st Century Voter Supression,\u201d \u201cBlackenomics 101 (The Movement, The Music, The Solution),\u201d \u201cMass Incarceration: Race and Prison in America,\u201d and \u201cR. E. A. L.: Race, Equity, and Leadership  \u2014   A Unique Course for High School Students. \u201d Revisionist history is also a major topic of this agenda and will include programs titled, \u201cA People\u2019s History of Chicago\u201d and \u201cWestern Bias in Science. \u201d Even the smallest children will be targeted for Obama\u2019s   project with a program being called, \u201cDeveloping Empathy  Acceptance by Reading Picture Books to Children. \u201d As part of the \u201cBlackenomics 101\u201d program, a special rap song has been written which includes the lyrics, \u201cBlackenomics nigga, Black beat black, nigga\u201d and \u201cDie motherf*cker die. \u201d This agenda, though, is not something isolated to one Chicago school it is part and parcel to a huge program Barack Obama has forced onto schools all across the country. As F. H. Buckley, a professor at Scalia Law School, recently revealed in an   at The New York Post, these sort of extreme,   programs based on a virulently   agenda is part of Obama\u2019s \u201cNew Civics\u201d program imposed on schools that receive federal funding. \u201cMaking Citizens: How American Universities Teach Civics\u201d shows how the Obama DOE has indoctrinated college students through progressive \u201cNew Civics\u201d programs that seek to repurpose higher education away from the study of Western institutions, and even away from scholarship in general, in order to make little   community organizers of our students. The goal of the New Civics movement, concludes the NAS, is to teach students \u201cthat a good citizen is a radical activist,\u201d putting \u201cpolitical activism at the center of everything that students do in college, including academic study,   pursuits, and   ventures. \u201d Instead of a civics education that studies the foundations of American government, New Civics teaches students \u201chow to organize protests, occupy buildings, and stage demonstrations. \u201d Programs like those described above being forced on kids at New Trier are also being programmed into schools all across the nation from the earliest grade school classes to the halls of higher education.
