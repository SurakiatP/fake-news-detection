From an earthenware chalice, he swallowed a capsule of psilocybin, an ingredient found in hallucinogenic mushrooms. Then he put on an eye mask and headphones and lay down on a couch. Soon, images flew by like shooting stars: a spinning world that looked like a   chessboard himself on a stretcher in front of a hospital his parents, gazing at him with aching sadness as he reached out to them, suffused with childlike love. Psilocybin has been illegal in the United States for more than 40 years. But Mr. Mihai, who had just finished treatment for Stage 3 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, was participating in a study looking at whether the drug can reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Throughout that   session, a psychiatrist and a social worker from NYU Langone Medical Center stayed by his side. Published Thursday, the results from that study, and a similar small, controlled trial, were striking. About 80 percent of cancer patients showed clinically significant reductions in both psychological disorders, a response sustained some seven months after the single dose. Side effects were minimal. In both trials, the intensity of the mystical experience described by patients correlated with the degree to which their depression and anxiety decreased. The studies, by researchers at New York University, with 29 patients, and at Johns Hopkins University, with 51, were released concurrently in The Journal of Psychopharmacology. They proceeded after arduous review by regulators and are the largest and most meticulous among a handful of trials to explore the possible therapeutic benefit of psilocybin. Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association, and Dr. Daniel Shalev of the New York State Psychiatric Institute are among leaders in psychiatry, addiction medicine and palliative care who endorsed the work. The studies, they wrote, are \u201ca model for revisiting criminalized compounds of interest in a safe, ethical way. \u201d If research restrictions could be eased, they continued, \u201cthere is much potential for new scientific insights and clinical applications. \u201d Although cancer patients will not have access to therapeutically administered psilocybin anytime soon, the findings add vigor to applications to expand research in a multicenter trial with hundreds of participants. Some medical professionals held the studies at arm\u2019s length. Dr. William Breitbart, chairman of the psychiatry department at Memorial   Cancer Center, questioned this use of cancer patients. \u201cMedical marijuana got its foot in the door by making the appeal that \u2018cancer patients are suffering, they\u2019re near death, so for compassionate purposes, let\u2019s make it available,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re able to extend this drug to other purposes. \u201d Psilocybin trials are underway in the United States and Europe for alcoholism, tobacco addiction and   depression. Other hallucinogens are also being studied for clinical application. This week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a   trial investigating MDMA, the illegal party drug better known as Ecstasy, for   stress disorder.   psychological distress, which afflicts up to 40 percent of patients, can be resistant to conventional therapy. Mr. Mihai\u2019s anxiety began when doctors finally told him he was in remission. He would keep touching the nodules on his neck, where the cancer had announced itself. He flew to Europe to celebrate the end of treatment and his graduation from college, but abruptly returned to New York, terrified to be away from oncologists. He began drinking daily, hard, jeopardizing his fragile health. Alarmed, doctors suggested the psilocybin study. He took the capsule and began tripping. After seeing himself on a hospital stretcher, he recalled: \u201cI had an epiphany. \u201d \u201cWhy are you letting yourself be terrorized by cancer coming back? This is dumb. It\u2019s in your power to get rid of the fear,\u201d he told himself. \u201cThat\u2019s when I saw black smoke rising from my body. And it felt great. \u201d Three years later, Mr. Mihai, now 25 and a physician assistant in Las Vegas, said, \u201cI\u2019m not anxious about cancer anymore. I\u2019m not anxious about dying. \u201d The session, he added, \u201chas made my life richer. \u201d In the 1940s and 1950s, hallucinogens were studied in hundreds of trials. But by 1970, when those drugs were placed in the most restricted regulatory category, research ground to a near halt. Since about 2000, investigators have begun studying them, mostly with private funding. These two studies built on a 2011 UCLA psilocybin pilot project with 12 cancer patients. Both share similarities. All volunteers had diagnoses of   anxiety or depression. Patients were randomly given a placebo or synthetic psilocybin, and not told which. Within seven weeks, they were given the other sample. All patients were educated about the drug, monitored by two people throughout the placebo and psilocybin sessions, and seen for   evaluation. Researchers created   music playlists, paced to the anticipated rhythms of the drug reaction. N. Y. U. leaned toward New Age and world music  \u2014   Brian Eno sitars didgeridoos. Johns Hopkins favored Western classical. At N. Y. U. psychotherapists tried to layer the session into patients\u2019 memories by asking them to write about their visions in a journal and discuss the experience in meetings. The Johns Hopkins study, led by Roland R. Griffiths, a psychopharmacologist, had monitors who urged participants to \u201ctrust, let go and be open. \u201d The N. Y. U. researchers assessed patients the next day and found the effects to be immediate in most of them. Dr. Stephen Ross, the lead investigator and chief of addiction psychiatry at N. Y. U. pointed out that antidepressants, by contrast, can take weeks to show benefit. \u201cCancer patients with anxiety and depression need help immediately,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially if you consider that they are at elevated risk for completed suicide. \u201d Some experts questioned the reliability of the results. Dr. Breitbart said that because diagnoses ranged from   cancer to imminent terminal illness, it was impossible to know which patients might have come through their psychological ordeal without psilocybin  \u2014   whether some might have adapted to the new norms of their disease felt stronger once chemotherapy side effects, including depression, had abated or even experienced an improvement in health. None of those possibilities fit Kevin, who had a   transplant for acute myeloid leukemia. It sent his cancer into remission, but left him with    disease. Suffering from chronic pain and fatigue, Kevin, 57, who lives in central Michigan and asked that his last name be withheld because he had been in law enforcement, had to retire. Four years after the transplant, he despaired. \u201cGoing through a   illness is similar to returning from combat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt damages who you are, to the core of what it is to be human. \u201d \u201cI was hoping to get out of this funk of waiting for the other shoe to drop,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re looking up to the heavens, saying \u2018What else can I try?\u2019 \u201d In 2013, Kevin entered the Johns Hopkins trial. During his session, he saw spirals of iridescent spheres that folded in on themselves. The experience did not restore him to his former life, he said, \u201cbut I have a greater sense of peace of what might come. I\u2019m very grateful, beyond words, for this trial. But you have to approach the session with the right intentions of why you\u2019re doing it. Because you\u2019re going to meet yourself. \u201d Researchers do not know why psilocybin has worked in these settings. Neuroimaging scans of healthy volunteers show areas of the brain lighting up or resting during dosing. Hallucinogens activate a serotonin receptor that can lead to the alterations of consciousness reported routinely. One theory is that psilocybin interrupts the circuitry of   thinking that is so pronounced in depressed people, making way for a mystical experience of selfless unity. The studies received funding from the Heffter Research Institute, an alliance of scientists interested in the medical study of hallucinogens. Dr. George Greer, the   of Heffter, does not see a commercial future for psilocybin, even if it is eventually approved for therapeutic use, because these patients needed only one dose. Instead, he envisions a nonprofit manufacturer, with distribution restricted to specialized clinics. Researchers were emphatic that these results should not be interpreted as condoning hallucinogenic mushrooms for  . Dr. Griffiths noted that patients received extensive support, which may have deepened and secured their   transformations. \u201cPeople will take psilocybin at a rave or at Burning Man\u201d  \u2014   the art and performance desert festival  \u2014   \u201cbut the effect,\u201d he said, \u201cevaporates like water running through their hands. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561879.9333875}
