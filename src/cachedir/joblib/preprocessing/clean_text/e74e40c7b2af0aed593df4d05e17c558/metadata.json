Heroes. Meanwhile the Mexicans are rewarded with citizenship for having babies on our land, illegally. I think we need to change things around a bit, deny citizenship to all Mexicans forever. But first thing\u2019s first, we\u2019re going to build the wall.\u201d \\nTrump even suggested he is considering appointing Snowden and Assange to positions in his cabinet, saying, \u201cThese are smart, smart people. Just look at what they\u2019ve done for us already. Why are we going after them, rather than asking for their help? Think about it. If we spent as much time going after ISIS as we spend on them \u2014 well there wouldn\u2019t have ever been an ISIS. I might hire them. \\n\u201cHillary\u2019s emails were a disaster. Total. Disaster. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to get Snowden be my Cyber General. I\u2019m going to go to war on hackers and secure our computers. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love computers. But ISIS uses computers a lot, and we must be vigilant.\u201d \\n\u201cAssange, he knows so much. So so much. If anyone can help me to drain the swamp, it\u2019s Assange. I think he\u2019d make a great secretary of state.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562174.1873248}
