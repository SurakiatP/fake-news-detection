A competent and purposeful Clinton campaign should have beaten Donald Trump. How did Hillary Clinton and one-percenter Democrats snatch defeat from the jaws of certain victory? America Might Not Deserve Trump, But Dems and Hillary Deserved To Lose by BAR managing editor Bruce A. Dixon \\nIt\u2019s over. The crotch-grabbing racist con man beat the lying corporate warmonger. Donald Trump is president-elect of the US. \\nIt didn\u2019t have to happen that way. Trump\u2019s winning 58 million votes were a hair fewer than Clinton\u2019s popular vote, a million or two less than Republican losers McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012, six and ten million behind Obama\u2019s 2012 and 2008 numbers. The buffoonish Trump was elected with such a low turnout because Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was even less competent and credible. To borrow the condescending language Barack Obama deploys before black audiences, Hillary\u2019s campaign never gave Cousin Pookie much reason to get up off the couch and vote. \\nRepublican and Democratic parties are alike owned by their one-percenter investor/contributors. Democratic party shot callers decided they\u2019d risk losing with Hillary Clinton rather than winning with Bernie Sanders. So Democratic party leadership, their media allies and the entire black political class got behind Hillary Clinton and helped collude and conspire to eliminate VT Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democrat with the best chance against any Republican opponent. \\nOnce Bernie Sanders was eliminated Hillary waged a lazy and ineffective campaign, playing a hand with just three cards. \\nThe first was the broken record of how unthinkable and unprecedented a disaster a Trump presidency would be\u2026 a clownish sexual predator who pronounced climate change a hoax and would criminalize abortion, open concentration camps, repeal Obamacare, legalize stop and frisk, build a wall, appoint neanderthals to the Supreme Court, deport six or ten million immigrants instead of Obama\u2019s paltry two million and who might be in hock to the Russians. Except for the thing about the Russians, it\u2019s roughly the same picture Democrats have drawn of every Republican presidential candidate since Nixon. A story told that many times just gets old. Party leaders counted on it anyway, and it wasn\u2019t enough. That was incompetence. \\nA second and relatively weak card Democrats played was conjuring up an Imaginary Hillary Clinton, a defender of womens\u2019 and human rights who held hands with the moms of killer cop victims, and occasionally mumbled about black lives mattering and the need to reform the criminal justice system. But Hillary\u2019s decades-long record as a tool of banksters, billionaires and one-percenters was so well established in the public mind that Imaginary Hillary was a difficult sell, not credible. \\nThe one-percenter Democrats\u2019 third card, on which they staked a lot was the early and unconditional endorsement of Hillary Clinton by   and Michelle. This had proven effective in Chicago in 2011 and 2015 where Obama\u2019s blessings in 2011 and 2015 were key to fastening Rahm Emanuel on the city\u2019s jugular vein after a half century of Daley rule. The entire black political class got behind Hillary too, from civil rights icons who ruminated on how they hadn\u2019t seen Bernie Sanders back in the day to some other wise heads who assured us a vote for the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka was an act of \u201c narcissism \u201d or maybe white privilege . But at the end of  \u2019s time in office, the Obama endorsement didn\u2019t carry the clout it used to. \\nThanks to two generations of lazy Democrats who refused to try to consolidate the victory of the 1965 Voting Rights Act the Supreme Court in 2013 nullified its key provisions, enabling a constellation of laws and practices aimed at limiting access to the ballot on the part of students, minorities, the elderly and constituencies likely to vote Democratic. In the 2016 election cycle these practices stripped another few million Democratic voters from the rolls. \\nAll in all, Democrats were the authors of their own defeat this presidential election. Hillary couldn\u2019t campaign against the one percent because her party is a party of the one percent. Hillary Democrats including Bernie himself after the convention could no longer acknowledge joblessness, low wages, lack of housing, permanent war or the high cost of medical care or they\u2019d be campaigning against themselves. \\nDonald Trump didn\u2019t win because of some mysterious upsurge of racism and nativism. He won because Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was even less inspiring and less competent than his own, and worked hard to snatch its own defeat from the jaws of victory.
