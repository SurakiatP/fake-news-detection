Merkel previously blamed social media for anti-immigrant sentiment and the rise of the far right. \\n\u201cThe algorithms must be made public, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen on questions like: what influences my behavior on the internet and that of others?\" said Merkel during a media conference in Berlin on Tuesday. \\n\u201cThese algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information.\u201d \\nGoogle uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user, while Facebook arranges the order of the news feed, and decides to include certain posts from a user\u2019s liked pages and friends, at the expense of others. Both sites also promote links to news articles, often based on a user\u2019s own media interests.

No internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings. \\nMerkel did not specifically name Facebook, Google or Twitter, but implied that the large platforms are creating \u201cbubbles\u201d of self-reinforcing views, and squeezing out smaller news providers. \\n\"The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users,\u201d warned Merkel. \u201cThis is a development that we need to pay careful attention to.\u201d \\nThe internet giants themselves have argued that the so-called social media bubble is largely a myth, and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a pre-internet model, where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two TV channels. German establishment raises \u2018Sword of Damocles\u2019 over social media \\nThis is not the first attack on social media by Merkel and her Grand Coalition government, and while the German politician advocates diversity of views, she has previously accused it of perpetrating opinions that are most at odds with those of the establishment and traditional media.

Kauder also called for warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs or before entering pornographic websites, to be given to those about to go on social media.
