S. border officials should not ask incoming visitors  \u2014   including jihadis  \u2014   about their ideological worldview or even ask to check stored images on their cellphones. [\u201cMy hair is on fire about this, I am really upset about this,\u201d said Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. \u201cWe are signaling something that is very   to the rest of the world by announcing this [border] policy,\u201d she told Gen. John Kelly, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.   McCaskill  \u2014   who is up for   in November  \u2014  also complained that the policy would be ineffective at stopping terrorists. \u201cIf they know we\u2019re going to look at their phones, and we know we\u2019re going to ask [ideological questions]   \u2026     they\u2019re going to lie. Are we going to use polygraphs?\u201d \u201cWe could do that for all the people we put into secondary [review],\u201d Kelly responded. \u201cGenerally speaking, the average tourist coming into the United States is not\u201d going to be asked for their phones or be asked questions about their beliefs, Kelly said. McCaskill also suggested that the preferences of foreigners should be considered equal to the preferences of Americans, saying \u201cAmericans would never put up with this in other countries   \u2026     we don\u2019t want to send that signal. \u201d Kelly rejected McCaskill\u2019s complaints, \u201cthis is nothing new  \u2014   we\u2019ve being [asking ideological questions] for a couple of years,\u201d and suggested that officials might use   polygraph tests on some visitors who might lie about their links with jihad groups. For many years, immigration documents, including the   citizenship application form, have required   immigrants to describe their ties with various ideological groups and to explain their personal beliefs.  GOP members of the committee slammed McCaskill. Committee chairman Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson noted that the border officials checked the phones of 26, 000 visiting individuals in 2016, up from less than 1, 000 in 2015. \u201cThis is not new  \u2014   this is being blown somewhat out of proportion,\u201d Johnson said. Only 0. 06 percent of visitors arriving from overseas flights have their phones checked, he said.  Sen. John McCain also pushed back against McCaskill. The stream of news reports showing the Islamic State sending people to launch terrorist attacks in the United States \u201csets my hair on fire,\u201d he said, adding \u201cmaybe we ought to put a little perspective on this hysteria. \u201d GOP Sen. Rand Paul said officials should not be allowed to demand to view the cellphones of returning citizens. \u2018That\u2019s obscene,\u201d he told Kelly, adding that officials probably have the right to exclude people who refuse to have their phones inspected.  Kelly downplayed the particular ideological questions cited by McCaskill, even as he pushed back against her complaints. \u201cWe will go to those questions or request social media [access on cellphones]   \u2026     We\u2019ll be going in that direction when the [DHS] professionals at the [border] counter decide to go in that direction,\u201d he said.  Searching visitors\u2019 cell phones is just like searching visitors\u2019 luggage, Kelly said, adding that most searches of cell phones consist of quick searches through stored photographs and videos. In one recent case, border officials asked a visitor from the Middle East for his phone, which showed contacts with several terrorist organizers, plus images of murdered gays, Kelly said. Border officials asked for his phone because \u201cthere was something not quite right about him,\u201d  he said, adding that \u201cwe sent him back. \u201d In other searches of cellphones, \u201cwe find child pornography, we find really grisly photos of terrorist acts,\u201d he said. In her second round of questions after the criticism from GOP senators, McCaskill partially retreated. \u201cFor some [visitors] maybe we should do polygraphs,\u201d she said, and then changed the subject to other questions, such as rules for checking domestic air travelers\u2019 identification.
