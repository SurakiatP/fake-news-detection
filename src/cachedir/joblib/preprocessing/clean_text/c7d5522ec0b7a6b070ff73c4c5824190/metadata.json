[American journalist Tim Pool has been in Sweden the past week investigating No Go Zones like Malm\u00f6\u2019s infamous Roseng\u00e5rd suburb and various no go areas in the capital, Stockholm. As he was exploring the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby, he claimed masked men approached him and police told him to leave. However, police deny he was escorted out of the area, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.  According to Pool, he wasn\u2019t even filming when several men started following him and his group. He said police also started following him, and when the men put on masks Swedish officers told him to leave the area so as not to cause an incident. Pool released a video on his YouTube channel that shows him speaking with a Swedish photographer in the centre of Rinkeby. The   area was recently plagued by looting and violence, including cars being set on fire, after a local man was arrested by police. The video then cuts to Pool saying police had told him the group needed to leave or up to fifty men could come and drastically escalate the tense situation. The video continues showing a Swedish police van following Pool and his associates away from the shopping centre for several minutes escorting them out of the No Go Zone. The police have fired back against Pool\u2019s claims, saying the increased police presence was due to a \u201cpoetry event\u201d. A spokesman said: \u201cWe had extra police on the ground today and tonight because of the poetry evening in Rinkeby because there will be so many visitors. \u201d The police alleged the reason they told Pool to leave was because he was filming locals and it might cause trouble because people in the area don\u2019t like to be filmed. The shopping area in Rinkeby is where an Australian television crew was attacked last year. The Channel Nine crew had come to the area to investigate the effects of mass migration when they were approached by several men and were punched, kicked, and rammed with a car. Only months later in Husby, another no go   suburb of Stockholm, a Norwegian TV crew was attacked in a cafe while they were interviewing   economist Tino Sandandaji. Mr. Sandandaji recently released a book called Mass Challenge, a \u201csincere and   analysis\u201d of the country\u2019s immigration policy, that was banned by a library in Stockholm for allegedly promoting racism.
