It seems hate of the international whistle-blower Organization doesn\u2019t run in the family. Malik told Obama, via twitter, \u201cbrother please pardon Julian Assange! All he is doing is freeing emails.\u201d\\n@POTUS brother please pardon Julian Assange! All he is doing is freeing emails\\n\u2014 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 26, 2016 \\n\\nSomething that based Obama said himself was that he was for more transparency in government, but that was Obama before he was in office for a few years, that was campaign Obama. Then during his first term he said this about transparency and the truth:\\n\u201cThe only people who don\u2019t want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.\u201d ~Barack Obama\\n\\nThose promises were just that, promises, like every year we get together and pretend voting is going to change something; and listen to candidates feed us bull shit when every year election fraud has been the centralized problem that subverts democracy like the plague.\\nAnd now we have potentially the worst two \u201cchoices\u201d for presidential history; both have a corrupt past. We the American people are being asked to forgive one of these two people: Donald Trump for his potentially corrupt deals with the mafia, or Hillary with her long list of corruption since Arkansas in the 1980s, which has expanded since Wikileaks began leaking John Podesta\u2019s emails, confirming that Donald Trump\u2019s nickname \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d was accurate. Hillary Clinton has cronies in power already; the other, new to politics and a former entertainer and businessman, is Donald Trump. One, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said, if voted in, we are going to war; the other, he said there would be peace.\\nThe emails that wikileaks has been releasing have revealed a multitude of corruption revelations behind both the Clinton Campaign, exposing Hillary Clinton\u2019s character and demeanor itself. Exposing her pay-to-play schemes as Secretary of State, lies to the American public on issues while in secret taking \u201cbig donations\u201d for speeches, the opposite of what she says she supports, and something she calls a \u201cpublic and private opinion\u201d on issues, which most logical people would call lying and deceiving voters.\\nObama, himself, lied for Hillary and said he didn\u2019t know about the private server which Wikileaks has exposed. Obama was sending emails back and forth to Hillary\u2019s email address proving that he did indeed know about the server and that the email she was using wasn\u2019t a state.gov-provided email account.\\nSo Obama\u2019s brother wants him to forget about all that, the Cablegate scandal which, again, Hillary Clinton was apart of, and more? To say the least, Wikileaks and its founding owner Julian Assange have a long rap sheet with the Obama administration. They have crossed paths many times and Malik wants Barack to just forget about it. That\u2019s unlikely but, hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts, right?\\nIn another twist of fate Malik Obama also supports Donald Trump sporting the # Africans4Trump hashtag in his twitter bio, complete with Donald Trump\u2019s signature hashtag #MAGA. He also has a series of tweets that are saying most of what every other normal American, without a President as a brother, is saying, \u201cThis election looks rigged.\u201d That\u2019s right Obama\u2019s brother believes in the dreaded chupacabra election fraud monster that visits every 4 years, just another thing that sets him apart from his brother.\\nHe additionally mocked Hillary\u2019s pay-to-play scandal tweeting the 100K check he was accidentally sent by a mogul in Tehran . I wonder if Malik has seen the Project Veritas videos ?\\nDo not let my brother rig the election @realDonaldTrump \\n\u2014 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 26, 2016 \\nAmerica always lectures Afrika about elections but this election looks rigged! Vote Trump anyway\\n\u2014 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 27, 2016 \\nDo not cheat Colorado or New Hampshire. I will know and I will be mad\\n\u2014 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 27, 2016 \\n\\nObama also hates Trump so are we sure these two are really related? Someone get Maury for a DNA test. Apparently Malik also wonders if they are related sometimes too.\\nWell they are half-brothers so that may explain the chemical imbalance in the force some what..\\nAll I know is that my brother has done nothing for the Kenyan side of his family. I wonder if we are related sometimes.\\n\u2014 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 25, 2016 \\n\\nWikileaks additionally in a nod to Malik, tweeted out \u201cAssange & Kenya\u2019s background\u201d with a link to \u201cThe looting of Kenya under President Moi.\u201d \\nPresident Obama's brother calls for @POTUS to pardon Assange https://t.co/BjtaY2wrJ1 \\nAssange & Kenya, background: https://t.co/BQ8EqCXTqD \\n\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 26, 2016 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nThe post Obama\u2019s Brother Malik Supports Trump AND Wants Obama To Pardon Julian Assange appeared first on We Are Change .\\n\""}, "time": 1742563347.5344825}
