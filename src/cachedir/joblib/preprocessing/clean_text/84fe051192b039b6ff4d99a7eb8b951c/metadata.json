He opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest, and has called for a federal amendment that would allow states to avoid performing or recognizing   marriages. He wants to return to the gold standard, abolish the Internal Revenue Service and create a tax structure simple enough for Americans to file on postcards. He has criticized Donald J. Trump on deportation policy. From the right. Throughout his Senate career, Republican opponents have cast Mr. Cruz as a master of the    \u2014   a \u201cwacko bird,\u201d as Senator John McCain of Arizona once called him  \u2014   whose seemingly reckless pursuits were thought to place him well outside the mainstream. Yet a close reading of Mr. Cruz\u2019s policy prescriptions, influences and writings over two decades, combined with interviews with conservative intellectual leaders and Cruz allies, suggest two powerful truths about the man who might yet assume the mantle of modern conservatism. He would be the most conservative presidential nominee in at least a   perhaps to the right of Barry Goldwater, testing the electoral limits of a personal ideology he has forged meticulously since adolescence. And he has, more effectively than almost any politician of his generation, anticipated the rightward tilt of the Republican Party of today, grasping its conservatism even as colleagues dismissed him as a fringe figure. Now, even Mr. Cruz\u2019s staunchest Republican enemies tend to criticize him most forcefully on tactics  \u2014   lamenting his leading role in the 2013 government shutdown, for instance  \u2014   but not on substance, where they have generally arrived at equivalent positions. \u201cNobody has been more assiduous than Cruz at staying on the same page as the conservative base of the Republican Party,\u201d said Ramesh Ponnuru, a conservative author and senior editor of National Review, who first met Mr. Cruz when they were students at Princeton University. \u201cThat said, it was also the man meeting the moment. He was always a constitutionalist conservative, and then constitutionalism became cool among conservatives. \u201d There have at times been perceptible shifts from Mr. Cruz during the campaign, in both tone and substance, coaxed by the resonance of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist anger and   positions on trade and immigration. But at its core, Mr. Cruz\u2019s brand of conservatism is the product of decades of careful study and manifest intellectual firepower, fusing a host of historical strands into what he has called \u201copportunity conservatism. \u201d As a teenager, growing up in Houston, he earned money delivering speeches on Friedrich A. Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, expounding on   principles at Rotary and Kiwanis clubs. The epigraph for his senior thesis at Princeton, which focused on states\u2019 rights and the Ninth and 10th Amendments, quoted James Madison: \u201cYou must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself. \u201d When he captured the Republican nomination in his 2012 Senate race, Mr. Cruz said he was \u201cwalking in Uncle Milton\u2019s footsteps,\u201d to honor the 100th birthday of the economist Milton Friedman. He is fond of invoking Mr. Reagan\u2019s Cold War dictum (\u201cWe win, they lose\u201d) Margaret Thatcher\u2019s dismissal of socialism (\u201cThe problem with socialism is, eventually you run out of other people\u2019s money\u201d) and even, at times, President John F. Kennedy. \u201cI intend to have in the office of president what J. F. K. used to refer to as \u2018vigaaaahhh\u2019 in defending the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Cruz, now 45, told voters in Iowa in January. Some citations are more familiar to conservative audiences than others. On economic policy, he has at moments turned to Ayn Rand, the libertarian heroine lionized by the right, and John Rawls, the liberal political philosopher who argued for a compact protecting the \u201cleast advantaged. \u201d References to Mr. Rawls have dwindled since Mr. Cruz began his presidential candidacy last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think Rawls   in Iowa,\u201d Mr. Ponnuru joked. It is clear that Mr. Cruz, whose campaign did not make him available for an interview, is most animated by constitutional fights over what he views as overreach by the federal government, particularly on matters of religion. He speaks often of his triumphs as solicitor general of Texas, which included the successful defense of the state\u2019s right to display a Ten Commandments monument at the Capitol. He is a creature of the Supreme Court, counting Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist as a former boss and Justice Antonin Scalia as a friend whose strict constructionist views helped shape his own. And arguing last year against a federal ban on marijuana  \u2014   despite his personal opposition to marijuana legalization at the state level  \u2014   Mr. Cruz recited Justice Louis D. Brandeis\u2019s belief in the states\u2019 role as \u201claboratories of democracy. \u201d Indeed, conservative thinkers have sensed in Mr. Cruz an array of less likely forebears: the   morality of Jimmy Carter or George W. Bush President Obama\u2019s disdain for Beltway   consensus the fictional exploits of Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of \u2018Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\u2019\u201d said Peter D. Feaver, a national security strategist under Mr. Bush and a   professor at Duke University. \u201cThe, \u2018I\u2019m going to pursue this even if everyone else is mad at me because this is right. \u2019\u201d Mr. Cruz seems to take uncommon pride in communicating uncomfortable policy positions to potentially hostile audiences. Mr. Ponnuru likened Mr. Cruz\u2019s opposition to ethanol subsidies in Iowa  \u2014   once considered heretical in a presidential primary  \u2014   to Mr. Goldwater\u2019s unpopular suggestion in 1964, while campaigning in Tennessee, that the Tennessee Valley Authority should be sold. On matters of foreign policy, Mr. Cruz is viewed much more warily by mainstream Republicans. His   career dealt little with international affairs, many say, and his first term has contained some notable shifts. Mr. Cruz entered the Senate in 2013 as part of the Tea Party wave, brandishing a libertarian streak that became more pronounced after revelations of government surveillance tactics, courtesy of Edward J. Snowden. But in the years since, as the national dialogue has grown more consumed by security threats like the Islamic State, Mr. Cruz has recalibrated considerably, leaving an impression among some conservative thinkers that he is merely groping for the median position of the base. Most notable during the campaign has been his pledge to \u201c  ISIS into oblivion,\u201d which has earned a rebuke from military leaders who define the term specifically as the blanket bombing of even civilian areas. Mr. Cruz has argued his iteration can be more targeted. \u201cHe means an overwhelming air campaign,\u201d his longtime national security adviser, Victoria Coates, clarified in an interview. Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center who served under Mr. Reagan and Presidents George Bush and George W. Bush, said Mr. Cruz had been \u201ca little hard to find on the spectrum\u201d of conservative foreign policy. \u201cThe latest incarnation for him is a sort of realist school of overwhelming military force, but he\u2019s constantly criticizing \u201d Mr. Wehner said. \u201cI have a feeling he\u2019s more of an amateur in that area. \u201d The introduction of a national security team last month failed to inspire universal confidence: While the list included some   members of the Reagan and Bush administrations, it also had Frank Gaffney Jr. viewed by many as a fringe conspiracy theorist who has suggested that President Obama is Muslim. \u201cBeing critical of Frank is a cottage industry,\u201d said Ms. Coates, whose own r\u00e9sum\u00e9  \u2014   she is better known as an art historian  \u2014   has been questioned. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, he has been one of the few fearless voices speaking out against the problems of radical Islam. \u201d Other concerns are more semantic. Mr. Cruz has been criticized for appearing to use \u201c \u201d as a pejorative, and for characterizing his foreign policy views as falling \u201csomewhere in between\u201d two polar extremes: the libertarianism of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and the hawkishness of Mr. McCain or Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. He speaks often of   \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d reminding crowds that the largest country Mr. Reagan invaded was Grenada. But some conservative foreign policy experts see a crucial difference, implicit in a February speech outlining his military plans in South Carolina. \u201cCruz\u2019s defense speech was couched as being Reaganite, with plans to increase military spending substantially,\u201d said Gary J. Schmitt, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut the caveat was getting the economy fixed first. Reagan increased defense spending even while deficits soared. \u201d Mr. Wehner worried generally that Mr. Cruz had displayed an \u201cintellectual rigidity\u201d that afforded him little latitude to adapt. Mr. Cruz has long trumpeted his \u201cconsistent conservative\u201d credentials as a strength, proudly recalling his teenage days as part of a team of students who toured event spaces in Texas and wrote out the Constitution on easels. Robert P. George, his mentor and thesis adviser at Princeton, said that he was most struck by \u201cthe consistency from the time when he was a student to now. \u201d Many conservatives cite Madison and Tocqueville, he said, but \u201cTed has actually read them. \u201d Mr. George\u2019s most memorable lesson was in humility. In his book, Mr. Cruz writes of receiving a graded paper from Mr. George, seeing a \u201cC+\u201d on a folded corner of the first page and panicking. \u201cWith white knuckles, I folded the corner over,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand on the front was written, \u2018Just kidding! A. \u2019\u201d Mr. George\u2019s goal was simple. \u201cI thought he should at least have a few moments\u2019 experience,\u201d he said, \u201cof not being the smartest guy in the class. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563122.0668921}
