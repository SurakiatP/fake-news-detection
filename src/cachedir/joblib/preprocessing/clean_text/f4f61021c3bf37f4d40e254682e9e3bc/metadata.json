Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority in the    decision, said such searches do not violate the Fourth Amendment when the warrant is valid and unconnected to the conduct that prompted the stop. Justice Thomas\u2019s opinion drew a fiery dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who said that \u201cit is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of scrutiny. \u201d \u201cThis case tells everyone, white and black, guilty and innocent, that an officer can verify your legal status at any time,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt says that your body is subject to invasion while courts excuse the violation of your rights. It implies that you are not a citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be cataloged. \u201d The case, Utah v. Strieff, No.   arose from police surveillance of a house in South Salt Lake based on an anonymous tip of \u201cnarcotics activity\u201d there. A police officer, Douglas Fackrell, stopped Edward Strieff after he had left the house based on what the state later conceded were insufficient grounds, making the stop unlawful. Officer Fackrell then ran a check and discovered a warrant for a minor traffic violation. He arrested Mr. Strieff, searched him and found a baggie containing methamphetamines and drug paraphernalia. The question for the justices was whether the drugs must be suppressed given the unlawful stop or whether they could be used as evidence given the arrest warrant. \u201cOfficer Fackrell was at most negligent,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote, adding that \u201cthere is no evidence that Officer Fackrell\u2019s illegal stop reflected flagrantly unlawful police misconduct. \u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined the majority opinion. In a dissent that cited W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin and   Coates, Justice Sotomayor said the court had vastly expanded police power. \u201cThe court today holds that the discovery of a warrant for an unpaid parking ticket will forgive a police officer\u2019s violation of your Fourth Amendment rights,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDo not be soothed by the opinion\u2019s technical language: This case allows the police to stop you on the street, demand your identification and check it for outstanding traffic warrants  \u2014   even if you are doing nothing wrong. \u201cIf the officer discovers a warrant for a fine you forgot to pay,\u201d she continued, \u201ccourts will now excuse his illegal stop and will admit into evidence anything he happens to find by searching you after arresting you on the warrant. \u201d Justice Sotomayor added that many people were at risk. Federal and state databases show more than 7. 8 million outstanding warrants, she wrote, \u201cthe vast majority of which appear to be for minor offenses. \u201d There are, she added, 180, 000 misdemeanor warrants in Utah. And according to the Justice Department, about 16, 000 of the 21, 000 residents of Ferguson, Mo. are subject to arrest warrants. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined most of Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissent, along with all of a separate dissent from Justice Elena Kagan. But Justice Sotomayor reserved her most personal reflection for a part of her dissent in which she wrote only for herself, setting out in detail the dangers and indignities that often accompany police stops. \u201cFor generations,\u201d she wrote, \u201cblack and brown parents have given their children \u2018the talk\u2019  \u2014   instructing them never to run down the street always keep your hands where they can be seen do not even think of talking back to a stranger  \u2014   all out of fear of how an officer with a gun will react to them. \u201d \u201cWe must not pretend that the countless people who are routinely targeted by police are \u2018isolated,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey are the canaries in the coal mine whose deaths, civil and literal, warn us that no one can breathe in this atmosphere. They are the ones who recognize that unlawful police stops corrode all our civil liberties and threaten all our lives. Until their voices matter, too, our justice system will continue to be anything but. \u201d Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissent was remarkable. It is, he said, \u201cthe strongest indication we have yet that the Black Lives Matter movement has made a difference at the Supreme Court  \u2014   at least with one justice. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563661.1516705}
