He has referred to the newspaper as \u201cpropaganda\u201d and suggested recently during his weekly radio   show that   New Yorkers would do well to ignore what he called The Post\u2019s \u201cfabricated\u201d   stories. The mayor took his disdain to a new level on Thursday, blatantly and pointedly ignoring the paper\u2019s City Hall bureau chief, Yoav Gonen, during a news conference, and belittling The Post while doing so. The conflict erupted in a petulant exchange, with Mr. Gonen furiously, and futilely, trying to attract the mayor\u2019s attention. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, refused to call on him, explaining that he had \u201cno use for a   rag\u201d while excoriating Mr. Gonen for a recent story he did not write. \u201cMr. Mayor? Mr. Mayor? Mr. Mayor? Over here,\u201d Mr. Gonen said, speaking up in frustration. \u201cYou can keep calling all you want,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cAre you going to call on me today?\u201d Mr. Gonen asked. \u201cI\u2019m calling on real media outlets, go ahead,\u201d the mayor said, signaling a reporter from The New York Observer. It is nothing new for a mayor of New York to view the city\u2019s press corps with contempt. And some powerful public figures, including Donald J. Trump and Raymond W. Kelly, a former New York police commissioner, have gone further, barring reporters from events altogether. But Mr. de Blasio\u2019s very public and dismissive display was extraordinary in the history of antagonism between City Hall and the press. It reflected an escalation of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s longstanding war with the tabloids, which he and some of his closest aides deemed irrelevant early in his tenure. But political operatives said they saw no purpose in the mayor\u2019s lashing out. \u201cI understand his frustration, but unfortunately losing your temper with the news media gets you nothing but stories about losing your temper,\u201d Karen Hinton, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s former press secretary, said. Her advice: Call on the reporter, answer the question, then move on. George Arzt, a political consultant and former press secretary for Mayor Edward I. Koch who was a reporter and City Hall bureau chief for The Post from 1968 to 1986, noted that Mr. Koch\u2019s chief antagonists were investigative reporters from The Village Voice, namely Wayne Barrett and Jack Newfield. The two would never get interviews, Mr. Arzt said, \u201cbut they were allowed to ask questions\u201d during news conferences. \u201cNo one that I\u2019ve seen before this has gone after a paper as an institution,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say everyone on the paper is against me without making them against you. He\u2019s creating his own problem. \u201d Last month, Mr. de Blasio characterized as \u201cfabricated stuff\u201d a   Post article suggesting he had made a   appointment at the behest of a donor who has since pleaded guilty to bribery charges. This month, he refused to answer a question from Mr. Gonen about the background of a contractor hired by the city to train correction officers, adding sarcastically that he did not \u201cappreciate your propagandistic newspaper. \u201d In a telephone interview late Thursday, Mr. de Blasio said it was time to \u201chave this conversation\u201d about The Post, which he described as \u201ca very negative presence in our city\u201d and an \u201cideological apparatus\u201d with little resemblance to a   news operation. \u201cI think it\u2019s important, as the leader of this city, to say out loud what so many people already know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Post\u2019s approach has gotten worse and worse. \u201d He said he had not planned the comments he made at the news conference, adding that he would answer questions from Post reporters in the future, provided they were not \u201cin the middle of playing out one of their propaganda strategies. \u201d The news conference on Thursday included several exchanges in which the mayor appeared exasperated with questions from various reporters about transparency and overlapping investigations into his administration. All the while, he ignored the raised hand of Mr. Gonen. \u201cYou can keep trying, man,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIn the back for the last one. \u201d Mr. Gonen then began to ask his question anyway  \u2014   a request for comment on a report by the Citizens Budget Commission, a fiscal watchdog, about a costly aspect of teachers\u2019 pensions. \u201cYou can talk all you want,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cI\u2019m credentialed just like the other media,\u201d Mr. Gonen said. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, I appreciate solidarity,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said before explaining that his anger stemmed from a Post story on Monday that used the word \u201ccrony\u201d to describe Victor Calise, the commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office for People with Disabilities. \u201cI\u2019ve got no use for a   rag that attacks people who are good public servants and tries to undermine their reputation,\u201d he said, pointing to Mr. Calise who was seated nearby. \u201cI\u2019m not playing that game. \u201d The   of Friday\u2019s Post, published online Thursday night, embraced the clash with glee. \u201cDe Waaasio,\u201d read the headline above a   of the mayor\u2019s head on a baby\u2019s body in a highchair. \u201cAww, did we hurt your feelings?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561792.718116}
