I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor. \\nWhen I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\\nSo we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. ( source )\\nBut, now that victory has set in, and the election is officially over, can anybody expect that he will actually do it?\\nCertainly, we must wait until he is inaugurated and has a chance to show what kind of president he will be.\\nHowever, Trump\u2019s victory speech gives good reason to doubt the prospects for his actually assigning a \u201cspecial prosecutor\u201d against Hillary Clinton.\\nHe opened the speech with praise for Clinton and a call for unity \u2013 certainly a different chord for now-president-elect Trump:\\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) She congratulated us \u2014 it\u2019s about us \u2014 on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she \u2014 she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. \\n(APPLAUSE) I mean that very sincerely. (APPLAUSE)\\nNow it\u2019s time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\\n\\nCertainly, there is something to be said for being a gracious winner \u2013 and for Trump, proving to his critics that he won\u2019t be their worst nightmare.\\nBut what really accounts for the shift in tone?\\nLate in the evening, John Podesta \u2013 top aide to Hillary, thoroughly implicated in wickedness by Wikileaks \u2013 announced, in essence, that the campaign would not concede, that they would wait until every last vote was counted.\\nClearly, Team Hillary was fully prepared to challenge a recount, to take it to court in every venue possible. Al Gore did so (and with good cause), and she could too.\\nHillary and her campaign had every opportunity to deny Trump easy victory, even when there was no real chance left for her.\\nAnd yet, shortly after Podesta\u2019s announcement, Trump gave his victory speech, noting a call from Hillary Clinton herself in which she conceded \u2013 but on what terms?\\nThough it is admittedly speculative \u2013 can anyone else claim to know what was said during that call? \u2013 it is entirely possible that the primary demand for her swift admission of defeat was that any and all possibility of prosecution and investigation for her sordid and illegal activities be taken off the table.\\nDid Hillary make THAT call? Did Trump essentially grant her immunity from his own special court in exchange for the win he otherwise already earned?\\nOnly time will tell.\\nBut it STILL seems that Hillary knows something that we all do not \u2013 because she has said all along that it is not going to happen\u2026 that there isn\u2019t even the slightest chance:\\nHillary Clinton: Criminal Indictment \u201cNot Going to Happen\u201d\\n\\nHILLARY CLINTON INDICTMENT FURY \u2013 Hillary Claims Indictment \u201cNot Gonna Happen\u201d\\n\\nSo, is she right about that?\\nWhat will Trump do in the first 100 days?\\nDon\u2019t be surprised if campaign rhetoric ends up being just all talk. For Trump supporters who were, above all, opposing Hillary Clinton and urging her being prosecuted and held accountable \u2013 don\u2019t hold your breath.\\nRead more: \\nTrump Calls Out Hillary at Debate: \u201cYou Should Be in Jail\u2026 I\u2019ll Call A Special Prosecutor\u201d \\n5 Wikileaks Revelations That Should\u2019ve Tanked Hillary\u2019s Campaign \\nWhere Are The Handcuffs?
