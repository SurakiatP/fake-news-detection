{"duration": 0.5414879322052002, "input_args": {"text": "'By: Charles Seife, Scientific American | The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has been arm-twisting journalists into relinquishing their reportorial independence, our investigation reveals. Other institutions are following suit. It was a faustian bargain\u2014and it certainly made editors at National Public Radio squirm. The deal was this: NPR, along with a select group of media outlets, would get a briefing about an upcoming announcement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration a day before anyone else. But in exchange for the scoop, NPR would have to abandon its reportorial independence. The FDA would dictate whom NPR\u2019s reporter could and couldn\u2019t interview. \u201cMy editors are uncomfortable with the condition that we cannot seek reaction,\u201d NPR reporter Rob Stein wrote back to the government officials offering the deal. Stein asked for a little bit of leeway to do some independent reporting but was turned down flat. Take the deal or leave it. NPR took the deal. \u201cI\u2019ll be at the briefing,\u201d Stein wrote. Later that day in April 2014, Stein\u2014along with reporters from more than a dozen other top-tier media organizations, including CBS, NBC, CNN, the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times \u2014showed up at a federal building to get his reward. Every single journalist present had agreed not to ask any questions of sources not approved by the government until given the go-ahead. \u201cI think embargoes that attempt to control sourcing are dangerous because they limit the role of the reporter whose job it is to do a full look at a subject,\u201d says New York Times former public editor Margaret Sullivan. \u201cIt\u2019s really inappropriate for a source to be telling a journalist whom he or she can and can\u2019t talk to.\u201d Ivan Oransky, distinguished writer in residence at New York University\u2019s Journalism Institute and founder of the Embargo Watch weblog, agrees: \u201cI think it\u2019s deeply wrong.\u201d This kind of deal offered by the FDA\u2014known as a close-hold embargo\u2014is an increasingly important tool used by scientific and government agencies to control the behavior of the science press. Or so it seems. It is impossible to tell for sure because it is happening almost entirely behind the scenes. We only know about the FDA deal because of a wayward sentence inserted by an editor at the New York Times . But for that breach of secrecy, nobody outside the small clique of government officials and trusted reporters would have known that the journalists covering the agency had given up their right to do independent reporting. Documents obtained by Scientific American through Freedom of Information Act requests now paint a disturbing picture of the tactics that are used to control the science press. For example, the FDA assures the public that it is committed to transparency, but the documents show that, privately, the agency denies many reporters access\u2014including ones from major outlets such as Fox News\u2014and even deceives them with half-truths to handicap them in their pursuit of a story. At the same time, the FDA cultivates a coterie of journalists whom it keeps in line with threats. And the agency has made it a practice to demand total control over whom reporters can and can\u2019t talk to until after the news has broken, deaf to protests by journalistic associations and media ethicists and in violation of its own written policies. By using close-hold embargoes and other methods, the FDA, like other sources of scientific information, are gaining control of journalists who are supposed to keep an eye on those institutions. The watchdogs are being turned into lapdogs. \u201cJournalists have ceded the power to the scientific establishment,\u201d says Vincent Kiernan, a science journalist and dean at George Mason University. \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting and somewhat inexplicable, knowing journalists in general as being people who don\u2019t like ceding power.\u201d The press corps is primed for manipulation by a convention that goes back decades: the embargo. The embargo is a back-room deal between journalists and the people they cover\u2014their sources. A source grants the journalist access on condition that he or she cannot publish before an agreed-on date and time. A surprisingly large proportion of science and health stories are the product of embargoes. Most of the major science journals offer reporters advance copies of upcoming articles\u2014and the contact information of the authors\u2014in return for agreeing not to run with the story until the embargo expires. These embargoes set the weekly rhythm of science coverage: On Monday afternoon, you may see a bunch of stories about the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA published almost simultaneously. Tuesday, it\u2019s the Journal of the American Medical Association . On Wednesday, it\u2019s Nature and the New England Journal of Medicine. Science stories appear on Thursday. Other institutions have also adopted the embargo system. Federal institutions, especially the ones science and health journalists report on, have as well. Embargoes are the reason that stories about the National Laboratories, the National Institutes of Health and other organizations often tend to break at the precisely same time. Embargoes were first embraced by science reporters in the 1920s, in part because they take the pressure off. After all, when everybody agrees to publish their stories simultaneously, a reporter can spend extra time researching and writing a story without fear of being scooped. \u201c[Embargoes] were created at the behest of journalists,\u201d says Kiernan, who has written a book, Embargoed Science , about scientific embargoes. \u201cScientists had to be convinced to go along.\u201d But scientific institutions soon realized that embargoes could be used to manipulate the timing and, to a lesser extent, the nature of press coverage. The result is a system whereby scientific institutions increasingly control the press corps. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten the upper hand in this relationship, and journalists have never taken it back,\u201d Kiernan says. The embargo system is such an established institution in science journalism that few reporters complain or even think about its darker implications, at least until they themselves feel slighted. This January the California Institute of Technology was sitting on a great story: researchers there had evidence of a new giant planet\u2014Planet Nine\u2014in the outer reaches of our solar system. The Caltech press office decided to give only a dozen reporters, including Scientific American \u2018s Michael Lemonick, early access to the scientists and their study. When the news broke, the rest of the scientific journalism community was left scrambling. \u201cApart from the chosen 12, those working to news deadlines were denied the opportunity to speak to the researchers, obtain independent viewpoints or have time to properly digest the published research paper,\u201d complained BBC reporter Pallab Ghosh about Caltech\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d favoritism in an open letter to the World Federation of Science Journalists. When asked about why Caltech chose to release the news only to a select group of reporters, Farnaz Khadem, Caltech\u2019s head of communications, stated that she is committed to being \u201cfair and transparent\u201d about how and when Caltech shares news with journalists. She then refused to talk about the Planet Nine incident or embargoes or press strategy, and she would not grant access to anyone at Caltech who might talk about such matters. As a consequence, it is hard to know for certain why Caltech decided to share the news with only a select group of reporters. But it is not hard to guess why journalists such as Ghosh were excluded. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that they were not good enough or not liked enough,\u201d Kiernan speculates. \u201cThere was a real effort here to control things, making sure that the elite of the elite covered this story and covered it in a certain way, which would then shape the coverage of all other journalists. It\u2019s very clearly a control effort.\u201d Caltech is not the only institution that steers coverage by briefing a very small subset of reporters. (As I was writing this piece, I received a note from a U.S. Air Force press officer offering a sneak preview of video footage being offered to \u201ca select number of digital publications.\u201d) For years the FDA has been cultivating a small group of journalists who are entrusted with advance notice of certain events while others are left out in the cold. But it was not the game of favorites that ignited a minor firestorm in the journalism community in January 2011\u2014it was the introduction of the close-hold embargo. Like a regular embargo, a close-hold embargo allows early access to information provided that attendees not publish before a set date and time. In this case, it was a sneak peek at rules about to be published regarding medical devices. But there was an additional condition: reporters were expressly forbidden from seeking outside comment. Journalists would have to give up any semblance of being able to do independent reporting on the matter before the embargo expired. Even reporters who had been dealing with the FDA for years were incredulous. When one asked the agency\u2019s press office if it really was forbidding communications with outside sources, Karen Riley, an official at the FDA, erased all doubt. \u201cIt goes without saying that the embargo means YOU CANNOT call around and get comment ahead of the 1 P.M. embargo,\u201d she said in an e-mail. \u201cActually it does need some saying, since this is a new version of a journalistic embargo,\u201d wrote Oransky in his Embargo Watch blog. Without the ability to contact independent sources, he continued, \u201cjournalists become stenographers.\u201d Kiernan echoes the sentiment: \u201c[When] you can\u2019t verify the information, you can\u2019t get comment on the information. You have to just keep it among this group of people that I told you about, and you can\u2019t use it elsewhere. In that situation, the journalist is allowing his or her reporting hands to be tied in a way that they\u2019re not going to be anything, ultimately, other than a stenographer.\u201d The Association of Health Care Journalists (AHCJ), of which I am a member, publicly objected to the close-hold embargo, noting that it \u201cwill be a serious obstacle to good journalism. Reporters who want to be competitive on a story will essentially have to agree to write only what the FDA wants to tell the world, without analysis or outside commentary.\u201d Faced by this opposition, the agency quickly backtracked. After a meeting with AHCJ leaders, Meghan Scott, then the agency\u2019s acting associate commissioner for external affairs, wrote: \u201cPrior to your inquiry, the FDA did not have a formal news embargo policy in place.\u201d The FDA was now establishing new ground rules that \u201cwill better serve the media and the public.\u201d Initially published online in June 2011, the FDA\u2019s new media policy officially killed the close-hold embargo: \u201cA journalist may share embargoed material provided by the FDA with nonjournalists or third parties to obtain quotes or opinions prior to an embargo lift provided that the reporter secures agreement from the third party to uphold the embargo.\u201d Due diligence would always be allowed, at least at the FDA. Health and science journalists breathed a sigh of relief. The AHCJ expressed gratitude that the FDA had changed its tune, and Oransky\u2019s Embargo Watch congratulated the agency for backing down: \u201cFor doing the right thing, the FDA has earned a spot on the Embargo Watch Honor Roll. Kudos.\u201d And the FDA had cleared up the misunderstanding and affirmed that it was committed to \u201ca culture of openness in its interaction with the news media and the public.\u201d In reality, there was no misunderstanding. The close-hold embargo had become part of the agency\u2019s media strategy. It was here to stay\u2014policy or no policy. It is hard to tell when a close-hold embargo is afoot because, by its very nature, it is a secret that neither the reporters who have been given special access nor the scientific institution that sets up the deal wants to be revealed. The public hears about it only when a journalist chooses to reveal the information. We have a few rare instances where journalists revealed that close-hold embargoes were being used by scientists and scientific institutions after 2011. In 2012 biologist Gilles-Eric S\u00e9ralini and his colleagues published a dubious\u2014later retracted and then republished\u2014paper purportedly linking genetically modified foods to cancer in rats. They gave reporters early access under a close-hold embargo, quite likely to hamstring the reporters\u2019 ability to explore gaping holes in the article, a situation science journalist Carl Zimmer described as \u201ca rancid, corrupt way to report about science.\u201d In 2014 the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (also called the CSB) released a report to journalists under a close-hold embargo. When challenged, the then managing director of the CSB, Daniel Horowitz, told Oransky\u2019s Embargo Watch that the close-hold embargo was used \u201con the theory that this would provide a more orderly process.\u201d He then stated that the board was going to \u201cdrop the policy in its entirety for future reports.\u201d Privately, however, a CSB public affairs specialist noted in an e-mail, \u201cFrankly, I wish we did have more stenographers out there. Government agencies trying to control the information flow is an old story, but the other side of the story is that government agencies that do good work often have a difficult time getting their story told in an era of journalistic skepticism and partisan bickering and bureaucratic infighting.\u201d Also in 2014 the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) used a close-hold embargo when it announced to a dozen reporters that researchers had discovered subtle signals of gravitational waves from the early universe. \u201cYou could only talk to other scientists who had seen the papers already; we didn\u2019t want them shared unduly,\u201d says Christine Pulliam, the media relations manager for CfA. Unfortunately, the list of approved scientists provided by CfA listed only theoreticians, not experimentalists\u2014and only an experimentalist was likely to see the flaw that doomed the study. (The team was seeing the signature of cosmic dust, not gravitational waves.) \u201cI felt like a fool, in retrospect,\u201d says Lemonick, who, as one of a dozen or so chosen journalists, covered the story for Time (at the time, he was not on the staff of Scientific American ). The FDA, too, quietly held close-hold embargoed briefings, even though its official media policy forbids it. Without a source willing to talk, it is impossible to tell for sure when or why FDA started violating its own rules. A document from January 2014, however, describes the FDA\u2019s strategy for getting media coverage of the launch of a new public health ad campaign. It lays out a plan for the agency to host a \u201cmedia briefing for select, top-tier reporters who will have a major influence on coverage and public opinion of the campaigns.\u2026 Media who attend the briefing will be instructed that there is a strict, close-hold embargo that does not allow for contact with those outside of the FDA for comment on the campaign.\u201d Why? The document gives a glimpse: \u201cMedia coverage of the campaign is guaranteed; however, we want to ensure outlets provide quality coverage of the launch,\u201d the document explains. \u201cThe media briefing will give us an opportunity to shape the news stories, conduct embargoed interviews with the major outlets ahead of the launch and give media outlets opportunities to prepare more in-depth coverage of the campaign launch.\u201d Ten reporters\u2014from the New York Times , the Washington Post, USA Today , the Associated Press, Reuters, ABC, NBC, CNN and NPR\u2014were invited to have their stories shaped. The day after the briefing, on February 4, everybody\u2014except for the New York Times \u2014ran with stories about the ad campaign. Independent comment was notably missing. Only NPR, which went live hours after the others, and CNN, in an update to its story midday, managed to get any reaction from anyone outside of the FDA. CBS plunked down an out-of-context quotation from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, probably in hopes that readers wouldn\u2019t notice that it was two months old. Nobody else seems to have tried to get anyone who could critique the ad campaign. The result was a set of stories almost uniformly cleaving to the FDA\u2019s party line, without a hint of a question about whether the ad campaign would be as ineffective as many other such campaigns. Not one of the media outlets said anything about the close-hold embargo. From the agency\u2019s point of view, it was mission accomplished. The FDA had a much harder task two months later. The agency was about to make public controversial new rules about electronic cigarettes. It was nearly impossible to keep the story from leaking out ahead of time; days before the new rules were going to be published in April 2014, rumors were flying. Reporters around the country could smell the story and began to e-mail the FDA\u2019s press office with questions about the e-cigarette rules. The agency flacks would have to use all the powers at their disposal to control the flow of information. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a number of rumors that the FDA will be releasing its proposed e-cigarette regulations on Monday,\u201d Clara Ritger, then a reporter with the National Journal asked on Friday, April 18. \u201cI wanted to see if I could confirm that? If that\u2019s not accurate, do you have a timeline?\u201d Stephanie Yao, then an FDA press officer, dodged the question: \u201cThe proposal is still in draft form and under review. As a matter of policy, the FDA does not share draft rules with outside groups while a rule is still under review.\u201d The fencing match was on. \u201cThank you for following up with the statement,\u201d Ritger responded. \u201cWhile I know the proposal is still in draft form and under review, for my planning purposes I wanted to find out when the proposed regulations will be coming out?\u201d \u201cHave you subscribed to FDA press announcements?\u201d Jenny Haliski, then another FDA press officer, wrote back on Monday. \u201cThe proposed rule itself will be published in the Federal Register.\u201d \u201cThanks for sending! I signed up,\u201d Ritger responded. \u201cThe only other question I had was when the proposed regulations would come out, off the record, for planning purposes?\u201d Not even an offer of being off the record could get the agency to spill the beans. \u201cThe FDA can\u2019t speculate on the timing of the proposed rule,\u201d Haliski replied. But this was a carefully crafted half-truth. There was no need to speculate. Haliski and others in the press office knew quite well not just that the rule was going to be published on Thursday, April 24, but also that there was going to be a close-hold embargoed briefing on Wednesday. It\u2019s just that Ritger and the National Journal weren\u2019t invited. The invite list had been drafted days earlier, and, as usual, the briefing was limited to trusted journalists: the same outlets from the ad campaign briefing in February, with the addition of a few more, which included the Wall Street Journal , the Boston Globe , the Los Angeles Times , Bloomberg News, Politico and the Congressional Quarterly . At the very same moment that the agency was discussing the embargoed briefing with some of their chosen reporters, anyone outside that small circle, like Ritger, was being thrown off the trail. Not even Fox News was allowed in. Some within the FDA press office wondered why Fox was excluded, unlike the other major networks. \u201cBTW, we noticed that Fox still wasn\u2019t on the invite list,\u201d Raquel Ortiz, then an FDA press officer, told Haliski. \u201cI have no national Fox reporter who had contacted me on this topic,\u201d Haliski responded. \u201cAll reporters invited to the briefing needed to have covered tobacco regulatory issues before.\u201d Ortiz realized that this wasn\u2019t an honest answer: \u201cBut they definitely cover FDA/CTP [Center for Tobacco Products] and tobacco stories\u2014[a colleague has] seen them.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have a good contact for Fox,\u201d Haliski insisted, rather lamely. A contact would not have been hard to find had they bothered to look. And, as chance would have it, the contact found them. Early the next morning, with plenty of time before the briefing, Fox\u2019s senior national correspondent\u2014John Roberts, one-time heir apparent to Dan Rather\u2014contacted Haliski asking for access. \u201cI\u2019m aware that the FDA will likely come out with its deeming rule regarding e-cigarettes in the next week or so. I\u2019d like to have a story ready to go for the day (holding to any embargo),\u201d he wrote. \u201cCan we make that happen?\u201d \u201cHi, John, Have you subscribed to FDA press announcements?\u201d Access denied. \u201cI was particularly troubled by it because I was the medical correspondent for CBS Evening News for a couple of years, and I had a very good relationship with the FDA and everybody there,\u201d says Roberts, who found out he was excluded after the other correspondents\u2019 stories came out. \u201cI was told by these folks that Fox news wasn\u2019t invited because of \u2018past experiences with Fox.\u2019\u201d A little after noon on Wednesday, April 23, the briefing went on as scheduled. All the reporters present understood the terms, as announced: \u201cAs discussed, under this embargo you will not be able to reach out to third parties for comment on this announcement. We are providing you with a preview of the information with this understanding.\u201d But by 2:30 P.M., the close-hold embargo was already fraying at the edges. FDA officials apparently got wind that a reporter was trying to talk to a member of Congress about the new rules. Even though it was not clear that this was a breach of the embargo\u2014the interview was scheduled for after the embargo expired, and the reporter presumably did not share any crucial information ahead of time\u2014it was bending the close-hold rules, and the FDA was livid. Within half an hour, FDA\u2019s Jefferson had fired off an angry e-mail to the close-hold journalists. \u201cIt has been brought to our attention that there has already been a break in the embargo\u2026. Third-party outreach of any kind was and is not permitted for this announcement. Everyone who participated agreed to this,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMoving forward, we will no longer consider embargoed briefings for news media if reporters are not willing to abide by the terms an embargo\u2026. We take this matter very seriously, and as a consequence any individuals who violated the embargo will be excluded from future embargoed briefings with the agency.\u201d Violate the rules, even in spirit, and you\u2019ll be left out in the cold with the rest. The denials flew in. \u201cThis is very frustrating as someone who has consistently played by the rules and has covered CTP/FDA for years to be lumped in with a group of reporters that cannot respect your requests not to reach out to third parties,\u201d insisted then AP reporter Michael Felberbaum. \u201cI have of course always advocated that you work more closely with reporters like myself who clearly understand and cover this area consistently instead of reporters who are just assigned to handle on a whim.\u201d But despite the scare about a breach, the secrecy held. When the embargo expired and the early news stories went online, the FDA had little to complain about; the embargo had worked once again to shape coverage. Felberbaum\u2019s piece, for example, quoted Margaret Hamburg, then head of the FDA, and Mitch Zeller, the head of the agency\u2019s CTP, but nobody else. Even after he updated his piece later in the day to get some outside comments, there was little hint of how controversial the new rules were. Members of the tobacco industry were generally unhappy with increased federal regulation of their business, while antitobacco advocates tended to argue that the new regulations were far too weak and took way too long to promulgate. And there was no mention, in Felberbaum\u2019s article, at least, that the agency had tried to regulate e-cigarettes several years earlier but was slapped down with a stinging rebuke from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (When asked about his work for the AP, Felberbaum\u2014who has since quit his job as a reporter to become an FDA press officer\u2014said, \u201cI\u2019m not really sure whether I\u2019m comfortable discussing that at this point.\u201d) Some of the other outlets, like NPR, injected a little more nuance into their pieces, despite the restrictions, by doing additional reporting after the embargo expired. (In a statement, NPR said that agreeing to the FDA\u2019s conditions was not a violation of ethics guidelines and \u201cin no way influenced which other voices or ideas were included in the coverage.\u201d) Still, even those pieces did not stray far from the key messages that the agency wanted to get across. Again the FDA found little to complain about. Except for one little thing. Of all the media outlets, the New York Times was the only one to mention the close-hold embargo: \u201cFDA officials gave journalists an outline of the new rules on Wednesday but required that they not talk to industry or public health groups until after Thursday\u2019s formal release of the document.\u201d (\u201cI felt like I wanted to be clear with readers,\u201d Sabrina Tavernise, the author of the story, later told Sullivan, the New York Times \u2018 public editor at the time. \u201cUsually you would have reaction in a story like this, but in this case, there wasn\u2019t going to be any.\u201d) The FDA was not pleased that the omert\u00e0 had been broken. \u201cI have to say while I generally reserve my editorial comments, I was a little surprised by the tone of your article and the swipe you took at the embargo in the paper\u2014when after combing through the coverage no one else felt the need to do so in quite that way,\u201d the FDA\u2019s Jefferson upbraided Tavernise in an e-mail. \u201cTo be clear, this is me taking stuff personally when I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I thought we had a better working relationship than this\u2026. I never expect totally positive coverage as our policies are controversial and complex, but at least more neutral and slightly less editorialized. Simply put, bummer. Off to deal with a pissed Fox News reporter.\u201d Tavernise promptly apologized. \u201cGeez, sorry about the embargo thing. Editors were asking why we didn\u2019t get to see it so I was asked to put a line in to explain,\u201d she wrote. (Tavernise declined to comment for this article; Celia Dugger, one of the New York Times editors who handled the piece, said via e-mail: \u201cAs to the decision to describe the conditions of the embargo in the story, Sabrina and I talked it over and agreed it was best to include them.\u201d) The FDA was not pleased that the secret of the close-hold embargo was out, and the excluded press was confused and angry. \u201cIn this particular instance, it struck me as very strange,\u201d says Fox\u2019s Roberts. \u201cIt was a government agency picking and choosing who it was going to talk to on a matter of public policy, and then the fact that I had a longstanding relationship with the FDA that, with this new administration, didn\u2019t seem to matter.\u201d Oransky complained again on Embargo Watch about the FDA\u2019s attempts to turn journalists \u201cinto stenographers.\u201d Sullivan asked a few pointed questions of Jefferson, who, in Sullivan\u2019s words, insisted that the FDA\u2019s intent was \u201cnot to be manipulative but to give reporters early access to a complicated news development\u201d and noted, in passing, that Tavernise had not objected to the terms of the close-hold embargo. But the damage was short-lived. Very little came of the complaints; Sullivan said that she would \u201clike to see the Times push back\u2014hard\u2014against such restrictions in every instance and be prepared to walk away from the story if need be,\u201d but there is no evidence of any substantial pushback by anyone. The two-tiered system of outsiders and insiders that undergirds the close-hold policy is also still enforced. Major press outlets such as Scientific American and Agence France-Presse have written to the FDA to complain about being excluded but have not received any satisfaction from the agency. Months after the e-cigarette affair and following a different FDA story about food labeling that insiders had early access to, Time magazine complained about its lack of access to a select-press-only phone call. \u201c Time was not included \u2026 (they weren\u2019t even on my radar to be honest with you), but we handled all their queries\u201d the day after the call, then FDA press officer Jennifer Corbett Dooren wrote. Absent any indications from the agency, it is anyone\u2019s guess whether the close-hold embargo is still in use at the FDA and, if so, how frequently. Unfortunately, the FDA refused to answer any questions. Because I am suing the agency for access to documents about embargo practices at the FDA, the press office, in a statement that failed to answer any specific questions, said that news embargoes \u201callow reporters time to develop their articles on complex matters in an informed, accurate way\u201d and that its use of embargoes conforms to relevant government guidelines and best practices. The press office referred all questions to the FDA\u2019s Office of the Chief Counsel, which did not supply answers. Since the New York Times slip, no journalist covering the agency has openly mentioned being subject to such restrictions. Scientific American made a significant effort to contact many of the reporters believed to have agreed to an FDA close-hold embargo\u2014including the AP\u2019s Felberbaum, the Times \u2018 Tavernise, NPR\u2019s Stein, and other reporters from Reuters, USA Today and the LA Times . None could shed any light on the issue. Some explicitly refused to speak to Scientific American ; some failed to return queries; two had no recollection of having ever agreed to a close-hold embargo, including Tom Burton, a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning Wall Street Journal reporter and the only one willing to answer questions. \u201cI didn\u2019t remember it at all, and [even] after you told me, I didn\u2019t remember,\u201d he said. As far as he knows, Burton added, such embargoes are rare. No matter how rare it might be, there is documentary evidence of its happening multiple times, and each instance since 2011 is a violation of the FDA\u2019s official media policy, which explicitly bans close-hold embargoes. This policy still stands, just as it did before the last close-hold embargo. The smart money says that the agency\u2019s unofficial policy still stands, too\u2014and the favoritism and close-hold embargoes continue. It is apparently too sweet an arrangement for the FDA simply to walk away. Despite the difficulty of measuring the use of close-hold embargoes, Oransky and Kiernan and other embargo observers agree that they\u2014and other variations of the embargo used to tighten control over the press\u2014appear to be on the rise. And they have been cropping up in other fields of journalism, such as business journalism as well. \u201cMore and more sources, including government sources but also corporate sources, are interested in controlling the message, and this is one of the ways they\u2019re trying to do it,\u201d says the New York Times \u2018 Sullivan. \u201cI think it should be resisted.\u201d As much blame as government and other institutions bear for attempting to control the press through such means, the primary responsibility lies with the journalists themselves. Even a close-hold embargo wouldn\u2019t constrain a reporter without the reporter\u2019s consent; the reporter can simply wait until the embargo expires and speak to outside sources, albeit at the cost of filing the story a little bit later. Says Oransky: \u201cWe as journalists need to look inward a little bit and think about why all of us feel we absolutely have to publish something at embargo [expiration] when we don\u2019t think we have the whole story?\u201d Alas, Kiernan says, there isn\u2019t any movement within the journalism community to change things: \u201cI don\u2019t know that journalists in general have taken a step back, [looking] from the 50,000-foot view to understand how their work is controlled and shaped by the embargo system.
