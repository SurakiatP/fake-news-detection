Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/soros-paid-al-gore-millions-to-push.html Liberal billionaire George Soros gave former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s environmental group millions of dollars over three years to create a \u201cpolitical space for aggressive U.S. action\u201d on global warming, according to leaked documents. A document published by DC Leaks shows Soros, a Hungarian-born liberal financier, wanted his nonprofit Open Society Institute (OSI) to do more to support global warming policies in the U.S. That included budgeting $10 million in annual support to Gore\u2019s climate group over three years.\u201cU.S. Programs Global Warming Grants U.S. Programs became engaged on the global warming issue about four years ago, at George Soros\u2019s suggestion,\u201d reads a leaked OSI memo.\u201cThere has been a budget of $11 million for global warming grants in the U.S. Programs budget for the last several years,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cThis budget item captures George Soros\u2019s commitment of $10 million per year for three years to Al Gore\u2019s Alliance for Climate Protection, which conducts public education on the climate issue in pursuit of creating political space for aggressive U.S. action in line with what scientists say is necessary to put our nation on a path to reducing its outsize carbon dioxide emissions.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear what year the memo was sent, but the Gore co-founded Alliance for Climate Protection (ACP) was established in 2006 and lasted until it became The Climate Reality Project in July 2011. In 2008, the Alliance launched a $300 million campaign to encourage \u201cAmericans to push for aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d The Washington Post reported . Global Warming is NOT caused by humans: 10 Prominent Scientists Refuting 'Manmade Global Warming' with Solid Research ACP got $10 million from the Open Society Institute (OSI) in 2008, according to the nonprofit\u2019s tax filings. OSI handed over another $5 million to ACP in 2009, according to tax filings. The investigative reporting group ProPublica keeps a database that has OSI tax returns from 2000 to 2013. TheDCNF could not find other years where OSI gave money to ACP.OSI is primarily a grant-making nonprofit that hands out millions of dollars every year to mostly left-wing causes. Now called the Open Society Foundations, Soros\u2019s nonprofit has handed out more than $13 billion over the last three decades.OSI didn\u2019t only plan to fund Gore\u2019s climate group to promote global warming policies in the U.S., OSI also planned on giving millions of dollars to spur the \u201cyouth climate movement.\u201d Greenpeace Founder: Humans Not to Blame for Global Warming \u201cThis budget item also allows for the renewal of U.S. Programs\u2019 long-standing support of the Energy Action Coalition, which is the lead organizer of the youth climate movement in the U.S., the memo reads.\u201cWe are also including a placeholder for an additional $2 million, pending discussion about and development of OSI\u2019s global warming agenda,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cThere is a memo from Nancy Youman in the strategic plans binder that recommends pathways forward for OSI on the climate issue \u2013 in the U.S., as well as in other parts of the Open Society Network.\u201d By Michael Bastasch  \""}, "time": 1742563143.8987305}
