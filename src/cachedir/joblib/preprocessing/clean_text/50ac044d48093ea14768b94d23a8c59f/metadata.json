Former rivals were holding their noses to support him. He was dominating delegate elections, positioning himself for what seemed increasingly likely to be a floor fight at the Republican convention in July, as the campaign of Donald J. Trump fell into internal disarray. \u201cTonight is a turning point,\u201d Mr. Cruz said on primary night in Milwaukee. \u201cIt is a rallying cry. \u201d It was neither. On Tuesday, Mr. Cruz ended his campaign, his loss in Indiana extinguishing any chance of denying Mr. Trump the nomination. \u201cTogether we left it all on the field in Indiana,\u201d Mr. Cruz told supporters here as cries of \u201cNooo!\u201d rained from the crowd. \u201cWe gave it everything we\u2019ve got. But the voters chose another path. \u201d Yet to dismiss Mr. Cruz as an   would diminish his unlikely feat in outlasting nearly every rival: His calls for conservative purity were, for better or worse, the most consistent message in the field, his rage against the \u201cWashington cartel\u201d a signal of the nation\u2019s   view of its leaders. In a year when many voters flocked to the candidate they hoped could startle Washington into submission, Mr. Cruz galvanized millions of supporters drawn to his more ideological conservatism, quoting founding documents and   texts. He was the most   candidate to even sniff the nomination in at least a  . Long before Mr. Trump careered into the race, Mr. Cruz staked perhaps the loudest claim to the boiling national anger among   conservatives in the age of President Obama. He was  . \u201cTed Cruz\u2019s theory of the race was that conservatives were angry,\u201d said Ben Domenech, the publisher of The Federalist, a conservative online journal. \u201cIt turns out that everyone was angry. \u201d For a candidate who appeared, just a few weeks ago, to have a plausible path to the nomination, the descent came quickly. The calendar did not help. Hours after his Wisconsin victory, he charged headlong into New York City, earning Bronx jeers that foretold a hostile reception across a   Eastern states that were never a natural fit for him. \u201cManhattan has spoken!\u201d Mr. Cruz joked bitterly in Indiana. \u201cEveryone give up and go home. \u201d But the problems ran deeper. Given an opening to unite the party in opposition to a man many see as an existential threat to it, Mr. Cruz was unable to consolidate support, leaving Republican leaders lurching toward a fateful bet: Live with the risk of a Trump nomination rather than elevate a figure they loathe. His advisers insisted that he was a more versatile candidate than past Iowa caucus winners like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, but he failed to sufficiently expand his appeal much beyond the party\u2019s most religious and ideological voters. His surrogates in Indiana looked much the same as in Iowa, with   testimonials from the radio host Glenn Beck and Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas. \u201cConservatives are uniting,\u201d Mr. Cruz said often on the campaign trail, long after it felt true. But his efforts were undercut, in large measure, by his toxic relationships with Senate colleagues and a manifest indifference to repairing them. Soon, the indignities mounted. He named Carly Fiorina his prospective running mate, despite trailing by several hundred delegates, briefly rousing a partly full Indianapolis pavilion. He earned scorn in Indiana for referring to a basketball rim as a \u201cring. \u201d He was heckled by a young boy in La Porte and several   men in Marion. \u201cSir, with all respect,\u201d Mr. Cruz pleaded, after approaching one of them for a chat on Monday, \u201cDonald Trump is deceiving you. He is playing you for a chump. \u201d On Tuesday morning, he at last unburdened himself in full, promising to tell reporters \u201cwhat I really think of Donald Trump\u201d for the first time. \u201cThis man is a pathological liar,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, ticking off Mr. Trump\u2019s distortions, his infidelities, his penchant for conspiracy theories. \u201cThe man is utterly amoral. \u201d It is possible there is nothing more Mr. Cruz could have done. Mr. Trump has proved immune to political gravity. He has been largely impervious to attacks, once Mr. Cruz backed away from his monthslong embrace and began hammering him. Most critically, Mr. Trump\u2019s success in early states across the South, thought to be Mr. Cruz\u2019s firewall, forced a rewrite of the Cruz campaign playbook on the fly. But while few politicians have better absorbed the lessons of the party\u2019s rightward tilt in recent years, Mr. Cruz found himself outmaneuvered on issues like trade and national defense by an outsider whose political antenna had a crisper signal. Even on immigration  \u2014   where Mr. Cruz\u2019s grasp of the party\u2019s id helped vanquish a foe, Marco Rubio, who came to regret embracing a pathway to citizenship  \u2014   Mr. Trump managed to go bigger and louder. That Mr. Cruz lasted this long anyway was a triumph of management guile and considerable hustle: No Republican campaign more effectively marshaled its finances, holding the most cash on hand for much of the race, and no candidate worked harder than he did, frequently dashing through six events a day in Iowa. With a showman\u2019s itch and a singular manner of speaking  \u2014   the long pauses, the controlled twang, the easy deployment of words like \u201c\u00e9lan\u201d and \u201chosannas\u201d on the stump  \u2014   Mr. Cruz registered at times like an actor playing the role of presidential candidate. He often resorted to gimmickry, from   movie scenes to lawyerly theatrics to his grandest stunt of all: adding Mrs. Fiorina to an imagined ticket. But these last few, flailing weeks belied a campaign that for months had followed its initial strategy to the letter. Mr. Cruz and his advisers often likened the election to a college basketball tournament bracket, where opponents like Scott Walker and Mr. Rubio were to be muscled out one by one. (They also griped that Gov. John Kasich of Ohio failed to leave the court, despite the score.) When Mr. Cruz entered the race, his team openly cheered its meager position, roughly 5 percent in the polls, reasoning that he could energize his core supporters first. \u201cYou have to own a base in the Republican primary,\u201d his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said the day Mr. Cruz announced his run at an evangelical university last year. \u201cIf you own the base, then you can grow it. \u201d Mr. Cruz\u2019s most consequential choice might have come last year when he defended Mr. Trump as a credible outsider and a force for good in the race as rivals began taking swings. As late as December, he celebrated Mr. Trump as \u201cterrific,\u201d rising quietly in the polls as Mr. Trump absorbed the slings and arrows directed to a  . Even after Mr. Trump began disparaging Mr. Cruz\u2019s Canadian birth, the senator initially resisted a   barrage. Eventually, his broadsides were frequent and scattershot: Mr. Trump was too unsteady, too shifty, too consumed by social media, too much like Hillary Clinton. Recently, as Mr. Cruz\u2019s growth seemed to reach its outer bounds, he leaned increasingly on this sort of messaging potpourri. He tried positioning himself as the party\u2019s champion of women. He cast himself as the heir to President Obama\u2019s generational promise, debuting a new slogan  \u2014   \u201cYes, we will!\u201d  \u2014   that was quickly abandoned. Then there was his habit of declaring as fact things he wished to be true. Mr. Cruz often described the \u201chard ceiling\u201d of support that Mr. Trump would surely brush up against, estimating it to be 35 to 40 percent. \u201cDonald has been a minority candidate, a fringe candidate,\u201d Mr. Cruz told reporters last week. The next day, Mr. Trump received at least 54 percent of the vote in all five primaries. And if Mr. Trump\u2019s chosen moniker for Mr. Cruz (\u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d) was not quite as instantly devastating as some of his others (\u201c \u201d Jeb Bush, \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio) the Cruz campaign contributed to lending it a ring of truth  \u2014   not least because of his abrupt antagonism toward Mr. Trump after reams of praise. While Mr. Cruz steadied himself, rebounding in his home state of Texas and winning several smaller contests and delegate conventions, his successes were too few. Even in victory, Mr. Cruz spoke often in apocalyptic terms. Facing defeat, his pleas grew pained. \u201cIf Indiana does not act,\u201d he said hours before Tuesday\u2019s vote, \u201cthis country could well plunge into the abyss. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563233.6210408}
