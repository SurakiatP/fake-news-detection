This, in turn, will prevent unwanted acrimony in families in India and foster better husband-wife relationships. The number of married Indian men who remember their wedding anniversaries is abysmal and this is an earnest effort to improve the rate. Even today, lakhs of Indian married men who sign up for anything online and create an account anywhere usually choose \u2018What is your first pet\u2019s name?\u2019, or \u2018When is your birthday?\u2019, or \u2018Which is your favorite car?\u2019 as their security question,\u201d WCD Minister Maneka Gandhi told The UnReal Times . \\n\u201cHardly anyone ever chooses \u2018What is your anniversary date?\u2019 as a security question, simply because there have been people who have forgotten their passwords and not only have they been unable to retrieve their accounts due to inability to answer the security question correctly, but they have also been unable to retrieve access to their own households, due to highly miffed wives. We do not want to further penalize those who forget their anniversaries as they would already be in deep shit, so we\u2019re trying to change this the positive way \u2013 by honoring those few who do. We hope the number of men who do remember the anniversaries grows due to this,\u201d Gandhi added. \\nThe ministry\u2019s policy, however, wasn\u2019t without its share of initial controversy. BJP MP Varun Gandhi, who was one of the first married men to stake claim for the award, after bravely selecting the anniversary security question while registering at Patanjali\u2019s online retail website to buy their honey bottles, has been denied an award by his mother. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Varun\u2019s case is special \u2013 anything other than honey and I would gladly give him the award. I will even overlook the fact that our women journos\u2019 Whatsapp group was totally against Varun buying things from Patanjali, of all places, but honey is an absolute no-no,\u201d Maneka Gandhi is reported to have said. \\nVarun\u2019s act of bravado reportedly hasn\u2019t found favor with his better half too. \u201cPoor Varun, he told Yamini \u2018I\u2019ll never forget our anniversary, honey!\u2019 to which she yelled back \u2018Don\u2019t you dare say honey again!\u2019\u201d a WCD ministry source told The UnReal Times .
