He called it \u201cthe final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land. \u201d \u201cI honored their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy,\u201d Mr. Modi added. Indian leaders have long been skeptical of American military power and have often been deeply critical of the Vietnam War and other military interventions by the United States. Celebrating American war dead, though, was a telling signal of what both sides say is a very different relationship between the two countries. Mr. Modi has encouraged a continued American military presence in Afghanistan because he is worried that Pakistan will have unchallenged influence there once the Americans leave. \u201cYour contribution in keeping the region safe and secure is deeply appreciated,\u201d Mr. Modi said, adding: \u201cA commitment to rebuild a peaceful and stable and prosperous Afghanistan is our shared objective. \u201d Almost exactly 31 years ago, Rajiv Gandhi, then India\u2019s prime minister, also spoke of Afghanistan in an address to Congress. But he did it in the context of justifying the Soviet military presence there because, he said, Soviet troops were \u201cinvited by the Karmal regime,\u201d a reference to the   government of President Babrak Karmal. The different references to Afghanistan are a measure of just how much relations between the world\u2019s largest democracies have changed in three decades. In another sign of a break with the past, Mr. Modi gave a strong endorsement for global institutions, most of them created with American leadership. \u201cGrowing uncertainties and political complexities  \u2014   our engagement can make a difference by promoting cooperation, not dominance,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cConnectivity, not isolation. Inclusive, not exclusive mechanism. Respect for global commons and, above all, for international rules and norms. \u201d Then Mr. Modi made an explicit reference to China by endorsing the \u201cfreedom of navigation on seas,\u201d referring to disputes involving the South China Sea and China\u2019s efforts to carve out part of those waters as its own. Mr. Modi was the fifth Indian prime minister to address Congress, and the appearance represents a turnaround in his acceptance within the United States. For years Mr. Modi was barred from getting a visa to come here because of his role in 2002 riots in the Indian state of Gujarat that cost the lives of more than 1, 000 people, mostly Muslims. But as he rose as a national political figure in India, United States diplomats sought to put that difficult history to rest. Mr. Modi\u2019s decision to accelerate   ties with the United States has been greeted in Washington with excitement and surprise. On Tuesday, he held meetings at the White House with President Obama, where the two leaders formalized a wide range of agreements covering climate change, renewable energy, security and economic issues. Before Congress, Mr. Modi also repeated that India was open for business. Mr. Modi is eager for greater foreign investment, and although he has failed to deliver many fundamental reforms that would make business easier to conduct there, the smaller steps he has taken and his obvious enthusiasm have persuaded some major investors to give India a try. In his speech, Mr. Modi gave a nod to his difficulties in passing much of his economic reform agenda. Although Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party has a majority in the Lok Sabha, India\u2019s lower house of Parliament, it does not have a majority in the upper house, the Rajya Sabha. \u201cMr. Speaker, I\u2019m informed that the working of the U. S. Congress is harmonious,\u201d Mr. Modi said to laughter. \u201cI\u2019m also told that you\u2019re well known for your bipartisanship. Well, you are not alone. Time and again, I have also witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament. \u201d India\u2019s economy is now the   large economy in the world, but jobs are not being created at anywhere close to the pace needed to employ the roughly one million Indians who come of age each month. Mr. Modi also touched on the issue of climate change in his speech, but subtly reinforced the point that the willingness of India  \u2014   the world\u2019s   carbon emitter  \u2014   to cut its own pollution will depend on help from the United States. \u201cThe protection of the environment and caring of the planet is central to our vision of a just world,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cfor us in India to live in harmony with mother earth is part of our ancient beliefs. \u201d But, he said, \u201cOur partnership aims to balance responsibility and capacity and focuses on new ways to increase availability of renewable energy. \u201d Mr. Modi has vowed to sharply increase the growth of solar power in India, but Indian diplomats have also pushed for commitments from the United States to make new solar power technologies available as cheaply as possible, either by waiving intellectual property fees or by providing favorable financing. \u201cThis has been the goal of our efforts in G20 and climate change summits,\u201d Mr. Modi said, to a mixed ovation  \u2014   lawmakers on the Democratic side of the aisle stood and clapped, while those on the Republican side mostly stayed seated. Mr. Modi was forceful in his condemnation of global terrorism, a subject he dwelt on at length. \u201cNot just in Afghanistan but elsewhere in South Asia and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat,\u201d he said, adding in a clear reference to Pakistan: \u201cAlthough its shadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in India\u2019s neighborhood. \u201d India\u2019s long rivalry with Pakistan has meant that India has been a target of terror attacks funded and encouraged by Pakistan, most famously in the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008. Some members of Congress have criticized Mr. Modi\u2019s human rights record, but the politics of a visit by an Indian leader have also changed. Before Mr. Modi spoke, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced more than a dozen members of Congress who were said to be escorting Mr. Modi into the chamber. There are 3. 5 million   and they are a highly successful immigrant group with both wealth and deep community connections, making them sought after by politicians. In just one example, some 40 percent of hotel rooms in the United States are owned or managed by   according to Arun K. Singh, India\u2019s ambassador to the United States.'"}, "time": 1742564607.5639808}
