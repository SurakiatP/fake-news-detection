Revolutionary hymns evoked the bloody years, from 1937 to 1945, of what is known outside China as the Second   War. Chinese documentaries denounced Japan\u2019s \u201ceight years of belligerence. \u201d Now the war is getting a new name, and an extended time frame. In a move aimed at stirring up nationalism and support for the ruling Communist Party, President Xi Jinping\u2019s government has ordered educators to rewrite textbooks to describe the conflict as the \u201c  War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression,\u201d lasting from 1931 to 1945, the authorities said in a statement on Wednesday. Under the decision, the Second   War will be described as having started in the fall of 1931, when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Manchuria. Previously, the war\u2019s beginning had been traced to the Marco Polo Bridge incident, a skirmish in 1937 between Japanese forces and Chinese troops along a rail line southwest of Beijing that represented the beginning of   conflict. The Chinese Ministry of Education said the decision to add six years to the war sought to promote patriotic education and to highlight the Communist Party\u2019s \u201ccore role\u201d in resisting Japanese fascism in the prelude to World War II. It also seemed intended to rally support for the party among young people as Mr. Xi vigorously promotes Communist history and thought in schools. Zhang Lifan, a historian in Beijing, said the decision to revise the length of the war was justified from a historical perspective. But he said it would also have political benefits for the party and would encourage   sentiment. \u201cChinese leaders still have a Cold War mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried to conjure up imaginary enemies in the world. \u201d Mr. Xi has worked in recent years to enhance the image of the Communists and their achievements in World War II, even though many historians believe it was the Chinese Nationalists, not the Communists, who did most of the fighting. The party had not previously emphasized the fight against the Japanese from 1931 to 1937, when Communist forces were in disarray as they fought a civil war with the Nationalists. During that time, the Nationalists led efforts to resist the Japanese and negotiate truces. It was not until 1937 that the Communists joined forces with the Nationalists to fight an increasingly belligerent Imperial Japanese Army. Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King\u2019s College London, called the textbook revision a \u201ctidying up of history. \u201d He said the revised account exaggerated the Communists\u2019 accomplishments. \u201cIt demonstrates this continuing keenness by the party now to seek sources of legitimacy wherever it can,\u201d he said, \u201cand reveals more insecurity than real strength. \u201d The change will probably ruffle feathers in Japan, China\u2019s longtime rival, as the countries jockey for influence in Asia and struggle to overcome the legacy of World War II, more than 70 years after the global conflict ended. Yasuhisa Kawamura, press secretary for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Thursday that it was not up to the Chinese government to decide the length of the war. \u201cIt is important that Japan and China should demonstrate they do not focus excessively on the unfortunate past,\u201d he added. Mr. Xi has accused Japan of distorting history, and the Chinese state news media has criticized Tokyo\u2019s efforts to revise textbooks, saying it has played down atrocities by Japanese soldiers. When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan visited Pearl Harbor last month, Chinese internet users brimmed with outrage, saying Mr. Abe had not done enough to apologize to China for Japan\u2019s actions during the war. In Beijing, many people applauded the government\u2019s decision to revise the textbooks, which are filled with references to wars against \u201caggression\u201d by foreign forces. The Korean War, for example, is known as the war to resist United States aggression and aid Korea. \u201cThe Japanese have also altered their textbooks, why can\u2019t we?\u201d said Wang Yalin, 30, a musician. Still, he said, the change would most likely fuel   sentiment in China. Zhao Feng, 38, a tailor, acknowledged that the relationship between the countries had deteriorated. But he said it was important to note the earlier date of Japan\u2019s invasion of China. \u201cThe occupation started much earlier,\u201d he said. On social media, some people were more skeptical of the government\u2019s motives for making the change. \u201cDon\u2019t use history education for political ends,\u201d one person wrote on Weibo, China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter. \u201cThe most important thing is to learn the truth. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561820.708385}
