The staff of the company, based in Buckfield, Me. wondered whether the Trumps planned to continue distributing the wooden eggs as party favors, or whether they were even going to have a White House Easter Egg Roll at all. By early March, the White House announced that the roll was on  \u2014   Monday, to be exact  \u2014   and soon followed up with a rush order for the wooden eggs. By that time, the ovoid uncertainty had raised a question perhaps not as consequential as investigations into Russian interference in the presidential election, a legally dubious travel ban and a collapsed health care bill, but no less a window into the inner workings of the Trump administration: Could this White House, plagued by slow hiring and lacking an   first lady, manage to pull off the largest, most elaborate and most heavily scrutinized public event of the year? \u201cIt\u2019s the single most   event that takes place at the White House each year, and the White House and the first lady are judged on how well they put it on,\u201d said Melinda Bates, who organized eight years of Easter Egg Rolls as director of the White House Visitors Office under President Bill Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned for the Trump people, because they have failed to fill some really vital posts, and this thing is all hands on deck. \u201d White House party catastrophes have been the stuff of presidential nightmares in the past. During his first year in office, President Barack Obama drew harsh criticism for lax security procedures after a pair of aspiring   celebrities successfully crashed a state dinner honoring the prime minister of India, with one of them managing to buttonhole Mr. Obama for a handshake. The late start in planning by the Trump White House points to a smaller and less ambitious Egg Roll than in previous years. There may be half as many guests, a fraction of the number of volunteers to manage the invasion of the South Lawn, and military bands in place of   entertainers like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Idina Menzel and Silent\u00f3 who have performed for Egg Rolls past. White House officials did not respond to several weeks\u2019 worth of inquiries about the Easter Egg Roll, typically a heavily and enthusiastically promoted affair, and declined to provide basic information such as how many people are expected to attend. It is unclear, for instance, whether Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, will reprise his appearance in a bunny suit for the event, as he did a decade ago when George W. Bush was president and Mr. Spicer was an aide in the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Stephanie Grisham, who started as Mrs. Trump\u2019s communications director on Monday, had previously denied that the event was being scaled back from past years. But she acknowledged on Tuesday that attendance this year would be \u201ca bit less,\u201d based on feedback from former officials who had said \u201cthe event had become so large that many children were not able to enjoy the planned activities. \u201d \u201cOur team has been working very hard to make this year\u2019s event a success,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. \u201cI am confident that the success of this year\u2019s Easter Egg Roll will speak for itself. \u201d The evidence points to a quickly   affair that people close to the planning said would probably draw about 20, 000 people  \u2014   substantially smaller than last year\u2019s Easter Egg Roll, which drew 37, 000. It will be staffed by 500 volunteers, Ms. Grisham said, half the usual. Ms. Grisham said she did not have \u201cfirm numbers\u201d on the overall number of attendees, and those who provided estimates did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the plans for the Easter Egg Roll, which are still evolving just a week before the event. The White House has ordered 40, 000 of the commemorative eggs  \u2014   about half of the roughly 85, 000 ordered in 2016  \u2014   with 18, 000 to be given away at the Easter Egg Roll and another 22, 000 available for sale, according to Lara Kline, the vice president for marketing and communications at the White House Historical Association, the official retailer. The relatively small number, Ms. Kline said, \u201cis due to the limited manufacturing window for this year\u2019s Easter Egg Roll. \u201d The employees at Wells Wood Turning were not alone in wondering whether the White House would ever get in touch.   public schools that normally receive blocks of tickets for as many as 4, 000 children have yet to hear from the White House, according to representatives for school systems in the District of Columbia Arlington, Va. and Alexandria, Va. Several groups representing military families, who have accounted for as many as 3, 000 guests in recent years, also said they had yet to be contacted. \u201cI\u2019ve had quite a few families from across the country reach out and say: \u2018Hey, are we getting tickets? Our family wants to drive in for the event,\u2019\u201d said Ashley   the president of the American Military Partner Association, which represents the families of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender service members and has received tickets for five to 10 of them for each of the last several years. \u201cUnfortunately, the Trump administration has not reached out about it. \u201d But Ms. Grisham said on Tuesday that tickets had been set aside for schools, children\u2019s hospitals and military families. She could not say how many. Even Curious George and Elmo did not know for sure that the Easter Egg Roll was happening until late last month, when the White House first contacted PBS Kids to ask if it could provide costumed characters. \u201cWe just got word about this year\u2019s Egg Roll and are working on planning,\u201d Jennifer Rankin Byrne, the senior director of media relations for PBS, said on March 20. The Easter Egg Roll has been crowded in past years with cast members from \u201cSesame Street,\u201d but this year, there will be a lone emissary. \u201cPBS asked us to participate with them, and we agreed to provide a \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 character,\u201d said Elizabeth Weinreb Fishman, the vice president for strategic communications for Sesame Workshop. She declined to say which character would attend, referring questions to the White House. Members of Congress have not received word from the White House about whether they will get tickets to distribute to their constituents. One aide to a Republican lawmaker said White House officials \u201cseem to be a bit behind schedule. \u201d Nor have the organizers of the Yoga Garden featured on the South Lawn during   Easter Egg Rolls been asked to share their asanas. \u201cNo one has reached out to me about the 2017 event,\u201d said Leah Cullis, the yogi who coordinated the Yoga Garden for all eight of the Obamas\u2019 Easter Egg Rolls. Mrs. Trump, who lives in New York and has had a limited presence in Washington since her husband was sworn in, has been slow to hire a staff for the East Wing, which typically takes the lead on the Easter Egg Roll. She named a chief of staff and social secretary in early February but has yet to announce a director for the Visitors Office, normally the crucial player in the daunting execution of the event. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what a beast this thing is to plan until you go and plan your first one,\u201d said Ellie Schafer, who organized Easter Egg Rolls for the Obamas as the director of the White House Visitors Office from 2009 to 2016. \u201cEvery administration tries to put its own stamp on it, but the stakes are high because it\u2019s such a Washington tradition, and people just love it and have very strong feelings about it. \u201d Ms. Bates, whose memoir \u201cWhite House Story\u201d documents the challenges of planning   Easter Egg Rolls, said the event was a window  \u2014   up to a point  \u2014   into the competence of an administration. \u201cIf you can pull off an Easter Egg Roll,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can do anything. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561639.5246608}
