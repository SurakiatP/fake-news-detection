She was 51. The cause was ovarian cancer, which she learned she had in September 2015, her agent, Amy Rennert, said. Ms. Rosenthal\u2019s bittersweet paean to her spouse of 26 years appeared as a Modern Love column in the online Style section of The Times on March 3 and in the Sunday newspaper section on March 5. The column has drawn almost four and a half million readers online. \u201cI want more time with Jason,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI want more time with my children. I want more time sipping martinis at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. But that is not going to happen. I probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet. So why I am doing this? \u201cI am wrapping this up on Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d she continued, \u201cand the most genuine,    gift I can hope for is that the right person reads this, finds Jason, and another love story begins. \u201d Her husband said in a statement afterward, \u201cWhen I read her words for the first time, I was shocked at the beauty, slightly surprised at the incredible prose given her condition and, of course, emotionally ripped apart. \u201d Since 2005, Ms. Rosenthal has written 28 spirited children\u2019s picture books, two quirky, poignant memoirs (\u201cTextbook Amy Krouse Rosenthal,\u201d in 2016, and an alphabetized \u201cEncyclopedia of an Ordinary Life,\u201d in 2005) delivered TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) Talks and NPR commentaries and produced short films and YouTube videos of what she called social experiments, with titles like \u201cATM: Always Trust Magic,\u201d \u201cThe Money Tree\u201d and \u201cThe Beckoning of Lovely. \u201d \u201cI tend to believe whatever you decide to look for you will find, whatever you beckon will eventually beckon you,\u201d she told one audience. She beckoned her readers and viewers. In a video called \u201c17 Things I Made\u201d  \u2014   among them were her books and even a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  \u2014   she welcomed fans to join her at Millennium Park in Chicago, on Aug. 8, 2008, at 8:08 p. m. to make an 18th thing. Hundreds showed up. \u201cAmy ran at life full speed and heart first,\u201d Maria Modugno, her editor at Random House, said in a phone interview. \u201cHer writing was who she was. \u201d She started writing ad copy after graduating from Tufts University in 1987. After nine years at Foote, Cone  Belding (now FCB) Ms. Rosenthal was on maternity leave with her two toddler sons and infant daughter at McDonald\u2019s when she experienced what she called a \u201cMcEpiphany,\u201d deciding to become an author. What she described as her plastic fork in the road led to countless dead ends, however, until she published \u201cLittle Pea,\u201d about a pod denied his favorite dessert (spinach) until he finished all his candy (which he detested). The book received favorable reviews, and her course was set. Her other books included \u201cSpoon,\u201d \u201cDuck! Rabbit!\u201d and \u201cLittle Oink. \u201d In The New York Times Book Review in 2009 Bruce Handy said of her work: \u201cFor all I know, she may suffer torment upon torment in front of a blank screen, but the results read as if they were a pleasure to write. \u201d He added, \u201cHer books radiate fun the way tulips radiate spring: they are elegant and  . \u201d Amy Renee Krouse was born on April 29, 1965, in Chicago to Paul Krouse and the former Ann Wolk, both publishers. Both survive her. Besides her husband and parents, she is survived by her sons, Justin and Miles her daughter, Paris her sisters, Katie Froelich and Beth Kaufmann and her brother, Joe Krouse. \u201cI was simply born with a fondness for letters and language and predisposed to enjoy playing around with them and it,\u201d Ms. Rosenthal wrote in a memoir. Ms. Rennert, her agent, said Ms. Rosenthal had completed seven more picture books before her death, including a collaboration with her daughter called \u201cDear Girl. \u201d But even before her diagnosis, she suggested that her energy and imagination were not boundless. Her favorite line from literature, she once said, was in Thornton Wilder\u2019s play \u201cOur Town,\u201d as spoken by the character Emily as she bids the world goodbye: \u201cDo any human beings ever realize life while they live it?\u201d When she reached 40, Ms. Rosenthal began calculating how many days she had left until she turned 80. \u201cHow many more times, then, do I get to look at a tree?\u201d she asked. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it\u2019s 12, 395. Absolutely, that\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s not infinite, and I\u2019m thinking anything less than infinite is too small a number and not satisfactory. At the very least, I want to look at trees a million more times. Is that too much to ask?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561912.3725996}
