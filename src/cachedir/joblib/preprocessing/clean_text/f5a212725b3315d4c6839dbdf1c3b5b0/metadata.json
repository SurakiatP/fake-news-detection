The remarks were the strongest yet by the South Korean leadership linking the North Korean government, led by Kim   to the brazen killing of Mr. Kim\u2019s half brother on Feb. 13 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. In his remarks, Mr. Hwang also urged the world to hold North Korea accountable for the killing. \u201cIt starkly demonstrated the North Korean regime\u2019s recklessness and cruelty as well as the fact that it will do anything, everything in order to maintain its power,\u201d Mr. Hwang said during a meeting of   cabinet ministers on Monday. \u201cWe need to cooperate with the international community to ensure that North Korea will pay a just price for its terrorist act. \u201d Mr. Hwang\u2019s comments escalated pressure on North Korea by formally accusing Mr. Kim\u2019s government of carrying out a terrorist attack, which could encourage other nations, including the United States, to try to punish the government in Pyongyang. Mr. Hwang instructed his government to strengthen vigilance and precautions against possible North Korean terrorist attacks on the government and citizens of the South. He also warned that North Korea may try military provocations to divert international attention from the killing. The statement came as tensions escalated Monday between North Korea and Malaysia as the police in Kuala Lumpur press on with their investigation of the killing, in which several North Korean citizens are being sought. Fuji TV in Japan posted what appeared to be airport security video footage of the attack on YouTube, which was later reposted by other sources. The North Korean ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, called the Malaysian inquiry politically motivated and demanded that his government be allowed to take part. Mr. Kang also found fault with Kim  \u2019s autopsy. \u201cIt has been seven days since the incident, but there is no clear evidence on the cause of death, and at the moment we cannot trust the investigation by the Malaysian police,\u201d Mr. Kang said. The North Korean Embassy later released a statement trying to raise doubts about whether the body was that of Mr. Kim, faulting the Malaysian authorities for \u201cidentifying the other name alleged by the hostile foreign forces. \u201d The statement said the deceased man, whom it identified as Kim Chol, held a diplomatic passport, and it criticized the Malaysian authorities for requiring the presence of next of kin for the body to be released. The Malaysian Foreign Ministry said it had summoned Mr. Kang to explain his accusation that Malaysia was \u201ccolluding\u201d with North Korea\u2019s enemies in its handling of Mr. Kim\u2019s death. Late Monday, the Malaysian foreign minister, Anifah Aman, responded to Mr. Kang\u2019s charges, saying they were based on \u201cdelusions, lies and  . \u201d Mr. Kang\u2019s suggestion that someone else\u2019s hand was behind the investigation was \u201cdeeply insulting to Malaysia,\u201d he said in a statement issued by his office. \u201cIn all civilized nations, it is the norm for cases such as these to be comprehensively investigated,\u201d Mr. Anifah said. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the government to do so. \u201d Mr. Kim was apparently poisoned by a woman who grabbed him from behind at the airport and wiped his face with a cloth. He died on the way to a hospital. The Malaysian police have arrested four people and are seeking seven others, most of them North Korean. In its meeting with Mr. Kang, the Malaysian government called his accusations \u201cbaseless\u201d and said the police were following normal procedures in the case of a death \u201cunder mysterious circumstances. \u201d Malaysia has told North Korea that it will give the body to Mr. Kim\u2019s next of kin once the investigation is complete. \u201cThe Malaysian government has been transparent,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Malaysian government takes very seriously any unfounded attempt to tarnish its reputation. \u201d The South Korean unification minister, Hong   said on Monday that eight North Koreans were involved in the case, including one who was arrested, four who were believed to have returned home and three others who were still being sought by the Malaysian authorities. Speaking to reporters in Seoul, Mr. Hong declined to reveal the additional information his government had that helped it determine North Korean involvement. But he said the fact that several suspects were from North Korea was significant evidence itself. He also noted that North Korea had a history of committing terrorist attacks abroad and executing its own officials deemed a threat to the country\u2019s leader. \u201cThe North Korean regime depends on a reign of terror and fears to help maintain its grip on power,\u201d Mr. Hong said about the possible motive behind the killing. In Indonesia, Agung Sampurno, an Immigration Department spokesman, said that at least three North Korean suspects who left Malaysia in the hours after the killing on Feb. 13 arrived in Jakarta later that day. They left Jakarta at 10:20 p. m. on a flight to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, before they were believed to have returned to North Korea.'"}, "time": 1742563812.3189375}
