Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner is under investigation for allegedly sending illicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl. \\nAs of Saturday night, the FBI had still not gotten approval from the Justice Department for a warrant that would allow them to read any of the newly discovered Abedin emails, and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen. \\n\u201cWe do not have a warrant,\u201d a senior law enforcement official said. \u201cDiscussions are underway [between the FBI and the Justice Department] as to the best way to move forward.\u201d \\nThat Comey and other senior FBI officials were unaware of what was in the emails \u2014 and whether they contained any material the FBI had not already obtained \u2014 is important because the campaign of Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have suggested that the FBI director would not have written his letter unless he had been made aware of significant new emails that might justify reopening the investigation into the Clinton server. \\nBut a message that Comey wrote to all FBI agents Friday seeking to explain his decision to write the controversial letter strongly hinted that investigators did not not yet have legal authority establishing \u201cprobable cause\u201d to review the content of Abedin\u2019s emails on Weiner\u2019s electronic devices. \\nIn that message, Comey told agents that he had only been briefed on Thursday about the matter and that the \u201crecommendation\u201d of investigators was \u201cwith respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case.\u201d \\nComey approved the recommendation to seek judicial access to the material that day, he wrote. \\n\u201cBecause those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them,\u201d he told agents. Comey\u2019s letter to Congress has brought the FBI director under withering criticism. Top Justice Department officials were described by a government source as \u201capoplectic\u201d over the letter. Senior officials \u201cstrongly discouraged\u201d Comey from sending it, telling FBI officials last week it would violate longstanding department policy against taking actions in the days before an election that might influence the outcome, a U.S official familiar with the matter told Yahoo News. \u201cHe was acting independently of the guidance given to him,\u201d said the U.S. official. \\nComey insisted in his message to agents that he felt he had \u201can obligation\u201d to inform Congress about the new material because he had previously testified that the bureau\u2019s investigation into the Clinton email server was completed. He said it would be \u201cmisleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.\u201d He added, \u201cGiven that we don\u2019t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don\u2019t want to create a misleading impression.\u201d \\nThe decision to send the letter \u201cwasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said the senior law enforcement official. Comey and top FBI officials debated what course to take once they learned about the discovery on Weiner\u2019s laptop \u2013\u2013 said to include thousands of Abedin\u2019s emails. In the end, the official said, Comey feared that if he chose to move forward and seek access to the emails and didn\u2019t immediately alert Congress, the FBI\u2019s efforts would leak to the media and the director would be accused of concealing information. \\n\u201cThis was the least bad choice,\u201d the senior official said. \\nBut Comey\u2019s letter to Congress \u2014 suggesting that the FBI might now revisit the Clinton email probe \u2014 may have been even more misleading, some critics charged Saturday. \\n\u201cThis letter is troubling because it is vaguely worded and leaves so many questions unanswered,\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and three other Democrats on the panel wrote Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \\n\u201cIt is not clear whether the emails identified by the FBI are even in the custody of the FBI, whether any of the emails have already been reviewed, whether Secretary Clinton sent or received them, or whether they even have any significance to the FBI\u2019s previous investigation,\u201d the senators wrote. A Yahoo News review of Abedin\u2019s interview with FBI agents last April \u2014 when the Clinton email probe was in full swing \u2014 shows that the longtime Clinton aide hinted that there might be relevant material on her husband\u2019s personal devices. But agents do not appear to have followed up on the clues. \\nAbedin, who served as Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff and held a top-secret security clearance, disclosed she had access to four email accounts while working at the State Department. \\nThese accounts, Abedin said, included an official State Department email account, but also an account on Clinton\u2019s private email server that Abedin used to communicate with Clinton and her top aides, as well as a personal Yahoo account. She used both the Clinton email account and the Yahoo account to \u201croutinely\u201d forward State Department emails and documents so she could more easily print them, she said. In addition, she told the agents, she had a separate email account that she had previously used \u201cto support her husband\u2019s political activities.\u201d \\nAbedin\u2019s interview \u2014 conducted by agents at the FBI\u2019s Washington field office last April 5 \u2014 was the first tip-off that the longtime Clinton aide might have circulated official State Department material among her multiple accounts. At one point, agents even confronted Abedin on one apparently sensitive email about U.S. policy towards Pakistan that had been forwarded to her State Department account from an aide to the late Richard Holbrooke, then a special State Department envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Abedin had forwarded the email to her Yahoo account in order to print it, but told agents she was \u201cunaware of the classification of the document and stated that she did not make judgments on the classification of material she received. Instead, she relied on the sender to make that assessment and to properly make and transmit the document.\u201d There is no indication from the eight-page FBI report on the interview, however, that the agents ever pressed her on what has now turned into an explosive issue in the final days of the 2016 campaign: Did Weiner have access to any classified government documents on his laptop and iPhone \u2014 devices that, he apparently used to exchange sexually charged messages with women he met online, including in one alleged case, an underage teenager in North Carolina? \\nThe fact that FBI agents failed to do so shows that the original probe into the Clinton email server was \u201cnot thorough\u201d and was \u201cfatally flawed,\u201d said Joseph DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney and independent counsel who has been a strong critic of Comey and the FBI probe. \u201cThe first thing they should have done was gotten a sworn affidavit about all her accounts and devices,\u201d he said, adding that agents should have immediately followed up to obtain the devices, including Weiner\u2019s. \\nBut it is still far from clear which State Department emails might be on the devices that Weiner had access to. In a separate civil lawsuit brought by a conservative group, Judicial Watch, Abedin gave testimony in June that appeared to differ in some respects from what she told the FBI. Asked in that case about her email accounts, Abedin told Judicial Watch lawyers that she rarely used the personal Yahoo account, and that when she did, she only used it to forward State Department \u201cpress clips\u201d so she could print them.'"}, "time": 1742562300.8802652}
