This is in contrast to the comments made by Hastings at Recode\u2019s Code Conference last month. Hastings claimed that Netflix is too big a company to bother with issues like net neutrality that wouldn\u2019t greatly affect them anymore: It\u2019s not our primary battle at this point. Other people it is, and that\u2019s an important thing, and we\u2019re supportive through the industry association, but I think you\u2019re right that we don\u2019t have the special vulnerability to it. We had to carry the water when we were growing up and we were small. Now other companies need to be on that leading edge.
