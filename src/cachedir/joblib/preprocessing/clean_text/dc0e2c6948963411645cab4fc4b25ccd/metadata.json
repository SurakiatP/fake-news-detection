[After The Washington Post obtained a copy of the confidential \u201cwhite paper\u201d that Bezos\u2019 space company Blue Origin is passing on to Trump\u2019s transition team, the company verified its authenticity. And while Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX rushes to beat Trump\u2019s own lunar ambitions, Bezos is focused on the logistics of something a little more permanent than private sightseeing excursions.  Blue Origin want to deliver cargo to the moon, paving the way for sustained human colonization of our natural satellite. They\u2019ve even picked a spot for this potential real estate  \u2014   a cheery little crater near the moon\u2019s south pole, with access to water via ice hidden in the crater\u2019s shadows, and enough consistent sunlight to make use of solar energy. The thought of lunar expansion has managed to whet the appetites of several companies, who are already offering their own ideas for involvement. One such example is Bigelow Aerospace. Its founder, Robert Bigelow, wants to adapt the design of their BEAM habitat, currently docked with the International Space Station. He wants to create an orbital depot to house supplies and medical facilities. According to Bigelow, venturing toward Mars is \u201cpremature. \u201d As for the moon? Bigelow asserts that \u201cWe have the technology. We have the ability, and the potential for a terrific business case. \u201d For his part, Bezos believes that \u201cif you go to the moon first, and make the moon your home, then you can get to Mars more easily. \u201d Bezos says that this project \u201conly be done in partnership with NASA,\u201d and believes that \u201c[Blue Origin\u2019s] liquid hydrogen expertise and experience with precision vertical landing offer the fastest path to a lunar lander mission. \u201d He is personally \u201cexcited about this,\u201d to the point of investing his own money \u201calongside NASA,\u201d to make sure they get there. \u201cBlue Moon is all about   delivery of mass to the surface of the Moon,\u201d according to the Amazon boss. \u201cAny credible first lunar settlement will require that capability\u201d But all of this is just the beginning of Blue Origin\u2019s ambitions. Their first proposed mission hopes to be just the first in \u201ca series of increasingly capable missions. \u201d We\u2019ll have to wait to see whether President Trump and his advisors are as excited about the possibilities as Bezos himself.
