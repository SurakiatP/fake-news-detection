[Fitton agreed with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow\u2019s contention that Trump \u201cchanged the debate\u201d when he alleged surveillance resources were improperly used against him by the Obama administration.  \u201cMany of us have been concerned not so much about the \u2018unicorn theory\u2019 of the election that the Left has been running, but about the fact that there was surveillance done of the Trump team, and then that surveillance  \u2014   which was classified in part  \u2014   was illegally leaked in an effort to destroy them,\u201d Fitton said. \u201cIf suspicions are correct that it was Obama administration officials, former officials who leaked that information, then those individuals could go to jail,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat\u2019s how serious the leaks were. \u201d \u201cBy President Trump\u2019s highlighting the fact that he was surveilled, allegedly personally  \u2014   whether he\u2019s right in the specifics or not, I don\u2019t know, but I think he\u2019s right generally in the sense that he was targeted with some type of surveillance, he and his team. Whether the surveillance was for other reasons and his team were picked up incidentally or not, that\u2019s to be found out. But we do know that surveillance was misused, and in my view, if it was misused, maybe it was done for improper purposes, as well,\u201d he said. Marlow noted that while mainstream media coverage strongly suggested an intensive investigation of Trump\u2019s campaign was in progress throughout the 2016 election, with plenty of surveillance, officials and congressional committees are now saying no \u201cwiretapping\u201d was conducted. \u201cWho\u2019s right on this thing?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what \u2018wiretapping\u2019 means,\u201d Fitton replied, comparing loose use of the term with former President Bill Clinton\u2019s notorious argument about the precise meaning of the word \u201cis. \u201d  \u201cWas there surveillance? Was there intelligence being gathered, and did it pick up either the Trump organization in terms of their internal communications or external communications, or his associates, either on the campaign or people close to him? That\u2019s what the media had been telling us for months and months and months,\u201d he pointed out.  \u201cAnd now, the media wants to have their cake and eat it too, in the sense that once Trump said, \u2018Hey, why was I being surveilled here?\u2019 they said, \u2018Oh, no, you weren\u2019t being surveilled.\u2019 Well, they had been reporting that people around him had been surveilled for months, and it, therefore, suggested collusion between the Trump people and Russia on the campaign. And now, we\u2019re told, well, that\u2019s not necessarily the case,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve got, frankly, independent FOIAs and two lawsuits designed to figure out what was going on directly,\u201d Fitton said of Judicial Watch\u2019s perspective on the controversy. \u201cI don\u2019t trust Congress to get at it directly because I think the intelligence committees, generally speaking, aren\u2019t going to really hold the intelligence agencies to account in any significant way. That\u2019s why you need an independent third party like Judicial Watch asking these questions. \u201d Marlow turned to a flurry of recent court decisions by activist judges, including a block on President Trump\u2019s executive order to suspend visas for six   nations and even a possible judicial order to double the number of refugees accepted into the United States. He noted Fitton has warned about a \u201cjudicial war\u201d against Trump. \u201cI think some judges are letting their concerns about Donald Trump get in the way of their judicial \u201d Fitton said. \u201cA lot of these decisions seem more   than a traditional judicial decision that carefully applies the law. The analysis, for instance, in the Hawaii court about Trump\u2019s concern about Islamic terrorism  \u2014   it\u2019s just one judge substituting his political judgment and policy disagreements with President Trump and mistaking that for the real law. \u201d  \u201cThis is something that judges aren\u2019t supposed to do,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou had five judges in the Ninth Circuit essentially call out their fellow colleagues on this, saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got to be careful here. We can\u2019t let our policy disagreements or our concerns one way or another for President Trump color our  .\u2019 That\u2019s pretty extraordinary to say. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s this Deep State approach in the administration, the executive agencies, and the bureaucracies. That way of thinking is infecting too many judicial decisions related to the president\u2019s executive orders,\u201d he charged. Marlow said the Deep State has been   on Breitbart News Daily in recent days. He asked Fitton for his conception of the Deep State and how much of a threat it poses to President Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s the permanent bureaucracy. It\u2019s the recent hires of President Obama, obviously. But we should recognize that individuals who are in government for 10, 20, 30 years aren\u2019t in government because they\u2019re tea partiers. They\u2019re there because they like the idea of the government, generally speaking, any more than someone\u2019s working at McDonald\u2019s for 30 years because they hate McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Fitton replied. He said these lifetime bureaucrats \u201ctend to have contempt for political appointees,\u201d especially Republican political appointees. \u201cWith Trump, there\u2019s a particular animus because they don\u2019t think Trump deserves to be president, and so they\u2019re going to fight him, and organize against him, and quote \u2018resist\u2019 him. \u201d  \u201cYou see it in this unholy alliance in the Hawaiian decision, where you have the DHS, you may recall, issues some sort of sketchy staff report undermining the president\u2019s executive orders by suggesting we don\u2019t have to worry about terrorism from these foreign countries that he\u2019s concerned about, these six or seven countries. It wasn\u2019t a final product. It wasn\u2019t approved by anyone they just leaked it, and that report is being cited by the District Court judge in Hawaii as a reason to suggest Mr. Trump\u2019s order was not valid. Isn\u2019t that convenient?\u201d Fitton said sarcastically. He said Judicial Watch was still working to resolve pending lawsuits for documents related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server and various Obama administration controversies. \u201cWe had about 60 pending against the Obama administration on Inauguration Day, and when the president raised his hand, President Trump raised his hand and took the oath, they became against the Trump administration,\u201d Fitton said.  \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for the Trump administration to come to power in many respects because currently on FOIA, nothing\u2019s changed. They\u2019re defending the Clinton emails as if Obama was running the show  \u2014   a further example of the   in place,\u201d he said. In addition to those   suits, Fitton said Judicial Watch is trying to monitor \u201clawlessness in the bureaucracies\u201d and challenge bureaucratic mischief related to immigration, such as San Francisco\u2019s \u201csanctuary city\u201d policy and \u201cthe University of California\u2019s illicit   tuition policy for illegal aliens. \u201d \u201cOn top of that, we\u2019ve got the election fraud crisis, the voter fraud crisis that the president aptly highlighted. Those battles continue in states across the nation,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe crisis caused by the Left\u2019s attack on the rule of law has not abated in significant ways, and it frankly continues,\u201d Fitton declared.
