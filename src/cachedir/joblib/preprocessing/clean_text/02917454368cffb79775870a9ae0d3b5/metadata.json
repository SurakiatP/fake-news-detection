On Monday, the performer, a Chicago native, announced that the sum would support the arts and   programming. In a news conference at Westcott Elementary School blocks away from where he grew up, he called the donation a \u201ccall to action. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m honored to make this donation to Chicago Public Schools Foundation and help cultivate Chicago creative minds,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m committed to helping Chicago\u2019s children have quality learning experiences that include the arts. \u201d His gift comes at a moment when the city is grappling with a crisis over funding its schools. The rapper, who was educated in the Chicago\u2019s public schools, had been a vocal advocate for fixing the budget issues confronting the school system, which is the nation\u2019s third largest, serving over 400, 000 students. It is facing a budget deficit that could bring an early end to the school year. Chance met on Friday with Bruce Rauner, Illinois\u2019s Republican governor, to discuss the city\u2019s schools. Afterward, Chance said he found the governor\u2019s responses to his questions \u201cvague,\u201d and he urged news outlets to explore how Chicago\u2019s school system arrived at its current state. \u201cGovernor Rauner can use his executive power to give Chicago\u2019s children the resources they need to fulfill their   right to learn,\u201d he said at a news conference. \u201cWhile I\u2019m frustrated and disappointed in the governor\u2019s inaction, that will not stop me from continuing to do all I can to support Chicago\u2019s most valuable resource: its children. \u201d A few hours before the rapper\u2019s announcement, Mr. Rauner circulated a memo proposing two plans that might help secure $215 million in funding for the city\u2019s school system. On Monday, the donation drew praise from the former first lady Michelle Obama, also a Chicago native, who on Twitter called him an \u201cexample of the power of arts education. \u201d A spokeswoman for the governor, Eleni Demertzis, said in a statement that philanthropy would not solve the schools\u2019 funding crisis. \u201cWhile the Rauners are passionate donors to our schools, individual contributions will never be enough to address the financial challenges facing C. P. S. ,\u201d Ms. Demertzis said. \u201cIt would be helpful if C. P. S. officials came to Springfield and joined in serious,   discussions about the   stability of all of our schools. \u201d Chance the Rapper\u2019s donation will be shared among 10 public elementary schools and high schools. Monique Dockery is the principal of one of the 10 schools, Westcott Elementary, which is receiving $10, 000. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, she said she was shocked to learn the news. \u201cIt just opened up a whole new world for Westcott and its students,\u201d she said. \u201cWe focus a lot on reading and math and the core subjects, and yet we have some very talented students who can go beyond that. \u201d The donation from the rapper, whose real name is Chancelor Johnathan Bennett, is funded through a portion of proceeds from ticket sales of his upcoming tour. Chance urged others to join   efforts through SocialWorks, an organization he helped create, aimed at youth empowerment. For every $100, 000 raised, the organization will award an additional $10, 000 to a specific school. The   efforts are the continuation of philanthropic and civic engagement for the rapper in his hometown. During the presidential election, he held a   drive at the Magnificent Coloring Day Festival and led a parade of early voters following a concert at Grant Park in November.'"}, "time": 1742563603.399865}
