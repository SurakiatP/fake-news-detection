Also check out the Food section\u2019s guide to French cooking and our survey of five classic specialties, from bouillabaisse to galettes.  On a Sunday afternoon, people streamed across the Place de la Com\u00e9die, a grand Haussmannian square in central Bordeaux. The crowd was diverse in age, social class and ethnicity, but, this being France, the majority wore artfully draped scarves. They rode by on public share bikes and sipped espresso at the terrace cafes on the square\u2019s southern edge, in the shadow of an elongated sculpture of a head by the contemporary Catalan artist Jaume Plensa. They clustered in pools of sunlight on the limestone steps of the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre and trickled contentedly out of Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Le Pressoir d\u2019Argent and Philippe Etchebest\u2019s Le Quatri\u00e8me Mur, part of a recent wave of   restaurant openings in this comely port city in southwestern France. As I took in the scene, it was hard to believe that not so long ago Bordeaux was considered somewhat of a backwater. Despite being one of the world\u2019s major wine industry capitals, the city was known for years as La Belle Endormie, or Sleeping Beauty, as much for the   walls of its center as for its sleepy, overlooked reputation. But in the last two decades, Bordeaux has come awake. An ambitious revitalization campaign begun in the   by Alain Jupp\u00e9, the longstanding   mayor and a former prime minister, cleaned up the city center, making it more welcoming to pedestrians. The project also established a   tram system and transformed over 7, 500, 000 square feet of former docklands into an agreeable terrain of walkways, bike paths, landscaped gardens and public waterside attractions. In 2007, half of the restored   city received Unesco recognition, making it the largest urban World Heritage site. In 2013, Bordeaux was ranked as France\u2019s   city, after Paris. Last June, the city added to its offerings La Cit\u00e9 du Vin, an ambitious new museum on the banks of the river Garonne dedicated to the history of French viticulture, and as of December, a new   train line, set to begin service this summer, will run from Gare Montparnasse in Paris to Bordeaux in just over two hours. Yet it\u2019s the food scene that has taken center stage, and today, the   heart of Bordeaux\u2019s left bank is cluttered with interesting new offerings like experimental modern bistros, elaborate sanctums of haute cuisine and cozy   gastrobars. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally new city,\u201d said   Le Bras, a chef who moved to Bordeaux last year to reopen the restaurant La Grande Maison, in a   luxury hotel, with the    French chef Pierre Gagnaire. Mr. Le Bras last spent time in the city 25 years ago, back when it was \u201cdark and dodgy,\u201d he said. Now, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s very dynamic   \u2026     there\u2019s so much to do. \u201d Owned by the French multimillionaire wine magnate Bernard Magrez, La Grande Maison opened in late 2014 in a stately   white stone mansion set back from the street by tall   gates that enclose a   circle drive and a    Andalusian olive tree. The Napoleon   interiors feature   chandeliers, opulent stone and embroidered silk. Mr. Magrez initially worked with Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, among the world\u2019s most decorated chefs, but replaced him over the summer with Mr. Gagnaire, who has redone the menu with dishes like creamed hen pheasant consomm\u00e9 with   brut Champagne, served with crispy white cabbage, prune and aloe vera, all part of a   (about $63) \u201chunting\u201d trio off the \u00e0 la carte menu. A   and   degustation costs \u20ac135 and \u20ac185. Then there\u2019s the wine list, as elaborate as one might expect from Mr. Magrez, with more than 160 chateaus and every cru class\u00e9 (a term denoting recognized,   vineyards) from the Bordeaux region. But the city\u2019s abundant food scene includes more casual offerings as well. My first stop was Garopapilles, a   restaurant and wine cellar that opened two and a half years ago on a quiet leafy street in Bordeaux\u2019s center. The chef, Tanguy Laviale, 35, presides over a small open kitchen at the end of the   dining room, which looks on a glassed inner courtyard planted with aromatic herbs. Mr. Laviale was designated a Great Chef of Tomorrow in the 2016 Gault Millau guide for his rotating, seasonally driven prix fixe \u201cmarket menu,\u2019\u2019 available Tuesday to Friday for lunch and Thursday and Friday for dinner. Lunch, including starter, main and dessert, costs \u20ac32, with optional wine pairing by the house sommelier (the   tasting dinner menu is \u20ac59). Ours began with a selection of  : bell pepper cream with feta cheese over a bed of black caviar, a clam served in the shell topped with a smoked lard emulsion foam. Then came a marbled, luscious foie gras terrine served with a bright quince pur\u00e9e, pickled porcinis and a mushroom shizu sauce, followed by veal in mushroom sauce served with tomato, oyster and wakame seaweed, a swirl of earthy complexity, finished with a dessert of delicate white cheese ice cream with mango cr\u00e8me and pumpkin espumante pur\u00e9e. Around us,   men in unbuttoned blazers and   glasses swirled glass after glass selected from the carefully curated,   wine list, knowledgeable waiters expounded on the ingredients and several young couples seemed to be Instagramming the better part of their meal. The vibe was urbane but convivial everyone appeared to be having a good time. Garopapilles is one of several modern French restaurants recently opened in Bordeaux by impressive young chefs, including locavore Belle Campagne, inside a townhouse in the city center Le Chien de Pavlov, a bistrot that has earned raves for dishes like crab and Kaffir lime ravioli and C\u00f4t\u00e9 Rue, which, since opening in July 2015 near the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Aquitaine, has become one of the hottest seats in town. C\u00f4t\u00e9 Rue\u2019s   dining room, featuring   crown molding and bold abstract oil paintings, is regularly booked by stylish locals who come for the innovative dishes like beechwood smoked beef with cinnamon leaf and foie gras with citron and Jerusalem artichoke. \u201cSo many young chefs are here in Bordeaux right now,\u201d said Rudy Ballin, 25, C\u00f4t\u00e9 Rue\u2019s head chef. \u201cThe same thing happened in Lyon 15 years ago,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone wants to move to Bordeaux because so much is happening, so there\u2019s all this young energy, and people move here, start their own businesses, try new things. \u201d A sizable segment of Bordeaux\u2019s new wave has turned east, bringing Asian influences to play on native culinary styles at relaxed neo bistros like the   restaurant Dan as well as Miles, which has attracted a cult following since opening three years ago in the center near the Place de la Bourse. Miles\u2019s experimental melding of geographical influences is inspired by the provenance of its three   from France and French Polynesia, Israel and Japan. At Miles, as at so many of Bordeaux\u2019s neo bistros, a rotating multicourse tasting menu is served from a small open kitchen: pleasingly   concoctions like hazelnut oil confit egg yolk with smoked chestnut pur\u00e9e and raw mushrooms, or sous vide monkfish with   eggplant, mussel foam and a gremolata of coconut, coriander and lime. A year ago, the team behind Miles opened a more informal restaurant nearby: Mampuku (Japanese for \u201cfull belly\u201d). Shared plates focus on the street food of the chefs\u2019 places of origin, like steamed Vietnamese bao buns stuffed with braised beef cheek and cilantro grilled and smoked eggplant with honey,   labane sauce, pomegranate and fresh herbs and \u201cSaba Tastutaage,\u201d crispy mackerel and broccoli tempura served with umeboshi, daikon radishes and a   dip. On a recent Saturday afternoon, lunch guests filled the cavernous dining room, sampling the diverse offerings over what seemed like a great many bottles of wine. You have to go farther upriver, though, to visit the city\u2019s most newsworthy gastronomical attraction: La Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum of wine and viticulture that opened in June. Designed by XTU Architects to mimic wine swirling in a glass, the shimmering      facade towers over the partially redeveloped docklands of the Bassins \u00e0 Flot district. Some seven years and $90 million in the making, La Cit\u00e9 du Vin at times seems more like a theme park than a museum. There are copious   projections, holograms, interactive elements and even a ship simulator that reimagines the maritime journeys of wine merchants throughout history. Thanks to video mapping technologies, an Armenian feast magically appears on a white table, then transforms into a traditional Jewish festive spread, as a virtual guide explains various culinary and viticultural traditions. In the \u201cgallery of civilizations,\u201d light boxes feature 3D animations tracing wine culture from ancient Greece and Egypt up to the present and a \u201cbuffet of the five senses,\u201d where visitors can test different smells by releasing them from glass cloches. There are video installations devoted to wine\u2019s role in religion, mythology, eroticism and the arts, with special attention paid to the history of viticulture in Bordeaux and the surrounding region of Aquitaine, where some of the world\u2019s best wine has been harvested for two millenniums. La Cit\u00e9 du Vin also features a wine shop with more than 800 varieties, a   auditorium and Le 7, a    fine dining restaurant. Yet Bordeaux\u2019s most enticing gastronomic attraction still may be one of its oldest: the March\u00e9 des Capucins, a huge covered food market in the heart of the multicultural St.  district that dates to the  . Known colloquially as the \u201cbelly of Bordeaux,\u201d the March\u00e9 des Capucins is a pandemonium of scents, flavors and ungentrified French charm. Under the domed roofs of adjoining market halls, locals visit the seafood stands to consume oysters and sauvignon blanc, and to inspect crates of   heirloom tomatoes and cabbages that evoke \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s account of \u201cexquisite flowery masses the color of wine, crimson and deep purple. \u201d Cheese sellers offer brusque expertise while slicing off luxurious chunks of Chaubier and Roquefort, and men drink espresso and roll cigarettes at   counters, as they have for centuries. There\u2019s nothing innovative or trendy about it, and yet here, perhaps more than anywhere in the city, you can feel that behind Bordeaux\u2019s recent culinary success is a   and enduring passion for food deep in the heart (and belly) of its inhabitants.'"}, "time": 1742628603.4801786}
