Dannel Malloy ( ) issued an executive order Thursday instructing the state department of education to develop policies with local school districts that allow gender confused children to use the school bathrooms and locker rooms of whichever gender they identify with at any given time. [According to a press release from Malloy\u2019s office, the governor and state department of education Commissioner Dianna R. Wentzell issued a memo to all Connecticut public school superintendents, referring them to former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 transgender bathroom policy for guidance until more \u201cformal guidance\u201d is developed within the state.  Malloy\u2019s executive order is in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to abandon Obama\u2019s May 2016 directive, which effectively asserts that children can change their sex by simply announcing they have the \u201cgender identity\u201d of the other sex. Trump essentially returned the issue of school bathrooms to the states. Obama\u2019s transgender bathroom policy was actually halted in August of 2016 by a U. S. district judge who said the former president had overstepped his authority in issuing the directive. The order comes \u201cin light of an action yesterday by the Trump Administration to roll back federal guidelines that protected transgender students in public school,\u201d states the press release from the governor\u2019s office. The governor said in a statement: Discrimination, harassment, and bullying have no place in our classrooms or at our schools. Despite the actions taken by the federal government yesterday, the State of Connecticut remains committed to ensuring that every student has access to a   education in a safe, supportive and welcoming school environment. Every child, no matter their gender identity or expression, should be treated equally and fairly in a safe, supportive environment. Connecticut will remain a state of inclusiveness because we strongly believe that diversity makes us stronger. Malloy, who served as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race, signed legislation in 2011 that added yet another category of a special protected class  \u2014   gender identity and expression  \u2014   into Connecticut\u2019s   statutes. Less than   of Americans support the \u201c \u201d ideology pushed by gay activists and by Obama. Policies associated with the ideology would allow transgender activists to sue   institutions  \u2014   such as sports leagues, public   and women\u2019s shelters   \u2014   until both biological sexes are viewed as interchangeable. Since the presidential election, Obama has twice admitted that his unpopular transgender policy helped to defeat Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton. In an email statement, Family Institute of Connecticut (FIC) says, \u201c[T]he governor\u2019s statement of opposition is a farce, just the typical grandstanding to his base for which he is prone. \u201d FIC continues: As White House spokesman Sean Spicer explained in his daily briefing, President Trump rescinded President Obama\u2019s transgender imposition on the nation\u2019s schools because \u201cHe just believes this is a state issue that needs to be addressed by the states. \u201d In other words, President Trump could care less whether Gov. Malloy reaffirms transgender impositions on Connecticut\u2019s schools. Trump rescinded Obama\u2019s \u201cguidelines\u201d for reasons of states\u2019 rights, the very idea Malloy appeals to in resisting Trump\u2019s immigration policies. On Wednesday, the Connecticut governor also ordered his state\u2019s law enforcement officers to refuse to comply with Trump\u2019s immigration orders and policies, urging them to bar federal immigration officials from having access to illegal immigrants. Additionally, Malloy\u2019s order encouraged schools to develop their own plans to bar access to schools by federal immigration officials. In June of 2016, Quinnipiac University released a survey that found Malloy\u2019s approval ratings had plummeted to 24 percent  \u2014   his lowest since taking office in 2011, and \u201cone of the lowest approval ratings ever recorded for a governor in any of the nine states surveyed by the Quinnipiac University Poll,\u201d reports the school. In the same month, a study from George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center found that Connecticut ranked as the state in the worst fiscal condition  \u2014   second only to Puerto Rico.'"}, "time": 1742563539.7815545}
