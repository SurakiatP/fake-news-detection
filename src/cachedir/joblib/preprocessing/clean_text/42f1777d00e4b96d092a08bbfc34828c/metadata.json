His parents and sister, Nebraskans all, were nearby on the beach at a Disney resort here, relaxing, carefree. Suddenly, an alligator sprang from the water and clamped its jaws around the boy. Lane\u2019s father, Matt Graves, bounded into the lagoon to wrestle his son from the animal\u2019s   grasp, but lost the battle, according to an account by the Orange County sheriff, Jerry L. Demings. The alligator made off with the boy, and an intense search for him yielded nothing in the wide, murky expanse of water until more than 16 hours later, early on Wednesday afternoon, when divers found him about six feet below the surface and only 10 to 15 feet from where he had last been seen. He was placed in a marine patrol boat, covered with a white sheet, and turned over to the medical examiner for an autopsy. During a news conference less than a mile from the lagoon, Sheriff Demings said that he and a Catholic priest had delivered the \u201ctough message\u201d of the boy\u2019s death to Mr. Graves, his wife, Melissa, and their    daughter, who live in the Elkhorn section of Omaha, Neb. \u201cThe family was distraught but also, I believe, relieved that we were able to find their son,\u201d said the sheriff, who noted that there was no question in his mind that \u201cthe child was drowned by the alligator. \u201d Lane had been splashing about, the sheriff said, despite a sign that said swimming was not permitted in the lagoon. His father also summoned a lifeguard from a nearby pool, but he, too, was unable to rescue the boy. The medical examiner ruled Thursday that the cause of death was drowning and traumatic injuries. In a statement on Thursday, the family expressed their appreciation for everyone involved in the search and asked for privacy. \u201cWe are devastated,\u201d the statement said. The recovery ended a search that began shortly after 9 p. m. on Tuesday in the lagoon at Disney\u2019s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. The artificial lake, which covers about 200 acres, is 14 feet deep in parts and feeds a series of canals that wind through the Disney complex. It lies across from the Magic Kingdom theme park. Alligators are a common sight in Florida ponds, lakes, lagoons and canals. The sheriff said five alligators were taken from the lagoon after the boy went under. They have been euthanized to determine if any of them killed the boy. Sheriff Demings noted that Disney had been in business in the area for 45 years and had never had a similar incident, and that no \u201cnuisance alligators\u201d had been reported in the area recently. \u201cEveryone here at the Walt Disney World Resort is devastated by this tragic accident,\u201d Jacquee Wahler, vice president of the Walt Disney World Resort, said in a statement. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family. We are helping the family and doing everything we can to assist law enforcement. \u201d Ms. Wahler said on Thursday that the beaches at the resort were closed and would remain   to guests. \u201cWe are conducting a swift and thorough review of our processes and protocols,\u201d she said. \u201cThis includes the number, placement and wording of our signage and warnings. \u2019\u2019 The resort has a wildlife management team that monitors alligators and other animals and regularly removes any that appear to be troublesome, according to Nick Wiley, executive director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. He said that alligator attacks were \u201cnot common at all\u201d but that alligators were capable of moving across land and underwater so fencing them off was not a feasible option. But some visitors to the resort on Wednesday said Disney could have done more to protect the child and other visitors beyond simply posting the \u201cNo Swimming\u201d signs that dot the periphery of Seven Seas Lagoon and others like it. \u201cDisney should always have these lakes patrolled, with all the money they\u2019re making,\u201d Jerome Powell, a hotel concierge who works for a Disney competitor, said as he waited for a shuttle bus near the Magic Kingdom. \u201cThat alligator should never have been in that water. For the alligator to be able to walk right out of the lagoon and grab that child, that\u2019s crazy. \u201d Kaitlynn Michaud, 16, from Ellington, Conn. who was visiting with her mother, Kim, said a mere \u201cNo swimming\u201d sign \u201cisn\u2019t really helpful enough\u201d when alligators were known to be part of the natural population. \u201cYou can still be near the water,\u201d she said, \u201cand get into trouble. \u201d Thomas Scolaro, a partner at the Miami law firm Leesfield Scolaro, which has represented families after alligator attacks elsewhere, said that in this case, \u201cthe facts look horrible for Disney. \u201d \u201cWhile this is a tragedy, it was entirely preventable had Disney acted reasonably and not left unwitting tourists at the mercy of dangerous and wild animals that roam its resort,\u201d he said. The child\u2019s death was another blow to an area already on edge after the shootings at an Orlando nightclub early on Sunday and the murder two days earlier of a popular singer. A state tourism official did not respond to a request for comment. Wildlife experts estimate that there are 1. 3 million alligators in Florida, and that they can be found in all 67 counties. They prefer freshwater lakes and   rivers and their associated wetlands, but they can also be found in brackish water habitats, said Tammy Sapp, a spokeswoman for the state fish and wildlife commission. \u201cAnywhere there is standing water, an alligator might be found,\u201d she said, Last year, the Central Florida area had its first reported fatal alligator attack since 2007. The body of a swimmer, James Okkerse, 61, of DeBary, Fla. was pulled from a lake in Volusia County, north of Orlando, and it was determined that he had been attacked by a   gator. Also last year, a    man who authorities said was fleeing a burglary was killed by an alligator in Brevard County, east of Orlando. The man, Matthew Riggins, drowned, the sheriff\u2019s office said, and his body showed signs of having been mauled. Ed Frank, visiting from Charlotte, N. C. with his wife and two sons, said Wednesday that he was sure the Graveses had been careful. \u201cBut we\u2019re in Florida, and there are alligators in bodies of water,\u201d he said. \u201cAlligators in their natural environment are good at camouflage. It\u2019s what they do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628398.3480833}
