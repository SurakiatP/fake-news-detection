Refugee Admissions Program is like \u201cplaying with fire\u201d and will \u201cworsen\u201d America\u2019s war against terrorists. [\u201cShutting our door to refugees or discriminating among them is not our way, and does not make us safer,\u201d Jolie wrote in an   published Thursday in the New York Times. \u201cActing out of fear is not our way. Targeting the weakest does not show strength. \u201d  Jolie, who serves as special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, says \u201cthe lesson of the years we have spent fighting terrorism since Sept. 11 is that every time we depart from our values we worsen the very problem we are trying to contain. \u201d President Trump\u2019s order suspended the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days and bars refugees from failed terror   coming into the United States during that period. A review of the refugee vetting process is now underway. While never mentioning Trump\u2019s name, Jolie rebukes the president\u2019s refuge order calling it a departure from \u201cour country\u2019s history of giving shelter to the most vulnerable people. Americans have shed blood to defend the idea that human rights transcend culture, geography, ethnicity and religion. \u201d While acknowledging Trump\u2019s pledge to protect America from its enemies around the world, Jolie says the president\u2019s action \u201cmust be measured and should be based on facts, not fear. \u201d \u201cIf we send a message that it is acceptable to close the door to refugees, or to discriminate among them on the basis of religion, we are playing with fire. We are lighting a fuse that will burn across continents, inviting the very instability we seek to protect ourselves against,\u201d the Academy Award winner writes. Last May, Jolie criticized Trump after he proposed his plan to temporarily halt entry for nationals from countries fraught with terror. \u201cTo me, America is built on people from around the world coming together for freedoms, especially freedom of religion,\u201d Jolie said. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard to hear this is coming from someone who is pressing to be an American president\u201d While the Maleficent star continues to condemn Trump\u2019s policies, her father actor John Voight is a fierce supporter.
