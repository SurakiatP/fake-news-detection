The court found no evidence that the Rev. Rom\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez had sexually abused one of his former altar boys more than a decade ago. An investigation began after David Ram\u00edrez Castillo wrote to Pope Francis in 2014, detailing the sexual abuse that he said he and others suffered repeatedly when they were teenagers at the hands of a group of priests led by Father Mart\u00ednez. Pope Francis phoned Mr. Ram\u00edrez Castillo and urged him to pursue his complaints. The pope also ordered a church investigation into the case, demanding complete transparency. In an   ruling, the court said it had exonerated Father Mart\u00ednez not only because of the lack of evidence against him but also because the testimony of Mr. Ram\u00edrez Castillo included elements that were \u201ccompletely implausible. \u201d The court listed several events and details provided by Mr. Ram\u00edrez Castillo that could not be corroborated or proved false. For instance, there was no birthmark on Father Mart\u00ednez\u2019s genitals, contrary to what Mr. Ram\u00edrez Castillo had claimed. The priest\u2019s lawyer, Javier Muriel, said the verdict showed the case was based on lies. \u201cIt is easy to make an accusation of pedophilia, a crime that happens in privacy and in which the testimony of the victim is really the only proof,\u201d Mr. Muriel said. Mr. Ram\u00edrez Castillo and his lawyer did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The case could still be appealed to the Spanish Supreme Court. The archdiocese of Granada welcomed the ruling on Tuesday. In a statement, it noted \u201cthe suffering that this case has caused, within the diocese but in reality within the whole church. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562135.4218144}
