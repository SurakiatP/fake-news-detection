This is such a thread. Some opinions we agree with, some we don\u2019t. But they all add an edge to this topic. \u2014The Editors \\nMMChomek \u2022 16 hours ago Alright, let\u2019s sum this up. \\nHillary can\u2019t launch a No fly zone over Syria, because there is already one in place? Well, the point they are trying to make is that they will get rid of the Russian and Syrian air defenses to launch their own \u201cWe can fly-you can\u2019t-zone\u201d. With force. Hillary expressed her willingness to do this several times already. \\nYes, General Dunford said \u201cwe would have to go to war with Syria and Russia\u201d You kind of left out the followup, where he says \u201cThat is a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I\u2019m not going to make\u201d not, \u201cwe can\u2019t do this\u201d e.g, he\u2019s waiting for the order from the commander in chief. \\nThis was at the very beginning of the article >She is fully supported by virtually the whole US establishment; a bipartisan, neocon/neoliberalcon, regime change/\u201dhumanitarian\u201d imperialist axis. \\nSo WHO is going to stop her? \\nand lastly, first finished Sarmat won\u2019t be slipped inside a silo at least until late 2018 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February kind of a non-sequitur to even mention it \\nSo you basically say \u201cThis is why Hillary won\u2019t start WWIII\u201d and then you throw in a bunch of non-arguments and contradictions \\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 \\nMike John Elissen MMChomek \u2022 8 hours ago `and lastly, first finished Sarmat won\u2019t be slipped inside a silo at least until late 2018 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February kind of a non-sequitur to even mention it` \\nfollowed by `So you basically say \u201cThis is why Hillary won\u2019t start WWIII\u201d and then you throw in a bunch of non-arguments and contradictions` Seems to me the only `non-argumentation` is your view on Billary taking control next year and immediately starting WW3. Even for a war-loving US hawk like her, it will take time to start a war with Russia. \\nMMChomek Mike John Elissen \u2022 8 hours ago God, Hillary doesn\u2019t even need to be president to lobby for war. She\u2019s been doing exactly that for three straight decades. Now she has full support of entire D.C behind her back. Even as Kjell mentions one or two good, down to earth generals in Pentagon are not going to be enough, when most of their colleagues lobby for spending and interventions hoping to end up as senior advisors for defense contractor giants. Entire DC, even bah, especially the \u201cprogressive think tanks\u201d (who get funded by things like Lockheed Martin and even Saudi Arabia) is crying for cruise missile strikes on Syria as we speak. \\nMike John Elissen MMChomek \u2022 6 hours ago Your argumentation for calling Escobar`s points `non-arguments` is, or rather was ao the fact HRC takes office in january (not february as you claimed) 2017, and the new Sarmat will be in service in 2018. To change the subject (Clinton&Co warmongering and making profits \u2013 we all know that) does not change the fact Billary needs time to prepare for a war with Russia. You can call Kjell as a `rescue line` all you want, fact remains your own argumentation is `Non`. \\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 Kjell Hasthi MMChomek \u2022 16 hours ago \u2013 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February Pepe did not say that \\nNeil Tana Kjell Hasthi \u2022 7 hours ago She will. Trump is an idiot and is probably acting that way to drive another agenda because he can\u2019t be that stupid. The real questions is how serious is all of this to Russia. I think it is very serious. The US has already shown how they manipulate people to wage war against their government, supply them with weapons, call it a civil war, plant false flags to push it over the edge, call it unhumanitarian to open air war options, then invite others to join in on the fun while selling them weapons in the process to do so. They can easily do this to Russia if Syria falls or not. They just need to excite the 20 million muslims in Russia that borders the middle east. I\u2019d say that Russia is a great risk and should take decisive actions. They could just use air fuel bombs as they are not radioactive but destroy everything in its path like a tactical nuke. To this point, the EU needs to be very worried because they are on the front lines and are sleep walking under the direction of the US who is an ocean away. \\nKjell Hasthi MMChomek \u2022 14 hours ago \u2013 As I said before, I don\u2019t believe Trump will win \\nThat is naiv as both Hillary and Kaine are unpopular. In Pentagon, almost hated. \\nMMChomek Kjell Hasthi \u2022 14 hours ago How is that possible? She is their major job provider. \\nKjell Hasthi MMChomek \u2022 14 hours ago There are 90 million made redundant Trump is a more attractive candidate for them The polls presented on telly are all manipulated (when compared to independent polls). Hillary is well behind, and she is losing voters these days. The Putin bashing did not save her. \\nMMChomek Kjell Hasthi \u2022 14 hours ago Trump has wowed to pull out of middle east, stop babysitting and subsidizing other NATO members and become buddies with the \u201cgreatest existential threat\u201d e.g Russia \\nHow is he a more attractive candidate for the Pentagon, than Hillary who\u2019s seeking armed confrontation everywhere? \\nKjell Hasthi MMChomek \u2022 14 hours ago Trump presents the Globalists as an existential threat, and this election as the most important in human history. It is about saving humanity. \\nMMChomek Kjell Hasthi \u2022 14 hours ago I understand and agree, now please try to fit what you\u2019ve just said into your previous post about Trump being the more attractive choice for the Pentagon, because I\u2019m lost here. \\nKjell Hasthi MMChomek \u2022 14 hours ago That is new. Some group of (4 stars?) general approached Trump and asked him to be candidate. Their arguments were about stopping madman Hillary. Trump said yes to them \\nMMChomek Kjell Hasthi \u2022 14 hours ago So there is an actual anti-war faction inside the Pentagon? That sounds too good to be true. Most of those guys lobby war like madmen, because they get lucrative advisor contracts with defense industries after they retire. Isn\u2019t it just some hearsay? \\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 \\ndan kopfz MMChomek \u2022 11 hours ago Unlike the psychopaths in the white house, the vast majority of the military leadership are not completely insane, and would not meekly follow orders when those orders would mean the lives of millions of Americans. \\nShould Hillary push for a no-fly zone, it\u2019s not the Russians she\u2019d need to worry about\u2013it\u2019s a military coup. As everyone knows, in a military coup, you eliminate the current leadership. \\ndan kopfz dan kopfz \u2022 11 hours ago There\u2019s another reality that the military would be taking into account, that mad Hillary probably wouldn\u2019t. \\nChina is not stupid. \\nAn empire doesn\u2019t get to be 8000+ years old by making miscalculations. China knows that if the US is willing to commit to a hot war with Russia, than they\u2019d be next if the US won. That means the Chinese would be looking to make sure that the US doesn\u2019t win, and given the current tensions in the South China, might join the war on Russia\u2019s side as a full ally, openly declaring war against the US. \\nWithout going nuclear, in an open hot war against China and Russia (and Syria, and Iran, and others), NATO can\u2019t win. The Pentagon won\u2019t make that miscalculation either. \\nPeter Jennings \u2022 14 hours ago The US have been fighting lame armies filled with soldiers who would rather be somewhere else. Tending to their crops or animals for example. \\nAfghanistan isn\u2019t going as expected. Libya isn\u2019t going as expected. Iraq isn\u2019t going as expected. In Syria they have got bogged down, exposing their proxy war to all, when it was initially advertising as \u2018humanitarian intervention\u2019. \\nWhen it comes to Russia, a determined, battle hardened, well trained army with highly advanced weapons, the US will resemble europe during the last world war. Vote in a warmonger, you will get war, that\u2019s where they get their kicks. \\nStevenStarr \u2022 14 hours ago Wishful thinking. \\nrichardstevenhack \u2022 4 hours ago Apparently both Alexander Mercouris and Pepe Escobar have succumbed to what is known as \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d\u2013 the attitude that because something would be impossible to accept, it therefore is impossible to happen. \\nWhile I would expect some members of the Pentagon to school Clinton on the problems of establishing a no-fly-zone in Syria once she is elected, the fact remains that there is no reason to believe she will accept that position. \\nAs I\u2019ve said before, the goal of the Syria crisis is to set the preconditions for a long war with IRAN. First Syria\u2019s military has to be degraded, then Israel (and possibly NATO) will attack Hizballah in Lebanon into the Bekaa Valley via Syrian territory. Then and only then can Israel initiate a war with Iran, having more or less \u201cdisarmed\u201d Iran\u2019s allies right next to Israel. \\nIf Israel wants to achieve its goal of taking Iran out of the Middle East picture, and the US military-industrial complex wants to achieve its goal of an expensive, profitable, decades long war with Iran, then Syria has to go. Which means that there will be no let-up in pushing for that result. \\nAnd we all know Hillary Clinton is TOTALLY on board with both aims as a warmongering neocon. \\nDid the Bush neocons fail to get the Iraq and Afghan wars started? \\nWhy, then, should be assume, as Alexander and Pepe do, that Hillary Clinton cannot override any Pentagon reluctance and get a war with Syria started, regardless of the enhanced difficulties presented by the presence of Russia? \\nObama was prepared to go to war with Syria in August, 2013. While Russia was not present at the time to make that a more difficult proposition, it proves that the US IS spoiling for war with Syria. The three UNSC Resolutions submitted by the US early on with Chapter 7 language in them to justify such a war were only vetoed by Russia and China, burned on Libya. They prove the US goal is war with Syria. \\nThe US is not going to back down just because Russia presents a greater difficulty. Many in the Beltway really believe that if the US attacks, Russia will back down. They are probably wrong, but it will be a little late to find out once the war starts. \\nFor another thing, the notion that doubling down on supplying weapons such as MANPADs to the insurgents will change the situation is ridiculous \u2013 and the Pentagon will inform her of that, too. Which leaves her with only one option: a direct US/NATO attack on Syria. \\nShort of a straight-up Pentagon revolt, Clinton can and probably will start a war with Syria and Russia.'"}, "time": 1742628598.6300986}
