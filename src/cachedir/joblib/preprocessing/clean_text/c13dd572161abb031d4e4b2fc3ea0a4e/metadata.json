Palmieri leveled these criticisms despite her role in the Clinton team\u2019s constant efforts to delegitimize the president by making claims about alleged Russian interference in the election. [Palmieri, who served as the communications director for the Clinton campaign, told the New York Times in a weekend article that Trump\u2019s tweeting after his firing of FBI Director James Comey shows he is \u201cmore preoccupied\u201d with the Russia controversy than once thought.  \u201cWhat we\u2019ve really learned is either he\u2019s worried about Russia because he\u2019s got a significant vulnerability or he\u2019s worried about Russia because it undermines his electoral win,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly been more preoccupied with it than we understood. \u201d Later in the article, Palmieri expressed shock about Trump\u2019s frequent references to his   win in November. \u201cIt is remarkable,\u201d she said. \u201cHas there been a president ever who\u2019s been that obsessed about proving that he\u2019s legitimate?\u201d Yet Palmieri\u2019s remarks, and the Times\u2019 reporting, ignores the role Palmieri  \u2014   as well as others on the Clinton campaign team  \u2014   have played in trying to delegitimize Trump\u2019s election.  The recent book on the failed Clinton campaign, Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s Doomed Campaign, documents that the narrative of how Russia was partly to blame for Clinton\u2019s loss was formulated within 24 hours of Clinton\u2019s concession. That narrative has been peddled by Clinton aides and media outlets ever since. Just last week, Clinton campaign chair, John Podesta, tweeted out a video claiming to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between Russia and Trump. Palmieri retweeted the rambling   minute video complete with meandering spider diagrams: Watch this: https:  .   \u2014   Jennifer Palmieri (@jmpalmieri) May 12, 2017,  On Friday, the Washington Post published an   by Podesta, which called for the firing of Trump\u2019s top aides who refuse to speak \u201ctruth to power,\u201d and called for \u201ca special counsel to investigate Russia\u2019s interference in our election, possible collusion by the Trump campaign, and Trump\u2019s ongoing attempts to interfere in the investigation. \u201d That   was tweeted twice by Palmieri, the second time with the caption \u201cSo good, had to retweet again. \u201d  In March, Palmieri wrote a piece for the Washington Post, ominously titled \u201cThe Clinton campaign warned you about Russia. But nobody listened to us\u201d: Now that Trump is president, though, the stakes are higher, because the Russian plot succeeded. The lessons we campaign officials learned in trying to turn the Russia story against Trump can help other Democrats  (and all Americans) figure out how to treat this interference no longer as a matter of electoral politics but as the threat to the republic that it really is. At an event in New York in May, Clinton herself blamed Russia for her election woes. While saying she took responsibility for her election defeat, she then blamed that defeat on alleged Russian interference in the election, as well as Comey\u2019s actions related to the FBI\u2019s investigation into her private email use. \u201cI was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey\u2019s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off,\u201d she said. At that event, she also described herself as \u201cpart of the resistance\u201d  \u2014   not something that someone who believed the occupant of the White House is legitimate would normally say.
