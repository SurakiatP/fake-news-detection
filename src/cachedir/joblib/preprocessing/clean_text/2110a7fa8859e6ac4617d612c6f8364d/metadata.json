[Building the Wall, written by Tony   playwright Robert Schenkkan, is closing a month early, the play\u2019s producer Jeffrey Richards told the New York Times.   Schenkkan took to Twitter Friday to announce the play\u2019s \u201cfinal performances this weekend,\u201d ahead of its original July 9 end date: Final performances this weekend for @BLDGtheWallNYC   at New @newworldstages! Come see @TheRealTTunie and @JamesBadgeDale burn it up!  \u2014   ROBERT SCHENKKAN (@ROBERTSCHENKKAN) June 2, 2017,  The political thriller, according to the Times, follows a history professor named Gloria (Tamara Tunie) who interviews a former security officer named Rick (James Badge Gale). It\u2019s 2019, and President Donald Trump has been removed from office after a terrorist attack in Times Square forces him to declare martial law and place Muslims and Mexicans in containment camps  \u2014   which eventually turn into killing chambers. Gloria visits Rick in prison, where he explains his hand in the deadly terror. The play received a series of negative reviews, which Richards said contributed to its early shutdown. \u201cOur author built a powerful play however, during this Tony Awards season and during a season which has not been kind to straight plays, we were unable to build an audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is especially difficult to do so when you are Off Broadway. \u201d One Times review said the \u201chastily\u201d written play \u201chobbles\u201d along, crippled by \u201cfamiliar ideas\u201d like a prison interview. Schenkkan, who has been openly critical of President Trump, says the   play took him just one week to write in what he described as a \u201c  fury\u201d after the election. \u201cWe no longer live in a world that is business as usual \u2014  Trump has made that very clear \u2014  and if theater is going to remain relevant, we must become faster to respond,\u201d Schenkkan told the Times. \u201cWe cannot hope to be useful if we can\u2019t respond until 18 months after the fact. \u201d Despite its early closing, Richards said the play has been extended in Los Angeles, and there are new production rehearsals underway in Chicago, Miami, and Santa Fe. Other productions have been scheduled for Austria, Canada, Iran, and Mexico. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.'"}, "time": 1742563701.7449467}
