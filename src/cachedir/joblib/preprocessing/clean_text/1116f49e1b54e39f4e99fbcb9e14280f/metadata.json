If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts  reform.  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017,  Where are @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador? #RepealANDReplace #Obamacare,  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017,  Limbaugh mentioned a Politico story describing the House Freedom Caucus leadership as \u201cringleaders\u201d before saying there was a better way to handle the House Freedom Caucus than calling them out on Twitter. \u201cNow, to this health care business. As I mentioned earlier today, the president has doubled down on the Freedom Caucus, the 30 or so members of the conservative members of the House of Representatives, The Politico and such others in their headline are referring to the three Freedom Caucus leaders as the ringleaders, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Raul Labrador. The ringleaders? What do you associate ringleaders with? Ringleaders  \u2014   crime, gangs,\u201d he said. \u201cExactly right. Bank robbers. The ringleaders of the group were hiding in the getaway car parked one block down the street. \u201d \u201cSo now these guys are being characterized as ringleaders of some gang, some    gang in the House, and Trump has doubled down on it,\u201d Limbaugh continued. \u201cLook, folks, calling them out like this, I know it\u2019s Trump\u2019s technique I know it\u2019s Trump\u2019s method. But there\u2019s a better way of doing this. These guys are not the enemy. The Democrats are the enemy. The Freedom Caucus has actually made a pretty big move here. \u201d Limbaugh went on to cite a Washington Examiner editorial calling the Freedom Caucus\u2019 conditions reasonable and urging the White House, House Speaker Paul Ryan and congressional GOP centrists to accept those conditions. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with the first effort: It didn\u2019t kill the law,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cIt sustained much of it and then put in the hands of the secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, the responsibility of removing a bunch of things from it. And the Freedom Caucus said, \u2018We\u2019re not really getting rid of it, if we\u2019re just letting the secretary remove it and nothing else happens, then the next time the Democrats win they can put those things back in. We need to take them out by statute. \u2019\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that the objective here was to get a win,\u201d he added. \u201cThe objective was to really knock it out of the park in the first two months, fulfill a campaign promise, say that Obamacare had been repealed and the replace effort was underway, first phase of three. But the ringleaders of the Conservative Caucus were suspicious that this was not gonna end Obamacare, and they had campaigned promising to do so. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563141.104778}
