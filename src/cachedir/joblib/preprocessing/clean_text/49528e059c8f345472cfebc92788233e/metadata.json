You know the one you wore when you couldn\u2019t walk up the steps without assistance back in February? The suit that is in the viral photo that adds to the speculation that not all is well with your health? \\nVia TruthAndAction \\n\\nA private fundraiser was held at the house of Lisa and Joseph Rice in Charleston, SC. A picture of Hillary needing strong-armed assistance to walk up several steps has given more visual evidence that something is seriously wrong with Hillary.\\nScroll Down For Video Evidence Below! Her health appears to be a very real issue, with brain glitches that result in confused speech and disconnected thoughts, the inability to walk unassisted at times, and her chronic cough. However, Hillary will become president, even if it kills her, and it appears with her health issues becoming less easy to hide from the public, it will kill her.\\nThough her doctor, Dr. Bardack, gave her a clean bill of health back on July 28, 2015 in a letter stating she was fit to run for president, her behavior suggests otherwise. A neurologist, viewing the recent health issues displayed by Hillary, such as her exceptionally long bathroom break during the debate, suggests that Clinton is demonstrating signs of post-concussion syndrome. This disorder can \u201cseverely impact her cognitive abilities\u201d\\nCheck out the video that shows the bulges on her back under that bright green pantsuit on the next page. Some suggest that it is a life saving vest. What do you think? Is Hillary wearing a flack jacket under her pantsuit or is there something else that she hiding from the world? As more evidence accumulates, from brain glitches to extraordinarily long bathroom breaks, the DNC will eventually have to address her health issues one would think.\\nNow there is the mystery of the bulge under the green jacket she was wearing when she was unable to walk up the steps at a North Carolina fundraiser. As a reminder, Hillary suffered from blood clots in 2012. Could this bulge under her jacket be a LifeVest Wearable Defibrillator?\\nIn 2012, Hillary suffered from a \u201ctransverse sinus thrombosis [blood clot] is a rare condition of a clot forming in the venous sinus cavities surrounding the brain,\u201d Kassicieh told Breitbart, that resulted after Hillary\u2019s fall.\\nThese venous sinuses drain blood out of the brain. The [injury] incidence is only about 3 per 1,000,000 adults. The transverse sinus is less commonly affected than the main sagittal venous sinus. The cause of transverse sinus clots is not well understood although trauma and dehydration have been described as risk factors. Mrs. Clinton suffered from both.\\nIf her seizure like episodes are tied to an impaired heart, than the bulges could be the LifeVest.\\nHere\u2019s a video of the fundraiser event in the Rices\u2019 home. Pay special attention to Hillary\u2019s back in the beginning of the video: \\nDid you notice those strange bulges on her upper back, although she was wearing a roomy coat-jacket?\\nHere\u2019s a screenshot from the video, with painted red arrows pointing to the bulges:\\n\\nBelow are more (cropped) screenshots I took from the video. I highlighted the bulges with yellow arrows and circles:\\n\\nJim Hoft of Gateway Pundit thinks Hillary\u2019s bulges are from a defibrillator vest.\\nFrom the website Zoll.LifeVest :\\nWhat Is the LifeVest Wearable Defibrillator?\\nThe LifeVest wearable defibrillator is a treatment option for sudden cardiac arrest that offers patients advanced protection and monitoring as well as improved quality of life.\\nThe LifeVest is the first wearable defibrillator . Unlike an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), the LifeVest is worn outside the body rather than implanted in the chest. This device continuously monitors the patient\u2019s heart with dry, non-adhesive sensing electrodes to detect life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms. If a life-threatening rhythm is detected, the device alerts the patient prior to delivering a treatment shock, and thus allows a conscious patient to delay the treatment shock. If the patient becomes unconscious, the device releases a Blue\u2122 gel over the therapy electrodes and delivers an electrical shock to restore normal rhythm.\\nThose strange bulges on her back add to the many indicators of Hillary Clinton\u2019s ill health (see links below) which the mainstream media continue to dismiss . Presidential candidates are required by law to release their medical records. It is high time for Hillary to do so.\\nPause the video at 13 seconds and check out the bulge.\\n'"}, "time": 1742628433.2047088}
