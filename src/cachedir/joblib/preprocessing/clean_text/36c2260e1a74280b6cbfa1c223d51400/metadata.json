I appreciate that some have taken the view that this was a false comment. That is not my intent. That is not correct. \u201d  Sessions said, \u201cFirst, about the comments that I made to the committee that have been said to be incorrect and false. Let me be clear, I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign, and the idea that I was part of a, quote, \u2018continuing exchange of information, during the campaign, between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government\u2019 is totally false. That is the question that Senator [Al] Franken ( ) asked me at the hearing, and that\u2019s what got my attention, as he noticed it  \u2014   noted, it was the first  \u2014   just breaking news, and it got my attention, and that is the question I responded to.

I will write the Judiciary Committee soon, today or tomorrow, to explain this testimony for the record. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561796.7455654}
