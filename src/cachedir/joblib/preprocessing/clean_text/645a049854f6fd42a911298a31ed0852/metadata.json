Having already acquired a reputation for leaving children unattended, Mr. Gove has shown gross negligence by allowing a Boris to play with flammable items such as matches, Brexit negotiations and the nuclear launch codes. \\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, age 52 \u00be, is best described as \u2018an awkward child\u2019 and whose clumsy antics on zip wires and with women not his wife, are well-documented. Staff at the Foreign Office attest to seeing Mr. Johnson wandering around in his pyjamas and in a confused state, asking: \u2018What\u2019s Article 50? Where\u2019s Nanny? And who\u2019s up for some rumpy pumpy?\u2019 \\nWhile the law does allow for a man-child of Boris\u2019 age to be left unattended, the Animals Act 1971 makes Mr. Gove \u2018strictly liable\u2019 for any damage caused. An NSPCC spokesman said: \u2018You wouldn\u2019t leave a dog unattended for an extended period of time and the same applies to Boris. A dog would quickly get destressed, start defecating and gnawing at his own balls\u2026and the same applies to Boris\u2019. \\nNSPCC guidelines suggest that someone unable to find a hair brush in the morning, would struggle in an emergency or with interacting someone \u2018a bit ethnic\u2019. In the meantime Mr. Johnson is being sheltered in Battersea Dogs Home until he can be properly house-trained; staff commented: \u2018Boris isn\u2019t just for Xmas or the referendum \u2013 he\u2019s going to chewing up the furniture and UK trade agreements for years to come\u2019.   31st, 2016 by Wrenfoe   Wrenfoe   Politics'"}, "time": 1742563618.432839}
