[The Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law filed the lawsuit after the NYPD allegedly refused to comply with a Freedom of Information Law request.  \u201cAs of 2016, the NYPD is reported to have conducted \u20188, 500 facial recognition investigations, yielding 3, 000 possible matches, and leading to almost 2, 000 arrests.\u2019 In January 2016, the Center sent a FOIL request to the NYPD seeking records relating to the department\u2019s acquisition and use of face recognition technology,\u201d explained the group in a press release. \u201cDespite extensive evidence of an advanced and frequently used face recognition system, the NYPD disclosed only a single document responsive to the request for procedures relating to facial recognition technology. The department refused to disclose contract and purchasing records, and claimed that no other records could be found. \u201d Despite the fact that there are currently no laws against the use of facial recognition by law enforcement in New York, the Center claims that it is illegal for the NYPD to keep the records surrounding it from the public. \u201cFace recognition is too powerful, and its price on privacy and civil liberties too high, to not be controlled by robust policies and training guides,\u201d said the Center\u2019s Clare Garvie, who filed the original request. \u201cIf these records do in fact exist, it is against both New York law and the interests of the public to keep them secret. \u201d \u201cThe NYPD has been using face recognition for over five years. New Yorkers have a right to know how it\u2019s using face recognition technology,\u201d added David Vladeck, the Faculty Director of the Center. \u201cThe department\u2019s claim that it cannot find any records about its use of the technology is deeply troubling. \u201d \u201cIf no records exist, that means that there are no controls on the use of face recognition technology and we ought to worry about that,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf there are records, then why did the Police Department say that it couldn\u2019t find them? The lawsuit we\u2019ve filed aims to get to the bottom of those questions. \u201d The lawsuit can be viewed in full online. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
