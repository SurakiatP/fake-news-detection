As the rescuers approached, they found overloaded wooden vessels and rafts that evoked scenes of the slave trade. Hundreds of African migrants were crammed into boats headed for Italy. More than two dozen people were dead in one boat alone, asphyxiated from the crush aboard. In other boats, bodies were splayed on the floorboards, forcing survivors to clamber over the corpses of their fellow voyagers. Aris Messinis, an Agence   photographer aboard the rescue boat Astral, said it was like nothing he had ever seen. The passengers  \u2014   from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Nigeria and other   countries  \u2014   were found by the Astral on Tuesday, part of a wave of more than 11, 000 rescued in the Mediterranean by aid groups and the Italian Coast Guard this week. Migrants aboard a large wooden boat, which may have held 1, 000 people  \u2014   roughly five times its capacity  \u2014   waited frantically for help. Some jumped into the water. Even with life jackets tossed to them, migrants struggled to reach the Astral and other rescue vessels, which later transferred them to Italian Coast Guard ships bound for Italy. Pandemonium punctuated the rescue operation, despite efforts by the Astral crew to calm the migrants. \u201cThese people were in panic,\u201d Mr. Messinis said. Migrants aboard the wooden vessel included infants, like the one below. In one of the boats, holding roughly 150 people, Mr. Messinis said that rescuers found 29 bodies  \u2014   10 men and 19 women. \u201cThey told us these people were dead from the night,\u201d he said. At one point, passengers held a child aloft to signal rescuers of their desperation. Migrants crammed below deck were packed so tightly they struggled to get out. \u201cMany of them haven\u2019t seen the sea in their whole lives,\u201d said Laura Lanuza, a spokeswoman for Proactiva Open Arms, a Spanish aid group that operates the Astral. Despite a drop in sea crossings to Europe by migrants this year, more than 3, 000 have died in perilous crossings from Libya, where political chaos has made it the main departure point for smuggling operators who care little about whether their clients survive. Rescue officials attributed the spike in sea crossings in recent days to a stretch of good weather after days of storms and sea turbulence. The wooden vessel\u2019s cargo hold contained   of the roughly 1, 000 people found aboard, Ms. Lanuza said, calling the conditions \u201cjust like a slavery boat  \u2014   the same. \u201d After the living were rescued, Astral crew members put the dead in body bags and stored them in life rafts. Migration officials and rescue groups in Europe say the migrant route from North Africa remains the deadliest. Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said at least 38 migrant bodies were recovered in Mediterranean rescues Monday and Tuesday, including those found by the Astral. Mr. Messinis, 39, who has covered the conflicts in Libya and Syria, has been photographing the European migration crisis since it began three years ago. He has often put aside his camera to help rescuers. What he witnessed on the Mediterranean, he said, was different. The analogy to slave ships that once plied the Atlantic, he said, was \u201cexactly right  \u2014   except that it\u2019s not hundreds of years ago. \u201d \u201dI\u2019ve seen a lot of death, but not this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is shocking and this is what makes you feel you are not living in a civilized world. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563336.8417928}
