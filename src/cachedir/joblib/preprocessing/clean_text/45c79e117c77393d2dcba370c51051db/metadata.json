It may well be Donald J. Trump, but further due diligence is required to ensure that American democracy is not threatened.\u201d \\n21st Century Wire says\u2026 \\nAlthough the election was called on Nov 8th, the Democratic Party\u2019s ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming President is still ongoing. \\nFor those of us with long enough memories, the Democratic Party, their media operatives and the Clinton Campaign were claiming that Trump and the GOP would be engaged in this very same behavior after Hillary Clinton won the Presidency (as expected). \\nNotice how the shoe is now on the other foot. \\nIt\u2019s interesting reading past stories by \u2018news\u2019 sources linked to the Clinton Campaign and John Podesta as Politico has, who ran a feature on Aug 16th entitled, \u201cWhy the GOP Will Never Accept President Hillary Clinton\u201d which lays out the case of Hillary\u2019s lock on the White House and how the evil Republicans will not accept her eventual election victory. \\n\u201cWill Donald Trump respect the peaceful transition of power?\u201d howled CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer in the run-up to the election. The question now is: will the Democrats respect the result, and simply \u201cMove On,\u201d as they say? \\nOf course, we now know that \u2018journalists\u2019 like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign . \\nAs it turns out, the only thing illegitimate about the 2016 Election\u2026 was the mainstream corporate media. \\nMore form the Guardian\u2026 \\nThe Guardian \\nA growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers. \\nThe loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved. \\nThe document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in verifying the vote,\u201d said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting. \u201cWe need to have post-election ballot audits.\u201d Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement. \\nA second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan\u2019s center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons. \\nIn a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts,\u201d he said. \\nThe developments follow Clinton\u2019s surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election\u2026 \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files'"}, "time": 1742561724.9176426}
