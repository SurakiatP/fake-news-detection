The    shopping mall, tourist trap and TV set had been transformed into the unlikely plotting ground for the nation\u2019s immediate future. It was anybody\u2019s guess what was taking shape inside the gilded bunkers. Clots of media people,   and protesters crowded the lobby and nearby streets for the occasional clue, or at least glimpses of Marla Maples and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Kellyanne Conway posed for a selfie with a few lucky cops. The locus of the scene was a bank of elevators ferrying staff, cabinet candidates and the competing maestros of the Trump transition to and from various nerve centers over several floors. Every time a bell sounded, announcing the opening of an elevator door, lobby heads would bob expectantly. \u201cIs that what Jeff Sessions looks like?\u201d I heard a photographer ask (no, it is not, and it was not). No doubt a host of key Trump orchestrators and luminary actors were making ample use of auxiliary entrances and exits, sneaking in and out. New rumors, predictions and potential firestorms seemed to materialize every hour. The Kremlinology of the incoming White House is shaping up as knotty, to say the least. Not one of Trump\u2019s initial   hires has any experience working in a White House. How will they work with the volatile   and   maven in the Oval Office? With his proclivity to make decisions based on the last person he speaks to? With his children playing an uncertain role, his    a possibly   whisperer? How will it all work with Trump\u2019s senior adviser Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, who has a long rap sheet of racial, ethnic and sexist affronts and a   war on Washington Republicans? I had gone to Trump Tower to see Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, whom Trump named as his chief of staff five days after his election, in the same release in which Bannon was named chief strategist and senior counselor. Bannon was mentioned first, for Kremlinologists scoring at home, and his appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention, given his hyperprovocative ways. But Priebus, in a sense, filled a more exotic role. He would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up. A generous reading is that Trump is trying to foster a   tension between his top deputies, who will represent his own diametrically opposed impulses (Bannon the   devil on one shoulder, Priebus the peacemaking angel on the other). The simpler reading is that Trump hasn\u2019t thought that much about this and is simply trying to reward and surround himself with people he feels served him well in the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a puzzle mystery,\u201d Priebus told me last summer. I don\u2019t recall what we were talking about, but Priebus had a knack for homespun Wisconsin logic and, particularly, throwaway lines that would stick with me. I kept thinking of the puzzle mysteries that were playing out up and down Trump Tower, even though I showed up Friday without an appointment with Priebus and was confined to the lobby watching tourists ride up and down its   escalators. Priebus and I started talking last spring, as I was undertaking an article for this magazine about the seemingly fracturing state of the Republican Party. We kept in touch during the campaign, drank the occasional Miller High Life in his office and exchanged the sporadic email. Priebus was constantly going on TV saying he was certain Trump would win, even though he could read polls and precedents like everyone else. Still, he carried on as the chief carrier of Trump\u2019s choppy water because that\u2019s what a party chairman does: He smiles and spins and swallows his   plans and audibles in the name of getting his nominee to the finish line. In a sense, Priebus, who squired his future wife to a local G. O. P. banquet on their first date, was the purest form of \u201cpolitical hack\u201d that Trump would rail against as he bulldozed the G. O. P. For his efforts during the campaign, Priebus gained the respect and gratitude of Trump loyalists  \u2014   especially the fiercest loyalist, Donald J. Trump himself. He also won derision and ridicule. He was the subject of multiple stories in The Onion (\u201cReince Priebus Smiles, Shakes Head While Flipping Through Old Briefing on G. O. P. \u2019s Plans for 2016\u201d). His spirited TV defenses of Trump\u2019s indefensible behavior drew him comparisons to \u201cBaghdad Bob\u201d (Muhammad Said  ) Saddam Hussein\u2019s chief propagandist during the early months of the Iraq war, whose dubious predictions of imminent victory despite growing devastation all around made him an international laughingstock. Long before Trump\u2019s victory, back when it seemed like a long shot, I asked Priebus whether he would consider taking a job in a Trump administration  \u2014   maybe a plum ambassadorship to somewhere. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cWisconsin. \u201d It was a throwaway answer to a throwaway question, which was laughably hypothetical anyway. But I never had a sense he had thought that much about a Trump administration job, besides possibly staying on as R. N. C. chairman whether or not the Donald prevailed. For all his   sheepishness, Priebus\u2019s \u201cjust a kid from Kenosha, Wisc. \u201d shtick belies a penchant for main stages,   rooms and   company. No shortage of Reince Priebus photos hang on the walls of the R. N. C. \u2019s headquarters on Capitol Hill. He can be a little  . He travels far and often to appear with candidates and party dignitaries at events where his presence is not necessarily required. Priebus was giddy when I spoke to him last spring as he prepared to attend a party for Time\u2019s \u201c100 most influential people\u201d at Lincoln Center. We were on the phone, him walking through the lobby of the J. W. Marriott after a packed day of  . He sounded almost out of breath, less from exhaustion than what seemed like pure excitement. He told me how stoked he was to meet the golfer Jordan Spieth and the     the Rock. \u201cThose are my top two,\u201d Priebus said, especially the Rock. \u201cI was a big   fan back in the day,\u201d he added, noting his childhood admiration for Hulk Hogan and Mad Dog Vachon. \u201cGrowing up in Kenosha, Wisc. being named to the Top 100 list is a pretty cool thing,\u201d Priebus told me. At this point, I reminded him that no national party chairman would ever be named to the Top 100 except in extraordinary circumstances like these  \u2014   and these were not particularly enviable ones. The White House chief of staff\u2019s post is arguably the most grueling job in Washington. It would be a burnout caldron under even the most predictable and disciplined of presidents. The average tenure of a White House chief of staff is about two years.    jobs are so synonymous with thanklessness that a whole White House mythology surrounds them. \u201cA good chief of staff is seldom popular,\u201d Richard Nixon wrote in his 1990 memoir. \u201cHe must see that his chief gets the credit for the administration\u2019s successes and must take the heat for its failures, even when they are not his fault. . .. He sometimes finds he doesn\u2019t have many friends or supporters. Some may well call him just a prat boy. \u201d Some may call Priebus worse than that, and maybe already have. \u201cEat rocks\u201d is an expression I\u2019ve heard Priebus use a few times. It refers to being game to do what is needed: swallowing pride and taking one (or one thousand) for the team. If serving as R. N. C. chairman in 2016 has been the definition of eating rocks, Priebus\u2019s next gig could go down even harder. \u201cIt\u2019s   and never stops,\u201d says Andy Card of the job he held in George W. Bush\u2019s White House for more than five years, making him the    chief of staff in history. \u201cMy only area of angst on Priebus is that he has young children,\u201d Card added, referring to Priebus\u2019s son and daughter. Card has a few other concerns, one of which he says presented itself as soon as Trump \u201cjumped all over\u201d Megyn Kelly in the first Republican primary debate last year. \u201cI\u2019m thinking he would be a very hard president to work for if he doesn\u2019t accept people speaking candidly to him. \u201d Card, who remains close to the Bush family and supported Jeb Bush for president, said the most important part of being a chief of staff is remembering that the \u201cstaff\u201d part is far more important than the \u201cchief\u201d part. The president is by far his most important client. \u201cI know of one chief of staff who failed because he was used to being a principal,\u201d says Beth Myers, who served as Mitt Romney\u2019s chief of staff during his four years as governor of Massachusetts. Priebus may not have that problem he has been described with that most anodyne term for a Washington manager, the \u201c . \u201d But the White House chief of staff job is not so much about building consensus, Card told me. It\u2019s all about serving the only principal who matters. \u201cChief of staff is the only job in Washington that really is defined by what the president\u2019s idiosyncrasies are,\u201d Card says. \u201cAre they a morning person or an evening person? Disciplined or not? Do they suffer fools kindly or not?\u201d Priebus and the future   had their dicey stretches, but their relationship grew as the campaign wore on. \u201cTrump told me over and over again, \u2018I trust Reince, I trust him,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Priebus felt a need to tell me one day in his office last spring. They have both proved a lot of people wrong and were both aggressively underestimated along the way, if not outright dismissed. \u201cI don\u2019t buy this theory that unpredictable is necessarily bad,\u201d Priebus said back when Trump was just his ruffian nominee and not yet his future boss. You can\u2019t appreciate the magnitude of Priebus\u2019s changing loyalties until you consider just how much time, energy and dignity he expended before Nov. 8 trying to protect \u201cthe party\u201d from being defiled by Trump. \u201cDonald Trump is Donald Trump, and the party is the party,\u201d Priebus used to tell me during the campaign. His ultimate allegiance was never in question. It was only six years ago that Priebus was happily ensconced in Kenosha as chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Now he is being described as the consummate \u201cWashington insider\u201d in the Trump White House. He certainly has a line to Republican officials, namely his close friend and fellow Wisconsinite Paul Ryan. But in the end, for Priebus, it\u2019s now all about serving Trump, whose partisan impulses have proved flexible through the years  \u2014   let alone his allegiance to the G. O. P. He ran, foremost, as a candidate of disruption. He fashioned himself a dealmaker. No doubt this could immediately run afoul of the conservative orthodoxy that has driven the Republican agenda on Capitol Hill. Trump also vowed to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of the \u201cbloodsucker\u201d lobbyists and \u201cblood money\u201d   \u201cpolitical hacks\u201d and various other parasites and   that have fattened themselves so spectacularly in   City. In many ways, these are Priebus\u2019s people. He has cavorted,   and campaigned with them for years, attended their    donors\u2019 breakfasts and mediated their disputes for the good of the party. He will most likely be looked upon as a chief emissary to the Capitol Hill, K Street and donor constituencies that Trump explicitly campaigned against  \u2014   the chief of swamp. For his part, Bannon has undertaken an incendiary mission over the years to upend the G. O. P. \u201cestablishment,\u201d no one more so than Ryan (\u201ca total and complete sellout of the American people,\u201d Breitbart once declared, referring to Ryan\u2019s stewardship of House appropriations). Bannon could occupy something of a mysterious Svengali role in the tradition of presumed   presidential whisperers like Karl Rove (for George W. Bush) and Valerie Jarrett (for Barack Obama). Both Rove and Jarrett represented wild cards in their respective White Houses and regular thorns in the sides of the various chiefs of staffs with whom they served. But one notable difference is that neither Rove nor Jarrett made it his or her goal to obliterate the establishments that their presidents were trying to fold themselves into nor did either have close ties to fringe elements of their parties, as Bannon has to the     and its main platform. Breitbart has been described as a \u201cwhite   propaganda mill\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The site has posted articles linking undocumented immigrants to disease, declared in a headline that \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy,\u201d promoted the Confederate flag (\u201cHoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage\u201d) and referred to Gabby Giffords as \u201cthe   Movement\u2019s Human Shield. \u201d Bannon, who has tried to play down the most extreme elements of the   in recent days, nonetheless viewed Trump as a kindred provocateur  \u2014   a feeling that appears mutual. In one form or another, Priebus will try to integrate his establishment orientations with these disruptive forces operating all around him. Back during the campaign, Priebus used to refer admiringly to Trump as \u201can earthquake in a box. \u201d In a separate conversation (and metaphor) he described his challenge to me as keeping Trump inside \u201cthe funnel. \u201d Presumably this meant keeping him directed and contained, easier said than done, but still fascinating  \u2014   and somewhat entertaining  \u2014   to watch unfold in the campaign. But with the presence of Bannon and the weight of Trump leading a nervous and divided nation, the challenge in the White House is considerably less entertaining to contemplate. Washington  \u2014   like the presidency, certainly  \u2014   creates its own distinct funnel that will shape Trump and everyone around him in inexplicable and perhaps dark ways. As it turned out, Priebus never showed his face in the lobby of Trump\u2019s building, at least when I was there. Like many key players inside Trump\u2019s ragtag circle of collaborators, Priebus has gone largely dark since Election Day, holing up in Transition Tower with occasional hops down to Washington. He was not responding to my emails and was described by gatekeepers as \u201cdrinking from multiple fire hoses. \u201d So for now, my most recent and enduring image of Priebus is watching him beaming and   and a bit stunned on TV in the early hours of Nov. 9. A triumphant Trump had just called him to the podium, declared him a \u201csuperstar\u201d and compared him to Secretariat. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you, Reince is really a star,\u201d Trump exulted. \u201cReince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince. \u201d Trump offered him the mike and insisted he say something. There could be no more of a pinnacle moment for an avowed Republican Party animal who used to listen to Newt Gingrich speeches in the car as a teenager. He would soon go from being one of the most   figures in American politics to one of the most    insiders in a White House of insurgents. \u201cLadies and gentleman, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump,\u201d was all Priebus could muster. There were worse images to dwell on before the drama intensified and puzzle mysteries inevitably presented themselves. Who knew what the night\u2019s result would lead to or what \u201cnormal\u201d would become for any of the Trumpians soon, or any of us?'"}, "time": 1742562832.3676789}
