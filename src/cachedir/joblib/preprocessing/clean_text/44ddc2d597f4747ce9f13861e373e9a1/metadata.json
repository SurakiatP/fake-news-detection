[\u201cDoes he sometimes cross the line where his tweets become the news, become the agenda, and actually impedes the ability to get things done?\u201d asked Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts during Tuesday\u2019s White House press briefing, pointing out that \u201cusing it and using it wisely are two different things. \u201d  Spicer said that Trump\u2019s use of social media was a \u201cvery, very effective tool\u201d for communication for his millions of followers across social media platforms. \u201cI think the same people who are critiquing his use of it now, critiqued it during the election, and it turned out pretty well for him then,\u201d Spicer quipped. According to a White House tech source, the president has about   million social media followers. When asked if the Trump\u2019s tweets should be considered official statements from the White House, Spicer appeared incredulous. \u201cWell the president is the president of the United States, so they\u2019re considered official statements of the President of the United States,\u201d he replied.
