[Democrats like Representative Luis Gutierrez (  ) mocked Trump\u2019s assessment, but a video published by the Independent Police Review Authority shows that the moniker \u201cwar zone\u201d is \u00e0propos.  The video is a compilation of dash and body cam videos that were made while officers pursued and ultimately \u201cshot and killed    Richard Grimes, who was suspected of shooting a pregnant    woman in the abdomen in the 4600 block of West Adams. \u201d The caption from the video sets the scene: The incident started about 11:30 p. m. on Nov. 27, [2016] as officers responded to a call of the domestic battery. After the initial shooting, Grimes left the scene but ran into officers in the first block of North Kenton, where he fired a handgun at the officers before running away, police said at the time. The officers chased Grimes and a perimeter of the area was established. Dashboard camera video appears to show Grimes shooting at one officer as he exited his police car. The officer immediately dropped to the ground as others arrived and looked to be checking to see if he was shot. Grimes was spotted again in a gangway in the 4500 block of West Washington, where he again shot at the officers, authorities said. The officers returned fire, striking him. Dozens of gunshots can be heard in the videos, with police dispatchers warning officers to \u201cWatch the crossfire. \u201d A short time later, an officer yells \u201cHe\u2019s down! He\u2019s down! He\u2019s down!\u201d WARNING \u2014    SITUATIONS,  President Trump\u2019s ABC News interview aired on January 25, and the Wall Street Journal quoted Trump comparing Chicago to a \u201cwar zone. \u201d In fact, the president suggested Chicago is worse that some of the areas where our troops are currently deployed, saying, \u201cAfghanistan is not like what\u2019s happening in Chicago. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
