[\u201cThe president is unbelievably disappointed in the previous administration\u2019s deal that was made and how poorly it was crafted,\u201d Spicer explained to reporters at the White House Press Briefing.  Speaking to   executives and union members, Trump mentioned the discussion about the deal with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \u201cI just said why?   \u2026     Why are we doing this. What\u2019s the purpose?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. \u201d Spicer confirmed that the refugees would be allowed into the United States, but would go through a \u201cvery very extreme vetting process\u201d to make sure they had peaceful intentions. Trump signaled his opposition to the deal, after reports surfaced that he had an angry phone call with Turnbull. \u201cDo you believe it?
