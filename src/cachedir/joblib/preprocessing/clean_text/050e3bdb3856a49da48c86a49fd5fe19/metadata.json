This just goes to show how out of control things were during the Clinton administration, and it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Who\u2019s to say what else went on that night? Did Bill end up fingering some young one from Muirhevnamor? We can only assume he did\u201d. \\nCurrently on the 2016 presidential campaign trail, Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the allegation, although a look of \u2018oh fuck\u2019 crept across her face when it was mentioned.'"}, "time": 1742562739.9751341}
