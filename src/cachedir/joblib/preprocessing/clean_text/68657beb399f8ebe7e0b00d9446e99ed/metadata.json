A. on Tuesday \u201creluctantly\u201d lifted its ban on holding championship events in North Carolina, removing its    prohibition less than a week after the state\u2019s Legislature and governor repealed a   bathroom bill that had led to boycotts of the state. The organization, which governs college athletics, said in a statement that the law\u2019s replacement in North Carolina had \u201cminimally achieved a situation where we believe N. C. A. A. championships may be conducted in a nondiscriminatory environment. \u201d The earlier law, known as House Bill 2, or H. B. 2, had removed   protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and it required transgender people to use bathrooms in public facilities that aligned with their sex at birth. While the replacement bill bars local governments from passing their own ordinances on the topic until 2020, it left regulation of bathrooms up to the State Legislature. The N. C. A. A.\u2019s carefully worded statement left the door open to its continuing to make decisions on a    basis and even to retracting hosting opportunities on short notice in light of new developments  \u2014   as it did last year, when it moved several championship events, including men\u2019s basketball tournament games, out of the state. The N. C. A. A. noted that it requires prospective hosts to submit \u201cadditional documentation\u201d  \u2014   it includes a questionnaire  \u2014   about their ability to protect visitors from discrimination. At the same time, by providing a clearer blueprint of what is not and, now, is acceptable, the N. C. A. A. gave comfort not only to North Carolina lawmakers but to those in other states considering restrictions similar to those in North Carolina\u2019s new law. In Texas, where next year\u2019s Final Four is set to be held (in San Antonio) the author of such a proposal, known as Senate Bill 6, or the Texas Privacy Act, cheered the N. C. A. A.\u2019s decision on Tuesday. \u201cI applaud the N. C. A. A. for now agreeing that there is nothing discriminatory about the Texas Privacy Act,\u201d its author, Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican state senator, said in a statement, \u201cor our honest efforts to address the serious issue of privacy and safety in our public facilities and school showers, locker rooms and restrooms. \u201d While advocates on both sides of the debate have tended to describe North Carolina\u2019s compromise as insufficient, the state\u2019s business community, which opposed H. B. 2 on pragmatic grounds, saw the N. C. A. A.\u2019s decision as a   vindication. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to see that the N. C. A. A. has renewed its faith in North Carolina and the Charlotte region once again,\u201d Tom Murray, chief executive of the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority, said. \u201cThe events that the N. C. A. A. touches are far more important to our region than just the significant economic impact they inject into our community. We\u2019re energized that we\u2019ll be able to both partner with the N. C. A. A. and compete to host these events in the coming years. \u201d J. Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College in Salisbury, N. C. said that as a practical matter, \u201cthe reluctant hesitancy but acknowledgment of North Carolina having these opportunities from the N. C. A. A. will hopefully start to smooth the waters in this state\u201d and will, to outside businesses, act as a \u201csignal to start putting North Carolina back on their plate of opportunities. \u201d Bitzer added that this was so even though the policy landscape in North Carolina remained ambiguous: The new law, he said, \u201ccertainly took H. B. 2 off the books, but it didn\u2019t necessarily take off the policies, considering that the state still controls nondiscrimination policy. \u201d (Republicans enjoy   supermajorities in the Legislature, he noted.) The two sides that struck the deal last week were motivated in no small part by a desire to placate the N. C. A. A. in a state where college sports are culturally vital (and where the flagship university\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team won its sixth national championship on Monday night). North Carolina Coach Roy Williams and Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski had publicly criticized H. B. 2. Both sides welcomed the N. C. A. A.\u2019s decision on Tuesday. \u201cWe are pleased with the N. C. A. A.\u2019s decision and acknowledgment that our compromise legislation \u2018restores the state to   \u2026     a landscape similar to other jurisdictions presently hosting N. C. A. A. championships,\u2019 \u201d the State Senate leader, Phil Berger, and the House Speaker, Tim Moore, both Republicans, said in a statement. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said in his own statement that while \u201cmore work remains to be done,\u201d the N. C. A. A.\u2019s decision was \u201cgood news. \u201d Critics of the state\u2019s new law condemned the N. C. A. A. \u201cThe N. C. A. A.\u2019s decision to backtrack on their vow to protect L. G. B. T. Q. players, employees and fans is deeply disappointing and puts people at risk,\u201d Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, said. \u201cAfter drawing a line in the sand and calling for repeal of H. B. 2, the N. C. A. A. simply let North Carolina lawmakers off the hook. \u201d Athlete Ally also released a statement criticizing the N. C. A. A. Hudson Taylor, the organization\u2019s founder and executive director, had said that the N. C. A. A.\u2019s rescinding of its ban would set \u201ca challenging precedent. \u201d \u201cIf the N. C. A. A. is willing to go back to North Carolina when there is still an overt lack of L. G. B. T. protections and respect under the law,\u201d he said in an interview on Monday, \u201cthen other states looking to pass  . G. B. T. legislation know they will still be rewarded with N. C. A. A. events and can go forward with that legislation. \u201d Advocates on the right also continued to train a cautious eye on the N. C. A. A. \u201cH. B. 2 was never as controversial as the media and liberal activists wanted us to believe,\u201d said Francis De Luca, president of Civitas, which calls itself North Carolina\u2019s Conservative Voice. He added, \u201cWe will be watching to see if the N. C. A. A.\u2019s action matches their rhetoric. \u201d The N. C. A. A. is expected to begin announcing championship events through 2022 this month. Last week, the Atlantic Coast Conference, which is headquartered in the state and had joined the N. C. A. A. in moving its   championships out of the state after the passage of H. B. 2 last year, announced that it was again open to staging such events, like its football title game, in the state. The N. B. A. which moved its   Game in February from Charlotte in response to the old law, is expected to address the issue at its owners\u2019 meeting this week. The N. C. A. A.\u2019s boycott of North Carolina for championship events had intense reverberations in the state. The Duke and North Carolina men\u2019s basketball teams had to begin play in the N. C. A. A. tournament in Greenville, S. C. rather than in Greensboro, N. C. closer to campus. An Associated Press study found that House Bill 2 could have cost the state nearly $4 billion over 12 years because of canceled events.'"}, "time": 1742561809.4327116}
