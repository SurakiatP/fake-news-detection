Steve Beshear referred to himself as a \u201cproud Republican. \u201d[Addressing the camera from a diner in Kentucky, former Gov. Beshear appeared to tangle his words, stating that \u201cI\u2019m a proud Democrat, but first and foremost, I\u2019m a proud Republican, and Democrat, and mostly, American. \u201d  Beshear went on to attack Trump on a number of issues, claiming that Trump planned to \u201crip affordable health insurance from Americans who must need it,\u201d as Trump and Republicans formulate plans to fully repeal Obamacare. The former governor also accused Trump of being \u201cWall Street\u2019s champion,\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s executive orders \u201cmakes it harder for families to even afford a mortgage,\u201d while \u201crolling back rules that provide oversight of the financial industry and protect us against another economic meltdown. \u201d He also criticized Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, describing them as a \u201ccabinet of billionaires and Wall Street insiders who want to eviscerate the protections that most Americans count on and help level the playing field. \u201d The tone of the response appeared to be a pitch to the working class Americans who helped propel Trump to victory last November, with the video set in a modest diner surrounded by people Beshear claimed were his neighbors, as well as a mix of both Democrats and Republicans. Donald Trump\u2019s speech covered a number of issues, such as healthcare, defense spending, cutting the size of government, and the need for unity in a divided America. A CNN poll later found that nearly four out of five Americans had a \u201cpositive reaction\u201d to the speech.
