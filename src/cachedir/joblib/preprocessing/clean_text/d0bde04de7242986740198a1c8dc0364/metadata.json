Trump pressing their cases in neighboring demonstrations as Republicans strained to project party unity. But amid the twin national reckonings over police violence and violence against the police, officers here seemed determined to avoid provoking those who gathered. Though the police presence was felt at every turn, where uniformed officers often waited on rows of bicycles, they intervened in the protests sparingly, to enforce security perimeters or, in a handful of instances, to separate protesters and counterprotesters. \u201cIt\u2019s a little scary,\u201d Kim Moran, the wife of an Illinois delegate, said as she recorded a video of an   rally. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of hate going on. \u201d Yet for most of the day, rival demonstrators appeared to have achieved a relative peace, however fleeting it might prove. The proceedings began around noon, when about 200 Trump supporters gathered in a park for an \u201cAmerica First\u201d rally, hauling lawn chairs and, occasionally, carrying firearms for an event intended to exhibit the breadth of Mr. Trump\u2019s followers. Subgroups drawn to the rally included Bikers for Trump, Truckers for Trump and Students for Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s never said anything racist,\u201d said Eric Smith, 36, who is black and was wearing a Trump  . \u201cHe means just to say, \u2018Make America great again as itself.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018Build yourself up and then you can build up the people around you. \u2019\u201d Soon, Roger J. Stone Jr. a longtime Trump confidant, regaled the crowd with attacks on Hillary Clinton. Meeting at a public square less than a mile away, hundreds of   protesters marched through downtown Cleveland, hoping to move as close as possible to the Quicken Loans Arena, the site of the convention. When they arrived at the low concrete barriers outside the arena, they chanted: \u201cShut it down!\u201d After a few hesitant moments, people began climbing over the barriers. The police did not interfere. As marchers approached the main security checkpoint for the convention grounds, where delegates pass through Secret Service screenings, a phalanx of officers on bicycles rode tire to tire, preventing the protesters from reaching the inner security perimeter. \u201cThere are all kinds of different groups here for different reasons, but we\u2019re united to shut this down,\u201d said Holly Counterpane, a protester from Chicago. \u201cNobody\u2019s trying to hurt, get hurt or get arrested. \u201d The officers, like urban cattle wranglers, steered the marchers along a row of downtown restaurants. Bryan Hambley, a Cleveland doctor who is organizing a protest march against Mr. Trump planned later this week, said the news media had exaggerated the potential for violence and chaos. \u201cThe Trump supporters are having their rallies across town,\u201d he said as the first   gathering began. \u201cThey didn\u2019t send any counterprotesters here. \u201d He added, \u201cWe didn\u2019t send counterprotesters to antagonize them. \u201d At times, officers positioned themselves between small groups of   protesters and counterprotesters as the dueling groups exchanged insults. Before the convention began, the shooting deaths of three police officers on Sunday in Baton Rouge, La. promised to cast a pall over the first day. Mr. Trump has taken pains to present himself as the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate  \u2014   the theme of Monday\u2019s convention program is \u201cMake America Safe Again\u201d  \u2014   and the campaign has made clear its plans to capitalize on the national sense of unrest. The smattering of demonstrations on Sunday had been mostly tame. But with the convention officially beginning, the slate of protests on Monday produced a measure of tumult. Around 3 p. m. the band Prophets of Rage, which includes veterans of Rage Against the Machine, highlighted a second   march, which later joined with an antipoverty march. \u201cThank you for coming out today with your joy and your militancy,\u201d Tom Morello, a guitarist with the group, told the crowd. His hat bore a message: \u201cMake America Rage Again. \u201d While organizers had expected thousands of people at the antipoverty march, the total was closer to a few hundred, shouting slogans like \u201cCleveland means we got to fight back\u201d and \u201cthey think it\u2019s a game, they think it\u2019s a joke. \u201d Some demonstrators expressed mixed feelings about the conspicuous police presence. Rodrigo Starz, part of the   duo Rebel Diaz, surmised that there were \u201cmore police than people,\u201d calling the officers\u2019 approach menacing and unnecessary. But, he said, he was grateful that the march had been peaceful. The attack in Baton Rouge on Sunday had prompted urgent calls from one local police union to restrict   gun laws near the convention site. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, said he could not legally intervene, given the state\u2019s gun laws. Calvin D. Williams, Cleveland\u2019s chief of police, told reporters on Monday that the shooting in Baton Rouge had not altered the city\u2019s security plans. After five officers in Dallas were killed this month, the police here began dispatching patrol cars with at least two officers at a time. \u201cOur officers are told to be especially cautious,\u201d Chief Williams said. At another briefing in the early evening, Chief Williams said one person had been arrested on Monday, a woman with a felony warrant. He did not say what the warrant was for. He said officers had confiscated several items, including a small knife, gas masks and a slingshot. Still, some attendees seemed a bit skittish about their security, wondering aloud about the state\u2019s   designation. One Trump supporter, John Nadler, 63, said he feared his Trump apparel made him a target. \u201cEven Governor Kasich said he\u2019s not going to stop open carry,\u201d said Mr. Nadler, one of the few Trump admirers from Chappaqua, N. Y. where Mrs. Clinton lives. \u201cThey got cops, I\u2019m afraid they are going to get me. I got a Trump hat and a Trump  . Why not pick me off?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561754.86915}
