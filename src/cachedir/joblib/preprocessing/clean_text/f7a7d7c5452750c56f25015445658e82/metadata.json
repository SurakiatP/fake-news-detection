Hillary just got killed! She is not going to survive this! It\u2019s too much! Pure treason! \\nAccording to Conservative Daily Post: Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. \\nAfter all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. \\nBecause of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. \\nAn email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: \u201cWestern intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region\u201d to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of \u201cproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.\u201d \\nCiting the need to \u201cuse our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,\u201d said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were \u201cimportant to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.\u201d \\nOdd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary\u2019s largest donations come from those two countries. \\nIn another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 \u201cbirthday check.\u201d \\nThe email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would \u201cwelcome the Clinton Foundation\u2019s suggestions for investments in Haiti \u2014 particularly on education and health.\u201d Desai added that while Qatar had already \u201callocated most of their $20 million \u2026 they were happy to consider projects we suggest.\u201d Like this?
