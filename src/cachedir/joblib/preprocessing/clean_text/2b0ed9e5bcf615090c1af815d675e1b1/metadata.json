I\u2019ve been reliably informed that everyone who\u2019s anyone in conservative America reads MILO, and he has been gracious enough to lend me his column today to send you a simple message  \u2014   Sears and our other failing brand   fucking hate you! [We\u2019re not the first company to think of this innovative customer relations strategy. Nordstrom took the bold first leap into openly shitting on their own shoppers by dumping Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line  \u2014   but be realistic conservatives, that particularly racist cissexist misogynistic antisemitic transphobic fatphobic treephobic icecreamphobic autoerotasphyxiaphobic   member of the first family had it coming. Never mind that she is a woman married to a Jewish man, just trust my  !  It makes sense for Sears and   to dump the Trump Home Collection. In fact, I\u2019m struggling to figure out why we didn\u2019t do it sooner. I guess we can\u2019t be accused of being the rocket scientists of the retail world. Just think of the advantages this presents. We\u2019re closing 150 stores by April. If we didn\u2019t piss off half of America with a move against the democratically elected commander in chief and his family, imagine how crowded our remaining stores could be! And we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see much blowback on our brands. Conservatives are certainly more likely to buy products from our most famous line of products, Craftsman tools, because you like to do things like fix machines and follow disgusting patriarchal gender roles like being handy. Most liberals either live in a big city with no lawn, or have illegal Mexicans working for below minimum wage mow their lawn, so Craftsman tractors are in the same boat. Well, that doesn\u2019t matter because we\u2019ve sold off our best known products anyway! Yes, I will allow we are slightly concerned about some of our other brands. Our Diehard line of vehicle products might turn off metrosexuals, but at least the lesbians still enjoy some automotive maintenance. And the vegans who remind you on Facebook every five minutes that they are vegan will line up to buy Kenmore grills and barbeque equipment, right? We are still working out the details, as you can see, but we know Sears and   can still excel in certain areas. Our high quality sheets can represent a valid fashion alternative for America\u2019s most obese shoppers, a market we will not surrender to competitor JC Penney. Beyond the numbers, dumping Trump is going to make us feel damn good. We will be able to bask in the glow of Hollywood liberals, who we stand beside in making empty gestures against the President of the United States. Heck, maybe J. K. Rowling will like this move so much, she\u2019ll write me in as the next Headmaster at Hogwarts! Let\u2019s be honest  \u2014   we at Sears Holdings have to put feelings before facts. Our stock has cratered in the past six months from almost $18 to $7, and I can\u2019t bear to look at a chart that goes back further. If you did something crazy like read this report from FOX Business, you\u2019d see we are doing terrible by every conceivable retail metric. Falling revenue, terrible comparable store sales and questionable survivability. We\u2019ve pumped $12 billion into Sears Holdings to keep the lights on, and I have to keep loaning my own company money to make suppliers feel comfortable sending us products to put on the shelves. Some companies facing hard times will carefully examine the market and build a business plan that doesn\u2019t actively antagonize half of the country. Sears isn\u2019t one of those companies. Other companies might also review what happened when other companies in their industry took similar steps. We aren\u2019t one of those companies either  \u2014   we really don\u2019t care that Target has had a tough road following their own special   to conservatives. In summary, the Sears and   family knows it is making the right decision in telling you to get stuffed, and we think our business track record speaks for our judgement on making smart decisions.
