C.  \u2014   In the feverishly manicured spectacle that is electoral politics, there are few distractions quite as imposing to candidates as a small child. Just this week, Donald J. Trump earned a wave of negative headlines after he confronted a crying baby at a rally in Virginia. Mike Pence learned that lesson the hard  \u2014   and perhaps revealing  \u2014   way at a rally here on Thursday morning when he solicited a question from an    boy, Matthew Schricker. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching the news lately, and I\u2019ve been noticing that you\u2019ve been kind of softening up on Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and words,\u201d Matthew said skeptically. \u201cIs this going to be your role in the administration?\u201d Mr. Pence stood   for a moment before offering an uneasy chuckle. \u201cWhat did you say I\u2019ve been doing?\u201d Mr. Pence asked over laughter from the crowd. \u201cYou\u2019ve been kind of softening up on his words,\u201d Matthew steadfastly replied. Many political analysts far Matthew\u2019s senior have been pondering the same thought. In the past week and a half, Mr. Pence has taken divergent stances from (or cleaned up after) his running mate on a series of issues, including the possibility of Russia\u2019s hacking Hillary Clinton\u2019s email, the treatment of the Khan family and the candidacy of Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Pence tried to regain his footing by complimenting his interlocutor. \u201cNo. 1, this boy has a future,\u201d Mr. Pence pronounced. \u201cNicely done. \u201d After predicting that Matthew would one day be governor of North Carolina, Mr. Pence tried to fill the gaps between some of his positions and those of his more bombastic running mate by attributing their differences to manner rather than matter. \u201cSometimes things don\u2019t always come out like you mean, right?\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cAnd Donald Trump and I are absolutely determined to work together and we have different styles, you might have noticed that. \u201d Then Mr. Pence added, in a typical stroke of   that has become a necessary weapon in his campaign arsenal, \u201cYou know, I said at our convention, I said we\u2019d nominated someone who is larger than life, known for charisma, so they wanted to kind of balance the ticket. \u201d Mr. Pence said he wanted to make one thing clear to his young skeptic. \u201cDifferences in style, Matthew, should never be confused with differences in conviction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will tell you right now Donald Trump has the right vision for America, he has the right policies for America and I\u2019m going to fight every day to tell his story all across the United States. \u201d Matthew seemed persuaded. \u201cI was a little worried about him, and I just wanted to make sure he was totally loyal to Mr. Trump and the Republican Party,\u201d Matthew said after the event had ended. \u201cAnd now I think he is. \u201d At future gatherings, Mr. Pence may wish to pick on someone his own size.'"}, "time": 1742563942.5140564}
