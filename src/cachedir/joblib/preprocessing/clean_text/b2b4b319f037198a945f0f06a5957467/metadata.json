No, it was the unscripted instant in which a blas\u00e9 Mrs. Clinton coolly brushed from her shoulder a speck of lint, dirt  \u2014   or perhaps nothing at all  \u2014   as a   House panel subjected her to more than eight hours of questioning in October over her handling of the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. She may not be the orator President Obama is, or the retail politician her husband was. But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s steely fortitude in this campaign has plainly inspired older women, black voters and many others who see in her perseverance a kind of mirror to their own struggles. And Mrs. Clinton\u2019s very durability  \u2014   her tenacity, grit and capacity for enduring and overcoming adversity  \u2014   could be exactly what is required to defeat Donald J. Trump. As a politician\u2019s wife, first lady, senator and secretary of state  \u2014   and as a   candidate for president  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton, 68, has redefined the role of women in American politics each time she has reinvented herself. She has transfixed the nation again and again, as often in searing episodes of scandal or setback as in triumph. \u201cShe came on the public stage as someone who was a little different,\u201d said Ann Lewis, a longtime adviser. \u201cShe attracted fascination, devotion and attacks  \u2014   and the partisan attacks haven\u2019t stopped. \u201d \u201cEven as first lady, it was \u2018Who does she think she is? \u2019\u201d said Melanne Verveer, a close friend of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s who was her White House chief of staff. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s confidants say it is only fitting that, having overcome so many obstacles before, including some of her own making, she now faces an opponent so eager to go negative with her  \u2014   and to refight the   brawls that have defined her career. In her victory speech Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton said the biggest influence on her life had been her mother, \u201cand she taught me never to back down from a bully  \u2014   which turned out to be pretty good advice. \u201d It was with that same grit that Mrs. Clinton picked herself up after a bruising defeat by Mr. Obama in 2008, when she assured a crowd of tearful female supporters, eight years ago to the day, that they had made 18 million cracks in \u201cthe highest, hardest glass ceiling. \u201d For 14 straight years, and 20 in all, Mrs. Clinton has been named the woman Americans admire most, according to a yearly Gallup poll. But her campaign, and the controversy over her use of a private email server as secretary of state, have taken a toll: Her favorability and trustworthiness ratings have plummeted. And she is being caricatured, once more, as a calculating and inauthentic career politician: Lady Macbeth, now in her own play. In the same way, her longevity and fame are not undiluted assets: The baggage she brings as a consummate Democratic insider, pointed up most damagingly in the enormous sums she commanded as a paid speaker to Wall Street banks, has weighed Mrs. Clinton down in an election cycle in which outsiders have had the wind at their backs. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s career has not taken a predictable route by any stretch. She came of age in the feminist movement in the 1960s at Wellesley College  \u2014   where she urged her peers to spurn incremental change and instead work at \u201cmaking the impossible possible\u201d  \u2014   then was drawn to the South in furtherance of her husband\u2019s ambitions. She was one of her husband\u2019s chief campaign strategists and overseer of a failed health care effort, while holding her marriage together through his sex scandals and impeachment. But if she seemed to embody contradictions, they also reflected a society in which expectations of women, and women\u2019s expectations for themselves, were rapidly changing. And it has always been hard to parse opinions about Mrs. Clinton and about powerful women in general. Roy M. Neel, who was a campaign manager for Al Gore in his 1992   run, said in an oral history of the Bill Clinton years that women in the South particularly disliked Mrs. Clinton, the first working mother to serve as first lady and the first  \u2014   and, so far, the only  \u2014   to have an office in the West Wing, because she \u201cappeared to be something of an affront to their sense of who they were. \u201d If   antipathies to Mrs. Clinton can be chalked up in part to Americans\u2019 struggles to adjust to changing gender roles at home, at work and in politics, her history of political combat has also left scar tissue that, in part, defines the candidate she is:   about the realities of Washington, but cautious and wary to a fault. Her prolonged contest with Mr. Sanders, whose campaign was not widely expected to survive the first few nominating contests, laid bare the cost of that restraint, both in style and substance. As voters have gravitated to Mr. Trump\u2019s unchecked impulsiveness and Mr. Sanders\u2019s unabashed idealism, Mrs. Clinton has displayed little of either. \u201cThis is not an incremental, cautious election, and being cautious is not her friend,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. \u201cBoth primaries exposed the depth of anger and frustration and disgust,\u201d she added. \u201cShe has had to, and will have to, adjust to it. \u201d For 14 months, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has been out of step with younger voters and with swaths of an angry electorate that has demanded more than the competence and hard work she has promised. Her difficulties with those voters could be a warning sign. While her husband could draw on the crisp centrist philosophy of the \u201cthird way\u201d Democrats in 1992, when he devoted his candidacy to the \u201cforgotten middle class,\u201d Mrs. Clinton has struggled to hit upon as simple and clear a rationale for her campaign. And, though she has issued the most detailed policy proposals and positions of anyone in the race, what she truly believes remains a mystery for many voters. Mrs. Clinton has praised Mr. Obama\u2019s accomplishments over the past eight years, and won roughly 77 percent of the vote among blacks through the May 10 contests, according to exit polls. But she has also promised to push harder than Mr. Obama in extending citizenship to undocumented immigrants, opposed his signature   trade deal, and outstripped his plans to defeat the Islamic State by calling for a   zone in Syria. She has praised her husband\u2019s economic record as president and offered to put him in charge of reviving some of the   regions. But Mrs. Clinton has also had to repudiate crucial parts of her husband\u2019s legacy. It has not helped that her campaign has cycled through a   slogans, from championing \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d to \u201cfighting for us,\u201d \u201cbreaking down barriers,\u201d and, most recently, \u201cstronger together\u201d  \u2014   playing on Mr. Trump\u2019s more divisive remarks about Mexicans, Muslims and other groups. As Mr. Sanders has demonized Wall Street and Mr. Trump has disparaged immigrants, and as they have vowed to reverse economic malaise, Mrs. Clinton has run on a flinty practicality. The most telling promise she has made is that she will not overpromise. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more of that,\u201d she has told voters. But what she has lacked in rhetorical brio, she has made up for by listening to people\u2019s problems and prescribing solutions. She has shed tears in conversations with a man whose mother had Alzheimer\u2019s and a woman who lost a child to a gun accident. And she has shown a vulnerability she did not reveal in 2008, when she campaigned as a strong   commander in chief, seeking to neutralize any doubts about whether she was tough enough for the Oval Office. \u201cI am not a natural politician, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, like my husband or President Obama,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in one of her debates with Mr. Sanders, a bracingly honest statement. To her supporters, there may be a kind of strange logic at work. Mrs. Clinton is somehow expected to project the mettle of a commander in chief, the charisma of a drinking buddy, the warmth of a favorite aunt, they say. \u201cYou\u2019re required to be   and smiley and also required to grow a hide like an elephant,\u201d said Tina Brown, the journalist. \u201cWhich is it?\u201d An impossible combination, they complain  \u2014   and if she managed all that, there would no doubt emerge some other vital quality that she was failing to display, because there is no template yet for a female United States president. \u201cPeople are so undecided about how they feel about female leadership, and it\u2019s something people really struggle with,\u201d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York. \u201cThe ambiguity about Hillary is outside of her. It comes from people\u2019s own perspectives. \u201d Attitudes about female leadership eventually may change, of course. And in talking to reporters on Monday, hours before reports that she had clinched the nomination, Mrs. Clinton looked past November to a time when female presidential candidates may not require quite so much durability to have a shot at the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s predominantly women and girls, but not exclusively  \u2014   men bring their daughters to meet me and tell me that they are supporting me because of their daughters,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I do think it will make a very big difference for a father or a mother to be able to look at their daughter just like they can look at their son and say, \u2018You can be anything you want to be in this country, including president of the United States. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562732.7516701}
