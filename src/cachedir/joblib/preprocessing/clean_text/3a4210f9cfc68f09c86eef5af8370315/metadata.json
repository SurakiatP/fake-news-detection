He was 93. The cause was Alzheimer\u2019s disease, his wife, Catherine Chaine, said. Mr. Riboud\u2019s career of more than 60 years carried him routinely to turbulent places throughout Asia and Africa in the 1950s and \u201960s, but he may be best remembered for two photographs taken in the developed world. The first, from 1953, is of a workman poised like an angel in overalls between a lattice of girders while painting the Eiffel Tower  \u2014   one hand raising a paintbrush, one leg bent in a seemingly Chaplinesque attitude. The second, from 1967, is of a young woman presenting a flower to a phalanx of   members of the National Guard during an   War demonstration at the Pentagon. Both images were published in Life magazine during what is often called the golden age of photojournalism, an era Mr. Riboud (pronounced  ) exemplified. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Henri   he was on the front lines of world events, including wars. Even so, Mr. Riboud did not consider himself a record keeper. \u201cI have shot very rarely news,\u201d he once said. Rather than portray the military parades or political leaders of the Soviet Union, for example, he was drawn to anonymous citizens sitting in the snow, holding miniature chess boards and absorbed in their books. Of the many hundreds of shots he published from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Pakistan, Tibet and Turkey, only a handful are of figures written about by historians. Born on June 24, 1923, in St.   near Lyon, he was the fifth and, by his account, the most shy of seven children from a bourgeois family that expected him to take up a respectable vocation. It was his father, an enthusiastic traveler and amateur photographer, who led him astray by giving him a   Kodak when Marc was a teenager. His first photographs were of the Paris Exposition in 1937. After World War II, in which he fought around Vercors as a member of the Resistance, Mr. Riboud studied mechanical engineering at the \u00c9cole Centrale in Lyon. He took a factory job in the nearby town of Villeurbanne after graduating in 1948. Not until he found himself taking pictures of a cultural festival in Lyon during a weeklong vacation in 1951 did he at last decide to commit to the unstable life of a freelance photojournalist. He moved to Paris in 1952. There he met   who became his mentor. Already a celebrity in his field, this \u201csalutary tyrant,\u201d as Mr. Riboud called him, dictated \u201cwhich books to read, what political ideas I should have, which museums and galleries to visit. \u201d \u201cHe taught me about life and about the art of photography,\u201d Mr. Riboud said. Among the lessons imparted was that \u201cgood photography\u201d is dependent on \u201cgood geometry. \u201d The Eiffel Tower photograph from 1953, the first that Mr. Riboud published, proves how well the pupil absorbed the lesson. In a radio interview more than 50 years later, he still recalled the   caption given to the image by the Life copy writers: \u201c  on the Eiffel. \u201d In 1953,   nominated his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to join Magnum, the photo collective he had helped found. Until 1979, when he left to go out on his own, Mr. Riboud traveled and photographed for the agency constantly. In 1955, he drove a specially equipped Land Rover to Calcutta from Paris, staying for a year in India. He was also one of the first Westerners to photograph in Communist China, and he spent three months in the Soviet Union in 1960. Throughout the 1950s and \u201960s he documented the anticolonial independence movements in Algeria and West Africa, and during the Vietnam War he was among the few able to move easily between the North and South. In the United States, he documented not only protests against the Vietnam War but also a pensive Maureen Dean listening to her husband, the Nixon aide John W. Dean, testify at the Watergate hearings in 1973. Among the events he documented in recent decades were the return of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to Iran the Solidarity movement in Poland the trial of Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo chief in Lyon during World War II the end of apartheid in South Africa and the mood in the United States before the election of President Obama. During the last third of his life, Mr. Riboud was recognized by museums in many of the countries where he had worked. Photographs from his travels were collected in more than a dozen monographs, including \u201cMarc Riboud: Photographs at Home and Abroad\u201d (1986) \u201cMarc Riboud: Journal\u201d (1988) and \u201cMarc Riboud in China: Forty Years of Photography\u201d (1996). Among many other shows, Mr. Riboud was honored with exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago, in 1964, and the International Center of Photography in New York, in 1975, 1988 and 1997. He was the subject of retrospectives at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1985 and the Maison Europ\u00e9enne de la Photographie in Paris in 2004. Unlike some artists who resent that the public\u2019s infatuation with a few of their works has turned them into clich\u00e9s, Mr. Riboud did not mind describing the circumstances behind \u201cThe Eiffel Tower Painter. \u201d No, he did not ask the workman to pose, he would answer patiently. To have spoken to the man might have caused him to slip. \u201cI\u2019ve always been shy, and I\u2019ve always been trying to ignore the people I was photographing so that they ignore me,\u201d he said. Of the flower girl at the Pentagon, a    high school student named Jan Rose Kasmir, he ventured, \u201cI had the feeling the soldiers were more afraid of her than she was of the bayonets. \u201d (The two later reunited in London, where he photographed her carrying a poster of the 1967 image at a demonstration against the Iraq War in 2003.) The immense popularity of these two photographs, assisted by countless reproductions, could well have warped perceptions of Mr. Riboud\u2019s highly diverse body of work. And yet they did truly represent the gravitational bent of his personality. \u201cI have always been more sensitive to the beauty of the world than to violence and monsters,\u201d he wrote in an essay in 2000. \u201cMy obsession is with photographing life at its most intense as intensely as possible. It\u2019s a mania, a virus as strong as my instinct to be free. If taste for life diminishes, the photographs pale, because taking pictures is like savoring life at 125th of a second. \u201d In 1961, he married Barbara Chase, the American sculptor, poet and novelist. The marriage ended in divorce in the 1980s. Besides his second wife, Ms. Chaine, a journalist and author, Mr. Riboud is survived by two sons from his first marriage, David and Alexei and a daughter, Cl\u00e9mence, and a son, Th\u00e9o, from his second marriage. Mr. Riboud\u2019s weakness for sentimental subjects and   causes marred his reputation with some critics. But this optimism, coupled with his overt sympathies for the downtrodden and a working style that put an emphasis on freedom of movement, unencumbered by any equipment except a camera and his wits, also served to keep him photographing until the end of his life. Until a few years ago, he would begin each day by loading film into his Canon EOS 300. \u201cMy vision of the world is simple,\u201d Mr. Riboud said when he was in his 80s. \u201cTomorrow, each new day, I want to see the city, take new photographs, meet people and wander alone. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561973.8758984}
