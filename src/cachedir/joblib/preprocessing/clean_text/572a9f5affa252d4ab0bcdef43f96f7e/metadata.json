Ryan\u2019s office is billing as his first major address on tax reform this year, and that Ryan will participate in a    session afterward. [This should be interesting.  Paul Ryan has zero experience with manufacturing. There is not one instance of Ryan ever holding a job managing manufacturing operations tasked with competing against local or foreign manufacturers. However, I\u2019ve run heavily engineered manufacturing businesses around the globe. So I\u2019ll take this opportunity to pose a few questions for Speaker Ryan that those in attendance might think about asking him: It\u2019s been reported Ryan will say something to the effect of, \u201cWith more jobs, higher wages, and a stronger economy, American workers and families would be the greatest beneficiaries of this reform,\u201d Ryan\u2019s office said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, following the principles outlined earlier this year by President Trump, the House, Senate, and administration are working together to meet this historic opportunity. \u201d Does Paul Ryan realize that foreign manufacturers will flock to the U. S. when the Corporate tax rate is dropped to 15 percent? Does Paul Ryan realize that the engine plant that left Kenosha for Canada did so because the tax rate in Canada is 15 percent? Does Paul Ryan realize that the GE plant that just announced it is leaving Waukesha is doing so because Canada offered $2B and a 15 percent tax rate? Canadian workers are inferior to American workers. I can say so with authority because I closed a Canadian factory in 2015 while with Neptune and brought those jobs back to America \u2014  more profitably I might add. While with Tyden and SPX, I moved Mexican and Chinese factory jobs back to the U. S. \u2014  again more profitably. I\u2019d do so again in a heartbeat. The Speaker\u2019s office last week said Ryan chose to give the speech at the NAM conference because one of his goals is to encourage companies to bring jobs back to the U. S. That\u2019s odd. Then why would you refuse to do the one thing that would drive that more than any other, reduce the Corporate Tax rate to 15 percent like President Trump suggests? \u201cWe want tax reform now. We think it\u2019s really important,\u201d said Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy at NAM. The Hill reported that she added that it\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent that the U. S. tax code is holding businesses back. It is very encouraging: NAM is one of several prominent business groups that has not taken a stance on the border adjustments proposal. NAM should take this opportunity to reject the BAT and endorse President Trump\u2019s 15 percent Corporate tax. Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) have touted the BAT as \u201cremoving the Made In America tax. \u201d That\u2019s just, as my grandfather would say, hogwash. Paul Nehlen is not another lifelong politician, but a business executive and inventor. Nehlen started out on the factory floor, and through God\u2019s grace, grit, and determination rose to lead Fortune 500 manufacturing businesses around the world. Nehlen challenged Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin\u2019s 2016 First Congressional District to stop   Partnership and secure America\u2019s border. Today he is waging the battle against the refugee resettlement racket and leading the cause to fight for America\u2019s values. Nehlen has announced he is challenging Ryan in the 2018 Wisconsin First Congressional District primary. He lives in Delavan, Wisconsin.'"}, "time": 1742563294.751218}
