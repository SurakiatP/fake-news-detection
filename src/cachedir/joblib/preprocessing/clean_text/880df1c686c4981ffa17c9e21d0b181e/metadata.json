Some South Koreans aren\u2019t waiting to die to find out. It\u2019s become a trend in recent years to act out a mock funeral service as a way of better appreciating life. The Hyowon Healing Center in Seoul runs one such program, with financial backing from a funeral service company. After an instructional lecture and video, participants are led into a dimly lit hall decorated with chrysanthemums, where they sit, often tearfully, beside caskets and write their last testaments. Then they put on burial shrouds and lie down in the coffins. A   man dressed in a black robe, \u201cthe Envoy from the Other World,\u201d hammers the lids closed. The participants are left encased in utter darkness for 10 minutes  \u2014   which can feel like an eternity. \u201cThere was not a single ray of light coming in, and how I cried in the dark, suffocating coffin!\u201d a recent participant wrote in a blog post. Jeong   the director of the Hyowon program, said 15, 000 people had gone through mock funerals at the center since 2012. The program is free. Some participants had terminal illnesses and wanted help preparing for the end others had suicidal impulses that they wanted to dispel. Businesses send employees as part of a motivational program. At the end of the      session, Mr. Jeong tells the participants: \u201cNow, you have shed your old self. You are reborn to have a fresh start!\u201d It takes a few minutes for them to readjust, but soon they are chatting, laughing and taking selfies with their coffins. Mr. Jeong said he keeps an eye out for the few morbid souls who seem to feel a little too \u201ccomfortable in the coffin. \u201d But most participants say they feel strangely refreshed afterward, gaining a new perspective on the things that matter in life, like family. \u201cI feel my heart pumping,\u201d one participant wrote in a blog post, where she confessed to having thought about suicide before the mock funeral service. \u201cI am alive!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563877.7527828}
