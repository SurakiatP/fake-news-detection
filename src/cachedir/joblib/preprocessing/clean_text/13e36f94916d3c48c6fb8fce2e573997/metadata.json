In \u201cPalas por Pistolas\u201d (\u201cShovels for Guns\u201d) in 2008, he set up a program that allowed residents of Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico, a city devastated by shootings, to trade in their guns for food stamps or household appliances the guns, more than 1, 500 of them, were melted down and turned into shovels. In a 2013 work with similar implications for good but a much higher threshold for rethinking, he came up with the   a burger made with plentiful, crunchy grasshopper protein instead of beef. But when he and the New York public art organization Creative Time began discussing a piece to coincide with the homestretch of the American presidential campaign, Mr. Reyes settled on an idea that allowed little in the way of light: the professional haunted house, an essentially American creation (by way of Grand Guignol and Victorian ghostiana) for generating shock and fear. \u201cThe haunted house has never really been considered an art form, but it\u2019s a true folk art  \u2014   every town has one at Halloween,\u201d said Mr. Reyes, whose own version, \u201cDoomocracy,\u201d opens Friday within the sprawling Brooklyn Army Terminal in the Sunset Park neighborhood. \u201cHaunted houses don\u2019t have a narrative or make sense. You\u2019re there to be terrified, to be a masochist. So those are the limits I decided to work within for this. \u201d Or, as Nato Thompson, Creative Time\u2019s artistic director, puts it: \u201cWe sometimes joke that this is a     where no matter which path you choose you always die. \u201d If that seems like a bleak metaphor for Clinton vs. Trump  \u2014   or \u201cBrexit,\u201d or the failed Syrian   or the surprise electoral defeat of the Colombian peace plan or any number of world political morasses  \u2014   it well could be. \u201cThe strange thing about this project is that the worse things are in the news, the better it is for us,\u201d Mr. Reyes, 44, said early this week in Brooklyn, preparing for final   with a group of nearly 50 actors, under the direction of Meghan Finn, who will play all manner of ghouls  \u2014   business executives, police officers, poll workers, drone pilots, overprescribing doctors  \u2014   within the haunted house. But Mr. Reyes added that the house\u2019s   fright scenarios are less about the failures of political leaders and more about systems at work in the world economy  \u2014   the military complex, the financial industry, the gun industry, the   industry and Big Pharma, just to name some headliners  \u2014   that have become so vast they seem to govern themselves, rendering political control almost ineffectual. And making satire a tall order. For example, one room of \u201cDoomocracy\u201d (through Nov. 6, groups of a dozen will be led through the rooms at timed intervals beginning at 6 p. m.) is a cozy, profoundly creepy funeral home, presided over by an   undertaker who explains that the home specializes in coffins made in the shape of the   item most loved by the deceased. A   coffin in the shape of a   Twinkie dominated the room on a recent visit. And during a rehearsal in September, an actor tinkled the organ keys, intoning earnestly: \u201cI\u2019d like to think that in the afterlife, kids can taste their coffins and they\u2019re happy,\u201d enjoying \u201cthe milkshake coffin, the fried chicken coffin\u201d and many other available flavors. Then he crooned: \u201cEvery kid wants a candy coffin. \u201d In the interest of avoiding spoilers (something a   reporter rarely has to worry about) some of the scenarios in the piece are probably best undescribed. But it might give an idea of the range of topical phantasmagoria to say that one room involves cheerleaders singing about abortion. Another features a kind of Tupperware party for handguns. (\u201cI think for a lot of liberal people who have never been around guns, it\u2019s going to be a pretty tense situation,\u201d Mr. Reyes said.) There will be a classroom presided over by a racially   computer avatar spouting corporate   through a large computer screen  \u2014   \u201cI Googled \u2018classroom of the future,\u2019 and that\u2019s pretty much what it looked like,\u201d Mr. Reyes said  \u2014   and a fake cocktail party hosted by a rich couple who are having their own spaceship built. \u201cThey just have so much money that they\u2019re into racing space rockets,\u201d said Mr. Reyes, a compact, bespectacled man who comes off in person like a philosophy professor moonlighting as a   comedy host. \u201cThey asked Zaha Hadid to design their spaceship, but then she died, so of course they got Frank Gehry, who\u2019s done most of their houses. \u201d Ms. Finn, who once directed a play that took place inside a New York City taxi and along the streets it traversed, said that compared even with those logistical challenges, Mr. Reyes\u2019s project \u201cis crazy, totally nuts  \u2014   in the best possible way. \u201d The actors will have to repeat their parts, written by the playwright Paul Hufker  \u2014   some of them highly emotional and physically demanding  \u2014   40 times over the course of a night. \u201cWhen I enlisted people to be in this, I told them that it was going to be an act of political rigor,\u201d Ms. Finn said. \u201cIt really is endurance performance. \u201d Katie Hollander, Creative Time\u2019s executive director, said that the organization hadn\u2019t planned earlier in the year to present a major fall piece. But when Mr. Reyes proposed a \u201c  haunted house,\u201d she said, \u201cthe idea stuck with us, and as the political climate became more and more terrifying to a certain extent, it just became more and more relevant, and we knew that the time this had to happen was now. So we jumped from the frying pan into the fire. It\u2019s not a usual thing for us to do something of this complexity in such a short period of time. \u201d The Army Terminal, once the largest military supply base in the United States and now a center for light manufacturing, plays a starring role itself. Its towering main atrium, punctuated by concrete balconies once used for transfer of wartime supplies from train to ship, looks like a dystopian backdrop from \u201cBrazil\u201d or \u201cMetropolis. \u201d And the terminal\u2019s   emptiness will contribute, Mr. Reyes said, to a sense of isolation almost impossible to find in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s really pretty freaky here at night. \u201d Especially against the backdrop of this election, Mr. Thompson said, the project made a kind of perverse sense in 2016, the centennial of the birth of the Dada art movement. \u201cI think that\u2019s the kind of moment we\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like a joke but the joke is really not funny at all. \u201d Mr. Reyes acknowledged that the piece would probably be received far differently were it presented in suburban Ohio or rural Tennessee he knows he is preaching mostly to a choir of liberal art lovers who oppose many of the   demons he holds up to ridicule. \u201cBut I still very much hope I can offend at least a few people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be so intense that I think people are going to be shaken and pretty worn out after the hour they\u2019re inside. \u201d Which might be worth something in itself. \u201cThis piece\u2019s inner logic isn\u2019t about hope, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve lost hope in art\u2019s ability to help change things,\u201d Mr. Reyes said. \u201cI still think it\u2019s crucial to keep a critical muscle that mocks the motivations of the system  \u2014   to say, \u2018Why are we doing this?\u2019 and to say, \u2018This is crazy. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563959.8825564}
