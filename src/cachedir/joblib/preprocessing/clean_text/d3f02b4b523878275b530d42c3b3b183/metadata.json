After spending nearly eight years demonizing, obstructing, and criticizing every and anything about the President of the United States, Republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their \u201c imagined \u201d close ties to the Democratic President whose approval rating and popularity are growing. \\nIt is hypocritical, to say the least, and at some point a result of a toxic Republican candidate for the presidency, but for some GOP candidates it is a very dangerous strategy. If any Republican believed President Obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt, they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chief\u2019s tolerance during an election. \\nThe President is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate Republicans for either \u201c belated rejection \u201d or continued support of Donald Trump. President Obama is also reminding Republicans that \u201c Donald Trump is the endpoint of eight years of [GOP] toxic hostility .\u201d It may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that \u201c Obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every Republican who ever crossed him ,\u201d but he is getting some well-placed and well-warranted shots at Republicans. \\nTwo Republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the President\u2019s approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics; so it likely stunned the President that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed, opposed, and attempted to get rid of. \\nOhio Senator Rob Portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the President \u201cto break the grip of heroin addiction.\u201d President Obama took the time to excoriate Portman for, \\n\u201c Finally withdrawing his support from Donald Trump ,\u201d but only \u201c After looking at the polling. Now that it\u2019s politically expedient. But he has supported him up until last week? So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists \u2026 and insulting Gold Star moms, making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didn\u2019t quite tip it over the edge. Why was that OK? And now he says he will vote for the vice-presidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports Donald Trump. \u201d \\nThe President was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the President \u201c one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times,\u201d California Republican Representative Daryl Issa, is sending out campaign mailers with the President\u2019s face on them and boasting about his close work with President Obama \u201c to protect victims of sexual assault .\u201d \\nDaryl Issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the President\u2019s wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on Issa-created scandals. During a fundraiser in La Jolla California Sunday last, the President assailed Issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the President\u2019s image on it. The President said, \\n\u201c Issa\u2019s primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. This is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. Now that is the definition of chutzpah.\u201d \\nAs remarked by Tim Murphy at Mother Jones, President Obama is not just evening up the score with Republicans who made his tenure miserable, \u201c He is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight years\u2014to take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in Republicans\u2019 faces .\u201d \\nThe President clearly has a lot of \u201c words \u201d to harangue Republicans with. He said , \\n\u201c Here\u2019s the thing. For years, Republican politicians and the far-right media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me. About Hillary. About Harry. They said I wasn\u2019t born here. They said climate change is a hoax. They said that I was going to take everybody\u2019s guns away! They said that while we were doing military exercises that we\u2019ve been doing forever, suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law. This is what they\u2019ve been saying for years now! So people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe it\u2019s true! And if the world they\u2019ve been seeing is I\u2019m powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybody\u2019s guns in the middle of the night and impose martial law\u2014even though I can\u2019t talk without a \u2018prompter\u2014then is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like Donald Trump? \\nAnd the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. There are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what this\u2019ll help rile up the base, it\u2019ll give us an excuse to obstruct what we\u2019re trying to do, we won\u2019t be able to appoint judges, we\u2019ll gum up the works, we\u2019ll create gridlock, it\u2019ll give us a political advantage. So they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff. So Donald Trump did not start this. Donald Trump didn\u2019t start it, he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. That\u2019s what he always does. And so now, when suddenly it\u2019s not working and people are saying wow this guy\u2019s kind of out of line, all of a sudden these Republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly they\u2019re all walking away. Oh, this is too much. So when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly that\u2019s a deal-breaker. Well what took you so long! What the heck! What took you so long! All these years!\u201d \\nThe Mother Jones piece made out like President Obama is seeking retribution, or \u201c revenge \u201d against Republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years. Without knowing what goes on in the President\u2019s head to motivate his campaign rhetoric; that is a hard call to make with any surety. Barack Obama does not strike one as being vindictive. \\nThe President is, though, an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the White House is winding down and Republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from Donald Trump, it is prudent of the President to remind voters exactly what Republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why Donald Trump is their standard bearer; and why Republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning Trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the White House.\""}, "time": 1742564072.6120687}
