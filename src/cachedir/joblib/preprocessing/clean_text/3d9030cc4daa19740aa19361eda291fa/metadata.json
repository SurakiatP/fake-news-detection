Claire McCaskill Thursday, after she swiped at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for privately meeting with Kislyak in 2016 and failing to disclose it when asked about communications with Russians during his confirmation proceedings in January. Sessions has emphasized that meetings with ambassadors are common for lawmakers and that he met with Kislyak in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. McCaskill tweeted that in her 10 years serving on the Armed Services Committee she had never \u201cever\u201d met with Kislyak, but walked back her comment by using the same reasoning as Pelosi, saying she had never met with him   .'"}, "time": 1742562404.9125206}
