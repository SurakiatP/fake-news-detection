In its list, the news organization went over the \u201cpay-for-play\u201d scheme involving the Clinton Foundation, going so far as to mention an email confirming the king of Morocco offered $12m \u201cfor the endowment\u201d \u2014 as long as Clinton was willing to take part in a meeting.\\nNevertheless, the state-funded broadcaster failed to bring up the Qatar connection. Unfortunately for the organization, Wikileaks promptly noticed the omission.\\nIn a post on Facebook , the WikiLeaks official page said, \u201c Al Jazeera\u2019s list of juiciest Wikileaks forgets to mention the revelation that Qatar funds both ISIS & Bill Clinton. \u201d\\nOn Twitter, the convenient lapse wasn\u2019t forgiven. Promptly after WikiLeaks pointed out the omission, users began pressuring Al Jazeera to explain why the publication failed to link Qatar to ISIS and Clinton.\\nAl Jazeera's list of juiciest WikiLeaks forgets to mention the revelation that Qatar funds both ISIS & Bill Clinton: https://t.co/aBIuF861kk \\n\u2014 Max Abrahms (@MaxAbrahms) October 25, 2016 \\n\\n@MaxAbrahms @wikileaks You mean @AlJazeera is not critical of Qatar?

Or is the media\u2019s refusal to cover this topic rooted in fear that thoroughly addressing it will help her lose the presidential election?\\nOnly time will tell.\\nThis article ( Hillary Admits In Leaked Email That Clinton Donors Are Funding ISIS ) is free and open source.
