It\u2019s estimated that around 4,328 barrels worth of oil were spilled in this period. \\nIn an another case, a break in a Tesoro Corp. pipeline resulted in approximately 20,600 barrels of oil spreading over an area the size of seven football fields. Officials claimed that no wildlife or water sources were harmed by the spill, which apparently led them to conclude that the public did not need to be notified.\\nThe only incident in which the public was notified was an instance in which an oil truck was involved in a collision in 2012.\\nWhile many of these spills were relatively small and arguably had little environmental impact, landowners expressed outrage that they were kept out of the loop. North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources director Lynn Helms said that they didn\u2019t want the public to become \u201coverwhelmed by little incidents.\u201d\\nHowever, landowners like wheat farmer Louis Kuster said it is \u201cabsolutely important for us to know\u201d if spills of any kind occur, particularly given his livelihood\u2019s reliance on the health of his land. Even a single barrel of spilled oil has the potential to ruin water sources and acres upon acres of valuable cropland.\\n\u201cRight now, you don\u2019t know if there is a spill unless you find it yourself,\u201d Kuster said.\\nWhile the release of AP\u2019s report ultimately led to more regulations obliging the public release of reported oil spills, including an online database of spills accessible to the public , this history of secrecy provides a troubling context for the Sioux Tribe\u2019s distrust of the DAPL pipeline construction.\\nThe Sioux Tribe says that the pipeline \u201cthreatens the Tribe\u2019s environmental and economic well-being, and would damage and destroy sites of great historic, religious, and cultural significance to the Tribe.\u201d\\nIn a tense standoff with heavily armed police forces, dozens of protesters \u2013 referring to themselves as peaceful water protectors \u2013 were arrested today for demonstrating against the construction of the pipeline on what police say is private property.\\nNathan Wellman is a Los Angeles-based journalist, author, and playwright.

Along the entire pipeline route, residents fear erosion and runoff problems (including many Iowa farmers), but there is no mitigation mentioned in official documents for the butterfly\u2019s sensitive, federally protected areas in McKenzie County.\\nBesides bulldozing areas near protected species\u2019 enclaves, private capital has brought with it private agents of violence to impose its will. Controversial private security forces involved with violently forcing aside pipeline opponents include 10 Code LLC , based in nearby Bismarck, ND.
