[CNN reports that, according to officials familiar with the matter, the U. S. is preparing charges to seek the arrest of Assange, who has resided within the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012. The Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Assange has been underway since 2010 when WikiLeaks first published classified documents obtained by US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.  Prosecutors first had issues pressing charges as they debated whether the information published by WikiLeaks fell under the First Amendment, but now believe that they have discovered a way to move forward. During the Obama administration, Attorney General Eric Holder and other Justice Department Officials determined that due to WikiLeaks not being the sole publisher of the documents, prosecution would be difficult. This lead to the investigation being put on hold. Following the Ecuadorian election, US officials hoped that Assange\u2019s asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy would be revoked with a new government. However, after the victory of Len\u00edn Moreno over his opponent Guillermo Lasso, Assange will most likely be permitted to continue living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Moreno previously stated that he would allow Assange to stay in the embassy, upholding the decision made by his predecessor, Rafael Correa, who granted Assange asylum in 2012. CIA Director Mike Pompeo had harsh words for WikiLeaks while speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies today, implying that the whistleblowing group was a \u201chostile intelligence service. \u201d Pompeo was quite open about his disdain for the whistleblowing service following their recent publishing of CIA hacking tools as part of their \u201cVault 7\u201d leaks. Pompeo stating during his speech, It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is  \u2014   a   hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia. In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence  \u2014   the GRU  \u2014   had used WikiLeaks to release data of US victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee. And the report also found that Russia\u2019s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks. Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated on Thursday that arresting Assange was a \u201cpriority\u201d for the administration. \u201cWe are going to step up our effort and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a matter that\u2019s gone beyond anything I\u2019m aware of. We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious. So yes, it is a priority. We\u2019ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail. \u201d Assange\u2019s lawyer, Barry Pollak, stated \u201cWe\u2019ve had no communication with the Department of Justice and they have not indicated to me that they have brought any charges against Mr. Assange. They\u2019ve been unwilling to have any discussion at all, despite our repeated requests, that they let us know what Mr. Assange\u2019s status is in any pending investigations. There\u2019s no reason why WikiLeaks should be treated differently from any other publisher. \u201d Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, has argued that prosecuting Assange could set a dangerous precedent, \u201cNever in the history of this country has a publisher been prosecuted for presenting truthful information to the public,\u201d Wizner told CNN. \u201cAny prosecution of WikiLeaks for publishing government secrets would set a dangerous precedent that the Trump administration would surely use to target other news organizations. \u201d Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
