Uncertainty about their own health and the health of their children, the   nature of the crisis, and raw anger over government\u2019s role in both causing the lead contamination and trying to remedy it, are all taking their toll on Flint\u2019s residents. \u201cThe first thing I noticed when I got to Flint, quite honestly, was the level of fear and anxiety and distress,\u201d said Dr. Nicole Lurie, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services who has been coordinating the federal recovery effort here since January. On Wednesday, President Obama will pay his first visit to the city since the lead contamination was revealed. A team of behavioral health specialists from the United States Public Health Service began addressing the mental health problem in February by providing \u201cpsychological first aid\u201d training for people interested in helping others cope with the water emergency. Genesee Health System, a local mental health agency, also created the Flint Community Resilience Group, whose members are focusing on the   psychological consequences of the water crisis and how to address them. With a $500, 000 emergency grant from the state, the group is offering free crisis counseling at churches and the public library, and has held two community meetings on stress management. Social workers and social work students from around the state are helping with the counseling on a volunteer basis. But the need probably extends far beyond the 400 people who have been helped since the counseling started in February. Diane Breckenridge, Genesee Health\u2019s liaison to local hospitals, said she had seen \u201cpeople come into the hospitals directly related to breakdowns, nervous breakdowns, if you will. \u201d \u201cMost of it\u2019s been depression or suicidal ideation directly linked to what\u2019s going on with their children,\u201d she added. \u201cThey just feel like they can\u2019t even let their children take a bath. \u201d Children, too, are traumatized, said Dexter Clarke, a supervisor at Genesee Health, not least because they constantly hear frightening things on television about the lead crisis, including breathless advertisements by personal injury lawyers seeking clients. \u201cI teach a   class of little girls every Wednesday, and they\u2019re from Flint,\u201d Ms. Breckenridge said, \u201cand I just get all kinds of questions because they\u2019re terrified. \u201d A bill in the United States House of Representatives would provide $5 million for mental health needs in Flint as part of a broader aid package, but has not gotten traction. A separate aid package in the Senate appears to have more momentum, but does not include money for mental health. The state, meanwhile, is planning to send mobile crisis teams into Flint neighborhoods and to provide help to local pediatricians through a child psychiatric teleprogram. Michigan\u2019s earlier decision to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act will help more   residents get psychological help, although officials at Genesee Health System worry about not having enough licensed social workers to meet the eventual demand. About 15, 000 additional children and pregnant women here will be eligible for Medicaid, possibly starting this month, under a temporary program that government and local officials are rushing to put together. One challenge is convincing people to seek mental health care. The Rev. Rigel J. Dawson, pastor of the North Central Church of Christ and a member of the Flint Community Resilience Group, said his focus was on persuading   residents of the   city to pursue psychological help if they need it. \u201cThere\u2019s a history, especially in the   church, of \u2018I\u2019m strong enough spiritually to deal with it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dawson said. \u201cYou see the signs of stress and what it\u2019s doing to the community, but we\u2019re conditioned to put on our church face and act like it\u2019s O. K. \u201d Danis Russell, the chief executive of Genesee Health System, said that while the potential for stigma had kept many here from seeking mental health services in the past, the water crisis might make them more willing. \u201cNow there\u2019s an acceptable reason,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople may say: \u2018This isn\u2019t my fault. Somebody did this to us and everybody\u2019s getting help, so I should, too. \u2019\u201d Still, Mr. Russell added, \u201cWhat the demand will look like going forward, I don\u2019t think anyone knows. \u201d Five Flint residents recently shared their accounts of the psychological impact of the crisis: Janice Berryman spends solitary days in a home scattered with pink pillows and angel figurines, following every twist of Flint\u2019s water crisis on television and trying to keep her anger at bay. Her tap water was found to have extremely high lead levels as recently as February, she said. Family members have stopped visiting, including a niece in Arkansas whose twin toddlers Ms. Berryman, 71, is aching to meet. Sometimes her loneliness brings her to tears, she said. For a while she found it helped to attend protests, and she even took a bus to Lansing in January to march outside the Capitol during Gov. Rick Snyder\u2019s State of the State address. But with heart disease, diabetes and other ailments, \u201cI just said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to back down. \u2019\u201d She began sleeping a lot  \u2014   too much, her relatives told her. \u201cIf you go to sleep, it feels like it\u2019s all going to go away,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it don\u2019t. \u201d Her doctor has persuaded her to try the crisis counseling at the public library. \u201cHe said, \u2018I think you need to, Jan, just to get your feelings out,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s working? Adios. If they try to start pushing pills on me, I\u2019ll be gone. I don\u2019t need a bunch of pills to drug me up. \u201d Two of Ms. Berryman\u2019s siblings died young, experiences that she said had forced her to learn endurance. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I handle this a little better than others,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what your anger level is, God sees you through. \u201d Bob and Johanna Atwood Brown thought they were doing everything right. When reports of lead in the water supply surfaced last summer, they installed a filter on their faucet, which removes lead up to 150 parts per billion. They used bottled water for drinking, but relied on their filtered tap water for cooking, coffee or to make their    son and his friends   on hot summer days. But when they had their water tested in January, they learned that it contained lead at 200 parts per billion  \u2014   more than their filter was designed to handle, and far more than the federal safety threshold of 15 parts per billion. Ms. Brown said she was haunted by thoughts of her son and his friends drinking the lemonade and   she had made them. \u201cThe guilt is unreal,\u201d she said. \u201cI poisoned other people\u2019s children. \u201d Mr. Brown said he felt as if he had failed as a father and protector of his family. \u201cYou beat yourself up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we do something earlier? Why didn\u2019t we test earlier?\u201d Their son received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and attention deficit disorder before the water crisis, and the Browns said they feared that the lead could exacerbate those problems  \u2014   or produce others. He \u201chas special needs as it is, so it\u2019s hard to tell if there\u2019s a behavioral component,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cThings are not clear. \u201d She added: \u201cAre we going to get cancer from this? I\u2019m terrified. \u201d As an outlet, Ms. Brown has started a blog and uses Facebook. She was already seeing a therapist, she said, but now the stress and guilt associated with her home\u2019s water contamination dominate her sessions. Mr. Brown said he did not talk about it much, but as the associate director in Flint for Michigan State University\u2019s Center for Economic and Community Development, he finds it therapeutic to share his story when he speaks at events and meetings. \u201cIt never leaves you,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAt some point you just want to jump up and down and yell and scream, and then you just try to move forward. Because what are you going to say?\u201d Too often now, Nicole Lewis cannot sleep. \u201cI\u2019m up until midnight some nights because I can\u2019t shut down,\u201d she said. \u201cJust thinking about my life in general  \u2014   like really, did I deserve this? Did my kids deserve this?\u201d Ms. Lewis, a    accountant and single mother of two boys, said she had also been experiencing chest pains. When they come, she lies down and drinks bottled water. \u201cYet I\u2019ve been told that this bottled water could have lead, too,\u201d she said, voicing a common concern here. To help her nerves, she recently installed a home water filtration system, paying $42. 50 a month for the service on her main water supply line. She also bought a blender to make her sons smoothies with   vegetables, like spinach and kale. But still her mind races, especially late at night. Her    was just found to have attention deficit disorder, she said. Her    is already showing athletic promise, but she wonders whether lead exposure will affect his ability to play sports. She also worries that living in Flint will brand her as damaged goods if she ever tries to find a job elsewhere. \u201cWhen they see my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will they say, \u2018Oh wait, she\u2019s from Flint  \u2014   she might be a huge liability for us\u2019?\u201d she said. She has no time for a therapist, she said, but regularly talks to her mother in Houston. \u201cI just vent a lot of stuff out to her,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a listening ear. \u201d As if there were not enough putting Maelores Collins on edge, her dog will not stop barking. She suspects Flint\u2019s water is to blame. \u201cI think he\u2019s hallucinating,\u201d she said as Wally, a Yorkshire terrier, yapped from a cage near the back door. \u201cWe need to get him tested. \u201d The barking adds to a sense of disorder that has agitated Ms. Collins, 48, for months. She is tired of the water bottles cluttering her house, and of eating only microwaved food because she fears cooking with even filtered tap water. Small kindnesses, like her sister bringing over potpies from Kentucky Fried Chicken, keep her going. Ms. Collins blames the water for a problem that deeply troubles her: Her hair has broken off over the past six months. Her   therapy consists of cruising the aisles of Walmart or playing bid whist, a card game, with friends. A few months ago, her doctor also prescribed Xanax, a tranquilizer, which she takes \u201cto get up\u201d in the morning, she said. \u201cI\u2019m depressed, I\u2019m angry, my anxiety is running high,\u201d said Ms. Collins, a former construction worker who has asthma and is on permanent disability. Worse off, she said, is her    grandson, who refuses to drink even bottled water and will eat only off paper plates. The family jumped several hurdles to secure a psychiatric appointment for him in early May. \u201cHe\u2019s freaking out  \u2014   he\u2019s like, \u2018We\u2019re all going to die from the water,\u2019\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re young, you ain\u2019t going nowhere.\u2019 But I can\u2019t convince this boy. \u201d Ms. Collins called the situation \u201ccrazy. \u201d \u201cLose your hair, your family tripping about different things, your kids leaving water bottles all over the house,\u201d she said. She laughed sharply. Wally continued his frantic barking, and she cast a withering glance his way. \u201cThis thing,\u201d she said, \u201cwill never be over. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563788.208479}
