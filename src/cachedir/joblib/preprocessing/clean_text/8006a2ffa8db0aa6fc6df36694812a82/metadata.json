Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Monday that the Fed was shifting its focus from stimulating the economy to keeping growth on an even keel. She said the economy was \u201cpretty healthy,\u201d thanks in part to the Fed\u2019s   stimulus campaign, which the central bank is moving to end. \u201cLooking forward, I think the economy is going to continue to grow at a moderate pace,\u201d Ms. Yellen said during an event at the University of Michigan. \u201cOur job is going to be to try to set monetary policy to sustain what we have achieved. \u201d The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in March for the third time since the financial crisis, and said it planned two more rate increases this year. The Fed also said it planned to begin reducing its large holdings of securities by the end of the year. Ms. Yellen did not offer any additional details during her appearance on Monday. Ms. Yellen, interviewed onstage by Susan M. Collins, the dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the university, used the opportunity to make a strong case for the financial regulations enacted by Congress in the 2010   Act to address the problems revealed by the 2008 financial crisis. President Trump and congressional Republicans have said they want to eliminate or overhaul many of those measures, which they regard as ineffective in preventing future financial crises and as impediments to economic growth. Ms. Yellen pushed back on both counts. She cited changes that she said had increased the strength of the financial system, including requiring banks to raise more money from investors and subjecting large banks to annual stress tests. \u201cWe have accomplished a lot, and we have a much safer system,\u201d she said. She also directly addressed the argument that the regulatory pendulum has swung too far and that government rules are preventing healthy financial activity. \u201cI don\u2019t think if you look at objective data on lending, that it\u2019s possible to make the case that regulation has simply stifled lending,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cLending is growing in a very healthy way as the economy has recovered. \u201d She said banks were actually in a better position to lend, although she acknowledged that the Fed would like to reduce the burden on smaller banks. Ms. Yellen\u2019s assessment of economic conditions remained upbeat. She noted that the unemployment rate, which fell to 4. 5 percent in March, is now below the level that most Fed officials regard as sustainable. Consumer spending is growing at a decent pace, and Ms. Yellen noted that the global economy was also looking \u201cslightly more robust and healthier. \u201d Though inflation remains a bit weaker than the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy, she said it would be appropriate for the Fed to keep raising interest rates. She said, however, that the economy still faced problems that were beyond the power of monetary policy. While job growth has been strong, economic growth remains relatively slow, around 2 percent a year in recent years. If more people are working, making more things or doing more things in less time, the economy should be growing faster. \u201cThe fact that you can create that many jobs in the context of growth that is so low points to a significant problem,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cAnd the problem is that productivity growth is very low. \u201d Productivity measures the average person\u2019s economic contribution. There are only two possible causes of economic growth: more people or increased productivity, which is to say, the same number of people making more stuff. We have slow population growth and slow productivity growth, so we have slow economic growth. Economists regard the slow pace of productivity growth as something of a mystery. Ms. Yellen tipped her hat to a number of the theories in circulation. Some economists think the flow of good ideas has simply slowed. Others point to a   in educational attainment. She also pointed to recent research that suggested one factor was a decline in corporate competition: less creation of new businesses and more corporate consolidation. Ms. Yellen said the combination of relatively fast job growth and relatively slow economic growth pointed to the underlying problem. She also fielded some lighter questions. Asked how she dealt with pressure, Ms. Yellen described herself as an \u201cardent believer\u201d in the importance of a good night\u2019s sleep. Asked for life advice, she encouraged students to find a profession that fills them with a sense of enthusiasm every day. \u201cFor me,\u201d she said, \u201cthe core of having a satisfying career first and foremost was finding something to do that I really love. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564099.703576}
