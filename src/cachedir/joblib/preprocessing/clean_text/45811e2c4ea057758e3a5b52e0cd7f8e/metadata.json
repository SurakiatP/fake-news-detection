The meeting took less than a minute, according to her lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith. On Wednesday, Ms. Carlson sent shock waves through the media world when she filed a lawsuit against the powerful Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, accusing him, among other things, of sexual harassment and sexism. The news channel\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, said that it was conducting an internal review of the matter. Mr. Ailes denied the charges, and said that the \u201cdisappointingly low ratings\u201d for Ms. Carlson\u2019s show was the reason she was let go. \u201cWhen Fox News did not commence any negotiations to renew her contract, Ms. Carlson became aware that her career with the network was likely over and conveniently began to pursue a lawsuit,\u201d he said in a statement. Though a prominent personality at Fox for many years, Ms. Carlson does not have the star power at the network of Megyn Kelly or Bill O\u2019Reilly. But within minutes of the lawsuit going public, Ms. Carlson became a person of enormous interest in the world of television news. Ms. Carlson grew up in Anoka, Minn. where the future Congresswoman Michele Bachmann was one of her childhood nannies. She attended Stanford University, studying organizational behavior, though she did spend a year abroad at Oxford University focusing on the work of Virginia Woolf, Ms. Smith said. Before her senior year, she became a contestant in the Miss America beauty pageant, which she won in 1988. A trained violinist, Ms. Carlson was proud of her achievement, saying her victory proved the pageant was as interested in a contestant\u2019s intelligence as her looks. \u201cIt shows that I\u2019m not a bimbo, that I do have intelligence and that I do represent what every woman wants to be in this society, which is a career woman, and be respected for her intelligence,\u201d she said in January 1989. After graduating from Stanford, she worked for several local TV stations before becoming the host of the Saturday edition of CBS\u2019s   morning show, \u201cThe Early Show,\u201d in 2002. \u201cShe was very, very serious and competent and ambitious about doing journalism the way CBS News was known for,\u201d Victor Neufeld, an executive producer of \u201cThe Early Show,\u201d said on Wednesday. She joined Fox News\u2019 morning show \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d in 2006,   it for eight years. In 2009, Jon Stewart devoted a segment of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d to Ms. Carlson, showing clips of her saying she had to Google words like czar and ignoramus to learn their definitions. Mr. Stewart then detailed her stellar educational background, accused her of playing dumb for Fox\u2019s audience and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stash your I. Q. in an offshore account. \u201d Ms. Carlson is married to Casey Close, a sports agent known for his tough negotiating style, and a roster of clients that includes Derek Jeter. The couple have two children. She has been upfront in discussing matters of sexism in the workplace. In September 2013, shortly after she was removed from \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d she appeared on the Fox News Radio show of her former   Brian Kilmeade and noted that she was dressed casually. The morning show, she said, had a strict rule: She could not wear pants on air. The year before, Ms. Carlson walked off the set of \u201cFox and Friends\u201d in apparent protest when Mr. Kilmeade made a disparaging comment about women. (She later said she was joking.) And last year Ms. Carlson wrote about sexual harassment for The Huffington Post. \u201cMost professional women I know have experienced sexual harassment,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo have I  \u2014   a few times  \u2014   and I never talked about it until now. If that seems surprising, it shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019ve always considered myself a strong woman, not afraid to stand up for myself, but in the face of sexual harassment I was silent. \u201cAs the issue takes a prominent place in the headlines today, I sometimes feel guilty about my trepidation,\u201d Ms. Carlson continued. \u201cPerhaps I could have moved the conversation forward if I had come forth. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563180.4959826}
