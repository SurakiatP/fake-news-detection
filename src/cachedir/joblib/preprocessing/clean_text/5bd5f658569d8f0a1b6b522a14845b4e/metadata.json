[The poll found that 86 percent of respondents \u201cstrongly or somewhat approve\u201d of the job that Donald Trump is doing, compared to just 12 percent who somewhat or strongly disapprove of his work so far. Two percent said they were unsure.   When asked which issue was the most important to them, 46 percent of respondents pointed to the economy  \u2014   encompassing jobs, taxes, and government spending  \u2014   as the most important issue.  Meanwhile, 29 percent said that issues of national security and fighting radical Islam remained their number one issue, while 13 percent said that changing social attitudes on issues such as abortion, protecting the family, and religious freedom are their personal priority.  However, just 44 percent of respondents said that the country is now going in the right direction, while 47 per cent believe it remains on the wrong track.  A total of 1, 447 CPAC attendees participated in the poll, all of whom are likely to have conservative leanings due to the nature of the conference. The poll was completed both by hand and via email.  You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742562000.0364814}
