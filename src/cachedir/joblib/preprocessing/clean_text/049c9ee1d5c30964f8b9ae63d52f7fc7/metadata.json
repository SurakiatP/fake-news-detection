(SatireWire.com) \u2013 Pushed to the limits of pain by an election that was initially entertaining but has clearly gotten out of hand, Americans today are frantically trying to remember the safe word that will stop this sadistic presidential race before it ends badly. \\n\u201cHonestly, at first I thought it was just a little role-playing,\u201d said Jessica Riley, 44, of Austin, Texas. \u201cDonald Trump as President Trump? I was like, \u2018It feels so wrong, but I can\u2019t turn away.\u2019 But then the FBI jumped into the race with more emails and suddenly I was like, \u2018Oh God no, Donald Trump actually is going to be president! Apple! Baseball! Putin!\u2019\u201d \\n\u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t think of what it was!\u201d added desperate 28-year-old Clay Toombs of Charlotte, N.C. \u201cPineapple? Oklahoma? Mussolini? Just please stop! And no I am not kidding, and no I am not saying this because I really want you to keep going! I mean it!\u201d \\nW ith the election only days away, voters said they probably should have ended this dark, \u201850 Shades of Orange\u2019 fantasy sooner, but conceded they didn\u2019t recognize how abusive things would become. \\n\u201cOK, intially it did spice things up,\u201d said Seattle resident Taylor Bryant, 38. \u201cTrump was really pushing the boundaries. He was into all the kinky stuff like gagging the press, handcuffing immigrants, stop and frisk. Plus he had this whole prison fantasy with Hillary. But then he got over-the-top dirty \u2013 pussy grabbing, blood coming out of her wherever, and, c\u2019mon, suggesting he\u2019d like to get it on with his daughter? \\n\u201cI draw the line at scarring,\u201d Bryant added. \u201cI don\u2019t want any visible scars, and right now I feel scarred for life.\u201d \\nLike many voters, D.T. Fillion, 56, of Clemson, S.C., said he wishes the election campaign had never taken place. \\n\u201cIf what happened in 2016 could stay in 2016, that\u2019d be great,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just say it was a phase. And hope my kids don\u2019t find out.\u201d \\nCarolyn Frate of Brooklyn, meanwhile, said she\u2019s no longer excited by either candidate. \\n\u201cIf we could just have Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, I know that would be, like, the electoral missionary position, but right now I could do with boring,\u201d she said. \\nFor the record, the safe word is \u201cVote.\u201d \\n\u00a9 2016 SatireWire.com'"}, "time": 1742564075.620398}
