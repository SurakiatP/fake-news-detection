Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but you\u2019d never know it given the ridiculous display by the Obamas on the campaign trail. Fortunately, a pro-Donald Trump super PAC decided to remind America\u2026 and Hillary Clinton is not too happy about it. \\nBuzzfeed reported : \\nThe Clinton campaign has sent cease and desist letters to at least four local television stations in Florida demanding they stop running an ad paid for by a pro-Trump Super PAC featuring First Lady Michelle Obama \u2014 even as the PAC is expanding its ad campaign in North Carolina. \\nThe ad, titled \u201cCan\u2019t Run Her House,\u201d is being run through the Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC, a subsidiary of the Make America Number 1 PAC, which is backing Trump\u2019s campaign. \\nDuring the 2008 presidential primary campaign, Michelle Obama said: \\nOne of the important aspects of this race is role-modeling what good families should look like. And my view is, if you can\u2019t run your own house, you certainly can\u2019t run the White House. You can\u2019t do it. \\nBarack Obama laughably claimed that the comment wasn\u2019t about Clinton, but who else would it have been about? That\u2019s what liberals do, though; they just deny something ever happened or wasn\u2019t what it obviously was \u2014 and thanks to the biased mainstream media, they get away with it. \\nHogan Gidley, the PAC\u2019s spokesperson, said of the legal move by the Clinton campaign: \\nHillary\u2019s just angry because the ad is impactful, it\u2019s working and it speaks directly to the women she\u2019s been trying to con for years. Hillary\u2019s own campaign said when Michelle Obama speaks out, \u201cit has a real impact,\u201d and indeed, we agree \u2013 because it was Mrs. Obama who correctly pointed out Hillary Clinton \u201ccertainly can\u2019t run the White House.\u201d \\nTake a look at the ad below: \\nYou know, it really seems as if most Democrats are unable to just tell the truth. It looks pretty ridiculous for the Obamas to glowingly support Clinton and for Clinton to speak glowingly about the Obamas after the things they all said back in 2008. \\nPart of the problem with Democrats is that they have the media in the tank for them, so they don\u2019t have to own up to anything. Besides, it\u2019s not like their moral compass, the ones that actually have one, would force them to do so. \\nFor the Clinton camp to resort to legal action over an ad that simply points out their hypocrisy is the height of absurdity. If you can\u2019t stand the heat, don\u2019t make deals with the devil \u2026 '"}, "time": 1742564550.0370493}
