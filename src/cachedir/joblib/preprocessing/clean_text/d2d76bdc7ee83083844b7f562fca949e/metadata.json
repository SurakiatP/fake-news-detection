The \u201cShadow Government\u201d \u2014 the exact term used in the FBI document \u2014 included among its \u201cknown regular attendees\u201d some well-known and powerful people. \\nThe FBI document, which is heavily redacted in some places, is dated August 24, 2015, and was made public earlier this month. It includes information from an FBI \u201cinterview of [redacted]\u201d on August 19, 2015 and addresses the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests which had been made in regard to Clinton\u2019s e-mails. The document reveals some of the process about what was redacted from those e-mails before they were released as part of those FOIA requests. On page 56 of the document, it says: Most of the items with CIA redactions were emails from Sidney BLUMENTHAL. One item was deemed classified according to the FBI and Kennedy held a closed door meeting attended by the FBI\u2019s [redacted] and IPS\u2019 [redacted] among others. In that meeting, KENNEDY asked [redacted] to change the FBI\u2019s B(1) upgrade classification, but [redacted] did not change the FBI\u2019s stance. On May 22, it was decided by the IPS team they would keep the upgrade of the one FBI-related email and the IPS officials sent David KENDALL, Attorney, Williams & Connolly, LLC, a letter informing him of the results. \\nAside from the element of showing how the sausage is made in backroom \u201cclosed door\u201d meetings, the document also includes some damning information in the next paragraph. It tells of a \u201cpowerful group of very high-ranking STATE officials\u201d referred to as \u201cThe Shadow Government,\u201d which met weekly \u201cto discuss the FOIA process, Congressional records, and everything CLINTON-related to FOIA/Congressional inquiries.\u201d The document says: There was a powerful group of very high-ranking STATE officials that some referred to as \u201cThe 7th Floor Group\u201d or \u201cThe Shadow Government.\u201d This group met every Wednesday afternoon to discuss the FOIA process, Congressional records, and everything CLINTON-related to FOIA/Congressional inquiries. The known regular attendees included Jonathan FINER, Chief of Staff for Secretary of State John KERRY, Jennifer STOUT, Deputy Chief of Staff, Heather HIGGENBOTTOM, Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources [Patrick] Kennedy, Julia FRIFEILD, Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs, [redacted] Office of the Legal Advisor, [redacted] Office of the Legal Advisor overseeing STATE\u2019s [redacted], [redacted] [redacted] and [redacted]. \\nThe document goes on to explain that the \u201c7th Floor Group\u201d (which is also called \u201cThe Shadow Government\u201d) pushed to have all of Clinton\u2019s e-mails released \u201call at once in January 2016\u201d even though \u201cwith larger FOIA requests, such as with the CLINTON-related FOIA request\u201d that would normally be done on a scheduled \u201crolling release\u201d happening \u201cevery few weeks or month.\u201d It also says that while IPS (the Office of Information Programs and Services) \u201cofficials did not have control of the release process of the 296 e-mails related to the House Select Committee on Benghazi\u2019s request, they did have control for the release process for the approximately 30,000 e-mails or 52,455 pages related to the CLINTON FOIA request, and it was decided to be a rolling release.\" \\nThe \u201c7th Floor Group/The Shadow Government\u201d is mentioned in previous documents as well. On page 54, it says, \u201c[redacted] stated those involved at IPS felt the 7th floor, or leading STATE officials, had their own ideas on how to formally review the 296 emails.\u201d It is obvious that \u201cThe Shadow Government\u201d on the 7th floor wanted to protect Clinton in both the review process and the release process. \\nPerhaps this explains why \u2014 despite a mountain of evidence that Clinton knowingly violated a plethora of federal laws regarding her use of a private e-mail server and account to send and receive classified information \u2014 the FBI declined to recommend indictment. After all, Clinton is the clear \u201cShadow Government\u201d candidate in this presidential race.  '"}, "time": 1742563092.0371277}
