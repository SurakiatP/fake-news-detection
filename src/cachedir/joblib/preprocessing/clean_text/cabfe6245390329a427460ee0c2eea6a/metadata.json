This is equivalent to 780 crimes committed by migrants every day, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over 2015. The data includes only those crimes in which a suspect has been caught. \\n\u201cThousands of migrants who entered the country as \u2018asylum seekers\u2019 or \u2018refugees\u2019 have gone missing. They are, presumably, economic migrants who entered Germany on false pretences. \\n\u201cMany are thought to be engaging in robbery and criminal violence.\u201d \\nAccording to Freddi Lohse of the German Police Union in Hamburg, many migrant offenders view the leniency of the German justice system as a green light to continue delinquent behaviour, says the report.
