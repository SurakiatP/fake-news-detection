When you break the trust you are given and in the process break the law, there are consequences, no matter who you are or what your profession. I want to thank the Michigan State Police and FBI\u2019s Detroit Area Public Corruption Task Force for their hard work on this investigation.\u201d \\nAccording to investigators, Swanson was a state-certified salvage vehicle inspector since 2011. As an inspector, Swanson was responsible for overseeing salvage vehicle inspections, during which a $100 fee is collected. For over a year, Swanson allegedly pocketed these fees and forged the forms that authorized the salvage. \\nSwanson is accused of applying this scam to 1,701 vehicles, bringing in a total of $170,100. \\nAfter he was charged, Swanson was forced to resign from the police department. \\nPolice spokesperson Andrea Bitely told reporters that \u201cOur office , in conjunction with the Michigan State Police and Secretary of State, are working together to make sure that all vehicles involved in this case have, actually have a proper salvage vehicle inspection, and we\u2019ll contact the registered owners of the vehicles to make sure we arrange for now inspection in a timely manner.\u201d \\nPrior to his crimes as an inspector, Swanson was praised in the media as a \u201chero\u201d in 2013 for being one of the first responders to a large pile-up. \\nSwanson and his lawyers are attempting to use his past media fame as a defense in this most recent case, despite the fact that it is entirely irrelevant. \\nDefense attorney John Freeman said that Swanson is still a \u201chero.\u201d \\n\u201cThese charges don\u2019t detract from the fact that Trooper Swanson was a real-life hero and was a good trooper. It\u2019s easy for people to lose sight of that fact,\u201d Freeman said. \\nSwanson was released on $10,000 bond and is currently awaiting trial. \\nBelow is a video from 2013 in which Swanson was hailed as a hero.
