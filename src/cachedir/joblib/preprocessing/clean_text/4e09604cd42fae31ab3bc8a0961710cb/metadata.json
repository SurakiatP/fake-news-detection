[Not everyone agrees with the decision, including Democrats, Vladimir Putin and the communist Chinese government.  \u201cThe Russian Government has said it supports the Paris Agreement on climate change ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s expected announcement that he will withdraw the US from the landmark accord,\u201d the UK Independent reported on Thursday. The Kremlin said the deal, which seeks to limit global warming to as close to a 1. 5 degrees Celsius increase as possible, would be less effective without the participation of major countries, Reuters reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters that \u201cPresident (Vladimir) Putin signed this convention in Paris. Russia attaches great significance to it. \u201cAt the same time, it goes without saying that the effectiveness of this convention is likely to be reduced without its key participants,\u201d Peskov said. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said there was an \u201cinternational responsibility\u201d for countries to take action over climate change during a trip to Europe for talks with European Union officials. The communist leader also claimed there is a \u201cglobal consensus\u201d on the need to fight climate change. \u201cIn an unprecedented step, the European Union and China are to release a joint statement in a sign of the increasing closeness between Brussels and Beijing  \u2014   and the widening divide between Brussels and Washington under Mr Trump,\u201d the Independent reported. Meanwhile, Democrats have launched a war of words since the moment Trump made the announcement, including former President Barack Obama. \u201cEven in the absence of American leadership even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future I\u2019m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we\u2019ve got,\u201d Obama said in a statement. In a statement, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( ) said the decision \u201ccould go down as one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our nation\u2019s history. \u201d Rep. Bill Foster ( ) told the Mic website it will be devastating for the country and the environment. \u201cIf you\u2019re a scientist and you stand up and say something you know is not true, it is a   move,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI lost count of the number of objectively false statements the president made   \u2026     the   will have a field day. \u201d \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement is a catastrophic mistake that puts the   interests of his friends in the fossil fuel industry ahead of the safety and security of American people and the future of our planet,\u201d Sen Al Franken ( ) said.'"}, "time": 1742562101.7635505}
