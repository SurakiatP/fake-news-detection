Mr. Erdogan\u2019s warning turned out to be awkwardly timed, coming hours before a deadly attack outside the British Parliament. In a Twitter post written in English, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, quickly condemned the assault in London, noting that Turkey had \u201csuffered similar attacks many times. \u201d Mr. Erdogan\u2019s comments were a response to restrictions placed on his surrogates in European countries including Germany and the Netherlands, where they have been barred from holding political rallies in support of a referendum in which Turks will decide whether to expand their president\u2019s powers. \u201cIf you go on behaving like that, tomorrow nowhere in the world, none of the Europeans, Westerners will be able to walk in the streets in peace, safely,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said at a meeting in Ankara, the capital. The outburst was his latest attempt to rally nationalist voters before the tightly contested referendum. In Germany alone, 1. 4 million residents have the right to vote in the referendum on April 16. Amid fears he might lose, Mr. Erdogan and his allies have issued   diatribes against European countries, a tactic that they hope will play well among swing voters. In previous days, he has frequently accused German and Dutch politicians of Nazism. He has also suggested that he might scrap the accord that restricted the passage of migrants through Turkey and send a new wave of migrants to Europe. Western news organizations have been quick to report on these provocations, which are then read and condemned by European leaders  \u2014   creating a feedback loop that in turn gives Mr. Erdogan more excuses to criticize Europe and to begin the cycle afresh. The tactic appeals to some Turkish voters, including many of those who attended a rally on Wednesday in Kastamonu in northern Turkey, where Mr. Erdogan headed immediately after speaking in Ankara. \u201cHe defends our country against the whole world,\u201d said Hasan Birgun, 59, a retired salesman in Kastamonu. \u201cUntil Erdogan, our leaders were just standing meekly in the outside world. \u201d Hopes that the dispute would ease were raised on Tuesday, after Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party canceled plans to send more lawmakers to campaign in Germany. But the president\u2019s inflammatory comments on Wednesday suggested those hopes were premature. In Turkey on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the Norwegian ambassador after Norway granted refuge to four Turkish asylum seekers accused by Turkey of being involved in the  coup attempt in July, Reuters reported.'"}, "time": 1742628559.2610207}
