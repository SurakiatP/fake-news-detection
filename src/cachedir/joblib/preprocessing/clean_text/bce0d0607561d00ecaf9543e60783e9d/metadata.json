Unfortunately, the media is pushing a false narrative. \\nFact is theses are not protests. According to the law, the events taking place are riots. Under Federal Law, a riot is a public disturbance involving an act of violence by one or more persons assembled in a group of at least three people. Inciting a riot applies to a person who organizes, encourages, or participates in a riot. It can apply to one who urges or instigates others to riot. According to 18 USCS 2102 \u201d to incite a riot\u201d, or \u201d to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot\u201d, includes, but is not limited to, urging or instigating other persons to riot. \\nGeorge Soros, the radical left leaning billionaire who supported Hillary Clinton and donates to radical groups such as Black Lives Matter and MoveOn.org, is behind the riots and needs to be held accountable. The majority of people showing up to these riots are paid to do so by Soros-funded-groups. \\nBelow is a video produced by RT.com It connects Soros to the riots.
