With a clear view down the length of the train, commuters walk from car to car searching for a less crowded spot to stand. Others gather in the   passageway between cars, an area once separated by doors. Nearly five years after Canada\u2019s largest city introduced the spacious new cars, subway riders here  \u2014   usually quick to find fault with the transit system  \u2014   have given the trains a ringing endorsement. \u201cYou can fit more people, especially during rush hour,\u201d said Louis Molnar, 43, an accountant who stood in the shifting connector between two cars on a recent evening. \u201cIn the past, sometimes you\u2019d have to wait for the next car, and this makes it so much better. \u201d Now, officials in New York City are embracing the car design to create more breathing room for subway riders as the system struggles with booming ridership and increasingly overstuffed trains. The new subway trains, which could start to appear in New York by 2020 or earlier, do not have doors between cars, creating up to 10 percent more space. These   open gangway trains are common in cities like London and Shanghai, but subway systems in the United States have not adopted them. Not far from New York on the other side of Lake Ontario, the trains have become popular in Toronto, a city that is also grappling with a growing population and an overtaxed transit system. Some riders even enjoy standing in the bouncing connector, comparing it to surfing or skateboarding. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of fun,\u201d Chantal Wall, 33, a stylist, said as she balanced on a connector in heels. \u201cIt makes it a little bit more interesting. I feel like I get a little bit of a workout. \u201d In New York, officials plan to order up to 750 of the cars to run on the subway\u2019s lettered lines. The higher capacity trains are part of a broader push to ease crowding. The authority is also updating the signal system so that trains can run closer together and expanding the system with projects like the Second Avenue subway line, which is scheduled to open on the Upper East Side in December. The   transportation authority had planned to buy only 10 open gangway cars, but moved to expand the order after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, asked it to look at ideas from around the world, said Veronique Hakim, president of New York City Transit, the authority division that runs city subways and buses. The agency plans to work with the builder to make sure the cars arrive \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you look at other large systems  \u2014   Paris, London, Toronto  \u2014   you can really see and appreciate that these   car designs provide additional space,\u201d Ms. Hakim said in an interview. To make it easier for riders to enter the cars, the new trains will have   doorways, up from 50 inches, though Toronto\u2019s doorways are 64 inches. (To be fair, Toronto\u2019s system is far from perfect it still accepts tiny tokens while New York retired the coins more than a decade ago.) Toronto\u2019s reputation as a livable city with good transit has helped it grow to more than 2. 8 million people, on par with the population of Chicago. Toronto\u2019s transit system  \u2014   the third largest in North America  \u2014   has about 1. 7 million riders each weekday on its network of subways, streetcars and buses, but those figures are dwarfed by New York City\u2019s nearly 6 million daily subway riders. Toronto\u2019s transit system is facing major crowding challenges and uncertainty over funding. The city has three main subway lines, and its busiest, the   line, is regularly packed at rush hour, mirroring conditions on New York\u2019s busiest lines. Steve Munro, a longtime transit advocate in Toronto, said that the new cars had helped with crowding, but that the city should have built new subway lines to handle the rising demand decades ago. \u201cBy the time you realize you need the new trains, you already have a crowding problem, and there is a backlog of demand that will immediately fill the new capacity,\u201d Mr. Munro, 67, said at a cafe near the busy   station. Mr. Munro, Toronto\u2019s version of Gene Russianoff, New York City\u2019s prominent voice for subway riders, cautioned that even with the new cars, trains would still be very crowded. Some riders in New York have raised concerns that regular subway annoyances  \u2014   from \u201cshowtime\u201d dancers to misbehaving riders  \u2014   might now become the whole train\u2019s problem, instead of being contained to one car. Andy Byford, the chief executive of the Toronto Transit Commission and an enthusiastic evangelist for improving the system, dismissed those fears, saying riders could easily escape unpleasant situations in the new cars. \u201cYou\u2019re not then trapped in a single carriage,\u201d Mr. Byford said from his office atop the Davisville station north of downtown Toronto. \u201cYou can get up and move. \u201d If a rider urinates or vomits, someone could simply walk away, rather than waiting for a station and darting from one car to another. Shameen Miller, 33, said that was how she responded when she came across a man emitting a foul odor. \u201cThink about it  \u2014   their smell is not going to drift all the way down,\u201d Ms. Miller said. One downside is that if a train has a technical problem, workers must remove the entire   train from service, Mr. Byford said, instead of separating a pair of cars and replacing them. But over all, he said, the benefits have outweighed the drawbacks. As major cities around the world have switched to open gangway subway cars, American cities have been reluctant to try them. Yonah Freemark, a transit blogger in Boston who created a map of all the cities where the trains are used, called the delay a case of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism in a really bad way. \u201d New York\u2019s decision to buy the cars was a major step, especially because the authority has been slow to adapt to technology, like countdown clocks or a new fare payment system. \u201cIt exhibits that the agency is moving into the 21st century when it comes to trains,\u201d Mr. Freemark said. American transit officials have had reservations about whether the design could work on the nation\u2019s aging subways and whether ridership levels warrant the expense of switching to the new cars, said Randy Clarke, a safety and operations expert at the American Public Transportation Association. In Boston, subway officials considered the idea for new cars on two lines but decided against it. Officials in New York have worked with engineering consultants on the plans and are confident the design is feasible, even though the subway is an older system, Ms. Hakim said. In Toronto, the best sign of the cars\u2019 popularity is that riders whose lines do not have the trains are pleading for them. Sygmund Gaskin, 45, said he wished the older trains on his   Line could be replaced with the new cars. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it takes so long to get them for this line,\u201d he said. \u201cHow come we don\u2019t have them here as well?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628447.0510855}
