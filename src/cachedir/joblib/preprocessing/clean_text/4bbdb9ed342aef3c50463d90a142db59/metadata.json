Schrode had joined others from the camp in solidarity as they prayed on the shoreline. \\nA confrontation erupted after law enforcement dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site. \\n\u201cI was shot in point blank range,\u201d said Schrode, who says she is shaken but physically will recover. \u201cAnother water protector was also shot at twice at point blank range, but the rubber bullet hit the water, and not him.\u201d \\nIn a press release, the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department said it used \u201cless-than-lethal ammunition to control the situation\u201d when a man threw bottles at officers on the police line and when another charged the police line. \u201cOfficers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers,\u201d the release said. \\nEven as law enforcement warned protesters to leave the area and return to their camp, demonstrators could be heard yelling back at police. \\n\u201cThere was absolutely no provocation of any kind,\u201d said film director Josh Fox, who was also on scene. \u201cThe police pepper sprayed people sitting in the water.\u201d \\nLaw enforcement vehicles and personnel have been stationed on a hill overlooking the shoreline in question for a number of days, and the hill is recognized as a burial ground and sacred site by the Standing Rock Sioux. \\nOn Monday, people who identified themselves as water protectors waded across the creek to the hill to request that law enforcement move off the sacred area. \\nAccording to the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department public information officer, the police remained there \u201cto prevent criminal trespass on private property.\u201d \\nWednesday, the Department said The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave Morton County orders to remove a wooden pedestrian bridge that had been constructed across the river and arrest any individuals who cross the river for criminal trespass. \\n\u201cI was facing the line of officers from across the river and all of a sudden, I felt as if someone swung a mallet with all their might against my lower back. It obliterated me,\u201d said Schrode. \u201cI turned around and I had no idea what just happened. And there was an officer pointing his gun in my direction from a boat.\u201d \\nMorton County called the situation a \u201cstandoff\u201d and, in a press release, stated that \u201cprotesters involved in this activity are violating numerous federal and state laws.\u201d \\nE\u2019sha Hoferer , who is a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe and who says he is in Standing Rock to protect the water for his children and grandchildren, told NBC News before Wednesday\u2019s encounter with law enforcement that the construction of the pipeline is \u201cdesecrating a lot of sacred sites\u201d and that \u201ca lot of the traditional ecological knowledge that we have \u2013 that Standing Rock has \u2013 shows that we have ceremonial sites up there, sacred sites, burial sites,\u201d referring to the hill at the center of the standoff. \\nThe last big clash between police and demonstrators took place on Thursday, October 27, when 141 protesters were arrested .'"}, "time": 1742561675.997139}
