[The interviewer from the Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds told the Pope that \u201cthe whole world is tense\u201d over the election of President Trump, calling him a xenophobe filled with \u201chatred for foreigners. \u201d  The Pope said that the new President deserved to be judged by his actions, not by \u201cprophecies\u201d of what he may or may not do. \u201cI think that we must wait and see,\u201d Francis said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to get ahead of myself nor judge people prematurely. We will see how he acts, what he does, and then I will have an opinion. \u201d The Pope said it is \u201cmost unwise\u201d to be afraid of something that might happen. \u201cIt would be like prophets predicting calamities or windfalls that don\u2019t take place. We will see. We will see what he does and then evaluate,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer to wait and see. \u201d The interviewer, Antonio Ca\u00f1o, pressed the Pope further, asking whether he wasn\u2019t \u201cworried about the things you have heard up until now. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m waiting. God waited a long time for me, with all my sins  \u2026    \u201d Francis replied. The Pope\u2019s words Friday echoed a recent interview with the Archbishop of Vienna, Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, who also advised against rushing to negative judgments of Trump, comparing him to Ronald Reagan, who turned out to be a great president. Asked for his impressions about the election of Donald Trump, Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn noted that when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 \u201cmany shook their heads\u201d and it turned out they were wrong. \u201cGood God, an actor from California!\u201d they said. \u201cAnd Reagan was certainly one of the best presidents the U. S. ever had. So you should not be too quick to judge,\u201d he advised. In Friday\u2019s lengthy interview with El Pa\u00eds, Pope Francis was also asked whether he was concerned about the spread of a populism throughout the world that capitalizes on \u201cpeople\u2019s fears,\u201d preaching \u201ca message of hate. \u201d Francis distinguished between a good, grassroots populism, where it is the people who are \u201cthe protagonists,\u201d and a cult of personality where a charismatic figure like Hitler rises to power and is welcomed as a savior figure. The latter can be very dangerous, he said. The risk, Francis said, is that in times of crisis we lack judgment and people can begin to think, \u201cLet\u2019s look for a savior who gives us back our identity and let\u2019s defend ourselves with walls,   whatever, from other people that may rob us of our identity. \u201d \u201cAnd that is a very serious thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I always try to say: talk among yourselves, talk to one another. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
