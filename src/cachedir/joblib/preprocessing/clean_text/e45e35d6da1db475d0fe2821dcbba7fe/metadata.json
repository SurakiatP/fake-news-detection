In the video Cindy Almodovar who spoke with Huma Abedin about email issues that were going on admits that the FBI didn\u2019t interview her. In December, 2010, U.S. Department of State IT Systems Administrator Cindy Almodovar reported that she met with Huma Abedin for thirty minutes regarding emails at the then unknown, but now notorious, @ clintonemail.com site. Here\u2019s is the text from that email exchange: \u201cFrom: Almodovar, Cindy T Sent: Friday, December 17, 2010 11:17 AM To: SES-IRM_Tech Cc: SES-IRM_FO-Mgt Subject: Meeting with Huma I met with Huma for about 30 minutes to go over mail issues. She gave me some examples listed below, but also, things are inconsistent. But issue #1 is of an e-mail which was sent to her twice this morning, did get received on <REDACTED> but was not delivered. See details below. I have a contact for the @clintonemail site, his name is Bryan Pagliano and he actually now works for State, but he apparently set all of this up. Huma sent several tests from her clintonemail account to Lona and myself \u2013 they were received. But there are many messages and responses not received. She sent a message this morning from her state.gov account to cheftwan@mail.house.gov.On 12/14, hdr22@clintonemail.com sent a message to huma@clintonemail.com and Valmoroli@state.gov at 10:03 pm . The subject line was blank. Huma received at Clinton address, but Lona did not receive on her state.gov account.\u201d As a result of subsequent investigations regarding Secretary Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. State Department reported the following: From the unclassified May 2016 State Department report ESP-16-03: Two staff in S/ES-IRM reported to OIG that, in late 2010, they each discussed their concerns about Secretary Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email account in separate meetings with the then-Director of S/ES-IRM. In one meeting, one staff member raised concerns that information sent and received on Secretary Clinton\u2019s account could contain Federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy Federal recordkeeping requirements. According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary\u2019s personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further. As previously noted, OIG found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal system. According to the other S/ES-IRM staff member who raised concerns about the server, the Director stated that the mission of S/ES-IRM is to support the Secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary\u2019s personal email system again. The director referred in the OIG report is John Bentel. In 2010, he was the State Department employee who managed IT security issues for the top echelon of the department. He told FBI investigators those conversations back in 2010 never occurred. In March of 2016, Bentel refused to answer questions from Senate investigators and asserted his Fifth Amendment right 87 times during a deposition for a civil lawsuit related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.\u201d Here\u2019s a transcript of the exchange between Project Veritas\u2019s journalist and Cindy Almodovar. PV Journalist: I\u2019m working on a story. I\u2019m interested. I want to know the truth and I want to know if you\u2019re one of the people who came, who went to John Bentel and said they were concerned about Hillary\u2019s private server. Almodovar: I don\u2019t know anything about that. PV Journalist: You weren\u2019t involved in that at all? Almodovar: You\u2019ve got to stop this because this is like harassment. PV Journalist: This will be the last time you see me. I just want to know the truth. I\u2019m interested. I want to know if the FBI has talked to you. Almodovar: No they haven\u2019t. PV Journalist: They haven\u2019t at all\u2026 \u2026PV Journalist: I\u2019m sure reporters and people have been coming to your door. Almodovar: No. No one has come to the door. You\u2019re the first one. \u201cEven though her name stands out in the emails released by the FBI, no one from the FBI ever spoke to Aldomovar,\u201d said Project Veritas Action founder James O\u2019Keefe. \u201cNo one interviewed her or made any attempt to get to the bottom of what information she might have about this case that is so important to national security. It made us wonder\u2026who else the FBI neglected to talk with.\u201d The post appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742561991.6867871}
