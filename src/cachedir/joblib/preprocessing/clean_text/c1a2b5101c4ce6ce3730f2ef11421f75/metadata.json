You can tie your shoes with the door open: Your whole life, you\u2019ve been used to closing and maybe even locking the door when you tie your shoes. No longer! You can do it with the door open, and don\u2019t need to put on a fan to cover the shameful sound. \\n2. The newspaper doesn\u2019t heat itself up: If you want some hot newspaper, you\u2019re going to have to pop it in the microwave yourself. There\u2019s no other way around it. \\n3. If you used to live with Manny Pacquiao, there are probably fewer punching bags around now: Get ready to have a bunch more floor space if you no longer live with boxer Manny Pacquiao, never mind not having to worry about a punching bag knocking you over after a solid strike from the world-class champ.
