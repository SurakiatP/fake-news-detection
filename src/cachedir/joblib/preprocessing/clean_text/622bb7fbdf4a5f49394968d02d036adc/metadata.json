The festivals, the groupthink, the   sounds  \u2014   these were the hallmarks of a scene designed for ecstatic release, but also one that was easily parodied. And so rather than make serious music that others might dismiss, they embodied parody themselves. They made songs about selfies and Kanye West (in so much as they were about anything) and saw their stars rise. They seemed to understand, in a particularly disquieting way, how easy it was to game the system, turning growing American interest in and tolerance of   dance music into a platform for   ambition. That made the Chainsmokers both disorientingly effective and easily loathed. So maybe it\u2019s humility, or maybe it\u2019s strategy, but pointedly, over the last couple of years, the duo of Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall have been engaged in a very public process of dismantling mainstream dance music from within. By this point, they are essentially a pop duo  \u2014   Mr. Taggart sings and writes, and both men produce. Instead of   club music though, they\u2019ve come to specialize in a style that approximates a skinned and deboned version of those sounds, maintaining a handful of its key gestures and flourishes while administering a benzodiazepine to the tempo and volume. In 2015 and 2016, three Chainsmokers songs reached the Top 10 of the Billboard singles chart, as have two songs that appear on their new album, \u201cMemories  \u2026    Do Not Open,\u201d \u201cParis\u201d and the Coldplay collaboration \u201cSomething Just Like This. \u201d Each hit has been more denuded than the one that preceded it. This is the logical endpoint of the American   explosion of the last decade, which was almost certainly never going to end in a nightclub. It was a long con in retraining pop ears to accept some of that world\u2019s sonic ideas. By that measurement, \u201cMemories  \u2026    Do Not Open\u201d  \u2014   the first   Chainsmokers album  \u2014   is a savvy success that cannily toys with expectations. Most songs hover between 95 and 105 beats per minute, something more than a slog but less than a gallop. Often, when a song arrives at the drop  \u2014   the place where an explosion usually lands  \u2014   it instead veers into something like a sun shower, or a crowd applauding in the distance, rarely the usual gut punch. But these strategic victories don\u2019t overshadow the Chainsmokers\u2019 myriad weaknesses. In the ecosystem in which the Chainsmokers have thrived  \u2014     dance music and the pop that derives from its distillation  \u2014   the album is a meaningless concept, and the album format underscores both this duo\u2019s weaknesses and strengths. Mr. Taggart is a capable but unexciting singer. And he has shockingly few lyrical ideas, less of a concern for performers more adept with melody. Most songs here moan about brittle young relationships over the musical equivalent of bringing an amiable golden retriever along for an unhurried jog. (The songs written with the   Emily Warren, like \u201cDon\u2019t Say\u201d and the excellent \u201cMy Type,\u201d are among the best here, with an emotional texture the others grasp for futilely.) Two    songs, the impressive \u201cHonest\u201d and \u201cWake Up Alone,\u201d parse the weight that fame exacts on emotional relationships  \u2014   they\u2019re among the most credible on the album. While the Chainsmokers often appear to have decided what sort of music they\u2019re not making, their affirmative choices are lacking. \u201cThe One\u201d ends up somewhere near chillwave, \u201cBreak Up Every Night\u201d is toothless   and \u201cLast Day Alive,\u201d a collaboration with the   duo Florida Georgia Line, is 100 percent pure pablum, a collection of dim anthemic sayings in search of a stadium, a twinkle with no diamond. All of this makes for songs in search of remixes, skeletons notable as much for what\u2019s missing as what\u2019s there. That\u2019s a curious position for an act moving from the world of   festivals, where the scene is the star more than the performer, to the world of pop, where personality counts, a shift that may well be the Chainsmokers\u2019 undoing, even if their music remains effective. That\u2019s because onstage, on the duo\u2019s handful of televised performances, they\u2019re almost brutally awkward. On \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d  \u2014   where they performed \u201cParis\u201d and \u201cBreak Up Every Night\u201d last weekend  \u2014   they were listless and limp. Of course they were. Mr. Taggart is not an aggressively trained pop star (and for what it\u2019s worth, not a disruptive punk either). He was uncomfortable in the same way a young indie rock or folk singer might be, unsure of how to use his body as effectively as his voice. The Chainsmokers might have gamed their way into pop, but pop is hard work  \u2014   inside jokes melt under the klieg lights.'"}, "time": 1742562192.9419787}
