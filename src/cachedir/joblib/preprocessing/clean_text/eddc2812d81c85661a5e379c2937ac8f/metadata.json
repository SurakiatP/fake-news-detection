It has exposed raging conflicts within the FBI and, more broadly, the national security apparatus as a whole. \\nComey\u2019s cryptic letter acknowledged that the FBI has not actually reviewed a new batch of emails that \u201cappear to be pertinent\u201d to its previous investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state. The agency, he wrote, \u201ccannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.\u201d This astonishing admission makes all the more extraordinary Comey\u2019s decision to make the discovery of the new emails a public issue only eleven days before the election. \\nIn a rapid-fire series of developments this weekend, Justice Department officials revealed that they had opposed Comey\u2019s decision to send the letter, arguing that it violated a longstanding principle that no Justice Department or FBI action that might impact on a candidate should be announced within 60 days of an election. \\nThe Clinton campaign and congressional Democrats lashed out at Comey for the timing of the letter. At a campaign rally in Daytona Beach, Florida, Clinton said Comey\u2019s action is \u201cnot just strange, it\u2019s unprecedented.\u201d She also tweeted that \u201cFBI Director Comey bowed to partisan pressure,\u201d suggesting that the letter was an effort to appease congressional Republican leaders opposed to Comey\u2019s determination last July that there was no basis for criminal charges against Clinton over her use of a private email server. \\nDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid sent a letter to Comey suggesting that he had violated the law forbidding government employees to use their official positions to influence the result of an election. \u201cI am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThrough your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.\u201d \\nHe added that Comey had \u201cdemonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another,\u201d because he had made public the renewed FBI interest in Clinton\u2019s emails, but was silent on what Reid called \u201cexplosive information\u201d supposedly connecting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Russian government officials. \\nHere Reid was resorting to the Russia-baiting that has been the Clinton campaign\u2019s main response to the publication by WikiLeaks of tens of thousands of emails and other documents sent or received by campaign chairman John Podesta, including devastating information on Bill Clinton\u2019s use of the Clinton Foundation to obtain lucrative speaking engagements with corporations and business associations. Campaign spokesmen have refused to discuss the contents of the emails, claiming that they were hacked by Russian government agents and then handed over to WikiLeaks to damage Clinton and help Trump. \\nNBC News reported Sunday that the FBI has now obtained a search warrant to go through all 650,000 emails found on the laptop of former congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton\u2019s closest aide, Huma Abedin. Weiner is under FBI investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl. \\nThe Wall Street Journal gave details, in a story posted on its web site Sunday afternoon, of the explosive internal crisis within the FBI that led to Comey\u2019s letter to Congress. By this account, there has been a fierce battle within the FBI and between the FBI and the Justice Department not only over the Clinton email investigation, but over separate investigations involving four FBI field offices (New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles and Little Rock, Arkansas) into the operations of the Clinton Foundation. \\nMore than eight months ago, FBI agents presented plans for a more aggressive investigation of the foundation to career prosecutors in the Justice Department, only to have the proposal blocked on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence. The FBI offices nonetheless continued their investigations, which were intensified after the Clinton email investigation was wound up in July. \\nThe Journal report suggests that either a substantial faction within the FBI was convinced that top FBI officials were covering up criminal activities on the part of Hillary and Bill Clinton, or the FBI dissidents were politically motivated to use agency resources to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, or both. \\nWhen top officials in the FBI and Justice Department opposed these efforts, open rebellion followed, expressed in leaks to the Wall Street Journal centrally targeting FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for state senate in Virginia last year. According to some press reports, Comey sent his letter to Congress last week because he was convinced the information would become public anyway through further leaks by FBI subordinates. \\nThe open warfare engulfing Washington on the eve of a presidential election reveals that the entire political system and the state apparatus itself are riven by tensions and conflicts so deep and bitter that they cannot be contained within the traditional framework of bourgeois elections. Fueling these tensions is the convergence of crises on the economic, geopolitical, internal political and social fronts. \\nThe US and world economy remain mired in stagnation more than eight years after the 2008 Wall Street crash, and there are growing fears that central bank policies designed to buttress the banks and drive up stock prices are leading to a new financial disaster. The economic crisis is fueling social anger and alienation from the entire political system, as reflected in different ways in the mass support for the anti-Wall Street campaign of the self-styled \u201csocialist\u201d Bernie Sanders and the \u201cAmerica first\u201d pseudo-populist campaign of Donald Trump.
