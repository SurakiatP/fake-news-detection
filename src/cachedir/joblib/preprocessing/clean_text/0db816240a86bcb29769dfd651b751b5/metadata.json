{"duration": 0.10904550552368164, "input_args": {"text": "'Rosie Gray, an   reporter who now works at The Atlantic magazine, told Breitbart News exclusively that she disagrees with the decision her old editor, BuzzFeed\u2019s Ben Smith, made to run a fake news dossier against President Donald Trump accusing the    of having untoward relations with Russia. [\u201cI would not have made that decision to run that,\u201d Gray told Breitbart News on Tuesday when asked if she would have run either the BuzzFeed story containing the dossier or the previous CNN piece on live television and online which aimed to lend credibility to the dossier without actually publishing it. Gray does still consider Smith a mentor and a friend, however.  Gray\u2019s decision to speak out publicly against her former employer, BuzzFeed, is noteworthy considering she was one of the top newsroom employees there. She also, in her new capacity as a reporter for The Atlantic, delivered one of the earliest and strongest hammer blows against Smith\u2019s and CNN\u2019s decision to publish the dossier, discrediting BuzzFeed and CNN. \u201cIt Is Fake News Meant to Malign Mr. Trump\u201d read the headline on Gray\u2019s expos\u00e9 debunking BuzzFeed\u2019s report on a supposed intelligence document alleging a number of salacious things about Trump and his team. \u201cMichael Cohen, an attorney for the   has denied allegations contained in a dossier published by BuzzFeed News,\u201d Gray\u2019s   in The Atlantic reads, further blowing up the   BuzzFeed scoop. The document published by her old employer, Gray wrote, \u201calleges that Michael Cohen, special counsel to Trump, was central to \u2018the ongoing secret liaison relationship between the New York tycoon\u2019s campaign and the Russian leadership,\u2019 and that he met secretly with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016. \u201d But unlike BuzzFeed, which didn\u2019t actually check to verify the allegations before it published the document, Gray actually checked to see if that specific allegation was true or not. And Gray found the first of many holes in BuzzFeed\u2019s report, ripping her old employer\u2019s fake news report to shreds by having made just a few phone calls to see if the allegations in the document were accurate. Gray wrote: Reached by telephone on Tuesday night, Cohen denied the dossier\u2019s allegations. The story is \u2018totally fake, totally inaccurate,\u2019 Cohen said. \u2018I\u2019m telling you emphatically that I\u2019ve not been to Prague, I\u2019ve never been to Czech [Republic] I\u2019ve not been to Russia,\u2019 Cohen said. \u2018The story is completely inaccurate, it is fake news meant to malign Mr. Trump.\u2019 Cohen said that during the time the report places him in Prague, he was actually with his son visiting USC and meeting with the baseball coach. Gray, unlike BuzzFeed, actually called the source of the allegation to ask him if it was true before she printed it. And she called the University of Southern California, too, to verify that claim  \u2014   and they confirmed it. Gray wrote at her new publication, The Atlantic: A USC baseball source confirmed Tuesday night that Cohen and his son had visited USC on August 29th. Cohen said that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August, and that the rest of the month he was in New York. He said that his only trip to an EU country over the summer had been a vacation to Italy in July. In one instance, the dossier places the alleged Prague travel in \u2018  2016.\u2019 Cohen said he was in New York for the entire month of September. Gray is part of a group of discredited   staffers who fled the publication in a recent mass exodus. Andrew Kaczynski, who was a lead researcher for BuzzFeed, went to work for CNN. And McKay Coppins, the largely discredited BuzzFeed scribe who inaccurately profiled Trump before he ran for president in a hit piece claiming Trump would never run for president, joined Gray in traveling to The Atlantic. Among other mistakes that BuzzFeed allowed its reporters to make, Coppins also inaccurately reported the fake news that Breitbart News was funded by Donald Trump during the campaign. BuzzFeed\u2019s Smith, Gray\u2019s old editor, has not immediately responded to a request for comment on Gray\u2019s decision to admonish her old employer\u2019s irresponsible editorial  . CNN in many ways was worse than BuzzFeed in what they did on this front: While CNN did not actually publish the document, anchor Jake Tapper and reporters Jim Sciutto, Evan Perez, and Carl Bernstein lent enormous credibility to the source of the document without verifying any of the now discredited allegations. The episode resulted in a very public blowup for both CNN and BuzzFeed, as at Trump\u2019s first press conference as   earlier in January he blasted CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta \u2014  who broke journalistic norms in his attempts to interrupt the    \u2014  as working for a \u201cFake News\u201d outlet. Trump also blasted BuzzFeed as a \u201cfailing pile of garbage\u201d during that press conference. UPDATE 3:10 p. m. ET: Gray confirms publicly she would not have made the same decision as Smith or CNN, but then tries to rationalize it in an unhinged  . ok so, before this becomes a thing, here\u2019s what actually happened here   https:  .   \u2014   Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) January 24, 2017,    I called Boyle for a story I\u2019m working on.
