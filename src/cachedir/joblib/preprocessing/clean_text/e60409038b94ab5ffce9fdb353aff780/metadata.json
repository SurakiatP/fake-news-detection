[Harvard professor and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund Kenneth Rogoff told Bloomberg that following WEF 2016 he \u201cstarted to grow concerned\u201d   Donald J. Trump would become the next president of the U. S. because his fellow frequent attendees of the gathering in the Swiss town of Davos were certain that Mr. Trump would not win.  \u201cA joke I\u2019ve told 1, 000 people in the months since leaving Davos is that the conventional wisdom of Davos is always wrong,\u201d said the former IMF chief who is scheduled to attend Davos again this year along with some 3, 000 other members of the political, business, media, and academic elite. \u201cNo matter how improbable, the event most likely to happen is the opposite of whatever the Davos consensus is,\u201d he added. Davos also failed to predict the rise of populism in Europe, Italy\u2019s rejection of constitutional change that led to the resignation of Prime Minister Mattheo Renzi, or the UK voting to leave the European Union (EU) which Forbes described as the \u201cpopulist revolt against Davos Man\u201d. \u201cDavos Man\u201d was coined by political scientist Samuel P. Huntington who described \u201cthese transnationals\u201d as \u201c[having] little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite\u2019s global operations\u201d. One of the eight Oxford University academics set to attend the meeting, Ngaire Woods, dean of the Blavatnik School of Government, said, \u201cThere has to be some humility. For 30 years the elite have said, \u2018We\u2019re managing globalization, and we\u2019re making it work for everyone\u2019. \u201d \u201cThey cannot just keep repeating that,\u201d added the frequent Davos visitor. However, WEF founder Klaus Shwab has alleged that globalisation was an \u201ceasy scapegoat\u201d for world angst, and argued that populism wasn\u2019t the answer, saying, \u201cWe cannot just have populist solutions\u201d. With populism high on the agenda at Davos, one of the sessions will include a panel of psychologists offering thoughts on \u201ccultivating appropriate emotions in a time of nationalist populism\u201d. Managing Director of the IMF Christine Lagarde, who was found guilty in December of criminal negligence in an arbitration case over the misappropriation of funds, expressed that she wanted to rehabilitate the appearance of globalism. She said she wanted a \u201cmove toward globalization that has a different face, and which is not excluding people along the way\u201d. Lagarde will be headlining a session at Davos entitled: \u201cSqueezed and Angry: How to Fix the Middle Class Crisis\u201d along with hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio.  Days before the EU referendum vote, the French lawyer belittled Brexit voters by implying they were   called for a \u201cunited Europe\u201d and launched a report claiming a \u2018Leave\u2019 vote would lead to half a million job losses. Also anticipated to attend the exclusive conclave is billionaire open borders activist and founder of the Open Society Foundations George Soros, who admitted involvement in Europe\u2019s Migrant Crisis and called national borders \u201can obstacle\u201d and has financial ties to the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. Other notable attendees include a dozen members of the European Commission including Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, who responded,\u201cI do not take my mandate from the European people\u201d when asked a question by a poverty campaigner regarding the unpopular Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal between America and the EU, which was opposed by millions of Europeans.'"}, "time": 1742561952.6691327}
