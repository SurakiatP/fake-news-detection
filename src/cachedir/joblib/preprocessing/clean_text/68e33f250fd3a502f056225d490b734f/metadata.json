Bill is currently campaigning for his wife, plus Hillary recently unveiled that Bill with be in charge of \u201c revitalizing the economy \u201d if she were to take office. \\nIt has been uncovered that Clinton, known for his trouble-making libido, has even stronger ties to Epstein than previously reported. As noted by The Free Beacon , \u201cClinton was aboard the infamous Lolita Express owned by a billionaire pedophile at least 26 times,\u201d not the initially reported 11 times. \\nFox News reports : \\nClinton\u2019s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \u201cTatiana.\u201d The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls\u2026Official flight logs filed with the Federal Aviation Administration show Clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as 10 U.S. Secret Service agents. However, on a five-leg Asia trip between May 22 and May 25, 2002, not a single Secret Service agent is listed. \\nThe Republican presumptive nominee apparently got in on the action, too. Trump\u2019s ties to Epstein \u2014 a man Trump once called a \u201cterrific guy\u201d \u2014 and Sex Slave Island have been chronicled by The Daily Wire here . \\nPer The Political Insider, Trump is accused of threatening and raping a 13-year-old girl on the private island . Epstein is also named in the suit for sexual misconduct. The lawsuit accusations have been vehemently denied by the Trump camp, alleging that the filing is a \u201choax\u201d and that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that the plaintiff in question \u201cactually exists.\u201d \\nSex Slave Island, sometimes referred to as \u201cOrgy Island,\u201d (both lovely names), is one deranged place, allegedly rife with solicited sex, often from minors \u201c groomed \u201d by Epstein. \\n\u201cTerrific guy\u201d Epstein, of course, was convicted for soliciting sex from a minor in 2008; the billionaire served 13 months in prison. \\nElection 2016: Where both candidates have ties to a convicted pedophile, the Lolita Express and Sex Slave Island.'"}, "time": 1742563145.114004}
