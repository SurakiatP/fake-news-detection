At the same time, climate change is taking on a prominence it has never had before in a U. S. presidential election. \u2022 On the music charts. Drake reached No. 1 for a 12th week. His \u201cViews\u201d has matched two other albums for   runs at the top: Alanis Morissette\u2019s \u201cJagged Little Pill\u201d (1995) and Santana\u2019s \u201cSupernatural\u201d (1999).

The most famous example might be the woman who drove 900 miles across several countries over two days, even though her destination was just 90 miles away in her own country, Belgium. The most tragic cases, when a device guides drivers down abandoned roads or uses outdated data, for example, can end in death, whether in a rural area like Death Valley National Park, or not far from Chicago. (Learn about GPS mishaps here and here.) A precursor to GPS, the Jones Live Map, had similar troubles keeping up with changes 100 years ago, though, it offered over 500 routes across the country. GPS, which stands for global positioning system, got its start in the U. S. military, which was trying to track Sputnik, the first artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Scientists learned they could figure out its orbit by measuring the changes in the frequency of its radio signal. Today, satellites controlled from Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado transmit a constant signal emitted by their atomic clocks. Billions of devices, including your smartphone, carry a receiver that locks onto the signals to calculate your location. The first   GPS receiver became available in the 1980s, and now the technology is ubiquitous  \u2014   mostly for the better. Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a. m.
