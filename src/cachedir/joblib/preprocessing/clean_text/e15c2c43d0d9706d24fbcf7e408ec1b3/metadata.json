In my opinion, Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out Andrew\u2019s mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump; he has shaped the company into Trump\u2019s personal Pravda, to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter.\u201d \\nThat decision paid off for Bannon \u2013 in August, he became Trump\u2019s campaign \u201cCEO.\u201d At that point, I wrote this piece describing who Bannon was , and this one for The Washington Post describing his probable impact on the campaign . \\nWith Bannon\u2019s accession to a top White House role, it\u2019s time to answer some brief questions about the man and what he\u2019s likely to do. \\nIs Bannon Anti-Semitic And Racist? I have no evidence that Bannon\u2019s a racist or that he\u2019s an anti-Semite; the Huffington Post\u2019s blaring headline \u201cWHITE NATIONALIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE\u201d is overstated, at the very least. With that said, as I wrote at The Washington Post in August, Bannon has openly embraced the racist and anti-Semitic alt-right \u2013 he called his Breitbart \u201c the platform of the alt-right .\u201d Milo Yiannopoulos, the star writer at the site, is an alt-right popularizer , even as he continuously declares with a wink that he\u2019s not a member. The left\u2019s opposition to Trump, and their attempts to declare all Trump support the alt-right have obfuscated what the movement is. The movement isn\u2019t all Trump supporters. It\u2019s not conservatives unsatisfied with Paul Ryan, nor is it people angry at the media. Bannon knows that. He\u2019s a smart man, not an ignorant one. The alt-right, in a nutshell, believes that Western culture is inseparable from European ethnicity . I have no evidence Bannon believes that personally. But he\u2019s happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into European far-right nationalist populism. That means that the alt-right will cheer Bannon along as he marbles Trump\u2019s speeches with talk of \u201cglobalism\u201d \u2013 and that Bannon won\u2019t be pushing Trump to dump the racists and anti-Semites who support Trump anytime soon. After all, they love Bannon \u2013 actual white supremacists like Peter Brimelow called his August appointment \u201cgreat news,\u201d and Richard Spencer explained, \u201cBreitbart has elective affinities with the Alt Right, and the Alt Right has clearly influenced Breitbart. In this way, Breitbart has acted as a \u2018gateway\u2019 to Alt Right ideas and writers. I don\u2019t think it has done this deliberately; again, it\u2019s a matter of elective affinities.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean Bannon will push racist or anti-Semitic policy, or that he\u2019ll be anti-Israel himself \u2013 unless it serves his interests. \\nWhat Does Bannon\u2019s Accession Mean? Bannon has goals. One of those goals is maximization of personal power, which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful right-wing personalities (Bachmann, Morris, Palin), kissing their asses, and then moving on up the chain. With Breitbart and Trump, he picked two winners in a row \u2013 and that means he\u2019s now at the pinnacle of American power. \\nSo, what will he do with that power? He\u2019ll target enemies. Bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics, which is why I\u2019ve been joking for months that should Trump win, I\u2019d be expecting my IRS audit any moment. That wasn\u2019t completely a joke. He likes to destroy people. \\nBut more importantly, Bannon\u2019s interested in turning the Republican Party into a far-right European party. Because Republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that, it could happen. Here\u2019s what I wrote in March about the Trump movement : \\nTrump is a European-style response to the European-style leftism of Barack Obama. He\u2019s a soft European-style populist, from his interventionist economics to his closed-borders foreign policy. As I wrote in December, \u201cCompare Trump\u2019s platform with that of Marine Le Pen, whose French National Front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment. She calls for harsher penalties for criminals, significant restrictions on Muslim immigration to France, protectionism on trade, a restoration of the Franc as the national currency rather than the Euro, and big government in terms of health care. This sounds a lot like Trump.\u201d But the European right is not the American right. The American right believes in Constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government. The European right doesn\u2019t believe any of these things. Should Trump win, we could watch American conservatism lose the only party it has ever had. \\nThat\u2019s the plan. Yesterday, The Daily Beast reported that Bannon reached out to Le Pen for \u201cglobal ultra-right coalition.\u201d Over the weekend Le Pen met with Nigel Farage of the UK Independent Party. And Trump met with Farage shortly after being elected. Bannon has always wanted to burn down the GOP. That\u2019s still his goal. He wants it replaced with an American National Front party in fact if not in name. \\nWhich War Will Bannon Lead? Bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore \u2013 always at war. Always. So the only question left is this: what will Bannon\u2019s actual role be? It\u2019s difficult to tell, since Trump announced the Bannon hire at the same time he announced that former RNC chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff. What will their relationship be like? Ed Morrissey of HotAir thinks that Bannon will lead the anti-media fight, and Reince will coordinate with Congress. That would be the best possible scenario. \\nOthers have speculated that Bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base, which would be angry at Trump hopping into bed with the most establishment-y fellow in Washington. That, too, would be fine. \\nIt\u2019s hard to tell from the outside what\u2019s happening, but here\u2019s a third theory: Reince is the bagman for Trump, and Bannon\u2019s whispering in Trump\u2019s ear. That would fit the fact pattern here, given Reince\u2019s outsized praise for Bannon this morning: \u201cwise and smart\u2026very, very smart, very temperate.\u201d Bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree. He\u2019s a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees; he's actually malevolent. Priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because he\u2019s the one catering to Bannon\u2019s agenda. \\nIf Bannon\u2019s leading and Reince is following, that bodes ill for the Republican agenda. Bannon opposes the Republican Party, hates Paul Ryan \u2013 minutes after the joint Bannon/Priebus announcement, Breitbart News approvingly tweeted about a Congressional rebellion against Speaker Ryan \u2013 and wants to watch it all \u201cburn.\u201d Bannon loves the firefight. The only question is which direction he\u2019ll turn his fire. Tags\""}, "time": 1742563310.0291889}
