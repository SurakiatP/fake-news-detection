C.  \u2014   Brittany Graham had been confident that Hurricane Matthew would bring no more than a few inches of rain to this inland city. But by Sunday afternoon, her grandfather\u2019s small farm was underwater. A grazing field was submerged. No one knew where most of the cows were. Floodwaters, perhaps three or four feet deep in some places, had covered the wheels of two trucks and flowed into a supply barn. Relatives squealed as they watched fish from the family\u2019s pond swim across the road. \u201cMy grandpa\u2019s still in shock,\u201d Ms. Graham, 29, said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t prepare anything because from what we heard, we were just going to get a little bit of rain. Basically, all his stuff is ruined. \u201d \u201cThis,\u201d she added, \u201cis completely devastating. \u201d Here in Lumberton, and in much of eastern North Carolina on Sunday, residents were taking stock after Hurricane Matthew pounded the state over the weekend with a furor that seemed improbable days earlier. North Carolina officials reported eight deaths, a figure that accounted for nearly half of the hurricane\u2019s death toll in the United States, and Gov. Pat McCrory warned that the casualty count was \u201cexpected to increase. \u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t assume that there aren\u2019t people clinging for life right now in houses that are underwater that we have yet to reach, especially in lower populated areas,\u201d Mr. McCrory said. \u201cThat\u2019s what my major concern is. \u201d Still, dozens of boat and aircrews rescued more than 1, 000 people, more than 700 of them in Cumberland County, which includes Fayetteville and Fort Bragg. The state also had countless informal evacuations and rescues, strung together by residents and visitors who sometimes acted with little warning. Melissa Fineman, the general manager of a Comfort Suites hotel in coastal Brunswick County, had retreated to her room on Saturday night when she heard creaking in the building, which was filled with evacuees and linemen from a local utility company. \u201cThe pressure and the gusts just started cracking the walls,\u201d she said. \u201cWith each gust of wind, it just got wider and wider. \u201d Ms. Fineman decided to empty the hotel. After a    effort that she said took just minutes, the property\u2019s 123 guests, and their 45 animals, had escaped through a back stairwell, ultimately fleeing to a nearby high school and escaping the wrath of a storm that once seemed poised to spare this state. But the havoc in North Carolina was an unwelcome reminder of both the inherently deceiving nature of the   Hurricane Wind Scale  \u2014   the storm was barely classified as a Category 1 hurricane when its bands hit North Carolina  \u2014   and the    behavior of a tropical cyclone. As recently as Thursday, when forecasters were predicting that Hurricane Matthew would leave North Carolina mostly unscathed, Mr. McCrory said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the storm. Then the hurricane shifted, losing power but maintaining moisture and taking aggressive aim at much of North Carolina\u2019s   coastline and the state\u2019s inland counties. Some areas recorded more than a foot of rain, and by Sunday morning, Mr. McCrory and his constituents were lamenting an increasingly dire landscape of devastation. \u201cWhen you go from a Category 4 hurricane to a Category 1, the danger of harm is still there,\u201d Mr. McCrory said. \u201cWhat those categories don\u2019t include is how water can kill. \u201d In North Carolina on Sunday, more than 3, 000 people were in shelters, and some 770, 000 homes and businesses were without electricity. Parts of Interstate 40 and Interstate 95 were closed, and the authorities warned that more trouble was to come as rain poured into rivers and raced toward the coast. Some local governments ordered evacuations and curfews. The National Weather Service, which said that many of its river gauges in eastern North Carolina showed major flooding, predicted that the Lumber River would remain above record levels until at least Friday. In Rocky Mount, the Tar River was expected to surpass its record height by nearly three feet. And near Goldsboro, the Neuse River was forecast to reach 29. 6 feet on Monday, nearly a foot above its record. \u201cThat\u2019s always the trouble in eastern North Carolina  \u2014   because the saturation tables are so low, the water doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go,\u201d said the Rev. William J. Barber II, the president of the North Carolina chapter of the N. A. A. C. P. and a pastor of a church in Goldsboro. \u201cWe\u2019re downstream. If a storm drops a lot of rain in the Raleigh area, it comes down like a wall this way. \u201d In Florida, Georgia and South Carolina on Sunday, residents turned much of their attention to recovery as people removed trees, cleared roadways and increasingly found their electricity restored. People in coastal communities who had heeded orders to evacuate returned to their homes to survey the damage, often trading text messages and pictures with one another to share what they had found. Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, citing requests from local officials, maintained evacuation orders in two counties, but she allowed people to return to Charleston, the state\u2019s   city, and its surrounding area. \u201cThe weather looks good next week, which is a great sign as we want to try and do the recovery, so that\u2019s the one blessing that we do have,\u201d Ms. Haley said. And here in North Carolina, residents were girding for a hard recovery in places like Hope Mills, where Marie Pelkey, 42, stared through the trees at her younger sister\u2019s waterlogged home. \u201cShe\u2019s probably lost everything,\u201d Ms. Pelkey said, her face flushing as tears rolled past her thick black sunglasses. A neighbor, Cathy Swain, walked over to wrap Ms. Pelkey in her arms. She, too, knew the extent of the devastation and how it rivaled the destruction of previous storms. \u201cMajor roads are washed out,\u201d she said. \u201cBridges are gone. I\u2019ve been here 53 years. I was here through Fran, Floyd  \u2014   never seen anything like this. It\u2019s going to take a long time. \u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the Walmart closed. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561653.4475572}
