Positive Trump polls are coming all the time, so it\u2019s all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to Hillary. Obama\u2019s latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and he\u2019s spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing it. From Judicial Watch : Months after the Obama administration spent $19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November, it\u2019s dedicating an additional $10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches. The money is distributed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration, to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction, English, U.S. history and civics courses. Officially, they\u2019re known as \u201ccitizenship integration grants.\u201d[\u2026] Judicial Watch went on to say\u2026 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year, offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens. Clearly, the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats. \u201cWe intend to award about $1 million to first-time recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016,\u201d the agency\u2019s grant announcement states. \u201cIf you represent one of these organizations, or know of an interested organization, we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying. Additionally, another $9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services.\u201d Some might consider this a cash giveaway.[\u2026] Practically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants. For example the Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing \u201cnew workforce programs\u201d for the \u201cnew Americans\u201d and the Department of Education is promoting \u201cfunding opportunities\u201d to assure that the immigrants \u201care provided the tools they need to succeed.\u201d The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on \u201cimmigrant-focused career-pathways programs.\u201d The Department of Justice (DOJ) and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is launching a two-year pilot to assure that non English speakers have \u201cmeaningful access to housing programs\u201d subsidized by American taxpayers. Obama likes to pretend that he\u2019s doing this for the greater good of America, but the truth is it\u2019s just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the ground.
