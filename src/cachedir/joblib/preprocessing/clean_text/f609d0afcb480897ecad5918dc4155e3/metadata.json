Shop manager Emma Bradford cried several times at the televised stories of people struggling against adversity, but feels new benefits cuts for poor families are a great thing. Bradford said: \u201cSeeing all those people coping with difficult circumstances was very moving, I was in bits over the little lad who raised \u00a310,000 selling homemade biscuits on the internet to buy a new wheelchair for his mum. \u201cBut that in no way affects my view that there are too many scrounging benefits bastards. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get a benefits person jumping into a river to save someone because they\u2019d be at home eating frozen pizza and smoking. \u201cI think Pride of Britain proves that the worse people\u2019s problems are, the more they try to overcome them, so we could motivate the unemployed by giving them serious illnesses. \u201cIf they battled their illness and managed to get a job as well you could give them an award. That would make a really good TV programme.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742561846.0492122}
