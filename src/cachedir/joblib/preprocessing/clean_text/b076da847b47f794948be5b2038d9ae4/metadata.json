She looked as if she was having fun. He, not so much. The exchange came as the first presidential debate was building toward its conclusion Monday night. What was it about? I have no idea. Per instructions from my editor, I was watching with the sound off. Alone. No checking my email, no talking to my wife, no social media. It was, for me, a silent debate. The idea was simple: to test the theory that what presidential candidates  \u2014   in this instance, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump  \u2014   say during debates is less important than what they look like while they\u2019re saying it. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this theory, dating from the nation\u2019s first televised presidential debate: Richard M. Nixon versus John F. Kennedy in 1960, which set the handsome and composed Kennedy on a course to victory over the conspicuously underweight and sweaty Nixon. Ever since, presidential debates have routinely been defined more powerfully by images than by words. You can even find academic research on the subject: nonverbal expression, the experts call it. A psychology professor has had some success predicting the outcome of elections based purely on which candidate blinks less frequently during debates, the idea being that   blinking is a sign of stress and anxiety, generally not desirable qualities in a commander in chief. (For what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s also possible to blink too little, which can make a candidate seem reptilian.) Hence our experiment: Can you learn more about who won the debate by watching it on mute? It began, of course, with the ritual handshake at center stage before the candidates retreated to their lecterns. After the shake, Mr. Trump placed his hand gently on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s back. There were different ways to interpret the gesture. Was he being patronizing  \u2014   trying to assert his   dominance from the    \u2014   or just looking to demonstrate that he felt comfortable, relaxed, unthreatened by the professional politician? Whether involuntary or intentional, the signal was unmistakable: I\u2019m the strong one here. And either way, they were soon off, discussing   \u2026     the most pressing issues facing our nation, I can only assume. It will be no surprise to learn that Mr. Trump is loud even with the sound off. He delivered 90 minutes of increasingly exaggerated pantomime, announcing the presence of someone who is restless, impassioned, emphatic and at times belligerent. (\u201cNo idea what he\u2019s talking about, but he\u2019s def going at it hard,\u201d read my notes from the   mark.) Do not call this man  . He has an extensive repertoire of almost manic hand and arm gestures: the   karate chop, the accordion, his patented cobra. The performance is so physical  \u2014   with the pincer fingers, the hyperactive eyebrows, the \u201cC\u2019mon already!\u201d shrugs  \u2014   that there\u2019s not much work left for the words to do. There is no ambiguity about the message: Actions speak louder than words. Also: Bring it on. Even when it was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s turn to speak, Mr. Trump couldn\u2019t stand still. He fidgeted. He smirked. He grimaced. He squinted. He adjusted his microphone. He grabbed hold of the sides of his lectern. He rocked back and forth on his heels. He pursed his lips. He threw his opponent a disbelieving sidelong glance, and then an eye roll. He shook his head. He appeared to interrupt her, repeatedly. (On one occasion, I could make out a word  \u2014   a word!  \u2014   \u201cwrong. \u201d) He took a sip of water. And then another, licking his lips as he set the glass back down. He\u2019s more expressive while listening than most people are while speaking. In the face of this continual turbulence, Mrs. Clinton had a studied serenity. She has made no secret of her assiduous debate preparation, and I couldn\u2019t help feeling that she had prepared for the very exercise I was engaged in. She seemed determined to make sure that her body language and facial expressions didn\u2019t communicate frustration or irritation  \u2014   see Al Gore in 2000  \u2014   no matter what her opponent said. And she seemed equally determined to appear to be having fun. Whether she was or not  \u2014   could this possibly be fun?  \u2014   she succeeded in looking the part. She appeared unbothered, even amused, by Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent assaults. At times, she looked a little smug  \u2014   surely a lot smug to Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. There was plenty of smiling  \u2014   another product of the debate prep, no doubt  \u2014   and laughing, too, presumably at Mr. Trump\u2019s expense. The suggestion seemed to be that we were all in on the joke. She had her hand gestures, as well, including her version of the trademark \u201cClinton thumb,\u201d but she did little in the way of violence to the air around her. Visually, anyway, there was a discernible arc to the event, with Mr. Trump growing more agitated as the night wore on, and Mrs. Clinton becoming almost giddy with what felt increasingly like genuine pleasure. Which brings us back to the shimmy. Absent words, it felt like the most telling moment of the evening, a memorable, instinctive reaction to what I imagined must have been a Trump howler. In that instant, it was clear that the debate had produced a winner, at least to those of us who hadn\u2019t actually heard a word of what the candidates had said: Mrs. Clinton. He had vibrated with anxiety she had radiated cool confidence. He had seemed to be crawling out of his own skin she had looked uncharacteristically comfortable in hers. Minutes later, it was all over. Once again, the candidates came together. Once again, Mr. Trump put his hand on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s back, this time with a little pat, as if to confer his approval on a job well done. Mr. Trump\u2019s family came out to greet him, but they opted not to linger, exiting   while Mrs. Clinton and her husband celebrated the moment with their fans in the audience.'"}, "time": 1742562992.7932746}
