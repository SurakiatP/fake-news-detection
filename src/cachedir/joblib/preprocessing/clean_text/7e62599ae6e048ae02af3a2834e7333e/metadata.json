It did so after the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia declined to block the name change, ending for now a  debate that has divided George Mason\u2019s suburban Washington campus since the university announced in March the decision to rename the school and the large gift from conservative donors prompting it. Though it was expected, the decision came as a disappointment to the students and faculty, as well as a dozen or so Democrats in the Virginia legislature, who opposed the name change out of concern that it would tie the university to a conservative justice whose views, they thought, ran counter to its educational mission. George Mason administrators ultimately found that argument unpersuasive. And on Tuesday, in a bureaucratic twist, the council\u2019s members unanimously decided that in fact they did not have the authority to override the university\u2019s board of visitors, which had already accepted the donations and the terms that came with them. David K. Rehr, the law school\u2019s senior associate dean, lauded the outcome and said that though the school was better for having had the debate over the name change, it was time to move on. The combined $30 million gift  \u2014   given by the Charles Koch Foundation and an anonymous donor  \u2014   will fund new scholarships, a dozen new faculty positions, and two new centers in line with the school\u2019s flagship Law and Economics Center, which emphasizes the economic effect of the law, beginning next fall. The renaming is intended to take effect July 1. \u201cWe think that looking back five, 10, 15 years from now, people will see it as an important turning point for the law school and for the students here,\u201d Mr. Rehr said. Opponents of the renaming agree, though they argue that the changes will not be for the better, signaling to potential students of diverse backgrounds that George Mason is not welcoming to them. It is less clear what effect Tuesday\u2019s decision will have on the increased scrutiny the gifts have prompted among faculty members over the influence conservative donors  \u2014   chiefly Mr. Koch, the billionaire industrialist who has given tens of millions of dollars to pet projects there  \u2014   have on Virginia\u2019s largest public university. \u201cThis issue really brought to the surface a whole set of issues that have been alive on our campus for a long time that we have not really been responding to,\u201d said Craig Willse, a cultural studies professor who helped lead the opposition to the change. \u201cSpecifically, the issue of Koch money has really been put on the table in a way that it hasn\u2019t been before. \u201d In a series of letters to the university faculty in recent weeks, \u00c1ngel Cabrera, George Mason\u2019s president, pledged to address concerns and reiterated that he would never cede academic independence to a private donor. A faculty senate task force studying the influence of private donors is expected to release a report in the fall. As for the name change, those who had tried to block it said they were resigned on Tuesday, if dissatisfied with the state\u2019s inability to regulate such changes. \u201cI think short of getting the board of visitors to change their minds, which they have demonstrated they don\u2019t want to do, I think this is it,\u201d said Marcus Simon, a Democratic state delegate who had led a petition drive against the change. \u201cThe name\u2019s the name for the foreseeable future. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628472.4113033}
