Leo shelved the original Caribbean plan in favor of New Orleans, selected a hotel that had something for everyone, and found an inexpensive flight. But though at    Leo is at least as tall as your average travel agent, he is actually my    nephew. \u201cWe were stalled out, \u201d Katrina told me. \u201cAnd he said \u2018I\u2019ll take it from here.\u2019 I was a little bit skeptical. \u201d But aside from a tweak in the flight, everyone  \u2014   Katrina my brother, Jeremy my younger nephew, Grady my mom (a. k. a. Grammy) and my Aunt Nancy  \u2014   agreed to his choices, including a   stay in Le Pavillon. When I heard about this, I may have tilted my head like a dog when it hears a weird noise. When did kids suddenly acquire travel planning skills? I\u2019m pretty sure the first time I picked a hotel was when I met up with my girlfriend in England at age 23. Actually, she probably picked it. But times have changed. \u201cThe general concept of your children influencing your vacation,\u201d said Karen Cicero, travel editor at Parents magazine, \u201cwhether helping pick the destination or planning part of the trip, is a trend. \u201d I\u2019m skeptical when people use the   but she pointed to a 2015 survey of 540 parents by YouGov for HomeAway, the vacation rental site, showing that millennial parents are more likely to let their children ages 6 to 18 pick a destination themselves, than children of older parents. It makes sense. Trip planning, these days, takes place mostly online, and children know a thing or two about the internet. Considering that Leo shops for sneakers and jackets online, looking for deals to convince his parents, the jump to hotels doesn\u2019t seem drastic. Ms. Cicero said that social media also played a role. \u201cMy daughter is 13, and if you scroll through her Instagram feed, you\u2019ll see pics of her friends\u2019 vacations  \u2014   it gets kids excited and gives them ideas. If you think back to even 10 years ago, school ended and you didn\u2019t find out where your friends had gone until you went back. \u201d Involving children has benefits beyond   experience. \u201cWhat this highlights is the importance of getting \u201d said Rainer Jenss, the president and founder of the Family Travel Association. \u201cA lot of parents don\u2019t consider getting their kids involved in the planning process, dictate it to them and sometimes make assumptions about what would make the kids happy. \u201d That can lead to   choices like Disney World or   cruises. But \u201cif kids are involved in the decision,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have ownership. \u201d I reached Leo on his cellphone as his parents drove him and Grady to a Massachusetts summer camp. \u201cEveryone wanted to go to the Dominican Republic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s pretty expensive, so I tried to find a place that was warm and not too expensive. \u201d That ended up being New Orleans. He checked a weather app to make sure it wouldn\u2019t be too cold. The hotel was trickier. He knew his parents wanted to be \u201cclose to the center but not so close that it would be so loud I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Leo said. He had a priority as well: a pool. A web search led to Groupon. com, where he spotted a photo of Le Pavillon\u2019s rooftop pool. He went to lepavillon. com, and noted that the hotel was \u201ca short stroll to the French Quarter. \u201d And he didn\u2019t forget the older generation. \u201cIt had kind of a French name so it sounded like Grammy might like it. \u201d Curious if he was on target, I emailed my father, Peter Kugel, who confirmed that his wife might be swayed by a French moniker. He signed the email \u201cPierre,\u201d and cc\u2019ed her. Some experts caution that while involving children in planning is good, there are no precise guidelines. Parents should set limits appropriate to their own children. (Allow me to interpret: Not every    is as awesome as my nephew.) \u201cYounger kids and some teens don\u2019t necessarily have all the tools to plan a trip in a way that would make everyone happy,\u201d said Mark Bertin, a developmental pediatrician in Pleasantville, N. Y. \u201cBut as long as you\u2019re aware of what your child\u2019s really capable of, you could even involve a younger child a little bit. \u201d Maintaining veto power is a   but so is setting boundaries to avoid having to use it  \u2014   perhaps by preselecting options for children to choose among. \u201cIf they make a choice that is not practical, it puts you at loggerheads,\u201d said Dr. Karl Neumann, the pediatrician behind kidstraveldoc. com. But for children who can handle it, open planning encourages them to consider others\u2019 preferences. That was a challenge when Maddie Bates, 15, of Sterling, Va. was put in charge (along with her brother, Tyler, 20) of the yearly family vacation  \u2014   also for a   group of six. Greece was their pick, influenced in part by Maddie\u2019s friends who had visited. In a phone call, Maddie described the different preferences within the group. She is into food, while her brother \u201clikes    kind of stuff. \u201d Then there\u2019s her dad, who is the reading, relaxing type. Her aunt, Philippa Hughes, is into \u201carts stuff. \u201d Maddie\u2019s research method led her away from review sites and toward bloggers who had written narratives on trips to Greece. \u201cIt was a lot better than reading reviews on TripAdvisor,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you knew what they were doing and how they were feeling when they went to each place. \u201d She also got tips from friends. To encourage family feedback, the two siblings posted suggested activities on Travefy, which allows collaborative trip planning. But up to a few days before departure, their father and aunt had barely meddled. Not so Maddie\u2019s    Vietnamese grandmother. \u201cI feel she\u2019s kind of scared I\u2019m planning,\u201d said Maddie. \u201cBecause she\u2019s been warning me about things she doesn\u2019t like. She\u2019s really just not a fan of walking. \u201d Being in charge was nice for Maddie, who is low on the hierarchy of her traditional Vietnamese family. \u201cUsually, I don\u2019t plan anything, I just go with the flow,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be the one planning rather than going on a trip and being like \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019 \u201d She sounded more confident in her choices at 15 than Leo did at 12. \u201cThere was lots of pressure because if the hotel ended up being junky, it would be my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I got a sense of pride that I found the stuff. \u201d And as it turns out, everyone was happy. Not so on the trek to camp. The family was to spend the night together before the children were dropped off. I asked Leo if he helped plan that trip. \u201cI wish I did,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\u2019re staying at the Super 8. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562455.3230612}
