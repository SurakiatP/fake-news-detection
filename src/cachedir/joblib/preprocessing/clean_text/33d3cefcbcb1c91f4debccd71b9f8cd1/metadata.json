The verdict was announced around 2:55 p. m. on Friday. [St. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez testified during the trial that    Philando Castile had his hand on a gun.  A Facebook video live streamed by Diamond Reynolds, his girlfriend who was in the car, went viral. She narrated as Castile sat dying. Officer Yanez fatally shot Castile on July 6 after a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, a suburb in St. Paul, Minnesota. At the time, there was a question as to whether Castile was a suspect in a recent convenience store robbery. Officer Yanez faced charges of manslaughter and reckless discharge of a weapon. The Minnesota jury has been deliberating this week. Shortly after the shooting, Officer Yanez\u2019 lawyer said, \u201cI can tell you that the stop of the vehicle for an equipment violation was not the only reason for the stop. \u201d A handgun was recovered at the scene. During the Facebook live stream, Reynolds said, \u201cpolice just shot my boyfriend for no apparent reason. \u201d Castile had a concealed handgun license. During Yanez\u2019 trial, a police force expert testified that the officer was justified in his use of force. Expert Joe Dutton told jurors \u201cWhen Yanez saw the   grip of Castile\u2019s hand, he had to react to the actions of Mr. Castile,\u201d reported the CBS affiliate in Minnesota. He added, \u201cThis truly was a   decision, there wasn\u2019t time to do anything else. \u201d A firefighter testified that he heard Castile\u2019s gun drop to the ground from his pocket when he put him on a stretcher. Officer Yanez took the stand in his defense. He testified that he stopped Castile\u2019s car after Castile drove past him and gave him a \u201cdeer in the headlights\u201d look that made him suspicious. \u201cIt\u2019s a trigger,\u201d he testified. The officer was already on alert after the convenience store robbery and Castile looked like one of the robbery suspects. He radioed his partner that he was going to pull the car over because \u201c[t]he two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery,\u201d Minnesota\u2019s Star Tribune reported. He also had legal grounds to pull Castile over because he was driving with a broken brake light. Yanez walked up to the car, and he could smell burnt or burning marijuana, he testified. The officer told the jury he saw Castile\u2019s hand on the gun and Castile did not follow his instructions not to reach for the gun. He told the jury, \u201cI told him, \u2018Don\u2019t pull it out,\u201d but when he saw Castile pull out the top of the gun, \u201cThat\u2019s when I engaged Mr. Castile and shot him. \u201d The officer testified when he saw Castile\u2019s gun, \u201cmy family popped into my head. My wife. My baby girl. \u201d \u201cI did not want to shoot Mr. Castile at all. \u201d \u201cThose were not my intentions. \u201d After the shooting, Castile\u2019s mother, Valerie Castile, reportedly told CNN, \u201cI think he was just black in the wrong place. \u201d Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton further fanned the flame of racial tension when he asked at a press conference after the shooting  \u2014   \u201cWould this have happened if the driver and passenger were white?\u201d  He answered his question saying  \u2014   \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have,\u201d reported Fox 9 News in  . Paul. As can be heard in the video, the officer told the girlfriend, \u201cI told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hand off of it. \u201d This occurs at the   mark in the video.
