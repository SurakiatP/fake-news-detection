Trump came to a state battling a drug epidemic and suggested without any evidence on Saturday that his opponent had been on drugs during their second debate. \u201cI think we should take a drug test prior to the debate,\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd of thousands gathered in the parking lot of a Toyota dealership on a chilly afternoon. He continued: \u201cWe should take a drug test prior because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with her. But at the beginning of her last debate  \u2014   she was all pumped up at the beginning, and at the end it was like, \u2018Oh, take me down.\u2019 She could barely reach her car. \u201d When asked for comment, the Clinton campaign directed reporters to a statement by Robby Mook, the campaign manager, that was put out earlier in the day in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations of a \u201crigged\u201d election. \u201cCampaigns should be hard fought and elections hard won, but what is fundamental about the American electoral system is that it is free, fair and open to the people,\u201d Mr. Mook wrote. \u201cParticipation in the system  \u2014   and particularly voting  \u2014   should be encouraged, not dismissed or undermined because a candidate is afraid he\u2019s going to lose. \u201d Mrs. Clinton stepped away from the campaign trail over the weekend to prepare for the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday, and Mr. Trump has spent the week criticizing his opponent\u2019s public schedule as too heavy on \u201cdebate prep\u201d while he campaigns around the country. In recent days, Mr. Trump has made increasingly outlandish allegations as he seeks to fend off reports of lewd comments and accusations of sexual assault. Among other things, he has alleged a global media conspiracy and told his followers that the electoral process is being rigged against him. He has also personally insulted and degraded the women who have accused him. Mr. Trump, who said he was willing to take a drug test before the next debate, directed a large portion of his remarks to the drug epidemic. He praised the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act as an \u201cimportant step in the right direction,\u201d and he called for more drug courts and mandated treatment. \u201cI would dramatically expand access to treatment sites and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump said the government should reduce the amount of   Schedule II opioids like oxycodone that can be made and sold in the United States. He also criticized the Food and Drug Administration, saying that it was too slow to approve addiction recovery medicines and that \u201cwe need to move it along. \u201d He promised that his border wall and policies would help stem the flow of drugs into the country. Mr. Trump praised his running mate, Mike Pence, for increasing \u201cmandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders\u201d as governor of Indiana, although the candidate himself did not personally endorse the idea. Mr. Trump has often focused on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health during the presidential race. He claims she lacks the \u201cstamina\u201d to campaign, or to be president. His campaign released an ad this week focusing heavily on her health.'"}, "time": 1742562193.1383233}
