Dianne Feinstein ( ) called the NRA an \u201cextreme organization\u201d that stands in the way of getting \u201c  assault weapons off our streets. \u201d[Feinstein\u2019s NRA comment came after she voiced her expectations that the Supreme Court will have final say on air and water pollution and just before she addressed employers who \u201c[discriminate] against workers. \u201d  CSPAN 2 aired Feinstein\u2019s comments: \u201cIt is the Supreme Court that will have final word   \u2026     [on] whether the NRA and other extreme organizations will be able to block common sense gun regulations, including those that keep   assault weapons off our streets. \u201d Many things are at play in Feinstein\u2019s statement, including the ongoing Democrat animosity toward the fact that the Supreme Court rulings in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010) pose a great hindrance to the future of gun control in this country. Moreover, Feinstein\u2019s statement betrays her continued support of an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban, such as the one that Democrats enacted during the Clinton administration or the one Feinstein herself unsuccessfully pushed after the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. On September 14, 2014, Breitbart News reported a New York Times (NYT) column that described \u201cassault weapons\u201d as a \u201cmyth\u201d Democrats created in the 1990s. NYT pointed out, \u201cIn the early 1990s   \u2026     Democrats created and then banned a category of guns they called \u2018assault weapons.\u2019 America was then suffering from a spike in gun crime and it seemed like a problem threatening everyone. Gun murders each year had been climbing: 11, 000, then 13, 000, then 17, 000. \u201d It then showed that the creation of the \u201cassault weapons\u201d moniker was a political contrivance: \u201cThis   category of guns \u2014  a selection of rifles, shotguns, and handguns with \u2018military features\u2019 \u2014  only figured in about 2 percent of gun crime before the ban. Handguns were used in more than 80 percent of gun murders each year. \u201d In the 1990s, the Democrats created a category of guns called \u201cassault weapons,\u201d demonized them, then set out to ban them as a way to keep Americans safe. However, the whole time, such weapons were only used in \u201cabout 2 percent of gun crime. \u201d The truth then and now is that concealable weapons are far preferable for criminals than bulky,    weapons of any type. Moreover, FBI crime stats for 2015 show nearly three times more people were stabbed or hacked to death than were killed with rifles and shotguns combined, and those are rifles and shotguns of any type. If we were to specify a certain type of rifle \u2014  an   or   \u2014  the ratio of stabbing deaths versus shooting deaths would be even more lopsided.
