Russia has continued to test the United States on the military front, with fighter jets flying close to an American warship in the Black Sea this month and a Russian naval vessel steaming conspicuously in the Atlantic off the coast of Delaware. \u201cThey think he is unstable, that he can be manipulated, that he is authoritarian and a person without a team,\u201d Alexei A. Venediktov, the editor in chief of Echo of Moscow, a liberal radio station, said of President Trump. The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, has long sought to crack the liberal Western order, both as a competitor and as a champion of an alternative, illiberal model. To that end, he did what he could to buttress the electoral chances of Mr. Trump, who seemed like a kindred spirit with his harsh denunciations of NATO and the European Union, his endorsement of the British withdrawal from the European Union and his repeated shrugs over Russia\u2019s destabilizing Ukraine. In this context, Mr. Trump\u2019s election was an unexpected bonus, but the original giddiness has worn off, and Moscow has returned to its    formula of creating turmoil and exploiting the resulting opportunities. \u201cThey are all telling each other that this is great, he created this turbulence inside, as we wanted, and now he is focused on his domestic problems and we have more freedom to maneuver,\u201d Mr. Venediktov said. \u201cLet them deal with their own problems. There, not in Ukraine. There, not in the Middle East. There, not in NATO. This is the state of mind right now. \u201d Sergei A. Markov, a leading analyst friendly to the Kremlin, made much the same point. \u201cRight now the Kremlin is looking for ways that Russia can use the chaos in Washington to pursue its own interests,\u201d said Mr. Markov, a member of the Civic Chamber, a Kremlin advisory group. \u201cThe main hope is that the U. S. will be preoccupied with itself and will stop pressuring Russia. \u201d Any turbulence that Russia foments also gives the Kremlin leverage that it can try to trade in the global arena at a time when it does not have much that others want. Mr. Venediktov compared the Russian position to an intrusive neighbor who promises to be helpful by avoiding noisy restoration activity at night even though it breaks the apartment building rules in the first place. Analysts say the Kremlin is aware that the tactic of creating and exploiting disarray can become   in that prolonged instability could allow threats like the extremist group Islamic State to flourish. \u201cIt is important for Russia that America does its job in foreign policy,\u201d said Alexey Chesnakov, a periodic Kremlin political adviser and the director of the Center for Current Politics, a trend analysis group in Moscow. \u201cIf there is nobody to do that job, it might not be good for us, either. \u201d The Middle East provides examples of both vectors, analysts say, a moment of chaos to exploit and concerns about achieving stability for the   future. Moscow has begun courting Libya, where Mr. Putin seems to want to prove that the Obama administration and other Western powers made a mistake by working to force Col. Muammar   from power in 2011. Russia invited various powerful figures to Moscow and sent the country\u2019s lone aircraft carrier, the somewhat dilapidated Admiral Kuznetsov, on a port call to Libya on its way back from Syria last month. Khalifa Haftar, the military commander in eastern Libya, got a tour. The government invited veteran officials and analysts from around the Arab world this week to discuss the future of Libya and Yemen, among other topics. Syria, on the other hand, underscores the limits to Russian power. In the two months since   government forces took back the city of Aleppo, there has been little movement in forging peace. Not least, Russia can ill afford the billions of dollars needed to rebuild the country. For that it needs Washington to help persuade its allies like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, who all seek a political transition away from Syrian President Bashar  . Like much of the world, nobody in Moscow can figure out who makes Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy, never mind what it will be. Since the inauguration, it has become clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s rosy view of Mr. Putin is not shared by the president\u2019s top foreign policy advisers, with the possible exception of Stephen K. Bannon, his chief White House strategist. \u201cWe cannot understand how they will work in concert,\u201d said Igor Yurgens, a Russian economist who is prominent in business and development. The Kremlin has adopted a    attitude toward Mr. Trump, analysts said, expecting the first meeting with Mr. Putin in Europe sometime this summer to set the course for relations. Dmitry K. Kiselyov, the anchor of the main state propaganda program \u201cNews of the Week,\u201d recently pronounced what seemed to be the new party line on the air. \u201cLet\u2019s not judge too harshly, things are still unsettled in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cStill not a word from there. Only little words, and that doesn\u2019t amount to a policy. \u201d Just how unsettled was underscored on Monday, when the White House announced plans to increase military spending by $54 billion, an amount just about equal to what Russia spends in total on its military annually. While the appearance of such turmoil in the White House has probably been surprising, even gratifying, to the Kremlin, analysts say Russia\u2019s government is worried about having too much of a good thing. \u201cIt would be better for us to have a predictable partner,\u201d Mr. Markov said. \u201cAn unpredictable one is dangerous. \u201d The perception of weakness calls into question here in Moscow whether Mr. Trump can ever live up to the many statements he made during the campaign about forging closer ties with Mr. Putin and Russia. \u201cThe overwhelming view of the Kremlin is that Trump is not very strong,\u201d said Valeriy Solovey, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. \u201cHe might have sympathy toward Russia, but he is contained within the political establishment. \u201d Russia\u2019s far right regularly predicts Mr. Trump\u2019s assassination at the hands of the American establishment, a view occasionally echoed on state television. Alexander Dugin, a nationalist Russian philosopher, called Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration the happiest day of his life because it signified the demise of the liberal international order. Mr. Dugin seemed most eager for Mr. Trump to get on with his promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington, although he worried about the consequences. \u201cIt can kill,\u201d Mr. Dugin said in an interview. \u201cIt is not so easy to drain the swamp. \u201d Since the inauguration, however, enthusiasm for Mr. Trump in official Russia lurched from cool to uncool seemingly overnight. Dmitri S. Peskov, the presidential spokesman, denied that the new skepticism had been ordered from the top. The speed of the change was striking, however. Russia\u2019s political class marvels at how much time it now spends chewing over the minutiae of the American political system. Some attribute that to the fact that domestic politics are comatose, with Mr. Putin assured of winning another   term in 2018. \u201cNobody is talking about the Putin election,\u201d said Mr. Chesnakov, the political consultant. \u201cWe are discussing relations between Congress and Trump. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564360.907846}
