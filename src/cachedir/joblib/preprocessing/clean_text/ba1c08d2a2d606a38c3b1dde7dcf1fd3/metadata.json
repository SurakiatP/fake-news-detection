[Introduced under President Barack Obama, the WOTUS expanded the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act to include, as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, \u201calmost any piece of land that gets wet and puddles. \u201d  The Clean Water Act was intended to apply to \u201cnavigable\u201d waters, but WOTUS interpreted that extremely broadly, so that it included waters with a \u201csignificant nexus\u201d with navigable waters  \u2014   in other words, taking in water that might eventually flow into navigable waterways. The result was that the EPA could theoretically regulate everyday farming operations. The Los Angeles Times notes that \u201cfarmers knew the cavalry was coming to their rescue on election night\u201d because they expected Trump to repeal WOTUS. And on Tuesday, just hours before his first address to a special joint session of Congress, he delivered on those expectations. The Times adds: \u201cTrump had been uncharacteristically specific during his campaign about reversing the rules, and calls to \u2018Repeal WOTUS\u2019 were as common a rallying cry among growers as \u2018Build the Wall\u2019 was to his followers in rural manufacturing areas.   EPA director Scott Pruitt said in a statement: \u201cThe President\u2019s action preserves a federal role in protecting water, but it also restores the states\u2019 important role in the regulation of water. \u201d The State of California has been increasing its role in regulating water on private land, expanding its authority to include groundwater  \u2014   a response prompted by fears of overuse during the recent extreme drought and the ongoing restriction of federal water allocations due to efforts to preserve the endangered Delta smelt. With regard to federal regulation of water, however, farmers in California share their counterparts\u2019 relief  \u2014   and join those who feel satisfied that the new president is keeping his promises, regardless of \u201cresistance\u201d from Democrats and the media.
