Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d seemed to realize the significance of where they were celebrating their triumphant Emmy night after the awards ceremony Sunday. They were all at an   at an event space called Vibiana, about two blocks from the courthouse where the Simpson case was tried. A couple of decades later, the case was recreated on this FX program, which won the Emmy for best limited series, capping a big night for the show. When the Fox executive Dana Walden heard about the proximity of the courthouse to the party, she said, \u201cThat just gave me chills,\u201d a sentiment echoed by FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, who called it \u201ca little chilling. \u201d But there was one person who understood the odd coincidence of ending up back where it all started, after a circuitous and sometimes torturous route. \u201cI know where I am,\u201d Marcia Clark, the prosecutor in the Simpson case, said, a little gravely. She was sitting on a couch, inches away from the actress Sarah Paulson, who was holding the Emmy she won for portraying Ms. Clark. Ms. Clark, who was Ms. Paulson\u2019s guest at the Emmys, said she couldn\u2019t help but think about how near the courthouse was on the ride over from the ceremony. It was a bitter reminder for Ms. Clark, who was ridiculed in the news media in the    \u2014   the perception being that she had blown the prosecution and let Mr. Simpson go free. She has found her public comeback only in the last year, after the explosive popularity of the series and the sympathetic portrayal from Ms. Paulson, who in her acceptance speech for her best actress award offered up a moving public apology to Ms. Clark. \u201cThe world saw me in sound bites,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cNow I feel like I\u2019m more understood. \u201d As Ryan Murphy, the prolific television producer who shepherded this show, put it: \u201cThe great story tonight is Marcia Clark finally won. \u201d And so did FX. At the Emmys, it\u2019s usually an HBO night, and to a certain extent it was again: The premium cable channel won the best drama and comedy categories for a second consecutive year with \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cVeep. \u201d It also broke Comedy Central\u2019s hold on the variety category, with a victory by John Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight. \u2019\u2019 But propelled by a category that FX is reinventing  \u2014   the limited series  \u2014   the network arguably stole the show, smashing the basic cable Emmy record by winning 18 awards over all. The previous record was eight awards. The FX show also won acting Emmys for Courtney B. Vance\u2019s portrayal of the defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran and Sterling K. Brown\u2019s depiction of another prosecutor, Christopher Darden. (Louie Anderson won his first Emmy for his role as the mother of Zach Galifianakis\u2019s character in FX\u2019s \u201cBaskets. \u201d) Mr. Landgraf has said in the past that he feels like he has to play \u201cMoneyball\u201d to compete with his rivals. Last month, he said his budget was about a sixth the size of Netflix\u2019s. (Netflix\u2019s programming budget is about $6 billion, HBO\u2019s is $3 billion, and FX\u2019s is about $1 billion.) But despite that, FX outshined them on Sunday. The success of the O. J. show wasn\u2019t a sure thing. For decades, Hollywood did everything it could to stay away from the Bronco chase, Judge Lance A. Ito and the trial, in what proved to be a divisive national episode. \u201cLike most things, it\u2019s a   in retrospect, but it wasn\u2019t at the time,\u201d said Brad Simpson, a producer of the show, with his Emmy in hand. \u201cThere was such a heavy saturation of O. J. that nobody wanted to hear about it again. When we announced the show, all the comments were, \u2018Oh lord, don\u2019t put the country through this again.\u2019 But the show touched on things that obsesses America: class, race, the criminal justice system. \u201d By turning it into a limited series, which requires a relatively easy time commitment, FX was able to attract actors including John Travolta, Cuba Gooding Jr. and David Schwimmer. (All were nominated for awards on Sunday night.) And though the Academy Awards have been criticized for their   lineup of acting nominees, the Emmys have done better with diversity: Three   won acting awards on Sunday, including Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown from \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson. \u201d \u201cActors and directors follow the writing,\u201d Mr. Vance said at the party. \u201cThe writers in TV are writing for different hues of color. Hopefully the movies start to see that if you want to get the people, you better do the writing. \u201d Mr. Murphy, the producer, has been a regular at the Emmys (he\u2019s the man behind shows including \u201cGlee,\u201d \u201c \u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d) and he said that between the diversity onstage and the large number of   winners, Sunday night\u2019s ceremony represented \u201ca sea change. \u201d \u201cI feel like sometimes you go to those award shows, and there are some people who win over and over again, but it wasn\u2019t that type of night,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Television Academy and the voters have moved onto a different feeling, a different embrace, and it felt good. \u201d There was arguably nobody who benefited more on Sunday night than Ms. Clark. Though Ms. Paulson was joined at the hip with Ms. Clark on Sunday, the two did not meet until late in production. They\u2019ve become close since then, and Ms. Paulson provided one of the night\u2019s stirring moments when she apologized to Ms. Clark during her acceptance speech, saying that the public in the 1990s was \u201csuperficial and careless. \u201d Ms. Clark seemed to be enjoying the rehabilitation of her reputation. \u201cI think the benefit of this   was people got to see the fullness of everyone involved,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just me. Chris Darden, too. Everyone. As well as the historical context. I think everybody got more of what was going on, more than they did ever before. \u201d For two hours, Ms. Clark and Ms. Paulson sat cozily in a corner near Mr. Murphy and the \u201cNarcos\u201d star Pedro Pascal. At a little before midnight, Ms. Paulson got up to leave with Ms. Clark. As they walked through a courtyard, a group of young women were gawking at them, but they weren\u2019t interested in the one holding the Emmy. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s Marcia Clark!\u201d one woman said. Ms. Clark heard it, looked over, pointed triumphantly and waved. She walked out of the party and toward an S. U. V. with Ms. Paulson, and just a few blocks away from her first brush with fame, Ms. Clark finally had her Hollywood ending.'"}, "time": 1742561693.60346}
