Videos of the abuse show people yelling at the woman and knocking her to the ground as the insults continue. RT Michael Cohen, Trump Organization EVP and Special Counsel to Donald J. Trump, spoke out on Twitter Friday evening about Mr. Trump\u2019s desire\u2013before it was known to him that she was attacked by the Clinton mob\u2013to present an unspecified gift to the woman. Cohen said he had a friend in Hollywood looking for her. After learning she had been attacked, Cohen promised she would have \u201cthe last laugh on these thugs.\u201d . @ClydeStones she deserves to be treated with dignity and compassion. \\n\u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) October 29, 2016 A number of videos titled \u2018Crazy 4 Trump\u2019 posted on YouTube show a crowd of people surrounding the woman as she holds up banners in support for the Republican presidential nominee. Her hand-written signs promote pro-Trump messages like \u201cTwenty million illegals and Americans sleep on the streets in tents\u201d and \u201cDonald Trump \u2013 keeping it real\u201d. . @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump someone please help me locate this woman as Mr. Trump has a gift for her\u2026 \\n\u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) October 28, 2016 Some of the banners included provocative language, including one targeting the US president, reading, \u201cObama threw our black asses under the bus, he owes the Clintons, flip this script (get off the Clinton plantation).\u201d A crowd on Hollywood Boulevard, not a hotspot for Trump supporters, did not share the woman\u2019s political preferences. Nor did they choose to let her be. People are heard yelling insults at the woman, but one man temporarily stops the insults. His words calmed the crowd briefly, but verbal abuses continued as someone started accusing the woman of \u201cspewing\u201d hate. Soon, the situation turned violent, with some physically assaulting the woman and damaging her property. She was knocked off her feet, her cart overturned and her banners torn to pieces.'"}, "time": 1742561866.396266}
