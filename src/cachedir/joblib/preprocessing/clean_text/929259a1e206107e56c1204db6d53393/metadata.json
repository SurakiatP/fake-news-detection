[The \u201cAmigous Cerveza\u201d beer  has the word \u201camigo\u201d misspelled to allegedly make fun of a mispronunciation of the word by Americans, reported Reuters.  The back label of the brew says the Republican president should be \u201cin a mad house, not the White House. \u201d The chief executive of brewery, Casa Cervecera Cru Cru, Luis Enrique de la Reguera, was reported to be surprised with the success of the product. The original production was gone within a week. \u201cWe knew that a Trump label was going to be controversial, but it\u2019s been selling extremely fast,\u201d he said. Cru Cru designed the beer: similar to a New England pale ale with a hint of mango. The idea came to Cru Cru and his partner in Mexico, Error de Diciembre and Epic Brewing, before the presidential election. The Cru Cru team took to Instagram to wish President Trump a happy birthday. Best birthday ever   \u2026     HBP! A post shared by ima_lore (@ima_lore) on May 25, 2017 at 8:42am PDT,  The Republican angered some when during his speech announcing his run for the presidency in June 2015 he said: When do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they\u2019re killing us economically. The U. S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s problems. Thank you. It\u2019s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we\u2019re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They\u2019re sending us not the right people. It\u2019s coming from more than Mexico. It\u2019s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it\u2019s coming probably \u2014   probably \u2014   from the Middle East. But we don\u2019t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s got to stop and it\u2019s got to stop fast. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine later claimed, \u201cAs a candidate, [Donald Trump] started his campaign where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. \u201d As reported by Breitbart: Trump was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U. S.  border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. As Breitbart Texas has extensively documented, it\u2019s common for human traffickers to \u201cto sexually assault or rape the females\u201d en route to the U. S. and the smugglers \u201cusually remove an article of clothing from the female they rape and they tie it tightly to a tree \u2014  a rape tree. \u201d Furthermore, it is true that as the U. S. suffers from a massive heroin epidemic that killed over 47, 000 people in 2014 alone, \u201cnearly all\u201d of the heroin consumed in the U. S. is smuggled in by Mexican traffickers, as the Washington Post found. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent operation.
