Kelly, the former Fox News talent, has come under fire for her interview with Alex Jones, which is set to air on this Sunday on her Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly show. \u201cThey\u2019ve made a fundamental mistake about Megyn which is they think she\u2019s a super star,\u201d the television executive reportedly told CNN. \u201cWhat she is is a cable star, and that is a very different solar system. \u201d While promoting her show, Kelly told numerous outlets that she felt like she was born to be a mainstream media star. In a leaked recording that was released this week, Kelly even tells Alex Jones, \u201cI\u2019m a combination of Mike Wallace, Oprah Winfrey and Larry the Cable Guy. \u201d Kelly was resoundingly mocked after Jones released the audio. Mainstream media reporters and the families of the Sandy Hook victims also lambasted Kelly for telling Jones in the leaked audio, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that. \u201d CNN boss Jeff Zucker said that Kelly\u2019s interview will only work if she is \u201cholding up a picture of the dead kids at Sandy Hook and saying, \u2018How dare you? \u2019\u201d But as the New York Times observed, \u201cNBC has not released a transcript of Ms. Kelly\u2019s interview, leading some to speculate that her interrogation of Mr. Jones over his more contentious views  \u2014   for instance, that Sandy Hook was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were carried out by the United States government  \u2014   was less than ferocious. \u201d As CNN pointed out, the first month of Kelly\u2019s show has shown that wanting to be [Barbara] Walters, [Diane] Sawyer or [Oprah] Winfrey does not necessarily make it so. Establishing that reputation takes years. And in Kelly\u2019s case, it requires a transformation from her former role as a cable news host in the center of the political fray into someone more trusted by the general public. \u201d \u201cHad a trusted broadcast talent like Diane Sawyer or Lester Holt interviewed Jones, audiences may have given them greater benefit of the doubt,\u201d CNN noted. \u201cCritics of Kelly\u2019s interview might have waited to see a Sawyer or Holt interview air before casting judgment based on a brief promo. \u201d After her supposedly \u201c \u201d interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kelly did not receive stellar reviews even from her new mainstream media peers. Her interview with Erin Andrews for her second show did not draw rave reviews either. And despite NBC ginning up the hype machine in overdrive, Kelly\u2019s ratings have tanked. Her debut show could not even beat out a rerun of 60 Minutes. Her second show lost to another rerun of 60 Minutes and could not even beat out a rerun of America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos.  According to reports, NBC executives are realizing already that \u201cpeople are not tuning in to watch Megyn. \u201d NBC executives are reportedly \u201cfreaking out\u201d over the \u201cratings disaster\u201d that Kelly has turned out to be, questioning the network\u2019s $15 million investment in Kelly.'"}, "time": 1742564524.0848484}
