It didn\u2019t get any better from there, as Rick and the Gang (along with the rest of us) endured seven more weeks of misery and subjugation by the new baddie Negan and his Saviors, before finally seeming to rebound in the midseason finale. Are our heroes ready to overthrow their tormentors? Let\u2019s consider this and several additional questions leading into Sunday\u2019s second half premiere. Glenn and Abraham were the big ones, of course. We also lost Spencer and Olivia, but they were pretty marginal. Daryl and Eugene were taken by the Saviors, but Daryl escaped. Glenn and Abraham\u2019s brutal deaths set a gloomy tone for the first half of the season, which was primarily about Rick and friends grieving the loss and being victimized by Negan and the Saviors. We also met some new groups, and   \u2026     well, that was about it. But eventually enough was enough, and the midseason finale ended with the core good guys reuniting, determined to throw off the yoke of Savior oppression. The tagline for this half is Rise Up, so it seems like a safe bet. Perhaps the more pertinent question is, when will the revolt happen? Teasers find Rick on a diplomatic mission to bring groups like the Hilltop and the Kingdom into the effort. How long will it take to persuade them to join the fight? Hard to say. Will it all be resolved this season? Considering that Negan doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon, probably not. Season 7 has kicked off a new phase of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d marked by colonies that are collaborating and clashing as civilization recreates itself in a postapocalyptic dawn. So far, in addition to the Saviors and Alexandria, we\u2019ve met the weak but industrious Hilltop, led by the sniveling Gregory the Kingdom, led by the   poser King Ezekiel and Oceanside, an   group, led by the   Natania, who hates outsiders but has lots of guns. There are also the Wolves, a murderous gang that was a real problem last season but hasn\u2019t been a factor in Season 7. So is that it? Or are there more introductions to come? Based on this season\u2019s general   tendencies, it seems likely. O. K. it seems very likely. The boots in question, glimpsed in the midseason finale near the pond where Rick and Aaron found supplies, could very easily belong to someone from yet another group. In the last episode, we saw Saviors tending a herd of walkers, which may or may not be the same herd the Alexandrians loosed from the quarry at the beginning of Season 6. Whatever its provenance, the swarm seems sure to come into play somehow  \u2014   we all know what Chekhov said about zombie herds hanging out on the highway. Carol has been a real bummer this season, moping through her scant few scenes as people like Morgan and King Ezekiel tried to breach the antisocial cocoon she\u2019s spun around herself. They were unsuccessful, and after she\u2019d sufficiently healed from her gunshot wound, Carol got herself a hermit\u2019s hut on the outskirts of the Kingdom. You\u2019ll recall that the mousy housewife turned stone killer reached a breaking point last season, and sought to distance herself from others so she wouldn\u2019t have to kill again. Carol would seem to be too intelligent to believe such a policy is possible in a lawless hellscape, but perhaps we\u2019ll learn that there\u2019s more to it. Or maybe she just needed some me time. Maybe she\u2019ll learn about Glenn and Abraham, and emerge from that cocoon as a battling butterfly of righteous vengeance. Whatever the case, here\u2019s hoping she returns to the center of the show somehow, as it has suffered from the absence of both Carol and Melissa McBride, who plays her with grit and grace. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is electric in his performance, which is unfortunately also full of affected mannerisms  \u2014   wild exclamations, an odd   move  \u2014   that quickly grew tiresome. A big villain helps to give \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d focus, and Mr. Morgan has shown promise, so hopefully he and the writers will find the actual man behind the tics. What questions or hopes do you have for the second half of the season? Please share your thoughts in the comments.'"}, "time": 1742628292.9311163}
