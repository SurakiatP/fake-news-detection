[Ganahl claims that she wants to address the lack of conservatives on the faculty at the University of Colorado in her new role as the university\u2019s regent.  \u201cWell, I think that\u2019s a national problem,\u201d Ganahl said. \u201cSo it\u2019s something that I certainly want to dig into a bit and address and make sure that students are hearing both sides of the story. It\u2019s very important to me. \u201d Ganahl suggested creating classroom environments in which a conservative and a liberal teach together. She claims that setup has already been widely popular with students. \u201cAnd the kids love it. It\u2019s always full, there\u2019s always a waiting list to get a class, and that\u2019s just an example of how students really do want to hear both sides of the story and have feisty debate about tough issues and have conversations about things that they really need to figure out where they stand on,\u201d she explained.
