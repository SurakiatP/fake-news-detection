Here are a sampling of crime headlines from the first two weeks of 2017: Lewis declared on Friday he will not attend Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cI don\u2019t see the   as a legitimate president,\u201d Lewis had told NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd earlier. Revealing authentic emails from Democrats, including speeches given by Hillary Clinton about her \u201cdream\u201d of open borders, unfairly \u201cdestroyed\u201d her candidacy, Lewis complained. \u201cI think the Russians participated in having this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. I don\u2019t plan to attend the Inauguration,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians, and others, that helped him get elected. That\u2019s not right. That\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s not the open, democratic process. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562409.2336411}
