Bannon Wednesday of Hillary Clinton confidant Huma Abedin, \u201cMost of the experts I\u2019ve spoken to conclude, looking at the various facts regarding Huma\u2013her rise, where she came from, her family background, her various connections\u2013conclude that she is most likely a Saudi spy, which is my own conclusion.\u201d \\nStone also discusses the \u201cclear, deep, inarguable, indisputable connections between Huma Abedin and a Saudi Arabian official named Abdullah Omar Naseef \u2026 one of the founders of the Muslim World League (MWL). \u2026. The MWL is directly tied to the Rabita Trust, a \u201cSpecially Designated Global Terrorist Entity,\u201d which Stone previously discussed : Naseef, the Muslim World League, and the government of Pakistan created the Rabita Trust in 1988. Naseef was a sponsor and financial supporter of Syed Abedin\u2019s IMMA. Just a month after the 9/11 jihadist attack left thousands dead and brought down the World Trade Center, President George W. Bush\u2019s Executive Order designated the Rabita Trust as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity and the Treasury Department froze its assets on October 12, 2001. Naseef founded the Rabita Trust and remains involved with it to this day. A Treasury Department press release issued when Rabita Trust\u2019s assets were frozen indicated that Rabita Trust is headed by Wa\u2019el Hamza Jalaidan, one of the founders of al-Qaida with bin Laden. He was the logistics chief of bin Laden\u2019s organization and fought on bin Laden\u2019s side in Afghanistan. Jalaidan himself was branded a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity by the United States Treasury Department, and his assets have been frozen, as well. \\nStone also contended that much of what the Clintons have done via their foundation is \u201ctreasonous.\u201d \\n\u201cThey have taken money from the Chinese, the Russians, the Saudis and they\u2019d sold our country\u2019s secrets. They\u2019ve sold our country\u2019s decisions.\u201d \\nStone delved into some of the emerging details involving Hillary confidant Huma Abedin previously with Breitbart News: Huma Abedin is Vice Chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. But Huma is more, much more than that. She is the person closest to the most powerful woman in American politics and perhaps the next President. Huma has been described variously as Hillary\u2019s \u201cbody woman,\u201d a sort of glorified go-to personal maid, gentle confidant, and by others as an Islamic spy. She may be all of these things, because as we shall see, Huma Abedin has an interesting and complex career history. \\nPolitico and several other Beltway media outlets followed up on Stone\u2019s previous appearance on Breitbart News Daily: \u201c Trump Ally: Clinton Aide Could Be \u2018Terrorist Agent\u2019 \u201d: In the wake of Sunday\u2019s deadly terrorist shooting in Orlando, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime friend and informal adviser wants the presumptive Republican nominee to hit Hillary Clinton even harder, suggesting the former secretary of state\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin could be a \u201cSaudi spy\u201d or a \u201cterrorist agent.\u201d Only Trump, Roger Stone said on Sirius XM\u2019s \u201cBreitbart News Daily,\u201d will be able to draw the necessary amount of attention to the theories, which have drawn significant blowback from Democrats and Republicans alike. \u201cI also think that now that Islamic terrorism is going to be front and center, there\u2019s going to be a new focus on whether this administration, the administration of Hillary Clinton at State was permeated at the highest levels by Saudi intelligence and others who are not loyal Americans,\u201d Stone said. \u201cI speak specifically of Huma Abedin, the right-hand woman, now vice-chairman or co-chairman of vice\u2014of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564618.2243247}
