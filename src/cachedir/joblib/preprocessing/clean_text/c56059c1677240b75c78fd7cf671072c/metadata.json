Should I turn myself in? \\nWell, Ruby Ridge: that\u2019s where FBI\u2019s infamous legal murderer Lon Horiuchi shot and killed Vicki Weaver while she was holding her infant daughter Elisheba \u2013 and I got there during the FBI \u201coperation.\u201d \\nWe all know how that intentional killing went down (Horiuchi shot her at a range of some 200 yards; a trained sniper, he could have hit her at 1000). \\nMy neighbors in Idaho demanded Horiuchi be prosecuted. Idaho tried but the feds pulled the case into their compliant courts and decided that Horiuchi was \u201cjust following orders.\u201d (He\u2019s from around here and I\u2019ve had to be near him in church \u2013 yes, he goes to church \u2013 a couple of times. Had he been a Nazi prison guard, just following orders, he\u2019d have hanged long ago\u2026. I was tempted to ask him if that kill shot was really unintentional \u2026. but I digress). \\nWhat really bugged me was the FBI army that invaded nearby Sandpoint. They were everywhere \u2013 boozing, swaggering, and bragging: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get him on my shift!\u201d one lout shouted in a restaurant, to the horror of the locals who worked there (Sandpoint residents stayed home during those dismal days, hoping to avoid the determined killers\u2026. a harbinger of dark days and occupations to come). The waitresses had to walk on eggshells (Idahoans love their guns and are pretty good at using them \u2013 something a gal doesn\u2019t want to mention to a heavily-armed drunken boor far from home.) \\nIdaho\u2019s senior senator at the time, Steve Symms, had it right. \u201cWe have the election box and the jury box. If they don\u2019t work, we have the cartridge box.\u201d \\nThis time the jury box worked. 11:36 am on October 28, 2016'"}, "time": 1742628605.6840093}
