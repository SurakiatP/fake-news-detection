Trump was the   firebrand many of his supporters adore, denouncing The New York Times as a \u201cfailing\u201d institution that covered him inaccurately  \u2014   \u201cand with a nasty tone!\u201d Eight hours later, after a lunchtime interview with editors and reporters for The Times  \u2014   one that was briefly canceled, after Mr. Trump quarreled over the ground rules, then restored  \u2014   the mood of the   it seemed, had mellowed. \u201cThe Times is a great, great American jewel,\u201d Mr. Trump declared as he prepared to leave the gathering in the newspaper\u2019s   boardroom, where portraits of former presidents adorn the walls. \u201cA world jewel,\u201d added Mr. Trump, who was seated next to Arthur Sulzberger Jr. the paper\u2019s publisher. \u201cAnd I hope we can all get along. \u201d In an extraordinary   meeting  \u2014   parrying, debating and, at times, joking with the leaders of a publication that has long been an object of Mr. Trump\u2019s fascination and frustration  \u2014   the  \u2019s chameleonlike approach to the news media was on full display. Mr. Trump is inclined to label himself aggrieved and betrayed by a \u201cdishonest\u201d news media, barring some reporters from his rallies and claiming that news outlets were trying to rig the election. Only a day earlier, Mr. Trump assailed the nation\u2019s most prominent television news anchors and producers in a tense meeting at Trump Tower. But the   who arrived at The Times on Tuesday was more solicitous and measured, a handshaking businessman intent on finding common ground. He dismissed his earlier talk of strengthening libel laws, telling the assembled journalists, \u201cI think you\u2019ll be O. K. \u201d He expressed interest in improving his relationship with the paper, saying, \u201cI think it would make the job I am doing much easier. \u201d \u201cTo me,\u201d Mr. Trump said at one point, \u201cit would be a great achievement if I could come back here in a year or two, and have a lot of folks here say, \u2018You\u2019ve done a great job. \u2019\u201d Since his younger days as a Manhattan arriviste, Mr. Trump has cultivated a talent for both courting and condemning the press  \u2014   sometimes in the same breath. The gossip columnist Liz Smith recalled Mr. Trump once threatening to buy her newspaper  \u2014   \u201cin order to have the pleasure of firing me\u201d  \u2014   before warmly inviting her to his wedding. It was clear on Tuesday, however, that any new conciliatory approach toward the news media would have its limits. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been treated very rough,\u201d Mr. Trump said, as he spent the first several minutes of the session criticizing The Times\u2019s coverage. \u201cI\u2019ve been treated extremely unfairly, in a sense, in a true sense. \u201d \u201cI will say The Times is about the roughest of all,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Then, referring to his relationship with the paper, he added: \u201cI would like to turn it around. I think it would make the job I am doing much easier. \u201d The   had sounded less gracious Tuesday morning when he abruptly called off his meeting at The Times in a Twitter post, contending that the paper had changed its terms for how the conversation could be reported. A Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, said the paper had made no such changes, and said that Mr. Trump\u2019s team requested on Monday that the meeting be off the record  \u2014   a request The Times declined. Three people with knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s deliberations said that Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, had tried to scuttle the meeting at The Times by telling Mr. Trump, erroneously, that the newspaper was shifting its terms. Mr. Priebus had been among those urging the   to cancel his interview because he could face questions he might not be prepared to answer, these people said. (A spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment on Mr. Priebus\u2019s role.) By midmorning, the meeting was back on, with both sides confirming that Mr. Trump and members of his staff would attend. The meeting coincided with the paper\u2019s annual State of The Times address as the publisher and top executives presented the company\u2019s strategy, Secret Service agents patrolled The Times\u2019s lobby, which filled with people, including a throng of photographers, in anticipation of Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival. Before the lunch, Mr. Trump met privately for about 15 minutes with Mr. Sulzberger, a meeting that Ms. Murphy described as short and cordial. At lunch  \u2014   where salmon, beef tenderloin and squash were on the menu, although the   and many of the journalists did not eat  \u2014   Mr. Trump seemed unconcerned about criticism of Breitbart News, the   conservative website that embraced his candidacy and whose former chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, is now his chief strategist. Breitbart, which features articles about violent migrants in Europe, has warned of a wave of \u201c   crime,\u201d and has been denounced as racist,   and xenophobic. Mr. Trump called it \u201cjust a newspaper, essentially. \u201d Pressed about the concerns of   Jewish groups and others about Breitbart\u2019s coverage under Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump seemed to sidestep the question. \u201cBreitbart really is a news organization that has become quite successful,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s got readers, and it does cover subjects on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. It\u2019s a pretty big thing. \u201d The final question of the lunch carried implications for every news outlet that plans to cover the administration of a man who has boasted that he would change laws to make it easier for Americans to sue for libel: Is a President Trump committed to the First Amendment? \u201cOh, I was hoping he wasn\u2019t going to ask that,\u201d Mr. Trump replied with a smile. \u201cActually,\u201d the   added, \u201csomebody said to me on that, they said, \u2018You know, it\u2019s a great idea softening up those laws, but you may get sued a lot more.\u2019 I said, \u2018You know, you\u2019re right, I never thought of that. \u2019\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019ll be O. K.,\u201d Mr. Trump added, suggesting that he would not modify libel laws, although he did not offer a definitive stance one way or the other. By Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump had not yet posted on Twitter his opinion of how things went at The Times. But during the lunch, he made a confession: He remains a regular reader. \u201cI do read it  \u2014   unfortunately,\u201d the   said. \u201cI\u2019d live about 20 years longer if I didn\u2019t. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563940.3284686}
