But what happens when the circus leaves town? Much more than in the past. Few cities have come so far and so fast as Miami in terms of creating new,   arts institutions. The last three years in particular have been a flurry of activity  \u2014   indeed, many of the biggest museums and cultural centers weren\u2019t around before 2013, or they existed in smaller, less ambitious forms. Buildings designed by acclaimed international architects have been constructed or are underway,   campaigns have struck gold with a few choice donors, and leaders for the new institutions have flocked to Miami from all over. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkably robust,\u201d said Thomas Collins, now the executive director and president of the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. He lived in Miami for six years, helping to start 2013\u2019s P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami (known as PAMM, and formerly the Miami Art Museum) and its new facility, designed by the renowned Swiss architecture firm Herzog  de Meuron. \u201cEvery time someone launched a new institution, I thought, \u2018This is it, we don\u2019t have enough resources or audience,\u2019\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cBut that hasn\u2019t proven true. \u201d The newest entry, debuting this week, is one of the most unusual: Miami Beach\u2019s Faena Forum, a structure topped by a dome and oculus that was designed by the architect Rem Koolhaas\u2019s firm, OMA, at a cost of some $150 million. The Forum, intended to anchor the larger Faena District in the   area, will host programming by the separate nonprofit group Faena Art, but will also be put to other noncultural uses, including   events. Faena Art is the brainchild of two Argentines, the real estate developer and hotelier Alan Faena and his wife, the curator Ximena Caminos. It aims to fill a gap in local cultural offerings, with an emphasis on performance rather than static exhibitions. Some will occur at the Forum, and some elsewhere, and all the events are free. The   Forum was supposed to open a year ago. \u201cIt\u2019s finally here,\u201d said Ms. Caminos, who directs Faena Art. She and Mr. Faena moved to Miami three years ago. They started the Faena Art programming with a typically nontraditional event this week, a \u201cprocessional\u201d called \u201cTide by Side\u201d that was conceived by the performance art specialist Claire Tancons. \u201cThe scene has been developing,\u201d Ms. Caminos said of Miami. \u201cIt\u2019s stronger and more layered. \u201d Despite the opening events this week that are timed to the art fairs, \u201cWe want to change the center of gravity to other parts of the year,\u201d Ms. Caminos said. \u201cIt can\u2019t only be driven by Art Basel. We\u2019re more focused on locals, not those migratory birds. \u201d Faena Art\u2019s performance and lecture series, \u201cSoledades,\u201d began this week at Faena Forum with a dance event, \u201cOnce With Me, Once Without Me. \u201d In the spring the Forum will host the Biennale of Moving Images. Many of the leaders of the other top institutions also hail from elsewhere, including Franklin Sirmans, a former curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art who succeeded Mr. Collins as director of PAMM a year ago. Mr. Sirmans noted one of the traditional strengths of the city. \u201cOne of the distinctions of Miami is that we have all these private collections,\u201d he said, referring to the Rubell Family Collection, the de la Cruz Collection and the Margulies Collection, among others, all of which are open to the public. \u201cBut as the public museum, our responsibility is different,\u201d he said, referring to the PAMM\u2019s effort to reach a large audience with varied programming. Heterogeneity, he said, is baked into Miami\u2019s art scene. \u201cThat\u2019s another distinctive thing about us,\u201d Mr. Sirmans said. \u201cMost people are from somewhere else.   percent or so speak Spanish, 50 percent are not born here. We are a city that builds itself off our diversity. \u201d Latin America is a natural focus for PAMM and is reflected in the programming at the museum, which in November introduced three exhibitions including \u201cJulio Le Parc: Form into Action,\u201d a survey of the   artist that remains on view until March 19. The museum just announced that it received a large new gift from the benefactor whose name is already on the door  \u2014   the billionaire real estate developer Jorge M. P\u00e9rez  \u2014   consisting of $10 million cash and a group of 200 works by Cuban artists valued at $5 million. Mr. P\u00e9rez, whose initial $40 million gift   the museum\u2019s building project, said that as a younger city than New York or Boston, Miami was still developing its philanthropic habits. \u201cOur money is new money,\u201d he said. Mr. P\u00e9rez added that having strong   programming was the key to staying vibrant. \u201cIt\u2019s great for Miami to have a place that tourists come to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the main reason for the museum is to serve Miamians. \u201d Mr. Sirmans stressed that the museum was not relying on just one donor to fuel its future ambitions. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the usual suspects,\u201d he said of PAMM\u2019s patrons. \u201cIt\u2019s a deeper bench than you think. \u201d The collectors Irma and Norman Braman are solely funding 2017\u2019s most important opening, a new Design District home for the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami. The ICA. founded in 2014, has been operating in temporary quarters, but next December it plans to move into a   foot building by the Spanish architectural firm Aranguren + Gallegos Arquitectos (the cost has not yet been disclosed). The ICA\u2019s new director, Ellen Salpeter, started her job less than a year ago, after working as a deputy director at the Jewish Museum in New York. With the wave of new institutions, the leadership of each one is thinking about how to distinguish itself among the others. The ICA, Ms. Salpeter said, is \u201cnimble, a smaller museum than the P\u00e9rez. We\u2019re something you can duck into and see a show. \u201d She added that the role of the ICA, which has free admission, thanks to philanthropic support from a variety of patrons, was to stage groundbreaking exhibits, like the current show, \u201cOne Day on Success Street,\u201d the first major American survey of the German artist Thomas Bayrle. \u201cWe specialize in firsts,\u201d Ms. Salpeter said. She said that the Miami art scene still had a ways to go, especially in terms of art galleries and small, nonprofit spaces. But there are certainly signs the Miami wave has not yet crested, as even the older institutions spruce themselves up. The Bass Museum of Art, a contemporary museum founded in 1964, is closed as it undergoes a $12 million renovation scheduled to be revealed this spring. Ms. Salpeter echoed the other Miami leaders in saying that the   activity, rather than creating an adversarial environment, was welcome. She added, \u201cA rising tide lifts all boats. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628470.7541785}
