If that\u2019s what you\u2019ve gotta do for a laugh, your in the wrong game.  \u2014   Nick Wright (@itsnik3) April 3, 2017,  Epps defended the stunt in a social media message that has been deleted. A video, captured and published by The Shade Room, shows the comedian feeding a banana to a Kangaroo. \u201cYeh look how nice Iam 2 him! Theses guys are license zoo keepers ! #iloveanimals,\u201d Epps wrote on Instagram. He later posted an apology note to his social media account, and said he would be donating to a kangaroo conservation charity. According to TMZ, the kangaroo that appeared onstage Friday night belongs to traveling zoo animal handler Javon Stacks. Stacks told the gossip outlet that the animal was not harmed in any way during Friday night\u2019s performance. However, according to a   report from the outlet, the U. S. Department of Agriculture is investigating the incident to determine whether the kangaroo handler was in control of the animal at all times, a requirement under the federal Animal Welfare Act. Epps was recently tapped to play the lead role in the forthcoming Lee   bio drama, Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said? The film, which the Weinstein Company will produce, will reportedly star Eddie Murphy, Kate Hudson, and Oprah Winfrey.
