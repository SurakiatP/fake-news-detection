It was hastily erected in recent days, and is meant to separate the hundreds of thousands of protesters expected to descend on Bras\u00edlia, the Brazilian capital, this weekend as members of Congress vote on whether to begin impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff. The left side of the wall, facing Congress, is reserved for supporters of the   Ms. Rousseff, the right for people demanding her ouster. \u201cIt\u2019s not pretty, but the wall is necessary to keep the two sides from tearing each other apart,\u201d a    police officer in    riot gear said as she stood in the searing sun on Friday afternoon. \u201cWhen these protesters come together, they behave like soccer hooligans. \u201d Brazilian politics is a blood sport in the best of times, but the battle over Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment is inflaming passions as never before, cleaving families, turning friends into enemies and transforming children into unwitting surrogates for the warring sides. Social media has been flooded with venom, and those who claim to be neutral often find themselves accused of treachery. On the streets of Brazilian cities, political rallies organized by one side or the other have been devolving into shouting matches or worse, including a brawl last month in S\u00e3o Paulo that left a former city councilor with a bloody lip. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will turn into a civil war because you\u2019d have to be stupid to fight for these politicians, but people are very stressed right now,\u201d said Rafael Alcadipani da Silveira, 39, a professor of organizational studies at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, one of the country\u2019s top universities. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen things this bad. \u201d Political passions have turned ordinary sartorial decisions into perceived acts of provocation. Lauana de Lima Oliveira, 22, a saleswoman from S\u00e3o Paulo, recalled a recent day when she decided to go to work in a red tank top. Red is the color associated with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party. As she rode in a crowded subway car, several passengers began to elbow her while hissing \u201cpetralha,\u201d a pejorative for party stalwarts. Ms. de Lima Oliveira, who said she was agnostic on the impeachment drive, was stunned. \u201cPeople have become like horses that wear blinders so they can\u2019t see anything on either side of them,\u201d she said. \u201cRed happens to be my favorite color, and I\u2019m not going to stop wearing it. \u201d In the southern city of Porto Alegre, Ariane Leit\u00e3o, a surrogate councilwoman with the Workers\u2019 Party, filed a formal complaint against her longtime pediatrician who, citing Ms. Leit\u00e3o\u2019s party affiliation, abruptly cut off ties. \u201cGiven all that has happened,\u201d the doctor wrote to her, according to the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. \u201cI am not in the position to treat your son. \u201d Most alarming, experts say, is the extent to which the political maelstrom has affected those too young to vote. Last month, students at a private school in S\u00e3o Paulo reportedly terrorized a    boy after he showed up to class wearing a red shirt emblazoned with the Swiss flag  \u2014   a gesture of neutrality, according to his father, who discussed the episode on Facebook in a posting shared more than 4, 500 times. School officials say many children have been parroting the caustic expressions they hear at home, and teachers at one school in S\u00e3o Paulo were alarmed when a child drew a picture of Ms. Rousseff hanging by a noose. Ilana Katz, a psychoanalyst who works with children, said she was worried that many young people were learning intolerance from their parents, and that it is acceptable to express disagreements through aggression. \u201cIt\u2019s this idea that there is only one way to live, and that those who live differently need to be eliminated,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be teaching the opposite of that. \u201d For   the fallout has been even more pronounced. Among urban professionals, it\u2019s common to hear stories about relationships that have been shattered by the mounting political warfare. F\u00e1tima Nobre, 57, an advertising executive, said a neighbor threw her out of his apartment during lunch a few weeks ago when she expressed support for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. \u201cIt was as if he was channeling Dilma\u2019s spirit, like he had turned into the devil,\u201d she said, referring to the president by her first name. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be friends with a person like that. \u201d The most searing rancor often finds expression on Facebook, where Brazilians\u2019 postings about pets and food have been almost entirely supplanted by political shouting matches. Andressa Umeki, 34, a journalist, said a verbal imbroglio on Facebook ended her relationship with a cousin who used to shower her with words of affection. After Ms. Umeki publicly cast her lot with the opposition seeking impeachment, the cousin unfriended her. \u201cWe used to speak by phone but not anymore,\u201d she added. Alarmed by the surge in social strife, some Brazilians have taken a hard line on political chatter. Tarciano Andr\u00e9 Barbosa, 40, a tech analyst in S\u00e3o Paulo, said he had to warn his    about cracking political jokes during his daughter\u2019s recent birthday party. \u201cYou see people on TV in the Middle East throwing bombs at one another, and here we are fighting, too, though in a different way,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have become so extremist. It\u2019s absurd, and in the end this will pass, but relationships can\u2019t be lost over ignorance. \u201d Though it sometimes feels as if all of Brazilian society is consumed by the machinations taking place in Bras\u00edlia, those who study the growing polarization say much of the fury is confined to older,   professionals. Pablo Ortellado, a professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo who studies protest movements in Brazil, said a recent survey he conducted showed that   Brazilians and people under 35 had largely stayed away from the political rallies that were roiling many cities. \u201cEven I was surprised by the results because it sometimes seems that these protests are affecting all of society,\u201d he said. His hypothesis? Because educated, older Brazilians came of age when the Workers\u2019 Party was battling the dictatorship that ruled Brazil until the   they are more invested in the outcome of the current political struggle. \u201cEither they are still enthusiastic for the party or they feel betrayed by the party or they never liked it,\u201d Mr. Ortellado said, adding that he felt optimistic that younger Brazilians would one day be less dogmatic about party politics. \u201cIt points to a future, perhaps 10 years from now, when we can work out our political differences in another way. \u201d Even at the wall that cleaves the national mall, such levelheaded pragmatism was not hard to find. On Friday afternoon, two colleagues from the Ministry of Health spent their lunch break taking photos of each other amid a phalanx of riot police. The men, Leonardo Ferreira de Almeida, 28, and Wanderson Gontijo, 38, are on opposite sides in the impeachment debate  \u2014   and acknowledged spending way too much time at work talking politics  \u2014   but they said their discussions rarely turned venomous. \u201cThe way I see it, democracy is an opportunity to have different opinions but to not be blind to the weaknesses of your argument,\u201d said Mr. Almeida, a social policy analyst at the ministry. Mr. Gontijo, a technology specialist, nodded in agreement and then looked at the wall, which was already festooned with posters comparing it to the Berlin Wall. \u201cThis is a shame because it doesn\u2019t represent democracy,\u201d he said. With that, the men threw their arms around each other, smiled broadly and posed for one more photograph.'"}, "time": 1742563010.559228}
