In it, Donald Trump\u2019s name is left off of the ballot whil Hillary Clinton\u2019s is listed twice. \\nThe doctored photo hit Twitter and has since been re-tweeted tens of thousands of times. Take a look at the picture for yourself: \\n\u2014 Hatrick Penry (@Hatrick__Penry) October 24, 2016 Hey guys, seriously? How is this not viral yet? Are we going to be taken as that stupid and let it go? This is an Oregon Ballot. pic.twitter.com/4eSSrK3aaB \\n\u2014 Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) October 27, 2016 \\nAbout an hour after John Laussier started the hoax, he took responsibility for it and admitted that it wasn\u2019t real: \u201cIn case its not super obvious that last tweet from me is a hoax. Don\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet folks.\u201d Is Trump on the Oregon ballot? YES. But a hoax grabbed a lot of retweets today. Official sample ballot >>> https://t.co/LR1smKW2pO pic.twitter.com/WvMIhyzUHz \\n\u2014 KVAL News (@KVALnews) October 21, 2016 \\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping people figure out soon this was fake, and, in the future, look at what they\u2019re passing on,\u201d Laussier told KATU . \u201cWe\u2019ve got to act responsibly. Get out your ballots, take a good hard look, and vote with some research!\u201d \\nLaussier told KATU that it was \u201cirresponsible of me to post the tweet,\u201d and he apologized. LawNewz reported : \\nThe Oregon Secretary of State\u2019s Office told KGQ that they are evaluating whether the hoax violated election law. Spokesperson Molly Woon emphasized to the television station that the Oregon Secretary of State is \u201cconfident\u201d in the election process. \\nWhile Laussier makes a good point about people being discerning about what they share on the internet, there are a couple of important points here. \\nFirst, there is good reason for people to be vigilant about voter fraud . There are numerous reports of the problem across the country and it\u2019s good that people are paying attention. \\nSecond, the mainstream media is largely in the tank for Clinton and operates as a propaganda machine. Most people don\u2019t have the time \u2014 or if they do, don\u2019t have the resources \u2014 to thoroughly vet something they come across. You know who has both? The media\u2026 but they refuse to do so because of their bias. \\nIf this ballot was real, people may have been able to force change by bringing light to what would have been a serious problem. \\nThat certainly doesn\u2019t mean that people shouldn\u2019t be discerning or that they should repost or re-tweet everything they come across. There\u2019s something to be said for people being vigilant, paying attention, and forcing those in the media and those in positions to do something about it to take a look. \\nNow, that doesn\u2019t mean that people should automatically believe that something\u2019s true and adjust their beliefs/voting decision because of it; it just means that it\u2019s good that people are paying attention and forcing those in a position to check it out to do so. \\nWhile Laussier\u2019s tweet was an interesting experiment, the timing was poor given the rampant voter fraud going on throughout the country. This was a hoax, but there are plenty of instances where it isn\u2019t, and people shouldn\u2019t be discouraged from being vigilant about it.'"}, "time": 1742563519.8731813}
