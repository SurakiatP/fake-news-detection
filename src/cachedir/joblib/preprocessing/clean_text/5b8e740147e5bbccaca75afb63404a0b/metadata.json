The justice, Teori Zavascki, 68, was killed along with at least two other people traveling on a Beechcraft King Air C90 when it crashed into the Atlantic near Paraty, a town of   buildings on the coast between S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, according to Brazilian news reports. The cause of the crash was unknown as of Thursday night. The federal police have begun an investigation that will be closely watched across Brazil, given Justice Zavascki\u2019s influence in Brazil\u2019s legal system. Justice Zavascki, who had kept a low public profile since being named to the   court in 2012, was responsible for some of the boldest moves in Brazil\u2019s judiciary in recent years, earning him a reputation as a judge prepared to curb abuses by influential lawmakers and business leaders. In 2015, Justice Zavascki ordered the arrest and imprisonment of Delc\u00eddio do Amaral, a sitting senator from the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, which was in power at the time. And in 2016, he ousted the speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, who had orchestrated the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Large portions of Brazil\u2019s political establishment are on edge over revelations of bribery by Odebrecht, the construction giant that was one of the largest contractors for Petrobras, the   oil company. Justice Zavascki was overseeing the ratification of Odebrecht\u2019s plea deal, in which dozens of Brazilian politicians are accused of receiving funds from the company, and some prominent figures suggested that the plane crash could have been a result of foul play. \u201cThis \u2018accident\u2019 needs to be thoroughly investigated,\u201d M\u00e1rcio Adriano Anselmo, a federal investigator on the Petrobras case, said in a Facebook post. Mr. Anselmo called Justice Zavascki\u2019s death \u201cthe prelude to the end of an era\u201d before editing and removing parts of the post. Justice Zavascki\u2019s death raises important concerns about the direction of the Petrobras investigation and the independence of the judiciary. President Michel Temer will be able to nominate a replacement, influencing the Supreme Court while his own   Brazilian Democratic Movement Party is facing intense criticism over graft cases and efforts to stifle the Petrobras inquiry. Within the court, justices were maneuvering quickly on Thursday to nominate a successor to oversee the Petrobras case, expressing concern about delays that could allow legislators to avoid going to jail. Under Brazilian law, the Supreme Court handles cases involving lawmakers and other senior politicians who enjoy special legal standing. Justice Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello said it would be a mistake to await Mr. Temer\u2019s nomination of a new court member, which would be followed by Senate hearings that could take almost a year. \u201cWe cannot wait,\u201d Mr. Mello said, citing the demands of the Petrobras investigation, called Operation Carwash in reference to a service station in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, that laundered money. The plane carrying Justice Zavascki was owned by Emiliano, a Brazilian luxury hotel operator. The owner of Emiliano, Carlos Alberto Filgueiras, 69, and the pilot of the plane, Osmar Rodrigues, 56, also died in the crash. The hotel company said in a statement that Justice Zavascki and Mr. Filgueiras were \u201cclose friends. \u201d Brazilian news outlets also reported that a woman, whose identity was not disclosed, had died. Justice Zavascki, a specialist in tax legislation before becoming a judge, was named to the court by Ms. Rousseff, who was replaced last year by Mr. Temer, her vice president. Sergio Moro, the judge overseeing much of the Petrobras inquiry, called Justice Zavascki \u201can example for all judges, prosecutors and lawyers in this country. \u201d \u201cWithout him, there would not have been the Carwash investigation,\u201d Judge Moro said. Legal scholars agreed that Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court, along with Justice Zavascki\u2019s replacement, would come under scrutiny. \u201cThis thing isn\u2019t for amateurs,\u201d said Antonio Valverde, a professor of ethics and philosophy at Catholic University in S\u00e3o Paulo, citing reports that some of Brazil\u2019s most powerful men received bribes in the Carwash inquiry. \u201cThe names in those reports are in the federal government. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564164.1428711}
