[In his latest exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie takes aim at critics who say Israel\u2019s embassy cannot possibly be moved to Jerusalem from its current location in Tel Aviv.  \u201cIt\u2019s as if somebody would get mad that you moved the capital [of the United States] to Washington,\u201d Jackie says. \u201cImagine if another country decided that the American capital doesn\u2019t deserve to be in Washington because they don\u2019t like it, because they said we\u2019re occupying their territory by being there. People that you\u2019ve never heard of, that were never there before. \u201d Jackie says that as far as Arab countries in the Middle East are concerned, Israel doesn\u2019t have a right to exist anywhere. \u201cIf they had their way, every Israeli and every Jew would be wiped out immediately, so how would they have a capital any place if they don\u2019t even have a right to be here?\u201d Jackie asks. Still, the comedian holds no ill will toward these Arab countries, even though they\u2019d prefer he\u2019d drop dead. In his first cable news interview from the White House on Thursday, President Trump signaled it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to discuss his plans to move the embassy to Jerusalem.
