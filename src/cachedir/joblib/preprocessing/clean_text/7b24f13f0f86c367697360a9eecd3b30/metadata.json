The United States Pacific Command said in a statement that one of two Chinese jets involved in an intercept operation on Tuesday had \u201can unsafe excessive rate of closure on the   aircraft. \u201d \u201cThis seems to be a case of improper airmanship, as no other provocative or unsafe maneuvers occurred,\u201d the Pacific Command said. The episode was the second report of an unsafe intercept recently by a Chinese jet tracking an American spy plane in the waters around China. Last month, the Pentagon said two Chinese fighter jets flew dangerously close to an   aircraft off the coast of Hainan, the southernmost province of China. In that case, the Chinese plane flew within 50 feet of the American plane over the South China Sea, breaking an agreement on safe conduct in the air that Beijing and Washington signed last year, the Pentagon said. The American plane had been on a routine patrol, the Pentagon said then. The East China Sea is a delicate area for China and Japan, an American treaty ally. Islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, a group of uninhabited rocks in the East China Sea, are at the center of a bitter territorial dispute between the two countries, which regularly send patrol ships close to them. China\u2019s Ministry of Defense told Global Times, a   Chinese newspaper, that the United States was \u201cdeliberately hyping up the issue of reconnaissance by American military aircraft near China. \u201d Chinese military pilots always operate according to the rules and act in a \u201cprofessional and responsible\u201d manner, a ministry spokesman who was not identified by the newspaper was quoted as saying on Wednesday. The commander of the Pacific Command, Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. said at a conference in Singapore last weekend that he had seen \u201cpositive behavior\u201d by Chinese military aircraft and ships recently. \u201cEvery now and then, you\u2019ll see an incident in the air that we may judge to be unsafe,\u201d Admiral Harris said. \u201cThose are really, over the course of time, rare. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628371.357086}
