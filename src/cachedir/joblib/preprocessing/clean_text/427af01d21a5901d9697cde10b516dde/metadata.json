The speech by President Bashar   was his first major address since the effort to mediate an end to the civil war broke down in Geneva in April. It reflected his sense that Russian intervention in the war has bolstered his position  \u2014   and his ability to remain in power for the foreseeable future  \u2014   as the war enters its sixth year. Mr. Assad\u2019s defiance was notable partly because of efforts in recent months by Secretary of State John Kerry and other leaders of a   collaboration, known as the International Syria Support Group, to set a series of deadlines and limits that Syria could not violate. Every one of the directives has been broken. A   devised in Munich in February collapsed. Mr. Kerry\u2019s demand at that time  \u2014   that humanitarian access had to begin within weeks  \u2014   was briefly observed in a few towns before access was again largely blocked. \u201cThe speech was, unfortunately, vintage Assad  \u2014   unrepentant and damaging to international efforts to end the brutal civil war that has ravaged the country for more than five years  \u2014   the same international efforts that his principal backers, Russia and Iran, support,\u201d Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday night. \u201cHis remarks show once again how delusional, detached and unfit he is to lead the Syrian people. \u201d Mr. Toner argued that Syria was defying not just Mr. Kerry, but also its two most vital allies, Russia and Iran. Mr. Kerry was in Beijing and, because of the time difference, could not be reached for his reaction to Mr. Assad\u2019s speech, Mr. Toner said. Three weeks ago in Vienna, Mr. Kerry appeared before reporters to declare that if Mr. Assad continued to obstruct humanitarian convoys, the West would help the United Nations relief agency conduct airdrops of supplies to starving towns, beginning June 1. The deadline passed with little comment by Mr. Kerry or the State Department. It remains unclear when those airdrops will commence, if at all. At the same Vienna conference, Mr. Kerry rejected the notion that President Obama and other allies would not use force to stop the Syrian government\u2019s indiscriminate bombings or enforce humanitarian access. \u201cIf President Assad has come to a conclusion there\u2019s no Plan B,\u201d he said, \u201cthen he\u2019s come to a conclusion that is totally without any foundation whatsoever and even dangerous. \u201d Mr. Kerry, administration officials said, submitted to the White House months ago a \u201cPlan B\u201d that called for escalated military action if Mr. Assad continued his defiance. Mr. Obama has not acted on it, telling aides he was not convinced the plan could make a significant difference, especially since Syria\u2019s Arab neighbors and European powers have not offered more than token support. Mr. Obama is wary of drawing the United States deeper into a conflict in which he initially saw no vital American interest. Mr. Kerry and other officials, in private, have argued that the size of the humanitarian disaster in Syria and the flow of refugees into Europe have created such an interest. But with only seven months left in office, Mr. Obama seems unlikely to change his mind. Mr. Assad spoke as the Syrian authorities imposed new obstacles on international efforts to transport emergency aid to civilians trapped in   areas. United Nations officials in Geneva said government approval was withheld for a delayed food convoy to Daraya, a suburb of Damascus that received medical aid last week for the first time in four years. Mr. Assad was clear on Tuesday that he had no intention of compromising with his adversaries, and seemed to reject the next deadline: an Aug. 1 target for developing a \u201ctransition plan\u201d that Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry have said must ultimately result in someone else running what is left of Syria. In his speech, Mr. Assad said the peace talks that broke down were a \u201c \u201d effort by opponents who have been seeking to depose him since the war started in 2011, during the Arab Spring. \u201cWhen they failed to achieve what they wanted, their response was an open declaration of supporting terrorism,\u201d Mr. Assad said in the speech made in Parliament, as reported by the state news agency and broadcast on national television. Mr. Assad\u2019s adversaries reacted with a mix of fury and frustration. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing behavior that is the most extreme, the full military solution,\u201d said Bassma Kodmani, a member of the High Negotiations Committee, an opposition group that had been negotiating with the Syrian government through United Nations mediation. \u201cSeventeen countries have agreed on something, does this have no value at all?\u201d Ms. Kodmani said. Mr. Assad seems unlikely to be able to make good on his boast to retake his country. His strength is largely limited to areas where there is a strong presence of his minority Alawite sect. But bolstered by Russia\u2019s intervention nine months ago to help prop him up, Mr. Assad is stronger than he has been in years, many experts say, and he has rejected the idea that any new government would have to exclude him. He has the strong support of Iran, his longtime provider of security, though Russian officials seem less concerned about whether Mr. Assad himself remains in power. An announcement by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in March that he was pulling back from Syria appeared to be largely a charade. Russian airstrikes helped the Syrian Army retake the ancient city of Palmyra from the Islamic State that same month. The Russians have also been helping Assad loyalists elsewhere, including against insurgents in and around the city of Aleppo and other parts of northern Syria. Some of these groups are supported by the United States. \u201cJust like we liberated Palmyra and many other areas before it,\u201d Mr. Assad said in the speech, \u201cwe are going to liberate each and every inch of Syria from their hands because we have no other choice but to win. \u201d Behind the scenes, Mr. Kerry has been talking frequently to Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, to seek assurances that Russia was aiming first at Islamic State forces, and not bombing other insurgent groups. State Department officials offered no details of those discussions, repeating a standard line that they are asking Russia \u201cto use its influence\u201d to allow humanitarian intervention. There appears to be no plan to turn the calls for airdrops  \u2014   which Mr. Lavrov echoed  \u2014   into a reality. At the same time, evidence suggests that many of the groups the United States is backing are under periodic attack from Russia and ground forces supported by Iran. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear Assad\u2019s defiance and rigidity at the negotiating table continues to increase after the Russian intervention,\u201d said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t bode well for the political negotiations in Geneva to find a political settlement. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628565.3813412}
