[This is not an entirely surprising development because the ICC has made it clear all along that it considers Qaddafi\u2019s case very much open. It was not clear until now just how aggressively the court would pursue him, but it was made very clear indeed in a statement on Wednesday from chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.  Bensouda declared that the 2011 arrest warrant against Saif \u201cremains valid, and Libya is obliged to immediately arrest and surrender Mr. Qaddafi. \u201d She called upon any other state that has an opportunity to arrest Qaddafi to do so if he leaves Libya.  \u201cHelping a fugitive to escape justice must not be tolerated, and Mr. Gaddafi must be surrendered to the custody of the Court,\u201d Bensouda declared. She added this directive supersedes \u201cany purported amnesty law in Libya. \u201d One of Libya\u2019s several governments declared an amnesty throughout the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Another Libyan government sentenced Qaddafi to death in absentia in 2015 and has given no indication of rescinding its judgment. Human Rights Watch (HRW) applauded the ICC\u2019s demand to bring Saif   to justice, citing a U. N. Security Council resolution requiring Libyan authorities to cooperate with the ICC, while also accusing his former captors of   abuses for their treatment of him. \u201cThe reported release of Gaddafi based on a flawed amnesty law does not change the fact that he is wanted by the ICC for crimes against humanity. The Zintan brigade, which alleges that it released him, should urgently disclose his current whereabouts,\u201d said HRW International Justice Director Richard Dicker. However, Human Rights Watch also noted that the Zintan brigade held Qaddafi incommunicado, subjected him to solitary confinement, denied him access to legal counsel, illegally interrogated him, and held him long after the Libyan government the brigade nominally answers to ordered his release.  Also, HRW noted that the Libyan court which sentenced Qaddafi to death did not meet international fair trial standards and cited the wording of the Libyan amnesty law to point out that it does not cover the   offenses Qaddafi stands accused of, concluding that only the International Criminal Court can handle the case. In fact, Human Rights Watch wants the ICC to take over more investigations and prosecutions of Libyans on all sides of its   conflict for human rights violations, including the abuse of migrants.'"}, "time": 1742564167.8869953}
