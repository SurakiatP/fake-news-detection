In barely two months, the Donald will take office, ejecting the Democrats\u2019 coterie of corrupt courtiers and beginning his mission to right America\u2019s wrongs . But President Trump can\u2019t do it alone: he needs good, talented people to work under him and carry out the hard work of making America great again.\\nThat\u2019s where you come in.\\nThe Trump administration is now soliciting people to apply for jobs for when the man himself takes office in January. We are officially calling on all ready and able Return Of Kings readers to submit their applications and take up any job offers. Here\u2019s why you should consider a job in President Trump\u2019s administration (beyond obvious reasons such as money and prestige)\u2026\\n1. It\u2019ll help keep President Trump accountable \\nWhile the media is lying about Trump reneging on his campaign promises, it\u2019s still a good idea to give the man more reasons to keep his word. By staffing his administration with committed nationalists, we\u2019ll make it easier for President Trump to fulfill his political program, as well as make it more difficult for him to go back on his promises. Remember, it was rank-and-file FBI agents who forced James Comey to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton ; a leader needs loyal men in order to carry out his agenda.\\n2. You\u2019ll be able to make history \\nGiven the momentous task of rebuilding America after eight years of Obama\u2019s perfidy and failure, you almost have a civic duty to help President Trump in his mission. Expecting America to become great again all on its own is delusional; we need to do our part to restore this nation\u2019s glory. By working with the Trump administration, you\u2019ll have a direct role in reshaping America for years\u2014possibly decades\u2014to come.\\n3. You\u2019ll help trigger the left \\nDespite their massive losses in the election\u2014beyond Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, the Democrats now control only a handful of state governments and failed to dent the GOP\u2019s Congressional majority\u2014the leftist mainstream media is trying to order Trump around and persuade him to staff his administration with the same flacks who filled Bush\u2019s and Obama\u2019s. Right now, they\u2019re freaking out over Breitbart executive chairman Stephen Bannon being appointed as Trump\u2019s chief strategist .\\nBy joining the Trump administration, you\u2019ll have a hand in helping trigger the left into conniption fits and spasms of impotence. Nothing horrifies them more than losing access to the levers of power, which they\u2019ve controlled for decades. Watching leftists squirm and cry is one of the biggest fringe benefits of Trump\u2019s victory, and we need to keep the triggering up for years to come.\\nIf you think you have the job skills, Return Of Kings highly recommends you apply for a job in Trump\u2019s administration . President Trump may have started the fire, but it\u2019s our job to help the fire rise.\\nRead More: Did The Anti-Donald Trump Riot In Chicago Help Trump Cruise To Victory On Tuesday? \\n'"}, "time": 1742561719.9878688}
