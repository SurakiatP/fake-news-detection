Crowdsourcing,    rentals like Airbnb: An interest, exemplified by millennials, in a temporary ownership of goods. Apps, not objects. What, then, to make of objects? In a culture being redefined by the way it consumes, what to make of people who collect things, who keep things? What to make of the personal archives, the private universes, the physical stabs at permanence and immortality that collectors create? \u201cThe Keeper,\u201d the New Museum\u2019s summer show, a   exhibit that opens on Wednesday, July 20, is a museum blockbuster of a different kind. With over 4, 000 objects representing more than two dozen collectors, including contemporary artists making art conceived by collecting, Massimiliano Gioni, the museum\u2019s artistic director, and his team of curators have mounted a remarkable series of object lessons about what it means to \u201ckeep,\u201d the relationship of possession to loss, the madness inherent in love, and the undeniable importance of the individual\u2019s voice in recording and interpreting history and its sweep. \u201cThe Keeper\u201d is its own cultural crowdsourcing, including Korbinian Aigner\u2019s   still lifes of fruit, painted by Mr. Aigner, a German Catholic priest, while interred in the Dachau concentration camp, where he cultivated apples until his escape. Also on view are 3, 000 photographs of people with their teddy bears, assembled by Ydessa Hendeles, a contemporary Canadian artist. Mr. Aigner\u2019s pomological studies were most likely an act of survival, focusing on the reassuring rationality of   during the irrational decimation by the Reich. And, like much of \u201cThe Keeper,\u201d Ms. Hendeles\u2019s \u201cPartners (The Teddy Bear Project)\u201d is a kind of unexpected infiltration into ordinary lives, a backstage look at the familiar spectacle of the 20th century as we think we know it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to flatten it by saying it\u2019s a show about collections,\u201d Mr. Gioni said, sitting in the museum recently, concerned that many people associate objects with \u201cluxury objects,\u201d especially in the art world. Mr. Gioni explained that part of his intention for \u201cThe Keeper\u201d was to look at ways of collecting and owning things. \u201cIt\u2019s not the economic value that makes the value of the object,\u201d he said. \u201cNotions of values are more complicated than keeping score at auction. \u201d There are no masterpieces in the exhibition, as one would expect of a major museum show. \u201cThere\u2019s no hierarchy,\u201d Lisa Phillips, the New Museum\u2019s director, said. \u201cEach has its integrity as a project. \u201d Yet every piece is a masterwork in its right. The exhibition includes the photographed interiors of \u201cSociological Record\u201d by Zofia Rydet. In 1978, at 67, she took up photography with the purpose of documenting every household in Poland, as a way to reveal people through the things they lived with. Harry Smith, an American filmmaker and ethnomusicologist, collected string figures, also in the show, made by indigenous peoples around the world. In an interview in 1969, Mr. Smith said, \u201cAs far as I know, the string figures are the only universal thing other than singing. \u201d By design, there are no distinctions between \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cprofessional\u201d art, either. Carol Bove\u2019s sculptures and her collaborative installations with the work of Carlo Scarpa, the Italian architect, are well known to the   gallery world. Arthur Bispo do Ros\u00e1rio\u2019s tapestries and garments, constructed from discarded clothing and junk in preparation for Judgment Day, are the products of five decades of residency in a psychiatric hospital in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cEvery good artist is some sort of an outsider,\u201d Mr. Gioni said. Every collector is some sort of outsider, too, looking in, trying to understand the experience of being here. Ultimately, even what we choose not to keep defines us. The declutter gurus, yard sales and online exchanges  \u2014   the arcades of unwanted waste  \u2014   are powerful cultural forces, too. Why do we keep? Beyond preservation  \u2014   insuring the safety of a thing  \u2014   keeping can be an act of  . \u201cIt is about what brings us together as people,\u201d said Ms. Hendeles, who archived images of people posing with teddy bears. Her intention was to create a portrait of the century, much like the photographer August Sander\u2019s documentary project \u201cFace of Our Time\u201d in 1929. The cuddly teddy bear, sometimes ratty with affection, turned out to be an icon of the first order, appearing like a totemic ghost in thousands of images. In one, a Nazi wearing an arm sling holds a bear on his knee. Another shows children who later died in the Holocaust. The toys were considered totems of protection and sympathy in grief, such as the black bear produced in 1912 to memorialize the Titanic\u2019s victims. Ms. Hendeles\u2019s project is displayed in a   architectural setting meant to resemble an academic library with steel mezzanines and polished wood vitrines. \u201cIt questions the authority of the museum, the past, and what we think we know,\u201d she said, an intention shared by Mr. Gioni\u2019s show. Ms. Hendeles is the only child of two survivors of Auschwitz. \u201cI was touching on unconscious needs that I had, because I didn\u2019t have any family photographs,\u201d she said of the genesis of the project. \u201cI\u2019m keeping other people\u2019s memories. \u201d One might call \u201cPartners\u201d a family album of man. We keep to tell, too. In a small pocket of the exhibition are objects from the National Museum of Beirut, rescued by Maurice Chehab, its director general of antiquities until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. Mr. Chehab saved artifacts by encasing them in concrete. But as the surviving objects bear witness, preservation can be a sadly poetic concept. They are disfigured and transformed by conflict, melted by hate. Shinro Ohtake\u2019s scrapbooks are more recent records. Mr. Ohtake, an artist and musician, began in 1977 a series of   assemblages that gather the urban residue of his own daily life: clippings from magazines, matchbooks, ticket stubs  \u2014   the cheeky garbage of an active mind. In its devotional richness, each of Mr. Ohtake\u2019s books has the quality of a contemporary Book of Hours. In an email, he explained that he thought of them as communicating \u201cthe potential of the streets of the time, as a site where people lived their lives. \u201d Mr. Ohtake, living in London in 1977, moved frequently and wanted a medium of expression, like a diary, that would be easy to carry and work on. \u201cTraveling is like a collage of everyday time,\u201d he wrote. Speaking as a musician  \u2014   Mr. Ohtake has led two   bands  \u2014   he said that he thought \u201cthe most extreme noise is silence. \u201d Objects, then, would be the loudest things you could live with. A video, \u201cThe Last Silent Movie,\u201d by Susan Hiller, provides a lilting, unsettling musical air to the fourth floor of \u201cThe Keeper. \u201d Ms. Hiller, an anthropologist who became an artist, compiled audio samples of endangered and extinct languages, playing them in a video on a black screen with transcribed subtitles. The singsong and staccato of the work gives voice to the recognition that collecting can be a requiem. More optimistically in the same exhibition space is a thoughtful conversation: Ms. Bove\u2019s installation of sculptures with works by Mr. Scarpa, known for his modern redesigns of museums. \u201cWhen I first saw his work, I felt shocked  \u2014   the strategies that he produced for historical work,\u201d Ms. Bove said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s counter to our traditions of museum design, to be neutral. \u201d Ms. Bove created spatial juxtapositions and interactions that gave the group an intelligent integrity that is a hallmark of a collection greater than the sum of its parts. By its nature, collecting is subjective, even at its most encyclopedic. When collecting strives to become objective, the eccentricity veers into obsession. Oliver Croy, an Austrian artist who discovered 387 homemade building models in a    shop in Vienna in 1993, bought them, lived with them in a    apartment for several years and is no longer collecting, having skirted its edges. \u201cI did therapy, so I gave up on that,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. The models, built in the 1950s and \u201960s by an insurance clerk, Peter Fritz, were given to the Wien Museum in Vienna. In another project, a keeper and the subject of his collection have forged a bond, with a rare   on each end. For 62 years, Ye Jinglu sat for an annual studio portrait, the first in 1901. The photographs, shifting imperceptibly in background, costume and the   register of Mr. Ye\u2019s advancing age, are a virtuosic portrait of a man\u2019s life. In the last photograph, the   dandy of the initial one has softly disappeared, and the world has irrevocably changed. The collection was discovered by Tong Bingxue, a photography collector, in 2007. In his mind, Mr. Tong chased Mr. Ye back into the past. \u201cI repeatedly perused the album,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cthe man patiently telling me his stories by his appearance. \u201d Mr. Tong contacted anyone who might have known Mr. Ye, including immediate family. \u201cI leafed gingerly through the album again, the leaps from the Qing dynasty, to the Republic of China, and then, to the new China. \u201d As he contemplated Mr. Ye\u2019s life, he was able to contemplate his own. He called his relationship to this man \u201cuncuttable. \u201d Mr. Gioni, the curator, writes in his catalog essay that the desperate need to be extraordinary lies \u201cat the root of human nature. \u201d Most overtly it lies within the heart of collectors. But he concludes with the realization, \u201charsh and comforting,\u201d that we are, in fact, just like everybody else. One of Mr. Gioni\u2019s keepers might not agree. Wilson Bentley, born to a family of farmers in Vermont in 1865, was fascinated from childhood by the weather. He attached a microscope to a bellows camera and captured on film the intricate pattern of a single snowflake. As is now generally undisputed, each is unique. And so perhaps, as collectors  \u2014   despite all that we \u201cshare\u201d  \u2014   are we all.'"}, "time": 1742562236.107244}
