Victims were surrounded, punched and kicked. Wallets and phones were stolen. Rocks were thrown at passing cars. When cops showed up, one was knocked from her bike and a police horse was even punched twice in the muzzle. \\nMost of the assaults took place on Friday. On Saturday, Joe Lauletta, a father of one victim, reported on FaceBook : \\nI spent last night in the ER at St. Mary\u2019s HospitaI. I received a call from my daughter Christina after my son\u2019s football game. She was crying, I couldn\u2019t understand her, my heart dropped, I became scared, I said \u201cwhat is the matter?\u201d \u201cDad, I was jumped, I\u2019m beat up pretty bad. Where r u? Temple, they stole my phone. We\u2019re heading to the police station.\u201d I do not hear from her until she gets to her apartment. Rage is running through my mind the whole time. She said she is getting a ride home and wants to go to St. Mary\u2019s. I find out that her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 30\u201340 black teenagers on their way home from the Temple football game. This happened after they got off the subway at Broad and Cecil B Moore. These sick animals held her down and kicked and stomped on her repeatedly. Thank god, the people from the pizza place intervened. They arrested 2 people at the scene. I have not let Christina out of my sight, she is resting. Every part of her body is badly bruised, it makes me cry just thinking about it. No broken bones. If you have children at Temple, tell them to be careful. Please keep Christina Lauletta in your thoughts. \\nCBS Philadelphia describes another victim\u2019s ordeal: \\nZaria Estes , was given a 2 \u00bd-6 year sentence. \\ncatch and wreck , knock out game or flash mob, and it can happen at parks, shopping malls, state fairs or even your living room. \\nbeating . Had these girls not posted their exhilarating workout on Facebook, they might never have been caught. \\nexplains : \\nreading programs in place, tutored high schoolers and even talked to their own students about respecting longtime community residents. But Temple would be wise to reach out into the community with an eye toward creating stronger relationships and greater opportunities for the young people who\u2019ve been pushed aside by a generation of exclusionary development. \\nThe community would be wise to reach back. \\nSo these attackers are among \u201cpeople who\u2019ve been pushed aside by a generation of exclusionary development.\u201d Like many urban universities, Temple is surrounded by black ghettos , but these are being gentrified thanks to a steady influx of white suburbanites and immigrants. \\nIf you\u2019re barely treading water, and your rent jacks up because of gentrification, you\u2019ll be pissed too. Who wants to be evicted? Blacks, though, are always the victims, and never agents, of any neighborhood\u2019s improvement. Why is that? \\nIn Detroit, a post-apocalypse ghetto of burnt out houses, gutted factories and urban raccoons, Mexicans revived a section near downtown. Unlike the rest of Detroit, there are plenty of restaurants and shops in Mexicantown, and it\u2019s perfectly safe to walk around. \\nIf there were fewer Mexicans, blacks would have more jobs, obviously, so why are our borders wide open? In \u201c Race and Crime in America,\u201d Ron Unz suggests that Hispanics are being imported to replace blacks. They can do the same jobs, sans mayhem. In 1992, East Palo Alto had the highest murder rate in all of America. Then a transformation happened as Hispanics flooded in. Ron Unz: \\nOver the last twenty years, the homicide rate in that small city dropped by 85%, with similar huge declines in other crime categories as well, thereby transforming a miserable ghetto into a pleasant working-class community, now featuring new office complexes, luxury hotels, and large regional shopping centers. Multi-billionaire Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife recently purchased a large $9 million home just a few hundred feet from the East Palo Alto border, a decision that would have been unthinkable during the early 1990s. \\nThe more blacks there are in a neighborhood, the more crimes, the lower the housing values and the more dysfunctional the public schools, and everyone knows this, including, say, a fresh-off-the-boat immigrant from Mali or Bangladesh. Black maladaptation is only getting worse. \\nWhat you have, then, is a group that will largely be excluded from better jobs, universities and housing. As long as the United States shall last, blacks will be an underclass. Their symbolic successes, as in having a half-black president, can\u2019t gloss over the fact that the majority of them are barely afloat. \\nThe in-state tuition for Temple University is $15,688, and the school accepts 56% of its applicants. It\u2019s reasonably priced and easy to get in. Only 13.1% of Temple students are black, however, in a city with 44.1% blacks. Before you charge racism, do consider what Walter Williams has to say : \\nAmong high-school students who graduated in 2014 and took the ACT college readiness exam, here\u2019s how various racial/ethnic groups fared when it came to meeting the ACT\u2019s college readiness benchmarks in at least three of the four subjects: Asians, 57 percent; whites, 49 percent; Hispanics, 23 percent; and blacks, 11 percent. However, the college rates of enrollment of these groups were: Asians, 80 percent; whites, 69 percent; Hispanics, 60 percent; and blacks, 57 percent. \\nThough all races are being admitted to college too liberally, blacks benefit the most, for only 1/5th of blacks in universities should even be there. Feeling out of place, blacks across the country are demanding separate dormitories. \\nBlacks are also given preferred treatment when it comes to government jobs and contracts, so the academy, state and media are all in their favor, yet their failures have only increased. \\nIn Ethnic America, Thomas Sowell observes, \u201cThe [black] race as a whole has moved from a position of utter destitution\u2014in money, knowledge, and rights\u2014to a place alongside other groups emerging in the great struggles of life. None have had to come from so far back to join their fellow Americans.\u201d \\nHaving achieved not just civic equality but, at times, even favored treatment, blacks still often find themselves on the losing end of life\u2019s struggles. If you dare to suggest that individual blacks should bear at least some responsibilities for their failures, however, you will be branded a racist. \\nSo I\u2019m a racist for writing this, Walter Williams is a racist for pointing out that most blacks attending college shouldn\u2019t be there, and Joe Lauletta is a racist for calling his daughter\u2019s attackers \u201csick animals.\u201d Everyone is a racist except those 150+ blacks who attacked whites unprovoked. \\nTo many black apologists, blacks can\u2019t be guilty of anything, be it murder, rape, a brick across your face or even racism, because everything they do is just a response to relentless white racism. I\u2019ll insist, though, that these black apologists are the worst racists of all, because to deny someone of moral agency is to reduce him to an animal. \\nAs for the media, their steady suppression or excuse of black misbehavior is an encouragement of even worse. This has to be intentional. They\u2019re enabling more riots, more catch and wrecks, more knock out games. \\nTeaching in Germany, I showed my students the Philadelphia Police Department\u2019s YouTube channel, without comments. One video after another had a black person assaulting or robbing somebody. When a Hispanic criminal suddenly appeared in the 9th video or so, some students couldn\u2019t help but grin, for they were fleetingly spared of the monotony. \\nSince the students wanted to learn about the US, I gave them an authentic, unedited glimpse. At their local cinema, Straight Out of Compton was playing. It\u2019s very cool to act black in Germany . \\nOf course, black apologists will claim that American blacks only rob because they\u2019re oppressed and poor, though I don\u2019t see how this explains the 22,000+ black-on-white rapes/sexual assaults reported yearly, as compared to zero white-on-black sexual attacks. (See table 42 of the Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Victimization in the United States reports for 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 , the last year available.) Oh yes, white women are so fetishized, blacks can\u2019t help but rape them. None of them can help doing anything, I get it. What a gross insult this is to decent blacks. \\nAgain, to deny someone of moral agency is to reduce him to an animal. \\nLinh Dinh is the author of two books of stories, five of poems, and a novel, Love Like Hate .
