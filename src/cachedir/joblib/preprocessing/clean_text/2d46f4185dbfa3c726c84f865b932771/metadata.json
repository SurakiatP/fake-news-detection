S. cities that function as   sanctuary cities.  In that statement, it said sanctuary cities had the \u201cblood of dead of Americans on their hand. \u201d \u201c[S]an Francisco, and cities like it, are putting the   of criminal aliens before the safety of our citizens, and those city officials who authored these policies have the blood of dead Americans on their hands,\u201d the White House statement read, referring to the 2015 Kate Steinle shooting by an illegal immigrant. \u201cThis San Francisco judge\u2019s erroneous ruling is a gift to the criminal gang and cartel element in our country, empowering the worst kind of human trafficking and sex trafficking, and putting thousands of innocent lives at risk. \u201d Also in that statement, White House indicated it would prevail before the Supreme Court in overturning that federal judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d anchor Bill Hemmer asked Spicer on what grounds the White House thought the Supreme Court would side on its side, to which Spicer said the executive order was within the authorities it has been given under U. S. code. \u201cOn the same grounds as the court ruled,\u201d Spicer replied. \u201cIronically, the court agreed with the president\u2019s interpretation of the authorities that he has given under U. S. Code. Where they differed is the interpretation of the intent of it which is outside of what they should be looking at. The U. S. Code makes it clear this president has the full authority to do what\u2019s necessary to protect this country and to present grant money in a way he sees fit. The idea that any judge or any jurisdiction would not be wanting to help make sure that we can protect our citizens runs counter to what we should be looking for as citizens and laws supporting to do. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561934.0508301}
