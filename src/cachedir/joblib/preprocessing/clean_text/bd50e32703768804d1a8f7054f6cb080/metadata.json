It takes even more for the FBI to reopen an investigation of a presidential candidate eleven days before the election. But that\u2019s exactly what has happened. \\nEarly this afternoon it was announced that the FBI was reopening the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s conduct as secretary of state, with regard to her email server and America\u2019s secrets. And don\u2019t listen to any Clinton surrogates who say it\u2019s not a criminal investigation. The FBI doesn\u2019t do any other kind of investigation. \\nThe first inkling of the news was a tweet from Rep. Jason Chaffetz : \\nFBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \\n\u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \\nAbout ten minutes after Chaffetz\u2019s tweet came this letter from FBI Director James Comey to congressional leaders: \\nThe new information didn\u2019t come from WikiLeaks, according to the New York Times ; it came from Hillary Clinton ultra-confidante Huma Abedin (thanks to the sexting scandal investigation involving her estranged husband). Federal law enforcement officials confirmed Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server were discovered after the FBI seized electronic devices belonging to Abedin. \\nWe don\u2019t know when this new criminal investigation will be over, or what exactly the new material is. However, in this highly charged political year less than two weeks before Election Day, Comey would not reopen the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton and do it so publicly unless he thought it was significant. Whether this will have any effect on people\u2019s vote is also unknown. It may be that this kind of news is already baked in to people\u2019s attitudes about Clinton. We shall see. Either way, if you are a Trump supporter, it can\u2019t hurt.'"}, "time": 1742562320.0673969}
