The leaves are dying, nature is preparing for the still of winter and the year is reaching its end. \\nDeath and rebirth is an important cycle that is seen in nature constantly, and it\u2019s also something that is mirrored within us. \\nWe are always going through our own process of shedding, releasing and rebirthing ourselves as we travel along the journey of life. \\nHalloween is a time to honor the deaths that we have all experienced throughout the year. It is a time to make peace with the things that have needed to be let go of and it is a time to celebrate the cycle of the new. \\nFor centuries people have celebrated Halloween and the cycle of death and rebirth. In pagan times, the ritual of Halloween was known as Samhain . \\nSamhain falls on the auspicious day of 1/11 and on the night before the calendar ticks over into November, spiritual activity is at its highest. \\nOne of the reasons that spiritual activity is so high on this night is due to the vibrations of the date 111. If you look at number 1 as a pillar, you can see that there are two pillars on either side with a pillar in the middle. \\nThat middle pillar represents the veil and \u201cbeing stuck\u201d or in limbo between the two worlds. The veil between the living and the dead is also said to be thinnest due to the Sun\u2019s position in the deep and intuitive sign of Scorpio. \\nSamhain is really a celebration of darkness, but not darkness as in evil. It is more about the darkness of the unknown, the subconscious mind and the intuition. It is about the darkness of the unseen worlds and the things that we can\u2019t really make sense of with our rational minds. \\nIn pagan times, important rituals were conducted on Samhain to celebrate death and to understand the darker, hidden realms of life. Through understanding the darkness, the knowledge of light also becomes stronger. \\nThere are many other day\u2019s of the year where the veil between the living and the dead is believed to be thin. These are often days that carry high spiritual significance due to numerology or astrology. Samhain or Halloween is just one of the more common dates in the west. \\nBecause many people also celebrate Halloween, even if it is just through costumes and candy, it can still amplify spirit activity. \\nHalloween is not a night to be feared however. It is a time to give just a little extra thought into the darker things that lurk within. It is a time to give just a little extra thought to any subconscious musings or intuitive hunches. \\nHalloween is also a great time to honor, celebrate and remember loved ones who have crossed over. It is also a powerful time for strengthening your intuition and connection to the Divine. \\nIn 2016, Halloween falls just one day after the potent Scorpio New Moon which is definitely going to be amplifying all of this energy and really allowing us to explore the deeper, darker, hidden realms.'"}, "time": 1742564046.50596}
