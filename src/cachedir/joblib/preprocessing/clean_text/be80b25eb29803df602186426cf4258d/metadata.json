[During a White House briefing on the issue of the   visa, where some 650, 000 foreign workers are in the U. S. at any given moment, specifically mentioned three outsourcing firms that are working to replace Americans with foreign labor: Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Cognizant.  \u201cJust to illustrate a little bit more how the lottery works   \u2014   so some companies oftentimes are called outsourcing firms,\u201d the White House briefing statement reads. \u201cYou may know their names well, but like the top recipients of the   visa are companies like Tata, Infosys, Cognizant  \u2014   they will apply for a very large number of visas, more than they get, by putting extra tickets in the lottery raffle, if you will, and then they\u2019ll get the lion\u2019s share of visas\u201d the statement continues. \u201cWhich is very different than I think how most people think of the   program  \u2014   they imagine it for more  \u2014   being for  \u2014   again, they would think of it as being for skilled domestic work, rather than contract work. \u201d \u201cAnd those three companies are companies that have an average wage for H1B visas between $60, 000 and $65, 000,\u201d the statement read. \u201cBy contrast, the median Silicon Valley software engineer\u2019s wage is probably around $150, 000. \u201d The White House briefing went on to call out the abuses associated with the   visa program, where companies like MassMutual Insurance hires Cognizant to fire hundreds of their American employees to hire cheaper, foreign workers to do their jobs. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve seen some of these   examples where you have career employees at a company who have been working there for 10, 20 years, and then they get laid off and they hire a contracting firm using H1B workers at much less pay,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAnd again, this is an issue that labor unions have called attention to for a long time. \u201d The White House also mentioned that reforms of the   visa and other foreign guest worker visa programs must be accomplished through rulemaking, executive orders, and Congress. Attorney John Miano, who   the   expos\u00e9 Sold Out with Michelle Malkin, told Breitbart Texas that the move by the Trump Administration is a step in the right direction, but said it was not the     to reform. \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction that they\u2019re calling attention to problems in the program. You can\u2019t criticize them for doing that,\u201d Miano said. This year alone, Infosys, Tata Consulting Service, and Cognizant asked for a combined total of almost 44, 000   visas, something Miano says is a misuse of what the program was intended for. \u201cOne of the things is that we have this whole business of importing labor to fill jobs,\u201d Miano told Breitbart Texas. \u201cIf this was supposed to be for jobs that Americans can\u2019t fill, then this whole system of contract labor should not exist in  . A lot of companies are doing this. It\u2019s becoming labor brokerage. \u201d While the Trump Administration issued an executive order demanding a legal review by the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the Labor Department into abuses by   visa program, as Breitbart News reported, Miano says more must be done. \u201cIn reality, you have to tackle them by going through the regulations. They\u2019re hundreds of pages long. It takes an army of lawyers,\u201d Miano said. \u201cThe big problems in this program, the President doesn\u2019t have the power to fix, a lot of this has to be done by Congress. \u201d John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
