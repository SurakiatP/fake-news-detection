[Principle David Frankel sent a note home to parents saying, \u201cStudents were instructed that physical contact including tag games, touch football, etc. were not allowed on the yard. \u201d  Why would this   tradition of playground fun get the axe? According to school district spokesman Daniel Thigpen, things had gotten just a bit too physical. Thigpen explained, \u201cIn this case, kids were getting too rough  \u2026    so the school told them to stop playing those games  \u2026     It\u2019s not uncommon for a school to enact specific recess rules to address specific behavior problems. \u201d Students will face disciplinary action should they not comply. The punishments will begin with a referral, and then a   conference, according to school officials. According to The Daily Mail, the school has claimed that the note was only sent home to some parents, and there\u2019s some confusion over whether the ban applies to all students.   Mallory Giddens is not a fan of the new rule. Giddens told KOVR television, \u201cI don\u2019t really like it. I mean I don\u2019t really play tag but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to everyone else that plays tag!\u201d Giddens continued, \u201cMy principal, he doesn\u2019t want us to have tag at school because people, they touch too hard. Sometimes they push people over and my principal doesn\u2019t want anyone getting hurt. \u201d Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn'"}, "time": 1742561924.399505}
