The photo is held by a Grinnell student wearing a \u201cNational Coming Out Day\u201d pin, and includes a caption stating, \u201cthe misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture.\u201d You just don\u2019t understand this culture\u2026 \\nAnother example of culturally appropriated Halloween costumes, according to the guide, is \u201cusing other cultures as accessories to appear more hip/interesting without adequate understanding or permission ,\u201d one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a Hindu deity being held by an Indian student and the message that such costumes are \u201cdeplorable and problematic.\u201d \\nIt then warns students that if their costumes take \u201cdefining characteristics of another culture\u201d without \u201cpermission , or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture,\u201d then these costumes might be too offensive to wear. \\nThe guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a Halloween costume, asking, \u201cDoes your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke?\u201d as well as \u201cWhy would I find your \u2018Halloween costume\u2019 to be offensive?\u201d \\nCampus Reform reached out to Grinnell for a comment on the matter but did not receive a response in time for publication. \\nTo donate to Campus Reform , go here . \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742562193.308534}
