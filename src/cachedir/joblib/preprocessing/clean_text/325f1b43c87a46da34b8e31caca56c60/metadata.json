It had a national anthem, a national tree, two national animals, two national sports  \u2014   but no national bird. That would not do. The United States has the bald eagle, Mexico the golden eagle, France the rooster. Down in El Salvador they have the   motmot. But Canada, one of the world\u2019s major bird habitats, had gone a century and a half without ever choosing an avian avatar. Why? The Department of Canadian Heritage, the official government keeper of symbols, could not explain it. Neither could ornithologists, nor the editor of Canadian Geographic magazine, Aaron Kylie. So the Royal Canadian Geographic Society, which publishes the magazine and perhaps saw a chance for some nice publicity, took up the   task of selecting one. And boy, did it ruffle feathers. To get the public involved, the society set up a website where Canadians could vote for their favorite bird  \u2014   but it did not promise to heed the result. (Nobody wanted something like the \u201cBoaty McBoatface\u201d online   debacle.) Instead, a panel of experts was given the final say. Prominent Canadian writers championed their favorites in the magazine\u2019s pages, and the contest became a popular topic on (of course) Twitter under the hashtag #CanadaBird. The society even staged a public debate in September, with naturalists and Canada\u2019s poet laureate, George Elliott Clarke, each backing a species. And then came the big reveal. The proposed Canadian national bird would be   \u2026     the gray jay. The what? It\u2019s a fluffy songbird found in all 13 of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories, which is a plus. But it tends to stick to the deep northern woods, and isn\u2019t often seen as far south as the strip of land along the American border where most Canadians live. To them, the gray jay is a stranger. David Bird, a professor emeritus of wildlife biology and an ornithologist at McGill University in Montreal, was the bird\u2019s booster in the debate. In an interview, Professor Bird gave a long list of reasons. For example, he said that instead of migrating, the gray jay stays in Canada and nests through the winter, feeding on frozen food that it stashed away in the fall under the loose bark of spruce trees. Mating pairs are monogamous, he said, unlike many other species. And gray jays like people when they meet them, alighting on their clothing or hands in the hope of a snack. \u201cYou\u2019ve got loyal, you\u2019ve got friendly, you\u2019ve got smart, you\u2019ve got hearty: That\u2019s what Canadians think we are,\u201d Professor Bird said. What you haven\u2019t got is huge popularity. When about 50, 000 people voted in the magazine\u2019s online poll, the gray jay finished third, behind the loon, which adorns Canada\u2019s   coin, and the snowy owl. \u201cI know a lot of Canadians didn\u2019t know what the gray jay was, and were asking: \u2018Do I see it in my feeder? \u2019\u201d Professor Bird said. \u201cAnd there are still people angry because they felt the popular vote was not honored. \u201d Mr. Kylie, the editor of Canadian Geographic, said that the loon and snowy owl were excluded from final consideration because they were already used as symbols by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. He said the relative unfamiliarity of the gray jay, also known as the whiskey jack, weighed on the plus side, not the minus. \u201cWe have an animal symbol, which is the beaver,\u201d he said by way of analogy. \u201cI would say that most Canadians don\u2019t see a beaver in a given year. The fact that some Canadians don\u2019t know this bird, I think, is all the more reason to have it proclaimed the national bird. \u201d Then you have the spelling of the bird\u2019s names. Following the usual Canadian style, it ought to be called the grey jay, with an e, or the whisky jack, without one. The \u201cgray\u201d and \u201cwhiskey\u201d spellings are seen (and resented) as Americanisms. The issue particularly vexes Dan Strickland, who began researching the bird as a graduate student at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in late 1960s and continues to do so even after retiring as chief naturalist at Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario. The spellings, he said, come from the American Ornithologists\u2019 Union, which took it upon itself to determine official names for all the birds in North America. The union gave the species the Latin name Perisoreus canadensis, and at first, from 1886 to 1910, referred to it in English as the Canada jay. The union dropped all English bird names in 1910, but brought them back later, and the current ones stem from a sweeping revision of its naming system in 1957. Mr. Strickland, whose license plate reads GRAY JAY, said that if the government did adopt the bird as a symbol, it ought to legislate a Canadian name for it. \u201cThe bird is obviously a viable, valid contender to be the national bird,\u201d Mr. Strickland said. \u201cBut it is entirely inappropriate for the Canadian national bird to have a name imposed by a   foreign body. The A. O. U. can fall into line for once, or do whatever they want. But they do not get to name our national symbols. \u201d However you spell it, the magazine\u2019s proposal has met with a cool reception from officialdom. \u201cAt this time, the government of Canada is not actively considering proposals to adopt a bird as a national symbol,\u201d   Herbert, the press secretary for M\u00e9lanie Joly, the heritage minister, wrote in an email. Even so, Professor Bird is among those now pushing to get a gray jay bill through Parliament somehow. And he expressed relief that another bird associated with Canada was never a real contender. \u201cCanada goose? Over my dead body,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re basically pooping machines, and they\u2019re obnoxious. If we had picked that bird, we would be getting a lot more outrage than we have now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561635.5983658}
