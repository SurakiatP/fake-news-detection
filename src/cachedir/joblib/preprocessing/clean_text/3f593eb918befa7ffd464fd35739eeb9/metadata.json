[In Two Paths: America Divided or United, Kasich blamed Trump\u2019s electoral win on groups ranging from the media to dishonest politicians, but he also said one of the main reasons Trump won was because of the spiritual decline in America.  \u201cI happen to believe that you can\u2019t guide an entire society without a shared religious foundation,\u201d Kasich wrote. \u201cI saw Trump\u2019s reckless entreaties as a weakening of our shared American values  \u2014   even more so, a coarsening of our shared American values   \u2026     Donald Trump gave the impression of a man who would do or say anything to get attention, even incite a crowd to violence. \u201d Kasich also noted that Trump \u201cgave millions of disenfranchised voters a voice. \u201d \u201cWhat the voters were telling us in this election was that they were angry, that they were feeling that their lives were out of control, that there was a sense of helplessness and hopelessness in the heartland,\u201d Kasich wrote. Kasich announced back in March that he does not believe he will make another run for political office again, surprising many of his supporters. His term as Ohio governor will expire in January 2019.'"}, "time": 1742628572.1592128}
