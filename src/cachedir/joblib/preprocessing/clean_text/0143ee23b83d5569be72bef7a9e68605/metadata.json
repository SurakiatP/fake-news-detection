The American military strike against Syria threatened   relations. President Vladimir Putin said  the airstrike on a Syrian air base, in retaliation for this week\u2019s lethal chemical attack, was \u201ca significant blow\u201d to the relationship. He suspended an agreement to coordinate air operations to avoid accidental conflict. U. S. officials faulted Russia for not enforcing a 2013 agreement to eliminate Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is to meet Mr. Putin in Moscow on Tuesday. The attack was the greatest risk so far of Donald Trump\u2019s young presidency. And at the United Nations, the American ambassador, Nikki Haley, above, warned that the country was prepared to take further action. She provided no legal rationale for the attack. Here\u2019s an   look at the 63 hours between the chemical attack and the American airstrike. _____ 2. The attack in Syria put President Xi Jinping of China, who was meeting with Mr. Trump in Florida, in a tough spot. The action stole the spotlight, and Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Xi to use China\u2019s leverage to curb another rogue government, in North Korea. Mr. Trump repeated his warning that if China did not do more, the United States would act on its own to constrain the belligerent actions of Kim  .. _____ 3. The Senate confirmed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, ending a bitter yearlong standoff over the vacancy created by Antonin Scalia\u2019s death. However rocky the first months of his administration may have been, Mr. Trump now has a lasting legacy: Judge Gorsuch, 49, could serve on the court for 30 years or more. And in our latest roundup of the best political writing from the right and left: How Mr. Trump is like F. D. R. why the left should reject net neutrality, and the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d now at risk. _____ 4. The U. S. economy added only 98, 000 jobs in March, suggesting a cooling of the economy after months of strong job growth. Our economics writer says the new numbers show why the White House shouldn\u2019t be focusing on job growth. _____ 5. A man drove a stolen beer truck into a crowd in a popular shopping district in Stockholm, killing three and injuring 15 people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but officials in Sweden were calling it a terrorist attack. And in London, a    Romanian woman who plunged into the Thames during the attack on the Westminster Bridge died of her injuries. European news outlets reported that her boyfriend had been planning to propose on the day of the attack. _____ 6. Alabama\u2019s governor said he would not resign despite allegations of sexual impropriety and misuse of public funds. Robert Bentley faces a state investigation, impeachment proceedings and, now, the possibility of criminal prosecution. Local headline writers have taken to calling him \u201cthe Love Gov,\u201d over an accusation of an affair. He seemed an extremely unlikely candidate for that epithet when he took office in 2011. _____ 7. South Africa saw its largest protest in years, as people in four cities took to the streets to demand the resignation of President Jacob Zuma. They were united in their message that Mr. Zuma had lost the moral authority to lead the nation. His dismissal of a respected finance minister has intensified concerns about a government culture of corruption and patronage. _____ 8. To affirm Harvard\u2019s commitment to inclusion, university officials are soliciting rewrites of its alma mater. Specifically, the part of the song that calls on students to be heralds of light and bearers of love \u201ctill the stock of the Puritans die. \u201d The contest is open only to members of the Harvard community. _____ 9. The world\u2019s most historic circus will shut down next month, after failing to sufficiently dazzle the children of the smartphone age  \u2014   or overcome the fierce opposition of the animal rights movement. Our photographer Doug Mills captured some stunning images behind the scenes at Ringling Brothers and Barnum  Bailey Circus. _____ 10. Finally, some retro TV fare: Jay Leno returned to \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d and told an Anthony Weiner sex scandal joke and new episodes of \u201cThe Get Down\u201d are now streaming on Netflix. That\u2019s the director Baz Luhrmann\u2019s sprawling take on the Bronx\u2019s nascent 1970s   scene, as seen through the eyes of aspiring D. J. s, rappers and graffiti artists. Also noteworthy: The season finale of \u201cHomeland\u201d will be shown Sunday. See our recap of last week\u2019s episode here.
