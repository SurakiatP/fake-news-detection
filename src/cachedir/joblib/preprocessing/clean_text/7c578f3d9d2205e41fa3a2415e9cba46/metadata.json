But it was the 1970s now. Even good girls had sex. Ms. Silver and the other women writing for \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d made sure of it. [ Read Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s obituary | How she changed fashion ] As Ms. Moore\u2019s new sitcom character, the independent, single career woman Mary Richards, put it in one episode: \u201cI\u2019m hardly innocent. I\u2019ve been around. Well, all right I might not have been around. But I\u2019ve been nearby. \u201d Ms. Silver said there was no particular feminist agenda for the show. There was, however, an   number of female writers on it  \u2014   well over a dozen in the show\u2019s   run that started in 1970. They were encouraged, she said, to write from their own experience, and to let Mary Richards\u2019s   derive \u201corganically. \u201d That made \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d a laboratory for the social issues of the day, which in some cases were being reflected for the first time on   television. Sex, birth control, equal pay, workplace sexism, homosexuality  \u2014   all took a turn on the show, and not from the bully pulpit but from the \u201cgirl\u201d who could turn the world on with her smile. Here\u2019s how they played: When Lou Grant (Ed Asner) interviews Mary Richards for an associate producer job in his Minneapolis TV newsroom, he asks questions that women in the workplace often got asked but that weren\u2019t necessarily legal: How old are you? Are you married? Divorced? What religion are you? She calls him out but answers anyway, in the show\u2019s first episode. The point was not belabored but Mary Richards slept with her boyfriends. A   Chicago journalist had suggested that Mary, who was 30 when the series began, was \u201cundersexed,\u201d Ms. Silver said, and so in Season 3, Ms. Silver wrote an episode in which Mary asked her friend Rhoda if that was the case. A few episodes later, Mary goes on a date and comes home the next morning in the same dress. \u201cMen across the country wrote to the show in despair over the betrayal of their trust and admiration,\u201d Jennifer Keishin Armstrong wrote in her 2013 book, \u201cMary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted: And All the Brilliant Minds That Made \u2018The Mary Tyler Moore Show\u2019 a Classic. \u201d The third season featured another   handled in a    way. Mary\u2019s friend Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) tries to push her brother into Mary\u2019s arms, but the brother (Robert Moore) is more taken with Phyllis\u2019s archnemesis, Rhoda (Valerie Harper). Phyllis works herself into a lather over this development, until Rhoda puts her out of her misery. \u201cHe\u2019s not my type,\u201d she reassures Phyllis, who remains skeptical. No really, Rhoda says. \u201cHe\u2019s gay. \u201d Mr. Moore himself was gay, and he embraced the late decision to out the character this plainly, Ms. Armstrong writes in her book, especially since all the laughs were directed at his clueless TV sister. Had the Pill ever been mentioned in a sitcom script before \u201cMary Tyler Moore\u201d? If so, the moment has been lost to history. Not long after the   episode, Mary\u2019s father, at loose ends after his retirement, is visiting Mary for dinner at her apartment. Mary\u2019s mother, making her exit, turns at the door. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to take your pill!\u201d she calls out. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d father and daughter answer in unison. Cut to the comically guilty look on Mary\u2019s face. The Pill had won federal approval in 1960, but it was only that year, 1972, that a Supreme Court decision had made it available to unmarried women. And Mary was unmarried, for all seven seasons. Early hopes to make her a divorc\u00e9e from the outset were instantly quashed by queasy executives. \u201cIt used to be I felt I could be myself. Now I feel I represent women everywhere. \u201d The third season opens with Mary kvetching to Rhoda as she prepares for a meeting at the TV station, where she resents the station manager \u201ctrotting in groups of people and saying, \u2018This is our woman executive. \u2019\u201d Her views take on a slightly different cast when she discovers that she makes $50 a week less than the man who had her job before her. She confronts Lou, asking him why. \u201cBecause he was a man,\u201d Lou says. \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show\u201d ended just four years before \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d made its premiere, even though it seemed the two shows were worlds apart. Ms. Moore broke ground in the earlier show, too, though. When the script called for her to vacuum in skirt and heels, she put her foot (in ballet flat) down and her Capri pants on. \u201cWe got the absolution of men everywhere,\u201d she told TV Guide a few years ago, \u201cand women kind of breathed a sigh of relief, too, and said: \u2018Hey, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s what we wear. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628589.004543}
