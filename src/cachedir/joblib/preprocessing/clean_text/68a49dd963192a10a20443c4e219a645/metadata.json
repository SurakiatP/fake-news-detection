Dennis Hastert, once among the nation\u2019s most powerful politicians, was sentenced on Wednesday to 15 months in prison for illegally structuring bank transactions in an effort to cover up his sexual abuse of young members of a wrestling team he coached decades ago. In a hearing that was by turns harrowing and revelatory, Mr. Hastert publicly admitted for the first time to abusing his athletes, was confronted in emotional addresses by one of the former wrestlers and the sister of another, and faced a long, scathing rebuke from the judge. Mr. Hastert, 74, who made an unlikely rise from beloved   wrestling coach in Illinois to speaker of the House in Washington, sat slouched in a wheelchair in a federal courtroom here as a judge announced that he was rejecting pleas for probation from Mr. Hastert\u2019s lawyers, as well as prosecutors\u2019 endorsement of a shorter prison stay. While the sentencing hearing was, technically, about a violation of banking rules and regulations, the proceedings focused squarely on the underlying reason for Mr. Hastert\u2019s puzzling bank withdrawals  \u2014   his abuse of young wrestlers who had viewed him as a role model. \u201cThe defendant is a serial child molester,\u201d said Judge Thomas M. Durkin of Federal District Court, as Mr. Hastert sat impassively, often staring downward, hands crossed on his lap. He added, \u201cSome actions can obliterate a lifetime of good works. Nothing is more stunning than having \u2018serial child molester\u2019 and \u2018speaker of the House\u2019 in the same sentence. \u201d Mr. Hastert was not charged with sexual abuse because statutes of limitation for acts in the 1960s and \u201970s have run out the judge noted pointedly that punishment for such a conviction would have been far worse. Illegally structuring bank transactions to keep such abuse secret  \u2014   the felony count to which Mr. Hastert pleaded guilty  \u2014   carried a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Mr. Hastert, whose date to report to prison has yet to be set, was ordered to pay $250, 000 in fines, never to contact his victims and to receive   treatment. \u201cIf there\u2019s a public shaming of the defendant because of the conduct he\u2019s engaged in, so be it,\u201d Judge Durkin said. Mr. Hastert has had a series of illnesses since last year, including a stroke, a blood stream infection and a spinal infection  \u2014   factors his lawyers and family members argued should be taken into account in the sentencing. They urged the judge to consider the entire arc of his life and career, including his years of public service. As Mr. Hastert prepared to address the judge, he used a walker to rise to his feet, but his voice was firm and clear. \u201cThe thing I want to do today is say I\u2019m sorry to those I hurt and misled,\u201d said Mr. Hastert, whose grown sons were in the courtroom. \u201cI want to apologize to the boys I mistreated when I was their coach. What I did was wrong and I regret it. \u201d Mr. Hastert\u2019s remarks followed a tearful, halting statement from one of his victims, Scott Cross, a former wrestler, who had never before spoken publicly about his abuse and who said that he had not even been sure whether he could bring himself to make his statement now. \u201cAs a high school wrestler I looked up to Coach Hastert  \u2014   he was a key figure in my life,\u201d said Mr. Cross, now 53 and a businessman who works in financial services in the Chicago area. From a podium just feet from Mr. Hastert\u2019s wheelchair, Mr. Cross recalled abuse that occurred on a locker room training table when he was 17. \u201cI felt intense pain, shame and guilt,\u201d he said. He said that he had gone years without speaking of what had happened, even to his parents and closest friends. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that what Coach Hastert had done to me was my darkest secret,\u201d Mr. Cross said. The revelation that Mr. Cross was among Mr. Hastert\u2019s victims caused a ripple through Illinois\u2019s Republican Party, where Mr. Hastert had gotten his political start and had been a political mentor to Mr. Cross\u2019s brother, Tom Cross, a former state House Republican leader. Judge Durkin noted that Mr. Hastert had recently unsuccessfully sought a letter of support from Tom Cross. Judge Durkin is the brother of another prominent lawmaker here, Jim Durkin, the Republican leader in the state House, and the judge had offered last year to recuse himself in the case. The sister of another victim, Stephen Reinboldt, spoke directly to Mr. Hastert, describing lonely, isolated years Mr. Reinboldt spent after repeated abuse by Mr. Hastert in high school until his death of AIDS in 1995. \u201cYou took his life, Mr. Hastert,\u201d Jolene Burdge, the sister, said. \u201cNot because he died of AIDS, but because you took his innocence and turned it against him. \u201d At one point, the judge stared down at Mr. Hastert from the bench, and questioned him about the victims, one by one. \u201cYou said you mistreated athletes. Did you sexually abuse Mr. Cross?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t remember doing that, but I accept his statement,\u201d Mr. Hastert replied. \u201cDid you sexually abuse Victim B?\u201d Judge Durkin asked, referring to one of at least two other former wrestlers whose names have not been made public. Mr. Hastert paused. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow about Mr. Reinboldt  \u2014   did you sexually abuse him?\u201d Judge Durkin asked. Mr. Hastert said that was \u201ca different situation,\u201d but eventually acknowledged the abuse. Patrick Collins, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago who has handled corruption cases including that of former Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, said that it was unusual for a judge to veer so far from the sentencing guidelines, which recommended no prison time or up to six months. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary that the case was on its face a    financial structuring case with the conduct acknowledged, but the sentencing was about everything, essentially, but the structuring,\u201d Mr. Collins said. Mr. Hastert\u2019s fall from genial retired House speaker and hometown celebrity was sudden and steep. For decades, both in Washington and in Yorkville, on the edge of Chicago\u2019s western suburbs, where Mr. Hastert had coached the local high school wrestling team to state championship, he had a reputation for appearing    and steady. Mr. Hastert, who had served in the Illinois legislature and was then elected to Congress, found himself catapulted to speaker in 1999, in part because he seemed to be a safe, agreeable option. After leaving Congress, he went on to become a lobbyist. He was charged last May with lying to the F. B. I. and making cash withdrawals in a way devised to hide the fact that he was paying $3. 5 million to a former wrestler for misconduct. The wrestler, whose name has not been revealed and who is identified in documents only as Individual A, told of abuse in a motel room during a wrestling camp trip when he was 14. After the payments began, around 2010, the federal authorities took notice of large, unexplained withdrawals Mr. Hastert was making from his bank. When told that large withdrawals had to be reported, Mr. Hastert began drawing smaller sums, prosecutors say, to avoid notice. The wrestler sued Mr. Hastert this week, saying he still owed him $1. 8 million of their   settlement. Before the hearing, a long list of supporters  \u2014   from Mr. Hastert\u2019s wife, Jean, to Tom DeLay, the former House majority leader  \u2014   had sent letters to Judge Durkin. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve what he is going through,\u201d Mr. DeLay wrote. But for nearly 45 minutes on Wednesday, Judge Durkin held forth in a passionate, often contemptuous tone, with little interruption. He said that Mr. Hastert had \u201cmanipulated\u201d the F. B. I. and the United States attorney\u2019s office, diverted their investigation and knowingly tried to \u201cset up\u201d Individual A, actions that were \u201cintentional, thought out and desperate. \u201d The judge spoke broadly about child sexual abuse and the lifelong damage it inflicts. \u201cCan you imagine the whispers, the   the sideways glances if you\u2019re a    boy and you accuse the town hero of molesting you?\u201d he said. He dismissed the defense\u2019s arguments that Mr. Hastert was too old, frail or ill to be properly taken care of in a federal prison. And he ended with a blunt synopsis. \u201cThis is a horrible case  \u2014   a horrible set of circumstances, horrible for the defendant, horrible for the victims, horrible for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I never have to see a case like this again. Court adjourned. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562714.6401677}
