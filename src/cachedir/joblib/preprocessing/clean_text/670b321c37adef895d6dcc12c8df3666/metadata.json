[First, the news starts leaking or breaking. Newsrooms from the Potomac to the Hudson become seized and fixated on every morsel of the delicious story. News flashes zing around the internet.  Then it hits cable television and the press starts slinging the most salacious and scandalous accusations they can whip up, charging the president with the highest crimes imaginable. Reporters and Democrats alike  \u2014   not to repeat myself  \u2014   are actually now speculating about whether Mr. Trump will survive the certain impeachment hearings to come. But then, as the heavy breathing subsides and the adrenaline rush gives way to factual, concrete reporting, the most damning charges fall away. Turns out Mr. Trump is a germaphobe and wasn\u2019t in that Russian hotel room. The bust of Martin Luther King is still in the Oval Office. He didn\u2019t abandon conservatives by naming his sister to the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump\u2019s Tower  \u2014   and people involved in his campaign  \u2014   were, in fact, surveilled. Slowly, agonizingly, Truth becomes very inconvenient for all these people predicting Mr. Trump\u2019s certain demise. In the end, they are all left clinging to the smallest Styrofoam shard of their original story, bobbing in the harsh sea of Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome. The last remaining wastrels pontificating about the \u201cscandal\u201d formerly larger than Watergate are left with just one flimsy accusation. \u201cWell, he could have handled it better,\u201d they sniff. \u201cHe didn\u2019t follow Washington political protocol. \u201d Are you freaking kidding me? It all starts with charges of high crimes and misdemeanors  \u2014   impeachment imminent  \u2014   and when it all turns out to be fake news these people walk away grumbling about how Mr. Trump could have handled it better? Just look at this latest \u201cWatergate\u201d scandal. The upshot is that Mr. Trump finally fired a man who every single person in all of Washington, except perhaps James B. Comey\u2019s wife, has said at one time or another in the past year should have been fired. Why was he fired? For all the reasons every single person in Washington has stated at one point or another during the past year. But if you are among the legions around here suffering from Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome, it is always much more sinister. Russia! The FBI was closing in on Donald Trump\u2019s sordid connections to the Russians! (Minus the laughably debunked Moscow hotel room scandal that was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s previous \u201cWatergate\u201d scandals.) The FBI had just asked for more money to pursue the   connection, we were breathlessly told. Subpoenas were just being issued to known associates of known associates of President Trump! So incensed by the lies of the scandal\u2019s   it was reported, that a top official in the Justice Department was threatening to quit in protest rather than carry on working for such a criminal in the White House. And then inconvenient reality unfolds again. One by one, each of these blockbusters came under clouds of scrutiny. Nobody quits in protest. By Thursday morning, the whole scandal had substantially come unraveled. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, said he and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, had recently met with Mr. Comey and came away with the clear impression that, in fact, Mr. Trump is not a target of any investigation by the FBI. \u201cSen. Feinstein and I heard nothing that contradicted the president\u2019s statement,\u201d he said. And in a stunning display of nonpartisanship, Mrs. Feinstein agreed. Well, OK. But the White House should have handled it better. \u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes. com follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.'"}, "time": 1742628586.0251777}
