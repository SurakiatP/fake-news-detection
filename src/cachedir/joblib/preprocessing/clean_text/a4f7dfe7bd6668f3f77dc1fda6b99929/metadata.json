The problem has grown more quickly than realized and shows no signs of abating, researchers reported on Monday. Their study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, concludes for the first time that the increase in   newborns has been disproportionately larger in rural areas. The rising rates are due largely to widening use of opioids among pregnant women, the researchers found. From 2004 to 2013, the proportion of newborns born dependent on drugs increased nearly sevenfold in hospitals in rural counties, to 7. 5 per 1, 000 from 1. 2 per 1, 000. By contrast, the uptick among urban infants was nearly fourfold, to 4. 8 per 1, 000 from 1. 4 per 1, 000. \u201cThe problem is accelerating in rural areas to a greater degree than in urban areas,\u201d said Dr. Veeral Tolia, a neonatologist who works at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and was not involved in the new report. Other recent studies have underscored the breadth of the problem. The hospital costs associated with treating addicted newborns rose to $1. 5 billion in 2013, from $732 million in 2009, according to a study in the Journal of Perinatology. Some neonatal intensive care units, called NICUs, now devote 10 percent of their hours to caring for infants who have withdrawal symptoms. Hospitals in the eye of this storm are commonly underresourced, experts said. \u201cTypically, rural hospitals that deliver babies have traditionally focused on the   population in areas they serve,\u201d said Dr. Alison V. Holmes, an associate professor of pediatrics at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. \u201cBut when you\u2019re getting to a point of having a substantial proportion of mothers taking opioids and babies at risk for opioid withdrawal, it becomes a strain on the regional system. \u201d Using data from 2012 and 2013, a recent federal study found states like West Virginia, Maine and Vermont had particularly high rates of what is known as neonatal abstinence syndrome. It includes such symptoms as irritability, breathing problems, seizures and difficulties taking a bottle or being  . In the 1970s, withdrawal symptoms affected mostly babies of   mothers in cities such as Philadelphia and New York, Dr. Tolia said. \u201cWhat this study shows is this has totally flipped,\u201d he added. Babies may be born with symptoms of withdrawal from any number of drugs, including certain antidepressants or barbiturates, after prolonged use by their mothers during pregnancy. But the new report found that rates of infant drug dependency are rising in tandem with maternal opioid use in particular. Doctors frequently prescribe opioids to    to treat back pain or abdominal pain. Nearly 42 percent of pregnant women in Utah on Medicaid were prescribed opioids, and roughly 35 percent in Idaho, a 2014 study found. Maternal opioid use was nearly 70 percent higher in rural counties than urban ones, the new report found. Last year, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that neonatal intensive care units nationwide that used to spend less than 1 percent of their days caring for these infants now must devote 4 percent of their staff hours to the task. Indeed, eight intensive care units reported spending more than 20 percent of their time caring for these vulnerable babies. The strain has prompted a debate about whether the NICU is the best place to treat these infants. A study in Pediatrics found that allowing mother and child to stay together in the same hospital room reduces the amount of drugs babies need, and overall costs, too. \u201cRooming is important for smaller, rural hospitals,\u201d said Dr. Holmes, the first author on the Pediatrics study. \u201cThen they know they can care for these babies without needing a neonatal care unit. \u201d Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist at Vanderbilt Children\u2019s Hospital and an author on the JAMA Pediatrics study, finds the evidence on   convincing. In their intensive care unit, he said, \u201csome of the babies we see are not in drug withdrawal. It\u2019s mom withdrawal. \u201d The study found that rural infants and their mothers were more likely to be poorer and to rely on public insurance like Medicaid, but it did not address other factors behind the increase in babies born dependent on opioids. Women who are already addicted \u201cmay not be getting the help they need before they get pregnant,\u201d said Dr. Nicole Villapiano, a pediatrician at C. S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital at the University of Michigan and the lead author of the new study. They also might have trouble finding medical assistance to treat opioid addiction once pregnant, too, she suggested. For many, the logistics can be difficult. Methadone, a drug commonly used in treatment programs, must be distributed at a clinic every day, which is \u201cvery challenging if you\u2019re talking about a rural community where there isn\u2019t much local health care,\u201d Dr. Tolia said. Pregnant women may also be treated with buprenorphine, available at certain pharmacies. In theory, Dr. Tolia said, it could be more easily distributed to rural areas. \u201cOur solutions need to be focused on where the disease is happening in communities,\u201d he said. Once a baby arrives in a neonatal intensive care unit, \u201cit\u2019s too late. \u201d In July, President Obama signed into law the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. It stipulated that federal officials should give priority to funding programs in rural areas to improve treatment for pregnant women. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time to my knowledge that that population has been recognized as being underserved, and was targeted specifically, and I think it\u2019s real progress,\u201d said Mark Dunn, the director of public policy for the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers. Shame is another reason pregnant women shy away from getting help. \u201cIt affects their ability to come forward for treatment,\u201d said Dr. Anne Johnston, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Vermont, whose program aims to be nonjudgmental in order to \u201cbring people out of the woodwork. \u201d Several experts said that focusing on the babies alone is shortsighted: To stem the rise in infant addiction, they noted, it is critical to treat the mothers\u2019 opioid abuse. \u201cOne has to appreciate that behind every incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is relatively easy to recognize and relatively easy to treat,\u201d Dr. Johnston said, \u201cthere\u2019s a case of a mother dependent on opioids, and that\u2019s complex to treat. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561889.8300025}
