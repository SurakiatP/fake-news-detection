In GHACHAR GHOCHAR (Penguin, $15, paper) a new novella by the Indian writer Vivek Shanbhag, translated from Kannada by Srinath Perur, a family is besieged by both and develops a taste for responding with imaginative cruelty. Sudden wealth only makes them more ruthless. \u201cIt\u2019s true what they say  \u2014   it\u2019s not we who control money, it\u2019s the money that controls us,\u201d the nameless narrator realizes, a little late in the day. \u201cWhen there\u2019s only a little, it behaves meekly when it grows, it becomes brash and has its way with us. Money had swept us up and flung us in the midst of a whirlwind. \u201d This spiny, scary story of moral decline, crisply plotted and no thicker than my thumb, has been heralded as the finest Indian novel in a decade, notable for a book in bhasha, one of India\u2019s vernacular languages. The Great Indian Novel has almost always referred to a particular kind of book: big, baggy, polyphonic and, crucially, written in English  \u2014   \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children,\u201d say, or \u201cThe God of Small Things. \u201d Admirers of this austere little tale, who include Suketu Mehta and Katherine Boo, have compared Shanbhag to Chekhov. Folded into the compressed, densely psychological portrait of this family is a whole universe: a parable of rising India, an indictment of domestic violence, a taxonomy of ants and a sly commentary on translation itself. The title is a nonsense phrase, meaning tangled beyond repair. Our narrator (who, with his excellent intentions and total lack of initiative, recalls Nick Carraway) hears it for the first time on his honeymoon. He has pounced on his new wife, Anita, in their hotel room, but can\u2019t untie the drawstring of her sari\u2019s petticoat. It\u2019s all knotted up  \u2014   ghachar ghochar, she says, reaching for a word from her childhood, a word invented by her little brother to describe a snarled kite string. The narrator is thrilled by this intimacy, to be welcomed into her secret language. In the morning, he gestures at the disheveled bedsheets, their entwined legs: ghachar ghochar. All families are their own countries, with their own idioms, rites and taboos. Anita is not the only character who has grown up within the borders of a particular culture, yet when the narrator tries to share something of his own world, as new lovers will, Anita is understandably less charmed. To survive years of privation, his peculiar family has learned to move as one. The narrator can scarcely extricate himself in his own mind: \u201cWhat can I say of myself that is only about me and not tied up with the others? Wherever I try to start, I quickly run into one of three women . \u2019u2008. \u2019u2008. each more fearsome than the other. \u201d Everyone has a specific role. His uncle runs the family business, a spice packaging company. His fearsome mother and sister fight the family\u2019s battles and keep his father, a   of the business, appeased until he makes a will. The narrator\u2019s job is to stay out of the way, mainly, \u201ckilling time with great dedication. \u201d Anita is repulsed by her new husband\u2019s passivity and the family\u2019s brutal, bullying tactics. \u201cShe would need to have lived through those earlier days with us,\u201d the narrator laments. \u201cWhen the whole family stuck together, walking like a single body across the tightrope of our circumstances. Without that reality behind her, it\u2019s all a matter of empty principle. \u201d Shanbhag is excellent on the inner logic of families, and of language, how even the most innocent phrases come freighted with history. In the book\u2019s funniest set piece, the narrator\u2019s mother tells him she\u2019s cooking him a special breakfast. He recognizes her announcement for what it is  \u2014   a declaration of war  \u2014   and flees the house. His mother has chosen to make this particular dish because the smell of it nauseates Anita. Anita takes the bait, the narrator\u2019s sister is drawn into the quarrel, then his father. The powder keg explodes. \u201cGhachar Ghochar\u201d is one of the first books written in Kannada  \u2014   a language with around 40 million speakers  \u2014   to be published in America. And much about its provenance and its passage into English is distinct  \u2014   it\u2019s the product of a true collaboration between Shanbhag and Perur, a   translator whose interest in this kind of work came not from his closeness to the language but his distance. He felt divorced from his mother tongue, he told me, and hoped translation would help him find his way back. For 18 months, author and translator worked on the   book, taking it apart in Kannada and putting it back together in English  \u2014   lightly editing it here and there, even adding a scene or two. The actual translation wasn\u2019t the tricky part, even though Kannada is a very different language  \u2014   looser, more permissive about repetition. In fact, the translation brought certain elements into sharper focus. To establish the past tense in Kannada requires some elaborate grammatical framing. But English is efficient and allows the action of the book to move as a mind moves, to leap between present and past. If anything, translating the book from Kannada into Indian English (for a version published in India last year) proved less complicated than the subsequent jump from Indian to American English small turns of phrase evocative to the Indian reader  \u2014   \u201cwashing vessels\u201d for washing dishes, \u201ciron box\u201d for iron  \u2014   had to be tweaked. Perur did retain one lovely local detail. The family is accused of using umbrellas to shelter them from moonlight. In the village, where no one can afford umbrellas or knows what they are, the nouveau riche put them to absurd uses. The real work of translation is always in carrying over the unsaid  \u2014   never more important than in a book like \u201cGhachar Ghochar,\u201d where the characters are impelled by forces within themselves, their families and their communities that feel so furtive, even unspeakable. For Perur it was a matter of establishing a voice that could be convincingly savvy and blind. He wrote and rewrote the early pages until he settled on a tone he believed could carry the novel. The book in our hands is elegant, lean, balletic  \u2014   but how can we know if the essence of the original has been communicated? When this question has been put to Vivek Shanbhag, who has himself also worked as a translator, he has recalled one particular passage from the novel. It is, notably, one of the scenes he added specifically for the translation. The narrator\u2019s wife has gone out of town and he is idly rifling through her closet, touching her clothes, her jewelry. He catches scent of her suddenly. He presses his face into her saris to smell more, but the closer he gets, the more the smell retreats. \u201cWhatever fragrance the whole wardrobe had was missing in the individual clothes it held. The more keenly I sought it, the further it receded. A strange mixture of feelings I could not quite grasp  \u2014   love, fear, entitlement, desire, frustration  \u2014   flooded through me until it seemed like I would break. \u201d The essence of a novel, Shanbhag seems to imply, floats like fragrance through the book. It is the emanation of the sum of its parts and cannot be isolated. And perhaps any attempt to single it out is beside the point. Translation isn\u2019t merely an act of transportation, after all, of carrying something over. It\u2019s asymptotic (\u201cthe more keenly I sought it, the further it receded\u201d) a kind of contented yearning and act of ardor every bit as mysterious as the narrator\u2019s efforts to find his beloved among her belongings.'"}, "time": 1742562980.5881991}
