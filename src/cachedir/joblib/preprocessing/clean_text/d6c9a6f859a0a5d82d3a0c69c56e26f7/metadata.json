{"duration": 1.404177188873291, "input_args": {"text": "'CALABAZO, Colombia  \u2014   Skinny but imposing with aviator glasses, a bushy mustache and a toothy smile, Julio Henr\u00edquez Santamar\u00eda was leading a community meeting in this sylvan hamlet when he was abducted by paramilitary thugs, thrown into the back of a Toyota pickup and disappeared forever on Feb. 4, 2001. Ahead of his time, Mr. Henr\u00edquez had been organizing farmers to substitute legal crops like cacao for coca, which the current Colombian government, on the verge of ending a civil war fueled by the narcotics trade, is promoting as an antidrug strategy. But Hern\u00e1n Giraldo Serna, or his men, didn\u2019t like it, or him. From his early days as a   marijuana farmer, Mr. Giraldo had grown into El Patr\u00f3n, a narcotics kingpin and paramilitary commander whose   mission had devolved into a murderous criminal enterprise controlling much of Colombia\u2019s   northern coast. Mr. Henr\u00edquez was hardly his only victim Mr. Giraldo, whose secondary alias was the Drill because of his rapacious appetite for underage girls, had all kinds. But Mr. Henr\u00edquez became the emblematic one, with a family tenacious enough to pursue Mr. Giraldo even after he, along with 13 other paramilitary leaders, was whisked out of Colombia and into the United States on May 13, 2008, to face drug charges. It happened in a    extradition that stunned Colombia, where the men stood accused of atrocities in a transitional justice process that was abruptly interrupted. In the whoosh of a jet, and at the behest of the Colombian president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, the United   war on drugs seized priority over Colombia\u2019s efforts to confront crimes against humanity that had scarred a generation. Victims\u2019 advocates howled that it was like exporting \u201c14 Pinochets. \u201d Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s family, meanwhile, quietly vowed to hold at least one of them accountable for the Colombian blood that stained the cocaine shipped to American shores. \u201cWe hope that the effort we have made over all these years means that things won\u2019t end with impunity,\u201d said his daughter Bela Henr\u00edquez Chac\u00edn, 32, who was 16 when her father was murdered and hopes to speak at Mr. Giraldo\u2019s sentencing in Washington next month. The Henr\u00edquezes will be the first foreign victims ever given a voice in an international drug smuggling case in the United States, experts believe. Whether this recognition is more than symbolic remains to be seen. Mr. Giraldo\u2019s fellow extraditees have received relatively lenient treatment for major drug traffickers who were also designated terrorists responsible for massacres, forced disappearances and the displacement of entire villages, an investigation by The New York Times found. Once the paramilitary Colombians  \u2014   several dozen, all told  \u2014   have completed their American prison terms, they will have served on average seven and a half years, The Times found. The leaders extradited en masse will have served an average of 10 years, at most, for drug conspiracies that involved tons of cocaine. By comparison, federal inmates convicted of crack cocaine trafficking  \u2014   mostly   dealers who sold less than an ounce  \u2014   serve on average just over 12 years in prison. What\u2019s more, for some, there is a special dividend at the end of their incarceration. Though wanted by the Colombian authorities, two have won permission to stay in the United States, and their families have joined them. Three more are seeking the same haven, and still others are expected to follow suit. \u201cIn the days of Pablo Escobar, they used to say they preferred a tomb in Colombia to a prison in the United States,\u201d said Alirio Uribe Mu\u00f1oz, a member of the Colombian Congress. \u201cBut maybe now extradition is a good deal. \u201d For 52 years, with abundant American support, the Colombian government has been locked in a ferocious armed conflict with leftist insurgents. Though it initially empowered paramilitary forces as military proxies, the government withdrew official sanction decades later, long after landowners and cartels had   them. Before their demobilization in the   the militiamen came to rival the guerrillas as drug traffickers and outdo them as human rights abusers. Now, eight years after the paramilitaries were extradited, Colombia has reached a peace deal with their mortal enemies, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (the FARC). Facing an Oct. 2 vote on the accord, the country is in the midst of a polarizing debate about crime and punishment for the FARC, informed by what went wrong during the paramilitary peace process. Nobody is advocating that justice be abdicated to the United States this time. But the paramilitary chapter of the country\u2019s history is not closed, and remains \u201ctotally full of blanks,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Teresa Ronderos, the author of \u201cRecycled Wars,\u201d a   history of Colombian paramilitarism. \u201cNobody knows what happened to those guys. \u201d For years, the Justice Department shrouded the militiamen\u2019s cases in secrecy, not only sealing sensitive documents but also hiding basic information and sometimes even erasing defendants like Mr. Giraldo from the public docket. Using interviews, recently unsealed legal briefs, transcripts of hearings, internal government documents, and information obtained from Colombia and the United States, The Times examined the cases of 40 extradited paramilitary members and associates. Most were handsomely rewarded for pleading guilty and cooperating with the American authorities they were treated as   offenders despite extensive criminal histories in Colombia and they received credit for time served there, even though the official rationale for their extradition was that they were committing crimes in Colombian jails. Take Salvatore Mancuso, who the government said \u201cmay well be one of the most prolific cocaine traffickers ever prosecuted in a United States District Court\u201d and whom Colombian courts found responsible for the death or disappearance of more than 1, 000 people. Under the terms of his plea agreement, he faced 30 years to life in prison. Because of his extensive cooperation, however, prosecutors  \u2014   one of whom characterized Mr. Mancuso in an interview as \u201calways a gentleman to me\u201d  \u2014   asked for just under 22 years. A federal judge sentenced him to 15 years and 10 months. In the end, he will spend little more than 12 years behind bars in the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Roxanna Altholz, the associate director of the International Human Rights Law Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley, who represents the Henr\u00edquezes. \u201cThese individuals are the worst of the worst. They are drug lords and war criminals. Why should they be getting any benefits?\u201d Early on, federal prosecutors addressed Ms. Altholz\u2019s qualms by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put them away it doesn\u2019t matter what for. \u201d But as she and other human rights advocates saw it, it did matter: Crimes against humanity outrank drug crimes, and the United States could have indicted the men for crimes of torture, too  \u2014   or simply given the Colombian transitional justice system a chance. The American authorities think the extraditions served a critical purpose at a historic juncture, \u201cdemonstrating to the Colombian people that there are no such things as untouchables,\u201d as one put it. Eventually, said a Department of Justice spokesman, Peter Carr, the Americans provided the Colombians with \u201cunique and unprecedented\u201d access to imprisoned foreign defendants so that the transitional justice process, called Justice and Peace, could continue. Mr. Giraldo will be the last of the extradited paramilitaries sentenced. Though the United States Marshals Service said it was improbable that The Times would be able to meet with him  \u2014   demanding that permission be obtained from the prisoner, his lawyer, his warden, an assistant United States attorney general and a federal judge  \u2014   a reporter and a photographer did succeed in visiting Mr. Giraldo at a Virginia jail last month. In a baggy blue coverall, El Patr\u00f3n, 68 now, appeared a markedly deflated version of his formerly fearsome self. His hair has grayed, his weight has dropped, his step has slowed. He passes his days weaving purses from   bags and selling them to other inmates for \u201csiete pollos,\u201d seven portions of chicken from the commissary. \u201cLook,\u201d he said proudly, tugging at the shoulder strap of a   bag. \u201cThey are  . \u201d Shortly before midnight on May 12, 2008, Mr. Giraldo was jostled awake in a jail in Barranquilla, instructed to pack a small suitcase and then hustled onto a flight to Bogot\u00e1, the capital. No explanation was offered. Once in Bogot\u00e1, he was handcuffed to waist chains, shackled at the ankles and loaded onto an American government plane with a veritable who\u2019s who of paramilitary heavyweights. They flew in stony silence, furious that Colombia\u2019s   president, with whom they had a \u201cshared ideology,\u201d as Mr. Giraldo put it, had broken his promise not to extradite them. After years of declining to turn over the men, President Uribe had suddenly made an urgent appeal to the Americans: Those wanted paramilitary leaders? Take them. Immediately. He wanted them picked up after the Colombian Supreme Court closed for the day and flown out before the court resumed the next morning, said a United States official who agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Uribe said he feared that the court might block the extraditions if they did not act hurriedly. The Americans snapped into action, though it was a logistical challenge. They needed to \u201cmove the men from four corners of Colombia to one location, then the aircraft needed to go wheels up with all prisoners onboard prior to the court opening for business the next day,\u201d the official said. At one point, the official said, the Drug Enforcement Administration had six aircraft \u201cin play\u201d to ferry the men through Bogot\u00e1 and Guant\u00e1namo, Cuba, to courthouses in Florida, New York, Texas and Washington, D. C. Why did the American government go to such lengths to accommodate a Colombian president who, as it turned out, may have had political motivations of his own? \u201cThe driving policy during the Bush administration was cooperation on   efforts,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Americas division. \u201cNot human rights, not atrocities, not to make victims of crimes against humanity committed by these bastards have a day in court in Colombia. \u201cSo what do you do if overnight you get as a gift from the president of Colombia 14 guys wanted for narcotics? You just welcome them. \u201d This is a crime story tangled up in geopolitics. Colombia is the United States\u2019 closest ally and largest aid recipient in the region, and the partnership has focused on combating narcotics, guerrillas and terrorism. Both the guerrillas and the paramilitary groups funded their activities with drug money, collecting \u201cwar taxes\u201d and providing security for traffickers in their areas. But the drug enforcement authorities focused primarily on the   at first the paramilitaries, while opponents in the war on drugs, were technically on the same side as the Colombian and American governments in the civil war. After 2000, however, when paramilitary troops reportedly committed at least 75 massacres, Washington shifted its perspective. On Sept. 10, 2001, a day before his attention turned elsewhere, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell designated the United   Forces of Colombia, known as the AUC, a foreign terrorist organization, just like the FARC. Drug indictments of key paramilitary leaders followed, and Mr. Uribe, elected in 2002 with a vow to crack down on leftist rebels, used the threat of extradition to motivate the paramilitary leaders to lay down their arms. Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Uribe, whose    toughness made him a popular   president, wholly embraced extradition as a drug   tool. \u201cThe biggest commodities traded between Colombia and the U. S. were coffee, cocaine and \u201d said Robert Feitel, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s lawyer. But for years, Mr. Uribe carved out an exception for the paramilitary men, saying he wanted to give Justice and Peace a chance. The initial Justice and Peace Law was relatively toothless a Times editorial called it the \u201cImpunity for Mass Murderers, Terrorists and Major Cocaine Traffickers Law. \u201d But in 2006, the Colombian Constitutional Court strengthened it, granting victims a central role, increasing the maximum punishment to eight years in prison, and demanding full and truthful confessions. Much to Mr. Uribe\u2019s consternation, the leaders then began confessing not only their war crimes but also their ties to his allies and relatives. The Colombian Supreme Court  \u2014   responsible for investigating lawmakers  \u2014   undertook an aggressive \u201c \u201d inquiry that ensnared many in the president\u2019s coalition. Mr. Uribe fought back, accusing the justices of leftist bias and conspiracies against him. His intelligence agency illegally wiretapped the Supreme Court and individual judges he denied involvement. Then in April 2008, Mario Uribe, the president\u2019s cousin and a former Senate president, was arrested and accused of conspiring with paramilitary death squads. A few weeks later, Colombia woke up to police photos of the paramilitary leaders being boarded onto American planes. \u201cThe whole country was shocked,\u201d said Miguel Samper Strouss, a former vice minister of justice in charge of transitional justice policy. \u201cIt was like they had extradited our chances for knowing the truth and for getting justice and reparation for our victims. \u201d By 2008, the Justice and Peace process, while slow and flawed, had become a real process. Some 200, 000 victims had registered to participate thousands of crimes had been confessed and thousands of hidden graves revealed. Publicly, Mr. Uribe  \u2014   whose representatives did not respond to The Times  \u2014   justified his interruption of this process by claiming that the men had been continuing to run their illegal operations from jail. The commanders themselves, however, firmly believed that Mr. Uribe shipped them out to silence them. And many of their victims\u2019 leading advocates agreed. \u201cThey were, collectively, going to deliver testimony that directly implicated Uribe,\u201d said Senator Iv\u00e1n Cepeda, who founded the influential Movement for Victims of State Crimes. \u201cAfterward, the authorities entered the cells where they had their computers, their USBs, and they took it all. All the work they had been doing, all the proof they were going to present to Justice, disappeared. \u201cThose extraditions marked a before and an after,\u201d Mr. Cepeda continued. \u201cIf the intention really was to achieve silence and impunity, it was obtained to a high degree. Only now, after so many years, are we starting to see results. \u201d At the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Va. the other Colombians used to rise when Mr. Giraldo entered an English language classroom. They would sharpen his pencils and fetch his papers, said Ted Hull, the superintendent. Were it not for that, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s jailers would have had no hint that he was ever a force to be reckoned with. That the senior prisoner who limps from sciatica and speaks with his hands because he never conquered English once ran a paramilitary bloc found responsible for 1, 800 serious human rights violations with over 4, 000 victims  \u2014     they said. Mr. Giraldo is now the type of docile inmate who reflexively crosses his wrists behind his back even when they are not cuffed. Yet here in the territory that Mr. Giraldo controlled, from the bustling market in the port city of Santa Marta up through the Sierra Nevada foothills and back down to the Caribbean coast, he remains the    godfather in the brimmed hat and jaunty scarf whose commanding presence is still palpable. \u201cThis man, from the time he demobilized, left behind armed groups guarding his territory,\u201d said Priscila Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, the security adviser to Santa Marta\u2019s mayor. \u201cWe have not stopped, from 2006 to 2016, having an illegal armed presence in the area. \u201d Now it\u2019s called the Giraldo Clan. Ms. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga spoke in the modular office that she has stationed beside the   marketplace, along with a new police post inside, to signal that the government is wresting control from Mr. Giraldo\u2019s men, who still try to extort an \u201cinoculation\u201d fee for \u201cprotection\u201d in his name. The heavy police presence jumps out at visitors, but in general the region hides its   history, and lurking menace, well. It is nearly impossible to imagine   bodies buried in secret graves beneath this   landscape, where   peaks rise above   beaches dotted with weathered fishing boats as boughs of arborescent ferns dip into rivers with women scrubbing laundry. From the start, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s personal history, pieced together from interviews, court records, government documents and his public confessions, intersected with Colombia\u2019s intense civil conflict. He was born in 1948, the year that kicked off the decade of politically motivated bloodletting known as La Violencia. He did not seem destined for leadership. He had a   education when he left home to become an itinerant farmhand. His lawyer, who likes to turn a phrase, says that even now, Mr. Giraldo remains \u201ca quintessential campesino at heart\u201d  \u2014   \u201cthe kind of guy who wants to get up at the crack of dawn, and draw lines in the hardened earth under a blazing sun. \u201d By the 1970s, Mr. Giraldo was rising early to get in on \u201cla bonanza marimbera\u201d  \u2014   the marijuana boom that preceded the cocaine boom. He organized a mule transport service to gather the marijuana from isolated farms and deliver it to the coast. He was first drawn into violence after his younger brother was killed during a robbery at the Santa Marta market. To avenge the death, Mr. Giraldo contracted a private security group led by a thug called Dracula six men were murdered at the start of a long \u201csocial cleansing\u201d campaign to eliminate \u201cundesirables\u201d  \u2014   thieves, prostitutes, homosexuals, unfaithful women, witches and leftists. After Dracula himself was killed, Mr. Giraldo took over his business, inheriting its subsidiary interest in the nascent cocaine industry controlled by the Medell\u00edn cartel. He transformed the   security group into a ragtag militia when the FARC sought a foothold in his territory and tried three times to assassinate him. His troops trained under an Israeli mercenary, and to practice what they had learned, they slaughtered union workers at banana farms that were supposedly guerrilla strongholds. Mr. Giraldo was arrested as a mastermind of the massacres. That was when he came onto the Americans\u2019 radar, identified in a diplomatic cable as a \u201c  assassin of the Medell\u00edn cartel\u201d whose detention \u201cdemonstrates that Colombian officials are not turning a blind eye to murders committed by the rightists. \u201d Eventually he was convicted and sentenced to 20 years. But by that point, eluding justice, he had exiled himself in the remote Sierra Nevada. From there he ruled his dominion for almost two more decades, protected by a personal security detail of 200 men but also by the elite families that backed him and the rural people dependent on him, the local authorities say. \u201cHe didn\u2019t use a camp per se, like the guerrillas,\u201d Ms. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said. \u201cHis camp was the community because he was part of the community. So the houses were his houses, the farms were his farms. \u201cDespite being, for us, a criminal, he was always seen with much respect  \u2014   and not just respect out of fear, but respect for the order he gave to the area, because there was a great absence of the state there. \u201d When Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s older daughter, Nadiezhda, first met Mr. Giraldo, she encountered an almost benign side of him as a local authority. A young teacher then, she appreciated it when Mr. Giraldo resolved a dispute between her tiny school and the local fishermen storing their gear in the classrooms. She also got a glimpse at his more sinister side, however. She lost her three female students when their mother sent them away to protect them from El Patr\u00f3n. \u201cHe was starting to rape girls,\u201d she said. Like a feudal overlord, Mr. Giraldo exercised \u201ca kind of droit du seigneur\u201d over girls in the region, said a Colombian law enforcement official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media. \u201cPeople brought him their daughters or facilitated his sexual relations with them because it was a way to safeguard their lives  \u2014   if you have ties to the chief, you feel protected,\u201d he said. After Mr. Giraldo laid down his arms, a prosecutor asked him at a public hearing why he was called the Drill. He blushed, but seemed proud of the nickname, observers said. The prosecutor then asked pointedly if it had anything to do with rumors that he liked virgin girls. \u201cThat could be,\u201d he said. Colombian prosecutors began to take a closer look at his relations with girls and women, starting with the mothers of the 24 children he acknowledges. Eventually, they labeled Mr. Giraldo \u201cthe biggest sexual predator of paramilitarism. \u201d In the Justice and Peace process, he accepted responsibility for 35 acts of   violence  \u2014   some committed by his subordinates  \u2014   including the rape of 11 girls under age 14. The prosecutors\u2019 summary of the cases reads like a litany of uninformed consent wrapped inside a pathological dynamic. Victim No. 6: \u201cIt is documented that in the month of October of 2004,\u201d the girl, referred to as Yajanis, visited an aunt who worked at Mr. Giraldo\u2019s ranch. A few months later, \u201che proposed that she be his girlfriend, a proposition that she accepted, and on Dec. 25, 2004, they had their first sexual relations, when Yajanis was barely 13. \u201d He was 56. Based on an analysis of birth certificates, Humanas Colombia, a feminist organization, estimated that at least 13 underage girls bore children who were the \u201cproduct of violent carnal intercourse committed\u201d by Mr. Giraldo. Nine were under 14 when they gave birth. And some victims were probably too young to get pregnant, like the    daughter of one of his cooks. Adriana Benjumea R\u00faa, the director of Humanas, said Mr. Giraldo had bought the child dolls and instructed her, \u2018Never tell your mama, because I will kill her. \u2019\u201d From the moment police inspectors arrived here to investigate the disappearance of Julio Henr\u00edquez, they were stonewalled. \u201cThe law of silence prevailed,\u201d a police report said. Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s wife and older daughter had faced the same fears when they rushed to this village after getting the phone call that he had been abducted. \u201cLeave it alone,\u201d they were told, which infuriated Nadiezhda Henr\u00edquez Chac\u00edn, 42, now a human rights lawyer and a fierce one. \u201cThey will kill me one day, but it won\u2019t be because I was afraid,\u201d she said in an interview in Bogot\u00e1. An ardent environmentalist, her father himself had been fearless, determined to work alongside farmers and fishermen to reclaim the rugged region from the drug trade, she said. On his large property, he was creating a nature preserve, planting indigenous trees and uprooting marijuana and coca planted without his consent. He was not antidrug in a moralistic way, but alarmed by the deforestation caused by coca cultivation, his daughter said. Mr. Giraldo maintained at a hearing in Colombia that he had no direct involvement in Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s disappearance, but that he had instructed his men, \u201cEverything that smells of subversion has to be removed from the area. \u201d And Mr. Henr\u00edquez had belonged to the   guerrilla movement, though he had been granted amnesty 17 years before his abduction. But his new activism  \u2014   he had just formed a nongovernmental organization called Mother Earth  \u2014   was a   threat, an   soldier, Carmelo Sierra, told prosecutors. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious Mr. Hern\u00e1n did not agree with what this man was proposing to the peasants, because he grows coca  \u2014   and because encroaching on his turf was sufficient motive to kill somebody,\u201d Mr. Sierra testified. \u201cThe Mafia does not forgive. \u201d Mr. Sierra said Mr. Giraldo had sent a son, El Grillo (the Cricket) to deliver a warning: Leave town or deal with the consequences. But Mr. Henr\u00edquez did not budge. So seven of Mr. Giraldo\u2019s men were plucked from a morning lineup, instructed to change into civilian clothing, loaded onto a flatbed and sent down the mountain \u201cto disappear the gentleman from the NGO. \u201d \u201cI sincerely do not know what happened to him,\u201d Mr. Sierra testified. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they slit his throat, or chopped him into pieces. I don\u2019t know how he died nor where they buried him. \u201d Eight months later, antidrug agents investigating Mr. Giraldo\u2019s business were murdered along with tourists and a hotel worker at a beachside restaurant. This unleashed a big counternarcotics operation and then a bloody paramilitary power struggle, at the end of which Mr. Giraldo\u2019s \u201cresistance front\u201d suffered a hostile takeover by another warlord, Rodrigo  . In 2004, Mr. Giraldo and Mr.   were indicted in Washington in a conspiracy to manufacture and distribute cocaine bound for the United States. In a superseding indictment the next year, prosecutors said the two men controlled or were involved in the shipment of thousands of kilograms of cocaine that left northern Colombia on \u201c  boats,\u201d rigged with extra motors and fuel. In 2006, Mr. Giraldo and over a thousand of his fighters laid down their arms  \u2014   597 of them along with 73, 400 rounds of ammunition  \u2014   in the paramilitary peace process. The next year, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s lawyer provided coordinates that ultimately led the authorities to Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s decomposed body in a clandestine grave. Nadiezhda Henr\u00edquez attended the exhumation with her mother. It was a chilling coda to years of hoping against hope. \u201cI never thought we would find him as we found him: in a mountain tomb, so very green, beneath a tree, near streams that turn into rivers, with moss and stone of the Sierra Nevada,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Henr\u00edquez said in a statement filed with the court on Thursday. \u201cWith his two hands tied behind his back and two coups de gr\u00e2ce shots to the head, in clothing that was not his, missing a shoe, missing a foot, missing part of his mouth. Only bones. \u201d Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s family distrusted the Justice and Peace process, and pushed for Mr. Giraldo to be tried in an ordinary criminal court for the forced disappearance. In 2009, after his extradition, he was convicted in absentia, and sentenced to 38\u00bd years in prison and reparations of 1, 000 grams of gold, about $43, 000. By that point, though, he was beyond the reach of Colombian justice. So the Henr\u00edquezes took their fight to America. A few months after Mr. Giraldo arrived in the United States, he was transferred to Northern Neck, whose inmate population was a combustible mix of Mexican drug traffickers, Central American gang leaders, \u201cjihadi terrorists,\u201d and Colombian combatants from both sides who got along fine, Mr. Hull, the superintendent, said. \u201cTo be honest with you  \u2014   I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m pandering or excusing terrorism  \u2014   but both the FARC and the AUC, they were model inmates,\u201d he said. \u201cI got the vibe: \u2018I\u2019m busted, and I\u2019m out.\u2019 Every one of them was cooperating\u201d with prosecutors. None of the paramilitary defendants went to trial. Almost all had private lawyers. Mr. Giraldo said that his family was poor, and that \u201ca friend\u201d was underwriting his American legal costs. Fees could be substantial: A document in Mr.  \u2019s case reveals that he paid his lawyer $390, 000. \u201cThe only people who ever win in the great extradition game are the lawyers,\u201d said Mr. Feitel, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s lawyer. In the men\u2019s defense, their American lawyers highlighted the political backdrop of their crimes, presenting them as freedom fighters whose movement became corrupted by drugs. One defense lawyer, referring to American support for the Colombian military, went so far as to tell a judge that a notorious paramilitary leader named Carlos Jim\u00e9nez Naranjo \u201cwas initially, and we can put it right on the record, financed by our own government. \u201d The authorities, in some instances, did seem to view the men as \u201csubstantively different\u201d from purely   drug lords, as Judge Reggie B. Walton of the United States District Court in Washington put it when he sentenced Mr.   to 16\u00bd years. \u201cHe was engaged in trying to fight an enemy that I think, probably, had that enemy won, it would not have enhanced the quality of life for people in Colombia,\u201d the judge said. \u201cSo, I mean, he was engaged in some activity that had some positive perspectives. \u201d Robert Spelke, a retired federal narcotics prosecutor and the one who called Mr. Mancuso a gentleman, said, \u201cSome of these guys were real thugs, but not that many. \u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes to believe they did what they did. Clearly, they did some nasty things. But, you know, it was a civil war down there. I always wanted to believe that if I was put in the same situation, I would have done things differently. But I don\u2019t know. \u201d Ms. Altholz, who represents the Henr\u00edquezes, said she saw an irony: \u201cBecause these individuals took some kind of role in fighting \u2018the evils of Communism\u2019 embodied in the FARC,\u201d their identity as warlords had become a mitigating rather than aggravating factor in their cases. A Colombian law enforcement official said he had hoped for far stiffer penalties as a   for losing the men to the American justice system. \u201cWe all made many sacrifices to pursue them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey threatened me. They displaced some of my colleagues. They killed several of my friends. We believed that they were going to get punishment more in line with the damage they did  \u2014   at the least sentences greater than 20 years. \u201d In those cases examined by The Times, the sentences that could be determined  \u2014   some remain sealed  \u2014   ranged from probation to just over 30 years. Because \u201ctime served\u201d was easier to ascertain, and because many sentences were reduced to \u201ctime served,\u201d The Times used that as a metric. In exchange for their cooperation, most of the men got sentence reductions  \u2014   sometimes before, sometimes after and sometimes both before and after sentencing. There was one notable exception, as far as The Times could determine. Federal prosecutors in New York declined to allow Diego Murillo Bejarano  \u2014   alias Don Berna  \u2014   to exchange information for benefits. He got 31 years. The one other paramilitary leader who received a sentence over 30 years expects it to be cut by 35 percent to 50 percent because of his cooperation, his lawyers said. In one instance, a senior federal judge in Ocala, Fla. balked at the idea of a second sentence reduction for a paramilitary chief. There reaches a point, said Judge William Terrell Hodges, when any further reduction \u201ctends to denigrate the seriousness of the subject defendant\u2019s criminal behavior and threatens to invite public disrespect for the administration of criminal justice. \u201d When Hebert Veloza Garcia, known as H. H. was sentenced this spring in Manhattan federal court, a prosecutor pronounced him an \u201cextraordinary defendant\u201d  \u2014   \u201cin terms of his very serious criminal conduct, but also in terms of his extraordinary cooperation. \u201d In his case, as in most, it is not possible to ascertain precisely how his cooperation helped the American government because specific information is redacted. But Mr. Veloza, according to Ruben Oliva, his lawyer, gave \u201ca   confession\u201d that laid the groundwork for his own indictment, and \u201chis assistance served to deal severe blows to major drug trafficking organizations as well as the violent and corrupt organizations that exist to both serve and prey upon them. \u201d The American government found Mr. Veloza responsible for trafficking more than 450 kilograms of cocaine. Sentenced to 11\u00bd years, he will be released this fall after seven and a half years behind bars in the United States. Then, despite \u201call of the horrendous things you\u2019ve done in the course of your life,\u201d Judge William H. Pauley III told him, he will \u201cget the chance to hit the restart button. \u201d He hopes to stay in the United States, Mr. Oliva said  \u2014   though he has a Justice and Peace sentence awaiting him in Colombia for 85 crimes including torture and homicide. So far, two paramilitary associates have won haven in the United States on their release from prison: Juan Carlos Sierra, known as El Tuso, who spent five years in American prisons, and Carlos Mario Aguilar, alias Rogelio, who spent about seven. Both men have pending arrest warrants in Colombia, Mr. Sierra\u2019s in connection with a murder, according to the Colombian attorney general\u2019s office. Their families have received political asylum, as has the family of a third paramilitary associate, Mauricio L\u00f3pez Cardona, known as Yiyo, who has also applied to stay. So, too, has Guillermo P\u00e9rez Alzate, a paramilitary leader extradited with Mr. Giraldo and released in June, having served less than half his original sentence. As convicted drug traffickers, these men do not qualify for asylum. Instead, they request a rare form of protection against expulsion under the Convention Against Torture, arguing that they would probably be tortured by their government, now led by President Juan Manuel Santos, a centrist. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting President Santos would be personally lying in wait,\u201d Mr. Oliva said. \u201cBut these guys wouldn\u2019t make it out of the airport. Literally, they\u2019d whack them in the airport. \u201d Mr. Samper, the former justice official, whose father was president of Colombia in the 1990s, called this argument \u201cunbelievable. \u201d \u201cWe have the world\u2019s finest individual protection program, as recognized by the   Human Rights Commission,\u201d he said. As a warlord and a drug lord, Salvatore Mancuso was a bigger player than Mr. Giraldo. He was also, unlike Mr. Giraldo, verbosely apologetic. Once he entered the Colombian transitional justice process, he talked and talked. He even sobbed as he asked forgiveness of his victims. Then he was extradited, and after almost a year went by, he felt compelled to take action \u201cto prevent the stagnation and virtual death\u201d of Justice and Peace. Or so he said in a florid letter to an unlikely pen pal  \u2014   Piedad C\u00f3rdoba, then a Liberal Party senator and a victim of a paramilitary kidnapping. \u201cRespected Senator,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe situation that arose from our extradition has generated a state of helplessness, both for the victims and for us. \u201d In a kind of private truth and reconciliation effort, Ms. C\u00f3rdoba, along with victims\u2019 advocates including Mr. Cepeda, traveled to the United States for jailhouse meetings with Mr. Mancuso  \u2014   prison officials declined to let him be interviewed by The Times  \u2014   and other warlords. Mr. Cepeda said he asked one of them point blank if he knew who had killed his father, a leftist senator murdered in 1994. The paramilitary leader, Don Berna, not only threw out some names but agreed to reveal them to Colombian prosecutors, he said. It took six months to arrange a meeting. \u201cFinally, the stars aligned and we went with a Colombian prosecutor, and somebody from the Department of Justice, and succeeded in obtaining his testimony,\u201d Mr. Cepeda said. \u201cBut that was me. A campesino from C\u00f3rdoba or Antioquia, where there are thousands of victims, would never have been able to go through this exercise. \u201d Colombia\u2019s attorney general and justices joined advocates in complaining to the Obama administration, which had inherited the cases, that their pursuit of justice was being thwarted. As a result, in 2010, the Justice Department created an \u201caccess plan,\u201d promising to make about a dozen key paramilitaries available for   or video interviews  \u2014   if the men were willing. Mr. Carr, spokesman for the Justice Department, said that more than 2, 000 video depositions and interviews with paramilitary leaders had taken place, and that some had been televised to centers in Colombia from which victims could ask questions. Still, even in the cases of those leaders like Mr. Mancuso who participated most actively, these sessions were insufficient, according to a Colombian prosecutor who testified last year in his case. \u201cIn total, we progressed maybe 8 percent of what we have to progress,\u201d said the prosecutor, Giovanni \u00c1lvarez Santoyo. He noted that Mr. Mancuso had been charged in 4, 800 \u201cmatters,\u201d from \u201cmurder to forced disappearances, through forced removals, recruiting of minors, sexual violence, sexual slavery, and related crimes such as kidnapping, terrorism, theft and destruction of protected property. \u201d It is impossible to know how things would have been different if the leaders had not been extradited  \u2014   whether more truth would have been divulged, whether greater or quicker justice would have been done, and whether the paramilitary groups would have been more successfully, or less successfully, dismantled. Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, who led the Supreme Court\u2019s paramilitary corruption investigation, said at a forum in Bogot\u00e1 a few years ago that the   by paramilitary leaders was not impressive before or after the extraditions. \u201cMany of them reduced a good part of their \u2018collaboration,\u2019 as we call their obligation to tell the truth, to relating in a decontextualized manner the murders committed  \u2014   justifying them by portraying their victims as guerrillas dressed in civilian clothing  \u2014   and revealing the locations of graves,\u201d he said. Guaranteeing \u201cnonrepetition\u201d of their atrocities would have required far more  \u2014   \u201crevelations about the sponsors, financiers, promoters, beneficiaries or owners of those criminal structures, which in many cases remain intact,\u201d he said. Over the past decade, 128   members have been sentenced in the Justice and Peace process, out of more than 1, 000 detained, according to the Colombian government. But even as the country prepares to set up another transitional justice system for the FARC, Justice and Peace keeps inching forward. As do the   inquiries: In February, Mr. Uribe\u2019s younger brother, Santiago, was arrested for supposed ties to a death squad, the Twelve Apostles. The former president himself was investigated last year for alleged paramilitary ties, but not charged. Now a senator, he considers investigations of him and his family to be politically motivated. Mr. Uribe is the most virulent critic of his successor\u2019s peace deal with the guerrillas he accuses Mr. Santos of what he himself was accused of in relation to the militias: offering impunity to war criminals. President Santos has said he hopes that one dividend of the peace accord will be a reduction in the drug trafficking that financed the internal armed conflict. Coca cultivation has been soaring in Colombia, with a significant increase over the last couple of years in acreage dedicated to drug crops. Extradition as a panacea has fallen out of favor. Colombia extraditions to the United States were half as frequent in 2015  \u2014   109  \u2014   as the year the paramilitary leaders were sent away. And the new accord, if approved by voters, would guarantee the guerrilla leaders protection against extradition for their drug smuggling  \u2014   with the blessing of the Americans. \u201cIf you want to see that as the U. S.\u2019s contribution to the peace process, you\u2019re welcome to do so,\u201d Kevin Whitaker, the American ambassador to Colombia, told Radio Caracol. This year, two young women cautiously approached the authorities in Santa Marta. They had decided to reveal that they had been victims of Mr. Giraldo\u2019s sexual violence even after he surrendered and pledged to stop committing crimes. When they were under 14, they said, they were taken to Mr. Giraldo for conjugal visits, both in a special detention zone for paramilitary members and later in a jail. So potentially damaging are their allegations that the young women are now in protective custody. \u201cThis year, it fell to me, initially, to protect the two girls who made the denunciations, and we got them out of the area because Giraldo\u2019s sons were going to kill them,\u201d said Ms. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, the Santa Marta security chief. Mr. Giraldo called the allegations \u201clies. \u201d \u201cLots of victims are popping up in Colombia because they give them money,\u201d he said, referring to reparations, which relatively few victims have obtained. If proved, the allegations would be grounds to deny Mr. Giraldo the   alternative sentence he would get under Justice and Peace. He would face spending the rest of his life in a Colombian prison  \u2014   if the United States sent him back. This is an eventuality that the Henr\u00edquezes do not think they can bank on. It took almost eight years for the United States to recognize them as victims of standing in Mr. Giraldo\u2019s American case. Their lawyers took a novel approach in arguing that the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act of 2004 applied to them. They argued that even though Mr. Henr\u00edquez was a foreign victim of a foreign crime, his murder was a consequence of the drug conspiracy to which Mr. Giraldo pleaded guilty. The Justice Department did not agree, and for years did not confer with the Henriquezes about major case decisions or keep them apprised of proceedings. And the Henr\u00edquezes were in the complete dark because the Justice Department had gotten the judge to seal key events and records in the case  \u2014   as well as to seal its motion requesting the sealing. It was not until the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed suit last year that the docket for the case was made public. Although Judge Walton initially denied the Henr\u00edquezes status as victims, he changed his mind after the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia urged him to reconsider. \u201cI think the movants have established their burden of showing that but for the defendant\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy the decedent would not have been killed,\u201d he said at a hearing in March. Mr. Feitel, who considers the Henr\u00edquezes \u201cpesky, phony victims barking at my client\u2019s heels,\u201d was disappointed. From a broader perspective, Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge and an expert on victims\u2019 rights, said international drug smuggling cases were generally treated like victimless crimes. \u201cThis is truly \u201d he said. It could have implications for violent drug lords like Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n  \u2014   El Chapo  \u2014   whose extradition has been approved by Mexico. After the March hearing, Ms. Altholz called Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s daughters from outside the federal courthouse. \u201cGanamos!\u201d she said. \u201cWe won!\u201d The Henr\u00edquez sisters do not like to talk to each other about developments in the case because it dredges up their grief. \u201cWe\u2019re like those little rubber dolls where you push a button and they fall apart,\u201d Bela Henr\u00edquez said. \u201cBut I was happy. \u201d Nadiezhda Henr\u00edquez was more guarded. \u201cThese rights are merely procedural,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has meaning, but it\u2019s pretty limited in terms of what is internationally recognized as victims\u2019 rights: truth, justice and reparation. \u201d In its prosecutions of the Colombian warlords, she said, the American government engaged in \u201cnegotiations over justice, and that is not justice. \u201d It focused on the harm done to the United States, and not on \u201cwhat they did to us. \u201d The Henr\u00edquezes are asking for the maximum penalty for Mr. Giraldo  \u2014   just short of life in prison. At the least, Ms. Henr\u00edquez said, \u201cwe want sufficient time so that this can be dismantled, so that in my land there can be peace. \u201d Whether the paramilitary forces were ever truly dismantled, and what role the extraditions played, have been matters of debate in Colombia. But the illegal armed groups  \u2014   called bacrims, short for criminal bands in Spanish  \u2014   that surged after the militias disbanded are formally considered their successors in the peace accord. In the Santa Marta region, the most recent   of   violence occurred in late 2013. Hundreds of civilians were forced to flee their mountain villages during a bloody confrontation between the Giraldo Clan and a rival group that lasted four months and left hundreds dead. Since then, his relatives have mainly fought one another. \u201cIf Giraldo were here in jail rather than in Virginia, we wouldn\u2019t see the territorial disputes,\u201d Ms. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said. Still, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think Santa Marta is ready for him to return. \u201d Bela Henr\u00edquez, though her American visa is pending, said she looked forward to confronting in a Washington courtroom the man convicted in absentia for her father\u2019s disappearance. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Hern\u00e1n Giraldo will be thinking, but at least he will have to see that the crimes he committed in Colombia have not been forgotten,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will have to recognize that his \u2018business\u2019 cost lives, and not just the lives of one leader or one community. It will affect the families who had to bear the brunt of the violence, yes. But it will also influence the history of our whole country for generations to come. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562843.110485}
