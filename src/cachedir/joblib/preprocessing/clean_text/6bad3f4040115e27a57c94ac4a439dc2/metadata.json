The men exchanged glances. \u201cWe were the only two black people in the area,\u201d Mr. Harris said. San Francisco was once a national beacon of   culture, home to a thriving jazz scene that had so many clubs it was known as the Harlem of the West. But these days, blacks say they take notice when they see another   in affluent and   neighborhoods. The jazz clubs of the Fillmore neighborhood have been replaced with upscale shops. Marcus Books, a cultural anchor of the black community and one of the first bookshops in the nation to focus on   topics, closed in 2014. Other black landmarks that have long since disappeared are commemorated with remembrances embedded in the sidewalk like tombstones to a forgotten culture. The decline has been steady and noticeable. One of seven residents was black in 1970. Today, it is nearly one of 20, with most of the city\u2019s 46, 000 blacks living in public housing. \u201cMy prediction is 10 years from now, we won\u2019t have 20, 000 blacks in this city,\u201d said the Rev. Amos C. Brown, the pastor of Third Baptist Church, a historically black church founded in 1852. While San Francisco residents agree that the loss of black culture is palpable, there is disagreement over what to do about it. City officials say they are trying to retain the remaining black population, largely through expanding and improving public housing, and want to lure more affluent blacks to the city. They are also confronting accusations of racial profiling by the police force, which has spurred protests throughout the city. Yet one of the city\u2019s most prominent   Willie Brown, a former mayor and former speaker of the California State Assembly, said he did not believe the shift could be reversed. There is no point in trying to engineer the city\u2019s ethnic population, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would put a whole lot of time and energy into doing anything,\u201d Mr. Brown said, \u201cexcept making sure there\u2019s equal access and equal opportunity and equal resources. \u201d He called the current mix  \u2014   with whites, Asians and Latinos making up the largest segments of the population  \u2014   a \u201cnew reality. \u201d The reasons for the migration are in large measure economic: Skyrocketing real estate prices fueled by   tech jobs have priced out   residents of all ethnicities. But the exodus was also accelerated by a domino effect of black businesses and families moving away, many of them to Oakland and other cities along the East Bay. When black communities, which were splintered into three areas in San Francisco, lost their barber shops, restaurants and clubs, they lost their centers of gravity, according to Mr. Brown. Black residents moved to places where they felt more \u201ccomfortable socially,\u201d he said. The tech industry, the motor of San Francisco\u2019s economy in recent years, has accelerated the decline. The tech industry skews white and Asian. John William Templeton, a local historian and an advocate for greater black participation in the industry, said it was disappointing that blacks were not more involved in one of America\u2019s most successful industries. Around 1 percent of employees at tech companies in the Bay Area are black, down from 4 percent in 1998, according to Mr. Templeton. The shift was also partly encouraged by what is now recognized as an extensive and misguided city policy of eradicating what was called \u201curban blight. \u201d Thousands of homes in black neighborhoods were razed in the name of redevelopment from the 1950s to the 1970s. Theodore Miller, an aide to Mayor Edwin M. Lee, called it a \u201cterrible undertaking that had catastrophic consequences. \u201d The final draft of a   report, published in January, said redevelopment benefited prominent members of the business community whose \u201creal motivation was the replacement of   \u2018slums\u2019 with   commercial and residential development. \u201d The city is by no means empty of   especially in the business district many blacks commute to work from other cities in the Bay Area. Still, Mr. Harris said he often found that he was the only   in restaurants or at the Commonwealth Club, where he helps organize seminars on science and technology. Frederick E. Jordan, a business leader who talks about the need for a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d to woo more blacks to the city, says \u201cthere are no jobs and no contracts\u201d for blacks. \u201cOur backs are against the sea we\u2019re almost out,\u201d said Mr. Jordan, who owns an engineering firm and is the chairman of the San Francisco African American Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe have to rebuild our   middle class,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the mayor\u2019s aide. The majority of blacks who remain are disproportionally poor, with median incomes for blacks at $27, 000 compared with $89, 000 for whites, a disparity twice as large as the national average. Blacks who remain have been subject to racial profiling by the police, according to the public defender\u2019s office, and a recent report commissioned by the city cited a host of actions by the police against blacks that appear to be discriminatory. The report found that while   make up about 6 percent of the city\u2019s residents, they constituted about 40 percent, 20 of 51, of the victims of   shootings from January 2010 through July 2015. In addition, the study found evidence of racial disparities in the rate of police stops and searches of  . Those racially charged shootings, including of a black man and woman, forced the police chief, Gregory P. Suhr, to resign in May. From the days of the gold rush, San Francisco was a place of opportunity for pioneering blacks, as it was for Jews, Italians, Irish and other ethnic groups. The city\u2019s black population was small until around World War II, when tens of thousands of blacks migrated from the South to work in shipyards and other wartime jobs. The   population increased by nearly 800 percent in the 1940s and reached its peak around 1970, when 13 percent of the city was black. San Francisco also played a role in the civil rights movement. In 1968, black students at what was then San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) held a prolonged strike that led to the creation of the nation\u2019s first black studies program, a campaign chronicled in the recent documentary \u201cAgents of Change. \u201d Mr. Glover, who took part in the protests as a student, said the black exodus from the city made him \u201csad and angry. \u201d The larger question, he said, is whether San Francisco is becoming an enclave for the rich. \u201cIt\u2019s a question about who we are and our responsibility to build our communities,\u201d he said, \u201cand not just based upon who has the ability to pay. \u201d The frustration is keenly felt among those whose neighborhoods have lost their core. Many say they feel like strangers in their own city. \u201cYou get the feeling that people are thinking, \u2018You\u2019re still here? \u2019\u201d said Barbara Gainer, a probation officer and a jazz singer. She lives in the western reaches of the city, a neighborhood that was once predominantly black but now is mostly   a segment that now makes up 34 percent of the city\u2019s population, up from 13 percent in 1970. Ms. Gainer says she is regularly asked if she wants to sell her house her mailbox fills up with solicitations. The inquiries were flattering at first because they reminded her of the value of her property, but now she feels singled out. She remembers one couple in particular who approached her four or five times about selling. She tried to dissuade them. \u201cI said: \u2018Even if I sold you my house and you gave me this big price, why would I do that? Where would I live? \u2019\u201d The reply stunned her: \u201cYou should go to Antioch. That\u2019s where your people go. \u201d Antioch, a city about 50 miles northeast, has a sizable   population. At Mr. Brown\u2019s Third Baptist Church, attendance has been steadily declining on a recent Sunday, around 150 parishioners worshiped in a sanctuary that seats 1, 100. \u201cWe pray that we would never be cut flowers, that we would always have roots,\u201d Mr. Brown told the congregation. Mr. Brown then told the story of hearing a radio program lamenting the looming extinction of a type of butterfly. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t have the basic compassion and common sense to realize that blacks are an endangered species in the city of San Francisco. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564233.5563536}
