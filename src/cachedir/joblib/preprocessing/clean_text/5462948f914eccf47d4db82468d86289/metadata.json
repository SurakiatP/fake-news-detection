[Following the fundraiser, the Associated Press published a short story without a byline that was \u201cgrossly inaccurate,\u201d NHGOP adviser Patrick Hynes told local television outlet  .  \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s counselor Kellyanne Conway has told supporters in New Hampshire they should \u2018just ignore\u2019 his critics and the incessant chatter about the scandals dogging him,\u201d the \u201creporter,\u201d later learned to be Melanie Plenda, wrote for the AP. The report also said about 150 attended, and attendees were \u201clargely friendly\u201d to Conway, but \u201csome people in attendance withheld applause when Conway let loose with snarky comments about Democrat Hillary Clinton. \u201d \u201cThe Associated Press in New Hampshire appears to be engaged in leftwing activism rather than journalism,\u201d Hynes told Breitbart News. \u201cAnd Melanie Plenda is a leftwing activist not a journalist. \u201d \u201cThey conspired to sneak this leftwing activist into an event for which they were not credentialed and deliberately misreported on the attendance and the enthusiasm with which Kellyanne Conway was greeted,\u201d Hynes said. \u201cRepublicans across the country should be aware that the AP cannot be trusted to be fair and balanced,\u201d Hynes said. Breitbart News has obtained a screenshot of Plenda\u2019s Facebook page from Nov. 10, 2016 \u2014  just days after Donald Trump won the presidential election \u2014  that shows her making an explicit call to action against the   Trump administration. \u201cNo more crying from me,\u201d the woman who the AP thought could be a reporter wrote. \u201cNow is the time for action. We need to remember this feeling, the pain in our hearts, the fire in our bellies, because we need it to fight. Not with guns and fists but with protests, with our thoughtful words and reasoned arguments, with factchecking and canvassing for midterm candidates and our votes for the same, for defending and supporting those targeted by our president elect. We need to support the ACLU, we need to run for office, we need to oppose legislation that seeks to hurt and further marginalize, we need to join advocacy groups, we need to not be silent. There are a lot of us \u2014  roughly more than half the country to be exact \u2014  who said Trump\u2019s vision of the future is not what we want our country to be. We are not powerless. We do not need to roll over or go back to sleep. We don\u2019t need to be obstructionist just for the sake, but we do need to peacefully fight for what is right. In that way we will preserve our system of checks and balances and take the teeth out of whatever Trump has planned for the country. Alright. Off I go. \u201d Off she went, to work as a freelance \u201creporter\u201d for the Associated Press \u2014  a once venerable news wire service that now apparently hires leftist activists like Plenda to do their bidding on its platform. Basically everything Plenda wrote in that Facebook post is blatant progressive activism, from recruiting and canvassing specific candidates for office to using media   processes for their political gain to opposing legislation to backing various advocacy groups to calling for support for those \u201ctargeted by\u201d Trump to publicly backing the ACLU and more. Hynes also said a photo of the crowd posted on Facebook by party activist Michael Biundo shows that more than 400 people attended the event. \u201cMembers of the media were not allowed to attend due to a \u2018mutually agreed upon\u2019 decision by The White House and the party,\u201d New Hampshire Republican Chairwoman Jeanie Forrester told  . The AP issued a   statement on the controversy: \u201cA freelancer covering the NHGOP fundraiser for AP was outside the event when she was invited in by a woman who appeared to be a part of the event,\u201d Lauren Easton, director of media relations for The AP, said in an email to  . \u201cAP stands by its reporting. \u201d Plenda\u2019s LinkedIn account shows that she works for mostly liberal news outlets, including National Public Radio, The Daily Beast, Salon. com, and Politico.'"}, "time": 1742628511.049705}
