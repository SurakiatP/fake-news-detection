Yesterday Wikileaks founder Julian Assange cited one of the best: Libya. \\nIn an interview with John Pilger, a noted Australian-born documentary maker and veteran critic of American military adventurism, he commented: \u201cLibya more that anyone else\u2019s war was Hillary Clinton\u2019s war. Barack Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person who was championing it? Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s documented throughout her emails. There\u2019s more than 1,700 emails out of the 33,000 of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails we published just about Libya. \\n\u201cShe perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state as something that she would use to run in the general election for president. So late 2011, there\u2019s an internal document called the \u2018Libya Tick Tock\u2019 that is produced for Hillary Clinton, and\u2026 it\u2019s a chronological description of how Hillary Clinton was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state.\u201d \\nThings did not quite follow the script, however. For a start, U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and several other U.S. citizens were massacred when U.S. facilities in Benghazi were ransacked. The attacks were facilitated by security lapses for which Clinton was forced to take responsibility. \\nObserving that Libya remains to this day ravaged by civil war, Assange added: \u201cAs a result, there [have been] around 40,000 deaths within Libya. Jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in. That led to the European refugee and migrant crisis, because not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people then fleeing Syria, destabilization of other African countries as a result of arms flows.\u201d \\nThe interview, which was made in association with London-based Dartmouth Films and broadcast by RT, ranged widely over Clinton\u2019s vulnerabilities.
