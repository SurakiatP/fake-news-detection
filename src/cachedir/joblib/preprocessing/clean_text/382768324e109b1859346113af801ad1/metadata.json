Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017,  Trump\u2019s assertion that   of State Clinton \u201callowed big Uranium to go to Russia\u201d and Bill Clinton\u2019s   \u201cRussian speech\u201d were allegations first reported by The New York Times (NYT) and based on research from the NYT bestseller Clinton Cash, authored by Breitbart News    Peter Schweizer. The facts found in Clinton Cash, reported by the NYT, and deemed accurate by establishment media reveal how Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State coincided with the influx of tens of millions of dollars from foreign sources into the Clinton Foundation which resulted in favorable actions for Russia\u2019s government. Indeed the Clinton Foundation had received millions in donations from several investors in Uranium One, a   company in which a majority stake was sold to Russia\u2019s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, in a lucrative deal needing approval from Clinton\u2019s State Department and eight other federal agencies. \u201cThe sale gave the Russians control of   of all uranium production capacity in the United States,\u201d The New York Times confirmed.  The \u201cdeal,\u201d as Trump points out, refers to how donations to the Clinton Foundation from executives of   Uranium One had exceeded $145 million, according to the New York Times. In fact, those Clinton Foundation donations from uranium investors spiked just as the deal for Russia\u2019s Rosatom to secure Uranium One was being finalized. A troublesome series of undisclosed donations came from former Uranium One chairman Ian Telfer. Telfer made four foreign donations totaling $2. 35 million to the Clinton Foundation while the uranium deal was being negotiated. However, the Times noted, \u201cthose contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. \u201d \u201cWe made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them,\u201d The Clinton Foundation admitted at the time. But Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to disclose the millions in donations her family foundation received from Teller was a direct violation of the Memorandum of Understanding she signed with the Obama administration promising to disclose all foreign donations during her tenure as Secretary of State. More troubling still, was the $500, 000 speech Bill Clinton delivered in Moscow that was paid for by \u201ca Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin\u201d at the time of the Uranium One deal, the New Yorker confirmed. \u201cWhy was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State?\u201d asks the liberal publication. Trump\u2019s calls for a federal investigation into the Clintons\u2019 Russia ties come amid a partisan push to link the President and his aides to Russian   and collusion during the presidential campaign.
