Trump badly needed to make an impression on women like Nancy Groux in Monday\u2019s presidential debate. She is an undecided Republican who hungers for change in Washington and thinks business experience would be an asset in the Oval Office. In the light of Tuesday morning, it was clear that he had made an impression  \u2014   but not a good one. Waiting here for a dress shop to open, Ms. Groux, 60, said that she thought that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had been \u201cpresidential\u201d in the debate, but that Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, had come across like a \u201cbull in a china closet. \u201d \u201cI truly want to like him,\u201d she said. \u201cI keep looking for something in him. But I can\u2019t have my children grow up and look at him as someone to respect. \u201d The first of three scheduled presidential debates was the talk of suburban West Chester on Tuesday, and there was much to chew over between bites of pastry and sips of coffee on Church Street: Mr. Trump\u2019s demeanor as he loudly talked over Mrs. Clinton and hectored her with interruptions her smirks and grim stares as she looked at Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s intense denunciation of Mr. Trump over his denigration of women, after he questioned her \u201cstamina\u201d in the debate\u2019s final moments. Ms. Groux, who works at a flower shop in West Chester, faulted Mr. Trump for refusing to release his taxes, and for what she called a shallowness on policy that suggested an unwillingness to consult experts. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t listen,\u201d Ms. Groux said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he would just make his own decisions and not listen to anyone else\u2019s  \u2014   and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a way to have a country. \u201d This year, as in past elections, the key to carrying Pennsylvania is expected to be winning the trove of educated voters, especially women, in the counties surrounding Philadelphia. Here in Chester County, Mitt Romney defeated President Obama in 2012 by less than one percentage point Mr. Obama won nearby Bucks County by a margin nearly as close. In several dozen interviews on Tuesday, undecided women here consistently said that Mr. Trump had failed to win them over, and that in several cases he had repelled them. \u201cThe faces he made  \u2014   he rolled his eyes!\u201d said Janet Melton, who bought a cake and doughnuts at Yori\u2019s Bakery, where a blackboard on the sidewalk advertised \u201cPumpkin Everything. \u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t come across as being very professional to me. \u201d Ms. Melton, a registered Republican who manages a team of software engineers, said that if the election were today, Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   whom she, too, called \u201cso much more presidential\u201d  \u2014   would get her vote. That alone was a milestone, she added: \u201cI come from a long line of Republican family members who will turn over in their graves. \u201d Mr. Trump, who was rising in national polls before the debate, has also narrowed the gap in important battleground states. A   poll released Monday showed him running about even with Mrs. Clinton among likely voters in Pennsylvania, a state Democrats regard as a blue wall barricading Mr. Trump\u2019s path to the White House. But even among Republican and independent women who do not support Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s debate performance  \u2014   frequent interjections of \u201cWrong\u201d and a thin command of policy details  \u2014   failed to allay doubts. \u201cI\u2019d rather have almost anybody in there except Hillary,\u201d said Debbie Windle, a    office administrator from Glenmoore. \u201cI didn\u2019t like her last night. I thought she was smug. She thought she was better and was putting him down. \u201cBut I look at Donald Trump, and I think, oh, my God, he\u2019s rough,\u201d she added. \u201cHe could cause us a lot of damage. \u201d Ms. Windle said she was considering not voting. And Diana Martens, 51, of Jeffersonville, a Republican who works at a pharmaceutical company, said she might write in a candidate. \u201cHillary, I\u2019m not a big fan of hers,\u201d she said. But she said many of Mr. Trump\u2019s answers lacked details or substance. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has the experience,\u201d she said. \u201cHis behavior is unpresidential, unkind,  . \u201d Not everyone thought Mr. Trump appeared unprepared for the White House. Barb Haag of West Chester, a retired teacher of the emotionally disturbed, said Mr. Trump\u2019s interruptions did not bother her. \u201cKids interrupt you all the time if they have a point to make,\u201d she said. \u201cHis manner of speaking was thorough, to the point I liked the way he sounded,\u201d said Ms. Haag, 69, who said she was leaning toward voting for Mr. Trump. But others who sounded somewhat sympathetic toward Mr. Trump expressed disappointment at the debate\u2019s outcome. One woman in her 50s, who said she was a registered independent but refused to give her name, took out her phone to display a text message she had sent her husband, she said, at the moment Mr. Trump had lost her: when he dodged responsibility for stoking the   birther movement that questioned whether Mr. Obama was  . \u201cI had hoped he\u2019d be smarter and better prepared,\u201d the text message read. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know that birther thing would come up. He thought he could wing this. \u201d Democrats here expressed great relief, saying they had taken note of Mr. Trump\u2019s rise in the polls and worried that he might unleash one of his trademark   slashing attacks. \u201cI was nervous before the debate because I thought it could have gone much worse,\u201d said Sarah Kelley, a graduate student at Villanova University, in Radnor Township. \u201cI\u2019m feeling kind of proud of Hillary. Every time she gave a smile, kind of a big one, made me feel confident. \u201d But Mr. Trump\u2019s confirmed supporters found reason to cheer, too. \u201cI\u2019m going to go with Donald because he didn\u2019t lose much ground,\u201d said Brian Lance, 30, an accountant, who watched the debate in a sports bar in Rosemont. \u201cI thought Hillary was a little crass. \u201d Midway through the debate, Betsy Gehlot, a Republican watching in the same bar, Gullifty\u2019s, complained that Mr. Trump kept talking over Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019s doing all the talking,\u201d said Ms. Gehlot, who works in a boys\u2019 private school. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of bullying her, I think. \u201d The next morning, Bob and Mary Ann Jann were still digesting the debate over breakfast at  \u2019s Diner in Yardley, Pa. Mr. Jann, a psychologist, said he thought Mrs. Clinton had won \u201chands down. \u201d He pointed to \u201cDonald\u2019s dark view of America, and the fact that he couldn\u2019t control his mouth and couldn\u2019t follow the rules of the debate. \u201d What stuck with Ms. Jann  \u2014   and not out of admiration, either  \u2014   was the way Mr. Trump had answered Mrs. Clinton\u2019s attacks about his having failed to pay vendors to his businesses. \u201cHis way of succeeding in business did not seem to have helped out the people who worked for him,\u201d she said. But nothing in the debate seemed to dismay Republican women more than when Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Trump of disrespecting women. Kim Gray, a Trump supporter, said she had cringed when Mrs. Clinton accused him of calling a former Miss Universe \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d because she gained weight and \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d because she was Latina. \u201cThat is embarrassing,\u201d Ms. Gray, an office manager, said as she parked outside the West Chester post office. \u201cI have a daughter. I have a son who\u2019d never speak like that. \u201d Ms. Gray said she still planned to vote for Mr. Trump, however, because of his business success and his support for law enforcement. \u201cHe had a horrible night,\u201d she acknowledged, dropping her voice and nearly blushing on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf.'"}, "time": 1742563145.3959355}
