The purpose of the crime was to steal a rare first edition of the book, \u201cThe Wind in the Willows.\u201d Danaher argued he killed Greenwood in self-defense, yet it only took two hours to render a unanimous guilty charge. Adrian Greenwood, 42, was found dead after being stabbed 30 times at his Oxford home in April.\\nProsecuting Attorney Oliver Saxby told the court that this was a \u201cbrutal\u201d murder that included stab wounds to the \u201cchest and neck and a deep wound to his back.\u201d There was also evidence of torture and blunt wounds indicating Greenwood had been \u201cstamped on.\u201d The sentence Danaher received for murdering the rare book dealer was life in prison or no less than 34 years. Saxby explained to the court that Danaher stabbed Greenwood until the knife broke, after which he began beating him. Saxby went on to say that Danaher, \u201ccool as you like, he helped himself to that first edition of \u2018The Wind in the Willows,\u2019 and Adrian Greenwood\u2019s phone, and his laptop and his wallet.\u201d\\nThe book is valued at \u00a350,000 but Danaher listed it on eBay for only \u00a32,000 after returning home from murdering Greenwood. Danaher learned that Greenwood was in possession of the book after he tried selling a copy on eBay in August of 2015. Danaher had been planning the crime for some time. He also had a list in an Excel file on his laptop titled \u201cEnterprises\u201d of other wealthy persons who were targets. It included their addresses, the method to be used like \u201cstun gun\u201d and the \u201cexpected take\u201d from each target. Next to Greenwood\u2019s name on the list Danaher wrote \u201cModus: Any!! Expected take: rare books.\u201d\\nSaxby, the prosecutor, told the jury the wealthy targets on Danaher\u2019s list \u201cexudes a sense of resentment. It is almost as if these people who, because of their wealth . . . deserve to be subjected to what he has planned.\u201d The jury was comprised of four women and eight men. The names on the list included Simon Cowel, Kate Moss, Jeffery Archer and others. About two weeks before Danaher\u2019s attack on Greenwood, he tried to break into wealthy businessman Adrian Beecroft\u2019s house pretending to be a delivery man, but Beecroft\u2019s wife believed the man to be suspicious and \u201craised the alarm,\u201d which caused Danaher to flee. He later drafted a letter on his laptop to Mrs. Beecroft demanding 200 bitcoin or about \u00a396,000 for leaving them alone. The letter was never sent.\\nThe sentencing handed down by the Oxford Crown Court for murdering book dealer Greenwood over \u201cWind in the Willows\u201d is perhaps a relief to those who were on his list. The author of the book is Kenneth Grahame and it was published in 1908. \u201cWind in the Willows\u201d is a children\u2019s book known for its \u201cmixture of mysticism, adventure, morality and camaraderie.\u201d Its text is available online for free as part of Project Gutenberg.\\nBy Joel Wickwire\\nSources:\\nBBC News \u2013 Man Guilty of Murdering Adrian Greenwood Over \u201cThe Wind in the Willow\u201d Book\\nThe Guardian \u2013 Alleged Killer of Antiques Deal Had List of Famous Targets, Jury Told\\nThe Las Angeles Times \u2013 British Book Dealer Slain for His First Edition of \u201cThe Wind in the Willows\u201d\\nTop and Feature Image Courtesy of Ken Wilcox\u2019s Flicker Page \u2013 Creative Commons License\\nIn-Line Image Courtesy of Karen Cox\u2019s Flickr Page \u2013 Creative Commons License\\n book'"}, "time": 1742561725.0419073}
