It\u2019s right here \u2013 Jerusalem. God showed me well over a year ago that Donald Trump was \u201cHis man\u201d for the White House for one reason, and one reason only. Because Donald Trump will move the US Embassy to Israel , an act which will declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, that will usher in an amazing time of fulfillment of prophecy on a scale that we have never seen. \u2018I look forward to working with him to advance security, stability and peace in our region,\u2019 Israeli leader Netanyahu said in a statement. He went on: \u2018The ironclad bond between the United States and Israel is rooted in shared values, buttressed by shared interests and driven by a shared destiny. PM Netanyahu Congratulates US President-Elect Donald Trump: \u2018I am confident that president-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights.\u2019 Netanyahu avoided controversial topics in his statement, unlike members of his government. Education Minister Naftali Bennett , who heads the hardline Jewish Home party , said Trump\u2019s victory eradicated the idea of a Palestinian state. He said the unprecedented win was an \u2018opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the centre of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause\u2019. For such a time as this: The day I heard Donald Trump say that he will \u201cmove the US Embassy to Jerusalem as president\u201d, the Lord tapped me on the shoulder and said \u201cpay attention to that guy\u201d. Glad I did. Listen to this 2-hour radio program on how Bible propehcy will likely be fulfilled. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that he hopes \u2018peace will be achieved\u2019 during Trump\u2019s term. Politicians from Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party called for Trump to follow through on his promise to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, in a break with the policies of previous Republican and Democrat administrations.  \""}, "time": 1742562212.5015028}
