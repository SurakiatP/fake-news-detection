All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , \u201cvoting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.\u201d Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. \\nMany officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News \u2026 \\nSeveral schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. \\nThe fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. \\n\u201cIf anybody can sit there and say they don\u2019t think this is a contentious election, then they aren\u2019t paying much attention,\u201d Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. \\nAnd without a doubt, voting locations are \u201csoft targets\u201d that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters \u2026 \\n\u201cThere is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn\u2019t have 15 or 20 years ago,\u201d said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. \u201c What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that\u2019s certainly concerning.\u201d \\nAll it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. \\nLet us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. \\nAnother reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania \u2026 \\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose an election because you know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. \u201cBecause you know what? That\u2019s a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .\u201d \\nAnd of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats\u2026 \\nEarly voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. \\nRepublican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. \\n\u201cI tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cYou could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.\u201d \\nIn addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . \\nWell, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation \u2026 \\nAccording to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. \\nThe McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 \u2013 when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? \\nEither way, it doesn\u2019t look good. \\nAfter everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. \\nBut Democrats don\u2019t like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters\u2026 \\n\u201cIt\u2019s un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,\u201d Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book \u201c Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,\u201d previously told The Christian Science Monitor. \u201cVoting was very, very dangerous. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s suggesting that we\u2019re at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.\u201d \\nWithout a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. \\nBut will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? \\nIf that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed. \\nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .
