Located in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, the tomb has been covered by marble cladding since at least 1555 A.D., and most likely centuries earlier. \\n\u201cThe marble covering of the tomb has been pulled back, and we were surprised by the amount of fill material beneath it,\u201d said Fredrik Hiebert, archaeologist-in-residence at the National Geographic Society, a partner in the restoration project. \u201cIt will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of Christ was laid.\u201d\""}, "time": 1742563130.1142097}
