However, a number of Republicans\u2013including a number of Comey\u2019s own agents\u2013are also rolling their eyes in disgust . Well, on Saturday, another Republican joined that list . And that Republican happens to be a host on Fox News Channel. \\nWhen Jeanine Pirro led off Saturday night\u2019s edition of \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine,\u201d she hiked eyebrows into hairlines by blasting the manner in which Comey and the FBI handled this matter. Watch here. \\nPirro got right to the point in her \u201cOpening Statement\u201d\u2013from where she\u2019s sitting, Comey\u2019s decision to send that letter \u201cboth disgraces and politicizes the FBI\u201d and was the definition of \u201call that is wrong in Washington.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s no secret that Pirro is a staunch Donald Trump supporter. Indeed, she has spent most of the campaign finding ways to attack Hillary\u2013to the point that The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple called her \u201ca key Fox News apologist for Trump.\u201d But Pirro took off her red-tinted blinders long enough to come to the same conclusion as a number of other Republicans\u2013there is no defence for the manner in which this was handled. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Hillary Clinton or anyone else, Comey\u2019s actions violate longstanding Justice Department policy, the directive of the person he works under, the Attorney General\u2013but even more important, the most fundamental rules of fairness and impartiality.\u201d \\nOn paper, unlike the average Fox News host, Pirro knows how investigations are supposed to be conducted. She was a prosecutor in Westchester County, New York\u2013a wealthy suburban county north of New York City, and home to White Plains and Yonkers\u2013for 15 years, a judge for three years, and Westchester County district attorney for 12 years. \\nBut Pirro takes what happened to Hillary personally as well. She recalled that in 2006, when she was the Republican candidate for New York state attorney general, the FBI announced it was investigating her for secretly recording her husband almost a month before the election. Pirro contended that this announcement, like Comey\u2019s announcement about the emails, ran counter to longstanding Justice Department policy against commenting on potentially politically-charged investigations for at least 60 days before an election. \\nThe investigation ultimately went nowhere. However, Pirro argued that \u201cthe adverse publicity\u201d cost her dearly at the polls; she was ultimately routed by future governor Andrew Cuomo. For her, Friday\u2019s announcement brought back memories of how she believed she was treated a decade earlier. \u201cWhat happened to me in 2006 was wrong. And what happened to Hillary Clinton yesterday was equally wrong.\u201d \\nIn the interest of fairness, it\u2019s not likely that the announcement in and of itself cost Pirro the election. New York was swept up in a massive Democratic wave that year, one that saw Eliot Spitzer win the governorship with the second-biggest victory for a statewide race in New York history. \\nNonetheless, Pirro\u2019s point is very well taken\u2013no responsible investigator should make public comments about politically-charged investigations this close to an election, unless there is something absolutely earth-shaking. She reminded her viewers that the DOJ/FBI rule against commenting publicly on politically-charged investigations is in place for a reason\u2013\u201cannouncements so close to elections have an impact,\u201d and the FBI should not even appear to have \u201cits finger on the scales of justice.\u201d \\nLike a judge scolding a lawyer, Pirro then knocked down two of the arguments that have been advanced in favor of Comey writing the letter. She didn\u2019t see anything in his congressional testimony that would have left him with no option short of a public announcement. What about fears of leaks? Well, Pirro said Comey should have collared the committee chairs to whom the letter was addressed and told them, \u201cIf this gets out, I\u2019ll know that you did it.\u201d Pirro left out what may have been the biggest argument of all\u2013at the time, the FBI hadn\u2019t even obtained a warrant for those emails. It finally did so on Sunday night. \\nApparently Pirro anticipated that this wouldn\u2019t go over too well in fair and balanced land; she closed by reverting to the usual GOP talking point that Hillary would be facing charges right now had Comey conducted a real investigation in the first place. It didn\u2019t save her. Most of the commenters on two Facebook posts Pirro made on the matter have argued Comey had no other option. \\nThen again, it\u2019s not entirely surprising. After all, most Fox News viewers don\u2019t think any Democratic president is legitimate in the first place, so apparently they\u2019re perfectly fine with fundamental fairness being thrown out the window. The mere fact that we have to applaud Pirro for having the guts to speak out against Comey\u2019s actions\u2013which, at this point, seem incompetent at best\u2013says a lot about the state of our discourse. And it isn\u2019t good. \\n( featured image courtesy Pirro\u2019s Facebook) About Darrell Lucus \\nDarrell is a 30-something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school.
