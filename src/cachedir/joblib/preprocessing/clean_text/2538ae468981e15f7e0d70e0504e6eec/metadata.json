Normally of placid and amiable temperament, like most retrievers, she was quite happy to be fed regularly, thrown the odd bone and tickled under the tummy every now and then. Even visits to the vet was like a jolly excursion for her. \u201cBut over the last month or so, while we were watching television after dinner, she would start behaving strangely\u201d, observed my cousin, restlessly tugging at his forelock. \\nAs a regular contributor to UnReal Times (URT), my columnist\u2019s bloodhound instincts took over, as I clearly saw the beginnings of a major newsbreak, outside the world of sordid politics, boringly one sided cricket and just plain boring Bollywood. At least, that\u2019s what I figured, when I decided to probe my cousin further on Zoey\u2019s curious antics. Since this relative was reluctant to give out his real name to URT\u2019s massive readership, we\u2019ll just call him VK. Here he is, being interviewed by your intrepid reporter. \\nURT \u2013 \u201cHi VK, tell us more about Zoey and the television. What gives?\u201d \\nVK \u2013 \u201cWell it\u2019s like this. When we put the TV on, the first thing Zoey usually does is lie down and go to sleep. Unfailingly. But in recent times, she has been sitting bolt upright and making a variety of different sounds. I thought of calling my vet, until my wife shushed me and said listen carefully and watch Zoey closely\u201d. \\nURT \u2013 \u201cAnd then what happened? The suspense is killing me\u201d. \\nVK \u2013 \u201cPatience, brother. All will be revealed. It took us a while to detect a pattern, but then things started unraveling. Whenever the Prime Minister came on screen and spoke, Zoey would wag her tail vigorously, joyously yelping the while, leap on to our bed, give us a lick or two and, for all the world, look like she had been offered a huge leg of mutton\u201d. \\nURT \u2013 \u201cWow, that is really weird. What else?\u201d \\nVK \u2013 \u201cWhen Arvind Kejriwal appeared on TV, Zoey would go all still, crouch like a tiger advancing on its prey, and emit a fearful, elongated growl, baring her fangs, prior to barking her head off. And wouldn\u2019t stop barking till Kejriwal was off screen. And when the PM appeared again, it was back to tail wagging and whimpering\u201d. \\nURT \u2013 \u201cThis is scary, man. Is Zoey psychic?\u201d \\nVK \u2013 \u201cWait, you haven\u2019t heard it all. The same hostile body language Zoey exhibited with Kejriwal, she pretty much repeated with RaGa. I tried telling her RaGa is such a sweet, baby faced young chap, but no. It was all a-barking and a-growling. Kejri all over again. Ditto with Akhilesh Yadav and his dad, Sonia Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee. Even the image that went viral, supposedly of one of our ailing political leaders, and turned out to be that of an inert patient from Lima in Peru lying in a coma in her hospital bed for over seven years, could not soothe our Zoey\u201d. \\nURT \u2013 \u201cThis is too good, yaar. And\u2026.?\u201d \\nVK \u2013 \u201cThe moment either Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley or Sambit Patra came on screen, she was back to her happy jumping up and down\u201d. \\nURT \u2013 \u201c Elementary, my dear VK. This can mean only one thing. Our Zoey is a confirmed BJP bhakt. Didn\u2019t you tell me last time that she loves mutton, chicken, pork, fish etc., but shies away from beef?\u201d \\nVK \u2013 \u201cDid I? Now you\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d \\nWhile we were having this discussion in VK\u2019s terrace garden, we heard a blood curdling series of high pitched whinnying and manic barking coming from the TV room. \\nVK \u2013 \u201dLooks like Zoe\u2019s gone nuts. Wonder who\u2019s on TV now?\u201d \\nWe both rushed towards the TV room. To our surprise, we found Zoey cowering under the couch, whimpering in terror, while surprisingly the barking still continued. We turned around looking for the source and found Arnab Goswami on screen shaking his fists and fulminating against those criticizing the Government for surgically striking the enemy. I looked at VK, he looked at me. \\nURT \u2013 \u201cBetter switch off the TV.\u201d \\nVK \u2013 \u201cYeah.
