In our story so far , a cyclops challenged Outis to discover possibly inconvenient truths about liberalism, and proposed the help of three Spirits. Through the gloom, there sounded the deep, hollow, melancholy note of a bell. I turned, and there stood a strange figure. It seemed rather aged, and yet the face, and the smooth, hairless head, had not a wrinkle in it. The arms were very long and muscular, and the feet were bare. \u201cAre you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\u201d I asked. \u201cI am!\u201d He spoke with a French accent, in a voice that was even and clear. \u201cWho and what are you?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI am the Ghost of Liberalism Past. My name is Michel Foucault.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cShould I know that name?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d the Spirit exclaimed, with a flash of pride. Then he sighed. \u201cI suppose,\u201d he said, \u201cit is better if my phantom no longer casts its shadow upon the world, as if I were some sort of great Astrologer surveying an atemporal sky, telling people what is good and what is not.\u201d \u201cBut you were famous?\u201d I asked, feeling bad that I had hurt his feelings. \u201cOh, sure,\u201d he said with a trace of self-mockery. \u201cNoam Chomsky once said that he had \u2018never met anyone who was so totally amoral.\u2019 I tried to teach people about madness, medicine, and sexuality, but most wrote me off as this radical anarchist with an absolute hatred of power.\u201d \u201cAnd that wasn\u2019t true?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cPower is not always repressive.\u201d I struggled to understand. \u201cBy power, do you mean government? Or one social group oppressing another?\u201d \u201cThese are only a few particular instances of power,\u201d Foucault explained. \u201cPower is anything that tends to render immobile and untouchable those things that are offered to us as real, as true, as good.\u201d \u201cThat sounds kind of\u2026 bad,\u201d I replied. \u201cListen, listen,\u201d Foucault replied. \u201cHow difficult it is! I\u2019m not a prophet. I\u2019m not going to tell people, \u201cThis is good for you, this is bad for you!\u201d I try to analyze a real situation in its various complexities, with the goal of allowing refusal, and curiosity, and innovation. Is it clearer, now?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI find your world confusing. It\u2019s like there are no points of orientation\u2026\u201d Foucault gazed at me mildly. \u201cPerhaps, in time\u2026\u201d he murmured. Then he clasped me by the arm. \u201cRise! And walk with me!\u201d I took a step \u2013 and found myself outside a snowy yard covered in red brick. \u201cWhat?\u201d I stammered. \u201cHere is where I wrote my thesis\u2026\u201d \u201cYou remember it, then?\u201d inquired the Spirit. \u201cRemember it?\u201d I cried. \u201cI could walk this campus blindfolded.\u201d \u201cLet us go in, then.\u201d We walked through the doors of the Kennedy School of Government, into the midst of a boisterous crowd of students. Seconds later, they fell silent, and the president of the Young Democrats announced the speaker. It was Al Franken, presenting his book Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot . I hadn\u2019t heard Franken\u2019s name in a while, but something tugged at my memory. I looked questioningly at Foucault. \u201c1996,\u201d was his only response, as laughter echoed from the audience. Franken had begun speaking. I soon found myself nodding along with Franken\u2019s words. Franken pointed out that Limbaugh had \u201ctapped into the resentments of the \u2018angry white male,\u2019\u201d mentioning his \u201cstudio audience of rabid \u2013 but extraordinarily straight-laced \u2013 right-wing yahoos.\u201d He went on to talk about some of the crazy religious people he had met while touring the country. \u201cBy now, you may be thinking I\u2019m showing an anti-Christian bias,\u201d Franken suggested, grinning. \u201cNonsense! Need I remind you that I married a Roman Catholic, whom I met in college, despoiled and then convinced to renounce the Pope?\u201d The crowd roared with laughter. I joined them, although something about that word \u201cdespoiled\u201d rubbed me the wrong way. Franken added that Limbaugh believes feminists think all heterosexual sex is rape. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d Franken said, \u201cI know a lot of women, almost all of whom consider themselves feminists, and I know of only one who actually holds this belief. And we\u2019ve been married nearly twenty years.\u201d As the room rocked with laughter, my jaw dropped. Making light of the victims of marital rape? What was Franken\u2019s problem? Franken said that at one point, when Limbaugh had not been famous, he had been so poor that his wife had made him go file for unemployment. Franken addressed Limbaugh directly. \u201cI swear, you must be the biggest pussy on God\u2019s green Earth. My God, you are a sad, sad creature, aren\u2019t you? Sort of a she-male?\u201d I was sure Franken was right and Limbaugh was a horrible person, but how could he not see how problematic his statements were? Reinforcing gender normativity? Negative references to female anatomy? Why wasn\u2019t anyone in the audience besides me concerned? Most likely people were concerned, but felt too marginalized to say anything. Franken had meanwhile moved on to the big picture. What was the fundamental issue with guys like Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich and Pat Robertson? \u201cYou know what I dislike most about these guys? They\u2019re always so certain. They\u2019re always 100 percent sure of what they\u2019re saying.\u201d He paused for a split second. \u201cThis is why I like being a Democrat. When we see a complicated, intractable problem, we have the only really genuine, authentic human reaction you can have: we\u2019re confused.\u201d I stared at Foucault. When Allan Bloom had claimed that liberals are terrified of people who think they are right, I had assumed he was describing a colony on Neptune. Maybe he was instead talking about people like Franken and Foucault. Foucault smiled back at me. Franken started to discuss various controversial issues. President Clinton\u2019s crime bill paid for a lot of new prisons, and that\u2019s good. Riiight. I have no problem frying a murderer. In some cases I\u2019d even waive the cruel-and-unusual punishment. That is, as long as we know we have the right guy. Right. What kind of progressive/liberal was this guy, anyway? Wait, what was that about a \u201cnational Ponzi scheme currently scheduled to implode in a spectacular fiscal nightmare\u201d? Pete Peterson, a co-founder of the Concord Coalition, did hit a home run with a very sobering speech about what will happen if we don\u2019t reform social security. Okaaay. Franken talked about watching Pat Buchanan speak to members of the Reform Party. He counted six standing ovations, \u201calthough it\u2019s hard to count when you\u2019re cowering under your seat.\u201d The biggest ovations had come on the crowd\u2019s \u201cred meat issues,\u201d such as NAFTA and the 1995 Mexican bank bailout, on which Buchanan had said: Politicians of both parties sold us out in Washington, D.C. They took Citibank and Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs off the hook, and they put us on. Well, [\u2026] when I get to the White House, NAFTA will be canceled! To me, the speech sounded like something Matt Taibbi would say. Why did it frighten Franken so much? An uncomfortable subject that\u2019s not discussed enough is black on black crime. Jesse Jackson had the courage to talk about it in terms that most people can identify with. He said it pains him that when he\u2019s walking down the street at night and hears footsteps, he\u2019s relieved if it\u2019s a white man and not a black man. I know exactly what he means. I was leaving NBC late one night and heard some footsteps. When I turned around, I saw it was Jesse Jackson, and it scared the living daylights out of me! The audience thought this was hysterical. Why hadn\u2019t the real progressives organized to deplatform this guy? Franken returned to the topic of anti-establishment, anti-free trade Americans in his final windup. Some of them were crackpots, sure. But I thought about Hank from Michigan, a retired autoworker who was worried about jobs moving overseas. I thought about Louise from Washington state, who was scared for her children because wages for non-college graduates have fallen 20 percent in the last twenty years. I thought about how our political system appeals to the worst, not the best, in us. And I thought about this book. Maybe, I thought, I\u2019m on the wrong track. Maybe I\u2019m sowing the very seeds of distrust that I so decry. Perhaps, I thought, I should throw away the 200-plus pages of cheap, tawdry, mean-spirited (yet accurate) bile, and start over on a book whose humor heals rather than wounds. Then, as we flew over Manhattan, it occurred to me that my book was due in a week. Then we flew over my daughter\u2019s private school. And then my son\u2019s orthodontist. Followed by the bank that holds the mortgage on my apartment. And as the plane banked its wings, a stream of light pierced the window, bathing my face in the orange glow of the sun setting over the American continent. And I thought to myself, \u201cYou know, Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot.\u201d \u201cHe sells out his principles to maintain his cushy lifestyle and then brags about it?\u201d I wondered incredulously, as laughter and applause reverberated around me. \u201c Allez, viens ,\u201d Foucault said, beckoning. A long line of students waited to talk with Franken, who beamed and autographed copies of his book. A rather earnest-looking young man and woman were walking towards us. \u201cDid you like it, Outis?\u201d she asked with an accent a bit like Foucault\u2019s. \u201cIt was hilarious,\u201d the young man said. \u201cBut Corinne, did you\u2026\u201d \u201cYes, it was good,\u201d she said. \u201cRush Limbaugh really is a negative person and it\u2019s scary that there are so many insane people in your country. But\u2026\u201d \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said the young Outis. \u201cThe talk over in your department\u2026\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019re not thrilled about it,\u201d Corinne began. Outis said, \u201cThe way they talk\u2026\u201d Corinne completed the thought. \u201cIt can be hard to understand. And honestly\u2026\u201d and her voice lowered, as if she were afraid of being overheard, \u201ca lot of postmodernist scholars are just BS artists who spout the jargon to get good jobs.\u201d The young Outis nodded. Corinne continued with some passion. \u201cBut sometimes people just use that as an excuse not to listen to the important things they say. And this speaker\u2019s different.\u201d \u201cI suppose she\u2019s not very well known\u2026?\u201d Corinne eyes danced. \u201cWell, you are an economist\u2026\u201d \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a complete illiterate,\u201d Outis shot back. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m familiar with a lot of postmodernists \u2013 Derrida, Stanley Fish, Judith Butler, Edward Said\u2026\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019ve never heard of her ,\u201d Corinne finished. \u201cWell, maybe she isn\u2019t as chic as some of the others, but she\u2019s very smart \u2013 and clearer than most of them.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Outis said uncertainly. Corinne frowned. Outis took on what he doubtless assumed was a cunning expression. \u201cI\u2019d be more excited to go if afterward we slip out for a walk down the Charles.\u201d She smiled cunningly back at him. I looked desperately at Foucault. \u201cSpirit,\u201d I cried. \u201cShow me no more!\u201d * * * In the next episode, Outis becomes more certain that postmodernist liberalism was not a myth after all.
