He was 57. His wife, Melissa, said that he had died in his sleep and that the cause had not yet been determined. At The Seattle Times, where he shared a Pulitzer in investigative reporting in 1997, and later at The Los Angeles Times, where he was Seattle bureau chief, Mr. Tizon (pronounced  ) was admired as a prose stylist and was known for long, deeply reported articles. He wrote of his own life in \u201cBig Little Man: In Search of My Asian Self. \u201d In the book, he addressed many of the stereotypes he had internalized as an   having experienced them \u201cas a set of suspicions that seemed corroborated by everyday life. \u201d \u201cWhen did this shame inside me begin?\u201d he wrote. \u201cLooking back now, I could say it began with love. Love of the gifted people and their imagined life love of America, the sprawling idea of it, with its gilded tentacles reaching across the Pacific Ocean to wrap around the hearts of small brown people living small brown lives. It was a love bordering on worship, fueled by longing, felt most fervently by those like my parents who grew up with America in their dreams. The love almost killed us. \u201d Mr. Tizon\u2019s memoir detailed his struggle to find masculine Asian role models in Western popular culture and his childhood attempts to make himself look whiter. He recalled dangling from trees to stretch his vertebrae and pinching his nose with a clothespin to narrow it. \u201c\u2018Big Little Man\u2019 is an unflinchingly honest, at times beautifully written, often discomforting examination of Tizon\u2019s remarkable, yet thoroughly relatable, life,\u201d Jay Caspian Kang wrote in The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Tizon said in an online interview with The Boston Globe last year that he thought life had grown better for  . \u201cI have nephews who are just worldbeaters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey read my book, and yeah, they can relate to some of it. But a sense of inferiority? No. That\u2019s just not there. \u201d Michele Matassa Flores, the managing editor of The Seattle Times, said in a phone interview that as a reporter Mr. Tizon \u201cfocused on the gray\u201d rather than seeing the world in black and white. \u201cThe world was not a simple place for Alex,\u201d she added, \u201cand he wanted to convey that to his readers. \u201d On one assignment Mr. Tizon rode through the streets of Seattle with a gang during a period of growing violence in the city in the late 1980s. He also wrote a series of profiles, \u201cCrossing America: Dispatches From a New Nation,\u201d for which he traveled across the country with the photographer Alan Berner after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Tizon, along with Eric Nalder and Deborah Nelson, won the Pulitzer Prize for articles about problems facing a Department of Housing and Urban Development program to help Native Americans build homes. The articles chronicled dysfunction and incompetence within the department, corruption and nepotism at the tribal level, and misallocation of funds at Indian reservations around the country. In many cases, the articles showed, the result was overcrowded hovels for most and   mansions for a connected few. \u201cIt is not much more than a large plywood box, this house Thelma Moses calls home,\u201d one article began. \u201cTo stand outside it is to wonder how such dimensions  \u2014   10 feet by 12 feet  \u2014   can enclose a life. \u201d The series resulted in a congressional investigation and changes in the federal program. Tomas Alexander Tizon was born in Manila on Oct. 30, 1959. His parents, Francisco Tizon and the former Leticia Asuncion, used borrowed money to bring their family to Los Angeles in 1964. The Tizon family lived in Seattle and the South Bronx before settling in Oregon. Alex graduated from high school in Salem, Ore. in 1977 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from the University of Oregon. He received a master\u2019s degree in journalism from Stanford University in 1986, the year he joined The Seattle Times.
