Hillary Isn\u2019t Only One Who Suffers Memory Loss, Look What Bill Just Did\u2026. October 27, 2016 Pinterest \\nBill Clinton will probably have to avoid Hillary even more than usual after his latest showing on the campaign trail, in which it became clear that it isn\u2019t just his wife that has memory issues. \\nSlick Willy was out on the campaign trail on Tuesday, angling to get his lecherous, alleged-rapist butt back in the White House, and apparently he forgot his own criminal business partner wife\u2019s campaign slogan. \\n\u201cBut we were growing together,\u201d Bill said. \u201cThis slampaign slogan of Hillary\u2019s, \u2018growing together,\u2019 it\u2019s more than just two words that sound good.\u201d \\nThat\u2019s not a typo either; according to IJR , Bill called Hillary\u2019s \u201ccampaign slogan\u201d a \u201cslampaign slogan,\u201d before mangling Hillary\u2019s already-stupid actual campaign slogan: \u201cStronger Together.\u201d \\nBill probably shouldn\u2019t use \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d either, since he might lapse into, \u201cand her, and her over there, and her right there too.\u201d \\n\u201cStronger Together\u201d is also the name of Hillary\u2019s flop of a book, which I highly doubt Bill bothered to read, although you can\u2019t really blame him for that; he has a hard enough time staying awake when his wife speaks \u2014 he must be immune to shrill cackling by now. \\nI\u2019m guessing Bill is going to want to stay as far away as he can from Hillary while she likely has one of her infamous \u201ccooling off\u201d periods. Hillary has been widely reported to have a nasty temper , so it\u2019d certainly be wise for Bill to stay far away. \\nHillary can\u2019t be mad for too long though, because it\u2019s likely that she\u2019s going to need Bill to run the White House. Although neither of them appear to be in the greatest health, they can do a great deal of damage between the two of them. \\nBill and Hillary have had a painfully obvious agreement throughout their \u201cmarried life\u201d to help each other politically. Now it\u2019s Hillary\u2019s turn and she\u2019s surely not going to take too kindly to Bill screwing up her ascendancy. \\nNo need to worry Hillary, you\u2019re responsible for the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, ruining the life of a 12-year-old rape victim, and numerous other crimes and disgusting deeds, so a few memory lapses from Bill won\u2019t affect the election. \\nHillary managed to forget answers nearly 40 times during the FBI investigation into her use of private servers to send and receive classified information as secretary of state, so forgetting a dumb campaign slogan should be no big whoop. \\nWhat would be nice is if Bill\u2019s memory lapses led to a moment of clarity and human decency and he let everyone know where the bodies have been buried during the Clinton mafia\u2019s assault on American politics. Won\u2019t happen though; we can\u2019t have nice things\u2026'"}, "time": 1742562955.4684806}
