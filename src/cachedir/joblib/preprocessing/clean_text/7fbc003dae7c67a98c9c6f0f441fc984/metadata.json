Though the current iteration of the program made its debut to considerable fanfare in September, it has had trouble finding a consistent voice under Mr. Colbert, who succeeded David Letterman as host and who has tried to expand his horizons beyond the irreverent political comedy he performed on \u201cThe Colbert Report. \u201d Monday\u2019s installment of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on CBS began with an elaborate, pretaped musical number performed by Mr. Colbert, paying satirical tribute to the Republican convention in Cleveland and the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump. (As Mr. Colbert sang: \u201cThis week, you and me, we will witness history   As the R. N. C. crowns their orange manatee. \u201d) The host followed with a live monologue in which he riffed on moments from the first night of convention and Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana. Later, a taped comedy sketch followed Mr. Colbert to what appeared to be an isolated cabin in the woods, where he knocked on its door and was greeted by a bearded,   Mr. Stewart, who was Mr. Colbert\u2019s boss for many years at \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and is now an executive producer of \u201cThe Late Show. \u201d Alerting Mr. Stewart that it was once again time for a Republican convention, an animated Mr. Colbert told him, \u201cYou will not believe who the nominee is. \u201d He paused to let Mr. Stewart take a sizable drink of water from a mug, then told him, \u201cIt\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d at which point Mr. Stewart doused him in a sizable spit take. The sketch revealed that Mr. Stewart had been sharing his cabin with the Colbert character (brandishing a sword and a Captain America shield). And then \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d (still holding the sword and shield) returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater and performed a new edition of \u201cThe Word,\u201d a recurring segment from \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d which ran from 2005 to 2014. Just as \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d helped introduce audiences to the word \u201ctruthiness,\u201d Mr. Colbert used this latest installment to contemplate the condition of \u201cTrumpiness\u201d: \u201cRemember, elections aren\u2019t about what voters think, it\u2019s about what voters feel. And right now, at least half of Americans feel their voices aren\u2019t being heard. \u201d (An onscreen graphic delivered the punch line: \u201cEspecially Mike Pence. \u201d) After a commercial break, Mr. Colbert returned as  \u2014   presumably  \u2014   himself. \u201cIt was really great to see Jon Stewart again,\u201d he said. With a knowing smile, he added: \u201cYou know what would be nice? To have that happen again some time this week. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564243.1714783}
