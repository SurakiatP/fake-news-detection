The questions came not from the F. B. I. which has closed its investigation into the issue, or from Congress, or even from a news outlet. They came from a nonprofit organization called Judicial Watch. If the 2016 election has brought forward a new generation of Clinton antagonists  \u2014   WikiLeaks, Breitbart, Russia  \u2014   it has also reintroduced America to an old one. Judicial Watch was one of the Clintons\u2019 original tormentors, a charter member of what Mrs. Clinton famously called a \u201cvast   conspiracy\u201d to destroy her and her husband by seizing on any potential scandal. The organization filed its first lawsuit against the Clintons shortly after its formation in 1994, and it pretty much never stopped. It is currently the plaintiff in more than 20 suits involving Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cPeople always used to say to me, \u2018What are you going to do when the Clintons leave? \u2019\u201d Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, said in an interview. \u201cWell, the Clintons never really left. \u201d Neither has Judicial Watch, the indefatigable Clinton adversary that has probably done more than any other individual or organization to create the narrative that Mrs. Clinton is still battling: that she is untrustworthy. It is a narrative that her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, has tried to exploit at every turn, whether he was labeling her \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d saying there was something \u201cvery fishy\u201d about the suicide of her former law partner, Vincent W. Foster Jr. or suggesting that she might be concealing serious health problems. Judicial Watch\u2019s strategy is simple:   the federal courts with Freedom of Information Act lawsuits. A vast majority are dismissed. But Judicial Watch caught a break last year, when revelations about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server prompted two judges to reopen two of the group\u2019s cases connected to her tenure as secretary of state. The lawsuits have since led to the release of hundreds of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails  \u2014   which have, in turn, spurred dozens of news releases and   letters from Judicial Watch that hype the significance of these documents, while putting them in the least flattering light possible for Mrs. Clinton. The group\u2019s lawyers were given permission to depose several of her senior aides from her time at the State Department. What is more, Mrs. Clinton herself will have to answer 25 detailed questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. The questions, some with multiple parts, ask her to explain her rationale for using the private server and her reaction to warnings about the potential for security breaches, among other things. Her answers, to be provided via written testimony to the court, are due by Thursday. Just getting this far has represented a victory for Judicial Watch, which operates out of a nondescript office building in the shadow of the Capitol. Suing the government, repeatedly, is an expensive proposition Judicial Watch has an annual budget of about $35 million that pays for close to 50 employees  \u2014   a mix of lawyers, investigators and  . Mr. Fitton says the group receives donations from nearly 400, 000 individuals and institutions every year. One of its biggest funders, according to public filings, is the Sarah Scaife Foundation, which was created by the banking heir Richard Mellon Scaife, who died in 2014. In the 1990s, Mr. Scaife was one of the leading financiers of the   effort to bring down the Clintons, bankrolling conservative think tanks and publications  \u2014   as well as Judicial Watch. Litigiousness is in the organization\u2019s DNA: Its founder, Larry Klayman, once sued his mother. Mr. Klayman has described himself as a conservative Ralph Nader, but during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, he often behaved more like a   Kenneth W. Starr, papering Washington with subpoenas related to every   Clinton scandal. His departure from the organization in 2003 was accompanied, unsurprisingly, by litigation: Mr. Klayman accused the organization, and his successor, Mr. Fitton, of \u201cfraud, disparagement, defamation, false advertising and other egregious acts. \u201d Mr. Fitton responded that the allegations were \u201cfull of lies and distortions. \u201d The suit is still in the courts. Since he took over in 2003, Mr. Fitton has sought mainstream respectability for the organization. It describes itself as a \u201cnonpartisan educational foundation,\u201d but Mr. Fitton says it is also a media organization. \u201cWe\u2019re filling multiple roles here in a Washington where the traditional vehicles for government accountability have broken down,\u201d he said. Last year, he nominated Judicial Watch for three Pulitzer Prizes. He was told that because Judicial Watch was an advocacy group, it did not meet the Pulitzer committee\u2019s eligibility criteria, a ruling he attributed to liberal bias. If Mr. Fitton is seen as less flamboyant than his predecessor, he has been no less dogged in his pursuit of Mrs. Clinton. In 2009, Judicial Watch sued to prevent her from becoming secretary of state, claiming that an obscure clause in the Constitution prevented former members of Congress who voted to increase the salary of a government position from being appointed to that position. For that matter, Judicial Watch is still suing the government to obtain a draft of the indictment against Mrs. Clinton that federal prosecutors prepared in 1998, when they were considering bringing charges against her in the Whitewater investigation. \u201cI think to say that they are not partisan would not be accurate,\u201d said Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. \u201cLook at the way that they have dealt with the Clintons. It seems as if they\u2019ve been out to do them harm. \u201d According to Mr. Fitton, however, Judicial Watch\u2019s persistence has been rewarded. \u201cThe documents we have uncovered in the last year or so are gobsmacking in terms of what they say about what Mrs. Clinton was up to, the depths of her criminality,\u201d he said. There is little doubt that the group has forced the release of government records that would otherwise have been kept from the public. More contentious is the claim that these documents illuminate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s behavior, at least in the absence of the organization\u2019s spin, which has broadly asserted that the Democratic presidential nominee used her position at the State Department to further the interests of her family\u2019s foundation. A Judicial Watch news release from August highlighted a newly disclosed 2009 email from a Clinton Foundation official to two of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior aides at the State Department, requesting a meeting between a foundation donor and the United States ambassador to Lebanon. \u201cClinton\u2019s top aides\u2019 favors for and interactions with the Clinton Foundation seem in violation of the ethics agreements that Hillary Clinton agreed to in order to be appointed and confirmed as Secretary of State,\u201d the organization wrote. But the ambassador, Jeffrey D. Feltman, subsequently denied that the meeting had taken place. Judicial Watch is a polarizing group, even among advocates for greater government transparency. Critics accuse it of weaponizing the Freedom of Information Act for political purposes. They argue that its unending barrage of lawsuits does more harm than good by draining federal resources, tying up the courts and wasting public servants\u2019 time. The Freedom of Information Act \u201cis a legitimate tool for government transparency, but it\u2019s possible to abuse it,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. \u201cThere is a question about whether they are enriching or distorting political discourse. \u201d The group\u2019s defenders argue that its success in bringing to light thousands of buried emails speaks for itself, and that people can ignore the organization\u2019s spin and make their own decisions about what the records mean. \u201cThey are obviously not just going on fishing expeditions, because they are producing documents that are resulting in stories and public debates,\u201d said Danielle Brian, the director of the Project on Government Oversight. Mr. Fitton, the Judicial Watch president, said his group fought just as hard for transparency during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Notably, it teamed with the Sierra Club in an unsuccessful effort to obtain the records of Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s energy policy task force. Judicial Watch\u2019s claims of nonpartisanship will be tested if Republicans win the White House next month. For now, anyway, Mr. Trump seems safe from the group\u2019s scrutiny. Mr. Fitton, when asked if he was concerned about the Republican nominee\u2019s unwillingness to release his tax returns, said he was far more troubled by the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s decision to audit Mr. Trump. \u201cI think the I. R. S. is a Sword of Damocles over the First Amendment, and I think it is a menace,\u201d he said. And the pending federal action against Trump University for defrauding students? Mr. Fitton, whose organization has filed about 300 lawsuits against the Obama administration, described it as \u201cambulance chasing. \u201d As for Mrs. Clinton, she can expect to remain in the group\u2019s sights whether she wins or loses. \u201cEveryone wants to move on,\u201d Mr. Fitton said. \u201cWe don\u2019t move on. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564239.588768}
