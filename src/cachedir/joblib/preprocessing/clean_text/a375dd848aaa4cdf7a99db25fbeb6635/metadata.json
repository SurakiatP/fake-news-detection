If that sounds like faint praise, well, it is and it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s always something to be said for an entertainment that sustains its nuttiness all the way to its twisty finish. This one may not make much sense, but  \u2014   like a demented old film noir or a Shonda Rhimes show at its crazed best  \u2014   \u201cGirl\u201d doesn\u2019t falter in its absurdity or commitment to its own seriousness. It never winks. You may laugh (as the audience I saw it with did, on and off) but there\u2019s genuine pleasure in that mirth. It\u2019s based on the 2015 book by the British author Paula Hawkins that vaulted to the top of the   list with a mix of unreliable narration, suspicious characters, ugly emotions, freewheeling gender stereotypes and a slowly kinking mystery that becomes as perilous as the labyrinth at the Overlook Hotel. With a troika of dubious female narrators, the book isn\u2019t an obvious choice for the big screen, partly because of its rotating   voices. One problem is how to get into those separate heads, which the director Tate Taylor has tried to solve with   and by piling on   creating a proximity approaching the dermatological. Its loomingest head belongs to the   Emily Blunt, who plays Rachel, the story\u2019s hub. She was once married to Tom (Justin Theroux, trying out his smile) who\u2019s now married to Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) with whom he has a baby. A hard drinker, Rachel chugs booze like water and weeps like a broken faucet. She\u2019s a sloshy mess, or so we\u2019re meant to believe from her alternating lightly or heavily smeared eyeliner, which functions as a kind of mood  . She\u2019s a masochist: She stares out of a   window at the house where she lived with Tom, and where he now lives with Anna and their child. Rachel is also a fantasist: She ogles another couple, dreaming about their lives. Put another way, Rachel is a   for us, the viewer, the voyeur who peers into other lives. Specifically, she\u2019s a proxy for the consumer of a certain kind of glorious romantic fiction, in which beautiful women suffer magnificently. Hollywood used to excel at these kinds of stories, movies in which, say, Bette Davis or Ingrid Bergman suffered, endured and suffered some more before their teary,     triumph. Those types of movies aren\u2019t all that common in American cinema these days, partly because women and their stories aren\u2019t. The sobs and drama nonetheless did keep flowing, first in daytime soap operas and later in nighttime soaps. Rachel is a clever surrogate, especially because she doesn\u2019t really appear that far gone. She may drink way too much, but, well, she looks like the lovely, spunky and very appealing Ms. Blunt, just with chapped lips, splotchy skin and raccoon eyes. Like almost every star in a mainstream vehicle who plays a problematic character, Ms. Blunt  \u2014   her persona, filmography, likability, relatability  \u2014   serves as a kind of assurance from the filmmakers to the viewers not to worry, that things will turn out all right. Her stardom is our light at the end of the dark tunnel, a flickering promise, which is one thing that hasn\u2019t changed much since the days of   female martyrdom. You need a tough woman for that sort of job, and Ms. Blunt, who moves easily out of crinolines and into combat gear, holds this material together with fierce, unwavering conviction. Rachel\u2019s fantasy duo turn out to be Megan (Haley Bennett) and Scott (Luke Evans) a married couple who tend to pose or rut whenever Rachel\u2019s train conveniently passes by. Megan also likes to stand on her balcony, playing peekaboo with her robe and flashing her undies and tummy. Or at least that\u2019s how Rachel sees Megan. That\u2019s also how we see Megan, an outlook that\u2019s meant to change as the points of view shift, diverge and unite. As always, much depends on who\u2019s telling the story. Mr. Taylor doesn\u2019t so much juggle the movie\u2019s various parts  \u2014   including a fragmented timeline, a device that here is nothing but empty mannerism  \u2014   as lob them at the screen. (Erin Cressida Wilson wrote the script.) When Megan disappears, Rachel turns detective, if one mildly hindered by her drinking and narratively convenient habit of blacking out, which means that she doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s happened in her own life. Rachel goes through a crucible of agony, braving abuse, infertility, betrayal and ravages of the body and the mind. But she looks. And she learns, including about other women. That\u2019s the moral of this story, the appealing, gleaming jewel in the trash. \u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for extremely bad adult behavior.
