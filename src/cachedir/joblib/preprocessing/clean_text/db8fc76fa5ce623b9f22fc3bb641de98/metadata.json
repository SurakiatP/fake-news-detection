C.  \u2014   Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu says Turkey has been \u201cvery clear\u201d in explaining its presence in Syria: to defeat the Islamic State. [While expressing support for a political mechanism to remove dictator Bashar   \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu did not affirm Erdo\u011fan\u2019s statement expressly stating that Turkey\u2019s army had entered Syria \u201cto end the rule of the tyrant Assad, who terrorizes with state terror. \u201d   \u201cFrom the beginning, our target has been very clear. We have been in Syria to defeat Daesh and to clear many cities in Manbij from Daesh and make those areas   or   zones. \u201d He added, \u201cour position regarding Assad has also been very clear. Assad has killed more than 600, 000 innocent people,\u201d he said, noting that the Syrian dictator has used chemical weapons \u201cincluding chlorine gas to carry out these atrocities. \u201d Turkey has been accused of playing a \u201cdouble game\u201d on the Islamic State in Syria. President Erdo\u011fan has been accused of helping the terrorist organization in their fight against Kurdish rebels and Syria\u2019s President Bashar  . An   State militant told Newsweek in 2014 that the Islamic State saw Turkey as its ally: \u201cISIS commanders told us to fear nothing at all because there was full cooperation with the Turks. \u201d The man, who was named \u201cSherko Omer\u201d for his safety, said, \u201cISIS and Turkey cooperate together on the ground on the basis that they have a common enemy to destroy, the Kurds. \u201d Last year,   reported, \u201cThe Cumhuriyet daily\u2019s    Can Dundar and Ankara representative Erdem Gul landed behind bars Nov. 27 for reporting that Turkish intelligence shipped weapons to radical Islamists in Syria. Though they were released three months later, they eventually received jail terms for revealing state secrets. \u201d In October 2015, nearly 130 people were killed in Turkey after two suspected Islamic State bombers attacked a rally put on by a group of   leftists, the first of a string of bombings and mass shooting the Islamic State has taken credit for within Turkey. In November, Erdo\u011fan announced that Turkey was in Syria \u201cto end the rule of the tyrant   who terrorizes with state terror. \u201d He insisted that his forces were not in Syria for \u201cany other reason. \u201d Several days later, Erdo\u011fan reportedly clarified his statement in what was seen as backpedaling of his admission to seeing that Assad\u2019s regime is toppled, saying instead that his troops are only in Syria to target \u201cterror organizations. \u201d In the month of March 2016 alone, the   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented the deaths of 2, 658 people, including 588 civilians. There were 125 children killed in the conflict. They died in bombings, by mortars, IEDs or random gunfire. \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu asked, \u201cAre we going to legitimize such a regime?\u201d Asked whether removal of Assad is currently possible without leaving a power vacuum ripe for exploitation by Iran and Hezbollah, \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said, \u201cthere will be no vacuum if the political process works. \u201d He added, \u201cwhile we are defeating Daesh on the ground, we need to focus on political solutions,\u201d which include talks in both Astana and Geneva. Pressed further and asked if he still felt this way considering Iran\u2019s role in the region, which has been instrumental in causing instability, he added, \u201cIran\u2019s role there is very clear. It\u2019s dominating not only in Syria but also dominating the politics in Iraq. Therefore, if we only target Daesh, we will be serving the interests of Iran and Hezbollah and other groups on the ground. I don\u2019t think we prefer this. \u201d Breitbart News reported that the Pentagon, which has been working with the Syrian Kurdish YPG and the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga to take Daesh down, has cast some doubt on Turkey\u2019s role in taking Daesh out in the northern reaches of Syria. \u201cWe have made clear  \u2026     that we are open to a Turkish role in the continued operations to defeat ISIS in northern Syria,\u201d We haven\u2019t come to an agreement about what that role will be or if there will be one,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Col. John Dorrian said. \u201cBut we talk to Turkey through military channels and I believe at diplomatic levels every day. \u201d He added, \u201cI think I\u2019d like to leave it at we would expect Kurds to be involved. And that\u2019s probably about where we\u2019re at. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz. This article has been edited since publication.'"}, "time": 1742562191.917202}
