On Wednesday, the public representatives of two embattled American institutions  \u2014   United Airlines and the White House  \u2014   found themselves on national television grappling with a delicate and increasingly common ritual of the corporate and political worlds: the public apology. Oscar Munoz, United\u2019s chief executive, recalled his \u201cshame\u201d upon seeing a cellphone video, shared by millions of people, of a paying passenger being violently evicted from one of his airline\u2019s flights. Face taut, voice soft, Mr. Munoz\u2019s televised prostration was a far cry from the robotic statement issued by United days earlier, expressing regret for \u201c \u201d a traveler. Around the same time, President Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, was denouncing himself as \u201creprehensible\u201d for having favorably compared Hitler to President Bashar   of Syria and referring to Nazi death camps as \u201cHolocaust centers,\u201d all while standing at the White House podium. The fine art of repentance is a skill taught in business schools and promoted by   consultants. But all kinds of offenders in public life still seem to struggle with the execution. Corporations like BP and Wells Fargo have faced criticism for dawdling responses to cascading crises, while politicians from Bill Clinton to Anthony Weiner have had difficulty admitting to peccadilloes. The key to contrition, according to   experts, is projecting sincerity, humanity, and a   demeanor  \u2014   the better to convince a cynical public. And in this age of whipsawing social media, you had better do it fast. \u201cThe head of United should never have been allowed to take three swings at correcting and apologizing for an incident that was on more social media than Kim and Kanye\u2019s wedding,\u201d said Mortimer Matz, a New York consultant who has guided decades\u2019 worth of clients through crises small and large. United issued several halting statements about the plane episode, which first emerged Monday morning, before Mr. Munoz made his abject appearance on Wednesday on ABC. Mr. Matz said the airline had missed its moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a fast thinker in the digital age,\u201d said Mr. Matz, who will be 93 in July. Many companies now take steps to be nimble and responsive when a furor erupts online. Last week, Pepsi took less than 24 hours to apologize and retract a   advertising campaign that used populist imagery to sell soda. It was a rapid   that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. This week, Mr. Spicer was quick to recognize the damage done by his   remarks, which prompted immediate denunciations on Twitter as well as calls for his resignation. He appeared on CNN within hours of his gaffe, while Mr. Munoz waited two days. Still, Mr. Spicer\u2019s apology came only after his office tried to clarify his remarks with several statements that, while remorseful, did not clearly admit error. On Wednesday, in a previously scheduled interview at the Newseum in Washington, Mr. Spicer took a new tack: no excuses. \u201cI made a mistake there\u2019s no other way to say it,\u201d Mr. Spicer told Greta van Susteren, the MSNBC anchor, his tone notably subdued. \u201cI got into a topic that I shouldn\u2019t have, and I screwed up. \u201d He added: \u201cIt really is painful to myself to know that I did something like that. \u201d Mr. Munoz, interviewed on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Wednesday, was similarly solemn. \u201cThat shame and embarrassment was pretty palpable for me,\u201d he told the correspondent Rebecca Jarvis, emotion in his voice. \u201cThis can never  \u2014   will never  \u2014   happen again on a United Airlines flight. That\u2019s my premise and that\u2019s my promise. \u201d Later on Wednesday, United said it would refund the fares of all passengers on the affected flight. Both Mr. Munoz, who was named \u201ccommunicator of the year\u201d by PR Week magazine last month, and Mr. Spicer took pains to personalize their apologies. It\u2019s a technique that, conscious or not, is recommended by crisis experts. \u201cThat\u2019s on me, I have to fix that,\u201d Mr. Munoz said when asked about the airline policies that led to the violent ejection. Mr. Spicer described his blunder as \u201cmine to own, mine to apologize for, mine to ask forgiveness for. \u201d That    approach, consultants say, is one of the few ways to start rebuilding trust. The accounting firm PwC, for instance, gave a detailed explanation, and quick apology, for this year\u2019s Oscar best picture fiasco, eventually holding onto its Academy Awards account. \u201cPeople want someone to throw the book at,\u201d said Katie Sprehe, a senior director at the communications firm APCO Worldwide. Ms. Sprehe, who studies reputation maintenance, said United had erred by not moving swiftly to mirror its customers\u2019 outrage. \u201cYou need to speak your stakeholders\u2019 language, and coming out with P. R. mumbo jumbo, like \u2018\u2019 is the wrong thing to do,\u201d she said. Stu Loeser, an adviser to executives in the technology and finance industries, said that a   apology must be considered in context. \u201cOscar Munoz answers to more than 85, 000 employees who want to know that if they were the ones caught in a viral video maelstrom, he\u2019d back them up,\u201d said Mr. Loeser, who was press secretary to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. \u201cSean Spicer ultimately answers to one person and one person only\u201d  \u2014   Mr. Trump  \u2014   \u201csomeone who sees backing down or apologizing as not only a weakness, but a character flaw. \u201d \u201cIn both cases,\u201d Mr. Loeser added, \u201cwhat might appear to be an irrational series of statements that got you into trouble makes more sense, when you think about who they\u2019re actually answering to. \u201d Mr. Munoz ended his interview by saying he had no plans to resign. \u201cI was hired to make United better, and I\u2019ve been doing that, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll continue to do,\u201d he said. Mr. Spicer, asked by Ms. Van Susteren if he enjoyed being press secretary, said he loved it. \u201cI truly do believe it\u2019s an honor to have this job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a privilege. And if you don\u2019t believe it, then you shouldn\u2019t be here. \u201d Whether the apologies outlive the gaffes remains to be seen. Ken Sunshine, who founded the   firm Sunshine Sachs, said he was skeptical. \u201cMy rule?\u201d he said. \u201cYou get one shot. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563709.357447}
