But the White House, still smarting from a disastrous defeat on Friday, appeared uncertain on the path forward. President Trump predicted that \u201cObamacare will explode\u201d and offered no plan to stop it, but his was not the only voice from the White House. The president \u201cwants to make sure that people don\u2019t get left behind\u201d in the search for affordable, quality health care, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said on \u201cFox News Sunday. \u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s time for our folks to come together,\u201d Mr. Priebus said, adding that it is time to \u201cpotentially get a few moderate Democrats on board, as well\u201d as they try to bring down premiums and stabilize insurance markets. That appeal was echoed by Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican who opposed the House Republicans\u2019 health bill and has also worked with Democrats to explore changes to the Affordable Care Act without repealing it. \u201cWith the demise of the House bill, there\u2019s a real window of opportunity for a bipartisan approach to health care,\u201d she said. In the wake of the Republican failure to make good on the    promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders find themselves at a political crossroads. They could sabotage the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance markets, betting that Democrats would be blamed for collapsing coverage choices and spikes in insurance premiums and would then come to the negotiating table ready to toss the law and start fresh. Or they could work with Democratic lawmakers and moderate Republicans, who for years have discussed improvements to the Affordable Care Act, which, unlike many social welfare programs, has not been significantly updated or revised. Speaker Paul D. Ryan has said he wants to move on to other issues, and indicated that Democrats would have to come to him if they want to cooperate on health care. After insisting that the health law had to be eradicated \u201croot and branch,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has been remarkably quiet since Friday\u2019s debacle. The messages from the White House, so far, have been mixed. \u201cYou cannot fix a broken system,\u201d the White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press. \u201d \u201cYou are never going to fix that. This system must be removed. \u201d Mr. Trump appeared to endorse the    strategy on Saturday morning, saying on Twitter: \u201cObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great health care plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!\u201d But Mr. Priebus\u2019s softer vision gave some in Congress hope that a bipartisan approach could be found  \u2014   possibly to alleviate the health law\u2019s burdens on small business, repeal some of its more unpopular taxes, give employers more leeway on which employees they have to offer insurance to, and foster more competition among insurance companies. \u201cI believe that there is a group of centrist Democrats who recognize that the Affordable Care Act has flaws that must be fixed,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cUntil there was a repudiation of the House bill, they felt constrained from negotiating. Now that the House bill has died, I hope they will feel free to come to the table. \u201d Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, also called for bipartisanship. His state has benefited from its expansion of Medicaid under the health law, and would have been punished under the House Republican bill because its high premium costs would not have been offset by larger tax credits, as they are under current law. \u201cThe reason why Obamacare failed was because it wasn\u2019t a bipartisan bill,\u201d Mr. Young said. Republicans, he said, made the same mistake, writing their bill without Democrats. \u201cWe were very frankly guilty of that,\u201d he said. Democrats also sounded more conciliatory. \u201cUntil now, we haven\u2019t talked at all about compromise on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado. \u201cFrom the moment it passed, Republicans started their mantra of \u2018repeal and replace.\u2019 Now that repeal seems to be off the table, I think it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to make the law work better for our constituents. \u201d Representative Jim Cooper, a centrist Democrat from Tennessee who has often worked with Republicans, said: \u201cWe need to fix the flaws in Obamacare. I hope Republicans are willing to do that, instead of just destroying Obamacare. \u201d But, he added, \u201cbefore we can work with them, the Republicans have to bargain in good faith and stop sabotaging Obamacare. \u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law may not be imploding, as President Trump says. But in states as diverse as Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, the public insurance marketplaces  \u2014   a central innovation of the Affordable Care Act  \u2014   are in trouble. Consumers have seen big premium increases for health plans sold by a shrinking number of insurers. \u201cPeople will have to come to the bargaining table sooner rather than later,\u201d said Chris Jacobs, a health policy analyst. Within a few weeks, insurers must decide whether they will participate in the marketplaces in 2018. Insurance markets could quickly unravel if the House wins a court case challenging the legality of subsidies paid by the government to insurers on behalf of   people. \u201cThe comments by President Trump and Speaker Ryan predicting the collapse of the A. C. A. and health insurance exchanges could become a   prophecy,\u201d said Kevin J. Counihan, who was the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, HealthCare. gov, under Mr. Obama. Mr. Counihan said he saw a risk that some counties might not have any insurers on the exchange next year as major insurers like Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth pull back from the program. Republicans in Congress, especially those from rural areas, share that concern. The Obama administration worked hard to keep insurers in the market, and to promote   during open enrollment season. Whether the Trump administration will do so is unclear. Mr. Counihan suggested several areas where Republicans and Democrats in Congress could work together. They could, he said, give insurers more discretion to charge higher premiums for older adults, reflecting their medical costs. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers can charge older adults no more than three times the rates for young adults. The House Republican bill would have allowed them to charge five times as much, or more if states wanted. A ceiling somewhere between those numbers might be appropriate, Mr. Counihan said. In addition, he said, Congress could shorten the length of \u201cgrace periods\u201d during which insurers must provide coverage to consumers who fail to pay their premiums. Lawmakers from both parties have also expressed a desire to give states more freedom to pursue their own ideas for expanding coverage, controlling health costs, reducing premiums and stabilizing insurance markets. Giving states more flexibility is consistent with Republicans\u2019 federalism philosophy. It also has potential appeal to Democrats because many states, including some with Republican governors, are to the left of the Trump administration on health policy. One section of the Affordable Care Act, added at the behest of Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, already allows waivers for innovations in state health policy. But states say the requirements are so stringent that the waivers are of limited use. \u201cAs Republicans, we know that     works for no one and certainly did not work for the individual markets,\u201d said Representative Michael C. Burgess of Texas, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health. Lawmakers of both parties also support legislation to help small businesses get insurance. As a possible model for bipartisan cooperation, they point to a bill signed by Mr. Obama in 2015 that changed the definition of \u201csmall employer\u201d to protect such companies against increases in health insurance premiums. The possibility of bipartisan cooperation may not last long. Some conservative Republicans like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative Sean P. Duffy of Wisconsin said they would redouble their efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act. \u201cRip it all out by the roots!\u201d Representative Steve King of Iowa said Friday in a Twitter post. But other Republicans said that Democrats should be involved in efforts to rewrite the law. Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina, opposed the House bill and said its demise could \u201cprove to be a catalyst\u201d for forging a consensus. \u201cSeeming stopping points can ultimately prove to be beginning points in life,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561658.7698114}
