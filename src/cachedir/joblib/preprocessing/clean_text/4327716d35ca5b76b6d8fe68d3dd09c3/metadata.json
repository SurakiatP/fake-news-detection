With a full slate of films headed to the big screen in the next few months, here\u2019s a look at notable trailers. Feb. 10 THE MOVIE In the sequel to the   smash \u201cFifty Shades of Grey,\u201d Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) try to reconnect after she left him when his    tastes proved too extreme for her. WHY THE TRAILER IS INTRIGUING Well, it\u2019s at least one shade darker. Ana seems to have a stalker. Or maybe she\u2019s a hallucination? This woman appears a few times, creepily hovering like the girl from \u201cThe Ring,\u201d but that\u2019s all we get. Her presence is never explained, even though it\u2019s one of the few things that suggest this film is different from the last one. Otherwise, \u201cFifty Shades Darker\u201d seems to take everything people liked and loathed about \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d and double it. Meaningful glances are everywhere. Some scenes in the trailer are a little more suggestive, though there might be a public indecency law broken in one of them. Even the wooden dialogue is back. (Although perhaps more   the first line of the trailer, \u201cI want you back,\u201d feels like a plea from the producers.) Even the music is the same. The trailer for \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d was set to a slower, spookier remix of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy in Love. \u201d Not to be outdone, this trailer brings in the RB star Miguel for a breathy, hauntingly sexy cover that\u2019s just distinct enough to merit notice. And hey, why not? The music worked last time.  March 3 THE MOVIE After playing Wolverine for close to two decades, Hugh Jackman is set to hang up his adamantium claws in the latest chapter of the   saga, which takes its name from the character\u2019s civilian identity. WHY THE TRAILER IS INTRIGUING The previews for   movies tend to draw on the familiar: iconic costumes and spectacular C. G. I. set pieces while   superheroes. Innocent bystanders are in peril. Something explodes. Not the trailer for \u201cLogan,\u201d released in October, which sweeps all mentions of   or Wolverine under the rug. Instead, it suggests a   western. Johnny Cash\u2019s cover of \u201cHurt,\u201d a song about pain, provides the through line, connecting all the shots of a weary, older Mr. Jackman. The   Logan is shown alone, backed by dusty deserts and rusting equipment. He\u2019s battered, bloodied and wizened. It\u2019s Wolverine, by way of Clint Eastwood. The trailer positions Logan as a Wild West outlaw, making a break from the superhero genre. When antagonists appear, they arrive in a caravan of police cars. One character even wears a cowboy hat and poncho. So by the time Logan finally unsheathes his claws, toward the trailer\u2019s end, it\u2019s a jarring tonal break from what seems like a quieter, smaller film. April 28 THE MOVIE Based on Dave Eggers\u2019s novel, \u201cThe Circle\u201d follows Mae (Emma Watson) an eager   with a job at the Circle, a Silicon Valley tech behemoth that Mr. Eggers has said is definitely not Google, Apple or Facebook. WHY THE TRAILER IS INTRIGUING It totally makes the movie seem like it\u2019s about Google, Apple or Facebook, at a moment when that couldn\u2019t be more relevant. The film\u2019s first trailer, released in early December, opens with Mae describing the Circle as \u201cthe chaos of the web made elegant. \u201d In the midst of the postelection   over social media and fake news, that characterization certainly stands out. After that, Mae attends a keynote address delivered by a Circle leader, played by Tom Hanks, who stands in front of the company logo and wears a dark sweater that looks like the love child of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s hoodies and Steve Jobs\u2019s classic turtlenecks. He speaks about the power of technology, luring us in with his \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d voice, while Mae and her colleagues attend meetings and take selfies. \u201cSharing is caring,\u201d they chant emphatically. It\u2019s a sharp contrast from a   discussion about whether that\u2019s actually true. (Oh, hey, don\u2019t forget to share this column on Facebook!) The dark turn is inevitable, even without our current conversation about technology in 2016. So the trailer adds to the drama with a   and   cover of the Hall  Oates song \u201cPrivate Eyes. \u201d A voice chants over piano, \u201cThey\u2019re watching you,\u201d drawing audiences further in with a foreboding warning about both the story onscreen and what might be happening off. May 12 THE MOVIE Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn are a   pair who go on vacation in South America and get, uh, snatched. It\u2019s Ms. Schumer\u2019s   to her successful 2015   \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d and Ms. Hawn\u2019s first film appearance in 15 years. WHY THE TRAILER IS INTRIGUING Comedy trailers can be a tough sell. They have to keep us laughing for two minutes while promising there\u2019s enough to keep us laughing for two hours. That requires shoehorning exposition and plot into a tight comedic structure without shortchanging the humor. The \u201cSnatched\u201d trailer, released in December, finds the right balance. It\u2019s certainly  . From the start, it establishes Ms. Schumer\u2019s character in an embarrassing breakup scene that brings her comedy chops to the forefront. Then it zips along to her mother\u2019s home, where Ms. Hawn awkwardly comforts Ms. Schumer with a hug that immediately establishes the uneasiness in their relationship. The trailer ushers them to South America with a quick conversation that further explains who they are: a young woman trying to find herself and a mother mired in routine. As the trailer introduces more plot elements  \u2014   a man, the titular snatching, the escape  \u2014   it keeps the jokes coming with a remarkable narrative economy. Plus, it gives equal time to Ms. Schumer and Ms. Hawn, suggesting both women will be making memorable returns to the big screen.'"}, "time": 1742563606.6175103}
