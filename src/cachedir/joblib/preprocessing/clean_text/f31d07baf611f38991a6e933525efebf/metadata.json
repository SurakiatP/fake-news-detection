Ms. Prout said she was attacked in a mechanical room at the school in May 2014. In the trial that ended last August, a senior, Owen Labrie, was cleared of felony sexual assault charges but convicted of misdemeanor charges, including having sex with someone below the age of consent. Mr. Labrie, now 20, was sentenced to a year in prison and had to register as a sex offender in New Hampshire. He was freed on $15, 000 bail pending his appeal, during which he was ordered to comply with a 5 p. m. curfew at his mother\u2019s home in Vermont. The case cast a spotlight on a culture  of secret rites and sexual conquest at St. Paul\u2019s, including the \u201csenior salute,\u201d in which older students tried to engage younger ones in intimate acts: kissing, touching or more. The trial included details about the tradition, in which a key to the mechanical room on campus was passed around by senior classmates. Prosecutors said Mr. Labrie had drawn up a list of potential girls for his senior salute, and according to an affidavit, he told the police that he was \u201ctrying to be No. 1 in the sexual scoring at St. Paul\u2019s School. \u201d Ms. Prout spent days testifying on the stand during the trial, saying that the accused had bitten her during the encounter and that she had told him \u201cno\u201d more than once. Mr. Labrie said the encounter had been consensual and had stopped short of sex. A statement from his lawyers on Tuesday said, \u201cWe remain hopeful that Mr. Labrie will receive a new trial where the full truth of what occurred with be revealed. \u201d In the interview on Tuesday, Ms. Prout described the difficulties of testifying. \u201cIt was something that was necessary,\u201d she said, \u201calthough it was scary. \u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without having been able to speak up for myself during that time. \u201d She added, \u201cI want other people to feel empowered and just strong enough to be able to say: \u2018I have the right to my body. I have the right to say no. \u2019\u201d Ms. Prout said she was upset by how Mr. Labrie\u2019s testimony was received by the jury of nine men and three women. \u201cThey said that they didn\u2019t believe that he did it knowingly, and that frustrated me a lot because he definitely did do it knowingly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the fact that he was still able to pull the wool over a group of people\u2019s eyes bothered me a lot and just disgusted me in some way. \u201d The aftermath of the trial was also troubling, Ms. Prout said. She was determined to return to the school, she said, but some male friends refused to speak to her. On one occasion, she said, two senior football players organizing a Powder Puff football game said, \u201c\u2018We\u2019re only directing this at the upper formers because we\u2019re not allowed to look at lower formers anymore. \u2019\u201d She said she was \u201cthinking that that had to be approved by the rector of the school. \u201d \u201cAnd they let those boys go up there and make a joke about consent and the age. \u201d \u201cI tried my best to go back to my school and try to have a normal life again. But if they\u2019re going to treat this topic as a joke, this is not a place I want to be,\u201d she added. Ms. Prout\u2019s parents are suing the school for failing to \u201cmeet its most basic obligations to protect the children entrusted to its care,\u201d The Concord Monitor reported in June, quoting a copy of the filing. In an emailed statement about Ms. Prout on Tuesday, the school said it \u201cadmires her courage and condemns unkind behavior toward her. \u201d It added, \u201cWe feel deeply for her and her family. \u201d \u201cWe have always placed the safety and   of our students first and are confident that the environment and culture of the school have supported that,\u201d the school said. \u201cWe categorically deny that there ever existed at the school a culture or tradition of sexual assault. However, there\u2019s no denying the survivor\u2019s experience caused us to look anew at the culture and environment. \u201d Ms. Prout said she was working on a new social media campaign with the nonprofit organization Pave to support victims of sexual assault. Mr. Labrie was jailed in March after a judge ruled that he had violated his curfew in Vermont. But in May, a judge released Mr. Labrie again on bail.'"}, "time": 1742562510.006753}
