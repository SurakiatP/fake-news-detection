Yes, we\u2019re all sad in Los Angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the 30th anniversary of its last World Series appearance, but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride. \\nThe Dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a Cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the \u201cIndians,\u201d but also resurrected the laughably racist, red-faced mascot Chief Wahoo just in time for the playoffs. \\nFor those who haven\u2019t kept up with the baseball drama, here\u2019s a summary: The Cleveland team drew the curtain on its regular-season minstrel show in the spring, having replaced Chief Wahoo on its caps with a vintage red \u201cC.\u201d It never officially retired the offending mascot, but Wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season, leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the NFL\u2019s Washington Redskins remained defiantly in the dark, and was easing its fans into the post-\u201cIndians\u201d era. \\nOr so we thought. Chief Wahoo reappeared when the Cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the Boston Red Sox, and he hasn\u2019t left. He remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring Cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, even surviving a legal attack by advocates of Canada\u2019s indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term \u201cIndians\u201d while the team was on Canadian soil. \\n{snip} \\nIt\u2019s tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city that\u2019s had it as rough as Cleveland. The Cubs\u2019 championship drought has famously lasted for 107 baseball seasons, but the Cleveland team boasts a pitiable 67 years without a World Series title. Beyond sports, Cleveland\u2019s decline as an important American metropolis is arguably unmatched, having tumbled from a population peak of 900,000-plus in 1950 to less than 400,000 today. {snip} \\nBut Cleveland? Hey, I know some generous, wonderfully caring people from that part of Ohio, which makes wishing for their team\u2019s brutal defeat personally difficult. But being on the right side of a moral dispute isn\u2019t supposed to be easy, especially when the team in question isn\u2019t the evil Washington Redskins and its infernal owner, Daniel Snyder. Cleveland\u2019s municipal misery doesn\u2019t excuse the disgraceful exalting of Chief Wahoo any more than white men\u2019s economic hardship makes Donald Trump\u2019s popularity OK. \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742564599.1979644}
