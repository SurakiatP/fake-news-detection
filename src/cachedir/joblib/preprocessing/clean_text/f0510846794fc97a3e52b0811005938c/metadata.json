He may, in fact, be initiating the first stages of militarily securing the long-desired Turkish Stream pipeline. \\nAs highlighted , positioning the aircraft carrier-led fleet just off the western coast of Syria in the Mediterranean also strategically places it between friendly nations to the north and south \u2014 Turkey, with whom the pipeline deal was officially signed last week, and Egypt, with whom Russia is now expanding ties both militarily and economically. \\nBut in truth, the agreements being struck around the Mediterranean \u2014 while unquestionably important in their own right \u2014 are indicative of a much broader, and rather recent, Russian pattern. \\nOn the southeast border of Russian ally, Iran, for instance, lies Pakistan. Russia raised eyebrows back in September when it announced that for the first time in modern history Russia and Pakistan would conduct joint military drills \u2014 a signal Russia\u2019s influence is spreading across Asia. \\nIn October, it was reported additional joint exercises between the two nations had been scheduled for 2017. \\nPakistan\u2019s neighbor to the east is India. In mid-October, it was announced Russia\u2019s largely state-owned oil company Rosneft, along with other partners, would invest around $12.9 billion in India\u2019s Essar Oil. Additionally, a Russian state investment fund would work with an Indian counterpart to invest $1 billion toward Indian infrastructure. Share:'"}, "time": 1742628370.9554698}
