This time, it\u2019s the fake news story about Trump \u201cleaking\u201d classified information to the Russkies. [The president can\u2019t \u201cleak\u201d classified information: It\u2019s his to declassify.  The big secret Trump allegedly revealed is that Muslims might try to blow up a plane with laptops. I already knew that. I read it in The New York Times. The New York Times, March 22, 2017: Devices Banned on Some Planes Over ISIS Fears, Intelligence showing that the Islamic State is developing a bomb hidden in portable electronics spurred the United States and Britain on Tuesday to bar passengers from airports in a total of 10   countries from carrying laptop computers   \u2026     two senior American counterterrorism officials said.   \u2026     This totally secret, Deep   information has been widely published in thousands of news outlets throughout the civilized world. There was yet another round of stories last week with the update that the U. S. is considering a laptop ban on flights from Europe as well. Hey, you know what might make more sense than banning laptops? How about banning Muslims? Bear with me here, I\u2019m still working out the details, but I\u2019m almost certain a federal judge in Hawaii can\u2019t block a president\u2019s temporary ban on Muslim immigration just because he\u2019s testy with Trump over some campaign statements. As Northwestern law professor Eugene Kontorovich explained in The Washington Post, courts have never examined a politician\u2019s campaign statements for improper motive, because 1) campaigns are not part of the deliberative process and 2) to start doing so would open the door to \u201cexaminations of the entire lives of political officials whose motives may be relevant to legal questions. \u201d Nonetheless, Kontorovich says, that is the legal argument being advanced against Trump\u2019s travel ban: \u201cTrump is a bigot, and thus his winning presidential campaign in fact impeaches him from exercising key constitutional and statutory powers, such as administering the immigration laws. \u201d To preserve their judicial coup, this Monday, the 9th Circuit sent out the geriatric ward to hear an appeal of the Hawaii judge\u2019s absurd ruling. At their ages, there\u2019s a good chance the judges will be dead by the time the Supreme Court overturns them. Arguing against Trump\u2019s exercise of his constitutional and statutory powers was   American, Neal Katyal. (There are plenty of    . You couldn\u2019t get one of them to argue that we should end our country through mass immigration?) At oral argument before the three wheezing gargoyles, Katyal announced that, before enforcing federal immigration laws passed by generations of Democrats and Republicans working together in Congress, the president of the United States is required to profess: \u201cIslam is peace. \u201d There\u2019s a new legal principle! Asked by one of the   if Trump is the only president who would be prohibited from issuing this precise travel ban because of his statements about Muslims, the smarmy, preening, pretentious Katyal answered: \u201cI think the most important point is, if you don\u2019t say all these things, you never wind up with an executive order like this. \u201d As lawyers say: Nonresponsive! But as long as we\u2019re operating under these new rules for determining a U. S. president\u2019s rights and responsibilities, how about looking at everything Trump has said about Muslims? For example, may the courts consider this quote from September 2015? Trump: \u201cI love the Muslims. I think they are great people.   \u2026     Would I consider putting a   in my Cabinet? Oh, absolutely. No problem with that. \u201d Lawyers like Katyal aren\u2019t telling the courts what Trump said they\u2019re telling courts their own crazy interpretations of what Trump said. No liberal is capable of accurately reporting Trump\u2019s position because the left never understood his position in the first place. As Peter Thiel said, the media take Trump literally, but not seriously, while the people take him seriously, but not literally. After the San Bernardino terrorist attacks in December 2015, Trump made the perfectly reasonable suggestion that we curtail our breakneck importation of Muslims, some of whom periodically erupt in murderous violence. The media concluded: TRUMP HATES MUSLIMS! Nothing Trump or anyone else said could persuade them otherwise. Here\u2019s what Trump actually said: What\u2019s happened is, we\u2019re out of control. We have no idea who\u2019s coming into our country. We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us.   \u2026     I have friends that are Muslims. They are great people. But they know we have a problem. They know we have a real problem. \u2018Cause something is going on. And we can\u2019t put up with it, folks.   \u2026     \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.   \u2026     Where the hatred comes from and why  \u2014   we\u2019ll have to determine, we\u2019re going to have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can\u2019t live like this. It\u2019s going to get worse and worse. You\u2019re going to have more World Trade Centers.   \u2026    \u201d Throughout the campaign, Trump supporters tried in vain to explain the   \u201cMuslim ban\u201d to a hostile media dead set on interpreting everything out of Trump\u2019s mouth in the ugliest possible way. For example, our general policy on Muslim immigration would be \u201cNo, thanks!\u201d but there would be exceptions. So Charles Krauthammer can stop worrying about King Abdullah of Jordan. In March, Trump supporter Andy Dean told a dense CNN anchor: He\u2019s talking about the culture of Islam in the Middle East.   \u2026     We love Muslims in America and they love us. Why? We have a great culture that respects women\u2019s rights.   \u2026     The thing about Muslims in the Middle East is they don\u2019t respect women\u2019s rights. If a woman wants to get a divorce in the Middle East, that woman could be killed. If you want to leave the religion of Islam in the Middle East, you can be killed. It\u2019s very real. To the same blockhead anchor, Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany had to fill in an edited quote the network had just shown of Trump: It\u2019s important to know what happened 15 seconds later. Anderson Cooper said to him, \u201cAre you speaking of radical Islam or are you speaking of Islam?\u201d He said radical sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell the difference, though. So he did say radical Islam. He said it repeatedly during his campaign. He said, \u201cI have Muslim friends. I love the Muslim people. \u201d   \u2026     One of Trump\u2019s vast number of   supporters told HLN\u2019s Drew Pinksy: I love what (Trump) is doing with the Muslims getting out of the country, because if they really knew what that was about  \u2014   if they knew that that was about freedom. It was about freedom versus enslavement. He\u2019s right. It\u2019s not about religion. It\u2019s not about nationality. It\u2019s about hitting the pause button on bringing in radical Islam\u2019s dysfunctional, misogynist, violent,   culture. The voters understood Trump. (At least some of us did  \u2014   barely enough of us to elect him president!) Liberals didn\u2019t. But now the courts are blocking Trump\u2019s exercise of presidential powers based on the left\u2019s own idiotic misinterpretations of what he said.'"}, "time": 1742564221.209042}
