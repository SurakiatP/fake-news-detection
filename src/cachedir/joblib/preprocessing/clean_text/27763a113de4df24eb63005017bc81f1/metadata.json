Is this a good idea? Here\u2019s the thing. Many people don\u2019t expect to keep their phones for much longer than two years. For the most part, experts say, those people are not going to notice much damage to their phone batteries before they start hankering for a new device. If that sounds like you, feel free to charge every night, and as often as you like in between. But frequent charging takes a toll on the   batteries in our phones. And it\u2019s not because they can be overcharged, said Edo Campos, a spokesman for Anker, which produces phone chargers. \u201cSmartphones are, in fact, smart,\u201d Mr. Campos said. \u201cThey know when to stop charging. \u201d Android phones and iPhones are equipped with chips that protect them from absorbing excess electrical current once they are fully charged. So in theory, any damage from charging your phone overnight with an official charger, or a trustworthy   charger, should be negligible. But the act of charging is itself bad for your phone\u2019s battery. Most phones make use of a technology that allows their batteries to accept more current faster. Hatem Zeine, the founder, chief scientist and chief technical officer of the wireless charging company Ossia, says the technology enables phones to adjust to the amount of charge that a charger is capable of supplying. The technology allows power to pulse into the battery in specific modulations, increasing the speed at which the lithium ions in the battery travel from one side to the other and causing the battery to charge more quickly. But this process also leads   (and  ) batteries to corrode faster than they otherwise would. \u201cWhen you charge fast all the time, you limit the life span of the battery,\u201d Mr. Zeine said. If you\u2019re intent on preserving a   battery beyond the lifetime of the typical phone or tablet, Mr. Zeine suggested using a charger meant for a less powerful device, though he couldn\u2019t guarantee that it would work. \u201cFor example, if you used an iPhone charger on an iPad Pro, it\u2019s going to charge very slowly,\u201d Mr. Zeine said. \u201cIf the electronics are right, they can actually preserve the battery because you\u2019re always charging it slowly. \u201d People looking to preserve their batteries should make sure their phones don\u2019t become overheated, Mr. Campos advised, because high temperatures further excite the   in batteries, leading to even quicker deterioration. Apple\u2019s website says temperatures above 95 degrees Fahrenheit (or 35 Celsius) can \u201cpermanently damage battery capacity. \u201d Both Mr. Zeine and Mr. Campos noted that given the constant demand for new cellphones, charging overnight might not be a point of great concern for many people. \u201cAll this actually doesn\u2019t make a huge difference for consumers,\u201d Mr. Campos said, citing a 2015 Gallup survey showing that 44 percent of smartphone users planned to upgrade their devices as soon as their providers allowed it  \u2014   usually after two years, about the length of time it takes for batteries to start showing signs of wear.'"}, "time": 1742628459.0996237}
