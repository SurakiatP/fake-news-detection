Senate voted to confirm her nomination as education secretary. [Last November, President Donald Trump picked DeVos to head the Department of Education. The    businesswoman has survived a concerted effort to stop her nomination, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a historic deciding vote cementing her confirmation.  Among the celebrities denouncing DeVos was Avengers director Joss Whedon, who called her successful confirmation a sign that Congressional Republicans have \u201cdeclared war on our children. \u201d Below is a summary of some of the reaction to DeVos from Hollywood\u2019s leftwing stars. Rejecting DeVos was the GOP\u2019s easiest way to say \u201dMr Prez, let\u2019s take this slow, we got 4 yrs\u201d. Instead they declared war on our children.  \u2014   Joss Whedon (@joss) February 7, 2017,  Elementary math under Betsy DevosQ: Ned and Sheryl each have 4 apples. Who has more apples?
