[The director of CESNUR and leader of the study, Dr. Massimo Introvigne, told Breitbart News that Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world, and the numbers of those affected are staggering.  Christians are targeted primarily for two reasons, Introvigne said, \u201cfirst because their proclamation of peace disturbs more belligerent groups and second, because their social teachings on life, family and poverty are opposed by powerful forces. \u201d While in the past century, atheistic communist regimes were the greatest persecutors of Christians, Introvigne added, the geopolitical landscape has changed considerably since then and the actors have changed as well. While \u201cCommunism\u2019s last salvoes\u201d are still responsible for some   of Christians, Introvigne told Breitbart, \u201cIslamic  \u201d has taken its place as the   agent of persecution. Introvigne\u2019s findings coincide with those of other scholars and human rights groups. According to the 2016 \u201cWorld Watch List,\u201d for example, published by the Open Doors organization, nine out of the top ten countries where Christians suffer \u201cextreme persecution\u201d had populations that are at least 50 percent Muslim. The 2016 report found that \u201cIslamic extremism is by far the most significant persecution engine\u201d of Christians in the world today and that \u201c40 of the 50 countries on the World Watch List are affected by this kind of persecution. \u201d Introvigne told Breitbart that in Nigeria, \u201cover the last 12 years, the most reliable estimates assess at more than 10, 000 the Christians killed by the Islamic   organization Nigeria\u2019s Boko Haram. \u201d Yet while some groups, like Boko Haram, are private organizations, in a number of countries, \u201cpersecution of Christians is actually promoted by the governments,\u201d Introvigne said. \u201cSeveral Muslim countries still have laws punishing apostasy \u2014  converting from Islam to another religion,\u201d he noted. \u201cOthers have laws against blasphemy, and some tend to consider any criticism of Islam as blasphemy. \u201d While tens of thousands of Christians are killed for their faith, Introvigne said, they are just the tip of the iceberg and much persecution takes place on a daily basis that never makes news. CESNUR\u2019s annual study, which is slated for release next month, indicates that between 500 and 600 million Christians were in some way persecuted and prevented from freely practicing their faith.
