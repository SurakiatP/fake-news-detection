Trump\u2019s ghostwriter of \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d seeking insights about Mr. Trump\u2019s deepest insecurities as they devise strategies to needle and undermine him in four weeks at the first presidential debate, the most anticipated in a generation. Her team is also getting advice from psychology experts to help create a personality profile of Mr. Trump to gauge how he may respond to attacks and deal with a woman as his sole adversary on the debate stage. They are undertaking a   analysis of Mr. Trump\u2019s performances in the Republican primary debates, cataloging strengths and weaknesses as well as trigger points that caused him to lash out in    ways. As Mrs. Clinton pores over this voluminous research with her debate team, most recently for several hours on Friday, and her aides continue searching for someone who can rattle her as a Trump   during mock debates, Mr. Trump is taking the opposite tack. Though he spent hours with his debate team the last two Sundays, the sessions were more freewheeling than focused, and he can barely conceal his disdain for laborious and theatrical practice sessions. \u201cI believe you can prep too much for those things,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview last week. \u201cIt can be dangerous. You can sound scripted or phony  \u2014   like you\u2019re trying to be someone you\u2019re not. \u201d Rarely are debate preparations as illuminating about the candidates as a debate itself, but Mrs. Clinton\u2019s and Mr. Trump\u2019s strikingly different approaches to the Sept. 26   are more revealing about their egos and battlefield instincts than most other moments in the campaign. Mrs. Clinton, a deeply competitive debater, wants to crush Mr. Trump on live television, but not with an avalanche of policy details she is searching for ways to bait him into making blunders. Mr. Trump, a supremely confident communicator, wants viewers to see him as a   political outsider and trusts that he can box in Mrs. Clinton on her ethics and honesty. He has been especially resistant to his advisers\u2019 suggestions that he take part in mock debates with a Clinton  . At their first session devoted to the debate, on Aug. 21 at Mr. Trump\u2019s club in Bedminster, N. J. the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham was on hand to offer counsel and, if Mr. Trump was game, to play Mrs. Clinton, said Trump advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the debate preparations were supposed to be kept private. He declined. Instead, Mr. Trump asked a battery of questions about debate topics, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s skills and possible moderators, but people close to him said relatively little had been accomplished. At that gathering, and another in Bedminster on Sunday without Ms. Ingraham, Mr. Trump was joined by Roger Ailes, who was ousted as Fox News chairman last month over accusations of sexual harassment. Mr. Trump, in the interview, said he saw little use in standing at lecterns and pretending to debate his opponent. \u201cI know who I am, and it got me here,\u201d Mr. Trump said, boasting of success in his 11 primary debate appearances and in capturing the Republican nomination over veteran politicians and polished debaters. \u201cI don\u2019t want to present a false front. I mean, it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll do a mock debate, but I don\u2019t see a real need. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s certitude  \u2014   \u201cI know how to handle Hillary,\u201d he said  \u2014   reflects his belief that the debates will be won or lost not on policy points and mastery of details, which are Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strengths, but on the authenticity, boldness and leadership that the nominees demonstrate onstage. Mr. Trump is certain that he holds advantages here, saying Mrs. Clinton is likely to come across as a typical politician spouting rehearsed lines. For Mrs. Clinton, who can appear most at peace with a briefing book in her hand, there is no such thing as too much preparation. She met on Friday with key members of her debate team  \u2014   the longtime Democratic operative Ron Klain, the Washington lawyer Karen Dunn and her senior strategist, Joel Benenson  \u2014   and delved into the campaign\u2019s extensive data on Mr. Trump and the likely questions and themes at the debate, according to two campaign advisers who requested anonymity to reveal internal campaign dynamics. In compiling research to help Mrs. Clinton prepare, her advisers have cast a wide net. They contacted Tony Schwartz, the \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d   to give them advice about Mr. Trump this summer  \u2014   even though Mr. Schwartz\u2019s   immersion in Mr. Trump\u2019s life and homes ended in the  . But Clinton advisers said Mr. Schwartz and other writers who had observed Mr. Trump up close, as well as unnamed psychology experts they had spoken to, were critical to understanding how to get under Mr. Trump\u2019s skin. These Clinton advisers agree with Mr. Trump\u2019s belief that the debate will not be remembered as pitting a policy expert against a Washington outsider. Instead, her campaign is preparing ways for her to unnerve Mr. Trump and provoke him to rant and rave. The Clinton camp believes that Mr. Trump is most insecure about his intelligence, his net worth and his image as a successful businessman, and those are the areas they are working with Mrs. Clinton to target. Mr. Schwartz, in an interview, declined to comment about any conversations with the Clinton campaign, but he said Mr. Trump would be vulnerable if Mrs. Clinton proved to be calm, deliberate and relentless in attacking Mr. Trump\u2019s character, volatility and readiness to be commander in chief. \u201cTrump has severe attention problems and simply cannot take in complex information  \u2014   he will be unable to practice for these debates,\u201d said Mr. Schwartz, who was the subject of a New Yorker profile last month that portrayed Mr. Trump as a charlatan. \u201cTrump will bring nothing but his bluster to the debates. He\u2019ll use   language, he will repeat himself many times, he won\u2019t complete sentences, and he won\u2019t say anything of substance. \u201d \u201cEven so,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said, \u201cClinton has to be careful  \u2014   she could get everything right and still potentially lose the debates if she comes off as too condescending, too much of a   . \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers plan to have one person prepare extensively to play Mr. Trump in a series of mock   in the days before the first debate, which will be held at Hofstra University on Long Island. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team is also taking a hard look at her vulnerabilities. Even supporters have often questioned the clarity and wisdom of the campaign\u2019s responses to uproars over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server and donations to the Clinton Foundation. There is hope that the debate stage will allow her a chance to at last address such questions with more brevity and less equivocation. The least comfortable task, though, will most likely be girding for personal attacks from Mr. Trump, who has shown an eagerness to resuscitate Clinton scandals  \u2014   real and imagined  \u2014   at virtually every opportunity. Allies have insisted that Mrs. Clinton will not shy away from preparing for the most painful insults, including a possible focus on her husband\u2019s infidelities. \u201cShe knows that it\u2019s coming,\u201d said Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor and a member of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s transition planning team. Mr. Trump said in the interview that he would \u201crather not\u201d attack Mrs. Clinton on personal grounds, including Bill Clinton\u2019s extramarital affairs. \u201cIf she hits me, though  \u2014   you have to see what happens,\u201d Mr. Trump said. It was this unpredictability that often made Mr. Trump an elusive target for fellow Republicans in the primary debates, and some close to Mrs. Clinton expressed concern that any false charges from Mr. Trump could rankle her. \u201cThis is a special challenge for Hillary, who is deeply rooted in the   world,\u201d said Paul Begala, who helped prepare Mr. Clinton for debates in 1992 and 1996. \u201cShe is more wonk than pol, so she might be especially frustrated by a steady stream of invective, conspiracy theories and lies. \u201d Around the Clinton campaign, the question of whom to cast as Mr. Trump has become something of a running parlor game. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies have floated several options: Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, who is from Queens, where Mr. Trump grew up James Carville, Mr. Clinton\u2019s chief strategist in 1992, who has a gift for lacerating banter or Mark Cuban, another billionaire businessman. All three are viewed as unafraid to say some humiliating things to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s face, as Mr. Trump may. At least a few old Clinton hands have suggested enlisting professional entertainers, like Jon Stewart or Alec Baldwin. Mr. Trump\u2019s search so far seems to be less exhaustive: He said his daughter Ivanka could end up playing Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWouldn\u2019t she be great at that?\u201d Mr. Trump asked. \u201cMaybe. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628458.0998664}
