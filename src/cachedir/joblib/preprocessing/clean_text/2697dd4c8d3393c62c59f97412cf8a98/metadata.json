Or does he truly know something most of us don\u2019t know? \\nIn a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have \u201cbribed electoral college representatives\u201d in a bid to \u201cfix\u201d the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed . \\nAdams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country \u2013 some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already. \\nSoros also funds left-wing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer \u201cagitators\u201d at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters (acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump ). \\nBut aren\u2019t electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector\u2019s district? No, they\u2019re not. Nine-nine percent of electors have done what they\u2019re supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election \\nPer Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories: State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties. \\nIn the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesn\u2019t require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may \u201cextract pledges from electors to vote for the parties\u2019 nominees,\u201d Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that \u201cfaithless electors\u201d could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector. \\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged,\u201d said Archives.gov. \\nThe site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and it\u2019s no ordinary election . And Democrats (and the establishment media) have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans don\u2019t want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldn\u2019t balk at or challenge the buying off of electors. Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742564072.2919233}
