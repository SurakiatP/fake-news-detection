[Comedienne Kathy Griffin and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper kicked off the bizarre sequence of events by debating whether Lemon should get a tattoo or have his ear pierced.  \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin asked Lemon, who was reporting live from New Orleans. \u201cNipples! Nipples! Nipples!\u201d Griffin screamed suggested a nipple piercing, as Lemon began to unbutton his shirt. He eventually settled on getting his ear pierced. \u201cIs this going to hurt?\u201d a tequila   Lemon asked Chris, an   tattoo artist who was hold a piercing gun in his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to hurt me,\u201d Chris said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. \u201d \u201cMama Lemon,\u201d a seemingly embarrassed Baldwin said, while looking into the camera,\u201d I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking. At least it\u2019s just his ear, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d After the needled was in and Lemon was sporting a fleur de lis earring, Baldwin said \u201cthis is what happens when a lot of tequila happens. \u201d About 30 minutes later, as the clock struck midnight and the New Year had finally arrived, Lemon (now drinking champagne) began to rebuke 2016. \u201cI can\u2019t hear a damn thing,\u201d Lemon said. \u201cSo, 2016 was awful,\u201d he added just before his microphone was abruptly cut off.  What exactly was so \u201cawful\u201d about 2016, we may never know. But perhaps CNN cut off Lemon\u2019s mic because it didn\u2019t want to relive the public relations nightmare it endured last month after one of the network\u2019s producers was heard offscreen joking about the possibility of   Donald Trump\u2019s plane crashing. And, of course, 2016 was the year Lemon was called \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d by none other than Trump. . @dbongino  You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN. Don Lemon is a lightweight  \u2014   dumb as a rock,  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2016,  Oddly though, in a year where CNN had seen steep ratings declines and had been dubbed the \u201cClinton News Network,\u201d Lemon\u2019s   antics received rave reviews on social media as #drunkdonlemon trended online. CNN needs to be cutting to #DrunkDonLemon every 10 minutes, if not 5. #CNNNYE,  \u2014   Ashleigh Virginia (@ashvirginia_) January 1, 2017,  Don Lemon wasted on @CNN getting his ear pierced in a bar is the perfect way to end 2016. #DrunkDonLemon,  \u2014   Tim Baker\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\\u200d\ud83d\udcbb (@IAmTimBaker) January 1, 2017,  Honestly, #drunkdonlemon is the best thing ever on TV. 2016 finally gave us a solid.  \u2014   Nicole McDaniel (@nicoleann75) January 1, 2017,  Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742564111.1152692}
