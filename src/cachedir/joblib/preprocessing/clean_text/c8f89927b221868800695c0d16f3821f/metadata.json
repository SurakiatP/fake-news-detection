[\u201cParliament notes with concern that today there are areas in Denmark where the number of immigrants from   countries and their descendants is over 50 percent,\u201d the resolution states.  \u201cIt is parliament\u2019s opinion that Danes should not be a minority in residential areas in Denmark. \u201d Denmark, like many other European countries, saw a surge in sexual assaults and harassment by migrants after they began to arrive in large numbers. Rafi Ibrahim, a Syrian who has been settled in Denmark for many years, told reporters that the new arrivals find it difficult to control themselves around Western women. \u201cIf they see a girl, they go nuts. They simply can\u2019t handle it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Syria and many other countries, it is not normal for a strange woman to smile at you. Those girls who are harassed aren\u2019t necessarily   or drunk. Sometimes it is enough just to be a girl. \u201d Danish immigration minister Inger St\u00f8jberg confessed in late 2016 that \u201cintegration in Denmark has failed\u201d following a damning report on criminality and unemployment in   increasingly   ghettoes. \u201cIn my opinion it is because we have been too scared to set out clear demands to the people coming to Denmark,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have not dared to say that we expect and demand that they provide for themselves and their families, and that we expect them to adjust to Danish values. \u201d Indigenous Britons were officially recorded as a minority in the nation\u2019s capital for the first time in 2011, with just 44. 9 per cent of Londoners identifying as \u201cWhite British\u201d in the 2011 census. White Britons are also under 50 per cent of the population in Leicester, Luton, and Slough, with Manchester University researchers predicting that Birmingham, the UK\u2019s second city, will soon follow suit.'"}, "time": 1742563328.9152112}
