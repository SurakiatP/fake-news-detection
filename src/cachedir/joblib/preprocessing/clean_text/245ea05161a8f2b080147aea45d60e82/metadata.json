At some point before I moved in, someone had neatly tacked sheets to the ceiling to hide, I don\u2019t know, probably a really terrible ceiling. I shared the place, a poor excuse for a   in Little Italy, with a roommate, so it was larger than Marnie\u2019s 250 square feet. The biggest difference was I lived there in 1999, when everyone was busy watching Carrie Bradshaw bound up the picturesque steps of her Upper East Side brownstone on \u201cSex and the City. \u201d Remember her   closet? What freelancer has a   closet? Even then, I knew it was absurd. But I could will myself to believe in it, because my friends could still afford to live in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Fort Greene, Brooklyn, where the telltale markers of gentrification  \u2014   construction cranes,    restaurants and soaring rents  \u2014   had yet to take hold. But the real estate landscape has shifted so profoundly over the last two decades that this generation\u2019s    occupies a very different kind of space. And it is one that keeps shrinking, which is why Desi, Marnie\u2019s hapless husband, frantically builds a wall down the middle of Marnie\u2019s tiny studio to try to save their crumbling marriage. \u201cWelcome to your new   apartment,\u201d he says, to her horror. As rising rents squeeze young New Yorkers, the TV apartment has become grittier, dirtier and ever more cramped. You could almost say it is angry. A generation ago, Carrie could whine about the size of a closet in a $   apartment in the episode where she goes apartment hunting after being threatened with eviction. \u201cI pay $750 for something that\u2019s twice the size!\u201d she laments. The broker is unmoved. Carrie, of course, has what most New Yorkers could only dream about, then and now: a   apartment. Now we have Abbi on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cBroad City,\u201d   with Pam, the broker in a neck brace. Abbi\u2019s options include \u201ca beautiful   apartment in your budget\u201d that is bright green, has no bathroom and might actually be a hallway. But it sure beats the place with the   walls. \u201cYou guys know that television show \u2018Friends?\u2019 \u201d Pam asks as she jimmies the door with a penknife. \u201cHere\u2019s this place. \u201d What Abbi finds inside is the antithesis of the \u201cFriends\u201d apartment: austere, soulless and stark white, except, of course, for the blood spatter, remnants of an apparent double murder. \u201cMore good news! The walls are super thick,\u201d Pam says. As you will recall, the \u201cFriends\u201d apartment, shared by a young barista and a struggling chef, was a palatial   with amusing purple walls in the West Village. Even in 1994, few of us were fooled by the \u201cFriends\u201d fantasy, but we ran with it anyway. Television has become smarter since then  \u2014   viewers expect more rawness. Well, maybe they expect more truth. It just happens to be raw. But dig deeper and shows like \u201cBroad City\u201d and \u201cGirls\u201d tell a different    story, one that is experienced in the shadow of the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. The characters on these shows are part of a generation burdened by student loan debt and stagnating wages. Netflix\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d doesn\u2019t get a place with a   balcony in the happening West Village. For her, there\u2019s a grim garden apartment reached by a dicey set of steps in far Greenpoint, Brooklyn. \u201cYounger generations are having to face this reality,\u201d said Lindsay T. Graham, a psychologist at the Center for the Built Environment at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWhen you see shows where the characters are existing in these sorts of struggles, I think that that\u2019s actually comforting. \u201d We\u2019ve traded crown molding for blooming mold in the bathroom. Furniture is worn and stained. None of the throw pillows match. \u201cWe make sure there\u2019s no bedbugs and then we use it,\u201d said Angelique Clark, \u201cBroad City\u2019s\u201d production designer, about choosing furnishings for the set. The walls have been painted countless times, and Abbi definitely did not choose the puke green of the hallway wall of her   apartment in Astoria, Queens. But the grime and the lack of space are the point. At a rent party that Abbi\u2019s friend Ilana hosts, she trips over her guests as she tries to shield them from the rats that have overrun her      in Gowanus, Brooklyn. \u201cWe were just trying to capture a New York that was more realistic to us,\u201d Ilana Glazer told me during a phone call with Abbi Jacobson, her \u201cBroad City\u201d   and  . \u201cWe crack up looking at the \u2018Friends\u2019 set. It\u2019s like a play, facing the audience. \u201d Although Marnie\u2019s studio in Chinatown could have been modeled on my sad pad, its inspiration was an apartment the show\u2019s art director once rented. \u201cPeople can watch and be like, \u2018Oh, yeah, I had an apartment like that,\u2019 \u201d said Matt Munn, the production designer for \u201cGirls. \u201d New York has never been kind to young people just starting out. But in recent years, it has become downright cruel. In early 1996, when \u201cFriends\u201d was in its second season, the median rent in Manhattan was $2, 000 a month. Over the next 20 years, it jumped 67 percent to $3, 344 a month in early 2016, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. But while that may seem like an enormous increase, adjust those numbers for inflation, and the median rent in 1996 would have been $3, 645 a month, or 9 percent more than it is today. \u201cRents are actually somewhat lower than they were in the mid 1990s,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cBut because wages have leveled off, it doesn\u2019t feel that way. \u201d Young people between the ages of 18 and 29 earned about 20 percent less in real wages in 2014 than they would have earned in 2000, according to a report by the city comptroller. Also, Brooklyn  \u2014   at least the parts seen as hip alternatives to Manhattan  \u2014   is no longer cheaper. The flow of young professionals looking for housing led to a   rise in rents in those areas, while displacing many of the people who were living there. Consider Williamsburg, the epicenter of Brooklyn gentrification. A 1996 New York Times article about the neighborhood reported that rent for a   started at around $700 a month. According to Mr. Miller, the minimum starting rent for a   is now around $1, 832 a month. Grim reality brings us to \u201cThe Holdouts,\u201d a web series about a grumpy guy named Kevin who lives in a rundown   apartment in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. It is described as \u201ca comedy about New Yorkers who can\u2019t afford to live in New York anymore. \u201d The concept appears to have struck a nerve. It took less than a month for the creators to raise $35, 790 on Kickstarter in June to begin producing episodes. Filming began this month, and next month we will be able to watch the pilot episode in which Kevin resists his landlord\u2019s overtures to buy him out. \u201cHe is living in the past,\u201d Stephen Girasuolo, one of the show\u2019s creators, said of Kevin. \u201cYou could sort of say, \u2018Dude, maybe you should sort of let it go.\u2019 \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563514.8583958}
