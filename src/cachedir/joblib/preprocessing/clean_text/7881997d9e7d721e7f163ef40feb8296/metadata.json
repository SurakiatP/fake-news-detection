[In a post about the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria, PolitiFact admitted, \u201cThe outcry leads us to revisit a 2014 claim from former Secretary of State John Kerry. \u201d  \u201cKerry said in a television interview that in Syria, \u2018we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out.\u2019 Syria had agreed in 2013 to an ambitious program to destroy its chemical stockpiles under international supervision, as part of a deal brokered by Russia,\u201d they explained. \u201cWhen Kerry spoke in July 2014, the process seemed far along. Based on reports from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  \u2014   which later won the Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts  \u2014   we rated that claim Mostly True.

In a 2013 report, The Weekly Standard claimed that Politifact \u201chas it out for Republicans\u201d after they overwhelmingly focused more on   arguments made by conservatives than Democrats, even spinning jokes made by Republicans into facts. During the 2016 presidential election, Politifact also rated just 15% of Trump\u2019s campaign claims as \u201ctrue\u201d against a 51% rating for Clinton and spun stories to benefit Clinton and criticize Donald Trump.
