Below is an excerpt from Push Your Way to Purpose.  Purpose consumes me. It always has. Who are you? Why are you? What will you? I began contemplating those questions when I was a young girl sitting in my bedroom and staring at pictures of music and television icons taped to my wall. But it started long before that. I entered the world with a mandate on my life. It was spoken. It was so. But I didn\u2019t know.   I always had a feeling that something larger was calling me, though, which made little sense, considering that I lived in rather ordinary surroundings. The projects of the Bronx don\u2019t exactly conjure up images of greatness. Later, after I moved to Long Island, a bright future may have seemed more likely to the onlooker \u2014  like I was getting closer to the possibility of greatness, but even as I daydreamed, there was a nagging longing for more. But how would I make it happen? Isn\u2019t that the question everyone asks? If you think not, think again. By 11, children have already begun wondering what their purpose is. By 40, adults have begun wondering if they missed theirs. We\u2019re all consumed with purpose. Your neighbors are. Your   are. You are. We may not recognize it, but it\u2019s there \u2014  in the words we speak, the decisions we make, even the friends we keep. Everything points back to purpose and our longing for it.  What are the odds that we will fulfill our purpose, though? The answer has everything to do with identity, being able to recognize who we truly are. Unfortunately, many never come to this revelation. As a result, they live beneath themselves. Even those seemingly on top of the world struggle with identity.   I am writing this book because I have a message to share, one that will help you understand that there\u2019s more waiting \u2014  for you. No matter how low you\u2019ve fallen or how high you\u2019ve climbed, you\u2019re marked for more.  This isn\u2019t one of those name it, claim it, blab it, grab it, sprinkle a little dust, and you can have it   books meant to pump you up with hot air. Those books do pump you up, right before dropping you \u2014  on your head. This book doesn\u2019t tell you that reaching the place you were meant to be is    easy. In fact, it tells you the opposite. Some of it is difficult, but all of it is doable. My experiences provide keys to unlock the doors to your destiny and introduce you to   principles. My book is called Push Your Way to Purpose for a reason. Let\u2019s just say the title also has a purpose. \u201cPush\u201d is a verb. Verbs are action words. You have to become a verb to grasp what the book\u2019s subtitle promises to teach you: How to Get from Where You Are to Where You\u2019re Meant to Be.  Nobody wants to push anymore. We want everything to be easy. But easy doesn\u2019t bring us to destiny. I don\u2019t believe it was supposed to be as hard as we have made it, though. God created us with basic instructions: BE. But \u201cbut\u201d got in the way. We \u201cbut\u201d  our way out of \u201cbe,\u201d making excuses for being everything other than our best, and we made messes along the way. Some messes look like successes, while other messes can\u2019t hide. Some people are so far down they can\u2019t even imagine up. But most of the people we encounter are just your ordinary,      people. They\u2019re not at rock bottom, and they\u2019re not soaring on the clouds. They\u2019re average, working, normal people. They\u2019re parents, teachers, students, friends. They\u2019re community members you see in the supermarket. They run for elected office. They change diapers. They\u2019re you. They\u2019re me.   So we\u2019re in this together. We each have a purpose, and we can discover it, then fulfill it. It will require effort, a willingness never to settle for less than who we are meant to be. It may also require swallowing our egos if we think we have it all together and embracing our potential if we think we have nothing together. Wherever we sit on that spectrum, let us get up, raise our expectations, believe for more, and push our way to purpose. It\u2019s time. \u201cName her Adrienne because she\u2019s going to be a schoolteacher. \u201d I\u2019ve shared this story more times than I can count, and for good reason: by the time I\u2019m done telling the story, it always garners the desired response. What is that story, and what is the response? That\u2019s the purpose of this chapter. It\u2019s a perfect place to start because it sets the stage for the focus of this book.  Everyone wants to be successful. Everyone wants to believe that she was, in fact, born to be successful, that the   adage is true for her life: \u201cThe sky is the limit. \u201d Some would bet the farm \u2014  or the   \u2014  on it. It sounds good, doesn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s not true, or at least it\u2019s not necessarily true. Like most things, it must be made to be true. You have to grab it and make it true in your life. The sky very well may be the limit, but so may the floor. It all depends on the level of your reach, the things you\u2019ve chosen to embrace, the relationships you have \u2014  and have not \u2014  fostered. All these and more figure into your limit. You may be one of those whose life seems to be without limits, or you may be one who seemingly cannot catch a break. It could go either way because while there are circumstances that are beyond our control and    sometimes just happens, very often, the thing that happens to us is us.  One thing influencing our level of success is what we hear. When I say \u201chear,\u201d I mean \u201clisten to. \u201d Many words bump into my ear in the course of a day, but I don\u2019t feed off of them all. There\u2019s a huge difference between what I hear well enough to repeat and what I listen to and choose to eat \u2014  to digest. I decide. And it makes all the difference in the world.
