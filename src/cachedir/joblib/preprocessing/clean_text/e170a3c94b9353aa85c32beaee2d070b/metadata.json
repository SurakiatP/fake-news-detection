Likewise in the interests of truth, all images of new possessions will now be accompanied by scans of the various debtor agency letters, credit card warnings and the inevitable divorce certificate. \\n\u2018Identifying \u201cthe truth\u201d is actually quite difficult in an algorithm-driven environment,\u2019 explained CEO Mark Zuckerber. \u2018But anyone could see that the shots of this happy couple on a beach in Marbella were entirely bogus, considering the discovery of her clandestine affair, and his ongoing problem drinking.\u2019 \\nUnfortunately Facebook is awash with liars \u2013 like holier-than-thou Animal Rights supporters who secretly scoff burgers. Or staged images of \u2018angelic\u2019 grandchildren \u2013 who off camera are referred to as \u2018snotty little shits\u2019 who talk through the soaps. The same with sunset views of shapely legs; they are just photo-shopped knees, which normally resemble a pair of bowling bowls \u2018lost in a sausage factory\u2019. \\nAnticipating a serious loss of revenue from lack of usership, Zuckerberg has announced plans for \u2018FuckOffBook\u2019\u2013 catering to the new straight-talking age of Brexit and Trump. It will encourage \u2018honest\u2019 discourse between new users with faeces and middle finger emojis. \u2018We will not rest in our commitment to ending the scourge of fake news. And that\u2019s as sure as Hillary Clinton ordered 9/11, and President Elect Trump won the popular vote.\u2019 Dr Turmoil & SJ Roe (team effort!)
