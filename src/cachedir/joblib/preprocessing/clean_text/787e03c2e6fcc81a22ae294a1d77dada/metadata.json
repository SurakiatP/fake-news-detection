[The classic dark blue design, which was replaced by   passports in 1988 to comply with EU policy of a single European passport, could be   as soon as 2019, with a range of contractors currently bidding for its production.  In 2007, the European Union sought to further dilute the passport\u2019s individuality by insisting that the words \u201cHer Britannic Majesty,\u201d were removed from the first page. Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, who is chairman of the Parliamentary Flags and Heraldry Committee said: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of identity. Having the pink European passports has been a source of humiliation. It merged us into one European identity, which isn\u2019t what we are. \u201d \u201cThe old dark blue design was a distinct, clear and bold statement of what it means to be British, which is just what our citizens need as they travel abroad after Brexit,\u201d he continued. The current contract with passport manufacturers De La Rue expires with the British government in 2019, with the Home Office now accepting proposals from companies to manage \u00a3490 million redesign project. Other priorities for the government\u2019s new design will include incorporating new mechanisms to combat identity fraud. Responding to the news, a Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are launching the procurement process now to ensure there is sufficient time to produce and design UK passports from 2019 when the current contract ends. \u201d The issue of the British passport was one frequently mentioned by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who pointed out that as well as having the words \u2018European Union\u2019 on the front, it also guarantees British citizenship rights for all 500 million EU citizens.
