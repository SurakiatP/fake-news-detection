[\u201cPaul Ryan and Donald Trump tried forcing through the worst legislation for women in a generation,\u201d Richards says. \u201cThey were   on stripping health care from 24 million people, cutting essentials like maternity care, and blocking women from getting care at Planned Parenthood health centers. \u201d  Because people organized and spoke out, tomorrow 8, 118 people will be able to get care at Planned Parenthood health centers across America.  \u2014   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 24, 2017,  Great to have so many women\u2019s health experts around the table discussing ending maternity coverage  blocking access to Planned Parenthood. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 23, 2017,  For awhile, Planned Parenthood was touting its \u201cprenatal services. \u201d Once it was realized what these services were  \u2014   for the most part, \u201cfake news\u201d  \u2014   the abortion chain began boasting about its \u201cmaternity care,\u201d largely to justify its more than half a billion dollars annually in taxpayer funding.  \u201cThe reality is, Planned Parenthood does zero mammograms, performs less than two percent of women\u2019s cancer screenings in the U. S. offers virtually no prenatal care, yet does over a third of the nation\u2019s abortions  \u2014   887 abortions every day,\u201d says Lila Rose, president of national   group Live Action. Rose\u2019s organization recently released another investigative video in which Planned Parenthood staff members throughout the country are repeatedly heard informing the investigator that their clinics do not offer \u201cprenatal care. \u201d \u201cLive Action\u2019s recent investigation has shown that women wanting to keep their children who were seeking prenatal care at Planned Parenthoods across the country were consistently turned away, despite Planned Parenthood\u2019s claims that its federal funding goes toward prenatal care,\u201d Rose says. \u201cWhen subsequently asked, the abortion chain has refused to tell the media how many of its centers actually provide prenatal care. \u201d In her email message, Richards says to her supporters, \u201cYour strength was far greater than theirs. The unprecedented grassroots energy from you and the entire Planned Parenthood community helped stop this bill from even leaving the House. \u201d \u201cThe incredible support of the Planned Parenthood community just made all the difference in stopping this dangerous bill right now,\u201d she adds. \u201cOur voices together are loud enough to drown out the   politicians  \u2014   and we\u2019ll need you with us for whatever comes next. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561723.181212}
