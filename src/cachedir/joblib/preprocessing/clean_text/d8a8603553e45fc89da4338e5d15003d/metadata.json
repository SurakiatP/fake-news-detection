Just in the last few years, China has built  islands topped with military bases to back its claim to vast stretches of ocean, in conflict with half a dozen other Asian countries, while Russia has forged a path of bloodshed and destruction in Ukraine over its annexation of Crimea. But that\u2019s not how Canada and Denmark roll. Their way of contesting ownership of an uninhabited island in the Arctic would better suit a dinner party than a battlefield: It comes down to B. Y. O. B. Hans Island is really just a large rock, but it happens to lie smack dab in the middle of the Nares Strait, a    channel of very cold water separating Canada and Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. The island falls within the   territorial limit of either shore, allowing both sides to claim it under international law. Canada and Denmark set out to establish a definitive border through the strait in 1973, but they couldn\u2019t agree on what to do about Hans Island, so they left the issue aside to be resolved later. The calm diplomatic waters grew choppy in 1984 when Canadian troops visited the island, planted their nation\u2019s flag and left another symbolic marker as well: a bottle of Canadian whisky. The Danes couldn\u2019t let that stand. The country\u2019s minister of Greenland affairs soon arrived on the island to replace the offending Canadian symbols with a Danish flag and a bottle of Danish schnapps, along with a note saying \u201cWelcome to the Danish island. \u201d And so began a spirited dispute, one that has lasted decades, with each side dropping by the island periodically to scoop up the other side\u2019s patriotic bottle and replace it with their own. (What becomes of the evicted liquor? No one is  \u2014   hic  \u2014   saying.) Canada and Denmark agreed in 2005 on a process to resolve the status of Hans Island, but the diplomats have made little headway since then. Hoping to encourage the negotiations, two academics put forward a proposal in 2015 to blend realpolitik with real estate: Make the island a \u201ccondominium\u201d of shared sovereignty under two flags  \u2014   and presumably, two bottles.'"}, "time": 1742563879.6589046}
