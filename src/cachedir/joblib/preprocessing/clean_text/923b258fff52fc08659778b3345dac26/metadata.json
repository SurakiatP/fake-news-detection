The device is still in development and field trials are due to begin in 2017. \\nThe exoskeleton reduces the need of carrying heavy batteries. \\nSputnik reports: \\n\u201c Just by walking, soldiers could generate power,\u201d the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center\u2019s Project Engineer Noel Soto said in the release. \u201cWe are converting the movement of the knees when you walk into useful power. \u201c \\n\u201cThe goal is to reduce the amount of batteries used by soldiers, or to be able to extend the mission with the same load,\u201d Soto noted. \u201cSoldiers are carrying a heavy load and a lot of that weight, 16 to 20 pounds for a 72-hour mission, is due to batteries.\u201d \\nSoldiers now carry multiple electronic devices that aid in strategy, communication and navigation, including computers, radios, mobile phones, battlefield situational displays and navigation tools, according to the release.'"}, "time": 1742562138.6727574}
