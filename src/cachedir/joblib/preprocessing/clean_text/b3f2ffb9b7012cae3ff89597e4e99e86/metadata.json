But for The Daily Mail, one of Britain\u2019s most popular newspapers, the question that mattered was: Which leader had better legs? \u201cNever mind Brexit, who won  !\u201d its cover on Tuesday blared. Many readers were appalled that the encounter between Theresa May, the prime minister, and Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, had been reduced to a comparison of their bodies. By Tuesday afternoon, at least one complaint had been filed with Britain\u2019s press regulator. \u201cThis is 2017,\u201d Chuka Umunna, a Labour lawmaker, wrote on Twitter. \u201cSexist does not begin to describe this front page. \u201d Others, perhaps more jaded, were unsurprised, given how The Daily Mail has represented women in its pages in the past. \u201cThe Daily Mail do this regularly,\u201d said Roy Greenslade, a professor of journalism at City University in London and a columnist for the liberal newspaper The Guardian. \u201cAnd this is a particularly venal example, but if you look at it day on day, there are plenty of similar examples. \u201d Professor Greenslade said the blatant sexism was done unapologetically, \u201cwith a sense of confidence on the understanding that they can\u2019t see what the fuss is all about. \u201d Mrs. May and Ms. Sturgeon met at a hotel in Glasgow on Monday, two days before the British government was set to invoke Article 50, formally notifying the European Union of Britain\u2019s intention to leave the bloc. The leaders stopped for a photograph, sitting next to each other in armchairs. \u201cBut what stands out here are the legs  \u2014   and the vast expanse on show,\u201d Sarah Vine, the author of the Daily Mail article, wrote. Ms. Vine is married to Michael Gove, the British politician who helped lead the campaign to leave the European Union. The article went on to describe each woman\u2019s stance. \u201cKnees tightly together,\u201d Mrs. May opted for \u201ca studied pose that reminds us that for all her confidence, she is ever the vicar\u2019s daughter,\u201d the article said. Ms. Sturgeon\u2019s legs, described as \u201cundeniably more shapely shanks,\u201d were \u201cmore flirty, tantalizingly crossed. \u201d The writer then called the Scottish leader\u2019s posture \u201ca direct attempt at seduction: Her stiletto is not quite dangling off her foot, but it could be. \u201d The Daily Mail has a readership of about 3. 4 million. It has often portrayed what it calls \u201ccareer women\u201d through the lens of their appearance, rather than through their accomplishments. \u201cEven though they are great champions of Theresa May  \u2014   and were champions of Mrs. Thatcher  \u2014   they still basically see women in a 1950s role, as an adornment,\u201d Professor Greenslade said, referring to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \u201cThat\u2019s why so much of their editorial is about how women look. \u201d In 2014, for example, The Daily Mail compiled photographs of female lawmakers entering or leaving 10 Downing Street, the prime minister\u2019s office and residence, during meetings about a cabinet reshuffle by David Cameron, Mrs. May\u2019s predecessor. The article, with the headline \u201cEsther, the Queen of the Downing Street Catwalk,\u201d referring to one of the lawmakers, Esther McVey, also caused an uproar. To the latest criticism, The Daily Mail issued the response \u201cFor goodness sake, get a life!\u201d Its statement called the article \u201ca sidebar alongside a serious political story\u201d that appeared \u201cin an   paper packed with important news and analysis. \u201d The statement added that the newspaper had backed Mrs. May when she ran to succeed Mr. Cameron as leader of the governing Conservative Party. The newspaper added that it had often commented on the appearance of politicians, including \u201cMr. Cameron\u2019s waistline\u201d the hair of the former chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne and the attire of Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party. If the statement reflected a certain sensitivity to the negative coverage, so did later versions of the front page. Observers noted that it was tweaked in print, for a later edition, to add the words: \u201cSarah Vine\u2019s lighthearted verdict on the big showdown. \u201d Some critics said that the adjustment was itself sexist, as it appeared to shift attention to the writer. \u201cI think people maybe have had a slight sense of humor failure,\u201d said Ms. Vine, speaking on the BBC radio show \u201cWorld at One. \u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is creating a more approachable version of the story,\u201d she added. Ms. Vine also defended the cover change, saying she stood by what she had written. Professor Greenslade saw the late change in the cover language as a belated attempt to   a controversy. \u201cIt is a pretty pathetic excuse,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you see that front page, it\u2019s quite clear what they meant: Don\u2019t worry about the politics, just look at the legs. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564577.2352571}
