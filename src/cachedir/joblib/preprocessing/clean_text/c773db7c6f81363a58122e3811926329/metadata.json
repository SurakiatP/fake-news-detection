President Trump\u2019s harangues against the American news media appear to have inspired a new genre of commentary in China\u2019s state media, whose propagandists spiced up social media posts and news articles with Trumpian flourishes this week. People\u2019s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, mimicked Mr. Trump\u2019s characteristic bluster  \u2014   and his fondness for capital letters  \u2014   on Friday in denouncing Western news coverage of a Chinese lawyer and human rights advocate who said he had been tortured. An article on the topic a day earlier by Xinhua, the   news agency, had accused the foreign news media of \u201chype\u201d and suggested that legal activists were manipulating the press to \u201csmear the Chinese government. \u201d \u201cThe stories were essentially fake news,\u201d Xinhua wrote, adopting a phrase that Mr. Trump has embraced. The Chinese government has long denounced Western news organizations as biased and dishonest  \u2014   and in Mr. Trump, Beijing has found an American president who often does the same. The irony in China\u2019s criticism is apparent, given Beijing\u2019s history of obscuring facts and censoring stories that officials deem a threat to the party. Experts said on Friday that Mr. Trump\u2019s continuing attacks on the news media would help lend credibility to Chinese efforts to undermine Western ideals and foreign journalists. \u201cTrump\u2019s attacks on the media will offer a good excuse for Chinese officials to step up their criticism of Western democracy and press freedom,\u201d said Qiao Mu, a journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University. \u201cChina can turn to Trump\u2019s attacks to say Western democracy is hypocrisy. \u201d Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about the news media would not seem out of place in some of China\u2019s leading broadsheets, where commentators regularly denounce independent reporting by foreign news outlets on delicate subjects like Taiwan or religious persecution. Rights advocates said Mr. Trump had given China an opportunity to further distort the boundaries of journalism. \u201cIf the Chinese version of journalism, which is really only propaganda, is considered mainstream, it will challenge the understanding of what real journalism should be,\u201d said Patrick Poon, a researcher for Amnesty International in Hong Kong. The heated commentary in the Chinese news media came in response to foreign coverage of a Chinese lawyer, Xie Yang, whose account of torture at the hands of interrogators was widely reported in January, including in The New York Times. The reports about Mr. Xie, who is still in custody, were based on transcripts of his interviews with his lawyers. Xinhua\u2019s report suggested that the account of the torture of Mr. Xie, who was formally arrested last year on a charge of inciting subversion of state power, was fabricated. \u201cInvestigations by reporters and an investigative team have showed that the accusations were nothing but cleverly orchestrated lies,\u201d the report said. Xinhua said Jiang Tianyong, a prominent human rights lawyer, had invented the story and shared it with foreign activists. One of Mr. Xie\u2019s lawyers, Chen Jiangang, denied that on Friday. In a statement, Mr. Chen reiterated that Mr. Xie had provided the account of his torture, describing in detail the meeting at which he had done so. Chinese officials routinely block efforts to report on topics that the government deems delicate. On Friday, the BBC reported that its journalists had been harassed by the authorities in a village in Hunan Province while trying to interview a woman who says her family\u2019s land was stolen. The BBC said that its journalists were assaulted during the encounter, and that a crowd in the village had smashed the crew\u2019s cameras.'"}, "time": 1742563525.8919628}
