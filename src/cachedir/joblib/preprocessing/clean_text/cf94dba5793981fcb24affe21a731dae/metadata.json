[The German chancellor issued a warning over placing limits on migration into the United Kingdom, even though the issue was one of the primary motivating factors for those who voted for Britain to leave the European Union in June 2016.  According to Reuters, Mrs. Merkel implied Britain would have to pay a price if it put limits on the free movement of European Union citizens during a speech to trade unionists on Wednesday. \u201cIf the British government ends the free movement of people, that will have its price,\u201d she said at a G20 trade union event in Berlin. \u201cThat\u2019s not malice,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I cannot have all the good sides and then say there will be an upper limit of 100, 000 or 200, 000 EU citizens, no more, or just researchers, but please nobody else. This will not work. \u201d In such a scenario, the remaining 27 EU members would then have to think about what additional obstacles to throw up in order to compensate, Merkel said. \u201cWe will, of course, always think in the future relationship of the 48 or 49 percent who didn\u2019t back Brexit,\u201d the German chancellor added, also commenting that the process of Britain leaving the EU will be \u201cvery, very complicated\u201d. In recent weeks, EU officials have suggested Britain pay a 100 billion Euro bill to leave the European Union, a notion that today attracted ire from former UKIP leader Nigel Farage MEP in the Strasbourg European Parliament. \u201cEither we get some grown up, reasonable demands from the European Union or the United Kingdom will be forced to walk away before the end of this year,\u201d blasted Farage, adding: \u201cWe can\u2019t spend two years with this farce\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742562264.994182}
