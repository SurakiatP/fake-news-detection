[SiriusXM host Alex Marlow suggested there were too many conflicting statements coming from various Trump administration officials about Syria, but Gorka insisted \u201cwe have absolute clarity. \u201d  \u201cYou just have to listen to the president, the  \u201d he advised. \u201cHe has been explicit, and nothing has changed from November the 8th to today. \u201d \u201cWe sent a very clear message concerning the use of weapons of mass destruction against women and children, but the president has said we have no interest in invading other people\u2019s countries and occupying them. This isn\u2019t the Bush administration of 2003, nor is it the first Gulf War of 1991. These things are very, very clear,\u201d Gorka asserted. Marlow countered by playing a clip of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seeming to endorse regime change in Syria. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,\u201d Tillerson declared. Gorka said it was \u201cnot a binary proposition\u201d to call for regime change without also committing the United States to a military intervention. \u201cNothing that Secretary Tillerson said has anything to do with an invasion or forced removal of Assad. Nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s on the same sheet of music, whether it\u2019s the Secretary of State, whether it\u2019s Secretary Mattis, whether it\u2019s General McMaster the National Security Adviser. They all follow the lead of the   . \u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s more than one way  \u2014   there are dozens of different ways that one individual can step down from power. He doesn\u2019t have to be removed,\u201d Gorka argued. \u201cThat\u2019s why the action we took last Thursday was so seminal. We sent a message to the sponsors of this regime. \u201d \u201cRemember this is a satrapy, it\u2019s a client state of other nations,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe message we sent is, there is a point at which an individual like Assad, when he does things as heinous as using chemical weapons against unarmed women and children, the   analysis for his sponsors  \u2014   Moscow included  \u2014   has to be reassessed. \u201d  \u201cWhen that is reassessed, if he loses the sponsorship of places like the Kremlin, it becomes much easier for him to be forced out of office politically, not by force, because he simply loses the confidence of his supporters and also the people around him. Remember, Alex, Assad is just one man. He doesn\u2019t have to be removed through force. He can be removed politically. We went a great distance towards that political resolution by the actions we took last week,\u201d said Gorka. Marlow noted that much of President Trump\u2019s voting base was \u201cnot expecting him to proactively get involved in foreign entanglements that did not directly impact the national security of America. \u201d \u201cNumber One, this did impact our national security directly,\u201d Gorka responded. \u201cWhether you live in San Bernardino, Boston, or whether you live anywhere else in the United States, the idea that you have the free use of chemical weapons in a war zone  \u2014   where ISIS, our primary threat, is recruiting, is functioning, can access those weapons  \u2014   that is a primary threat to the United States. \u201d \u201cSecondly, this isn\u2019t a \u2018foreign entanglement\u2019 in the way that our Founding Fathers described it,\u201d he continued. \u201cI say to your listeners, and this is a very important question  \u2014   I understand the concerns, but really the people who voted for the president should not be concerned. \u201d  \u201cJust compare the difference between two things: the invasion of 150, 160 thousand soldiers and Marines into a given theater, whether it\u2019s Gulf I, whether it\u2019s 2003  \u2014   compare that please to the launching of 59 vehicles from the Med, from a ship in absolute safety, targeting one airfield used to launch those weapons,\u201d he urged. \u201cThese two things are incomparable, and let\u2019s have a little bit of sophistication in our analysis. One does not lead to the other. \u201d Marlow mentioned fears that even if American military actions remain as limited and   as Gorka described, there was still a danger we could be pressed into service as \u201cthe world\u2019s policeman,\u201d with an enormous number of atrocities around the world demanding our attention. \u201cThere is no intent, no desire, no endgame that involves us being a global police officer. Absolutely not,\u201d Gorka replied. \u201cWith regard to the awful things that happen in mass numbers every day around the world, we have a different perspective,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not the last eight years, when the Obama administration looked at the world as it would like it to be, as opposed to how it is. This president is a pragmatist. You don\u2019t get to be the most successful real estate mogul in New York, the toughest market in America, for 40 years unless you are a pragmatist. \u201d \u201cWe are interested in the overlap between moral imperative and national security. Strategy is exactly like politics: it is the art of the possible. We take action not because there is a global interest we take action because there is a national security interest, which sometimes may overlap with the global interest with regard to human rights or the use of chemical weapons,\u201d Gorka said.  \u201cThe primary driving metric for everything the president does, because this is his primary mission, is the safety of the American people. In this case, this has nothing to do with being a globocop. This has to do with ISIS in theater, weapons of mass destruction, and the stability of the Middle East,\u201d he stressed. Marlow said the Trump voting base was also wary of increased tensions with Russia, and was hoping the Russians could prove useful in defeating the Islamic State once and for all. He asked if the increasingly adversarial relationship between Presidents Trump and Putin was a response to \u201cCNN conspiracy theories\u201d about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Gorka responded by emphasizing Trump\u2019s instincts as a pragmatist.  \u201cThe statements coming out of Moscow should not be taken at face value. Remember who Putin was. Remember what this regime has done in the last 12 years,\u201d he added. Gorka quoted Trump\u2019s response to a question at a press conference about relations with Russia: \u201cI would like, if possible, to have good relations with Moscow. Right now, it doesn\u2019t really seem like that\u2019s possible. If that\u2019s the case, so be it. \u201d \u201cWe do not make the national security interests of the United States hostage to other people\u2019s opinions and propaganda,\u201d he declared. \u201cAs a result, the president will keep his course. \u201d Marlow brought up White House spokesman Sean Spicer\u2019s   gaffe comparing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to Adolf Hitler, and said he hoped no one in the White House seriously thought Assad was in a league with Hitler. \u201cOf course not,\u201d Gorka replied. \u201cLet\u2019s close down the conspiracy theories. \u201d Marlow said it would not be easy to make the Left take that advice, because they are in \u201ctotal meltdown over this, hysteria mode, even accusing him of Holocaust denial. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m used to it. This is what we\u2019ve been living with for 12 weeks now: the absolutely   absurd fixation on   short little clips of interviews taken out of context to spin up fake news,\u201d Gorka sighed. \u201cEverybody knows that Sean misspoke, and he stated so,\u201d he continued. \u201cI want to say one thing to my colleague Sean, and everybody I think knows this: outside of the Oval Office, Sean Spicer is a great patriot, a great American, probably has the toughest job in America. If you offered me that job, I wouldn\u2019t take it with a gun to my head. We have to recognize his professionalism. Sometimes you stumble, and he did yesterday, but he\u2019s made up for it. Let\u2019s move on. \u201d Turning to North Korea, Gorka reiterated his   determination not to \u201cgive away the playbook\u201d on strategy, but allowed that there was a \u201csimilar dynamic\u201d with North Korea and Syria. \u201cNorth Korea doesn\u2019t function without sponsorship, and we know who sponsors it,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cWe are reasserting American leadership in the world. We\u2019re filling the vacuum created by the last administration everywhere, including in Asia. \u201d  \u201cI\u2019ll simply put it this way: our actions are a forceful expression of our intent to provide leadership in the world and stability. We have    actors. North Korea is one of them. Our actions send a very clear message to those people that sponsor rogue regimes like North Korea, that they too  \u2014   like Russia with regard to Syria  \u2014   have to reassess their   analysis, and the calculation of how long they should support regimes like North Korea. Because North Korea is a destabilizing factor for all the nations of the region, and is a threat. That\u2019s the message we\u2019re sending,\u201d said Gorka.
