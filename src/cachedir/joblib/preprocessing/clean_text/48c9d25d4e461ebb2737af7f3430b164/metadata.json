And it was wielded in startling fashion last week when a Republican state senator defied a demand to stop speaking and was physically removed from the Senate floor by law enforcement. The senator, Janet Nguyen, had stood up to criticize Tom Hayden, the 1960s radical, over his opposition to the Vietnam War. Days earlier, Mr. Hayden had been honored in the Capitol for his service in the Legislature. He died in October. But as Ms. Nguyen, who fled Communist Vietnam as a child, was speaking, the presiding senator declared her out of order. When she refused to sit, he summoned the   . \u201cHave her removed immediately,\u201d said the senator, Ricardo Lara, a Democrat. If the plan was to silence Ms. Nguyen, it backfired. Captured on video, the commotion drew wide news coverage. Republicans circulated their outrage on social media, with some adopting the #shepersisted hashtag that became a rallying cry after Senator Elizabeth Warren was herself cut off during a speech. At the California Republican Party\u2019s convention over the weekend, Ms. Nguyen was held up as a symbol of free speech. Hundreds of stickers were printed that read: \u201cI stand with Janet. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unknowable for us why they wouldn\u2019t allow it,\u201d Jean Fuller, the Senate Republican leader, said of the action against Ms. Nguyen. Some Democrats accused Ms. Nguyen of having violated parliamentary rules. Mr. Lara declined through a spokesman to offer specifics. On Monday, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Senate president pro tempore, addressed the controversy on the Senate floor, saying he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by what happened. \u201cThursday was not one of the finest moments in the Senate\u2019s history,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the leader of this body, I take full responsibility for what transpired and for making sure it never happens again. \u201d That may not be enough for Republicans who are calling for an investigation. \u201cMy constituents are extremely upset,\u201d said Ms. Nguyen, who represents a part of Orange County with a large Vietnamese population. \u201cThey\u2019re upset that their voices were shut down. \u201d Even so, as happened with Ms. Warren, Ms. Nguyen\u2019s   speech got far more attention than it otherwise would have.

[San Diego  ] It was \u201cthe worst party ever. \u201d That\u2019s how Bill Schutt, author of the gripping new book \u201cCannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History,\u201d titled his chapter on the Donner Party tragedy. In the summer of 1846, a group of 87 pioneers set out from Missouri to settle the California coast. Led by George Donner, a businessman with no trail experience, the group took a misguided shortcut that in fact put them weeks behind schedule. Still, by late October, they stood before the final mountain pass in the Sierra Nevada, just a day or two from civilization on the other side. They rested for the night. And in a stroke of colossally bad luck, disaster hit. It snowed. They were stuck. Through the winter months, the group descended into starvation, madness and, infamously, cannibalism. The last survivor, found surrounded by half eaten corpses, wasn\u2019t rescued until  . All told, 35 died during the winter encampment or trying to escape it. We caught up with Mr. Schutt, who is a professor of biology at Long Island University, by phone. Some excerpts from the conversation: Q. I get the sense that your book tries to normalize cannibalism. Is that right? A. That\u2019s a fine line to walk. If you\u2019re not careful it sounds like you\u2019re condoning that behavior. And I\u2019m not. What I\u2019m doing is taking a look at it through the eyes of a zoologist, of a scientist. . .. When looking at survival cannibalism like the Donners, I\u2019m not trying to normalize that, I\u2019m trying to say that it\u2019s predictable behavior. Q. What did you learn about human nature researching this story? A. Just how strong and rugged these people were.   \u2026     They showed incredible bravery all along the way. There was individual heroism, group heroism on a scale that makes you glad that you\u2019re human. Q. Why do you think the Donner Party attracts such fascination? A. They came so close to getting across that pass. They missed it by a night. And if you\u2019ve ever stood in the Donner Pass and looked down and realized that they got this far  \u2014   that blew me away. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.
