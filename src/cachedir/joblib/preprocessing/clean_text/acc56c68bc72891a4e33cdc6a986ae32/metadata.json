The children were among 50 people who had turned out at Ridgefield Park High School for the first night of Batstock, an annual series of events in Bergen County created by Mr. D\u2019Angeli in 2009 to celebrate bats, which he said were underappreciated and misunderstood. The creatures are also being wiped out throughout the Eastern United States by a fungal disease, which Mr. D\u2019Angeli said now made education even more important. Mr. D\u2019Angeli, the director of the Wildlife Conservation and Education Center in Ridgefield Park, has spent more than two decades promoting bat conservation. He spent Sunday night dispelling myths about bats and highlighting their positive traits. No, they don\u2019t want to suck your blood, and less than 1 percent of bats actually carry rabies. Some, however, do eat hundreds or even thousands of insects every night. \u201cBats are our best natural defense against mosquitoes,\u201d he told the audience. It is one reason the decline in bat populations is so grave, Mr. D\u2019Angeli and other experts say. Since 2006,   syndrome, a fungal disease, has decimated the hibernating bat population in the Northeast. Brooke Maslo, a professor in the department of ecology, evolution, and natural resources at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N. J. studies North American bats. She said in an interview that the disease had killed millions of bats in the United States. \u201cWhen it first came through, the bats were just dead on the floor of the caves,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now there\u2019s just the skeletons. \u201cIt\u2019s like walking though a graveyard,\u201d she said. Dr. Maslo said that loss of bats could result in a huge growth of insect populations, especially of crop pests. Mr. D\u2019Angel said the population decline had added urgency to his mission to educate. \u201cI do admit, some of them look mouselike,\u201d he said as he looked at a bat\u2019s head on a screen with the audience. \u201cBut they are not rodents at all. \u201d Nearby, three   fruit bats hung in a cage. Audience members fed them pieces of papaya and honeydew on wooden skewers at the end of the program. Mr. D\u2019Angeli usually hangs out with some 20 bats in his education center, a storefront in Ridgefield Park. He is one of only two people licensed to have bats in New Jersey, according to the State Department of Environmental Protection. The center also houses spiders, snakes and other animals, most of which came from shelters or private owners who could no longer care for them. Bats were not always Mr. D\u2019Angeli\u2019s primary focus in life. In the late 1980s and early \u201990s, he was the lead singer of Roxx, a glam metal band known for a stage show that included laser lights and pyrotechnics. \u201cGo big or don\u2019t go at all, that\u2019s how Joe likes to do his shows,\u201d said John Banaski, a friend of Mr. D\u2019Angeli\u2019s since the music years and a Batstock volunteer. Mr. Banaski, 48, said the two met more than 20 years ago at one of Mr. D\u2019Angeli\u2019s concerts. Roxx disbanded in the   Mr. D\u2019Angeli said, around the same time he began devoting himself to educating the public about bats. He lectures and exhibits bats throughout New Jersey, he said, at schools, libraries and other venues. Many at Batstock took to the furry winged creatures. \u201cI like the different designs on them,\u201d Vilaiwan Galarza, 9 said. Vilaiwan, who was with her mother and younger brother, said she was not afraid. \u201cI\u2019ve seen more disgusting creatures,\u201d she said. Her mother, Kamolchanok Galarza, said she was \u201cO. K. \u201d with bats. \u201cI think it\u2019s good if they help kill mosquitoes,\u201d Ms. Galarza, 37, said. Tehilla Blau, 12, said she thought bats were interesting. \u201cSome of them can\u2019t really be described as cute, but they\u2019re also not repulsive,\u201d said Tehilla, who was with her brother and grandparents. Batstock will continue with a bat walk at the Teaneck Creek Conservancy on Sept. 18. \u201cIt\u2019s not Woodstock by any means, but it\u2019s still nice,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Angeli said. \u201cThere\u2019s one goal and one goal only,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that is to make sure that bats get the attention they deserve. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628423.0208607}
