The percentage of people who use drugs are about the same with blacks and whites. And yet the blacks are arrested way disproportionately. They\u2019re prosecuted and imprisoned way disproportionately, they get the death penalty way disproportionately. How many times have you seen a white rich person get the electric chair or get, you know, execution? If we truly want to be concerned about racism, you ought to look at a few of those issues and look at the drug laws, which are being so unfairly enforced.\u201d \\nHowever, shaming your neighbor who has nothing to do with these things, simply because their skin color is white, will solve nothing. It will only serve to fuel the flames of the bigot class by stoking the divide even further. \\nInstead of teaching students to strive for greatness, no matter what, this \u201cproject\u201d teaches them to be victims. Instead of focusing on the issue of the state\u2019s role in perpetuating the racist ideology of a few people in positions of power, PCC is attempting to lay blame to an entire group of people \u2014 because of the varying levels of melatonin in their skin. \\nRacism is an immense part of the problem, but it is important that we point out that it is only part of the problem. The other part of this problem is the color blue, and the violent unaccountable leviathan that it represents in America today. \\nA racist idiot without a badge and uniform is simply a racist idiot, add the power of the state and that racist idiot lays waste to civil rights, initiates violence, and extorts the populace; and it\u2019s called \u2018justice.\u2019 \\nWhile the intentions of those behind \u201cWhiteness History Month\u201d are likely noble, they would do well to remember the famous words spoken by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \\n\u201cI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\u201d \\nUntil we stop dwelling on the superficial qualities of our fellow humans, racism isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2014 regardless of misdirected campaigns of shame. \\nh/t Campus Reform \\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.
