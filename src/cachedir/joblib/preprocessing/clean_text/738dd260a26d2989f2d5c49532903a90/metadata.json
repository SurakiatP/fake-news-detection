Jim Jordan ( ) talked with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Thursday about healthcare reform and Obamacare repeal moving forward. [When asked about the White House working with Democrats on healthcare reform, Jordan said, \u201cI think that would be a big mistake\u201d  Added Jordan, \u201cI think that would be the wrong approach. The elections in 2010, 2014, and on November 8, 2016, weren\u2019t about working with Democrats to keep in place Obamacare. They were about repealing Obamacare. \u201d Jordan insisted this was simply a postponement in the passing of a piece of legislation and argued that Republicans should regroup and work together to pass an acceptable bill. Having pointed out that only seventeen percent of the country backed the recently failed legislation, Jordan said he believes if they had followed standard procedure, including hearings, they could have come up with a bill supported by far more than seventeen percent of America. \u201cWe were willing to accept so much that we weren\u2019t really doing cartwheels over in the legislation,\u201d said Freedom Caucus member Jordan. \u201cIf we could simply point to the fact premiums are going to come down and without getting into the weeds, there are a few key regulations that have to get repealed in Obamacare in order for premiums to come down. \u201d \u201cOne is this mandated coverages that every policy has to offer, \u201d he added. \u201cIf every policy has to cover everything, it just drives up the cost. You don\u2019t really have families being able to select the kind of insurance plan that fits their needs. So that\u2019s one regulation that has to go. \u201d Jordan had previously pointed out that rates were going to continue to rise for years under the recently failed GOP plan. He also cited \u201ccommunity rating\u201d as a problem because it prevents flexibility in pricing and the need for a \u201csafety net\u201d provision for     individuals. \u201cThat\u2019s the way you design a system that actually is   brings down costs for most middle class families. In the end, that\u2019s all we were trying to get to. And we couldn\u2019t even get those regulations included in the repeal part of the legislation,\u201d Jordan said. He insisted that with some simple tweaking, Republicans can still come together to pass healthcare reform more popular with America than the recent plan.
