[\u201cI am in Malawi to check on the children\u2019s hospital in Blantyre and my other work with Raising Malawi, and then heading home,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rumors of an adoption process are untrue. \u201d  Original story below: Blantyre (Malawi) (AFP)  \u2014   US pop superstar Madonna appeared in person at a court in the Malawian capital Lilongwe on Wednesday to apply to adopt two more local children, a court spokesman told AFP. Madonna, who runs a charity called Raising Malawi in the southern African nation, adopted Malawian children David Banda in 2006 and Mercy James in 2009. Local media reports said the singer appeared before Justice Fiona Mwale amid tight security, accompanied by two unidentified children and several other people, before being driven away in an SUV vehicle. \u201cThe court is looking at the application now to determine whether Madonna can adopt these two children,\u201d said Mlenga Mvula, spokesman of the Lilongwe High Court. \u201cThe  \u2026     process requires the court to make a ruling on the adoption. \u201d She also inspected her charity\u2019s work, including progress at a surgical unit for children at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in the commercial capital Blantyre. It was Madonna\u2019s first visit in nearly two years to Malawi, where she has at times been embroiled in controversy after her earlier adoptions.  \u2014   Adoption controversy  \u2014   She was stripped of VIP status by former president Joyce Banda\u2019s government in 2013 and accused of being \u201cuncouth\u201d and wanting eternal gratitude from the impoverished country for adopting the two children. But Banda was ousted in 2014 elections and the new president, Peter Mutharika, moved to repair relations, saying \u201cmy government has always been grateful for the passion Madonna has for this country\u201d. Last July, Madonna said she would not revive plans for a $15 million academy for girls in Malawi, which was cancelled amid allegations of mismanagement  \u2014   leading to her tiff with Banda. The singer, who divorced film director Guy Ritchie in 2008, reportedly landed in Malawi by private jet and was staying at a exclusive lodge outside Lilongwe. Madonna, who has four children, is reportedly among the biggest individual donors to children\u2019s projects such as orphanages in Malawi, which is ranked by the UN Human Development Index as one of the world\u2019s 20 least developed countries. On Saturday, she made an unannounced appearance in Washington at a rally protesting against US President Donald Trump a day after his inauguration. Madonna had campaigned for Hillary Clinton to become America\u2019s first woman president, and told Billboard Magazine after the Democrat\u2019s loss that women had a \u201ctribal inability\u201d to accept a female president.'"}, "time": 1742561868.8017757}
