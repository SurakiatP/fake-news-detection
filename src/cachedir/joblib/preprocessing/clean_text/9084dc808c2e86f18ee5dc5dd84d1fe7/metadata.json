On Monday, Columbia released a statement saying that the university\u2019s athletic department \u201chas decided that Columbia wrestlers will not compete until we have a full understanding of the facts on which to base the official response to this disturbing matter. \u201d A university official confirmed late Monday that the team was still practicing, which raised the possibility that the season would continue once the investigation was completed. Columbia withdrew from a meet on Sunday at Binghamton after the university announced it would have \u201czero tolerance in its athletics programs for the group messaging and texts sent by several members of the men\u2019s varsity wrestling team,\u201d messages that the university described as \u201cappalling. \u201d The team\u2019s next meet is scheduled for this Sunday at the New York State championships at Cornell, but Monday\u2019s announcement made it unclear if the team would make the trip. Screengrabs of the texts were first published Thursday by Bwog, an independent,   Columbia news website. The lewd texts were sent over the last three years by wrestling team members through the messaging app GroupMe, Bwog reported. The revelations at Columbia came one week after the Harvard men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s season was canceled after The Harvard Crimson, the university\u2019s student newspaper, reported that players on that team had a history of creating sexually explicit \u201cscouting reports\u201d about members of Harvard\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team. At Columbia, which in recent years has been at the center of a nationwide discussion on how colleges handle sexually aggressive behavior, some students wanted the university to take a similar stance if the accusations against the wrestling team were substantiated. \u201cSeeing that dialogue happening behind closed doors with our classmates and our peers was very, very shocking,\u201d Claire Fry, a Columbia sophomore, said Sunday, adding that she hoped canceling Sunday\u2019s   meet was \u201ca first step and not the end of the discussion. \u201d On Friday and Saturday, students protested outside the fraternity house of Kappa Delta Rho, which counts wrestlers among its membership. A Change. org petition calling for the expulsion of wrestlers had 875 supporters Monday evening. Other students were planning to spread fliers throughout campus Monday to \u201cprotest the culture that permeates Columbia\u2019s men\u2019s athletics teams,\u201d according to the description of a Facebook group. Almost 500 students were listed as interested in or planning to attend the event. Rachel Deal, a junior and Bwog\u2019s editor in chief, said that some athletes in Kappa Delta Rho who were not wrestlers were \u201creally upset with the comments\u201d and \u201cpersonally hurt\u201d by the language used. \u201cThat made me pretty hopeful that it isn\u2019t as much of a culture on other teams,\u201d Deal said. James Fast, a sophomore who is Bwog\u2019s publisher, said he was encouraged by the university\u2019s quick response and its investigation, including its decision Thursday to cancel the wrestling team\u2019s participation in its first match. Deal and Fast said they received the text messages from an anonymous source early last week. They said that Bwog had additional screengrabs that were not published because they contained targeted insults against specific students. \u201cThey were sent to us by an anonymous tipster who felt this conversation had no longer become entertainment,\u201d Fast said. The university\u2019s statement last week called the language used in the texts \u201cappalling\u201d and said they were \u201cat odds with the core values of the university, violate team guidelines and have no place in our community. \u201d Columbia\u2019s wrestling coach, Zach Tanelli, and Peter Pilling, the university\u2019s athletic director, have not been made available for interviews. Columbia and Harvard are not the only universities dealing with the exchange of controversial messages in what members thought were private group chats. Last week, black students at the University of Pennsylvania were unknowingly added to a GroupMe chat where racial slurs and lynching images proliferated. It led to an F. B. I. investigation, and a student at the University of Oklahoma was suspended for being involved in the chat.'"}, "time": 1742561881.457105}
