Asked what the purpose of his visit was, McFaul said it was to help presidential candidate Hillary Clinton prepare for what he assumed would be her transition to the White House.\\nNow McFaul, currently a Stanford University professor, is banned from Russia and Kremlin sources say he is the first of many Clinton allies to be banned.\\nMr McFaul said: \u201cI have hundreds of friends in Russia. I\u2019m really sorry that these sanctions will make communicating with people harder. \u201cI was told that I am on the Kremlin\u2019s sanctions list because of my close affiliation with Obama.\u201d\\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry did not publicly confirm the ban, but ministry sources told Russian news agencies McFaul had been added to the sanctions list.\\nHe was not banned because of his support for President Obama, a Foreign Ministry source told the TASS and RIA news agencies, but because of his \u201cactive participation in the destruction of the bilateral relationship and relentless lobbying in favour of the Clinton campaign to destabilize Russia.\u201d\\nPresident Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Donald Trump following his election victory, telling the tycoon that he had followed the election closely.\\nRussia is hoping for a \u201cnew understanding\u201d and \u201crestored Russian-American relations\u201d according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be \u201cencouraged\u201d by the American people voting to back themselves and reject the prospect of a New World Order totalitarian world government.\\nAccording to sources, Putin believes that the result of the U.S. election proves the globalists\u2019 destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand.\u201cThe American people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough. They want change.\u201d\\n'"}, "time": 1742561884.8073976}
