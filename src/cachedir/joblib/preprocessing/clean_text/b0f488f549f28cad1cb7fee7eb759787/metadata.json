[The \u201cDying to Be a Martyr\u201d multimedia lesson plan is available free of cost to teachers and students at PBS Learning Media, reports Justin Haskins at the Heartland Institute. It utilizes videos titled \u201cMartyrdom,\u201d \u201cSuicide Bombing,\u201d and \u201cIsrael and Palestine,\u201d as well as internet sites and primary sources \u201cto examine the roots of the Middle East conflict. \u201d  Students are asked to be able to understand \u201cwhy individuals and groups sometimes turn to tactics of terrorism. \u201d At first, students are asked to learn about the connections that all three major faiths  \u2014   Judaism, Christianity, and Islam  \u2014   have to Israel. However, later on in the lesson, students view the video \u201cIsrael and Palestine,\u201d and are asked to focus on 25   Majdi Amer, who built a bomb in 2003 for a suicide bomber in Haifa who ultimately killed 17 people, and wounded 50 more, on a bus. Students are asked to compare Majdi\u2019s view of suicide bombing with that of    Mohanned Abu Tayyoun, who wavers in carrying out his suicide mission and ultimately goes to jail in Israel. In Part III of the lesson plan, students view an interview with Mohanned in jail and are asked to \u201cidentify how Mohanned views his life and how he feels it differs from the lives of Israelis (Jews). \u201d \u201cMartyrdom leads us to God,\u201d he responds. \u201cI don\u2019t want this life. When you become a martyr, your prize for carrying out the operation is going to heaven  \u2026    We Palestinians prefer to die, just kill ourselves, rather than live this worthless life. Our lives are worthless. We are hollow bodies living a pointless life. \u201d \u201cIsraelis enjoy their life,\u201d Mohanned continues. \u201cThey go out at night. They have cafes and nightclubs. They travel all over the world. They go to America and Britain. We can\u2019t even leave Palestine. \u201d Teachers are asked to check students\u2019 understanding of the reasons Mohanned feels he would rather die and be a martyr than live his life. The lesson suggests that Mohanned may feel that way because \u201cPalestinians have less land, fewer privileges, cannot come and go as they please. \u201d In Part IV of the lesson plan, Majdi is interviewed in a video and is asked why it is acceptable for him to kill women and children. \u201cIf the Israelis kill a child in Gaza, I\u2019m ready to kill one in Tel Aviv,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they destroy houses in Gaza, I\u2019ll do it in Tel Aviv. If they give me security in my land, then there\u2019s no problem. \u201d \u201cNo instructions are provided telling teachers to denounce the radical claims made by Majdi, and there are no other lesson plans describing the conflict from the point of view of the Israelis,\u201d observes Haskins. JP Morgan Chase and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  \u2014   which is funded by the federal government  \u2014   fund the lesson plan\u2019s website. The Christian Action Network (CAN) has filed a demand letter with the U. S. Education Department urging it to stop funding the Islamic lesson plans that are part of a program called \u201cAccess Islam. \u201d \u201cSo, PBS Learning Media is one of the websites that is promoting it,\u201d CAN\u2019s president Martin Mawyer recently told Breitbart News. \u201cThe Smithsonian also promotes it, the Indiana Department of Education promotes it, and even the United Nations promotes it. \u201d Mawyer claims that through the Access Islam curriculum, American students are taught the Islamic way of life in a way that crosses the line from academics to indoctrination.'"}, "time": 1742562159.4340467}
