On November 18, 2015, the New York State Supreme Court, Nassau County, denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding.\\nOn October 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department, overturned the lower court\u2019s decision. In its ruling, the Appellate Court stated that the BZA does not have the authority to impose the durational limit on the restaurant\u2019s parking lot because the Town Code does not confer any such power to limit the life of the approval.\\nZoning boards routinely impose durational limits on various types of approvals given for commercial uses. Businesses often object to these time restrictions as being unfair and unnecessary burdens on their property rights because, by limiting the life of a zoning approval, zoning boards force businesses to regularly seek renewed permission for their ongoing operations.\\n\u201cWe are pleased with the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d Mr. Browne said. \u201cWe believe it strikes the proper balance between the rights of a commercial property owner and the need for the Town to protect the interest of the surrounding neighborhood.\u201d\\nNicholas J. Cappadora, an Associate with the Firm, assisted Mr. Browne on the case.\\nFor more information on Sahn Ward Coschignano, call (516) 228-1300 or visit www.swc-law.com .\\n###\\nAbout Sahn Ward Coschignano, PLLC\\nSahn Ward Coschignano, PLLC is committed to providing its clients with the highest quality representation, counsel and advice.
