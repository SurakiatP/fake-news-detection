Mankind\u2019s quest for the answer to what drives us, and what pushes us forward in times of darkness is not exempt from analysis. In fact, it\u2019s been a consistent theme since the dawn of time. Stoicism , although not directly attributed to answering \u2018what drives us\u2019, skirts around the topic and creates a general set of principles to help us deal with negative externalities in life.\\nWhile many philosophers have pontificated on the subject of mankind\u2019s driving force, and the \u2018will to live\u2019, there\u2019s a problem inherent with such an analysis. In order to research such a basic, and instinctual topic, one needs to experience a visceral, cerebral experience that brings him or her to a basic, instinctual level, before having such an epiphany. One needs to examine our animalistic base, and then explore logically from there.\\nOne such analysis is known as Logotherapy, from the Greek word logos(wise) . Logotherapy, developed by Viktor Frankl, is an influential school of psychotherapy, that is founded on the pillars of \u2018what motivates mankind\u2019. Before we delve into Logotherapy, however, it\u2019s important that we discuss Viktor Frankl\u2014who he was, and why his unique perspective provides for an incredibly powerful source of credibility and authority.\\n\\nViktor Frankl was born in 1905, in what was at that time known as Austria-Hungary. Frankl was a neurologist, and psychiatrist. His early life was relatively unspectacular, but from an early age he displayed an interest in philosophy, as well as psychotherapy. Initially interested in Freud and Adler\u2019s work, he began to see their faults, and eventually diverged from their teachings\u2014becoming particularly interested in depression, as well as suicide.\\nDuring 1933-1937, Frankl, in completing his residency in neurology, was responsible for setting up the Selbstm\u00f6rderpavillon , translated in English to \u201cthe suicide pavilion\u201d. It\u2019s estimated that Frankl, along with his staff, treated upwards of 30,000 women who had suicidal tendencies.\\nIn September of 1942, his life was shaken. Frankl, along with his wife and family, were deported to a Nazi concentration camp, known as Theresienstadt ghetto. Whilst there, and during his stay at Auschwitz, Frankl worked as a doctor in the psychiatric care unit, focusing on mental health, helping newcomers deal with shock and grief.\\n\\nIn 1946, after three years in a concentration camp, Frankl released his book entitled Man\u2019s Search for Meaning , which details his experiences as a holocaust survivor, as well as his theory, which became known as Logotherapy. The book is divided into two parts\u2014part one is a detailed account of his experiences, whereas part two discusses Logotherapy.\\nHis time in the numerous concentration camps began to shape his philosophical, and psychiatric theory. While he had read books on the subject of \u2018psychological healing\u2019 prior to his imprisonment, he had never experienced it to the degree in which he had become accustomed to. Particularly intrigued as to why some prisoners lived longer than others, Frankl began to organize his thoughts and document how the average prisoner\u2019s life in a concentration camp was reflected in their mind. As a doctor focusing on grief and shock-stricken inmates, he was in a very unique position.\\nHundreds, and during some weeks thousands, of helpless inmates were carted in Auschwitz, the most-feared concentration camp, weekly. Between the inmates sleeping next to him, and those seeking treatment, Frankl noted that each prisoner, without exception faced three stages of psychological reactions once entering the concentration camp. These stages were; shock, apathy, and depersonalization.\\nWhile seemingly unimportant, the noted documentation of these stages was very important for Frankl. As he began to notice, while every inmate experienced these stages, some experienced them to a less cerebral degree. Some inmates seemed less depressive than others, and featured a happier disposition. These inmates\u2014with some expected variability\u2014outlived the other inmates.\\nDiscovery As he began to poke and prod, Frankl noticed something that separated these individuals from others\u2014 hope. There is never not meaning in life. Every moment no matter how painful, dehumanizing or horrendous it is, has meaning. By extension, Frankl suggests, even suffering is meaningful. The inmates that survived the longest\u2014the ones that outlived the rest, had hope. Frankl suggested that he could tell whether or not an inmate would live just by looking at their faces\u2014the face of a dejected, depressed inmate was obvious and clear as day. Without hope, they were doomed.\\n\u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u2014to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way.\u201d\\nThe next question that Frankl sought to answer was an important one, and the foundational maxim of Logotherapy\u2014why did some men have hope, and others not?\\nThe answer, was love.\\n\u201cThe truth \u2013 that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which Man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of Man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.\u201d\\nFrankl, in his book Man\u2019s Search for Meaning recounted several instances where he would be driven into brief stints of depression; after a beating, during a late-night march in bare feet, or watching his friend get treated inhumanely. He\u2019d vacillate from depression by thinking, and longing for his wife. The men whom lasted the longest, invariably had a wife, or a job that they loved. It was this motivator, the unquantifiable love, that pushed men in inhuman circumstances to existentially escape the physical realm, and put mind above body.\\nWhat we can get from this To answer this, Frankl codified three ways that he discovered is how we can find meaning in life \u2013 A job, love, and how we react to suffering. It\u2019s important to realize that while it\u2019s easy to read this and assume that Frankl is saying we should all suffer in order to find meaning\u2014he\u2019s not. He IS suggesting, however, that should we not have a job/deed, or love that allow us to find meaning in life, we can still find meaning by choosing how to react in a negative situation\u2014our mental freedom is one of the only things that can never be taken from us, theoretically speaking.\\nThe average man will never be faced with such a dire circumstance such as the atrocities that Frankl and so many others dealt with. What we can do, however, is choose how we react to life\u2019s adversities.\\nA fair assessment of Logotherapy is that it provides a simplistic solution to a complex question (life). Since life is such a complex series of events, Logotherapy offers a solution that may not be representative of life\u2019s true hardships and intricacies. In saying this, my own personal evaluation is that, this criticism in itself may have flaws, by assuming that a complex question must have a complex solution. Even the assumption that life in complex can be debated. It\u2019s a cliched saying that \u2018life is hard\u2019, or complex\u2014and even if it is, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that a complex question has a simple solution \u2013 sometimes the answer we seek is right in front of us.\\nViktor Frankl died in September 1997, and his works are still read today. Several Logotherapy institutes exist today named after him.\\nRead more: Does Life Have Inherent Meaning Without Belief In God? \\n'"}, "time": 1742564405.5734947}
