[Last week the WFAN 66 AM talk show host raised eyebrows with his claim that it might be a task too difficult for a woman to manage men.  \u201cDo you know how difficult it would be on a female to manage 25 men? Or 50 men? Do you know how impossible that would be?  \u2026     It wouldn\u2019t be tough. It would be impossible,\u201d Francesa said in response to a question from a caller. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me that you would think a woman could walk into an NFL team and coach as a head coach 15 assistants and   men?\u201d Naturally, as soon as he said it, he was slammed as a \u201csexist\u201d and \u201cmisogynist. \u201d Mike Francesa with an unfathomable display of sexism. Women shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near men\u2019s sports! (Except for cheerleaders, presumably.) pic. twitter.   \u2014   Funhouse (@SportsFunhouse) March 2, 2017,  The controversy over his remarks didn\u2019t end with the weekend, though, and as the week began Francesa doubled down on his stance that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for a woman to become a head coach in pro sports. On Monday, the radio talker added more to his position saying, \u201cYou want to thrust a woman into that kind of vacuum where she\u2019s going to have to deal with that kind of scrutiny? How is she going to stand up to that? How would you find a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to stand up to that. \u201d He continued talking about how hard it would be for a woman to control an entire team of rowdy young men. \u201cIt would be so difficult to run that room. It\u2019s difficult for men to run these rooms now,\u201d he said. Liberals were still unhappy with the comments, of course. Mike Francesa responds to the backlash over his sexist comments from last week. It didn\u2019t get much better today. https:  .   \u2014   Funhouse (@SportsFunhouse) March 6, 2017,  Ty Duffy of TheBigLead. com was critical of the comments and relayed the liberal line against Francesa\u2019s comments. While admitting that the task would be very difficult, Duffy went on to attack the commonly held idea that women just can\u2019t control all those men. \u201cCouching women not being able to do things such as controlling men as \u2018practical,\u2019 \u2018reasonable,\u2019 and \u2018common sense\u2019 wisdom is a ploy to not have to dive into the assumptions that underly [sic] them, which probably sound pretty sexist if uttered,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are very few women in leadership positions in men\u2019s professional sports. There isn\u2019t a real objective reason for that. If a team thinks Becky Hammon, Nancy Lieberman, or someone else who comes along would make a great head coach, they should hire them. That hire, as with any other, would come under scrutiny and be judged by subsequent performance,\u201d Duffy concluded. But Francesa is probably only voicing the same thought a large number of sports fans hold on the topic. How likely is it that a large group of   young men would bow to the demands of a woman is certainly the question.
