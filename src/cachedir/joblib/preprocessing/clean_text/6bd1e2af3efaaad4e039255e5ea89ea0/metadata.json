But Andy Murray\u2019s second Wimbledon victory  \u2014       (3)   (2) over Milos Raonic on Sunday  \u2014   evinced great emotion just the same as Murray sat in his chair on Centre Court sobbing into his towel with the customary pomp and circumstance of the awards ceremony getting underway all around him. Murray, now 29, is no Downton Abbey Briton, raised to handle the vagaries of the game of life with a stiff upper lip in the public eye. He is a rawboned, sometimes rumpled Scotsman with gravel in his voice. He is from a modest background and a childhood colored by the tragic Dunblane school shootings, and he has always worn his ambitions and perfectionist streak on his short sleeves, shouting, cursing and hungering for more from himself at a tournament better accustomed to subtler local heroes (see Tim Henman). But Murray\u2019s deep and undisguised internal drive has been as important to his success as his foot speed and phenomenal   talent. Seeded No. 2 this year, he already was the most successful British men\u2019s tennis player since Fred Perry. He is now the first British man since Perry to win Wimbledon more than once. Perry, whose statue is on the grounds here at the All England Club, won three straight singles titles from 1934 to 1936. Murray won his first in 2013 but was also reduced to tears of a different provenance during the   ceremony after losing the final to Roger Federer in 2012. \u201cI\u2019ve had some great moments here and also some tough losses,\u201d Murray said Sunday, holding the trophy close. \u201cAnd obviously the wins feel extra special because of the tough losses. \u201d The tough losses have not come only at Wimbledon. Murray has had the rotten timing to come of age in one of the most   eras at the top in men\u2019s tennis history. For all his achievement, he has yet to reach No. 1, and his record in Grand Slam finals coming into Sunday was an unprecedented   with all of those finals being played against either Novak Djokovic or Federer. Djokovic, the world\u2019s dominant player, beat Murray in the first two major finals of the season, at the Australian Open and the French Open. Djokovic had won four straight Grand Slam tournaments and was a favorite to defend his title here as well until he was upset in the third round by the American Sam Querrey. For Murray, that meant a   final against Raonic, who upset Federer in a   semifinal to become the first Canadian man to reach a Grand Slam singles final. It also meant that for the first time in his career, Murray was a clear favorite to win a major title. He did not crack, making just 12 unforced errors over the three sets, limiting Raonic to just eight aces with his   returning and routinely producing decisive passing shot combinations  \u2014   particularly off the backhand wing  \u2014   as Raonic rightly tried to force the issue, knowing he had little chance of winning from the baseline. Murray also took surprisingly quick command of the two tiebreakers, normally Raonic\u2019s domain. \u201cI think it\u2019s phenomenal for him, to back up his win from three years ago,\u201d said Raonic, the No. 6 seed. \u201cHe\u2019s been in many finals since then that he wasn\u2019t able to make the most of. So for him it\u2019s a big step forward. The next move is up to him. He\u2019s got to go for it. There\u2019s many other guys who will be trying to go for it as well. I know I will. \u201d Since Wimbledon in 2013, Murray has gone through back surgery and two different coaches before reuniting with his mentor Ivan Lendl last month. Murray was married to his longtime girlfriend, Kim Sears, last year, and she gave birth to their daughter, Sophia, in February. Murray\u2019s life changes were clearly on his mind in the moments after victory. \u201cI\u2019m playing for something a bit different now,\u201d he said of Sophia in a postmatch interview with ESPN. \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll be proud of this one day. \u201d But he also clearly viewed this as a more personal achievement than his 2013 victory. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting this was only for me,\u201d he said Sunday after showing off his trophy from the Centre Court balcony to thousands of fans gathered below. \u201cI know it\u2019s something bigger than that. But the last time it was such a big thing for a British man to win Wimbledon. It had been so long. I was so relieved that I\u2019d done that. \u201d This time, he intends to truly savor the moment. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure I enjoy this one more than the others,\u201d he said. There may not be much time, however, with the Davis Cup still a possibility next week followed by the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and the United States Open in August. It is a grueling, global game, and Raonic is determined to keep climbing. Born in the former Yugoslavia in what is now Montenegro, Raonic immigrated to Canada with his family in 1994 and has long had his sights on the sort of success he achieved here. To maximize his chances at Wimbledon this year, he even hired John McEnroe, the   Wimbledon champion, to offer   coaching advice. But Murray, more experienced and very adept at absorbing power, was too much to handle in the end. He has now beaten Raonic in their last six matches, four of which have come this season. \u201cWith a server like Milos, you can\u2019t let up for one second,\u201d Lendl said. \u201cJust imagine if Milos breaks early in the third and wins the tiebreak in the fourth. We\u2019re still out there. There was just one break of serve the entire match. The focus Andy had today was fantastic. \u201d Murray now has three Grand Slam singles titles, still quite a contrast with the other members of the   Big Four. Federer has a career men\u2019s record of 17. Rafael Nadal has won 14, Djokovic 12. Murray, at 29, is unlikely to catch them, but he can certainly close the gap, and it will be intriguing to see what he can achieve going forward with Lendl back in his corner. \u201cEveryone\u2019s time comes at different stages,\u201d he said. \u201cSome come in their early 20s, some  . Hopefully mine is still to come. \u201d Murray has now won both tournaments he has played since Lendl, the former world No. 1, rejoined him. Murray also beat Raonic to win at the Queen\u2019s Club last month. The last time they teamed up, Murray won the gold medal at the 2012 Olympics, which was staged at the All England Club, along with the 2012 United States Open and that first Wimbledon title. \u201cHe\u2019s just lucky,\u201d Murray said in his postmatch remarks of Lendl as the crowd laughed along. Murray got more laughs when he came to the rescue of the departing British prime minister, David Cameron, who was sitting in the Royal Box on Sunday near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and who received a mixture of boos and cheers. \u201cI think playing a Wimbledon final is tough, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t like to be the prime minister,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible job. \u201d Getting the ball past the great wall of Murray seemed well nigh impossible, too, on Sunday, but for all the good cheer in victory, this was hardly a lighthearted afternoon in general on Centre Court. Murray had made that clear only a few moments before as he sat in his chair with his face buried in his towel and then buried in his hands. Three years is a long time to wait for a player with his kind of talent, his kind of desire.'"}, "time": 1742563484.6207902}
