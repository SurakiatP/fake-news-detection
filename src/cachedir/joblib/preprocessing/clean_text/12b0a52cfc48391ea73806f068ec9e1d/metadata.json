There\\'s been no systematic investigation of various issues. \\nI know this generation of Republican leaders is loath to exercise these tools, but impeachment is something that\\'s relevant. \\nThey see [the oversight process] as an opportunity in some measure to keep their opponents off-kilter, but they don\\'t want to do the substantive and principled work to truly hold corrupt politicians, or the administration, or anyone accountable.\" \\nSince the FBI recommended no indictment for Hillary Clinton, the call to reopen the case into her email server has been shut down by the Bureau. \\nOn the other hand, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump isn\\'t satisfied with the outcome. He even wants to go as far to investigate the FBI\\'s investigation if he takes the White House. \\nMeanwhile, Judicial Watch has launched an investigation into Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe , whose political organization donated about $500,000 to the campaign coffers of Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of an FBI figurehead who helped provide oversight over the investigation into Clinton\\'s private server.
