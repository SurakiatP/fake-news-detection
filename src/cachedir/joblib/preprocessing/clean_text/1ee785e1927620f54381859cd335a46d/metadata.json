Absolutely everyone. Even the \u201chaters and losers.\u201d \\nHere\u2019s Trump\u2019s Thanksgiving Day message he tweeted out three years ago: \\n\u201cHappy Thanksgiving to all\u2013even the haters and losers!\u201d via Twitter \\nYes, that\u2019s the future leader of the free world, everyone. A man who will have more power than, well, anyone. \\nTrump took to Twitter on Thanksgiving Day in 2013 and wished everyone a \u201cHappy Thanksgiving\u201d even to the \u201chaters and losers\u201d and best yet, the tweet is still in his timeline . So, the future President of the United States seems pretty damn proud of calling those who don\u2019t like him \u201chaters and losers\u201d because he still has it on the record in his Twitter feed. \\nIt will be interesting to see what he tweets this year. Will it be off the cuff, or well-vetted by his staff. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all on pins and needles waiting. Or not. \\nFeatured Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images \u2014 Twitter '"}, "time": 1742561793.6604445}
