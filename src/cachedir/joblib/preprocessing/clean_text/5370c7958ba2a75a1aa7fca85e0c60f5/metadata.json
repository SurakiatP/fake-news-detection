Sous vide, which means \u201cunder vacuum\u201d in French, involves sealing food in an airtight bag and giving it a   bath. A cylindrical gadget gently circulates and heats the water to a precise, consistent temperature, allowing the food to reach the exact temperature the cook desires without the risk of overcooking. Its advocates say the method is the key to attaining a piece of meat that is uniformly tender and juicy inside. But gosh, it can take forever. Enthusiasts who sing the praises of sous vide often try to indoctrinate home cooks with the holy grail of recipes: the perfect   steak. Set the device to heat up the water to around 129 degrees, immerse the bagged steak in the water and, like magic, you have a steak that is perfectly   all the way through, not just in the center. Give it a sear to brown the crust, and it\u2019s close to something you would get at a steakhouse. Glossed over in that sales pitch is the part where sous vide takes at least an hour to cook the steak, or up to 10 times longer than it would using conventional methods, like a stove or grill. Herein lies the problem. Yes, cooking sous vide is more affordable than ever, with   devices ranging from $100 to $300, but the technique may feel impractical and inaccessible to the average home cook, particularly one with a demanding schedule. The plethora of   recipes published online are largely aimed at perfectionist cooks who have time on their hands. But what if sous vide actually made life easier for the home cook, even on weeknights? J. Kenji   the managing culinary director of the website Serious Eats and the author of \u201cThe Food Lab,\u201d a cookbook about the science of cooking, said that the   machine could leave the realm of specialty cooking and enter the world of convenience if people just planned ahead weekly or monthly. \u201cMost people, when they think about dinner, say, \u2018What can I get at the grocery store now and get going tonight? \u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt requires a lot more forethought. \u201d It also requires bigger thinking  \u2014   as in bigger than a single steak. To fit sous vide into his schedule, Grant Crilly, a founder of ChefSteps, a recipe website and technology company in Seattle that is devoted to the cooking method, turns to two economical cuts of meat, the pork shoulder or beef chuck roast, which cost roughly $4 to $10 a pound at a grocery store and are far less expensive than buying a comparable number of steaks. Mr. Crilly, a chef who was part of the team that produced Nathan Myhrvold\u2019s \u201cModernist Cuisine\u201d cookbook, cooks the meat sous vide for 24 hours, and then divides it into   steaks. Each steak gets sealed in a plastic sandwich bag and moved to the freezer, creating a protein stockpile that can be easily transformed into delectable meals. When Mr. Crilly is ready to cook, he transfers the meat straight from the freezer into heated water and waits about 75 minutes for it to thaw. It\u2019s kind of like gourmet astronaut food. From there, it\u2019s up to the home cook\u2019s imagination how to use the beef or pork. There\u2019s the obvious, like a juicy boneless pork chop or beef steak: Add seasoning and give it a sear on the stove. Instant ramen can be upgraded into a chashu pork ramen. For taco night, grab the tortillas, slice the meat and fry it with some salt, pepper and onion. Pork shoulder and beef chuck are very tough cuts that are typically   until they collapse into  : think pulled pork or pot roast. But cooking them sous vide does something special. The muscles in the shoulders are among the most actively used, which means the cut contains more collagen and flavor than the more tender options in the butcher case. A long   bath breaks down the collagens while keeping the texture of the meat intact. The softened collagens act like a lubricant in your mouth. The result is a beef or pork steak that tastes even juicier and more flavorful than a   or pork chop  \u2014   as tender as you can imagine, but not falling apart until it hits your tongue, Mr. Crilly said. \u201cCook it slow, unlock all that really beautiful flavor, and you\u2019ve got a really nice piece of meat,\u201d he said. And starting dinner prep with a versatile piece of meat that\u2019s already cooked through, tender and flavorful is a boon to any home cook. \u201cYou end up with this instant upgrade to any dish,\u201d Mr. Crilly said. He added that one night, when he and his wife returned exhausted from a long day of work, he reheated a frozen pork chop using sous vide, diced the meat into cubes and quickly   it with vegetables for a satisfying dinner. The caveat is that 24 hours to cook a large slab of meat is a long time. Also, thawing frozen meat in a   bath, as Mr. Crilly does, takes at least an hour. But to him, the   is worth it. One day of prep work yields a few months\u2019 worth of protein that can be quickly paired with items already in his refrigerator or pantry. The actual cooking is unattended and extraordinarily forgiving. It\u2019s all but impossible to overcook meat sous vide, because the water bath stays at the temperature that you want the food to reach. And during that hour it takes a frozen steak to thaw, Mr. Crilly bakes potatoes or throws together a salad. With some forethought, you can even save yourself a little time before dinner. In the morning, you could heat a pot of water with the   machine, throw in a frozen beef or pork steak and let it cook all day. By the time you get home, the meat is ready to be seared and devoured. Or you could do as Mr.   does. In the morning, he moves some of the raw salmon or halibut pieces he keeps in the freezer to the refrigerator to let them thaw throughout the day. When his wife gets home from work, he turns on his   device and throws the fish in the pot for 30 minutes to cook it. \u201cIt probably takes you about the same amount of effort to turn on the   device and put the food in there as it does to place a delivery order with your phone,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628498.9038656}
