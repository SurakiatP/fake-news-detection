Martha Brown, a teacher from the school, said on Monday that a different security guard had given permission for her students to sing. But the second guard said, \u201cYou just can\u2019t do this you\u2019ve got to stop now,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cSo we very reverently and quietly stopped what we were doing and complied with his request and quietly exited the park. \u201d Video posted afterward by an adult on the school field trip had prompted outrage and led to an invitation for the students to sing the anthem live on Fox News. Ms. Brown and Trevor Putnam, the school\u2019s principal, joined the students for their performance at the school on Monday. Ms. Brown said her students learned from the experience. \u201cWe turned it into a teaching moment and taught them that even if you don\u2019t agree with it, or understand it, you must respect authority,\u201d she said. Mr. Putnam echoed the sentiment. \u201cThe lesson learned here is always to respect authority,\u201d the principal said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so proud of our kids for conducting themselves the way they did. \u201d Crystal Mulvey, a parent who accompanied her daughter on the trip, said she was shocked that the guard interrupted the national anthem because \u201cit\u2019s kind of a sacred song to us. \u201d But, she added, \u201cOn the flip side, I completely understand following rules. \u201d Striking a balance between remembering those killed by terrorists and rebuilding a bustling commercial district has been a challenge since the attack in 2001. Tourists paying their respects to the dead now share the memorial plaza with neighborhood residents and office workers from the new World Trade Center towers eating lunch under the trees. Officials at the memorial said groups wishing to perform on the crowded plaza are supposed to pay $35 to apply for a permit and obey a list of rules that includes not using amplified sound and not interfering with the flow of traffic. Ms. Brown said she was not aware of the permit requirement.'"}, "time": 1742563591.491921}
