Even in the U.S. presidential debates, the arguing between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton has been almost exclusively about ISIS, not Al Qaeda.

(There also are allegations that some of the most notable images have been staged , like a fake war scene from the 1997 dark comedy, \u201cWag the Dog.\u201d) \\nRare Glimpse of Truth \\nYet, occasionally, the reality of Al Qaeda\u2019s importance in the rebellion breaks through, even in the mainstream U.S. media, although usually downplayed and deep inside the news pages, such as the A9 article in Saturday\u2019s New York Times by Hwaida Saad and Anne Barnard describing a rebel offensive in Aleppo. It acknowledges: A fake war scene in the dark 1997 comedy \u201cWag the Dog,\u201d which showed a girl and her cat fleeing a bombardment in Albania. \\n\u201cThe new offensive was a strong sign that rebel groups vetted by the United States were continuing their tactical alliances with groups linked to Al Qaeda, rather than distancing themselves as Russia has demanded and the Americans have urged. \u2026 The rebels argue that they cannot afford to shun any potential allies while they are under fire, including well-armed and motivated jihadists, without more robust aid from their international backers.\u201d (You might note how the article subtly blames the rebel dependence on Al Qaeda on the lack of \u201crobust aid\u201d from the Obama administration and other outside countries \u2013 even though such arms shipments violate international law.) \\nWhat the article also makes clear in a hazy kind of way is that Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate, the recently renamed Nusra Front, and its jihadist allies, such as Ahrar al-Sham, are waging the brunt of the fighting while the CIA-vetted \u201cmoderates\u201d are serving in mostly support roles. The Times reported: \\n\u201cThe insurgents have a diverse range of objectives and backers, but they issued statements of unity on Friday. Those taking part in the offensive include the Levant Conquest Front, a militant group formerly known as the Nusra Front that grew out of Al Qaeda; another hard-line Islamist faction, Ahrar al-Sham; and other rebel factions fighting Mr. Assad that have been vetted by the United States and its allies.\u201d \\nThe article cites Charles Lister, a senior fellow and Syria specialist at the Middle East Institute in Washington, and other analysts noting that \u201cthe vast majority of the American-vetted rebel factions in Aleppo were fighting inside the city itself and conducting significant bombardments against Syrian government troops in support of the Qaeda-affiliated fighters carrying out the brunt of front-line fighting.\u201d \\nLister noted that 11 of the 20 or so rebel groups conducting the Aleppo \u201coffensive have been vetted by the C.I.A. and have received arms from the agency, including anti-tank missiles. \u2026 \\n\u201cIn addition to arms provided by the United States, much of the rebels\u2019 weaponry comes from regional states, like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Mr. Lister said, including truck-borne multiple-rocket launcher systems and Czech-made Grad rockets with extended ranges.\u201d \\nThe U.S./Al Qaeda Alliance \\nIn other words, the U.S. government and its allies have smuggled sophisticated weapons into Syria to arm rebels who are operating in support of Al Qaeda\u2019s new military offensive against Syrian government forces in Aleppo. By any logical analysis, that makes the United States an ally of Al Qaeda. A heart-rending propaganda image designed to justify a major U.S. military operation inside Syria against the Syrian military. \\nThe Times article also includes a quote from Genevieve Casagrande, a Syria research analyst from the Institute for the Study of War, a neoconservative \u201cthink tank\u201d that has supported more aggressive U.S. military involvement in Syria and the Middle East. \\n\u201cThe unfortunate truth, however, is that these U.S.-backed groups remain somewhat dependent upon the Al Qaeda linked groups for organization and firepower in these operations,\u201d Casagrande said. \\nThe other unfortunate truth is that the U.S.-supplied rebels have served, either directly or indirectly, as conduits to funnel U.S. military equipment and ordnance to Al Qaeda. \\nOne might think that the editors of The New York Times \u2013 if they were operating with old-fashioned news judgment rather than with propagandistic blinders on \u2013 would have recast the article to highlight the tacit U.S. alliance with Al Qaeda and put that at the top of the front page. \\nStill, the admissions are significant, confirming what we have reported at Consortiumnews.com for many months, including Gareth Porter\u2019s article last February saying : \u201cInformation from a wide range of sources, including some of those the United States has been explicitly supporting, makes it clear that every armed anti-Assad organization unit in those provinces [of Idlib and Aleppo] is engaged in a military structure controlled by [Al Qaeda\u2019s] Nusra militants. All of these rebel groups fight alongside the Nusra Front and coordinate their military activities with it. \u2026 \\n\u201cAt least since 2014 the Obama administration has armed a number of Syrian rebel groups even though it knew the groups were coordinating closely with the Nusra Front, which was simultaneously getting arms from Turkey and Qatar.\u201d \\nDouble Standards \\nThe Times article on page A9 also deviated from the normal propaganda themes by allowing a statement by Syrian officials and the Russians regarding their suspension of airstrikes over the past week to permit the evacuation of civilians from east Aleppo and the rebels\u2019 refusal to let people leave, even to the point of firing on the humanitarian corridors: An Israeli strike caused a huge explosion in a residential area in Gaza during the Israeli assault on Gaza in 2008-2009. (Photo credit: Al Jazeera) \\n\u201cThe [Syrian] government and its [Russian] allies accused the rebels of forcing Aleppo residents to stay, and of using them as human shields.\u201d \\nThe \u201chuman shields\u201d argument is one that is common when the United States or its allies are pummeling some city controlled by \u201cenemy\u201d forces whether Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza or the U.S. Marines\u2019 leveling of Fallujah in Iraq or the current campaign against ISIS in the Iraqi city of Mosul. In those cases, the horrific civilian bloodshed, including the killing of children by U.S. or allied forces, is blamed on Hamas or Sunni insurgents or ISIS but never on the people dropping the bombs. \\nAn entirely opposite narrative is applied when U.S. adversaries, such as Syria or Russia, are trying to drive terrorists and insurgents out of an urban area. Then, there is usually no reference to \u201chuman shields\u201d and all the carnage is blamed on \u201cwar crimes\u201d by the U.S. adversaries. That propaganda imperative helps explain why Al Qaeda and its jihadist comrades have been largely whited out of the conflict in Aleppo. \\nOver the past few years, U.S. regional allies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, also have shifted their public attitudes toward Al Qaeda, seeing it as a blunt instrument to smash the so-called \u201cShiite crescent\u201d reaching from Iran through Syria to Lebanon. For instance, in September 2013, Israel\u2019s Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, then a close adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the Jerusalem Post that Israel favored Syria\u2019s Sunni extremists over President Assad. \\n\u201cThe greatest danger to Israel is by the strategic arc that extends from Tehran, to Damascus to Beirut. And we saw the Assad regime as the keystone in that arc,\u201d Oren told the Jerusalem Post in an interview . \u201cWe always wanted Bashar Assad to go, we always preferred the bad guys who weren\u2019t backed by Iran to the bad guys who were backed by Iran.\u201d He said this was the case even if the \u201cbad guys\u201d were with Al Qaeda. \\nAnd, in June 2014, speaking as a former ambassador at an Aspen Institute conference, Oren expanded on his position, saying Israel would even prefer a victory by the brutal Islamic State over continuation of the Iranian-backed Assad in Syria. \u201cFrom Israel\u2019s perspective, if there\u2019s got to be an evil that\u2019s got to prevail, let the Sunni evil prevail,\u201d Oren said. \\nWarming to Al Qaeda \\nAs Israeli officials shifted toward viewing Al Qaeda and even ISIS as the lesser evils and built a behind-the-scenes alliance with Saudi Arabia and the Sunni states, American neoconservatives also began softening their tone regarding the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. Michael Oren, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States. \\nAcross the U.S. foreign policy establishment, pressure built for \u201cregime change\u201d in Damascus even if that risked handing Syria to Sunni jihadists. That strategy hit a road bump in 2014 when ISIS began chopping off the heads of Western hostages in Syria and capturing swathes of territory in Iraq, including Mosul. \\nThat bloody development forced President Barack Obama to begin targeting ISIS militants in both Iraq and Syria, but the neocon-dominated Washington establishment still favored the Israeli-Saudi objective of \u201cregime change\u201d in Syria regardless of how that might help Al Qaeda. \\nThus, Al Qaeda\u2019s Nusra Front and its jihadist ally, Ahrar al-Sham, faded into the background under the fiction that the anti-Assad forces were primarily noble \u201cmoderates\u201d trying to save the children from the bloodthirsty fiends, Assad and Putin. \\nGrudgingly, The New York Times, deep inside Saturday\u2019s newspaper, acknowledged at least part of the troubling reality, that the U.S. government has, in effect, allied itself with Al Qaeda terrorists. \\n[For more background on this issue, see Consortiumnews.com\u2019s \u201c New Group Think for War with Syria/Russia. \u201d] \\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.
