[On Wednesday afternoon, Armstrong issued the following memo to the entire campus community:  Many of you have raised concerns about Milo Yiannopoulos, a guest speaker invited by the Cal Poly College Republicans club to present at Cal Poly on January 31, 2017. Several individuals who find Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019 comments offensive have contacted the university and demanded that he not be permitted to speak. To be clear, it is not the role of a public institution such as ours to endorse any position or decide who should or should not be allowed to appear on campus. Indeed, numerous guest speakers considered by many to be controversial or offensive have presented at our university throughout its history. Armstrong\u2019s statement is true. In 2012, he also quietly dismissed those who were protesting conservative commentator Ann Coulter\u2019s right to speak on campus. Challenging the \u201csafe space\u201d rhetoric of his counterparts, Armstrong continued to emphasize that \u201cPublic universities such as Cal Poly represent communities where the free exchange of opposing ideas is both encouraged and necessary. \u201d \u201cIt is, in fact, the university\u2019s responsibility to support the rights of all people to express their opinions and ideas  \u2014   regardless of how unpopular they may be  \u2014   while also encouraging students to think critically and independently,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is only in this environment that students hone the ability to consider a spectrum of information and reach informed and intelligent conclusions. \u201d \u201cThe real danger is not the expression of controversial voices  \u2014   it is censorship and the restriction of free speech,\u201d continued Armstrong. \u201cFreedom of speech is a foundational tenet of higher education and a functional democracy. It does not allow for the suppression of viewpoints based upon popularity or individual perspectives. Rather, open expression of a diversity of ideas and opinions  \u2014   including those we may not agree with  \u2014   ensures rich discussion, debate and critical thought. \u201d \u201cProtecting freedom of speech is not an option,\u201d Armstrong concluded. \u201c[I]t is a critical responsibility that the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563117.6398354}
