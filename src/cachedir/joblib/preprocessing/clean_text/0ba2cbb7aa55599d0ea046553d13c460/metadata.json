After decades as the drummer and   Gabriel lead singer for Genesis, as well as a commercially dominant solo run as the poster boy for pillowy \u201980s pop excess, Mr. Collins retired as a    rock elder in 2011. As with most musician goodbyes, the dormant period didn\u2019t last. (Presciently, Mr. Collins had called his tour in support of the 2002 album \u201cTestify,\u201d his most recent release of original material, the \u201cFirst Farewell Tour. \u201d) Since announcing his resurgence last year, Mr. Collins, 65, has performed at a handful of charity events, in addition to starting the process of reissuing eight of his solo albums. On Aug. 29, he will be the musical guest at the opening ceremony for the United States Open tennis tournament in Flushing, Queens  \u2014   the biggest stage he\u2019s graced in some time Leslie Odom Jr. the   \u201cHamilton\u201d alum, is scheduled to join Mr. Collins in a duet. The gig serves as a   of sorts for a busy fall: In October, a   collection, \u201cThe Singles\u201d (including seven American No. 1s) is due out alongside Mr. Collins\u2019s memoir, \u201cNot Dead Yet. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like a cartoon character that\u2019s being pulled along with his feet dug in,\u201d Mr. Collins said of his comeback, though he\u2019s often doing both the dragging and the digging in. Over the phone from his home in Miami, he discussed his hesitancy, fueled by both health issues and fatherhood, and how making himself scarce has improved his legacy. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. How is   treating you? Well, you know, whatever I am doing, I\u2019m doing slowly. I\u2019m just being a little tentative. It\u2019s very dangerous, as my oldest daughter, Joely, told me, to stop doing what you\u2019ve done all your life. I joined Genesis when I was 19. I was drumming from the age of 5. You\u2019re taking away something that makes you tick. When she said that a few years ago, when I first retired, that stayed with me. Then you get out there [to perform] and people like what you do, and you think, \u201cI can do more of this. \u201d What\u2019s your daily routine like now? I do very little. To be honest, even this week, I\u2019ve still been working on this memoir. Otherwise, it\u2019s just really family stuff. When I first moved [to Miami] I couldn\u2019t wait to be back with my kids. I was taking them to school, getting up at 6:30, picking them up later. The day revolved around that. But I had back surgery last year, which was necessary because my back was [expletive] after all the years playing drums. The surgery left me with a numb right foot  \u2014   they call it drop foot. You have no motor down there. The nerves regenerate over a period of a year and a half or two years. It\u2019s been nine months. I can\u2019t go out and play football with my youngest, and I can\u2019t drive. So that\u2019s kind of limiting. How often are you playing music? Very little, actually. [My son] Nick, who\u2019s 15 now, I listen to him play, I watch his band. I\u2019ve got a grand piano here, and sometimes Nick will say, \u201cHow do you play this, Dad?\u201d But without going into the war wounds, my left hand had some neural thing happen to it, which stopped me from playing the drums. That kind of has restricted [piano] as well. I\u2019ve got a little studio here, and at some point, I will turn it on and start fooling around. That day is getting closer. I think about it a lot  \u2014   I\u2019ve got a lot of lyrical ideas  \u2014   but I keep putting it off. What do you make of the critical   of your work in the last few years? I think it\u2019s fantastic. I think, with some critics, I became synonymous with an era of music that they didn\u2019t like, and they were suspicious of all success, which is understandable. You end up painted into a corner that it\u2019s impossible to get out of. I don\u2019t lie awake and think about this, but I withdrew in 2005, and I think I was quite honest about why: I wanted to write myself out of the script. When the reissued albums came out  \u2014   which I was reluctant to do at first, until I found some way I could be proud of it  \u2014   I thought, \u201cThis is exactly what I\u2019d hoped for. \u201d Of course, records sell differently now than when I was making them, so it wasn\u2019t a question of cashing in. It was giving people a chance to   this person that had become a whipping boy for the \u201980s. I was so pleased that people were able to say, \u201cI   at this, and it\u2019s better than I thought. \u201d Is there a part of you that wants to get involved with this new generation, \u00e0 la Paul McCartney with Kanye West, or Nile Rodgers with Daft Punk? It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t had the offers. It\u2019s just I\u2019m trying my best not to get busy. Doing the book was an  . I have not really realized just how incessantly I was out there. From tour to tour to tour, one record, one collaboration after the other. It was an incredibly dense 25 years. What gets you out of the house for something like the United States Open? Is it the paycheck? I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m getting paid for it. I don\u2019t, seriously. If I am, I don\u2019t know what it is. I think my manager put it to me that he\u2019d been asked, assuming I\u2019d say no, and I said, \u201cActually, why not?\u201d It\u2019s not a big ask. It\u2019s just a couple of songs at the opening of something that I would probably be watching anyway. You\u2019ve said your memoir will be embarrassingly honest. What were some of the harder things to include? With three marriages, you know, and what happened   \u2026     I stress it\u2019s not a   book. I\u2019m not blaming anybody. I was just working so much, and stuff got in the way. There\u2019s a chapter in it about the drinking, which escalated when my third marriage broke up, and I retired. I was left with this huge void. I didn\u2019t want to work because I wanted to be with the kids, but the kids weren\u2019t there anymore, because they moved to Miami, and I was still in Switzerland. You start drinking, and then you start drinking too much. Then it physically hurts you. I came very close to dying at that point. I\u2019m being honest about that. The book is honest, it\u2019s  . I\u2019m not shirking my responsibilities. I apologize when I need to.'"}, "time": 1742563338.397632}
