S. over the last decade. [In Noel, Missouri, some 500 to 600 Somali and Sudanese immigrants and refugees now live in the region of just more than 1, 800 residents, as noted by USA Today in a piece highlighting the changing face of the area.  A particular Somali migrant quoted in the USA Today piece spoke about her father now trying to apply as a refugee in U. S. in order to move to Noel. On Thursday morning, inside a   apartment a block from Main Street,    Bedel Kayd and his    brother Saadiq sat quietly while finishing a bag of cheese puffs. With Abdullahi acting as translator, their mother, Mun Omer  \u2014   a Somalian who arrived in the United States in October  \u2014   said she initially thought President Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigrants or visa holders from seven countries  \u2014   Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria and Yemen  \u2014   for 90 days and refugees for 120 days meant refugees like her would have to return to their home countries. Trump\u2019s executive order bans refugees from Syria indefinitely. Omer said she was relieved, to a degree, to learn that her initial fear wasn\u2019t true. But the reality still doesn\u2019t bode well for her father, who is trying to come to America. Immigration expert Ira Mehlman with the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) said that while extended family chain migration is a \u201cgeneral bad policy,\u201d he said the booming Somali and Sudanese populations in Noel were most likely due to Tyson Foods\u2019   plant in the town. The Tyson factory provides about 1, 600 jobs to Noel residents. The influx in refugees to the region has, however, cramped the local labor market. \u201cThese   companies undermine the union jobs,\u201d Mehlman told Breitbart Texas. \u201cThey\u2019ve brought in illegal aliens and refugees, but essentially, they\u2019ve used this to replace their unionized workforce. It\u2019s a labor subsidy for the employers. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a myth that illegal aliens are a source of cheap labor,\u201d Mehlman continued. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap only to the direct employer. The rest of us have to pay for healthcare, education, and other social services. \u201d Mehlman told Breitbart Texas that in areas similar to Noel, where corporate plants employ the majority of small town population, it is the companies that incentivize chain migration policies which already allow for spouses and unmarried children to come to the U. S. \u201cIn other places, it has been the employers that has created this phenomenon,\u201d Mehlman said. \u201cThey prefer these foreign workers over unionized employees. \u201d Immigration groups like FAIR and NumbersUSA have been pushing President Trump\u2019s administration to reform chain migration policy, citing that it only leads to more illegal immigration.
