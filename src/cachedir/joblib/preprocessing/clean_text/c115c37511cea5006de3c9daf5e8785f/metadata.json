A week after former President Bill Clinton lit a political firestorm by strolling onto Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch\u2019s plane for a private conversation, the director of the F. B. I. announced that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges over Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information. And then, just three hours later, President Obama and Mrs. Clinton emerged arm in arm from Air Force One in North Carolina for their first joint campaign rally. But this politically pregnant convergence of events was not met with a battalion of   Republican law enforcement and national security officials flooding the television airwaves to raise questions about the inquiry and hammer Mrs. Clinton. Nor was there any     video contrasting what the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cextremely careless\u201d handling of 110 classified emails with the former secretary of state\u2019s shifting explanations over the last year about her use of a private email server. There were not even any talking points sent to leading Republican members of Congress offering guidance on the best lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton in the aftermath of what was a remarkably harsh assessment of her conduct. \u201cInstead we\u2019re relying on somebody who\u2019s tweeting with exclamation points,\u201d said Mr. Walsh, referring to Donald J. Trump\u2019s initial response to Mr. Comey\u2019s news conference. Mr. Trump\u2019s improvisational response to the conclusion of an F. B. I. investigation against his opponent that had been months in the making illustrated the lingering deficiencies of his skeletal campaign and the lack of   Republicans with foreign policy experience who are willing to speak on his behalf. For many in the party it also was a painful reminder of what could have been  \u2014   how a different   could have capitalized on one of the most difficult days Mrs. Clinton has faced as a candidate. For the Republican establishment, the months since Mr. Trump began closing in on the presidential nomination have been a season of dismay and frustration: Handed a historically weak Democratic opponent to run against, the party\u2019s voters responded by nominating a candidate even more unpopular and toxic than Mrs. Clinton. But there have been few days during this cycle of disbelief in which the sense of regret has been as palpable for Republican strategists and policy makers as when Mr. Comey jolted the political world back to life after a long holiday weekend. \u201cImagine Jeb Bush looking disappointed and talking about the importance of following the rules and a society ruled by law with a government that is held accountable,\u201d said Kori Schake, a fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution and a national security aide in George W. Bush\u2019s administration who is now backing Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThis should be a really great moment for a Republican nominee. But there\u2019s no way in the world Donald Trump could pull that off. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign did, in fact, issue a longer statement regarding Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email use beyond his initial assessment of \u201cvery very unfair!\u201d and he used his own rally Tuesday night in North Carolina to assail his Democratic rival. \u201cWe are talking about the safety of our people,\u201d he told a crowd in Raleigh. \u201cThe laws are very explicit. Stupidity is not a reason that you\u2019re going to be innocent. \u201d Yet for many in his own party, there was deep angst over the possibility that they could lose to a Democratic candidate who was just deemed by one of the country\u2019s most highly respected law enforcement officials to have presided over a State Department whose lackadaisical security culture invited foreign hackers. \u201cHe\u2019s making somebody who should be sitting in a jail cell look like the sane choice for president,\u201d said John Noonan, a former Air Force officer who served as a national security aide to Mitt Romney in 2012 and in Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign this year. \u201cThis should have been a   putt. But Republicans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. \u201d What was especially exasperating to so many in the party was that the turn of events over the last week was only the latest opportunity in a month for Mr. Trump to go on the offensive. The Islamic   rampage in Orlando, Fla. and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union offered him prime political moments, but he unnecessarily inserted himself into each story and saw no improvement in his standing in the polls. \u201cTrump overtakes news cycles at every turn,\u201d complained Mr. Walsh. \u201cMy God, he was on his golf course saying what a good thing the pound\u2019s collapse would be for his bottom line. \u201d (Some Republicans feared Mr. Trump was again frittering away an opportunity when, rather than focusing entirely on the F. B. I. probe, he used his speech on Tuesday night to offer praise for Saddam Hussein.) However, in a campaign year animated by a voter revolt against Washington and the perceived   of an    political class there may be no more of a gift than what Mr. Comey delivered to an outsider candidate like Mr. Trump, whose jeremiads against what he calls a \u201crigged\u201d system have been central to his improbable rise. \u201cThis is an example of what voters are totally fed up with,\u201d said Liesl Hickey, the former executive director of the House Republican campaign arm, alluding to the F. B. I. \u2019s decision to not recommend charges. But Ms. Hickey, pointing out that Mr. Trump refuses to release his income tax returns, noted that the candidate also bore his own baggage on the very argument he is making against Mrs. Clinton. \u201cAmericans also think the system is rigged for the top 1 percent, so they think the system could be rigged for him, too,\u201d she said. Whether it is with his taxes, his pronouncements or his willingness to raise money and create a sophisticated organization, Mr. Trump has gleefully flouted convention. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think traditional campaigns matter as much anymore, that he can do this on social media,\u201d said Jim Merrill, a New   Republican strategist. \u201cBut the truth is, running a campaign still matters a great deal. And if we had nominated anyone else we\u2019d be up on Hillary. But we\u2019re down because we\u2019ve got an incompetent candidate who has alienated large swaths of the electorate. \u201d For his part, Mr. Walsh was just flabbergasted that his party had a nominee whose war room often seems to begin and end with the candidate\u2019s Twitter feed. \u201cWhy would he rush out a tweet as his primary response?\u201d wondered Mr. Walsh. \u201cHe\u2019s just demonstrating he is unable or unwilling to appear presidential at moments like this, when it\u2019s required. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564613.050287}
