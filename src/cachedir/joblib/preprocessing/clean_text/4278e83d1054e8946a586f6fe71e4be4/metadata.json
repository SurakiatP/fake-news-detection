As Jos\u00e9 and Zoraida Mu\u00f1iz and their children have struggled to deal with a   series of trials and setbacks, including cancer, debilitating epilepsy, deep depression and near eviction, it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together. Zoraida\u2019s early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel. She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children\u2019s father withdrew support. Then Zoraida\u2019s grandfather  \u2014   the father of her absent father  \u2014   destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met Jos\u00e9, a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle, a judge, they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction, using skills she learned as a child, and in a clothing store. But in 1987, Mr. Mu\u00f1iz began having violent seizures  \u2014   eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life, they started a family. Their first child, Jos\u00e9 Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six   operations. That\u2019s where the angels came in  \u2014   the first one was a painting, a gift from a cousin.  \u201cWhen they operated on my son, they told me he was an angel, because he was supposed to die,\u201d Ms. Mu\u00f1iz, 50, said. \u201cFrom there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family. \u201d All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives, or picked up off the street, just like all the furniture in the Mu\u00f1izes\u2019 overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, much of it restored by Ms. Mu\u00f1iz. \u201cSo many people throw away things, so I don\u2019t have to buy,\u201d she said. A second son, Jesus, became epileptic at 3. A girl, Maria, completed the family. In 2007, Mr. Mu\u00f1iz had what felt like a horrible, stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. Mu\u00f1iz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. \u201cI\u2019m willing to take anything with him,\u201d she said. \u201cI never left him alone, and I never will. \u201d Radiation did not work. To save Mr. Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s life, surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured, depressed and unable to speak, he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs   care. This is the household where the Mu\u00f1iz children grew up. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through every craziness,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Jr. 24, who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment, \u201cevery up and down. \u201d For years at a time, the family held on, seemingly by a thread. Over the summer, the younger son, Jesus, 22, got a   job at a Zaro\u2019s Bakery in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. Because the family\u2019s rent is tied to income, the rent tripled in August, to about $770 a month from $245. But Jesus had school bills to pay, and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for Jos\u00e9 Sr. \u2019s mother, who died over the summer, and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. Mu\u00f1iz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times\u2019s Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent, got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from the Neediest Cases Fund, the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. Jesus is returning to college, where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic. Maria graduated in December from a   nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness, she wants to be an oncologist. Jos\u00e9 Jr. was just accepted to the New York Film Academy\u2019s photography program. But Jos\u00e9 Sr. continues to battle cancer. Zoraida is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family, sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. \u201cThey give me my strength, even if I have times I collapse,\u201d she said. Jos\u00e9 Jr. agreed. \u201cI use my parents and siblings as my motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all there for each other,\u201d Ms. Mu\u00f1iz said.'"}, "time": 1742628358.2960396}
