{"duration": 0.05960965156555176, "input_args": {"text": "'When \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d had its premiere, there was a clear line from Hillary Clinton to Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) the ambitious lawyer who came into her own after her politician husband\u2019s sex scandal. But the show had another Clinton figure all along: Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) who hired, befriended and ultimately fell out with Alicia. A leonine liberal not allergic to money or a highball of fine Scotch, she rose in a boy\u2019s club through alliances, compromise and knowing how much of herself to conceal. Diane begins \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d ready for a change. Like certain other people of her political persuasion recently, she meets a less happy kind of change than she was expecting. But for her  \u2014   and for this improbable but promising spinoff  \u2014   it ends up being an invigorating new start. The series opens a year after the end of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d in which Diane hauled off and smacked Alicia for revealing, in order to win a court case, that Diane\u2019s husband, Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole) had had an affair. Now, Diane is leaving her Chicago law firm and shopping  \u2014   alone  \u2014   for a retirement vineyard in Provence. That sounds like the premise of a typical TV spinoff (Frasier moving to Seattle, Rhoda to New York). But \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d does not find Diane struggling to grow a decent carignan or getting to know her quirky Proven\u00e7al neighbors. Her nest egg was invested with two of her oldest friends, Henry and Lenore Rindell (Paul Guilfoyle and Bernadette Peters) who plowed it into a Ponzi scheme. Effectively broke and jobless, she\u2019s forced to start over. She ends up across town, at a mainly   firm run by Adrian Boseman (Delroy Lindo) reunited with Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo) Alicia\u2019s old comrade. Other familiar faces include Marissa Gold (Sarah Steele) who returns as Diane\u2019s assistant the viperous law partner David Lee (Zach Grenier) and Charles Abernathy (Denis O\u2019Hare) one of the quirky judges on the original show\u2019s packed bench. By the end of its run, \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d grew so sprawling that it played like several shows sharing the same hour. \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d also run by Robert and Michelle King, doesn\u2019t reinvent the franchise so much as pare off a manageable chunk. It\u2019s still distinctive, though, for a new drama to star an actress in her 60s. The upgrade plays to Ms. Baranski\u2019s range, as she conveys both Diane\u2019s desperation and the will it takes to master and move past it. \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d pairs her comeback story with that of the newly minted lawyer Maia Rindell (Rose Leslie, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) who is dogged by her parents\u2019 scandal much as Alicia was by her husband\u2019s. She\u2019s the good daughter, guarded, shellshocked and a bit of an enigma. Lucca, meanwhile, often plays the sounding board for Diane, as if she and Maia were going halfsies on Alicia\u2019s role. Alicia herself is a sort of absent presence here. When Diane tells Maia why she\u2019s willing to take seemingly unsavory clients, she seems to allude to their falling out: \u201cPeople I thought with all my heart were guilty turned out to be innocent,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople I thought were saints  \u2014   they weren\u2019t. \u201d Basically, Diane is doing the same job in a different location, and so is \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d which will stream online on the CBS All Access subscription service. The first two episodes go online Sunday night, with additional episodes every Sunday. The pilot will show on regular CBS Sunday (edited for time and broadcast standards) after which CBS will have to pray that its traditional TV audience can find the internet. I can sum up how the move from network to streaming changes the show in one word. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a word I can\u2019t repeat here. Diane utters it about 20 minutes into the pilot it appears copiously thereafter. It\u2019s not as jarring as you might think. \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d had an unusual maturity and moral ambiguity for a broadcast drama now \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d has the expletives to match. (The episodes also run slightly longer.) The Kings often argued that \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d deserved credit for churning out 22 episodes a year for CBS, implying that the show might have been different if given the shorter season of a cable or streaming series. But \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d despite having 10 episodes, so far plays much the same  \u2014   the snappy dialogue, the technology obsession, the     structure. It contrasts with, say, AMC\u2019s \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d which established a different voice for a different protagonist. Consistency is no crime, but it will be interesting to see if the show evolves. The   firm setting, for instance, might shake up the often very white legal world of \u201cThe Good Wife. \u201d Also, with Alicia gone, \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d has a less direct connection to politics, with one early exception  \u2014   the universal exception, Donald J. Trump. The first episode, \u201cInauguration,\u201d opens with a scene (added well into shooting) of Diane watching Mr. Trump\u2019s swearing in, stunned. The surprise election result turns the series\u2019 premise into an unintended metaphor. Diane stands in for a certain breed of liberal who expected to be able to take a breather, the glass ceiling shattered, the gains consolidated. Instead, her financial ruin  \u2014   the scam, we learn, wiped out \u201cmany of the nation\u2019s liberal elites\u201d  \u2014   leaves her to claw her way back. Oddly, this makes the series feel more    than if it had aired as planned, during a triumphalist Clinton administration. Diane Lockhart would never admit this, but Mr. Trump may have done her a favor.'"}, "time": 1742628533.8394015}
