[The network has been taken aback by the response to booking Jones, the \u201cInfowars\u201d host who has questioned whether the killing of 26 people in 2012 at the school in Newton, Connecticut, was a hoax. NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said the story will be edited with the sensitivity of its critics in mind.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to get it right,\u201d Lack said. Reporters have interviewed controversial characters like Syrian President Bashar Assad and child molesters in the past without getting this kind of a reaction, Kelly said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cWhat I think we\u2019re doing is journalism,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bottom line is that while it\u2019s not always popular, it\u2019s important. I would submit to you that neither I nor NBC News has elevated Alex Jones in any way. He\u2019s been elevated by 5 or 6 million viewers or listeners, and by the president of the United States. As you know, journalists don\u2019t get the choice over who has power or influence in our country. \u201d Sandy Hook Promise, an   violence group, said it had asked Kelly to step down as host of its   gala in Washington. The group cannot support Kelly or NBC\u2019s decision to give a platform to Jones and hopes NBC reconsiders its plan to broadcast the interview, said Nicole Hockley,   and managing director. Hockley, whose    son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook, founded the organization with Mark Barden, who lost his    son Daniel. Kelly said she understood and respected the decision, but was disappointed. NBC\u2019s plans have cost it some advertisers for this week\u2019s edition of \u201cSunday Night with Megyn Kelly. \u201d It was not immediately clear how many only the financial firm JPMorgan Chase has been publicly identified. \u201cThat comes with the territory,\u201d Lack said. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual. We kind of know when we\u2019re doing controversial stories, that\u2019s going to happen. It doesn\u2019t stop us from doing controversial stories. \u201d To some critics, NBC\u2019s timing makes the decision worse  \u2014   airing on Father\u2019s Day an interview that has been publicly denounced by parents who lost young children at Sandy Hook. NBC said it was scheduled for competitive reasons, because Jones had been booked to appear on ABC\u2019s daytime show \u201cThe View\u201d next week. A representative of \u201cThe View\u201d said Jones had canceled his appearance there and he will not be rescheduled. Lack noted that he had suggested approaching Jones for an interview to David Corvo, the NBC News executive who supervises the network\u2019s newsmagazines. He said there\u2019s nothing new about putting people on the air even if they\u2019re unpopular or have views that are deplorable to many. \u201cI\u2019ve got tremendous understanding of why they\u2019re so upset, as they have every right to be,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re looking at the editorial process. \u201d The interview has put Kelly, who jumped to NBC from Fox News Channel earlier this year, squarely back in the headlines the New York Daily News called it \u201cNutwork News\u201d on its front page Tuesday. She was one of Trump\u2019s favorite targets during the presidential campaign because he was annoyed at tough questions she asked him at a   debate. Jones, for his part, has already denounced the interview as \u201cfake news\u201d and said it was purposeful hit job on him. \u201cI knew in my gut this was going to blow up in their face,\u201d he said on his show.'"}, "time": 1742564379.4769328}
