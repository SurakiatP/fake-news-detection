Don\u2019t call me party secretary. Call me \u201ccomrade. \u201d There is just one problem. In recent decades, the once ubiquitous term for Communist cadres and leaders has been embraced and popularized by a different group of people: gay men and lesbians. The term \u201ctongzhi,\u201d or \u201ccomrade,\u201d was a nearly universal form of address in China well into the 1980s, but as Mao jackets gave way to   suits and ties, it fell out of favor among Chinese officials. Among gay men, however, \u201ctongzhi\u201d became a term of affection and solidarity and eventually a catchall label for sexual minorities. A gay and lesbian film festival held annually in Hong Kong has been called the Hong Kong Comrade Film Festival since 1989. And the Beijing center for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people calls itself the Beijing Tongzhi Zhongxin  \u2014   or the Beijing Comrade Center. Even Google has caught on. Enter the characters for tongzhi guanxi  \u2014   literally \u201ccomrade relationship\u201d \u2014   into its translator, and it gives you \u201cgay relationship. \u201d (Baidu, the dominant   search engine, by contrast, offers the literal translation.) Fan Popo, a gay rights activist and filmmaker based in Beijing, said there had been episodes in which Chinese criticized gay rights activists for appropriating the political term. For some younger Chinese, however, the word \u201ccomrade\u201d offered a source of comfort for those who felt too ashamed to use the term \u201ctongxinglian,\u201d or homosexual, Mr. Fan said. \u201cBut now, people have really gotten used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the   on the bus  \u2014   the people who you would not really expect to know the modern lingo  \u2014   don\u2019t say \u2018comrade\u2019 anymore because they know what it means among young people. \u201d Nowadays, Chinese typically refer to one another as \u201cmister,\u201d \u201cmiss\u201d or \u201cmadame. \u201d Strangers often address one another as \u201cyoung miss,\u201d \u201cbeautiful woman,\u201d \u201chandsome man\u201d or \u201cmaster. \u201d Within the party, only top leaders are typically referred to as \u201ccomrade. \u201d At the lower levels, \u201ccomrade\u201d has been replaced by a grab bag of titles. In a commentary published last year, Study Times, a weekly party journal, railed against modern designations like \u201cdeputy secretary,\u201d \u201cboss,\u201d \u201cC. E. O. ,\u201d \u201cgrandfather\u201d and \u201cbrother. \u201d \u201cThese terms have not only destroyed the seriousness of democratic relations within the party,\u201d the commentary read, \u201cbut they have also affected the relationship between the party and the masses as well as the overall image of the party. \u201d After a meeting last month of the Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee, leaders issued a directive urging party members to eschew titles and honorifics in favor of the revolutionary throwback. The directive instructed that \u201cparty members must call each other \u2018comrades. \u2019\u201d Some political experts, however, voiced skepticism that the order would change much. \u201cThese days, everyone who joins the party does so to become an official and make money,\u201d said Zhang Lifan, a writer and historian. \u201cYou can\u2019t really call these people true comrades. \u201d There may also be an inherent contradiction. Last month\u2019s Central Committee meeting  \u2014   the same one that issued the order to party members to call one another comrade  \u2014   had another, bigger announcement: \u201cComrade Xi Jinping\u201d had been elevated to \u201ccore\u201d leader, cementing his status as China\u2019s central political strongman. \u201cPower is power,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cYou can say that all party members are comrades. But among all the comrades, there is still a core. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562302.776007}
