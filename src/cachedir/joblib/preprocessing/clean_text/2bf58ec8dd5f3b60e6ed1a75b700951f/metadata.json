In 2014, there were 4 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970,\u201d said Pew. \\n\u201cThis growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births. Meanwhile, the annual number of births to U.S.-born women dropped by 11 percent during that same time period, from 3.46 million in 1970 to 3.10 million in 2014,\u201d added Pew.'"}, "time": 1742628518.1281512}
