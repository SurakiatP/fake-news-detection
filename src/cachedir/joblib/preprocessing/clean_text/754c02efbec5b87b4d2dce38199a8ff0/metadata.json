The \u201creopening of the FBI\u2019s email investigation\u201d story blasted out by every hungry reporter and desperate Republican has already completely fallen apart. It took less than two hours. \\nThe initial headlines were as grim as they were overblown. Shortly before an official announcement, NBC News leaked the news that the FBI would be looking into newly discovered emails related to the previous Clinton investigation. NBC News: FBI re-opening investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server \\n\u2014 Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) October 28, 2016 \\nThis was important because despite Republicans hanging every last one of their hopes on Hillary being indicted before the election, the FBI investigation found zero evidence of criminal wrongdoing. A new investigation made all those dashed hopes come rushing back. They. Freaked. Out. \\nEspecially Trump. \\n\u2014 Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) October 28, 2016 \\nHowever, even as Trump took a meaningless victory lap, the story itself was falling apart. The bombshell turned out to be a dud. \\nOver on MSNBC, veteran reporter Pete Williams did what almost no other reporter bothered to \u2013 he got to the bottom of it. NBC\u2019s Pete Williams: Sr. officials say\u2014During separate investigation \u201ca device\u201d led to add\u2019l emails\u2013not from Clinton https://t.co/QmmNoxXhOx \\n\u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 \\nAll the \u201cbig\u201d things turned out to not exist. No, there is no evidence to suggest these new emails were covered up. No, they haven\u2019t found anything incriminating. No, this isn\u2019t a \u201creopening\u201d of the case \u2013 it was never closed to the begin with and this is a small update not a gamechanger. And perhaps most importantly these emails did not even come from Hillary Clinton . \\nBigger than Watergate? Hardly. \\nLike Wikileaks before it, this non-scandal will be used on the right to give the appearance that Hillary Clinton is \u201ccorrupt\u201d without providing any concrete proof beyond it. There is no big story here, but the conservative movement will use it as a pretext to continue harassing Clinton and her campaign with baseless accusations. FBI Director James Comey may have scored a few political points with his Republican colleagues, but his investigation will likely yield zero fresh controversies. \\nThis is the maddening world we live in. A sham built on a sham built on a sham. It\u2019s shams all the way down. \\nFeatured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562902.4309044}
