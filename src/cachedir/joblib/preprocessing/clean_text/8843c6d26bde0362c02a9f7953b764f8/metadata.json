Now, the company may be about to add to the list. On Monday, Gannett, publisher of USA Today, disclosed an   $815 million bid for what is left of the Tribune publishing empire. But instead of Tribune\u2019s board popping Champagne corks and shouting Hallelujah, it told Gannett, astonishingly, in effect: \u201cWait. We\u2019re not sure we want to do that and, actually, we\u2019re not sure we even want to talk to you about it. \u201d Two weeks ago and behind the scenes, Gannett made its bid, valued at $12. 25 a share, known to Tribune\u2019s board in the form of a private letter. That\u2019s 63 percent higher than Friday\u2019s share price. At most public companies that at least pretend to think about their shareholders, a firm that gets an unsolicited offer hires bankers relatively quickly to sort out its options. And perhaps it engages in a bit of    with the suitor in hopes of feeling them out and maybe getting an even higher bid. Not Tribune. Its board sat on the offer for nearly 10 days without retaining outside advisers. Then, Tribune wrote Gannett a letter saying it was still working on hiring outside advisers, but is \u201cin the midst of significant transformation,\u201d and pointed out that the company will \u201cundergo some change\u201d after June 2, almost six weeks from now. While Tribune said it would \u201cevaluate\u201d the bid, the clear takeaway was that it wanted more time. You might ask, what\u2019s magical about June 2? That is the day of Tribune\u2019s annual meeting. More important, it is the day that two of Tribune\u2019s board members step down. When that happens, Michael Ferro, an entrepreneur with next to no media experience who invested in the company earlier this year and became the company\u2019s nonexecutive chairman, will have effectively mounted a coup of the board. Here\u2019s how he did it. In February, Mr. Ferro\u2019s company invested $44. 4 million in Tribune. In exchange, Mr. Ferro was given a seat on the board, bringing the board to seven people. Mr. Ferro then persuaded the board to fire Tribune\u2019s chief executive, Jack Griffin, a media veteran, who was also a director. Mr. Ferro replaced him with Justin Dearborn, a former health care technology executive with zero experience in media. So, between him and Mr. Dearborn, he now controlled two seats on the board. He then pressed the board to expand to 10 people and added three people friendly to him  \u2014   all, again, with no meaningful background in journalism. They are Carol Crenshaw, chief financial officer of the Chicago Community Trust Richard A. Reck, founder and president of Business Strategy Advisors and Donald Tang, a former banker who now runs a boutique focused on United   media deals. So now he has five friendly directors on a   board. But after June 2, when two previous directors step down, he will have a majority  \u2014   five of eight. Tribune will tell you these directors are all independent. That\u2019s true only insofar as they are not executives working at the company. But they are certainly insiders relative to Mr. Ferro. If Mr. Ferro, who said this year, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t sell for $50 a share,\u201d according to Ken Doctor on NiemanLab, can get past June 2 without a deal, he will probably have the leeway to fully direct the process. He could choose to negotiate or perhaps he could stonewall. He could even try to take the company private himself. Who knows? Whatever the case, the idea that Tribune\u2019s board has allowed this sort of behavior to take place is alarming. Given that Tribune Publishing was just spun off from Tribune Media and itself was a product of bankruptcy thanks to Sam Zell\u2019s mismanagement of the company, it\u2019s hard to argue that this company deserves the benefit of the doubt. Lance Vitanza, a media analyst at CRT, put it best. \u201cTribune Publishing has little history operating as an independent public company and may be unable to reach earnings targets,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors. \u201cRecent management upheaval creates numerous risks with respect to strategy and execution going forward. \u201d If you\u2019re thinking to yourself, well, Tribune is a journalism company and simply selling to the highest bidder shouldn\u2019t be the only consideration, you\u2019re right. Tribune shouldn\u2019t consider only dollars and cents. In this case, Gannett is offering Tribune a lifeline with potential to create a modicum of stability. It is hard to believe that Gannett\u2019s offer is its last, or best. A company that is willing to go public with a bid is usually willing to bid more. Of course, there\u2019s a chance that Tribune is engaging in an inscrutable courtship dance that will land a higher price. We\u2019ll only know if Tribune first picks up the phone.'"}, "time": 1742561948.6741042}
