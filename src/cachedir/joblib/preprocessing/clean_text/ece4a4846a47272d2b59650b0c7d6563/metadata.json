Trump on Tuesday for his remarks in the aftermath of the shooting massacre in Orlando, Fla. warning that Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was peddling a \u201cdangerous\u201d   that recalled the darkest and most shameful periods in American history. \u201cWe hear language that singles out immigrants and suggests entire religious communities are complicit in violence,\u201d Mr. Obama said at the Treasury Department, without mentioning Mr. Trump by name. His statement, an extraordinary condemnation by a sitting president of a man who is to be the opposing party\u2019s nominee for the White House, came after Mr. Obama met with his national security team on the status of the American effort against the Islamic State, a meeting that the president said had been dominated by discussion of the Orlando rampage. \u201cWhere does this stop?\u201d Mr. Obama said of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach, noting that Mr. Trump had proposed a ban on admitting Muslims into the United States, and that the Orlando assailant, like perpetrators of previous domestic terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif. and Fort Hood, Tex. was an American citizen. \u201cAre we going to start treating all   differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating against them because of their faith?\u201d Mr. Obama asked, his voice rising with frustration. \u201cDo Republican officials actually agree with this? Because that\u2019s not the America we want  \u2014   it doesn\u2019t reflect our democratic ideals. It won\u2019t make us more safe. It will make us less safe. \u201d Appearing in Pittsburgh as Mr. Obama spoke, Hillary Clinton gave a blistering denunciation of her own. She echoed many of the president\u2019s points and even some of his language, assailing Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament, ridiculing his proposals and arguing forcefully that he had failed to meet the gravity of the moment. \u201cHistory will remember what we do in this moment,\u201d she told hundreds of supporters inside a union hall, asking \u201cresponsible Republican leaders\u201d to join her in condemning Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat Donald Trump is saying is shameful. \u201d Her   speech was a    rebuttal to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks a day earlier, when he issued a searing broadside implying that all Muslim immigrants posed a threat to American security. The nearly simultaneous condemnations of Mr. Trump from the president and the presumptive Democratic nominee to succeed him had the feel of a coordinated assault, although the White House insisted there had been no preplanning. Mr. Trump, unbowed by the criticism, said Mr. Obama was coddling terrorists. \u201cPresident Obama claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies and, for that matter, the American people,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWhen I am president, it will always be America first. \u201d Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s party were themselves critical of his rhetoric and proposals. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the nation\u2019s   elected Republican, said at a news conference Tuesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants was not in the country\u2019s interests, nor did it reflect the principles of his party. \u201cThere\u2019s a really important distinction that every American needs to keep in mind: This is a war with radical Islam. It\u2019s not a war with Islam,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThe vast, vast majority of Muslims in this country and around the world are moderate, they\u2019re peaceful, they\u2019re tolerant, and so they\u2019re among our best allies, among our best resources in this fight against radical Islamic terrorism. \u201d Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who has been among the most outspoken in his party about withholding his endorsement of Mr. Trump, said in a Twitter post that he was \u201cappreciative\u201d that Mr. Ryan had spoken out. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, flatly refused to talk about his party\u2019s presidential nominee on Tuesday, an indication of the precarious position in which Mr. Trump has placed Republican elected officials. Mr. Obama bitterly rejected criticism from Mr. Trump and other Republicans about his steadfast refusal to use the term \u201cradical Islam\u201d to describe the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone out there who thinks we\u2019re confused about who our enemies are, that would come as a surprise to the thousands of terrorists who we\u2019ve taken off the battlefield,\u201d Mr. Obama said at the Treasury. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic to the phrase \u2018radical Islam.\u2019 It\u2019s a political talking point. It\u2019s not a strategy. \u201d Mrs. Clinton echoed the idea, asking pointedly in her speech: \u201cIs Donald Trump suggesting that there are magic words that once uttered will stop terrorists from coming after us?\u201d The president said he would not use the wording because he was unwilling to give the Islamic State the victory of acceptance of its vision that it is the leader of a holy war between Islam and the West. \u201cIf we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with a broad brush and imply that we are at war with an entire religion, then we are doing the terrorists\u2019 work for them,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama is scheduled to travel to Orlando on Thursday to visit with the surviving victims and the families of those killed in the rampage on Sunday morning. He was to have traveled to Wisconsin on Wednesday for his first campaign appearance with Mrs. Clinton since endorsing her last week, but the event was canceled in light of the shooting. Still, Tuesday\u2019s   punch left little doubt that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton plan to savage Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. The president was careful not to cast his criticism in political terms and never mentioned Mr. Trump\u2019s name even as he clearly targeted him  \u2014   at one point referring derisively to \u201cpoliticians who tweet\u201d  \u2014   and his policy proposals. Instead, Mr. Obama spoke ominously of the stakes for the nation\u2019s security, and its very identity, if the ideas espoused by Mr. Trump and many in the Republican Party are widely accepted. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through moments in our history before where we acted out of fear, and we came to regret it,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen our government mistreat our fellow citizens, and it has been a shameful part of our history. \u201d Mrs. Clinton, in a striking departure from her speech on Monday, when she refrained from saying Mr. Trump\u2019s name and said it was \u201cnot a day for politics,\u201d took direct aim on Tuesday at his penchant for conspiracy theory. She reminded the crowd that he was \u201ca leader of the birther movement\u201d questioning Mr. Obama\u2019s birthplace. After the Orlando attack, she noted, Mr. Trump suggested on television that Mr. Obama sympathized with Islamic terrorists. \u201cJust think about that for a second,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cEven in a time of divided politics, this is way beyond anything that should be said by someone running for president of the United States. \u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need conspiracy theories and pathological \u201d she added. \u201cWe need leadership, common sense and concrete plans. \u201d Mr. Obama staunchly defended his administration\u2019s approach to countering terrorism, listing gains that the United States has made against the Islamic State in Iraq, Syria and Libya: killing the group\u2019s top leaders, capturing more of its territory and whittling away at its financial resources. He also called on Congress to enact gun restrictions that it has so far resisted, including the resurrection of a ban on assault weapons and a measure that would bar people on \u201c \u201d lists because of suspected terrorist ties from buying a gun. \u201cEnough talking about being tough on terrorism,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cActually be tough on terrorism and stop making it as easy as possible for terrorists to buy assault weapons. \u201d The last time a president so aggressively injected himself into the race to succeed him was in 2000. But Bill Clinton\u2019s criticism of George W. Bush, the governor of Texas and the Republican nominee that year, illustrates just how jarringly different this race is from a normal White House campaign. \u201cHow bad can I be?\u201d Mr. Clinton said at a   that summer, mimicking the voice of Mr. Bush. \u201cI\u2019ve been governor of Texas. My daddy was president. I own a baseball team. They like me down there. \u201d \u201dEverything is rocking along \u201d he added. \u201cTheir fraternity had it for eight years, give it to ours for eight years. \u201d The ridicule, while tame by today\u2019s standards, infuriated Mr. Bush\u2019s father, former President George Bush, who warned that if Mr. Clinton \u201ccontinues that, then I\u2019m going to tell the nation what I think about him as a human being and a person. \u2019\u2019'"}, "time": 1742563864.2896726}
