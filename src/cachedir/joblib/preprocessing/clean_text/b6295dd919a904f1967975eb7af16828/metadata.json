The PR firm was tasked with promoting what the Pentagon called \u201cdemocratic elections\u201d in Iraq, ultimately earning over a hundred million dollars yearly. Part of the firm\u2019s job included producing \u201c fake al Qaeda propaganda films, \u201d the Bureau of Investigative Journalism recently reported . \\nDespite the PR operation\u2019s hefty price tag, the Pentagon seemed to have no issue allocating taxpayer resources to have these videos produced. But over ten years after the Iraq invasion, the Pentagon is now concerned about its past appropriations \u2014 at least part of them, anyway. \\nTen years after promising $15,000 bonuses to soldiers willing to re-enlist in 2006 and 2007, the Pentagon is now forcing California veterans to pay the bonuses back. \\n\\nIn California, the Los Angeles Times reports , \u201c officials signed up soldiers in assembly-line fashion \u201d in 2006 and 2007, outlining the \u201c generous terms available for six-year reenlistments \u201d to those willing to sacrifice their safety, leaving their homes, once again, to fight abroad in exchange for a large bonus. Now, the Pentagon wants their money back. \\nTo Get Soldiers to Re-enlist, the National Guard Lied \\nIn 2008, the movie \u201c Stop-Loss \u201d highlighted a reality few members of the public were informed about. \\nWith the growing involvement of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers who had already served in Iraq and Afghanistan for several tours were being asked to reenlist. Sometimes, these soldiers\u2019 term duties were extended forcefully via the government\u2019s controversial stop-loss policy , which allows the government to extend the period a soldier must spend on active duty involuntarily. \\nIn California, the state\u2019s National Guard began promising thousands of soldiers that they would receive $15,000 bonuses for going back to war. \\nNow, nearly 10,000 soldiers who took the National Guard\u2019s promise at face value are being ordered to pay the bonuses back plus interest charges. In some cases, their wages are being garnished to fund the payments. \\nThis issue was first brought up when veterans \u201c whose only mistake was to accept bonuses offered when the Pentagon needed to fill the ranks \u201d were the target of an investigation launched in 2010. \\nAfter receiving reports of improper payments, a federal probe found \u201c thousands of bonuses and student loan payments were given to California Guard soldiers who did not qualify for them, or were approved despite paperwork errors. \u201d \\nAs a result of the investigation, Army Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe, who also served as the California Guard\u2019s incentive manager, pleaded guilty to filing false claims totaling $15.2 million in 2011. He was sentenced to spend 30 months in federal prison, and three other officers who also pleaded guilty to fraud were put on probation. \\nBreaking the National Guard\u2019s promise to soldiers whose reenlistment depended on the bonus distribution, the California Guard \u201c assigned 42 auditors to comb through paperwork for bonuses and other incentive payments given to 14,000 soldiers. \u201d \\nIn September 2016, these auditors finalized the investigation, finding roughly 9,700 current and retired soldiers who had been given \u201c improper \u201d bonuses. These soldiers have been told \u201cto repay some or all of their bonuses\u201d since the probe was launched and the first cases were discovered. \\nAccording to the California National Guard, these repayments have recovered more than $22 million so far, compromising veterans like Robert Richmond, who now works for a construction company in Texas. He was an Army Sergeant First Class living in Huntington Beach when in 2006, he was asked to reenlist. \\n\u201c I signed a contract that I literally risked my life to fulfill, \u201d Richmond explained, adding that he only agreed to go back to war because he was told he qualified for a $15,000 bonus as a special forces soldier. \\nThe veteran had gone through a divorce after being deployed to Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003. Asked to consider the bonus to reenlist, Richmond thought the money was going to give him \u201c breathing room, \u201d so he agreed. In 2007, he was sent to Iraq\u2019s \u201c Triangle of Death, \u201d an area a few miles south of Baghdad known for intense fighting. \\nIn one of the hundreds of missions against insurgents he was a part of, Richmond sustained permanent back and brain injuries after his vehicle triggered a roadside bomb. \\nIn 2014, the California Guard headquarters contacted him, letting the former special forces soldier know he was being urged to repay the $15,000 bonus he received in 2006. If he failed to make the payment, the letter said, he would face \u201c debt collection action. \u201d \\nRichmond refused to give the government any money back, filing appeal after appeal. \u201c [Impacted soldiers] want somebody in the government, anybody, to say this is wrong and we\u2019ll stop going after this money, \u201d he said. \\n\u2018Support the Troops!\u2019: Code for \u2018Don\u2019t Question War?\u2019 \\nIn Washington, D.C., lawmakers have condemned the Pentagon, saying the soldiers were not at fault for accepting a bonus they were promised. \\nPromising to open an investigation into the enlistment bonus problem, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) called the Pentagon\u2019s demands \u201c disgraceful. \u201d \\n\u201c The Department of Defense should waive these repayments, \u201d McCarthy said in a statement . \u201c The House will investigate these reports to ensure our soldiers are fully honored for their service, \u201d he added. \\nRep. McCarthy says the government should not be demanding any money back from veterans in his statement. The California Republican and also argued that \u201c we are the ones who owe a debt for the great sacrifices our heroes have made \u2014 some of whom unfortunately paid the ultimate sacrifice. ?\u201d \\nInstead of using this opportunity to highlight the importance of safeguarding our soldiers and keeping them from engaging in unconstitutional wars that are only successfully sold to the American public because administrations lie , McCarthy celebrates these very soldiers\u2019 sacrifices. \\nUsing this discussion to repeat the traditional \u201csupport the troops\u201d line, lawmakers like McCarthy steer the debate away from what\u2019s causing these soldiers so much pain and distress, acting as if relentless war hasn\u2019t been the reason they were lied to. Instead, McCarthy and others are pushing the government to keep its promise without reevaluating how the U.S. government goes about irresponsibly sending these men and women abroad to fight insurgents who didn\u2019t pose a threat to Americans at the time . \\nIn the 1964 film, \u201c The Americanization of Emily, \u201d which was based on a novel written by a veteran who had been a SeaBee officer on D-Day, character Lt. Comdr. Charles E. Madison gives a short speech explaining that \u201c [those] who make heroes of our dead and shrines of our battlefields \u2026 perpetuate war by exalting its sacrifices. \u201d \\nFailing to discuss the real costs of war with the American electorate while exalting the sacrifices made by those who serve in the military is part of an ongoing campaign \u2014 deliberate or otherwise \u2014 to keep America involved in perpetual war. \\nDon\u2019t believe me? Don\u2019t take my word for it. Instead, read what journalist Randolph Bourne had to say about the country\u2019s thirst for war in 1918: \\n\u201c In times of peace, we usually ignore the State in favour of partisan political controversies, or personal struggles for office, or the pursuit of party policies. It is the Government rather than the State with which the politically minded are concerned. The State is reduced to a shadowy emblem which comes to consciousness only on occasions of patriotic holiday. \u2026 \\n\u201cWith the shock of war, however, the State comes into its own again. The Government, with no mandate from the people, without consultation of the people, conducts all the negotiations, the backing and filling, the menaces and explanations, which slowly bring it into collision with some other Government, and gently and irresistibly slides the country into war. \u201d \\nWar, Bourne concluded , \u201c is the health of the state. \u201d This is not because all individuals involved with governing enjoy death and destruction per se, but because \u201c it is \u2026 in war that the urgency for union seems greatest, and the necessity for universality seems most unquestioned, \u201d which forces the public to unite behind the state no matter what \u2014 especially if the occasion leading to war is \u201c terrifying \u201d the public. \\nWhile veterans whose bonuses are being questioned ten years later should be heard and protected from government abuse, we must not forget it was government\u2019s own thirst for war that initiated this cycle of deception. Let us not ignore the reasons why we should support our troops \u2014 and how we should go about it; simply claiming to be interested in celebrating U.S. soldiers for their sacrifice does nothing for them. \\nBy Allice Salles / theAntiMedia.org The US Military Lied to Thousands of Soldiers \u2014 and Now Veterans Are Paying for It'"}, "time": 1742564617.8178546}
