They are heavily armed, using pepper spray in aggressive ways that it is not supposed to be used, using tasers and violence. (image by Unicorn RIot TV) License DMCA - Advertisement - \\nI hope millions internationally see how North Dakota and the corporations are treating the people whose only crime was that they were here first. \\nI don't know what the solution really is, other than Obama ordering a complete cessation of the pipeline construction. Bernie Sanders has made clear that he supports the native defenders and wants to put a stop to the Dakota Access Pipeline. He is only one Senator: ask yours to help soon! \\nThis is turning from an outrage to a massive sense of shame for what our nation is becoming. - Advertisement -\""}, "time": 1742561839.348048}
