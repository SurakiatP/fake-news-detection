They say the inmate harmed himself, but their actions were caught on video. \\nMilton Gibbs, 52, Terrance Bailey, 30, and Shaun Lowe, 26, are facing charges of aggravated assault, conspiracy, and tampering with public records. There are also additional charges of misdemeanor, recklessly endangering another person, unsworn falsification to authorities, and obstructing the administration of law and official oppression. They turned themselves in for arrest on Wednesday. \\n\u201cWe cannot stand for any kind of assault, and this attack on a handcuffed inmate by sworn corrections officers is egregious. Every inmate who is held in our prisons deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,\u201d Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said in statement following arrests of the three guards. \\nAccording to the investigation, the assault at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center dates back to June, when Gibbs allegedly threatened inmate Brandon Kulb, 22, stating that he would \u201chang him and murder him.\u201d \\nIt is alleged that Gibbs called Bailey, and the two then entered Kulb\u2019s cell and began beating, kicking, and spitting on him. \\nDistrict Attorney Williams says they eventually put Kulb in handcuffs and walked him down a staircase, while continuing to beat him. \\n\u201cOnce they arrived at the cell block\u2019s exit, Bailey struck the victim in the back of the head knocking him to the ground. Gibbs and Bailey then dragged the victim into the central control area and began to stomp on him. Lowe arrived on scene and joined in the assault,\u201d the DA\u2019s office said in a press release, adding that Kulb \u201clost consciousness\u201d at least twice during that time. \\nThe guards tried to make sure that the assault would not get captured on surveillance cameras, but \u201cmuch\u201d of it was still caught on CCTV, offering the investigation irrefutable evidence. Despite that, guards tried to cover up the assault. \\nAfter the purported beating of Kulb, Gibbs and Bailey submitted a mental health referral saying the inmate had intentionally harmed himself. Lowe allegedly transported the victim to the receiving room, and Gibbs tried to coerce the victim not to report the incident in exchange for food from the staff kitchen, the DA said. \\nIn their reports, the three wrote that they only used \u201copen hand\u201d control, because they had to subdue Kulb. They omitted their own actions. \\nThis is not the first time Gibbs has been arrested, according to NewsWorks. In 2004, he was reportedly fired for assaulting an inmate but was acquitted in a federal civil rights case filed against him. \\nVia RT .
