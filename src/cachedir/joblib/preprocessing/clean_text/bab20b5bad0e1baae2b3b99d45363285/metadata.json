However, Trey Gowdy just obliterated the criticisms while also delivering a nasty surprise directly to Hillary herself. \\nThe Democrats have come unhinged as they watch their candidate sink, with the FBI\u2019s reopened investigation delivering a devastating blow to an already disastrous campaign. In fact, what\u2019s coming out of their mouths as they enter panic mode is almost laughable. Take for instance Howard Dean\u2019s claim that Comey is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin or Harry Reid\u2019s suggestion that director Comey broke the law. \\nIt\u2019s rather ironic that he\u2019s concerned about Comey following the law while, at the same time, basically suggesting Hillary should get a free pass. In fact, Reid is so concerned about the FBI director\u2019s actions in investigating Hillary Clinton\u2019s criminality that he had the nerve to write Comey, attempting to intimidate him. \u201cI am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThrough your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.\u201d \\nLuckily for us, Trey Gowdy was ready to call Reid out for his crap, and of course, it\u2019s all on video for us to enjoy. Watch: \\nGowdy wasn\u2019t falling for the left\u2019s excuses, and he said what we were all thinking. First, he laid into Huma Abedin\u2019s excuse that she didn\u2019t know how her emails could have ended up on a device she says belongs to her husband. As Gowdy points out, there aren\u2019t that many ways it could happen, but it\u2019s rather irrelevant since that\u2019s not what the FBI is investigating. \\nNext, Gowdy took out John Podesta for his \u201cblame the cops\u201d play, and then came the nasty surprise for Hillary. Gowdy reminded viewers that Comey isn\u2019t responsible for a single one of the facts , saying, \u201c He didn\u2019t tell her to use a private server, he didn\u2019t tell Huma not to turn over all of her devices, and God knows, he didn\u2019t tell Anthony Weiner to send sexually explicit texts to allegedly underage people. \u201d Gowdy continued to put Hillary on blast, saying \u201c The timing is a direct and natural consequence of decisions Hillary Clinton made ,\u201d reminding everyone of where our focus and blame should be. But, he wasn\u2019t done there. \\nIt was then Harry Reid\u2019s turn to feel the Gowdy heat as the senator ripped into Reid\u2019s asinine letter to Comey. \u201cThank God he\u2019s leaving is my initial reaction,\u201d Gowdy said about Reid before adding, \u201cMy second reaction is: I did not know Mormons used drugs, and anyone who is capable of sending out that press release has to be under the influence of something.\u201d \\nThen, Gowdy went right back to putting the attention and blame where it needs to be \u2014 on Hillary Clinton. \u201c The person responsible for this fact pattern is Secretary Clinton ,\u201d Gowdy explained. \u201cJim Comey did not tell her to use her private server. He did not say to mislead the public about whether or not you turned over all of your work emails. And he certainly didn\u2019t say, Secretary Clinton, why don\u2019t you say you neither sent nor received classified information.\u201d \\nTrey Gowdy successfully obliterated any critics of the FBI and director James Comey while also delivering Hillary the nasty surprise she deserves. Although she\u2019s used to skirting consequences, she has no one to blame for what\u2019s happening besides herself, and it\u2019s nice to see that there are those in Washington, D.C., who are more than willing to wrap up some personal accountability and drop it directly into the presidential candidate\u2019s lap. Timing wouldn\u2019t be an issue if her own actions didn\u2019t lead our entire country down this path. Hillary Clinton has no one but herself to blame for what she\u2019s facing. As for timing, now maybe Mrs. Clinton has a little idea what it\u2019s like to be aborted just days before delivery.'"}, "time": 1742563172.4568594}
