This seat, for the first time in US history, was stolen from one president and delivered to the next, with the hope of packing the court to the far right. And with Gorsuch, we\u2019re talking to the very far right. \u201d Merkley further said that if Gorsuch was principled, \u201che would have turned down this nomination, on the basis that the person who should be nominated is Merrick Garland. \u201d He later added, \u201c[I]f one doesn\u2019t care about the integrity of the court, and you just want to look at this nominee from a judicial perspective, we have two other significant problems with him. The first is that the president\u2019s team is under investigation for having potentially interfered in the US presidential election. If that turns out to be true, that is traitorous conduct. And that means that this conversation should be set aside until that is cleared up. And the second is, Gorsuch is way out of the mainstream. He hates class action lawsuits. He doesn\u2019t want the LGBT community to be able to use the courts to end discrimination. He finds and twists a lot to find corporations  \u2014   for corporations against ordinary citizens time after time after time. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561706.9126577}
