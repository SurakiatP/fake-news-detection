(Photo by Reuters) \\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is pushing for its biggest military buildup near Russian borders, as the Western military alliance continues to harbor perceptions of a Russian \u201cthreat\u201d since the days of the Cold War. \\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will discuss the plan for military deployments to the Baltic states and eastern Poland at a two-day meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. \\nThe military alliance aims to send \u201cbattle groups\u201d to the Baltic states and Poland early next year. The groups will consist of 40,000 forces. It will be the biggest military buildup near Russia since the Second World War. More forces would also be deployed if necessary. \\n\u201cThis is credible deterrence. Not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent conflict,\u201d Stoltenberg claimed contradictorily on Tuesday, referring to the planned deployments near Russia. \u201cConcrete proof that NATO can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies. And a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.\u201d \\nThe United States, Germany, Britain, and Canada have already agreed to contribute forces to the \u201cbattle groups,\u201d which are to be deployed to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.

The Iskander-M cruise missiles are capable of hitting targets across Poland and the Baltics. \\nNATO was formed during the Cold War as a means of countering the former Soviet Union. \\nThe military alliance suspended all ties with Moscow in April 2014, after the then-Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula voted in a referendum to join Russian territory. \\nShortly afterwards, an armed conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine, areas inhabited by an ethnically-Russian population. The Ukrainian government, which militarized the originally peaceful unrest in the regions \u2014 known as the Donbass \u2014 has ever since been accusing Russia of having a hand in the conflict there. Moscow denies the claim. \\nThe conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 9,200 people and left over 21,000 others injured. Loading ... '"}, "time": 1742564523.111293}
