[In an interview with FOX and Friends, Pruitt said that \u201cParis [agreement] is something that we need to really look at closely. It\u2019s something we need to exit in my opinion. \u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a bad deal for America,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was an America second, third, or fourth kind of approach. China and India had no obligations under the agreement until 2030. We   all of our costs. \u201d Pruitt\u2019s comments increase the likelihood the U. S. will pull out of the agreement, which requires governments to present national plans to reduce emissions to limit global temperature rise, as well as regularly report on their progress. Pruitt has previously referred to the agreement as a \u201cbad deal,\u201d but has never openly called for America to quit. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump was a prominent critic of the deal, promising to \u201ccancel\u201d it, and this week he refused to sign a statement endorsing the agreement. Although Trump could not instantly pull America out, he could initiate the process for the country\u2019s exit. Since taking office, Trump has revoked a range of environmental legislation \u2014  including Barack Obama\u2019s climate orders \u2014  with a plan to focus on energy independence and revitalize the coal industry. In his first White House budget, Trump also proposed a 31 percent cut to the EPA\u2019s overall budget. However, reports in March suggested that members of Trump\u2019s senior team were divided over pulling out of the deal, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his own daughter Ivanka advising him not to pull the plug over concerns it would upset major allies. On Thursday, Energy Secretary Rick Perry confirmed that his department is conducting a review of all energy policy, adding that it was \u201cthe right to do. \u201d You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742562025.3761573}
