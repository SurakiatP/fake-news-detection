(Photo by AFP) \\nThe moon\u2019s distance from Earth varies because it is in an egg-shaped, not circular, orbit around the planet. \\nSince the moon\u2019s orbit is elliptical, one side (perigee) is about 50,000 kilometers closer to Earth than the other (apogee). \\nThe word syzygy is the scientific term used for when the Earth, sun, and moon line up as the moon orbits Earth. \\nWhen perigee-syzygy of the Earth-moon-sun system occurs and the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun, we get a perigee moon, which is more commonly known as supermoon. \\nThis coincidence already happened one time on October 16. \\nOn November 14 and December 14, it happens again, as the moon becomes full on the same day as perigee. On November 14, it becomes full within about two hours of perigee\u2014arguably making it an extra -supermoon. \\nThe full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016 but also the closest full moon to date in the 21st century. \\nThe next time a full moon comes this close to Earth will be November 25, 2034.
