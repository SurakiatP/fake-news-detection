Thomas Fuller, the  San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times, provides today\u2019s introduction with news of an unusual   initiative in the Bay Area. Oakland hosts millions of visitors every year for its sports events, thriving restaurant scene and growing technology businesses. The city also gets lots of    johns who prowl the streets for sex. Of the 660 arrests made last year for prostitution in Oakland, more than   of the suspects came from outside the city. On Saturday, Oakland is taking an unconventional step in fighting its image as one of America\u2019s most   cities, introducing a website, reportjohn. org, that city authorities hope will deter customers of the sex trade. Residents will be encouraged to note down the license plate numbers of suspected johns\u2019 vehicles and describe the specific activity they witnessed. The sightings are uploaded to the police, who will send a letter to the address where the vehicle is registered. Karely Ordaz Salto, the chairwoman of the city\u2019s Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Task Force, says Oakland is the first city to target johns in this way. \u201cThe hope is that they will think twice and this will deter them,\u201d said Lt. Jill Encinias of the Oakland Police Department. \u201cWe really need to attack this problem from all sides. We need to start focusing on the demand. \u201d The first question in the online form gets straight to the point: \u201cDo you have any photos of the activity?\u201d The city\u2019s problem with prostitution, and especially the involvement of girls, has been underscored this year by a scandal in its police department involving a young prostitute who claimed that she had had sex with officers and said the police had tipped her off to raids. The scandal led to the departure of three police chiefs in less than two weeks. The predecessor to reportjohn. org was a program called Dear John, introduced in 2013, which allowed residents to fill out a form that they submitted to the police. That program generated more than 300 \u201cDear John\u201d letters mailed to the owners of the vehicles spotted by residents. The police department considered it such a success that the authorities wanted to move it to an online format. Although the program could conceivably lead to foul play  \u2014   vendettas by jilted lovers or disgruntled neighbors come to mind  \u2014   Lieutenant Encinias said there had been no signs of false reporting in the Dear John program. That said, stay tuned for reaction from civil liberties groups. \u201cThis has historically been something that people thought they could do in the shadows,\u201d said Erica Terry Derryck, a spokeswoman for Mayor Libby Schaaf. \u201cThe intent is to put people on notice. \u201d \u2022 No, the federal government does not have plans to kill 45, 000 wild horses in the western United States.

That\u2019s the idea behind two new   crosswalk designs in downtown Santa Monica. The city hired two artists, armed with buckets of boldly colored paints, to create the artworks this week as part of an effort to delight pedestrians, said Constance Farrell, a city spokeswoman. The Federal Highway Administration actually frowns on crosswalk art, calling them distracting. But that hasn\u2019t stopped a bunch of municipalities from doing it, anyway. Long Beach, West Hollywood and San Francisco are among the cities that have colored their crosswalks in recent years, though perhaps not quite on so grand a scale as Santa Monica. One of the designs fills the entire intersection at one of the city\u2019s 12 new \u201cscramble crosswalks\u201d  \u2014   the kind that lets you cross the street every which way, including diagonally. Counter to the government\u2019s recommendations, Ms. Farrell suggested that the bright colors would improve safety by catching drivers\u2019 attention. One has to wonder, though, how long the sheen will hold up under an unending march of vehicle tires and footsteps. \u201cUpkeep is something we\u2019re monitoring,\u201d Ms. Farrell said.
