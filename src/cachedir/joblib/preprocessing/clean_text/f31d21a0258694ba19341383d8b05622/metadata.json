[MILO entered his Meme Mansion, packed to the rafters with anxious fans just waiting to get a glimpse of the Dangerous Faggot, with a large snake wrapped around his shoulders and accompanied by a number of large black men, \u201cWelcome to Cinco de Milo! I\u2019m Milo Yiannopoulos!\u201d announced MILO, \u201cI already have my own holiday, October 18th, is celebrated internationally as World Patriarchy Day. But that has been superseded now by Cinco De Milo. \u201d  MILO briefly discussed the events that lead to his exit from Breitbart before continuing, \u201cnow you may have heard that I made a couple of phone calls after all that happened, after I\u2019d been sufficiently contrite for a while. And you may have heard that I have raised twelve million dollars. \u201d the Dangerous Faggot said to the crowd that had begun chanting \u201cMILO\u201d over and over. \u201cI want to tell you all what I\u2019m going to do with that money so we can get back to getting trashed,\u201d said MILO, \u201cfirst of all, Simon  Schuster. I am going to spend the next year making the name Simon  Schuster synonymous with censorship. I am going to spend the next year giving out as many free \u2018Fuck Simon  Schuster\u2019 shirts as I can. \u201d MILO continued, \u201cdo not worry about the scolds and the nannies. So we\u2019re suing them  \u2026     I am suing Simon  Schuster for $10 million dollars. \u201d \u201cBut we\u2019re taking it a step further,\u201d said MILO, \u201cI am going to take not just all of their best authors but all of the best authors of all of the conservative imprints in this country and launch my own imprint called Dangerous Books. We are going to publish every mischievous, dissident, hellraising guy you have ever heard of  \u2026     We\u2019re going to be going live in the next seven days. \u201d MILO then announced the return of his touring career stating that he would be launching a student and commercial tour called \u201cTroll Academy. \u201d MILO stated that Troll Academy would be accepting applications on Monday from venues or colleges that wished to host him. MILO stated that personally would \u201cdetermine whether you deserve a visit from me. \u201d In his final announcement of the night, MILO discussed his Free Speech Week at UC Berkeley, which will take place in the fall.
