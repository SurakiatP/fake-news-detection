The Court of Arbitration for Sport said in announcing its decision Tuesday that the punishment by the International Paralympic Committee \u201cwas proportionate. \u201d Russia, the court noted, \u201cdid not file any evidence contradicting the facts\u201d on which officials had based their decision. The International Paralympic Committee had voted unanimously this month to ban Russia from the competition, which begins here on Sept. 7, after an investigation commissioned by antidoping regulators found that elaborate   violations in the country extended to its top disabled athletes. Russia has been a power in the Paralympics, winning 80 medals  \u2014   nearly 40 percent of the total  \u2014   at the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi, Russia. The decision of the International Paralympic Committee went beyond the sanctions imposed by the International Olympic Committee, which had considered but rejected a blanket ban on Russian athletes. The official who ran the   programs at the 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Games said he had swapped the urine samples of the country\u2019s top Olympians and Paralympians who were doping with clean ones. Forensic evidence confirmed a coordinated cheating effort by Russia, according to a report published by the World   Agency last month. The report concluded that the authorities, including the Sports Ministry, had covered up the use of   drugs by top athletes for years. When the International Paralympic Committee ban was announced on Aug. 7, Philip Craven, the committee\u2019s president, denounced Russia\u2019s \u201cthirst for glory\u201d and what he called its \u201cmedals over morals\u201d mentality, adding that Russia\u2019s antidoping system was \u201cbroken, corrupted and entirely compromised. \u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Craven struck a more conciliatory tone. \u201cIt is not a day for celebration, and we have enormous sympathy for the Russian athletes who will now miss out,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe hope this decision acts as a catalyst for change in Russia. \u201d The banned substances protocol for the Paralympics is different from that in the Olympics. Therapeutic exemptions are made for some Paralympians, but the use of anabolic steroids  \u2014   which Russia\u2019s antidoping lab director said was common among top medal contenders  \u2014   is unequivocally prohibited. The Russian sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, expressed frustration with the International Paralympic Committee\u2019s vote, calling the blanket ban \u201cbeyond belief\u201d in an interview with the Russian news agency Interfax. Russian Paralympians had participated a series of videos in recent weeks, seeking to persuade sports officials to let them compete. The number of Russian athletes at the Olympic Games here, which concluded Sunday, was affected by the findings of the recent investigation. More than a hundred Russian athletes were barred from competition. The country won 56 medals at this year\u2019s Summer Games, roughly a third fewer than at the 2012 Games in London. As the Rio Games approached, the I. O. C. considered a total ban of all Russian athletes. But it ultimately decided against what the organization\u2019s president called a \u201cnuclear option\u201d that would have resulted in \u201cdeath and devastation\u201d and run counter to the inclusive spirit of the Games. Instead, Russian athletes were considered tainted, Olympic officials said, and only those who could demonstrate a rigorous history of   testing were allowed to compete. In voting to bar all Russian athletes, Paralympic officials, who typically act in accordance with Olympic officials, had taken a bolder decision, which Russia promptly challenged in court. \u201cIt\u2019s an unprecedented decision,\u201d Mr. Mutko told Interfax. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s based on. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563018.5945427}
