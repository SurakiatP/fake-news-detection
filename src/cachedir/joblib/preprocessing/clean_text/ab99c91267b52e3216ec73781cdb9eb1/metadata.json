[The naval base would act as payment for Iran\u2019s support of Assad over the past six years of civil war, the unnamed official said.  According to the report, establishing an Iranian military presence on the Mediterranean Sea would be viewed by Israel as a \u201cradical step\u201d that would \u201cheighten the instability in the region and advance terror\u201d against the Jewish state. Such a measure would also increase the threat to the Israeli home front since it would strengthen the   terror group Hezbollah, which is currently fighting in Syria. On Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu relayed his concerns about Iran\u2019s intentions to build a naval base in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. \u201cI spoke with President Putin at length about the strategic significance of Iran\u2019s creating a permanent presence in Syria, or its attempt to do so,\u201d he said in a press briefing following their meeting, adding that an Iranian presence in Syria would be against the \u201c  interests of everyone except the Iranians. \u201d \u201cI said that it would undermine the stability, and actually hurt the possibility of a diplomatic arrangement [for Syria]. I made it clear that it is something that will be unacceptable to the State of Israel. \u201d Netanyahu said he believed Putin was receptive to his concerns. \u201cI made it clear to President Putin our resolute opposition to the consolidation of Iran and its proxies in Syria,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cWe see Iran trying to build a military force, military infrastructure, with the intention to be based in Syria, including the attempt by Iran to build a seaport. All this has serious implications in terms of Israel\u2019s security. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563577.7532902}
