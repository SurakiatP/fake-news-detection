And Raoul Peck, the director of the bold documentary \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d says that he couldn\u2019t have made his film, a current awards season contender, without her. Unknown to those outside Hollywood, the lawyer Nina L. Shaw is a secret weapon, a    power player adept at striking deals that cultivate freedom of voice, especially for black members of the creative class whose mission it is to be artist and  advocate. \u201cWhen I started making films, she was the first person I called,\u201d said Ms. DuVernay, the director. \u201cNot just for legal advice  \u2014   she\u2019s really a bit of a consigliere in all things. \u201d   and   enough to navigate the industry, Ms. Shaw is also someone \u201cwho really has power behind her punch,\u201d Ms. DuVernay said. Ms. DuVernay made waves by hiring only female directors for her television series, \u201cQueen Sugar. \u201d Lately, Ms. Shaw, 62, has also been outspoken about the inequities in her own field, giving speeches that pointedly ask artists to demand more diversity among the teams that write their contracts. \u201cYou can\u2019t just ask it of the people who hired you, you have to ask it of the people who represent you,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t there more women here? What\u2019s the plan for there to be more women here? I think that\u2019s a fair question. \u201d Despite strides in broadening onscreen and production roles in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite and other movements, the business side of Hollywood  \u2014   in particular the talent agencies  \u2014   remains \u201coverwhelmingly white and disproportionately male,\u201d according to a study released in February by the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at U. C. L. A. A flip through many of the entertainment industry\u2019s lists of power lawyers yields approximately the same results. Bert Fields, the longtime Hollywood lawyer, applauded an emphasis on diversity in hiring: \u201cSure as hell, there\u2019s more to be done,\u201d he said. But, he added: \u201cWhen it comes to selecting who I want to be my lawyer, I want the best lawyer for the price. I don\u2019t want to think about diversity in selecting who\u2019s going to represent me at a trial, or negotiate my contract. \u201d Ms. Shaw saw an obligation to do things differently. In her over 35 years as an entertainment lawyer, she was often the only woman or person of color in a meeting like many of her contemporaries, she has stories of male colleagues who asked her to fetch coffee or hang coats. Early on, she said, \u201cI actually felt things were going to change. I thought there would be lots of women in law firms and lots of women in agencies. And I\u2019ve come to realize that that\u2019s not the case, and if it\u2019s going to happen, I\u2019m going to have to be a big part of the change. \u201d Now, as one of the few women of color leading the legal side of show business, Ms. Shaw has become a beacon. A founding partner at the firm Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein  Lezcano  \u2014   where about half the lawyers are women  \u2014   her roster of clients includes Ms. Nyong\u2019o, James Earl Jones, Laurence Fishburne, John Legend and the writer   Coates. Projects with a social justice mission, which don\u2019t necessarily produce as many billable hours, stir her. \u201cI want to have been part of the work in this industry that makes society better,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to have left some kind of legacy here. \u201d Even through the country\u2019s current political upheaval, she said, representation in entertainment still matters, \u201cbecause ultimately the audience matters, and the audience is an inclusive, diverse audience. \u201d Ms. Nyong\u2019o shares that attitude. Suddenly in need of representation after her   debut in \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d she met with several lawyers before choosing Ms. Shaw. \u201cHer being   and being at the top of her game and having that cultural perspective on top of the smarts that it takes was very important to me,\u201d Ms. Nyong\u2019o said. With a multicultural upbringing and perspective, she added, \u201cI needed a team that appreciated that  \u2014   did not just see it but deeply understood it. \u201d Those teams and projects aren\u2019t always an easy sell. At a panel at the Albertine cultural festival this month, Ms. Shaw spoke about the studio and network programs meant to foster diversity in hiring, calling them out for their limitations  \u2014   a taboo subject in Hollywood. The programs, which are expanding, \u201care heartfelt,\u201d Ms. Shaw said in a separate interview, and worthwhile for grooming young talent. But, she added, they\u2019re \u201cmeaningless in the sense of, if you really want to hire people of color, there are a multitude of experienced people of color who you can hire. \u201d Asked why she had decided to discuss issues that might cost her industry relationships, Ms. Shaw said she was too grown to worry about the repercussions. \u201cYou get older, and you just reach a point where you say, \u2018I don\u2019t care, I am who I am, what I have is what I have,\u2019\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSo many people don\u2019t have control over their destiny in a way that I do, don\u2019t own their own businesses, don\u2019t have their own clients. I owe it to them to speak freely. \u201d Her steadfastness is practically  . In an interview in her Santa Monica, Calif. office, Ms. Shaw showed off a photo of her   Mary Catlett Hardy and George Evans Hardy, who studied at Oberlin College and became prominent citizens of Charlottesville, Va. where Ms. Shaw visited them often. They were assertive and   she said, and a big influence on her, particularly her   a descendant of slaves. (Ms. Shaw, who has the graciousness of a Southerner and the moxie of a New Yorker, started a scholarship at her undergraduate alma mater, Barnard College, in her  \u2019s name.) Ms. Shaw\u2019s background also gave her a deep affinity for the arts: A child of Harlem and the Bronx, she grew up going to Broadway shows and spending hours at the Met Museum. It gave her, Ms. DuVernay said, an uncommon appreciation for the artistic side of Hollywood Ms. Shaw is part of a small group of people Ms. DuVernay invites to critique working cuts of her films. Ms. Nyong\u2019o, too, has embraced her in her inner circle  \u2014   last year, Ms. Shaw joined her on a trip across Kenya, visiting Ms. Nyong\u2019o\u2019s ancestral home. Mr. Peck, the director of \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d based on the writings of James Baldwin, found her to be supportive of even his most   ideas. \u201cParticularly at that level of professionalism and experience,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople tend to be not reachable or cynical or not listening, because they have seen it all. And that is not Nina. \u201d It was she who helped secure Samuel L. Jackson as the narrator for his film, although Mr. Jackson has never been her client. (She knew his manager and agent, she said.) Sharp and elegant, Ms. Shaw also has a reputation as a tough negotiator, skilled in getting equitable deals for her female and minority clients, pressing the other side to explain why her clients won\u2019t get fair pay. At the Albertine panel, she quoted Shirley Chisholm: \u201cIf they don\u2019t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562880.5442412}
