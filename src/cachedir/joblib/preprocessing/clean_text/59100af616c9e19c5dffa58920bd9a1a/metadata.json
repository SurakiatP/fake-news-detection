[In his weekly Angelus message, the Pope reflected on the Sunday gospel reading that depicts Jesus transfigured before three of his disciples on Mount Tabor. Christ \u201cwanted to reveal his glory to his disciples not to prevent them from experiencing the cross, but to show where the cross leads,\u201d Francis said. \u201cWhoever dies with Christ, will rise again with Christ. And the cross is the door of the resurrection. \u201d  \u201cThose who fight together with Him, will triumph with Him. This is the message of hope that the cross of Jesus contains, urging us to courage in our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Christian cross is not a decoration for the house or a piece of jewelry to wear,\u201d Francis continued, but \u201ca reminder of the love with which Jesus sacrificed himself to save mankind from evil and sin. \u201d Sunday\u2019s Angelus was the Pope\u2019s first public appearance since returning to Rome from a   retreat in the Italian town of Ariccia. \u201cIn this Lenten season, let us devoutly contemplate the image of the crucifix, Jesus on the cross,\u201d Francis said Sunday. \u201cThis is the symbol of the Christian faith, the emblem of Jesus, who died and rose for us. \u201d \u201cLet us make sure that the Cross marks the stages of our Lenten journey to understand ever more fully the seriousness of sin and the value of the sacrifice with which the Redeemer saved us all,\u201d he said. Christ revealed himself to his followers as a different type of Messiah than they were expecting, Francis said, and this difference reaches its culmination in the apparent defeat of the cross. As Messiah, Jesus was not \u201ca powerful, glorious king, but a humble, defenseless servant,\u201d Francis said, \u201cnot a gentleman of great wealth \u2014  a sign of blessing \u2014  but a poor man with nowhere to lay his head not a patriarch with numerous offspring, but an unmarried man without house or home. \u201d \u201cIt really is an   revelation of God,\u201d the Pope said, \u201cand the most disconcerting sign of this scandalous reversal is the cross. But precisely through the cross, Jesus will reach his glorious resurrection, which will be final, not like this transfiguration which lasted a moment, an instant. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
