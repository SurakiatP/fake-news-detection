Researchers at the Institute for Studies found that speaker-phone chats were often about a hot guy from some cool party, a \u2018crazy\u2019 coincidence or work-related boasting. Professor Henry Brubaker said: \u201cSpeaker people want everyone to hear their conversation because they reckon the world is a soap opera in which they are the main characters. \u201cOften the person holding the phone is just repeatedly saying \u2018Oh my God\u2019 and laughing maniacally while the person on the other end says \u2018Oh my God\u2019 back. \u201cOr it\u2019s some corporate rubbish like \u2018Karl, KMG just caved in at the Didbury meeting, we\u2019ve nailed it\u2019.\u201d Speaker phone fan Mary Fisher said: \u201cSpeaker mode is handy for when you\u2019re driving or if you\u2019re on busy public transport and you want to let the entire bus know you\u2019ve just seen a massive cat. \u201cI just like holding the phone directly in front of me, it looks futuristic plus I can see my lovely chin reflected in the screen.\u201d \\nSave'"}, "time": 1742561894.3981624}
