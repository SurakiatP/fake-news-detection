[\u201cThere has been no effort to impede our investigation to date,\u201d McCabe said.  His comment came in response to a question by Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) about whether President Trump\u2019s firing of former FBI Director James Comey has impacted the investigation in any way. McCabe added, \u201cSimply put, sir, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people, and upholding the Constitution,\u201d he said. Democrats have accused Trump of firing Comey to stymie the investigation. The Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI\u2019s investigation had begun to pick up steam in the last few weeks, and Comey had asked for more resources from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told the WSJ that Comey last met with Rosenstein on May 1 and \u201cthere was no discussion of resources or funds related to the Russia investigation at that meeting. \u201d Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told senators on Thursday that he could not confirm that such a request was made, but said such a request would have been made to Congress, not through the Justice Department. \u201cIt\u2019s not consistent with my understanding of how we request additional resources,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563696.1706069}
