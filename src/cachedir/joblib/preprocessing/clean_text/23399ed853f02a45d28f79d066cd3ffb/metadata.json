I am sure that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the U.S. and we will bring them to ever greater heights,\u201d he added.   16, 2016 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is looking forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump on \u201cthe twin interests of peace and security.\u201d \\n\u201cFor when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:3 (KJV) \\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: After enduring 8 years of a pro-Muslim, anti-Israel president , you can well imagine Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s excitement at a Donald Trump presidency. At the same time, it will be Trump\u2019s very support that God will use to usher in some dramatic fulfillment of end times events. As we have been telling you \u2013 warning you \u2013 for over a year now, when Trump moves the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel, get ready to fly. We here at NTEB believe that the move will trigger the Psalm 83 war, or worse, and that the Rapture of the Church will then be right around the corner. If you have something you want to get done for the Lord, do it now. \\nIn a satellite address to the Jewish Federations of North America \u2019s annual General Assembly in Washington on Tuesday, Netanyahu urged President Barack Obama to continue America\u2019s \u201clongstanding policy\u201d of supporting direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, and not pursue other avenues. Israel is concerned that Obama will use his final days in office to push for a UN Security Council resolution that will impose a two-state solution to the conflict. \\n\u201cI, for one, find great encouragement in the fact that there\u2019s this continuity of friendship,\u201d Netanyahu said . \u201cI very much hope that President Obama will continue the policy that he enunciated,\u201d Netanyahu said, referring to comments made by the outgoing president at the beginning of his first term. \u201cThe only way you get a workable and enduring peace is to have the parties agree to it. This is what has happened with our peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan. PM Netanyahu Congratulates US President-Elect Donald Trump: \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had convulsions in the Middle East, and yet these peace treaties hold because they were directly agreed to by the parties,\u201d he added. \u201cThe reason we\u2019ll object to any such effort is because it will harden the Palestinian position, and because it will harden the Palestinian position, it will push peace back.\u201d Netanyahu added that he is hoping to nurture the recent \u201cquiet diplomacy\u201d Israel has had with Arab nations with the future Trump administration. \\nThe day after the Republican candidate rocked the world by winning the election, he invited Netanyahu to visit Washington at the \u201cfirst opportunity.\u201d The prime minister and president-elect \u201cwho have known each other for many years, had a warm, heartfelt conversation\u201d over the phone, a statement from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said . \\nNetanyahu responded by saying that he and his wife Sara were excited to visit the incoming commander-in-chief and his wife Melania. Netanyahu congratulated Trump earlier in the day, calling the president-elect \u201ca true friend of the State of Israel.\u201d Donald Trump vows to protect Israel: \u201cWe will work together to advance security, stability and peace in our region,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. \\n\u201cThe bond between the U.S. and Israel is based on shared values, shared interests and a shared future. I am sure that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the U.S. and we will bring them to ever greater heights,\u201d he added. \\nThe son of the late president Shimon Peres, Chemi Peres, also congratulated Trump in his speech to the Jewish Federations General Assembly. \\n\u201cI would like to wish President-elect Trump the best of luck,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sure he will maintain the unbreakable link between Israel and the U.S., at the core of which are the unwavering support of Israel\u2019s security and the forever-extended hand for peace.\u201d source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  '"}, "time": 1742562331.8568537}
