She asked them to finish the sentence \u201cI wish my teacher knew. \u201d The responses were   for Ms. Schwartz. Some children were struggling with poverty (\u201cI wish my teacher knew I don\u2019t have pencils at home to do my homework\u201d) an absent parent (\u201cI wish my teacher knew that sometimes my reading log is not signed because my mom isn\u2019t around a lot\u201d) and a parent taken away (\u201cI wish my teacher knew how much I miss my dad because he got deported to Mexico when I was 3 years old and I haven\u2019t seen him in six years\u201d). The lesson spurred Ms. Schwartz, now entering her fifth teaching year, to really understand what her students were facing outside the classroom to help them succeed at school. When she shared the lesson last year with others, it became a sensation, with the Twitter hashtag \u201c#iwishmyteacherknew\u201d going viral. Other teachers tried the exercise and had similar insights. Many sent her their students\u2019 responses. In her recently published book, \u201cI Wish My Teacher Knew: How One Question Can Change Everything For Our Kids,\u201d Ms. Schwartz details how essential it is for teachers and families to be partners. \u201cI really want families to know how intentional teachers are about creating a sense of community and creating relationships with kids,\u201d Ms. Schwartz said. \u201cKids don\u2019t learn when they don\u2019t feel safe or valued. \u201d Melody Molinoff of Washington, D. C. who has two sons, ages 9 and 11, in the public school system, agreed. \u201cParents see the teacher as their partner in bringing up their child, and that\u2019s a huge responsibility that we are putting on our teachers and our schools,\u201d Ms. Molinoff said. \u201cI always want my sons\u2019 teachers to know what their challenges are, what they like, just more about them. \u201d Mary Clayman, a   teacher in the Washington public schools, said she has noticed the same thing from the other side of the desk. \u201cI\u2019ve taught over 500 kids so far in my career and parents in every grade want to know how their child is doing socially and emotionally, often times more so than whether they can multiply or divide quite yet,\u201d Mrs. Clayman said. In her book, Ms. Schwartz writes about mistakes that might have been prevented if she had known her students better. She had a student named Chris who was obsessed with science. Ms. Schwartz thought she had done Chris a huge favor by securing a spot for him in a   summer camp. But she was unaware of the family\u2019s financial struggles and it turned out that his parents could not afford to take time off from work to get Chris to camp. Ms. Schwartz said classrooms can become a supportive environment for students coping with grief. She suggests that schools have \u201cgrief and loss\u201d inventories for students who have gone through a crisis, with input from families so that the child\u2019s future teachers know what that student is dealing with. \u201cAs teachers, we know parents are the first and best teachers for their children and we want them to work with us,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742564277.4898114}
