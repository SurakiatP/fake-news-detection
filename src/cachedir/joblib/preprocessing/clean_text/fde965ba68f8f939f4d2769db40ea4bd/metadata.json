Trump\u2019s admission that he had used a nearly   loss to avoid paying federal income taxes for years. They pressed for specifics, interrupting the candidates to demand concrete strategies for handling conflict in Syria and reforming the nation\u2019s health care system. And they posed blunt, provocative questions at a forum that typically feels more like public broadcasting than cable news: Had Mr. Trump ever sexually assaulted a woman? Did Hillary Clinton really believe that her use of a private email server was not \u201cextremely careless\u201d? The duo overseeing Sunday\u2019s presidential debate, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC News, seemed to cast off the   pressures on this year\u2019s crop of moderators  \u2014   Is   mandatory? Are interruptions O. K.?  \u2014   and put themselves directly in the mix of a   encounter. The immediate response was praise from many journalists and some grumbling from partisans. One prominent critic, in fact, was sharing the debate stage: Mr. Trump, who did not hesitate to make his complaints known in real time. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you bringing up the emails?\u201d he asked Mr. Cooper, after Mr. Trump believed he had been unfairly cut off. When Mr. Cooper replied, accurately, that the moderators had asked about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server, Mr. Trump threw up his hands. \u201cOne on three,\u201d he muttered, suggesting that the panel was siding with Mrs. Clinton against him. Later, Mr. Trump again questioned the umpires. \u201cYou know what\u2019s funny? She went a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her,\u201d he said to Ms. Raddatz, who had cut him off. \u201cWhen I go one second over it\u2019s like a big deal  \u2014  \u201d \u201cYou had many answers,\u201d Ms. Raddatz replied. Mr. Trump did face notably sharp questions about the recording that surfaced Friday in which he boasts about kissing and grabbing women. \u201cYou bragged that you have sexually assaulted women  \u2014   do you understand that?\u201d Mr. Cooper asked. When Mr. Trump dismissed the comments as \u201clocker \u201d Mr. Cooper pressed several times  \u2014   \u201cHave you ever done those things?\u201d  \u2014   until Mr. Trump finally asserted that he had not. The moderators also pushed Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Raddatz, discussing the candidate\u2019s paid speeches to Wall Street banks, asked, \u201cIs it O. K. for politicians to be  ?\u201d Mr. Cooper asked Mrs. Clinton how she could \u201cunite a country\u201d after dismissing half of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201cdeplorable. \u201d There were moments, too, where the moderators chastised the audience for cheering  \u2014   and sternly cut off the candidates  \u2014   as they tried to   the   atmosphere that seemed to quickly envelop the room. \u201cThe audience needs to calm down here,\u201d Ms. Raddatz said, turning to the crowd. When Mr. Trump interrupted Mrs. Clinton at one point, Mr. Cooper rebuked him, saying, \u201cShe didn\u2019t talk when you talked. \u201d Some conservatives were unimpressed. \u201cI may not care for Trump, but he beat Hillary tonight fair and square even with Martha Raddatz trying to defeat him,\u201d Erick Erickson, a   commentator, wrote on Twitter. One group that appeared shortchanged was the undecided voters sitting onstage, who, between the moderators\u2019 tough questions and the candidates\u2019 heated exchanges, received relatively little airtime. The moderators appeared willing to buck the debate\u2019s format when they deemed a particular interaction newsworthy or illuminating. This tactic was from the one Elaine Quijano used in the   debate last week, who often cut off candidates\u2019 answers so she could move to her next question. And the moderators eschewed the minimalist approach by Lester Holt of NBC in the first debate, who was less assertive and often remained silent for minutes at a time. If the first debate became something of a referendum on the role of the moderator  \u2014   to   or not to  ?  \u2014   the buildup to Sunday\u2019s event was more focused on the raucous nature of the evening. Mr. Trump, a temperamental figure under the best of circumstances, walked onstage Sunday facing a growing revolt within his own party and even his own ticket: His running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, issued a statement declaring that Mr. Trump \u201chas to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night. \u201d Walking into this fray were Mr. Cooper and Ms. Raddatz, experienced moderators both, who were already preparing for unique challenges. The choice of Mr. Cooper, who is gay, prompted grumbling among some conservatives, who questioned his personal politics. Ms. Raddatz was the subject of a Breitbart News report on Sunday scrutinizing her coverage of President Obama. Although Ms. Raddatz moderated the   debate in 2012, that event was seen by 51 million viewers. At the high end, Sunday\u2019s event was estimated to attract nearly twice that. Network executives were predicting a huge audience, in part because many Americans are home on Sunday evenings. But the extraordinary events of the last few days significantly raised those expectations. Last month\u2019s debate between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton was seen by about 84 million Americans  \u2014   a record for presidential debates, but shy of the 100 million or more viewers that typically tune in for the Super Bowl. Typically, the second debate sees a drop in viewers. Still, in 2008, the second matchup between Barack Obama and John McCain attracted nearly 11 million more viewers than their first in 1992, the second debate among Bill Clinton, George Bush and Ross Perot outscored the first by about seven million viewers.'"}, "time": 1742563166.1160238}
