And we\u2019re not doing anything about it.\u201d \\nHe added that it was \u201clazy American women\u201d who brought about the downfall of the economy, because \u201cthey sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we\u2019re here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cMark my words and mark them well,\u201d he addressed the crowd. \u201cHillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she\u2019s a woman herself and not just any woman; she\u2019s a self-made woman. So you better believe what she\u2019s saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.\u201d \\n\u201cSecond, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She\u2019s been all that and she\u2019s learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,\u201d Biden continued. \\n\u201cToday\u2019s women are pampered and aren\u2019t used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,\u201d the vice president said. \u201cThey\u2019re too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they\u2019ve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.\u201d \\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it\u2019s the economy that\u2019s missing out on valuable workforce. And that\u2019s why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,\u201d Biden concluded.'"}, "time": 1742562154.677023}
