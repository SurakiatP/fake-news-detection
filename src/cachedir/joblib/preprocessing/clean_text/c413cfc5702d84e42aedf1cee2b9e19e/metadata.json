It was heartening to hear, especially after his earlier assertion that it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to believe that misinformation on Facebook had affected the presidential election in any real way  \u2014   despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the mix, whether it directly swung the result or not. But as Mr. Zuckerberg went on to say that Facebook had to be careful not to mistakenly block \u201caccurate content,\u201d he added this: \u201cWe do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves,\u201d which was why he said Facebook would continue to rely on \u201cour community and trusted third parties. \u201d His statement pointed up how much Facebook struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a   utopia for its 1. 8 billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is defamatory, dangerous (like terrorist propaganda) and untrue. But more to the point, it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away. Do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting  \u2014   without basis  \u2014   that Hillary Clinton was involved in John F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s fatal plane crash in 1999 should be allowed to stand? Really? Truth doesn\u2019t need arbiters. It needs defenders. And it needs them now more than ever as the American democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase. With a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political threat, Facebook  \u2014   which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the online advertising market  \u2014   is going to have a special responsibility to do its part. Just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the 2016 election  \u2014   false narratives, fake news and aggressive efforts to delegitimize traditional journalism  \u2014   come back into play as Donald J. Trump presses to enact his agenda. If the past week provided any indication of where politics are going, the next four years are going to require an     effort to keep the national conversation honest. The national security adviser Mr. Trump named last week, Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that Shariah law is taking root in the United States (it isn\u2019t) contributing to his insistence that Americans have every reason to view Islam as \u201ca threat. \u201d He recently used Twitter to circulate a fake news item that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was sitting on evidence from Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop that would \u201cput Hillary and her crew away for life. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually. Then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that Mr. Trump had called to thank him and his radio and internet audience for their support in the campaign. Add to that the fact that Mr. Trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that President Obama wasn\u2019t born here, and didn\u2019t hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of Senator Ted Cruz was linked to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Then consider what it may look like when Mr. Trump pursues policies regarding Muslim immigrants and undocumented immigrants. It\u2019s not so outlandish to envision Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of Mr. Jones or a fake site out of Macedonia  \u2014   perhaps claiming that Democrats are working with ISIS to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such. President Obama seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in Germany on Thursday, \u201cIf we are not serious about facts and what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not,\u201d and \u201cif we can\u2019t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. \u201d Mr. Obama knows of what he speaks. He had to muddle through the first wave of this. You might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included   death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their \u201clevel of productivity to society,\u201d as former Gov. Sarah Palin put it (on her Facebook page! ). The false \u201cdeath panel\u201d allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over    care decisions. The accusations took on such power that even Newt Gingrich signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for    planning. (He explained himself in a 2009 letter to The New York Times.) News organizations, including this one, debunked the myth. But the bill\u2019s authors stripped out the provision just the same. And by then the \u201cdeath panel\u201d fiction had negated any shot at a reasoned, ideological debate  \u2014   you\u2019re joining the Democrats\u2019 plan to kill our infirm children and parents?!  As Dan Pfeiffer, who was the president\u2019s chief communications strategist at the time, so grimly put it to me last week, \u201cThe faux death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of truth. \u201d Things have advanced since then. Today\u2019s fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on Facebook or Twitter. (To wit: The one million shares of the preposterous notion that Mrs. Clinton secretly sold weapons to ISIS. BuzzFeed News  \u2014   which has excelled at illuminating the fake news problem  \u2014   highlighted that example in its alarming analysis  showing that during the campaign cycle fake news was shared among Facebook users more often than real news was.) That\u2019s why people who care about the truth  \u2014   citizens, journalists and, let\u2019s hope, social media giants like Facebook, too  \u2014   will have to come up with a solution to this informational nihilism, fast. It\u2019s easier said than done. The combination of attacks seeking to delegitimize serious news organizations and a drop in overall trust in the news media has made many people wary of legitimate  . And, as my colleague John Herrman noted last weekend, politicized voices can easily drown honest journalism all too easily on social media. There is growing talk of an ambitious journalistic collaboration to beat back the tide. Industry thinkers and leaders are coming together online to brainstorm solutions, as Jeff Jarvis, the City University of New York journalism professor, and Eli Pariser, the Upworthy   have done. (Check them out online.) And I\u2019d say it\u2019s high time that television news  \u2014   with its   audiences  \u2014   gets into the act with more than just token gestures at  . But this much seems clear: The moment calls for some sort of hyperfactual counterinsurgency that treats every false meme as a baby Hitler to be killed in its crib with irrefutable facts. So hey, Zuck, let\u2019s roll.'"}, "time": 1742563562.0227635}
