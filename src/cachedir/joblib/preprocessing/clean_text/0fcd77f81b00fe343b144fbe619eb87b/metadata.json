[In a Facebook post, MILO said that he is \u201cplanning to return to Berkeley to give the speech I was prevented from delivering. Hopefully within the next few months. I\u2019ll keep you posted. \u201d  The event, which was scheduled to be the finale of his \u2018Dangerous Faggot Tour,\u2019 was cancelled after rioters smashed ATMs and bank windows, looted a Starbucks, beat Trump supporters, pepper sprayed innocent individuals, set fires in the street, and as well as spraying words \u201cKill Trump\u201d on storefronts. President Donald Trump condemned the riots, threatening to take away the university\u2019s federal funding if the university \u201cdoes not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view. \u201d If U. C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view  \u2014   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?  \u2014   Donald J.
