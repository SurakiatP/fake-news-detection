Galleries have been popping up in the area over the last few years as some artists get priced out of downtown\u2019s Arts District and other areas. \\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who actually did [the vandalism], but because it actually made a reference to anti-white art or anti-white, it\u2019s basically saying that it\u2019s a hate crime based on that,\u201d Det. John Parra of the LAPD\u2019s Hollenbeck station said of a vulgar curse against \u201cwhite art\u201d that in one of the incidents was spray-painted on the Nicodim Gallery. \\nBoyle Heights has become a flashpoint as Los Angeles undergoes a wave of gentrification fueled by rising home prices and a renewed interest in urban neighborhoods by many. It\u2019s already transformed once-working-class communities such as Echo Park and Highland Park. But some in Boyle Heights\u2013for decades the heart of L.A.\u2019s Mexican American community\u2013have vowed to fight the change. \\nIn the last three years, more than a dozen galleries have appeared in the area , many in an industrial zone just west of the 101 Freeway. Community activists fear the galleries will inflate property values and push poorer residents out. \\nIn September, activists marched through Boyle Heights and posted mock eviction notices for \u201cgentrifiers,\u201d which included a couple of galleries. \\n{snip} \\nBut the three incidents prompted the Hollenbeck Division to call a meeting with gallery owners last week to try to get an understanding of the problem and come up with a plan, including attempting to open a dialogue with the activist group Defend Boyle Heights, which has been a driving force of opposition to the galleries. \\n{snip} \\nOn Thursday afternoon, Defend Boyle Heights issued a statement saying it was not responsible for vandalizing the galleries. \\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who tagged up these galleries, but we . . . certainly don\u2019t condemn it. It is right to rebel! We are glad to see the community rise up to resist displacement, art washing and gentrification\u2013however they see fit! Your anger is justified,\u201d the statement read. \\n\u201cGentrification is the true, highest form of hate crime!\u201d \\nActivists have demanded that the art galleries leave the neighborhood and allow the community to decide what will take their place. \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742564461.5459187}
