He was slim, attractive. I thought it was the usual flirting. But then I realized that his face did look familiar. Church. I\u2019d seen him at church a few times. So we chatted a bit. He wasn\u2019t a student there. He was there to see a friend. For some reason he also mentioned that his birthday was coming up. I gave him my phone number. He called me  \u2014   a lot. I never answered, and I never called him back. It went on like that for a month. Then one day, I looked at the date and realized it was his birthday. I decided to give him a call. From then on, we talked every single day on the phone. I have trouble sleeping, and we would talk almost all night. \u201cWhat\u2019s your genotype?\u201d he asked me in one of our first telephone conversations. \u201cWhich one is the genotype and which one is the blood type?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI\u2019m SS,\u201d he told me. Then I remembered. \u201cO. K.,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m AA. \u201d By then, I knew what the sickle cell trait was. Hemoglobin SS meant he had   sickle cell anemia. A family friend had lost kids to it. My school had tested me for it. But when he told me, I was like, O. K. sure. It didn\u2019t seem like a thing. We became very close. My mom knew about him. My siblings knew about him. But he was older. I was just 16. I had a strict curfew every night. He was in his  . One time, about a year after we met, we went to a cafe for lunch. It was one of those hot days before the rainy season would come and unleash showers across the Nigerian landscape. At the cafe, we talked as I wolfed down a slice of chocolate cake. We got up to leave, paid the bill and I hugged him goodbye. At some point in the hug, it happened. He was leaning in with his lips. I realized he was trying to kiss me! It would have been my very first kiss  \u2014   if it had happened. But it didn\u2019t. I was stunned. I was so upset that I just turned my face away and walked to my car. After I got home, he called me to apologize. I told him not to call me, but after two days I really missed talking to him. He liked me. I really, really liked him. I wouldn\u2019t call it a crush. A crush is like a joke. He was quiet, and he had a gentle soul. A couple of years later, when his birthday came around again, he said he wasn\u2019t feeling too well, so I went to his house. He lived with his parents, and I didn\u2019t really like going to his house, because it took a lot of lying to my parents to go there. We sat on the couch and watched music videos on MTV. The   boy band, the Wanted, came on with their song \u201cAll Time Low,\u201d and I got so excited because it was my latest obsession. \u201cI love this song!\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d But he just shrugged his shoulders. He was kind of indifferent. I was so na\u00efve. I didn\u2019t notice how sick he was. I didn\u2019t want to notice. I just kept talking and talking. I left after three hours, but after that I found myself checking on him constantly, every 30 minutes or so. He kept saying he was fine. But a few days later, he ended up in the hospital. When I went to visit him, it was a shock  \u2014   I had never seen a \u201csickler\u201d before. I saw the yellow eyes. I saw how skinny he was. He kept wincing from the pain, but putting up a brave act. \u201cThey\u2019re saying my kidneys are failing and stuff,\u201d he finally said. I was so freaked out. A few mornings later, I planned to go back and bring him some Ogbono soup, his favorite. It\u2019s a concoction of ground African bush mango seeds, cooked onions and crayfish with dark, leafy vegetables swimming in bright red palm oil. The plan was for my mom to make it but to say that I made it. So we began cooking the soup. Then we boiled water to cook semolina flour for fufu to go with it. All the while, I kept calling him, but he wasn\u2019t answering. So I called one of his friends, and we planned to go together. I packed the soup and fufu and drove over to his friend\u2019s house. When I got there, his friend told me to come in and sit down. And that\u2019s how I got the news he died. I wept all the way home, and every day after that. My father asked who the hell was this guy who just turned his daughter\u2019s life upside down. I would sit in my room with the curtains closed. For weeks, it just seemed like a good idea to sit in the dark. After the funeral, I had to ask one of his friends: \u201cDid he know how much I actually cared about him?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d came the response. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. \u201d I\u2019m still dealing with the guilt of that, because it seems to me he had everything I would have wanted in a boyfriend.'"}, "time": 1742562610.1710386}
