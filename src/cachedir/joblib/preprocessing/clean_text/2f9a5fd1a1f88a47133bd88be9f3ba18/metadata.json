[\u201cWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth,\u201d Trump said in his speech Friday morning after completing his oath of office. He noted in his speech that his foreign policy would also strive not to \u201cimpose our way of life on anyone else. \u201d  President Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama famously refused to refer to groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State as \u201cradical Islamic terrorists,\u201d claiming the term unfairly maligned Muslims who were not members of jihadist groups. The Washington Post notes that Trump\u2019s inaugural address was also the first to use the words \u201curban\u201d and \u201cinfrastructure,\u201d a nod to the core message of city repair and equality of opportunity in his speech. \u201cWhether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator,\u201d Trump told the crowd gathered in the heart of Washington, DC.
