[The Democrat mayor vowed after President Donald Trump was elected in November that he would keep existing sanctuary cities policies, reported Breitbart Texas. This comes despite the Obama Administration\u2019s Justice Department certifying the nation\u2019s largest city as a sanctuary jurisdiction in 2016. The city stands to  lose millions in federal law enforcement grant money, Breitbart Texas reported. The city could also be forced to repay more than $60 million in previously received law enforcement grants.  Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association said on a radio show Sunday, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the world is   right now. \u201d He added, \u201cThe people who are committing crimes they don\u2019t belong in the country,\u201d reported the New York Daily News. Mullins said police officers want to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. \u201cMake no mistake about it, the members of law enforcement in the NYPD want to cooperate with ICE. I speak to cops every day  \u2014   they want to cooperate with ICE, they want to work with fellow law enforcement agents. \u201d \u201cThere is a moral obligation, and as the chief law enforcement officer of the city, you yourself have to be able to follow the law. We don\u2019t get to participate in the laws that we want. \u201d That\u2019s total lunacy,\u201d he added. The New York Immigration Coalition (NYCI) tweeted out the Daily News article saying, \u201cNYPD police union boss says cops want to help ICE deport. Not on our watch. #NoBanNoWallNoRaids #Our NY\u201d NYPD police union boss says cops want to help ICE deport. Not on our watch. #NoBanNoWallNoRaids #OurNY https:  .   \u2014   NYIC (@thenyic) February 27, 2017,  The NYIC describes itself on its Twitter profile as \u201caim[ing] to achieve a fairer and more just society that values the contributions of immigrants and extends opportunity to all. \u201d Last week New York City Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill released an      memo to his officers that said, \u201cThe NYPD does not conduct civil immigration enforcement. Specifically, this department does not enforce administrative warrants issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents or federal immigration judges solely in connection with civil immigration violations. \u201d \u201cIt is critical that everyone who comes into contact with the NYPD, regardless of their immigration status, be able to identify themselves or seek assistance without hesitation, anxiety or fear,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. The New York City police commissioner elaborated in his memo, \u201cFor example, the NYPD does not arrest or detain individuals for immigration violations such as overstaying a lawfully issued visa. \u201d He said however, \u201cthe NYPD does and will continue to honor federal immigration detainers when there is a risk to public safety. \u201d Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John F. Kelly issued comprehensive reforms of President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration policies on February 17, reported Breitbart News. As reported, these policies restored the 287( g) program which provides for cooperation of state and local police officials with DHS agents. The program was stopped by Obama in 2014. Deportation of illegal immigrants hit a   low during President Obama\u2019s last full fiscal year in office, Breitbart Texas reported. The administration waited until the last Friday of the year to release its final FY 2016 report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal operations. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore people who commit crimes and facilitate an atmosphere of harboring them because we want to get votes in an election year. It\u2019s just terrible to do that,\u201d police union head Mullins was reported by the New York Daily News to say on Sunday. \u201cIf you\u2019re arrested, you commit a misdemeanor, you commit felonies  \u2014   why are we going to tolerate this?\u201d Mullins also put the onus on de Blasio and the police commissioner if any of his officers or a civilian are hurt: \u201cIf a member of law enforcement is killed or a member of the public is killed, well that public official that plays this game or that members of law enforcement that play this game, they better be prepared to answer for that. And this will no doubt some time along the line happen, because we\u2019re seen it happen across the country. \u201d \u201cCriminal aliens routinely victimize Americans and other legal residents,\u201d DHS Secretary Kelly wrote in a   memo obtained by Breitbart Texas. \u201cOften, these victims are not provided adequate information about the offender, the offender\u2019s immigration status, or any enforcement action taken by ICE against the offender. \u201d Secretary Kelly recently ordered the director of ICE to create a program (\u201cVOICE\u201d) to help those who have suffered at the hands of criminal illegal aliens, Breitbart Texas reported. The program creates a liaison and authorizes the disclosure of suspect immigration statuses and other information. Mayor de Blasio\u2019s spokesperson Austin Finan was reported to respond to Mullin\u2019s comments on the radio, \u201cThe City works with ICE to see that violent and dangerous individuals are deported. Neighborhood, precision and    policing have driven crime to historic lows, not the deputizing of police officers to double as ICE agents. \u201d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
