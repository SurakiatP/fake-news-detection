[Jenner, who previously praised Trump during a contentious election campaign, will be among the many   figures to travel to Washington, D. C. for the January 20 event, UsWeekly reports.  A   lifelong conservative, Jenner came out in support of   presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz in March, and even offered to serve as Cruz\u2019s \u201cTrans Ambassador. \u201d That same month, Jenner was seen on an episode of reality TV series I Am Cait calling Hillary Clinton a \u201cf*cking liar\u201d and a \u201cpolitical hack. \u201d \u201cI would never ever ever vote for Hillary,\u201d Jenner said during the episode. \u201cWe\u2019re done, if Hillary becomes president  \u2014   the country is over. \u201d A few months later, Jenner was praising Trump as possibly being \u201cbetter\u201d on women\u2019s issues than Clinton. \u201cEverybody looks at the Democrats as being better with these issues. But Trump seems to be very much for women,\u201d Jenner told the health magazine. Jenner shocked Hollywood and the world in June 2015 with a Vanity Fair magazine spread that featured the first photographs taken following the former Olympian\u2019s gender reassignment surgery. In a speech at the University of Pennsylvania in February, Jenner said that being transgender in Hollywood is easier than being a conservative Republican. Jenner later legally changed his name to Caitlyn Marie.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742563281.3418846}
