D. Power, which conducts consumer surveys, including an annual survey on car rental satisfaction (for the third year running, Enterprise has ranked highest). \u201cAncillary fees, as with airlines, are how the companies retain profitability,\u201d he said. There are a number of ways to save money on rental cars, including renting from a location that\u2019s not at an airport, which Kayak says will save you an average of 11 percent. But there are several charges that tend to nip renters\u2019 wallets after they return their cars that can be avoided or reduced with a little forethought. Assuming you haven\u2019t purchased any refueling options when you signed the contract, rental car agencies require renters to return the car with the same amount of gas as when they departed, which usually means full. But the mileage range between topping off the tank and reaching the return facility is a gray area. \u201cAt Hertz, we do not have a mileage restriction. We simply ask that customers refuel to the same level they started with,\u201d wrote Lauren Luster, communications manager with Hertz, in an email. This lack of definition is open to exploitation both from drivers who refuel miles away and from agencies. I recently returned a car to Avis in Miami after refueling a block from the airport return terminal, only to find a \u201cfuel service\u201d charge of $16. 07 on my bill. An Avis employee redacted it when I objected. A spokeswoman for Avis said the company has about 40, 000 \u201cconnected\u201d cars, which measure fuel levels when exiting and   the rental facility. \u201cWe carefully monitor the system and work closely with car manufacturers, so the likelihood that the technology in the vehicle malfunctioned is slim,\u201d wrote Alice Pereira, an Avis spokeswoman, in an email. Industry experts advise making a mental note of the closest gas station when you drive away from the rental facility. \u201cCars aren\u2019t getting smarter, we need to be,\u201d said Lauren Fix, an author and automotive writer also known as the Car Coach. \u201cIf you have a receipt to prove you refilled, they will usually refund the fee. Any pushback, I ask for a manager. \u201d Drivers are responsible for paying their own tolls, but a shift to electronic tolling has made it harder for renters to avoid the fees charged by agencies as manned booths have disappeared from many routes. Most agencies provide electronic transponders that allow convenient access to toll roads. But once they are triggered by a tollgate, the devices initiate a daily rental fee, often regardless of whether it is used each day. These fees are in addition to the actual tolls, so that while you may only incur a few dollars in tolls driving from Miami to Key West, you will pay somewhere between $2. 95 a day for the device at Payless Car Rental to $4. 95 a day with Hertz. These fees are usually capped. Avis charges a maximum of $19. 75 per rental month Hertz charges $24. 75 maximum per rental agreement and Payless charges $14. 75 maximum for each rental period. Enterprise, National and Alamo car rentals offer the use of automatic tolling for $3. 95 per day it is used, with a maximum charge of $19. 75 for the rental term. Car rental companies stress that drivers can pay cash (when the option exists) avoid toll roads or bring their own electronic transponders from home. Not all electronic passes are linked, however. The   can be used in most Northeastern and   states and a few in the Midwest, extending from Maine down to North Carolina and west to Illinois. An   may be used in various vehicles as long as they are in the same class as your car, so forget using it if you rent a  . Some toll roads in California will allow drivers to register a credit card to the rental car license plate and have the tolls charged automatically. Many consumers assume that an early rental return will spare them the fee remaining for the balance of the contract. That doesn\u2019t take into account the lost revenue that the rental car company incurs. \u201cIt messes with their inventory and planning,\u201d said Mr. Solomito of Kayak. \u201cReturning a car early is considered breaking the contract. \u201d How early is early depends on the company, but generally anything less than 24 hours before the return date requires payment of the full amount. If earlier, Dollar Rent A Car, for example, will only charge for the days used and add a $25 charge, according to the company website, \u201cto compensate us in part for our inability to rent your vehicle during the remaining time we have reserved for your use. \u201d Late returns generally trigger fees. And like airline rebooking, any changes may result in a different rate than the one originally agreed to. Hertz encourages customers to call its Rental Extensions department. They may be subject to a $10   fee, through renters can avoid the fee if they change a return date when they pick up the car. If they don\u2019t call, however, they can be subject to a fee of $12 a day, up to a maximum of $60, in addition to daily rental charges. Parking or traffic tickets are the driver\u2019s responsibility. But if ever there were a financial incentive to driving carefully, it\u2019s in a rental car, where ticket fees may come with a service charge from the rental company. These penalties are usually detailed in the terms and conditions of the rental contract. Avis\u2019s contract says offenses will be charged back to the renter\u2019s credit card, and the company may impose a $30 administration fee to cover the cost of notifying the renter of the infraction by sending copies of the notices. Payless charges a $50 fee per violation. \u201cWhat the big print giveth, the little print taketh away,\u201d Ms. Fix said. \u201cYou have to be aware. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561698.610048}
