Here\u2019s a brief snippet of what she said: \\n\u2018It\u2019s not about emails; it\u2019s about public communication by a woman\u2019 \\nI am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s us. \\nThe only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she\u2019s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. \\nIt\u2019s not about emails; it\u2019s about public communication by a woman in general. Of course, in the year 2016, no one (probably not even The Donald) could make this argument explicitly. After all, he and his fellow Republicans are not waging a war on women. How do we know that? They have said so. And they\u2019re men, so they must be telling the truth. \\nI know. It\u2019s really hard to believe the above is real, but it is. \\nMoving along, President Obama himself is now getting in the mud. \\nHere\u2019s what he had to say today in Ohio, according to NBC : \\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 President Barack Obama said Tuesday that sexism is to blame for the tight race for the White House, telling an Ohio crowd that \u201cHillary Clinton is consistently treated differently than just about any other candidate I see out there.\u201d \\nObama went on: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we haven\u2019t had a woman president.\u201d \\nSpeaking specifically to \u201cthe guys out there,\u201d Obama told them to \u201clook inside yourself and ask yourself, if you\u2019re having problems with this stuff how much of it is that we\u2019re just not used to it?\u201d \\nYep, because the American public handily elected a black man twice, but somehow we all draw the line at a woman. Perhaps, just perhaps, the problem is with Hillary. \\nMoving along, all this reminded me of a very prescient comment made by Glenn Greenwald a couple of years ago, which I highlighted in the post, Glenn Greenwald on the 2016 Elections \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019ll Probably Have a Gay Person After Hillary\u201d : \\nHillary is banal, corrupted, drained of vibrancy and passion. I mean, she\u2019s been around forever, the Clinton circle. She\u2019s a fucking hawk and like a neocon, practically. She\u2019s surrounded by all these sleazy money types who are just corrupting everything everywhere. But she\u2019s going to be the first female president, and women in America are going to be completely invested in her candidacy. Opposition to her is going to be depicted as misogynistic, like opposition to Obama has been depicted as racist. It\u2019s going to be this completely symbolic messaging that\u2019s going to overshadow the fact that she\u2019ll do nothing but continue everything in pursuit of her own power. They\u2019ll probably have a gay person after Hillary who\u2019s just going to do the same thing. \\nObama could\u2019ve gone out on a high note, but he decided to go low. \\nSad!'"}, "time": 1742628305.292838}
