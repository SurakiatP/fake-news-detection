Approach shots landed on greens only to be blown backward into ponds and creeks. Trees not normally in play became new hazards because wind bent branches just enough to put them in play and make them threats to   shots. \u201cA day to fight,\u201d Phil Mickelson said. \u201cGuessing what the wind would do to your ball was the game within the game all day. \u201d It was also a day that started with the world\u2019s hottest golfer, Dustin Johnson, withdrawing from the tournament just minutes before he was to step onto the first tee because of a back injury sustained falling on a staircase Wednesday night. At roughly the same time that Johnson was exiting, Jordan Spieth, who blew his chance at winning last year\u2019s Masters with a stunning   7 on the 12th hole, made an equally startling quadruple bogey on No. 15. It will probably not be remembered as vividly as the 2016 catastrophe, but it was just as spectacular  \u2014   an unfathomable 9. The first round was, however, still a day of golf, which is to say it was mystifying and indecipherable. As most of the field stumbled around the grounds with   faces and expressions of bewilderment, one player waltzed across the   layout without distress or strain. Charley Hoffman shot a    65 to take the   lead by four strokes. Given the conditions, it may have been one of the better opening rounds ever at the Masters. Hoffman had nine birdies  \u2014   including 2s on the course\u2019s four par 3s  \u2014   and two bogeys. \u201cOn a day like today, like everyone else I was just trying to make par and not shoot myself out of the tournament,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cBut I started getting some shots close to the hole, and then I couldn\u2019t remember missing a putt. \u201d Hoffman\u2019s closest pursuer was William McGirt, who shot 69. Lee Westwood, a frequent Masters contender but never a major winner, was a stroke behind McGirt with a    70. A gaggle of golfers finished at one under par, including three major championship winners: Justin Rose, Jason Dufner and Mickelson. \u201cIt was a day when experience mattered,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cThe wind was going to magnify your misses, and the guys who miss in the wrong spots will make big numbers. \u201cI love these conditions. Certainly challenging, but that\u2019s O. K. \u201d Also at one under par was Sergio Garc\u00eda, who has long been tormented at Augusta National, and the precocious    Matthew Fitzpatrick, playing in just his third Masters. Hoffman, playing in his fourth Masters, did not have an auspicious start to his round: He needed three putts on the third and fifth holes. But, having played well here before, he remained patient. \u201cI step on this property, and it just feels special,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cOff the tee, it just suits my eye. And I\u2019ve been working hard on my putting. I\u2019ve learned here that you have to be aggressive on your putts. You can\u2019t be afraid to run the ball 3 feet past. \u201d And Hoffman, a Texan, is used to playing in blustery conditions. At the 2015 Masters, he was in second place after the second round and finished tied for ninth as Spieth claimed the championship. Asked Thursday what lesson he took from contending two years ago, Hoffman said: \u201cI learned that I hit it as good as Jordan. He just made more putts. So the lesson was to make more putts in the Masters. \u201d Hoffman was eight under par over his final 13 holes. That kind of performance mocked what was going on most of the day, as some of the best golfers in the world were humbled. The former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen shot a 77, as did the 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson and last year\u2019s British Open winner, Henrik Stenson. Adam Scott, Webb Simpson and Bernhard Langer, each a major champion, joined Spieth at three over par. Spieth\u2019s score was respectable given his trouble on the 15th, a debacle that included a pitch shot into the pond fronting the green, and three putts. Dustin Johnson, who had won his last three tournaments, warmed up for his afternoon tee time but ultimately decided he could not play because he could not follow through on his swings  \u2014   even at 80 percent of normal effort. Johnson fell Wednesday while walking down a   staircase at his rented home in the Augusta area. With the opening round completed, the Masters field seemed eager to flee the vicinity. As the sun set, sand was still being blown from the bunkers onto other parts of the property. And not a single golfer was hitting golf balls on the practice range. They had had enough. When McGirt\u2019s round was complete  \u2014   and his was a fruitful   round  \u2014   he was asked where on the golf course the gusts had been at their worst. He answered, \u201cFrom holes 1 to 18. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563835.3743236}
