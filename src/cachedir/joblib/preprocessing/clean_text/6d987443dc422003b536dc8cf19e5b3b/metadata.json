Recent scientific studies have indicated that the human body\u2019s reaction to stress could be one of the main causes of many life-threatening diseases, including heart disease and cancer. When we feel that we are in danger, a stress response surges through us and our bodies under-go an explosion of stress hormones that, over-time, are hazardous to our health. Ways Stress Negatively Affects Your Health 1. Increased Heart Rate When we enter into the fight or flight mode, the heart-rate naturally speeds up. While this may be a great thing if we need to run quickly, overtime this can significantly tire out the heart and lead to cardiovascular diseases, increased cholesterol and even excess belly fat . 2. Digestion Slows When we go into a state of stress, the energy needed for digestive processes is immediately sent to external areas of the body, such as the head, heart and limbs. This leads to a whole host of chronic stress-related digestive conditions. Chronic constipation and irritable bowel conditions are directly related, in many cases, to chronic stress. In fact, estimates show that as many as 20 percent of Americans experience chronic constipation and symptoms of IBS. Changes in appetite are also a stress-related condition. When we experience mental and emotional stress, we often reach for comfort foods to give us the false sensation of being calm. Similarly, some people react in the opposite way, losing their appetites when stress or anxiety levels are high. 3. High Blood Pressure Problems Studies show that when we are under stress, blood flow to the brain and muscles increase up to 400 percent. While this may be useful if we are planning on leaping into a tree, over time, chronic stress creates the scene for high blood pressure conditions or even a stroke. 4. Weight Gain Evidence shows that increased cortisol hormone levels caused by prolonged stress can lead to overall weight gain . 5. General Muscle Tension and Chronic Fatigue Muscles become tight when we are stressed. Because the muscles are constantly in a \u201cgripping\u201d state, they later become over-worked and leave us with a general sensation of body fatigue. Studies show that generalized back pain may also be a response to chronic stress-related muscle gripping along the spine. 6. Insomnia and Other Sleep-Conditions When the mind is continually spinning and stressing on the problems of life, it can be hard to unwind when the day is over. Insomnia is a sleep condition that is directly related to mental stress. 7. Reduced Happiness and Quality of Life Stress causes negative mental and emotional reactions. When we are stressed, it can be difficult for us to establish healthy social relationships, as we are constantly working to preserve personal stasis. 8. Immune Conditions Stress negatively effects the blood cells that aid in your body\u2019s ability to ward off infections, leading to greater likelihood of developing colds, flu and degenerative disorders. 9. Other Conditions Many modern studies are now linking the experience of chronic stress with a multitude of conditions. In fact, estimates show that up to two-thirds of all medical visits are for stress-induced conditions. Other stress-related conditions include depression, anxiety, migraine headaches, lack of sexual desire, chronic fatigue syndrome, IBS, immune disorders, memory loss, reproductive disorders, cold and flu conditions , skin imbalances such as acne, stunted growth and hair loss. On a Personal Note We all get stressed out at some point. It\u2019s inevitable and part of life. However, there are a few things you can do to help relieve stress, as well as stop it from coming in the first place.
