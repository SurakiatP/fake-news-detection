She arrived in Greece in February after fleeing Syria with her family and crossing from Turkey in a rickety boat. Since then, she has been living in a shabby   camp, her future uncertain, her present reduced to the bare necessities. Not long ago, the Greek government decided to give her a shot at something closer to a normal life: Along with 22, 000 other refugee children, she would be allowed to attend public school starting in October. But as with many aspects of Europe\u2019s effort to cope with the huge numbers of migrants who have come to its shores, the plan quickly ran into intense opposition, in this case from parents in a number of communities near camps in northern Greece. The refugee children, the parents said, might have contagious diseases. Cultural differences, they said, might disrupt learning. Last week, an association representing the parents of schoolchildren in the small town of Filippiada in western Greece sent a letter to local officials and the Education Ministry, saying \u201cexplicitly and categorically that we will not accept, under any circumstance and without any compromise, that the children of   irregular immigrants\u201d attend local schools, referring to migrants entering the country illegally. \u201cThey come from another continent with completely different diseases and health conditions,\u201d the letter said, adding that the refugees have a \u201cdifferent outlook regarding the role of the family, of women, of religion. \u201d Their presence would \u201calter the Greek character of the schools,\u201d the letter said, adding, \u201cWe will not allow religious fanaticism. \u201d Earlier in September, the parents\u2019 association of two schools in the town of Oraiokastro in northern Greece threatened to occupy the school grounds in protest if refugees from a nearby   facility were allowed to join classes. A few days earlier, the local mayor had called on residents to take the law into their own hands amid rumors that some refugees were moving into houses in the area. The parents\u2019 announcements and a video of the mayor\u2019s suggestion that residents \u201cintervene\u201d caused a public outcry and a storm of angry reactions on social media. They also prompted a Greek prosecutor to investigate whether the parents\u2019 groups or the local mayor should be charged with racist offenses. Since then, both the parents\u2019 groups and the mayor have toned down their responses, saying their only concern is the possible health implication if the refugee children are not vaccinated. The mayor, Asterios Gavotsis, said his comments in the videotaped meeting were \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d and that he was \u201cnot inciting anyone to commit illegal acts. \u201d Outside one of the schools, Haralambos Magoulianos, a    retiree waiting to collect his two granddaughters, said he opposed admitting the refugee children. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens if we have an epidemic? I don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he added, saying that youths from the nearby refugee camp \u201csteal bicycles and jump into our backyards. \u201d Other parents in the area have been more welcoming. The principal of the school in Filippiada and some parents there said the letter sent by the parents in that area did not reflect their views. In Oraiokastro, Alexandra Hapsi, 41, has two children in school. She said she had cooked food and donated clothes for refugees living at the sprawling camp at Idomeni, farther north, which was shut this year. \u201cIn Europe, no one is taking in refugees, and they call us racist,\u201d she said, adding that she also wanted reassurances that the refugees attending local schools had been vaccinated. Asterios Batos, whose children attend the same school as Ms. Hapsi\u2019s, leads the group representing the parents\u2019 associations of all 41 schools in the broader region. \u201cThis image of a racist municipality is unfair,\u201d he said, referring to the broader region. \u201cWe\u2019re not racists. We\u2019re concerned about whether all the right precautions have been taken. \u201d The plan calls for the migrant children to attend school in the afternoons. Initially, they would be kept in classes separate from Greek children, but they would eventually be merged into the general student population. In comments to Greek television last week, the education minister, Nikos Filis, said the program for the induction of refugees into schools included vaccinations. The lessons will be in Greek, math and English, or another language, depending on where the refugees plan to travel on to. The government has yet to specify which schools will be part of the program, stoking frustration among some parents and local officials. \u201cDoes a neighborhood or a school have the right to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want foreigners here?\u2019 No, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Filis said. The mayor of Oraiokastro, Mr. Gavotsis, said that he was not opposed to refugees\u2019 being educated, but that classes should be held for a year in other venues, such as disused factories, before the children attend local schools. He said the high proportion of refugees in Oraiokastro, which has a population of 30, 000, was testing tolerance. \u201cWe have 10 percent of all Greece\u2019s refugees here,\u201d he said, referring to some 6, 000 migrants at three nearby camps. There are just over 60, 000 refugees in camps across Greece. Tensions often boil over among frustrated migrants, some of whom have been waiting for months for the outcome of their asylum applications, and many local residents are fed up, holding regular protests. The turmoil has been exploited by members of   groups who have infiltrated some of the protests. \u201cWe just want a fair distribution,\u201d Mr. Gavotsis said. \u201cIf that makes us racist, what can I say?\u201d Katerina Karanikolaou, who attended the meeting where Mr. Gavotsis suggested that local residents \u201cintervene\u201d to stop the education plan, was the only one of 72 parents to vote against a motion to occupy one of the schools in protest. She said the health concerns were a smoke screen. \u201cThe xenophobia started with Idomeni in February, and it\u2019s taken root since,\u201d she said, adding that residents feared \u201ctheir town will be downgraded. \u201d Last Monday evening, Ms. Karanikolaou and her four children joined an antiracism rally, marching from the mayor\u2019s office through the pristine streets of Oraiokastro, which means \u201cbeautiful castle. \u201d It was named by Greek refugees who settled there from 1924 to 1930 after a castle that used to sit on the coast of the Black Sea. \u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Ms. Karanikolaou said. \u201cOur ancestors were refugees. \u201d Around a mile away, in a huge disused tobacco factory, Mariya, the    girl from Syria, lives with her parents and seven siblings in a tent, one of hundreds sheltering some 1, 300 refugees. The camp is filthy  \u2014   state health officials have called for its closure  \u2014   but aid organizations run an efficient clinic, vaccinating children against mumps, measles, rubella and hepatitis. Stirring chunks of stale bread into a pan with browning onions for the family\u2019s evening meal, Mariya\u2019s mother, Jihan Sheikh Mohammed, 33, said she would prefer that her daughter attend a local school rather than receive the makeshift lessons given on site by humanitarian workers. But her father, Loqman Abdlkarim, 42, is keen to move on, as the family\u2019s next asylum interview is not until April and he has relatives waiting for him in Germany. \u201cI will wait another 20 days,\u201d he said. \u201cIf nothing happens, then we\u2019ll go back to Turkey. Even Syria is better than this,\u201d he said, adding that drug dealing and sexual abuse were rife in the camp. Mariya, a bright, friendly girl, wants to stay. She said she would like to be a lawyer eventually. \u201cHelping people,\u201d she said. Oblivious to residents\u2019 objections in the nearby town, she is eager to go to a real school, but is nervous about fitting in. Frowning pensively, she pointed to her grubby purple tracksuit and bare feet. \u201cWill they let me go like this?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563714.8439877}
