Yes, but that\u2019s not entirely the explanation, either. In a summer when studios suffered more misfires than ever, many of them supersized, Hollywood is scratching for answers, and some longtime movie executives are pointing toward a nuanced shift in consumer behavior. For the first time since moviegoing became a staple of American life, an underappreciated revenue engine  \u2014   ticket buyers who still trek to theaters more for the experience than for the movie itself  \u2014   may finally be conking out. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where, if people don\u2019t get excited about a specific movie and plan in advance to go to it, you may end up with literally no one,\u201d said Adam Fogelson, the former chairman of Universal Pictures who now runs STX Entertainment\u2019s film unit. When movies do not seem worth the hassle, and there seem to be many more of those, there is less of a cushion for studios. Is it because the number of people just wandering in is dwindling? Theater owners and some analysts dismiss that idea, saying studios are refusing to look inward for explanations for a cavalcade of summer disappointments, including \u201cThe BFG,\u201d \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,\u201d \u201cThe Nice Guys,\u201d \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cThe Legend of Tarzan,\u201d \u201cIndependence Day: Resurgence,\u201d \u201cNeighbors 2: Sorority Rising,\u201d \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass,\u201d \u201cWarcraft,\u201d \u201cIce Age: Collision Course,\u201d \u201cHands of Stone,\u201d \u201cStar Trek: Beyond\u201d and \u201cNow You See Me 2. \u201d \u201c \u201d cost    and Paramount Pictures at least $150 million to make and market, but was savaged by critics and took in only $11. 2 million during its first weekend in theaters. That\u2019s the Hollywood equivalent of \u201cliterally no one. \u201d (An art house example: Despite starring Matthew McConaughey and Naomi Watts, \u201cThe Sea of Trees\u201d last month collected a total of $2, 894 over its first two weeks in two theaters.) Sequelitis and an overload of event movies have been blamed for much of the carnage. But sequels have sputtered before. The collapse of \u201cHappy Feet Two\u201d and the \u201cChronicles of Narnia\u201d series led to similar anxiety a few years ago. \u201cWe think the issue is less that audiences are tired of sequels, and more that there are now so many sequels that they are cannibalizing each other,\u201d Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a report on Thursday. Nor is it just that the summer offerings were particularly awful. \u201cThe data suggests differently,\u201d Mr. Cruetz wrote, noting that the summer\u2019s 29 widely released movies had an average score of 57. 7 percent positive on the   site Rotten Tomatoes, the highest in 16 years. The lack of clear answers has led to    \u2014   \u201cCould This Be the Year Movies Stopped Mattering?\u201d asked a Wired headline last month  \u2014   and studio theorizing about    factors, like a decline in patrons who decide what film to see while standing in line. Most people would never consider arriving at a theater without a specific movie in mind. Astoundingly, though, more than a quarter of all ticket buyers still decide what film to see only after showing up, according to PostTrak, an audience polling service owned by comScore. Theaters offer supporting anecdotal evidence. \u201cOur members say the most common questions their ticket sellers get are \u2018What\u2019s good?\u2019 and \u2018What\u2019s playing next? \u2019\u201d said Patrick Corcoran, vice president of the National Association of Theater Owners. Still, while data is scarce, PostTrak does show an erosion. In summer 2014, about 32 percent of people made their decision while in line at a theater. In 2015, the number was about 28 percent. PostTrak discontinued research on this audience segment in March, leaving studios to guess at what happened over the 2016 summer season, which started on May 6 and ends on Monday. If the    crowd is dwindling, the reasons include the comparative ease of other forms of entertainment (HBO Go, Netflix) the increasing cost of moviegoing (now $17. 25 per adult at the ArcLight chain\u2019s Hollywood location, before   upcharges) and the movie business itself, which has aggressively pushed one kind of event movie (lumbering,    sequels) at the expense of variety. The increasing popularity of online ticketing and reserved seating may also be playing a role. At Fandango, \u201cthere has been a shift from   purchase to advanced purchase,\u201d according to Harry Medved, a company spokesman. Last week, AMC Entertainment, the No. 1 theater chain in North America, said that all nine of its locations in New York City would soon offer reserved seating. \u201cIn the olden, olden days, people went to see whatever was playing, but people today, flooded with niche entertainment programming, don\u2019t want to spend money on a movie they are only   in seeing,\u201d said the film historian Jeanine Basinger, whose books include \u201cThe Star Machine. \u201d When hauling the family to the theater seems worth it, the upside can still be enormous, Ms. Basinger noted. \u201cFinding Dory\u201d and \u201cCaptain America: Civil War,\u201d both from Disney, were the top draws of the summer, collecting a combined $891 million at North American theaters, according to comScore. Third place went to Universal\u2019s \u201cSecret Life of Pets,\u201d which took in $360 million a sequel is already in the works. On a smaller scale, STX Entertainment hit the jackpot with its modestly budgeted \u201cBad Moms,\u201d which passed $100 million over the weekend, and Sony similarly succeeded with \u201cSausage Party,\u201d which has taken in about $90 million. Warner Bros. powered \u201cLights Out,\u201d a horror movie made for $5 million, to $66 million in ticket sales. Over all, the handful of blockbuster hits made up for the misses  \u2014   at least for theater owners, who will collect roughly $4. 49 billion at the summer box office, on par with 2015, according to comScore. (Last summer was one week longer.) Attendance is expected to total 513 million, a 3. 5 percent decline. For the year, theaters have generated about $8. 11 billion in ticket revenue, a 5 percent increase attendance is up about 1. 2 percent. But the misfires have added up for studios, most of which have been spending more on individual films as they search for global hits. Warner Bros. Sony, Universal, 20th Century Fox and Paramount all had diminished or nonexistent profits in the most recent quarter. Disney was the exception, with a huge $766 million in profit, a 62 percent increase from the same quarter a year earlier. But even Disney has struggled recently. Its last three   releases have been duds: \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass,\u201d \u201cThe BFG\u201d and \u201cPete\u2019s Dragon. \u201d And, over the Labor Day weekend, a fourth, \u201cThe Light Between Oceans\u201d is expected to sell a disappointing $6. 3 million. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see a lot of middle ground this season,\u201d Dave Hollis, Disney\u2019s executive vice president for theatrical distribution, said on Sunday. \u201cThere are probably multiple reasons why, starting with the fact that people are making their selections much more carefully. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562889.8730626}
