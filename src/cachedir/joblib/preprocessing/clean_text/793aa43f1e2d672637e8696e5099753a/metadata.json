The request by antidoping officials was extraordinary, if not unprecedented, in the history of the Olympics. President Vladimir V. Putin responded defiantly as the possibility emerged that the Russian flag would not appear at the opening ceremony on Aug. 5 in Rio de Janeiro. While announcing that the Russian sports officials named in the report would be \u201ctemporarily suspended,\u201d Mr. Putin on Monday asked for \u201cfuller, more objective information that is based on facts. \u201d \u201cToday we see a dangerous relapse of politics intruding into sports,\u201d he said in a statement. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, Russia\u2019s former antidoping lab director, told The New York Times in May that he covered up the use of   drugs by Russian Olympians at the Sochi Games, and that he did so under orders from the government and with the aid of Russia\u2019s intelligence service. In a report of nearly 100 pages, Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer retained by the World   Agency to investigate Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s claims, presented proof that a   doping program was executed during the Sochi Olympics, and well before and afterward. With evidence dating to 2011, the report said athletes were given cocktails of   drugs, and incriminating urine samples were routinely covered up. Beyond interviews, the report was informed by forensic evidence, metadata and emails retrieved from computer hard drives. The investigative team gained access to 95 doping samples of Russian athletes from Sochi that had been stored in Switzerland 11 were chosen at random for analysis. All of them showed signs of tampering, the report said, including scratches on the inside of the bottle caps and abnormal levels of table salt in urine, which Dr. Rodchenkov said he added to make certain recorded chemistry measurements of the tainted and clean samples matched. Investigators confirmed that a man identified as a member of Russia\u2019s intelligence service  \u2014   Evgeny Blokhin, with whom Dr. Rodchenkov conducted the covert overnight   operation in a storage closet at Sochi  \u2014   had a security badge to access the Sochi lab. That security clearance identified him as a sewage and pipes engineer, the inquiry found. The International Olympic Committee, which has the sole authority to ban an entire national delegation, called the actions outlined in the report a \u201cshocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport,\u201d pledging to pursue \u201cthe toughest possible sanctions available against any individual or organization implicated. \u201d Top Olympic executives were next due to meet in Rio, two days before the Olympics begin on Aug. 5, but the I. O. C. said Monday that it had scheduled a meeting for Tuesday to discuss \u201cprovisional measures and sanctions. \u201d Officials are now under intense pressure from antidoping officials and athletes to bring stiff sanctions against Russia, less than three weeks before the Games begin. Discussing his findings in an interview in a Toronto hotel ballroom, Mr. McLaren said that the conclusions of his   inquiry met   standards. He confirmed that his team had communicated with the United States Department of Justice, which in May opened its own inquiry into Russian doping. Mr. McLaren said his inquiry had established \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that Russia\u2019s ministry of sport, its antidoping organization and the country\u2019s federal security service were involved in an elaborate cheating scheme that stretched far beyond what had been alleged. \u201cThe surprise result of the Sochi investigation was the revelation of the extent of State oversight and directed control of the Moscow laboratory in processing, and covering up urine samples of Russian athletes from virtually all sports before and after the Sochi Games,\u201d Mr. McLaren wrote in the report. The evidence showed that the subversion of doping controls had occurred in 30 sports, including 20 Olympic summer sports and Paralympic sports. Craig Reedie, the president of the global antidoping organization that commissioned the report, was not present at the Toronto announcement, but in a statement he expressed concern that, in addition to the Sochi Games, there was a \u201cserious manipulation of the doping control process\u201d at the 2013 track and field world championships in Moscow and the 2013 World University Games in Kazan, with additional measures to circumvent doping controls at the 2012 London Games. Dr. Rodchenkov said he created a mixture of steroids and liquor  \u2014   known as \u201cthe Duchess\u201d cocktail among Russian sports officials, according to the report  \u2014   that was provided to athletes ahead of competition. That combination promoted speedy absorption of the drugs, to minimize the period of time during which they could be detected. \u201cIn the face of such evidence of   subversion of antidoping processes,\u201d Mr. Reedie said on Monday, \u201cWADA insists upon imposition of the most serious consequences to protect clean athletes from the scourge of doping in sport. \u201d Mr. Reedie, who is also an executive board member of the Olympic organization, noted that the Russian Olympic Committee was not untainted by the findings, and that cheating had extended to \u201call sport disciplines whose urine samples were being analyzed by the Moscow lab. \u201d Some sports officials spoke up in defense of Russia on Monday, articulating the hope that \u201call countries and athletes will be present\u201d at the Games, as Brazilian sports minister Leonardo Picciani said. The International Olympic Committee has defended the integrity of the Russian Olympic Committee in recent weeks. But some of the key actors in the government scheme who were named in the report also had Olympic committee roles. Russian officials emphatically dismissed Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s claims after they were published in May. Still, Russia\u2019s track and field team was banned last month from competing at the Games by the International Association of Athletics Federations, the sport\u2019s governing body, after Mr. McLaren had privately given a preliminary report on his investigation. Russia is contesting the track and field ban with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland, and the hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday. \u201cThis is not just about what we in North America call track and field and what others in the world call athletics,\u201d Mr. McLaren said, confirming Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s claims that cheating pervaded Russian sport  \u2014   affecting results at both the Winter and Summer Olympics and leaving   who have finished behind Russian athletes with questions. Mr. McLaren said in the report that he had not had enough time to identify athletes who might have benefited from manipulated test results. The antidoping agency said it was interested in commissioning further investigation, provided the funding was available. The report identified several Russian officials who had engaged in sophisticated planning dating back years. Lead among them was Yuri Nagornykh, Russia\u2019s deputy minister of sport and a Russian Olympic Committee executive, who had denied the accusations after The Times\u2019s report last spring. Mr. McLaren\u2019s report also named Irina Rodionova, the deputy director of the center of sports preparation of national teams of Russia, confirming that Ms. Rodionova provided Dr. Rodchenkov with information on which anonymous, coded urine samples belonged to each athlete, and thus informing whose urine he swapped into each bottle. The antidoping adviser to Russia\u2019s sports minister, Natalia Zhelanova, was also identified as a key liaison in the scheme \u201cas early as 2012,\u201d having sent emails about covering up drug positives from her government account, the inquiry found. Asked about the allegations last week in Moscow, Ms. Zhelanova denied wrongdoing. But about Ms. Rodionova\u2019s involvement, she said: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d while insisting that the work of Ms. Rodionova was independent of the sports ministry. She gestured toward the offices of Ms. Rodionova, steps from the sports ministry\u2019s palatial yellow headquarters and sharing a courtyard where cars are parked. After hearing Mr. McLaren\u2019s remarks on Monday, Paul Melia, Canada\u2019s top antidoping officer, said the only appropriate response was to keep the Russian flag from flying in Rio. \u201cI was anticipating the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cYet when I listen to the evidence, I\u2019m shocked and devastated. \u201d Nearing the end of a day filled with   reaction to his report, Mr. McLaren said he been skeptical of the allegations two months earlier. \u201cSome of it was described in a way I thought was fanciful and couldn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said, referring to the hole in the wall through which Dr. Rodchenkov said urine bottles had been passed starting around midnight each night. \u201cNow I know it did happen. \u201d Dr. Rodchenkov remains in the United States but has declined interview requests as government investigations into Russian doping continue. Bryan Fogel, a filmmaker who has been collaborating with Dr. Rodchenkov on a documentary about doping and who facilitated his travel from Moscow to Los Angeles last fall, said he felt vindicated. \u201cHe knows he was telling the truth, so the report\u2019s conclusions were not a surprise,\u201d Mr. Fogel said. \u201cThe relevant authorities now have all of his evidence. \u201d Ahead of Rio, the impact of that evidence is continuing. \u201cThe Olympic brand is under intense scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Melia said. \u201cThis is a seminal time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628445.9192317}
