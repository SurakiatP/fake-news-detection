[\u201cThat\u2019s What Makes Us Great\u201d is a joint effort between The Boss and frequent collaborator Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers.  \u201cDon\u2019t tell me a   And sell it as a   I\u2019ve been down that road   And I ain\u2019t going back,\u201d Springsteen sings on the track, which was released Wednesday morning on Grushecky\u2019s website. \u201cDon\u2019t you brag to   That you never read a   I never put my   In a con man and his crooks,\u201d the song continues. Grushecky  \u2014   whose 1995 album American Babylon was produced by Springsteen  \u2014   told the Pittsburgh   that he\u2019d written the song before the Boss got involved. Springsteen reportedly sent his part to the   musician over the Internet. \u201cI had this song, and Bruce and I had been talking. I sent it to him and he liked it,\u201d Grushecky told the paper. \u201cI said, \u2018What do you think about singing on it?\u2019 He gave it the Bruce treatment. \u201d Springsteen was vocal supporter of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and a fierce critic of Trump during the 2016 campaign. In September, the    E Street Band leader called Trump a \u201cmoron\u201d in an interview with Rolling Stone. \u201cThe republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout overstating it, it\u2019s a tragedy for our democracy. When you start talking about elections being rigged, you\u2019re pushing people beyond democratic governance. And it\u2019s a very, very dangerous thing to do. \u201d On the eve of the election, Springsteen performed at a   campaign rally for Clinton in Philadelphia, where he predicted Trump and his campaign were \u201cgoing down. \u201d \u201cLet\u2019s all do our part so that we can look back on 2016 and say, \u2018We stood with Hillary Clinton on the right side of history,\u2019\u201d he said then.
