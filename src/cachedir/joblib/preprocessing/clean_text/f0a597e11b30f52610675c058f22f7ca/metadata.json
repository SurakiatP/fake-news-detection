They are variously referred to as Visitors, Others, Star People, Et\u2019s, etc\u2026They are visiting Earth now; this is not a matter of conjecture or wistful thinking.\u201d \u2013 Theodor C. Loder III, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences, University of New Hampshire. \\nWe cannot address the UFO phenomena without mentioning Dr. Edgar Mitchel, one of the best-known Apollo astronauts and the sixth man to walk on the moon; a retired Captain in the US Navy, aeronautical engineer and founder of the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) who had much to say about Alien life: \u201cI happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real\u2026Yes, there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. We are not alone in the universe; they have been coming here for a long time.\u201d \\nFranklin Story Musgrave, an American Physician, retired NASA astronaut who worked on the design and development of the Skylab Program and the only astronaut to have flown missions on all five Space Shuttles had very interesting things to say about life elsewhere in the cosmos: \u201cStatistically it\u2019s a certainty there are hugely advanced civilizations, intelligence, life forms out there. I believe they\u2019re so advanced that they\u2019re even doing interstellar travel. I believe it\u2019s possible that they even came here. It\u2019s logical to presume the universe must have other life in it and by virtue of association that we could be visited at some point.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628549.1530652}
