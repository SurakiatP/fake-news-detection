However, family members dispute the police narrative. \\nMichael Beal, Joshua Beal\u2019s brother, was charged with aggravated battery to a police officer, resisting arrest and attempting to disarm a police officer, a Cook County State\u2019s Attorney spokesperson said Monday. He is scheduled to appear in court at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday. \\nOn Sunday, Mount Greenwood residents squared off against activists demonstrating against the shooting. The clash between Black Lives Matters and Blue Lives Matters groups became tense at times as they exchanged chants such as \u201cKKK\u201d on one side and \u201cCPD\u201d on the other side. \\n{snip} \\nAccording to police, the shooting occurred after a vehicle leaving funeral services at a nearby cemetery stopped in traffic in front of a Chicago fire house near West 111th Street and South Troy Street. An off-duty firefighter told the driver that they were illegally blocking the fire lane. The occupants exited the vehicle and a verbal/physical altercation ensured, police said. An off-duty Chicago police officer was inside a nearby business and assisted the firefighter. \\nA Chicago police sergeant driving to work stopped when he observed a man with a firearm in his hands. After the man \u201cfailed to drop his weapon, shots were fired striking the individual multiple times,\u201d police said. \\n{snip} \\nAccording to family, an off-duty officer in an unmarked vehicle cut off one of the vehicles in the funeral procession. The family members and officer got out of their vehicles. After a verbal exchange, gunfire erupted but Beal\u2019s family said that he did not provoke the officer, and merely disclosing that he had a concealed weapon permit. \\n{snip} \\nVideo circulated online on Sunday that claimed to show Beal holding a gun. \\n\u201cThe problem is everybody is making their assumptions based on the little stuff they see, the picture, the video. No one knows what happened,\u201d activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said. \\nThe video appears to capture the tense moments before the shooting, showing at least two people with their guns out.
