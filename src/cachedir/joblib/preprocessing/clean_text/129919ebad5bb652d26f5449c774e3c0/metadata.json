Rice, the former national security adviser, may have committed a crime by seeking to learn the identities of Trump associates swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by United States spy agencies, repeating an assertion his allies in the news media have been making since last week. Mr. Trump gave no evidence to support his claim, and current and former intelligence officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have said they do not believe Ms. Rice\u2019s actions were unusual or unlawful. The president repeatedly rebuffed attempts by two New York Times reporters to learn more about what led him to the conclusion, saying he would talk more about it \u201cat the right time. \u201d The allegation by a sitting president was a remarkable escalation  \u2014   and, his critics say, the latest effort to change the story at a time when his nascent administration has been consumed by questions about any role his associates may have played in a Russian campaign to disrupt last year\u2019s presidential election. Since March 4, when Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that President Barack Obama had \u201cwiretapped\u201d him at Trump Tower during the campaign, the president and his allies have repeatedly sought evidence trying to corroborate that claim, despite flat denials from James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. and other senior intelligence officials. Wednesday\u2019s interview revealed how Mr. Trump seizes on claims made by the conservative news media, from fringe outlets to Fox News, and gives them a presidential stamp of approval and also increases their reach. Last week, some Republican television commentators asserted that Ms. Rice had improperly leaked the names of Trump associates picked up in surveillance of foreign officials. On Sunday, a conservative writer and conspiracy theorist reported, without identifying his sources, that Ms. Rice had been the one to seek identities of the Trump associates. Other conservative outlets picked up the report, and the Drudge Report website, which has been supportive of Mr. Trump, featured the story prominently. White House officials then accused mainstream news outlets of not giving the story proper coverage. The interview with The Times was supposed to be focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for   spending on the nation\u2019s infrastructure. But moments after it began, the president began talking about Ms. Rice. \u201cI think the Susan Rice thing is a massive story. I think it\u2019s a massive, massive story. All over the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger story than you know,\u201d the president added cryptically, also saying that new information would emerge \u201cin terms of what other people have done also. \u201d \u201cThe Russia story is a total hoax. There has been absolutely nothing coming out of that,\u201d he said. Turning the subject to Ms. Rice, the president said: \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is terrible. I\u2019ve never seen people so indignant, including many Democrats who are friends of mine. \u201d Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Rice said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to dignify the president\u2019s ludicrous charge with a comment. \u201d In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, Ms. Rice said she had done nothing wrong. \u201cThe allegation is that somehow the Obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes,\u201d Ms. Rice said. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely false. \u201d Normally, when Americans are swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by intelligence agencies, their identities are supposed to be obscured. But they can be revealed  \u2014   or \u201cunmasked\u201d  \u2014   for national security reasons, and intelligence officials say it is a regular occurrence and completely legal for a national security adviser to request the identities of Americans who are mentioned in intelligence reports. Intelligence officials said any requests that Ms. Rice made would have had to be granted by the intelligence agency that produced the report. In most cases, that would likely have been the National Security Agency, which is responsible for electronic surveillance of foreign officials. \u201cRequests to learn the identity of a U. S. person were not routine, but also not uncommon,\u201d said Stephen Slick, a retired C. I. A. official who served as the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. Requesting that a name be revealed so that officials could \u201cmake sense of an intelligence report was a normal part of the daily intelligence rhythm at the White House, State Department, Defense Department and other national security agencies,\u201d added Mr. Slick, who is now the director of the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin. It could be a crime if Ms. Rice leaked the name of any American wrapped up in the surveillance net, but she flatly denied doing so in her MSNBC interview. \u201cI leaked nothing to nobody, and never have and never would,\u201d Ms. Rice said. The broader issue of how intelligence collected by the national security apparatus is disseminated and used has long been an animating issue for civil libertarians, a point that Mr. Trump made in the interview. Revelations about American programs for intercepting and mining private data made by Edward J. Snowden, a government contractor, proved deeply embarrassing for the Obama administration in 2013. Mr. Trump declined to say whether he would be willing to declassify some of the information that has been at issue. He also did not explain what he believed was unlawful in his estimation. It is not the first time Mr. Trump has made a provocative allegation without providing supporting evidence. One of the most notorious instances of this was his yearslong claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Like his statements about Mr. Obama  \u2014   which he walked away from late in the 2016 presidential campaign  \u2014   Mr. Trump\u2019s claims about Ms. Rice have taken hold in the conservative news media, where she has been a target ever since her press appearances after the terrorist attack on a diplomatic outpost in Libya in September 2012. Mr. Trump\u2019s March 4 Twitter message came after reports in conservative news outlets  \u2014   including Breitbart, the website once run by the president\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  \u2014   claiming that there had been surveillance of some kind against Mr. Trump when he was a candidate. Mr. Trump was widely criticized for the intemperate post, and he began to ask his advisers about how he might be able to investigate the issue. Weeks later, Representative Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters that he had learned of new information that Trump associates may have been surveilled in some way. He rushed to the White House to brief the president, even though it was later revealed that the information had come from White House officials. Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, cast Mr. Trump\u2019s comments as part of a broader effort by the president to distract from the investigations into Russia\u2019s interference in the election. The committee is running one of the investigations. \u201cHe began by accusing President Obama of a crime without any evidence,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cHe\u2019s now moved on to accusing Susan Rice of a crime without any evidence, and this is sadly how this president operates. \u201d It \u201cwould be a terrible way to do business,\u201d Mr. Schiff added. \u201cIt\u2019s a worse way to run a country. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561725.6906238}
