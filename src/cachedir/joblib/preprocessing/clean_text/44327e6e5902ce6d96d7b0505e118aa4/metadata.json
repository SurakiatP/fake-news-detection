FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \\n\u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \\n\u201c In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation ,\u201d Director James Comey said in a letter to committee chairmen in Congress. \u201c I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information. \u201d \\nEndless scandals \\nComey said he can\u2019t say how long the new investigation will take \u2013 raising the possibility that Clinton could go into Election Day on Nov. 9 with the new probe unresolved and still hanging over her campaign. \\nThe Dow Jones plunged 150 points as news of the investigation broke. Bloomberg reported , \u201c U.S. stocks erased gains as markets again showed themselves sensitive to perceptions about Clinton\u2019s prospects. The Mexican peso dropped, a reflection of Trump\u2019s plan to renegotiate trade pacts with the country and reduce immigration. \u201c \\nImpeachment \\nThere was also turmoil in betting markets, as the odds on a Trump presidency rose by double digits. Odds on a President Hillary Clinton being impeached in her first term also skyrocketed, as the Democratic nominee faces up to a future engulfed by endless scandal. On Thursday Clinton warned her supporters the next 11 days will be rocky \u2013 but the bumpy ride will continue long after the election. \\nThough Hillary remains favorite with betting markets, the pattern is remarkably similar to odds for Brexit in the weeks before the vote. The Remain camp was considered a certainty until weeks before the referendum, with a sharp dive in the last week. Analysts believe a repeat of the British anti-establishment vote is on the cards. \\nOne of Hillary Clinton\u2019s most vocal critics on the business side is finance commentator and markets expert Jim Rickards. Jim is on a world tour promoting his book, \u2018The Road to Ruin \u2013 The Global Elites\u2019 Secret Plan for the Next Financial Crisis\u2019 and gave an interesting interview on ABC Australia. \\nRickards says that the polls are misleading and Trump \u201c will probably win \u201d and, if he does stock markets, so heavily invested in a Clinton win will crash 10% and gold will rise $100 over night. \\n\u201cBigger than Watergate\u201d \\nTrump celebrated the FBI\u2019s decision at a Friday afternoon rally in New Hampshire. \\n\u201c This is bigger than Watergate ,\u201d Trump told the crowd, which began chanting \u201c lock her up \u201d after he told them about the probe. \\n\u201c I have great respect that the FBI and Department of Justice have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made ,\u201d Trump said. \u201c This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood .\u201d \\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said in a statement that \u201c This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628472.5694048}
