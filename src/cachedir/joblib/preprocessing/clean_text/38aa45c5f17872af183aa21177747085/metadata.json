The white working class turned against the Democrat party in a historic fashion during this election. The numbers are stunning, even to someone as stunning as me,\u201d MILO proclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m not a dataporn kind of faggot like those   losers at the Guardian and the spectacularly dreadful FiveThirtyEight, but I have to share a few of the key stats from Pew Research with you. \u201d \u201c  whites voted for Donald Trump by a 4% margin. This is similar to how they voted for Mitt Romney,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat is a bit embarrassing to be honest, but we have to admit that those goofy #NeverTrump people are all college eggheads. Proof that college can make you dumber. \u201d \u201cBut the numbers for those that didn\u2019t graduate college are amazing. A 39% margin for Trump! These are the deplorables, ladies and gentlemen, just as much as the hip millennials posting Pepe on Twitter,\u201d explained MILO. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear about one thing.   educated doesn\u2019t mean stupid. It means you wisely chose not to pay $40, 000 a year to be lectured on microaggressions. Some of the smartest and most successful people in history have been either college dropouts, like me, or people who never attended at all, like a lot of my crew on this tour. \u201d MILO continued to claim that \u201cThey are smarter  \u2014   and so am I  \u2014   than 90 per cent of the people in this room. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re already more successful and they already have more enjoyable jobs and have more political and cultural influence than most of the people in this room. No offense!\u201d he added. \u201cBut my point is that \u2018  educated\u2019 isn\u2019t a synonym for dumb redneck or idiot. A good 50 per cent of the most successful people I know didn\u2019t get a university degree. \u201d \u201cThe split among all voters is also amazing. All college graduates went to Hillary by a 9% margin, while all people without degrees went to Trump by 8%. We haven\u2019t seen this kind of gap since 1980,\u201d stated MILO. \u201cSo rather than smart versus dumb, try to think of this split in cultural terms. When we look at the way counties voted in battleground states, it is a similar story. Trump won Wisconsin by taking 10 counties that typically go Democrat. \u201d \u201cKenosha County has been Democrat since 1972, but it went to Trump. Similar stories and countries exist in every state,\u201d MILO explained. \u201cThe evidence very clearly shows the left lost the white working class. \u201d Written from prepared remarks.
