It is shocking and I have ordered that we stop taking this position (his country\u2019s abstention) even if it means diverging from the position taken by the rest of Europe,\u201d he added. \\nRenzi, who became Prime Minister in 2014 at the relatively young age of 39 knows exactly how the game is played. In order to win favor with Washington, he must first please Tel Aviv. \\nHis country has abstained from the October 12 vote on a resolution that condemns Israel\u2019s violations of the cultural and legal status of Occupied East Jerusalem. This decision has ignited the ire of Israeli Ambassador to Rome, Ofer Zaks , who riled up the Jewish community in Italy to protest the abstention. Renzi, in turn, was converted into a champion of the \u2018Temple Mount\u2019, the name Israel uses to describe the Palestinian Muslim holy site. \\nRenzi cravenly went on damage control mode without truly understanding the nature of the resolution, which merely condemned Israel\u2019s obvious violations of international law, and only calls for Israel to respect the status of Palestinian culture in the occupied city. \\nNone of procedures that led to the vote on the UNESCO\u2019s resolution \u2013 voted\u2026'"}, "time": 1742628560.3983755}
