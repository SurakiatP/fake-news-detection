First, less than half of what we could recycle ends up in our city\u2019s recycling programs, according to a report published last month by the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office. Second, much of what we do try to recycle gets thrown into the wrong bins. \u201cThis makes recycling more expensive, and it makes what\u2019s actually recyclable less valuable,\u201d said Daniel Huber, an environmental analyst with the budget office. For those New Yorkers who have successfully avoided taking the trash to the curb, a quick primer. The Sanitation Department has three main streams for the city\u2019s unwanted stuff  \u2014   one for garbage destined for a landfill, one to recycle paper, and one to recycle metal, glass and plastic. According to the July report, which used Sanitation Department data from 2013, only about a quarter of aluminum cans  \u2014   one of the most valuable recyclable metals  \u2014   makes it into the right bin. And only around 5 percent of our plastic cups, plates and utensils goes to the right place. We do the best job recycling glass, but as it turns out, that\u2019s one of the least valuable types of commodities, Mr. Huber said  \u2014   far less useful than recycled metal and paper. So what can we do to make recycling less painful for us and more efficient for those processing it? \u201cBeing more diligent about making sure stuff doesn\u2019t end up in the wrong recycling stream is the key one,\u201d Mr. Huber told us. Think twice about where your child\u2019s dirty diapers and juice boxes are thrown. Before the    season, recycle last year\u2019s notebooks. (And even electronics.) Don\u2019t scavenge. And take the time to understand what newer recycling categories are being accepted around the city, Mr. Huber added.
