Garland. Democrats and their allies remain furious that Senate Republicans refused to even consider Judge Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to the high court, with 10 months remaining in Mr. Obama\u2019s second term. That deep resentment is certain to color their handling of Mr. Trump\u2019s choice just as it has contributed to their resistance to moving quickly on Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet selections. All indications are that they see the forthcoming nomination as a chance to take a strong stand against the new president, since they still have the power to filibuster a Supreme Court choice  \u2014   at least for now. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the names,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and a veteran of multiple Supreme Court fights. \u201cBut when they had a consensus person with Merrick Garland, every single Republican who raised their hand and solemnly swore before God to uphold the Constitution refused to follow the Constitution and even have a hearing. \u201d Top Democrats say they don\u2019t intend to play \u201ctit for tat\u201d with the nomination. But they say they will insist on what they consider to be a mainstream candidate capable of securing at least the 60 votes needed to thwart any filibuster. Otherwise, they promise to do whatever they can to block the nominee. \u201cWe are not going to do what the Republicans did,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, \u201cbut if the candidate\u2019s out of the mainstream, I can tell you I will fight and my caucus will fight tooth and nail against them. \u201d The chief reason that Democrats will not do what the Republicans did is that they can\u2019t  \u2014   Republicans remain in the Senate majority, which last year enabled them to refuse to even schedule a hearing and now gives them control over the confirmation process. But unlike with cabinet nominees, Democrats could still employ a filibuster against a Supreme Court pick, because the high court was excluded from a 2013 change engineered by Democrats to thwart filibusters against   nominees. If Democrats hold out, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will no doubt come under pressure to wipe out the possibility of filibuster against Supreme Court nominees. Given the steps Republicans were willing to take to hold open the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia, Democrats believe Senate Republicans might choose to eliminate that filibuster power, too. \u201cAll the signals are there is no limit to what they are capable of doing to give the big special interests behind them control of the court,\u201d said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee. But Republicans are already differentiating their handling of Mr. Garland\u2019s nomination from whatever is to come with the announcement by Mr. Trump. They argue that the situations are not comparable, given the timing of the presidential election. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between not approving a Supreme Court nominee in the middle of a highly contested presidential election, and the beginning of a   term,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on Tuesday, noting that Republicans did not filibuster Supreme Court nominees in the first term of either President Bill Clinton or Mr. Obama. Mr. McConnell took pains on Tuesday to note that both Republicans and Democrats were invited to the White House to discuss the coming nomination with Mr. Trump as part of the requirement for seeking the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. Many Republicans and their conservative allies would prefer not to abolish the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees, knowing that it could come back to haunt them by allowing a future Democratic majority a free hand  \u2014   essentially the same reason Democrats left high court nominees out of the 2013 change. It is also unclear whether Republicans would even have the votes to do so through a simple majority vote on an arcane procedural maneuver. But the question will hang over the entire confirmation fight and could force a showdown. If the Democrats filibuster, \u201c then I guess we\u2019ll see what steps need to be taken at the time,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Republican leadership. \u201cBut I think the one thing that we\u2019re committed to is getting a Supreme Court justice confirmed. \u201d Democrats say that one result of the stalemate over Judge Garland is that it has shown that the Supreme Court can function, though imperfectly, without a full complement of nine members, relieving the party of some guilt for keeping the court   if it comes to that over a Trump nominee. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said Democrats were also galvanized by the turnout at last weekend\u2019s protests. He said it would serve as a unifying force for Senate Democrats. \u201cThat swell of people and strength and spirit at the marches we had Saturday showed us we have the American populace on our side,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. \u201cThey understand the importance of the Supreme Court to those issues that brought them to the streets, principally women. \u201d Mr. Blumenthal said the selection of a nominee by President Trump would \u201cput a face and a voice\u201d on the Supreme Court battle. But for now, the face and voice most Democrats are putting on the coming clash are those belonging to Judge Garland.'"}, "time": 1742561721.4365249}
