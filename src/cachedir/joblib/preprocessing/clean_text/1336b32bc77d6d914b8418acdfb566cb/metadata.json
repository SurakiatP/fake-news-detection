His article, however, was particularly popular among those who sees the Syrian government entirely innocent of any culpability in the ongoing war, and that Iran and Russia are at no fault whatsoever; better yet, their intervention in Syria is entirely morally-guided and altruistic.\\nThat said, Kinzer\u2019s assertion regarding the US government\u2019s dangerous meddling in Syria\u2019s affairs, renewed Cold War with Russia and ill-defined military mission in that country, is all true.\\nNeither is the US, nor its western and other allies, following rules of war nor adhering to a particularly noble set of principles aimed at ending that most devastating war, which has killed well over 300,000 people , rendered millions displaced and destroyed the country\u2019s wealth and infrastructure.\\nSo what is the truth on Syria?\\nIn the last five and a half years, since a regional uprising turned into an armed rebellion\u2014turned into civil, regional and international war\u2014\u2019the truth on Syria\u2019, has been segmented into many self-tailored \u2018truths,\u2019 each promoted by one of the warring party to be the one and only, absolute and uncontested reality. But since there are many parties to the conflict, the versions of the \u2018truth\u2019 communicated to us via copious media, are numerous and, most often, unverifiable.\\nThe only truth that all parties seem to agree upon is that hundreds of thousands are dead and Syria is shattered. But, of course, each points to the other side for culpability of the ongoing genocide.\\nAn oddly refreshing, although disturbing \u2018truth\u2019 was articulated by Alon Ben-David in the Israeli Jerusalem Post last year.\\nThe title of his article speaks volumes: \u201c May it never end: The uncomfortable truth about the war in Syria .\u201d\\n\u201cIf Israel\u2019s interest in the war in Syria can be summarized in brief, it would be: That it should never end,\u201d Ben-David wrote.\\n\u201cNo one will say this publicly, but the continuation of the fighting in Syria, as long as there is a recognized authority in Damascus, allows Israel to stay out of the swamp and distance itself from the swarms of mosquitoes that are buzzing in it.\u201d Of course, Israel never truly \u2018stayed out of the swamp\u2019 , but that is for a separate discussion.'"}, "time": 1742561913.6724162}
