Government\u2019 Is Part of an Elite Wave of Propaganda Justifying Violent Repression By - October 31, 2016 \\nThe rise of paranoid politics could make America ungovernable \u2013 and the FBI is fuelling the fire \u2026 Nothing can disprove the fears of a paranoiac. Indeed, everything confirms them \u2026 It takes away politicians\u2019 incentive to understand one another and get things done. It says that if you scream loud enough, established norms will buckle under the pressure. And while those norms might be annoying and flawed, we\u2019ll all miss them if they go. \u2013UK Telegraph \\nWith US belief in \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d over 50 percent (see our previous article here ) elites are showing increasing concern that they have lost control of their narrative. \\nThis article again illustrates elite push back. The article explains that if people grow paranoid about government, then the \u201cnorms\u201d of government will collapse. \\nConspiracy theory is called \u201cparanoid politics\u201d in this article but it amounts to the same thing. \\nThe article also has parallels to an article we analyzed recently here by Cass Sunstein. His Bloomberg editorial suggested that nothing was more important from a political standpoint than returning \u201ccivility\u201d to Congress and politics generally. \\nThis article runs along the same lines: Negative perceptions of the US government can make the process of \u201cgoverning\u201d dysfunctional \\nMore: \\nTake the \u201cchemtrails\u201d conspiracy theory: the idea that the white trails left behind in the sky by aeroplanes are sinister chemicals dispersed to sterilise or control voters. \\nIf a government declares there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of such chemicals, that itself must be clear evidence that there\u2019s something \u201cthey\u201d don\u2019t want us to know. But if that government were to open up an investigation, that too would be incontrovertible proof: \u201cthey\u201d must have found something. \\nLet\u2019s reverse this reasoning. Apparently, one can\u2019t question much that government does because skepticism puts government in a no-win situation. \\nBetter to accept official pronouncements, then. The only trouble is that almost anything modern Western governments say are lies. \\nGovernments aren\u2019t even important these days. The world from what we can tell is run by a small banking elite that controls the awesome power of central banks and the money they print. \\nThe trillions available to this small group has allowed it to change the nature of society around the world. \\nThe goal is global government and every kind of violence and corruption is employed to achieve it. \\nSecrecy is still employed by those creating \u201cone world.\u201d Thus the world is bent on the task of creating global governance while never admitting it. \\nBut in the past several decades, the Internet has credibly exposed plans for world government. As a result, people have lost faith in mainstream media, politicians and capitalism itself. \\nThis is the reason for the rise in \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d and \u201cparanoid politics.\u201d \\nThis is also the reason elites would like to shut down the Internet, or at least control it more thoroughly. \\nPart of the push for control involves making a case that the Internet needs to be better regulated and appropriately censored. \\nTo this end, elite propaganda has been aimed at justifying various anti-\u2018Net actions. \\nOne justification involves the \u201cpopulism versus globalism\u201d meme we\u2019ve covered extensively. (Just use a search engine for the phrase and \u201cDaily Bell.\u201d) \\nAnother justification \u2013 another emergent meme \u2013 is that government itself is jeopardized by pervasive distrust. \\nOne would think the answer would be to lie less, but this is not the conclusion we\u2019re being furnished. \\nBoth Sunstein in his article, and now the argument in this article, show us clearly that the solution to pervasive electoral cyncism and worse is to better control one\u2019s attitude. \\nIn other words, paranoia and conspiratorial cynicism need to be damped for government to survive and perform its proper function. \\nHere: \\nWhy, then, did a seasoned operator like Mr Comey, whose judiciousness was praised by the Clinton campaign through the summer, feel the need to divulge this half-baked and potentially insignificant development before assessing it? There is one answer: fear of the mob. \\nThe director of the FBI \u2013 those tough guys who smash in doors and shoot people \u2013 was scared that if he didn\u2019t talk now and the news leaked out, it would confirm every conspiracy theory going about how the agency was in the Clintons\u2019 pocket. In other words, we\u2019ve reached a point in the politics of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy where the appearance of probity matters more than the reality. \\nThis is a key point in the article. It is one that fully reveals the cognitive dissonance at the heart of this particular argument. The idea is that government is too delicate to sustain itself in the face of the \u201cmob.\u201d The mob must therefore be silenced or \u201cprobity will matter more than reality.\u201d \\nBut who is to determine what constitutes a \u201cmob\u201d? And who is determine that the mob\u2019s \u201creality\u201d is false? \\nBoth the Sunstein article and now this one are erecting very specific kinds of arguments. Government, we are told, is fragile and must be protected from forces that will undermine its credibility. \\nBut this conclusion is merely assumed. It is never proven. \\nThis argument begins and ends with government. Yet the Internet and its recovered history shows us clearly that Western governments mostly provide concealment for the world\u2019s real powers that prefer to operate behind the scenes. \\nThis is the reason for so much cynicism. Many have realized that the society constructed around them is lie. They have reacted by distrusting almost anything associated with modern society. \\nBut in these articles, we can see the forces being marshaled against this state of mind. The preferred antidote is simply to assert that people\u2019s distrust is corrosive to government authority and democracy generally. \\nNo logic bolsters this argument. That\u2019s why it is an emergent elite meme. \\nThe goal of an elite meme is to be convincing not truthful. \\nAnd if it is not convincing \u2013 and increasingly elite memes are not \u2013 then its function is, anyway, to provide a justification for what we call directed history. These are the authoritarian strategies that elites wish to inflict on the rest of us. \\nThis latter meme is an outgrowth of \u201cpopulism versus globalism.\u201d Populists, as we\u2019ve pointed out, are being cast as ignorant, violent and intolerant. The current meme \u2013 let\u2019s call it \u201cconspiracy versus government\u201d\u2013 lumps in conspiracy with populism. \\nPopulists, we learn, are apt to adopt an irrational distrust of government. And what is government? It must comprise all that is good and virtuous in an uncivil world. \\nBoth populists and conspiracy theory are to be vanquished, eventually, by wise globalists who understand that the absence of government will lead to violent \u201canarchy.\u201d \\nWould that it were true. It is not. Government is merely in this day-and-age a curtain hiding the world\u2019s real controllers who use endless violence, monetary debasement and economic depression to get their way. \\nConclusion: We are watching the emergence of a new, dangerous memes. Increasingly and forcefully, it is being argued that \u201cgovernment\u201d is good and that the truths people have discovered about their lives and society are destabilizing to government, and therefore \u201cbad.\u201d The idea will be to use these memes to make a case for increased censorship and even, eventually, violent repression \u2013 and worse.'"}, "time": 1742628538.7011175}
