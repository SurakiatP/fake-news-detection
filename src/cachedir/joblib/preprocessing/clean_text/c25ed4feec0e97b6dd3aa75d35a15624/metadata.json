[The strongly worded message, signed by the Vatican\u2019s secretary of state on behalf of the Pope, called the slaughter a \u201csenseless act of hatred\u201d and a \u201cviolent outrage,\u201d resulting in \u201ctragic loss of life and injury. \u201d  While expressing his \u201cheartfelt solidarity\u201d with all those affected by the attack, Francis said he was particularly mindful of the children who lost their lives when masked gunmen opened fire on a busload of Christian pilgrims on their way to the Monastery of St. Stephen in the Minya province south of Cairo on Friday morning.

The pontiff took the occasion to condemn the attacks, repeating his statement that killing in the name of God is blasphemy. \u201cLet us say once more a firm and clear \u2018No!\u2019 to every form of violence, vengeance and hatred carried out in the name of religion or in the name of God,\u201d the Pope told a peace conference meeting at the   university, Egypt\u2019s highest Islamic authority. The Minya province has the highest Coptic Christian population in the country and has been the scene of a number of attacks on the Christian minority. Christians in Minya have lived in constant fear of attacks from the area\u2019s large Salafi Muslim population. In certain local villages, the faithful celebrate Mass before a cross drawn on a wall, making it easy to erase quickly to avoid attacks. Follow Thomas D.
