[For example, Entertainment Tonight had a report, which was vehemently denied by the NFL, that the league told halftime performer Lady Gaga not to mention   Trump during her show.  Now, Fox has 86\u2019d a Super Bowl ad from 84 Lumber, which includes the depiction of a border wall. According to The New York Post, \u201cThe spot, from 84 Lumber, a first time Super Bowl advertiser, was deemed by Fox to be too controversial, a spokesman for ad agency Brunner told The Post. Fox declined to comment. The two sides are said to be working on a compromise. \u201d Campaign\u2019s Kathryn Luttner provides some description of the ad. Luttner writes, \u201cThe script has been rejected by the network for being \u201ctoo political,\u201d according to sources close to the project. The   spot from   agency Brunner focuses on recruitment and includes images of immigrants unable to cross the border due to \u201cthe wall,\u201d a flashpoint of debate during the 2016 presidential election. \u201d 84 Lumber\u2019s owner and president Maggie Hardy Magerko said in a statement, \u201cOur industry is going through a period of extreme disruption. And I\u2019ve always preferred to be the one doing the disrupting, rather than the one being disrupted. But to do that, we need to hire and train people differently. We need to cast a wider net, and to let the world know that 84 Lumber is a place for people who don\u2019t always fit nicely into a box. We want people interested in creating their own path   \u2026     for themselves and for 84 Lumber. \u201d If getting \u201coutside the box\u201d was the goal of this ad, 84 Lumber definitely achieved that. Still, it\u2019s interesting that the NFL is so tightly policing this particular Super Bowl. They did not exercise such oversight last year when Beyonc\u00e9 performed her extremely   song \u201cFormation,\u201d during the halftime show. Of course, that event occurred during a   and   halftime show and not in a   commercial ad, such as what\u2019s happening here with 84 Lumber. Certainly, 84 Lumber should not be allowed to construct a giant replica border wall during the halftime show, even though that might be the greatest thing ever. But, if a performance that denigrates and endangers police officers can get an entire halftime show, a   border wall commercial can get some love, right? Probably not.
