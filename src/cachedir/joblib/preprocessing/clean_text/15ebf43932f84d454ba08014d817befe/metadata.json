Ms. Banks bought her Riverhouse apartment, at 2 River Terrace, in 2009 and used it as a primary residence for about four years. But she has been spending most of her time lately on the West Coast, where she has homes in Los Angeles and Northern California, and so she has been renting out the unit since May 2015, for $50, 000 a month furnished. Tyra Beauty, her new cosmetics company, is also based in Los Angeles, as are various entertainment projects. (Ms. Banks is the new   of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d and will be returning to the show she helped create, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model. \u201d) The Lower Manhattan apartment, which overlooks Rockefeller Park, is being offered for both rent (at $50, 000 a month) and for sale, with an asking price of $17. 5 million and monthly carrying costs of $16, 644, according to the listing broker, Adam D. Modlin of the Modlin Group. Ms. Banks, 43, who last year became a parent for the first time with her photographer boyfriend, Erik Asla, said she would prefer to sell the place rather than continue leasing it out, although she admits that she \u201cwill miss the feeling of having a home in the sky. \u201d When she bought it, she said in an email, she intended to create a space that felt less like an apartment and more \u201clike a   home with finishes and an experience like one would have in the Hamptons or even in an estate in Los Angeles. \u201d She seemed to have succeeded, at least when it comes to its sprawl and flourishes. The    duplex, No. 22D, is actually a combination of four units at the   Riverhouse  \u2014   three on the 22nd floor and one on the 23rd  \u2014   that were acquired for $10. 13 million. Ms. Banks said she spent almost as much on the extensive renovations and d\u00e9cor, which incorporate rich fabrics, textured wall coverings, exotic wood details and ornate light fixtures. The apartment also has surround sound,   oak floors and ample storage throughout. \u201cNew amazing ideas just kept coming and coming to me,\u201d Ms. Banks said of the renovations, which dragged on for several months. The layout of the apartment was configured to provide maximum privacy  \u2014   for staff, business associates, family and guests  \u2014   with various wings that can be closed off from the rest of the unit. There are five bedrooms, five full bathrooms and three powder rooms, along with several kitchens and kitchenettes. The home is entered through a hallway on the main level that leads to a spacious living room with a connecting   room. Several feet away are the family room and open chef\u2019s kitchen. The kitchen has two Miele dishwashers and other   appliances, along with a butler\u2019s pantry, a copper sink and an island of zebrawood, to name a few features. Nearby is a dining alcove with banquette seating that, Ms. Banks said, was meant to resemble \u201ca booth at a   restaurant. \u201d These main entertaining rooms face    windows that offer expansive views of the river and beyond. \u201cThere\u2019s the Statue of Liberty, all the ferryboats from the New York Waterway and the Midtown skyline,\u201d Mr. Modlin said. The lower level contains the gym, mirrored dressing room, salon and laundry area. Also there are offices and a staff suite with another full kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom. The staff suite has an additional entrance. And if all that were not enough, there is another   suite with a kitchenette, for guests. \u201cShe created different spaces,\u201d Mr. Modlin said, \u201cso you can have different things going on in the home. \u201d On the second level are another   bedroom and an enormous master suite, which features a sitting area, kitchenette and   shag carpeting. There are dual master bathrooms and dressing rooms, and a large marble soaking tub encased in white oak. The   Riverhouse development, which received a gold certification in the LEED environmental building rating system, offers amenities like a   concierge, valet parking, a yoga studio and fitness center, and a saltwater lap pool. It also has as a resident the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who, like Ms. Banks, has created his own compound there. Ms. Banks said the two never ran into each other in the building. \u201cHe was always that elusive spirit that so many people talked about,\u201d she said. \u201cFarewell, Leo. I\u2019ll miss my houseguests trying to spot you in our building. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561916.2602737}
