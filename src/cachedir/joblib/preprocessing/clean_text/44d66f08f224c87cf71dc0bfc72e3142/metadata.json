He is a joke,\u201d Toure told host Joy Reid. \u201cTo really shoot him in a video would be like, why are you going that far? This man isn\u2019t worthy of all that. So, of course, he makes it a joke,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is a lot of anger about him, but he is so ridiculous that he becomes a joke. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742562763.1775463}
