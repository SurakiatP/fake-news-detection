Late Saturday night, the Yankees had announced a news conference with Rodriguez to be held before Sunday\u2019s game against the Cleveland Indians. Severino, his teammates and Manager Joe Girardi had been given little indication of the purpose of the news conference before Rodriguez announced his plans to end his playing days after Friday\u2019s game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium. Severino, 22, is one of several players from the Yankees\u2019 farm system who will be expected to usher in a new era. The announcement of Rodriguez\u2019s retirement came two days after Mark Teixeira had announced his own plans to depart baseball after this season. Combined with a series of trades of veterans over the last week, the Yankees have all but officially closed the chapter on an era of exorbitant signings. \u201cClearly, there\u2019s transition going on right now,\u201d General Manager Brian Cashman said before the Yankees\u2019   win over the Indians. \u201cThis roster has been getting younger the last few years. It\u2019s by intent and is stated publicly and something that\u2019s necessary. I think it\u2019s an exciting time, because there is some young blood that is coming in here. They have big dreams, and they have big hopes. \u201d Over the past week, the Yankees have kept up a facade by declaring themselves still contenders, despite having dealt Aroldis Chapman, Andrew Miller, Carlos Beltran and Ivan Nova before the nonwaiver trading deadline. On Sunday, while addressing questions mainly relating to Rodriguez, Girardi also conceded that the club was undergoing a \u201ctransition. \u201d Catcher Brian McCann said the Yankees had contributed to the housecleaning by not winning more. \u201cThis game, you see kind of how teams are winning, when you can get   prospects  \u2014    that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d McCann said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of good prospects in this organization that are impact players. \u201d He added, \u201cSome guys were coming off the books, and it was a business decision that they had to make. \u201d Several players praised Rodriguez. C. C. Sabathia called him the best player of his generation. Outfielder Brett Gardner said: \u201cThe ultimate way to go out is on your own terms. Tex is getting the opportunity to do that, and it\u2019s sad to see that Alex isn\u2019t. \u201d The decision to part with Rodriguez was not a simple one. This summer, amid declining production, Rodriguez became a platoon player and was finally benched outright. His future hovered over the team like a dark cloud. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough week,\u201d Girardi said Sunday. Then, alluding to Teixeira\u2019s retirement, he added: \u201cTo lose guys like this, it\u2019s hard. Alex has meant a ton to me. This has been a tough month. Obviously, it\u2019s a hot topic every day, and it\u2019s not an easy topic to talk about, so it\u2019s taken its toll. \u201d After the Rodriguez saga reached its conclusion, Masahiro Tanaka threw his first pitch of the afternoon with nary a cloud in the sky above the field. Tanaka pounded the corners of the strike zone against the Indians, shutting them out for the first six innings as the Yankees took a   lead. Gardner scored after leading off the bottom of the first with a triple, Didi Gregorius hit a solo home run, and Teixeira added a   double. Tanaka struck out eight and was charged with one run over   innings, improving to  . \u201cIt was probably his best start of the year,\u201d said Girardi, who bolstered his case by adding that Tanaka had pitched on only four days\u2019 rest. Entering Sunday, Tanaka was   with a 4. 95 E. R. A. with four days between starts and   and 1. 87 with five days. On Tuesday, Severino will start against the Red Sox in Boston, his first start since May 13, after which he was injured and sent for rehabilitation in Class AAA  . \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Severino said. \u201cWe were one of the teams that had more veterans, and now we only have, like, two or three. It\u2019s different. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563098.4903767}
