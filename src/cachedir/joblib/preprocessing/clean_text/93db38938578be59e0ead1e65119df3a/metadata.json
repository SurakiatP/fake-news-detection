The defiant posture reflected a bristling anger among Israel\u2019s   political leaders, who not only blamed the United States for failing to block the Council resolution, but also claimed to have secret intelligence showing that President Obama\u2019s team had orchestrated it. American officials strongly denied the claim, but the sides seem poised for more weeks of conflict until Mr. Obama hands over the presidency to Donald J. Trump. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lashed out at Security Council countries by curbing diplomatic contacts, recalling envoys, cutting off aid and summoning the American ambassador for a scolding. He canceled a planned visit this week by Ukraine\u2019s prime minister even as he expressed concern on Monday that Mr. Obama was planning more action at the United Nations before his term ends next month. The prime minister defended his retaliation. \u201cIsrael is a country with national pride, and we do not turn the other cheek,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a responsible, measured and vigorous response, the natural response of a healthy people that is making it clear to the nations of the world that what was done at the U. N. is unacceptable to us. \u201d The Security Council resolution that passed Friday condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as a \u201cflagrant violation under international law\u201d and an obstacle to peace. The Council approved it 14 to 0, with the United States abstaining instead of using its unilateral veto, as it has in the past. Mr. Trump publicly pressed for a veto of the resolution and has chosen a settlement advocate as his administration\u2019s ambassador to Israel. He turned to Twitter on Monday night to air complaints that the United Nations \u201cis just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. \u201d Palestinian leaders made clear that they would use the resolution in international bodies to press their case against Israel. With the imprimatur of a United Nations finding of illegality, they said, they will campaign to require that other countries not just label products made in the settlements, but ban them. \u201cNow we can talk about the boycott of all settlements, the companies that work with them, et cetera, and actually take legal action against them if they continue to work with them,\u201d Riad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister, was quoted as saying by the Palestinian news media. He outlined other steps the Palestinians could now take, using the resolution to press the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders, file lawsuits on behalf of specific Palestinians displaced by settlements and urge the international authorities to determine whether Israel is violating the Geneva Conventions. \u201cWe are looking to devise a comprehensive vision, and hopefully 2017 will be the year when the Israeli occupation ends,\u201d Mr. Malki said. Israeli officials said such pronouncements showed that the resolution actually undermined chances for a negotiated settlement because the Palestinians now have less incentive to come to the table. By declaring Israeli settlements illegal, they said, the United Nations essentially took away the one chip that Israel had to trade, meaning land. \u201cThe Palestinians are waging a diplomatic and legal war against Israel. That\u2019s the strategy,\u201d Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, said in a phone interview. \u201cTheir strategy is not to negotiate an agreement with Israel because a deal is give and take. They want take and take. \u201d Israel\u2019s settlement project, once a scattering of houses across the   Green Line marking the borders before the 1967   war, has grown substantially over the years. In 2009, the year Mr. Obama took office, 297, 000 people lived in West Bank settlements and 193, 737 in East Jerusalem. That increased to 386, 000 in the West Bank by the end of last year and 208, 000 in East Jerusalem by the end of 2014, according to Peace Now, a group that opposes settlements. Israeli officials note that when Mr. Netanyahu acquiesced to a   settlement freeze sought by Mr. Obama in 2009, the Palestinians still did not agree to negotiate until just before time ran out. But the addition of more than 100, 000 settlers during Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure convinced him that it was time to change his approach at the United Nations, aides said. The 618 housing units to be granted building permits in East Jerusalem on Wednesday have been in the works for a while, and the planning committee meeting agenda was set before the United Nations acted. But the committee chairman said he was determined to go forward with units totaling 5, 600. \u201cI won\u2019t get worked up over the U. N. or any other organization that might try to dictate to us what to do in Jerusalem,\u201d Deputy Mayor Meir Turgeman, the planning committee chairman, told the newspaper Israel Hayom. \u201cI hope that the government and the new administration in the United States will give us momentum to continue. \u201d Although he did not specify which projects he had in mind, Ir Amim, a private group tracking settlements in East Jerusalem, said he was probably referring to projects in Gilo and Givat Hamatos. Betty Herschman, the group\u2019s director of international relations and advocacy, said it was \u201cdefiance demonstrated after Trump\u2019s election, now reinforced by the U. N. resolution. \u201d Anat Ben Nun, the director of development and external relations for Peace Now, said such construction was problematic. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s attempt to avenge the U. N. S. C. resolution through approval of plans beyond the Green Line will only harm Israelis and Palestinians by making it more difficult to arrive at a   solution,\u201d she said. Israeli leaders said they had no reason to stop building. The Security Council resolution \u201cwas absurd and totally removed from reality,\u201d said Oded Revivi, chief foreign envoy for the Yesha Council, which represents West Bank settlers. \u201cIsraeli building policies are set in Jerusalem, not New York. \u201d For the fourth day, Israeli officials accused Mr. Obama\u2019s team of ambushing them at the United Nations. While the White House denied it, Israeli officials pointed to a meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his New Zealand counterpart a month before the Council vote discussing a resolution on the   conflict. New Zealand was a sponsor of Friday\u2019s measure. Mr. Dermer, the ambassador, said Israel had other, nonpublic information proving the Obama administration\u2019s involvement but provided no evidence and would not elaborate beyond saying it would be provided to Mr. Trump\u2019s team when he takes office. \u201cThey not only did not get up and stop it, they were behind it from the beginning,\u201d Mr. Dermer said. \u201cThis is why the prime minister is so angry. We\u2019re going to stand up against it. \u201d Israeli officials worried that Mr. Kerry would use a coming speech or a conference in France to outline an American peace plan that would be hostile to Israel\u2019s interests. Mr. Kerry\u2019s office had no comment. The fury of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s response has generated debate at home. Mitchell Barak, a political consultant, said the political left considered the resolution \u201can epic foreign policy and diplomatic debacle\u201d by Mr. Netanyahu. But to his base, the Security Council action confirmed what they believed all along, that Mr. Obama is inherently   and so the prime minister comes across as a champion beset by enemies. \u201cFor them,\u201d Mr. Barak said, \u201cNetanyahu emerges from this unscathed, as the lone wolf in a lion\u2019s den of hatred. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562284.3712466}
