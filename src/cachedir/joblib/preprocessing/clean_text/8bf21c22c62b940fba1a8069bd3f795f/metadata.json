[But Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said its World Vision funding in Gaza would remain suspended while Israeli charges against the global aid agency\u2019s Gaza manager Mohammed   remain unresolved.  \u201cDFAT has reviewed the management of its funding to World Vision in the Palestinian Territories. The review uncovered nothing to suggest any diversion of government funds. \u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cAustralia\u2019s funding to World Vision in the Palestinian Territories remains suspended until we have considered the outcomes of the court case against Mr.   and reviews being undertaken by World Vision Australia and World Vision International into this issue,\u201d it added. Australian is the biggest single donor to World Vision\u2019s humanitarian work in Gaza, providing more than $2 million in the past three years. Australia and Germany suspended funding in August after Israeli authorities charged   with diverting around $50 million to Hamas to help build tunnels and purchase weapons. Israel\u2019s internal security service Shin Bet alleged   created fictitious humanitarian projects to get the funds to Hamas. The Shin Bet alleged he underwent Hamas training in the early 2000s and was \u201cplanted\u201d by the group at World Vision in 2005, where he climbed the ranks to become director of the Gaza branch.   has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Israel\u2019s Justice Ministry declined to comment on  \u2019s case because his trial was ongoing. World Vision welcomed Australia\u2019s findings, adding that its own ongoing audit had not yet raised concerns about how money was spent. World Vision\u2019s work in Gaza has been suspended pending the outcome of that audit. \u201cWe remain deeply concerned with this situation, and are saddened by the impact on Gaza\u2019s children and their families,\u201d a World Vision statement said.'"}, "time": 1742561945.66276}
