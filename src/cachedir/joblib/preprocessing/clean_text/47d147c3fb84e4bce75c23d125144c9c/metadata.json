[A redoubtable evangelizer and culture warrior, Chaput lays out a road map for living the Christian faith in a   world in his new work Strangers in a Strange Land, due for release on February 21.  Though the Archbishop deals with a multitude of topics from the decay of modern democracies to millennials\u2019 dread of commitment, his words on abortion ring with particular force on a day when tens of thousands march on Washington DC in defense of the right to life. Chaput notes that important strides have been made in the past half century and that today \u201cmany American young people are more committedly   than their parents and even their grandparents. \u201d \u201cThis seems ironic, but it shouldn\u2019t surprise,\u201d he observes. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen what abortion does. They\u2019ve lived with the fact that they could have been aborted. The humanity of the unborn child is obvious on any ultrasound machine. \u201d Still, Chaput argues, a fear of living \u201coutside the cone of public approval\u201d leads many to shirk their personal responsibility for changing society. In the case of abortion, \u201cmany of us are happy to live with   and ambiguity rather than risk being cut out of the herd. The culture of lies thrives on our own complicity, lack of courage, and   deception. \u201d The Archbishop also assails \u201cchronic newsroom prejudice\u201d in the shaping of certain kinds of news, especially in the abortion debate, as evidenced by the wildly imbalanced coverage of the   Women\u2019s March on Washington this week as compared with the annual March for Life. Thus, \u201cPlanned Parenthood is assumed good, while critics who secretly film its cynicism, profiteering, and barbarism are assumed bad,\u201d he notes. Meanwhile, \u201cthe language of \u2018abortion rights,\u2019 common in most newsrooms, has the familiar Orwellian ring of avoiding an unpleasant reality (killing a child in utero) by calling it something else,\u201d he notes. \u201cThus does the magic of words rework the sinews of the universe. \u201d The Archbishop reserves some choice expressions to summarize the last eight years under the Obama administration. \u201cThe White House elected to power in November 2008 campaigned on compelling promises of hope, change, and bringing the nation together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality it delivered for eight years was rather different: a brand of leadership that was narcissistic, aggressively secular, ideologically divisive, resistant to compromise, unwilling to accept responsibility for its failures, and generous in spreading blame. \u201d Nowhere was the aggressively secular agenda more evident than in the matter of abortion and religious freedom. \u201cThe same intolerance marked the administration\u2019s fight to coerce abortion and contraceptive services as part of national health care,\u201d Chaput contends. \u201cIt tenaciously refused reasonable compromise on exemptions for religiously affiliated providers and organizations and deliberately sought to break any opposition \u2014   prompting a sardonic Wall Street Journal editorial renaming the Little Sisters of the Poor \u2018the Little Sisters of the Government. \u2019\u201d And thus, we live in an age \u201cwhen almost every scientific advance seems to be matched by some new cruelty in our entertainment, cynicism in our politics, ignorance of the past, consumer greed, subtle genocides posing as rights like the cult of abortion, and a basic confusion about what \u2014  if anything distinctive at all \u2014  it means to be human,\u201d he argues. Fortunately, the book deals not only with diagnosing our diseases but also in prescribing remedies for them \u2014  mostly in the form of more authentic engagement with the deeper truths of human existence and a bracing evangelism capable of rendering the Christian message winsome and liberating in a world jaded by disbelief.
