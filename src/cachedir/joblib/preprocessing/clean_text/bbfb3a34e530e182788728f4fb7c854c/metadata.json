[Songs of Experience, the band\u2019s   to its   2014 album Songs of Innocence, was \u201cpretty much complete,\u201d U2 founding guitarist The Edge told Rolling Stone. Then Trump won the election and \u201csuddenly the world changed. \u201d  \u201cWe just went, \u2018Hold on a second  \u2014   we\u2019ve got to give ourselves a moment to think about this record and about how it relates to what\u2019s going on in the world,\u2019\u201d the guitarist said about the upcoming project. Trump\u2019s election, he noted, was \u201clike a pendulum has suddenly just taken a huge swing in the other direction. \u201d He noted that most of the album\u2019s lyrics were \u201cwritten in the early part of 2016,\u201d and now need to be revised because \u201cthe world is a different place. \u201d U2, seeing its next record as an opportunity to make a political statement, knew it needed to put the album \u201con ice for a minute, just to really think about it one more time before putting it out, just to make sure that it really was what we wanted to say. \u201d \u201cWe may even write a couple of new songs because that\u2019s the very position we\u2019re in,\u201d the guitarist said. \u201cWe\u2019ve given ourselves a little bit of breathing space for creativity. \u201d \u201cSo we said look, \u2018Look, let\u2019s do both. We can really celebrate this album, which is really born again in this context, and we can also really get a chance to think about these songs and make sure they\u2019re really what we want to put out,\u2019\u201d he added. U2 has remained relatively quiet during the presidential election, though the band\u2019s frontman Bono called Trump \u201cdangerous,\u201d and said he\u2019s \u201cpotentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. \u201d \u201cLook, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with, but Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America,\u201d Bono said in September on CBS This Morning. \u201cPotentially,\u201d he added, Trump \u201ccould destroy\u201d America. A month later, Bono bashed Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall on the U. S.  border during a concert in San Francisco. Bono could be seen screaming \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d at an onstage projection of   Trump. \u201cGood people are not going to stay silent while you run off with the American dream!\u201d Bono shouted during the elaborate, virtual   .  On Monday, U2 announced a tour of North America and Europe to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its first album, The Joshua Tree.
