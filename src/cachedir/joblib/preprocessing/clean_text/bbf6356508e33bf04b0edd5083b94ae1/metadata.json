I guarantee you: when war becomes that profitable, we\u2019re going to see more of it. \u2013 Chalmers Johnson \\nUntil it is no longer the case that M ost US C itizens H ave N o I dea W hat O ur G overnment D oes O r W ho I t S erves , I am just going to continue to insist that #muchniwogdowis is simply the GREATEST ACRONYM EVAR \u2122!!!11!!! Today\u2019s demonstration of its awesomeness is an Op-Ed in The Nation by former Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) entitled Why Is the Foreign Policy Establishment Spoiling for More War? Look at Their Donors . He is \u201cfed up with the DC policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other people\u2019s lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s kind of adorable that Kucinich thinks our country has some sort of \u201csacred honor\u201d going for it. Nevertheless, I have always liked this d00d. \\nKucinich brought Articles of Impeachment against Dick Cheney and George W. Bush for high crimes and misdemeanors in connection with the Iraq war. His efforts went precisely nowhere (\u201cimpeachment is not on our agenda.\u201d -Nancy Pelosi). When he ran for president in 2008, Kucinich\u2019s platform included : single-payer universal health care; bans on offshore drilling, toxic pesticides and privatizing Social Security; legalizing pot and ending the War on Drugs; and\u2014my personal favorite\u2014creating a cabinet-level \u201c Department of Peace \u201d to foster international cooperation. That last one naturally made him the laughingstock of the beltway press, punditocracy and Congress. There\u2019s no money in peace FFS! Well, not for the right people anyway. NO ONE WANTS THAT. When Kucinich ran for a newly redistricted House seat in 2012, he was defeated in the Democratic primary by Marcy Kaptur (D- Forced Birth Brigades ). \\nIn the Op-ed Kucinich goes after DC\u2019s so-called \u201cthink tanks,\u201d and the Brookings Institute in particular. He notes that Brookings, \u201c in a report to Congress , admitted it received $250,000 from the US Central Command, Centcom\u2026Pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war?\u201d And the Generals\u2019 preferred war policies isn\u2019t the only thing Brookings is shilling for: as Kucinich notes, the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of transportation and the US Department of Health and Human Services all give money\u2014taxpayer money\u2014to Brookings, which in turn promotes these agencies\u2019 preferred policies to Congress and the press with the sheen of academic gravitas and objectivity. \\nKuchinich says: \\n\u201cIt is our patriotic duty to expose why the DC foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes.\u201d \\nWhy? Because from their perspective these are not failures\u2014not at all. See, what informed, rational citizens who value the security and wellbeing of humanity here and around the globe might call \u201cfucking epic foreign policy disasters,\u201d are instead for the bipartisan DC establishment wicked smart, wildly successful, solid business decisions. \\nDennis Kucinich knows this of course; the point of his article is to shed some light on the real winners of our wars, and some of the dynamics at work that virtually ensure their continued victory. He\u2019s just connecting the dots into a picture that anyone can see if we cared to look. Generally speaking, we don\u2019t. It\u2019s an ugly picture. \\nI think I\u2019ll just close with the hallowed words of preeminent 20th century philosopher Boy George : \\nWar is stupid, and people are stupid And love means nothing in some strange quarters. \\nHave a nice day.
