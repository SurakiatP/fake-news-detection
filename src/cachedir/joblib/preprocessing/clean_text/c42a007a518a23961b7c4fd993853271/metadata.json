Some have moved away from this area because of it. I don\u2019t go out with a handbag any more.\u201d \\nCommunity workers say many muggings are committed by members of other minorities living in the area, generally of Arab or African origin. \\nParis officials corroborated the figures but declined to identify the robbers by ethnic origin. \\nMany Chinese immigrants own restaurants or shops and tend to be relatively well-off, but are often reluctant to go to the police. \u201cSome victims have been illegal immigrants,\u201d said Dominique Darden, a social worker. \\nThe Chinese community of Paris has held other protests in recent years over the attacks. \\n\u201cThey happen almost every day because of poverty but it\u2019s unbearable,\u201d said a spokesman, Olivier Wang. \u201cNo one should have to put up with this.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563461.530536}
