Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. \\nIt doesn\u2019t help that white voters can\u2019t agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they\u2019ll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. \\nThe sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats \u2013 the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. \\nThe people who will be worse off are everybody else \u2013 the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. \\nLook to Mexico for your future \u2013 or any Third World country. Or to Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) \\nExplaining Latino culture\u2019s acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that \u201cthe male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. \u2026 Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.\u201d \\nOne American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an \u201copen mind\u201d about child rape because \u201cit\u2019s a cultural thing.\u201d \\nWhen it comes to multiculturalism, you can\u2019t say, We love the empanadas \u2013 but we don\u2019t want 40-year-old men raping their nieces . This isn\u2019t an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures we\u2019re importing. \\nAs described in excruciating detail in \u201cAdios, America: The Left\u2019s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole,\u201d our media already have a totally \u201copen mind\u201d about incest and child rape \u2013 and murder! \u2013 when it\u2019s committed by immigrants. \\nThus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline: \u201cIllegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape,\u201d the Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press went with the less catchy: \u201cMan guilty in case of human smuggling.\u201d \\nAnd where I would have used the headline, \u201cIllegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14-year-old Girl at Job Site,\u201d the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, \u201cColumbus resident charged with molestation.\u201d \\nImmigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too \u2013 provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. \\nIn 1989, Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from \u201ctraditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood.\u201d The female head of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. \\nSomewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. (Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing!) \\nIn 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. \\nWhen the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. (That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants!) \\nEven if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for \u201cAustin men.\u201d Or \u201cTwo.\u201d \\nCompare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack: \\n\u2013 \u201cTwo held in attack on child\u201d \u2013 Austin American-Statesman (Texas), July 19, 2013 \\n\u2013 \u201cTwo Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack\u201d \u2013 Daily Mail Online, July 24, 2013 \\nNeedless to say, the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal-alien gang rape at all. \\nThe ultimate primer on the \u201cblue-collar billionaire\u201d\u2014 order Ann Coulter\u2019s book \u201cIn Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!\u201d \\nBy contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape \u2013 of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. \\nThe second case only was \u201crape\u201d because of the girl\u2019s young age \u2013 she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. \\nThose rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. The defendants were African-American. The victim was Mexican. \\nThat time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made the New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. \\nSimilarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. One suspect was African-American, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one? \\nWhen excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square (another one of Hillary\u2019s foreign policy successes!), journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. \\nConclusion: The real problem was the female reporters\u2019 American bosses and colleagues. (Definitely not Islam!) \\nSampling of New York Times commentary on Logan\u2019s rape: \\n\u2013 \u201cWhy We Need Women in War Zones\u201d (\u201cI would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. \u2026 This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.\u201d) \\n\u2013 \u201cReporting While Female\u201d (\u201cWomen reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. \u2026 In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment.\u201d) \\nPerhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. \\nManifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans \u2013 or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. (The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher.) \\nOur country will be Zimbabwe, but \u2013 if all goes according to the Democrats\u2019 plan \u2013 they\u2019ll get to be Mugabe! \\nThat\u2019s Hillary\u2019s dream. If she wins, Joe Sobran\u2019s parody of the typical New York Times headline (about anything) will come true: \u201cWomen and Minorities Hit Hardest.\u201d Receive Ann Coulter's weekly commentaries in your email BONUS: By signing up for Ann Coulter\u2019s alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from WND via email.
