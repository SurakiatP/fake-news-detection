Rogers, appeared in front of the House Intelligence Committee on Monday. Following are excerpts from their testimony, as transcribed by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, follow our live briefing. COMEY: Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Schiff, members of the committee, thank you for including me in today\u2019s hearing. I\u2019m honored to be here representing the people of the FBI. I hope we have shown you through our actions and our words how much we at the FBI value your oversight of our work and how much we respect your responsibility to investigate those things are important to the American people. Thank you for showing that both are being taken very seriously. As you know, our practice is not to confirm the existence of ongoing investigations, especially those investigations that involve classified matters, but in unusual circumstances where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so as Justice Department policies recognize. This is one of those circumstances. I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts. As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. Because it is an open ongoing investigation and is classified, I cannot say more about what we are doing and whose conduct we are examining. At the request of congressional leaders, we have taken the extraordinary step in coordination with the Department of Justice of briefing this Congress\u2019 leaders, including the leaders of this committee, in a classified setting in detail about the investigation but I can\u2019t go into those details here. I know that is extremely frustrating to some folks. I hope you and the American people can understand. The FBI is very careful in how we handle information about our cases and about the people we are investigating. SCHIFF: Director Comey, I want to begin by attempting to put to rest several claims made by the president about his predecessor, namely that President Obama wiretapped his phones. So that we can be precise, I want to refer you to exactly what the president said and ask you whether there is any truth to it. First, the president claimed, quote, \u201cTerrible. Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism,\u201d unquote. Director Comey, was the president\u2019s statement that Obama had his wires tapped in Trump Tower a true statement? COMEY: With respect to the president\u2019s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI. The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components. The department has no information that supports those tweets. NUNES: Thank you, Director Comey. Admiral Rogers, first I wanna go to you. On January 6th, 2017, the intelligence community assessment assessing Russian activities and intentions in recent U. S. elections, stated that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying. So my question as of today, Admiral Rogers, do you have any evidence that Russia cyber actors changed vote tallies in the state of Michigan? ROGERS: No I do not, but I would highlight we are a foreign intelligence organization, not a domestic intelligence organization. So it would be fair to say, we are probably not the best organization to provide a more complete answer. NUNES: How about the state of Pennsylvania? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: The state of Wisconsin? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: State of Florida? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: The state of North Carolina? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: The state of Ohio? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: So  \u2014   so you have no intelligence that suggests, or evidence that suggests, any votes were changed? ROGERS: I have nothing generated by the national security industry, sir. NUNES: Director Comey, do you have any evidence at the FBI that any votes were changed in the states that I mentioned to Admiral Rogers? COMEY: No. GOWDY: I guess what I\u2019m getting at, Director Comey, is you say it\u2019s vital, you say it\u2019s critical, you say it\u2019s indispensable. We both know it\u2019s a threat to the reauthorization of 702 later on this fall. And by the way, it\u2019s also a felony punishable by up to 10 years. So how would you begin your investigation, assuming for the sake of argument that a U. S. citizen\u2019s name appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times unlawfully. Where would you begin that investigation? COMEY: Well, I\u2019m not gonna talk about any particular investigation. .. GOWDY: That\u2019s why I said in theory. COMEY: You would start by figuring out, so who are the suspects? Who touched the information that you\u2019ve concluded ended up unlawfully in the newspaper and start with that universe and then use investigative tools and techniques to see if you can eliminate people, or include people as more serious suspects. GOWDY: Do you know whether Director Clapper knew the name of the U. S. citizen that appeared in the New York Times and Washington Post? COMEY: I can\u2019t say in this forum because again, I don\u2019t wanna confirm that there was classified information in the newspaper. GOWDY: Would he have access to an unmasked name? COMEY: In  \u2014   in some circumstances, sure, he was the director of national intelligence. But I\u2019m not talking about the particular. GOWDY: Would Director Brennan have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen\u2019s name? COMEY: In some circumstances, yes. GOWDY: Would National Security Adviser Susan Rice have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen\u2019s name? COMEY: I think any  \u2014   yes, in general, and any other national security adviser would, I think, as a matter of their ordinary course of their business. GOWDY: Would former White House Advisor Ben Rhodes have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen\u2019s name? COMEY: I don\u2019t know the answer to that. GOWDY: Would former Attorney General Loretta Lynch have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen\u2019s name? COMEY: In general, yes, as would any attorney general. GOWDY: So that would also include Acting AG Sally Yates? COMEY: Same answer. GOWDY: Did you brief President Obama on  \u2014   well, I\u2019ll just ask you. Did you brief President Obama on any calls involving Michael Flynn? COMEY: I\u2019m not gonna get into either that particular case that matter, or any conversations I had with the president. So I can\u2019t answer that.'"}, "time": 1742563318.5547335}
