They know POTUS and HRC emailed . Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet\u2019s email addresses.\\nPerhaps while the DOJ/FBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedin\u2019s emails, it can also take a repeat look at some of these, especially the ones involving POTUS.
