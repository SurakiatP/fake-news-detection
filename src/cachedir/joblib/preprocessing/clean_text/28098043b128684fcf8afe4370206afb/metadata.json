Just over a week after the election, Hillary made her first public appearance again, though she looked a bit worse for wear. Nonetheless, she stuck to the script and talked up the importance of supporting children, more than once quoting Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s statement, \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\u201d Apparently, it was a gig that had been planned to parallel the first event she made with Bill just after his election back in 1992. \\nHer admission at being disappointed by the election is surprise, but it is a sign that she doesn\u2019t plan on going away, and may well be around, though in what capacity isn\u2019t clear. \\nWar-Torn Hillary Emerges: \u201cI Will Admit, Coming Here Tonight Wasn\u2019t The Easiest Thing\u201d \\nby Tyler Durden\\nHillary emerged from hiding today, for the first time since her concession speech on November 9th, to give a speech at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund gala in Washington D.C. The weathered look on her face indicated that she\u2019s had a pretty rough week and maybe a \u201cmedical episode\u201d or two. That said, we suspect her typical $250,000 \u2013 $500,000 speaking fee was simply too much to pass up\u2026crying in bed with the dogs can wait just one day.\\n\u201cI will admit, coming here tonight wasn\u2019t the easiest thing for me. There have been a few times this past week where all I wanted to do was curl up with a good book and our dogs and never leave the house again. \u201d\\nWhile the idea of the Clintons retiring from the public eye forever would certainly be welcome news for about half of the country, somehow we suspect that\u2019s not likely to happen.\\nHillary\u2019s comments , among other things, touched on the disappointment of the election results which she is clearly still trying to absorb herself.\\n\u201cI know many of you are deeply disappointed by the results of the election. I am too, more than I can ever express.\u201d \\n\u201cBut as I said last week, our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love, and building an America that is hopeful, inclusive and big hearted.\u201d\\n\u201cFor the sake of our children, and our families and our country, I ask you to stay engaged, stay engaged on every level.\u201d \\n\u201c The divisions laid bare by this election run deep , but please listen to me when I say this. America is worth it, our children are worth it.\u201d\\n\u201c Believe in our country, fight for our values and never, ever give up .\u201d\\nAs Bloomberg points out, Hillary\u2019s appearance at the event was planned before election day and was supposed to be a post-election victory lap since it was also the first event the Clinton\u2019s attended after Bill\u2019s election.\\nClinton\u2019s appearance was planned before Election Day and, had she won, would have been a clear signal that she was staying true to her roots. Instead, it was an opportunity for her to begin to chart a path ahead after a loss she didn\u2019t expect and a wake of sorts for ardent supporters and staff. Marian Wright Edelman, the Children\u2019s Defense Fund\u2019s founder, described the event as \u201ca love-in for our dear friend\u201d and noted Clinton has a lead of more than 1 million in the popular vote. \u201cShe is the people\u2019s president!\u201d\\nClinton didn\u2019t hint at her future plans except to suggest that she\u2019ll keep doing what she\u2019s done throughout her career. \u201cAmerica is still the greatest country in the world. this is still the place where anyone can beat the odds. It\u2019s up to each and every one of us to keep working to make America better and stronger and fairer,\u201d she said.\\nIronically, Hillary still said nothing to the 1,000\u2019s of violent rioters in NYC, Oakland and Portland who have decided that destroying other people\u2019s property is the appropriate way to deal with their grief. \\nWith that, here are Hillary\u2019s full remarks:\\n\\nThis article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge .
