Initially, he thought he had accidentally driven up on his flower bed, but once he took a closer look, he realized there was a hole in the ground. There was also a ladder in the hole, but nothing could have prepared him for what he\u2019d find when he daringly went down. \\nSimon Marks was pulling out of his driveway in Luton, England, when he thought he had accidentally driven into one of his flowerbeds. When he got out to inspect the damage to the flowers, he quickly realized that he had been mistaken. He hadn\u2019t driven onto his flower bed at all. Instead, there was a gaping hole in his driveway. \\nEven more unbelievable than the sudden hole that appeared, he also saw that there was a ladder in the hole, where the driveway collapsed. Wanting to know what the odd discovery was all about, he bravely took a look and was shocked to find a two-roomed shelter. Simon Marks next to the air raid shelter (Source: The Sun ) \\n\u201cThis massive hole appeared. I thought it was a sinkhole or a badly constructed garden,\u201d Simon explained, according to The Sun . \u201cI was just terrified the whole house was going to vanish. I took some pictures and sent them to my dad. When I moved a few of the slabs out of the way, I found a ladder. I got my selfie stick and put it down the hole where I saw two rooms.\u201d \\nWhen his dad Gerald saw the pictures, he instantly knew what it was \u2013 an air raid shelter. After looking on the internet for some more information, Simon and his father learned that there were quite a few of these bomb shelters in the area and that this particular one had probably been built after a German bomb landed nearby during World War II. Bottles and newspapers were found inside \\n\u201cThe previous owner must have known it was there, and when he built the house and put a garden in, he must have filled it in,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe clearly wasn\u2019t very worried about it and it just sat there until the hatch fell through. I think it\u2019s great and I want to clear it out and preserve it if it\u2019s structurally sound.\u201d \\nThe shelter is nearly 10 feet deep and was full of mud. As Simon and Gerald began excavating the shelter with buckets, they found various items along with glass bottles and old newspapers. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to think it has all been made by hand,\u201d Simon admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our history so it should be kept.\u201d \\nThis just goes to prove that you never know when you\u2019ll accidentally stumble on a piece of history hidden in your own backyard or your driveway. I can guarantee that Simon had no idea that his property held a treasure of the past \u2013 so you never know what you might stumble on someday and what it could reveal about the history in your area.'"}, "time": 1742561778.9320776}
