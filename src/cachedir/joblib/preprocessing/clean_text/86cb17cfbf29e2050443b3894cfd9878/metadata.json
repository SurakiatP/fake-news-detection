We had this conversation yesterday. So let me ask you now \u2014   now, we have had a leader who\u2019s repeatedly demeaned women, wants to defund organizations that benefit woman, calling on the media to shut up, specifically wants to give preferential treatment based on religion, are these values really much different than the Taliban\u2019s?\u201d When asked if she was talking about Trump\u2019s values, Goldberg continued, \u201cWell no, the values that we are listening to. One of the things that you read yesterday was the piece of the  \u2026    the language in the ban, which was about if you disrespect women. So yesterday I was thinking about this. All of these things that I have been hearing, have our values changed? What\u2019s happened? Are we still fighting  \u2014   She continued, \u201cI feel like, listen, if you\u2019re saying to the media shut up  \u2014   that\u2019s what they do. Maybe they didn\u2019t start out chopping people\u2019s heads off, maybe they started out differently. I\u2019m asking. It, it feels like it\u2019s tricky. Because we\u2019re saying to people, here are our American values, and then we\u2019re saying on the same token stuff that sounds exactly like the stuff we\u2019re fighting. \u201d She concluded, \u201cThat brings me back to this question, it brings me back to the question. So the question is, when you put some of these things side by side \u2014  what kind of religion you\u2019re supposed to have, you\u2019re supposed to have one religion  \u2026    When he says there\u2019s preferential treatment for Christians, forgetting the other religions out there  \u2026    You know here\u2019s the thing, we have a Constitution that says these are the things that we don\u2019t do. This is what makes us different from everybody else. Our media, nobody tells our media to shut up and just take it. Nobody. That\u2019s not American. That is the Taliban  \u2026    My question is, what\u2019s happening?\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562078.6048453}
