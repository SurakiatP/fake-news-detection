United States District Court, upheld Airbnb\u2019s arbitration clause.\\nThe case addressed the issue of whether Airbnb\u2019s sign-up procedure sufficiently notifies its users of the terms and conditions of membership, specifically the organization\u2019s dispute resolution process. What this means, for those renting out space or those renting a room in a person\u2019s home, is if a dispute arises the traditional court system will not be available for resolution. A third-party arbitration panel will provide redress.\\nThe Airbnb arbitration clause was brought into question by Gregory Selden when he filed a lawsuit claiming he was discriminated against by renters, due to his race. Selden, an African-American from Virginia, was planning a trip to Philadelphia. He was familiar with the potential savings offered by Airbnb\u2019s services and began looking for a place to stay. Selden found a location that suited his needs and was available for the dates of his trip. He sent a request for the room but received a message from the renters indicating the room was not available.\\n\\nWhat Selden did next is rather interesting. He felt that he was denied the room based on his race, so he decided to create false profiles on Airbnb showing white people as the rental seekers. Their names were \u201cTodd\u201d and \u201cJesse.\u201d After creating the profiles, he sent a request for the same room and the same dates. Then, he received a response confirming the reservation.\\nSelden filed his lawsuit in May, accusing Airbnb of \u201cfacilitating racial discrimination.\u201d He based his claim, which eventually turned into an effort to create a class action lawsuit against Airbnb, on Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title II, \u201cprohibits discrimination because of race, color, religion, or national origin in certain places of public accommodation, such as hotels, restaurants, and places of entertainment.\u201d Selden argued that in cases addressing issues, like those found under Title II, alternative dispute resolution clauses. such as the one found in Airbnb\u2019s sign-up procedure, should not be enforced.\\nJudge Cooper, also African-American, rejected the argument that \u201cfederal civil rights are not subject to arbitration\u2026\u201d Cooper held that the dispute resolution clause applied to all disputes, even those based on race. He wrote that \u201cMutual arbitration provisions in electronic contracts \u2026 are enforceable, in commercial disputes and discrimination cases alike.\u201d The question of whether Selden knew he was going to be held to an arbitration process came under scrutiny. The judge said that when agreeing to the terms and conditions of a service based organization, such as Airbnb, one ought to assume some type of dispute process will be included. The judge also noted that Airbnb\u2019s notice is sufficiently clear.\\nCooper explained that \u201cFederal policy dictates that doubts about the applicability of an arbitration agreement should be resolved in favor of arbitration.\u201d These types of clauses are not well understood by the majority of people and are often criticized. This has not affected the increase in their usage nor the protection provided to them by the Supreme Court under the Federal Arbitration Act.\\nThe decision made by Judge Cooper to uphold Airbnb\u2019s arbitration clause reflects that contracts, which include alternative dispute resolution provisions, are not unconscionable. This case addresses two issues of particular concern to many in the U.S., which are binding arbitration clauses and racial discrimination. Cooper did provide, in his decision, what he believed to be an appropriate course of action for those seeking a change to such contractual agreements. He said that while his court was not the correct venue to address these concerns, \u201cSuch objections should be taken up with the appropriate regulators or with Congress.\u201d\\nBy Joel Wickwire\\nEdited by Jeanette Smith\\nSources:\\nBloomberg Law: Airbnb Arbitration Policy Blocks Guest\u2019s Race Discrimination Suit\\nInsurance Journal: Federal Judge Upholds Airbnb Arbitration Clause in Racial Bias Case\\nThe New Yorker: How Airbnb Makes It Hard to Sue for Discrimination\\nTop and Feature Images Courtesy of Open Grid Scheduler\u2019s Flickr Page \u2013 Creative Commons License\\nIn-Line Image Courtesy of Beth Cortez-Neavel\u2019s Flickr Page \u2013 Creative Commons License    arbitration'"}, "time": 1742628408.261143}
