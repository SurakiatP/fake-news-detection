Comcast, News Corp., Disney, Viacom, CBS and Time Warner dominate US broadcast and cable television news, entertainment and sports, movie and TV production, theme parks, record labels, publishing, and for-profit online operations. On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported telecommunications giant AT&T and Time Warner agreeing to merge. Approval, if granted, would likely assure greater consolidation in both industries \u2013 benefitting corporate predators at the expense of the vast majority of consumers, giving them less choice than already, ensuring higher prices for poorer service. Hillary is a Wall Street, war profiteers, corporate predators tool, virtually certain to support this outrageous deal \u2013 likely to get FCC and Justice Department approval on her watch. Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Trump called the proposed deal another example of too few sources disseminating information to Americans, warning of \u201ctoo much concentration of power,\u201d manipulating people, telling them how to think. As president, if elected, he vowed to oppose it. He\u2019s against jobs-killing TPP, NAFTA and similar deals. \u201cOur jobs are fleeing the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to Mexico. They\u2019re going to many other countries.\u201d Hillary calls TPP the \u201cgold standard in trade agreements,\u201d sure to approve what Trump opposes. He calls friendly relations with Russia a good thing, praising Putin as \u201ca leader\u2026far more than our president has been,\u201d saying \u201c(i)f we have a (normal) relationship with Russia, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we could work together on it and knock the hell out of ISIS.\u201d Hillary\u2019s rage for endless wars to eliminate all sovereign independent governments risks nuclear confrontation with Russia, China and Iran on her watch. Trump is no peacenik, no paragon of virtue, yet he\u2019s on the right side of vital issues discussed above. Hillary should terrify everyone \u2013 on the wrong side of virtually everything mattering most, the most ruthlessly dangerous choice for president in US history.
