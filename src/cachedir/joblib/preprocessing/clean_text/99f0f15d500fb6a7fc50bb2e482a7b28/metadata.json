This past Saturday, November 2, 2013 West Point Military Academy\u2019s Cadet Chapel hosted the first ever male same-sex marriage ceremony . This follows two female same-sex marriages late in 2012. \\nNeedless to say, somebody at the academy has decided to join the 21st Century and not a moment too soon; gay marriage was made legal in New York State way back in mid-2011 . Still, long time coming aside, it was a huge day for West Point graduates 28-year-old Larry Choate III (Class of 2009), and 27-year-old Daniel Lennox (Class of 2007), and we at Liberal America sent our congratulations. \\nSadly, however, there is still a raging debate on gay marriage and whether or not it should be made legal courtesy of the Big G, (U.S. Federal Government). Fifty two percent of Americans say yes according to a Gallup poll conducted this past July, and we already know what we, here at The Liberal Conservative , think about federal laws on not just gay marriage but marriage in general \u2013 spoiler alert: we\u2019re for gay marriage, just not via federal law. \\nNow the thing that the far-right, Tea Party-indoctrinated \u201cRepublicans,\u201d have to realize is that there is a certain group of people to which they have fallen behind on this matter, and many others. This is a group of people that they should be ashamed and embarrassed to have fallen behind. This is a group of people who have proven to be more mature, more merciful, kinder, and warmer than they are. \\nChildren . \\nIf you\u2019ve ever checked out any of the ?Kids React To\u2026? videos on YouTube such as the one above or this one or \u2013 more importantly \u2013 this one , then you\u2019re familiar with the work of The Fine Brothers , Benny and Rafi. They\u2019ve been at this for a while now and, as The Daily Dot explains, when they\u2019re not getting kids\u2019 reactions to things like, Nyan Cat, Justin Bieber, or Rebecca Black, they have their delightful cast of youngsters tackling issues like race relations, rape culture, bullying, and, yes, ?gay marriage. \\nThirteen children were asked to react to videos of same-sex marriage proposals and offer their opinion. With the exception of a single young boy, the children reacted universally positive; and then with anger when they inevitably discover that not everybody is allowed to marry who they love in the United States \u2013 the \u201cfreest\u201d nation on Earth. \\nTo the proposals themselves the kids, Californians aged 5 to 13 years, were floored by the displays of love they were fortunate to witness in the videos. And when he discovered the truth about gay marriage in America young Dylan wondered: \\nWhy would you be that mean to someone? \\nIndeed. Why would we be that mean to someone? \\nSomeone in the audience yells \u201cReligion!\u201d and I roll my eyes in disappointed concurrence. \\nThis author\u2019s personal favorite reaction comes from 5-year-old Lucas who, apart from looking gloriously like Zachary Quinto as Spock, turns to one of the Fines after the first video and asks \u201cSo, they\u2019re gay?\u201d When this is confirmed he simply lets out a nonchalant and confirming, \u201cOh.\u201d Standing against gay marriage is..illogical.'"}, "time": 1742628316.4923656}
