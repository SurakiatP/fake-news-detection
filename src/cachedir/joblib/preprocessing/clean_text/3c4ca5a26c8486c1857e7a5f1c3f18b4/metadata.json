[Abu Baker Almaqdesi, a top Palestinian jihadi who previously fought for IS in Syria and Iraq and returned to his native Gaza following an injury, said that hundreds of rockets and explosive belts have been seized by Hamas in a recent raid.  Last month, Hamas unveiled a jihadi arsenal containing some 250 rockets and hundreds of   rifles. \u201cThe range of some of these rockets is 140 kilometers,\u201d Almaqdesi claimed without providing any evidence.  He further stated that similar rockets have already been shipped to Waliyat Sinai, IS\u2019s Egyptian affiliate. A Hamas Interior Ministry official declined to confirm or deny the report about the rocket workshop, but confirmed that electronic devices allegedly utilized to connect between   jihadists and their Gaza counterparts have been seized. On Saturday, two rockets were fired from Gaza into southern Israel, prompting the Israel Defense Forces to retaliate against Hamas positions. Meanwhile, the   Aamaq news agency reported that Israeli drones raided the organization\u2019s strongholds in Sinai. \u201cSeveral people, including two children, were killed and (others) injured on Thursday in Israeli raids on outposts in Rafah and Sheikh Zwaid in the north of Sinai,\u201d the report said.'"}, "time": 1742563538.2981157}
