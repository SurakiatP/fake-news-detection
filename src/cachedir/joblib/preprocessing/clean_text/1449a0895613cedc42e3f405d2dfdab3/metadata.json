Sonny Perdue of Georgia stepped off the elevator on the 26th floor of Trump Tower last week for his interview with Donald J. Trump, he expected a grilling by the   and a phalanx of associates, something along the lines of the confrontational boardroom scenes at the sleek conference table in the television show \u201cThe Apprentice. \u201d What he found instead was Mr. Trump, calm and solicitous behind a desk cluttered with papers and periodicals, in a large corner office with a hodgepodge of memorabilia and d\u00e9cor that appeared little changed from the 1980s. Nick Ayers, an aide to Vice   Mike Pence, and Stephen K. Bannon, who will serve as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, listened from the sidelines. Mr. Trump, who offered Mr. Perdue a seat across from his desk, was in charge. \u201cHe was approaching this from a deal standpoint, and he wanted to know if he was on the right track,\u201d said Mr. Perdue, who is being considered for secretary of agriculture and wore a tie adorned with tractors to the meeting. \u201cHe believes that we in the United States have been sort of patsies over the years in the way we\u2019ve dealt with our foreign competitors and international trade  \u2014   and I agree with him  \u2014   and he wanted to know what I would do about it. \u201d For more than a decade, millions of Americans tuned in to watch Mr. Trump interrogate prospective employees on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with a mix of arrogance and disdain. But in private over the past few weeks, a less theatrical spinoff of the spectacle has unfolded in Mr. Trump\u2019s office in Manhattan, and occasionally at his golf resort in Bedminster, N. J. or at    his getaway in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Trump\u2019s interview style in the real world is direct but conversational, according to people who have sat opposite him. He did not take notes or appear to refer to a set list of questions, but he did have dossiers on his visitors and often displayed intricate knowledge of their backgrounds and experience. He rarely drank or ate. He kept his suit jacket on. In New York, he liked to show off the sweeping views of Central Park visible over his shoulder. Job seekers, who must parade before the news media in the marble and bronze lobby of Trump Tower  \u2014   \u201cIt was almost like walking the red carpet in Hollywood,\u201d said Representative Lou Barletta, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has offered himself up as a secretary of transportation or labor  \u2014   said that the   often asked   questions and had little patience for meandering answers. \u201cIf you filibuster, he\u2019ll cut you off,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who was initially in the running to be Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state but has since said he is not interested in a cabinet post. \u201cHe wants to know what you can do for him. \u201d Mr. Gingrich said Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to putting together his administration was the same one he has used with his   business. \u201cHe\u2019s used to defining jobs, measuring capability and making a judgment: \u2018Do I think you can run my golf course? Do I think you can run my hotel? Do I want your restaurant in my building? \u2019\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. Mr. Trump has been more   in the interviews than his predecessors were. George W. Bush rarely spoke in person to more than one finalist for each cabinet post, said Clay Johnson III, who directed his transition effort in 2000. President Obama also interviewed a single finalist for each post in most cases, usually in a    discussion meant to confirm an already   conclusion that the candidate would be right for the job, said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior transition official in 2008. \u201cIn some cases, he knew who he wanted and it was a question of convincing them to do it,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said, citing examples like Hillary Clinton, who became Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of state, and Robert M. Gates, whom he persuaded to stay on as defense secretary. Mr. Obama was also adamant that the deliberations not spill out into the open, but that has not been the case with Mr. Trump. Members of Congress, generals, business executives and others mingle outside his office, waiting for an audience with the  . Mr. Barletta waited more than 45 minutes for his meeting, passing the time chatting with his Republican colleague Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, who was waiting for his turn to audition for secretary of homeland security. \u201cIt was like a green room, a waiting room of people you know or you know of, all waiting their turn,\u201d said Robert L. Johnson, the founder of the television network BET, who visited Mr. Trump at Bedminster to discuss ways the incoming president could reach out to  . As Mr. Johnson was coming in, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York whom Mr. Trump is considering for secretary of state, was going out. Mr. Trump wants a gut sense for a potential hire, people close to him said, prizing personal chemistry and an entrepreneurial spirit. But he also leans on the judgment of trusted advisers  \u2014   particularly Mr. Pence and his elder daughter, Ivanka Trump  \u2014   when assessing a candidate. It was Ms. Trump who reached out to Mr. Johnson, the businessman and BET founder, after she saw a statement he issued the week after her father\u2019s victory. In it, Mr. Johnson urged black voters to participate in elections and insist that both political parties address their concerns in order to earn their support. Days later, Mr. Johnson was being led into a room at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster to meet with Mr. Trump, along with Reince Priebus, whom Mr. Trump has named chief of staff, Mr. Bannon and Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner. Mr. Trump asked what jobs he might consider taking in the administration, but Mr. Johnson said he quickly made it known he was not seeking a post. \u201cI told him as we sat down in the room that, \u2018  Trump, you shouldn\u2019t ask   voters what they have to lose, as you did in your campaign what you should have said, and what you should be talking about now is, this is what you have to gain from a Trump administration,\u2019\u201d Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Trump seemed to take the advice. He said, \u201c \u2018So I should focus on the aspirational aspects,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Trump has taken advice from other job seekers as well. During his interview with James N. Mattis, who was selected last week to be the secretary of defense, Mr. Trump questioned the retired general about whether torture works as a tool for extracting vital information from terrorism suspects. General Mattis told him it did not, a view Mr. Trump later said surprised him and gave him reason to reconsider his position on the matter. Mr. Trump, who prizes loyalty, also wanted to know precisely what the job seekers did to propel him into the White House. \u201cHe asked about what I had done to help in Georgia,\u201d said Mr. Perdue, who told the   that he and his cousin, Senator David Perdue, had repeatedly reassured campaign officials about Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects there and encouraged them to focus their energies elsewhere. Scott Brown, a former Massachusetts senator who met with Mr. Trump last month about becoming his secretary of veterans affairs, said that Mr. Trump asked how he could help him deliver on his campaign pledges and how to ensure a \u201cgood value\u201d for veterans receiving services from the agency or private contractors. \u201cHe made it clear that he\u2019s a businessman and he\u2019s going to delegate to people like me, potentially, and others,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to say, \u2018Do your job, and do it well, and otherwise  \u2014   you\u2019re fired. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628403.3627796}
