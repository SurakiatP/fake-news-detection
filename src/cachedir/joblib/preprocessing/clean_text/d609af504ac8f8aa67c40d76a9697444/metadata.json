At this point, however, it remains to be seen whether these emails are significant to the FBI\u2019s investigation into Clinton. It is also not known how many relevant emails there are. \\nThis is a major problem for the surrogates, lawyers, life-long friends, and defenders of the status quo as it destroys the narrative that has been painted suggesting these emails found on Weiner\u2019s laptop are merely backups of what law enforcement officials have already seen (and found no intent in). But what is most intriguing is the question of whether the missing 33,000 \u2018personal\u2019 emails \u2018deleted\u2019 by Bryan Pagliano in the full knowledge of Hillary Clinton (according to Wikileaks emails), are also on the estranged husband of Clinton right-hand-lady Huma Abedin\u2019s laptop. \\ns Federal law enforcement officials concluded to CBS News tonight : \u201cThese emails have never been seen before\u201d \\nFox\u2019s Bret Baier summed up what happens next\u2026 \u201cI pressed again and again on this very issue\u2026 The investigations will continue, there is a lot of evidence. And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they will continue to likely an indictment .\u201d \\nThis article originally appeared on ZeroHedge.'"}, "time": 1742562868.4593997}
