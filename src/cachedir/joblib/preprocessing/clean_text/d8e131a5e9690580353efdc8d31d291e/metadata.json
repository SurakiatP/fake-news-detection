Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, climbed into the cockpit of a   robot and began flailing his arms as though warming up for a workout, causing the robot\u2019s enormous appendages to mimic his movements. \u201cWhy do I feel so much like Sigourney Weaver?\u201d Mr. Bezos said, referring to the actress who wore a mechanical suit in a climactic battle in the 1986 movie \u201cAliens. \u201d The intimate audience of entrepreneurs and academics, attending an Amazon conference on robotics and artificial intelligence, chuckled. Later, Mr. Bezos posted a photo on Twitter of himself in the suit with a more menacing air, the robot\u2019s arms raised as if about to deliver a   bear hug. For years, retailers have been haunted by the thought of Amazon using its technological prowess to squeeze them into powder. That battle has mostly played out on Amazon\u2019s home turf, the world of online shopping. Now the fight is coming directly to retailers on actual streets around the globe, where Amazon is slowly building a fleet of physical stores. And while most of the attention has been focused on Amazon\u2019s grocery store dreams, the company has a more ambitious collection of experiments underway. If those experiments work  \u2014   and there is no guarantee of that  \u2014   they could have a profound influence on how other stores operate. Over time, they could also introduce new forms of automation, putting traditional retail jobs in jeopardy. At the same time, locating those stores close to customers\u2019 homes could also help Amazon further its ambitions of delivering internet orders within hours. The company is exploring the idea of creating stores to sell furniture and home appliances, like refrigerators  \u2014   the kinds of products that shoppers are reluctant to buy over the internet sight unseen, said one of several people with knowledge of the discussions who, in conversations with The New York Times, spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential. The stores would serve as showcases where people could view the items in person, with orders being delivered to their homes. These would not be your average Home Depots: Amazon has considered using forms of augmented or virtual reality to allow people to see how couches, stoves and credenzas will look in their homes, the person briefed on the discussions said. Amazon is also kicking around an   concept similar to Apple\u2019s retail emporiums, according to two of the people familiar with the discussions. These shops would have a heavy emphasis on Amazon devices and services such as the company\u2019s Echo smart home speaker and Prime Video streaming service. And in groceries  \u2014   a giant category in which Amazon has struggled  \u2014   the company has opened a convenience store that does not need cashiers, and it is close to opening two stores where drivers can quickly pick up groceries without leaving their cars, all in Seattle. It has explored another grocery store concept that could serve   customers and act as a hub for home deliveries. Overseas, Amazon is quietly targeting India for new    grocery stores. It is a vast market, and one still largely dominated by traditional street bazaars where shoppers must wander from stall to stall haggling over prices and deliberating over unrefrigerated meat sitting in the dusty open air. Amazon\u2019s internal code name for its India grocery ambitions: Project Everest. Last week, Amazon opened its fifth physical book store in Chicago, and it has five more announced locations under construction. It is possible that some of the store ideas will never see the light of day. Groups within Amazon are often encouraged to come up with zany initiatives (this is the company that popularized the idea of drone deliveries). Many ideas are chucked after deeper scrutiny by executives. Amazon declined to talk about any stores it has not announced publicly. \u201cWe are always thinking about new ways to serve customers, but thinking is different than planning,\u201d said Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman. Since the late \u201990s, pundits have asked when Amazon  \u2014   the company Mr. Bezos founded on the premise that people would rather shop from the comfort of their screens  \u2014   would finally start building stores. But Amazon executives saw plenty of opportunities in online retail and new ways to reach people, from creating digital   devices like Kindle to building up the Prime membership service for getting faster deliveries and other benefits. In 2012, Mr. Bezos told the television interviewer Charlie Rose that shoppers were already well served by existing retailers and that Amazon had no interest in a   effort. \u201cWe want to do something uniquely Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can find that idea, and we haven\u2019t found it yet, but if we can find that idea, we would love to open physical stores. \u201d Despite Amazon\u2019s internet retailing success, over time it has become clear that there is a lot of shopping that people prefer to do in person. The most glaring example is groceries  \u2014   the mother of all shopping categories, with about $770 billion for the supermarkets represented by the Food Marketing Institute, a nonprofit group that includes the majority of such stores in the United States. After pouring resources into an online grocery service, AmazonFresh, for almost a decade, the company has made only modest progress. According to people familiar with the workings of the company\u2019s grocery business, it has struggled to operate it profitably, leading to a slow rollout of the service in new locations. One big desire many customers have is that they want to see fresh fruits, vegetables and meat in person before buying them. The relatively high cost of home delivery  \u2014   Amazon charges $15 a month for its Fresh service, on top of a $99 annual Prime membership  \u2014   is another barrier. Online grocery delivery accounts for only about 3 percent of the market in the United States, though it is closer to 10 percent in Britain, said Randy Burt, a partner in the food and beverage practice of A. T. Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm. Mr. Burt said Amazon\u2019s growing interest in stores mirrored the conclusion that other online merchants with physical stores  \u2014   the apparel seller Bonobos and the eyewear seller Warby Parker  \u2014   had come to. \u201cI think they are recognizing, for certain things you can\u2019t digitize and replicate online all the experience one has in a store,\u201d Mr. Burt said. \u201cThe ability to create experiences is going to be critical for them to continue to get share. \u201d Joe Thompson, a former general manager in Amazon\u2019s retail business, sees physical retail as key to Mr. Bezos\u2019s outsize ambitions for the company. \u201dI can\u2019t help but feel that, in Bezos\u2019s mind, he wants to be the first   valuation company,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, who is now an executive at BuildDirect, an online home improvement store. To do that, he said, Amazon would have to \u201ccrack\u201d a couple of \u201ccompletely underpenetrated markets online. \u201d Amazon\u2019s current market value is bobbing around $400 billion. In the coming weeks, Amazon is expected to open its first two grocery pickup stores, in Seattle\u2019s Ballard and SoDo neighborhoods, which will allow customers to order food online and schedule brief windows for picking them up in person. Recently, as cars ripped by, workers hung a sign on the exterior of one of the stores  \u2014   to be called AmazonFresh Pickup, according to city permit documents obtained by GeekWire  \u2014   before quickly covering it up. A growing number of established grocery retailers are experimenting with this \u201cclick and collect\u201d approach to shopping, including Walmart, Kroger and others. According to one person briefed on Amazon\u2019s plans, the company has been developing technology for automatically detecting when a customer pulls into the parking lot so orders can be brought to them more quickly. A few miles away from its other Seattle stores, on the ground floor of one of its many office towers in the city, the company is testing Amazon Go, a convenience store concept stocked with beverages, sandwiches and prepared meals, which are put together by chefs in a kitchen that is visible from the street. The retail industry has been captivated by Amazon Go\u2019s technology since the company unveiled the store late last year. The store uses a combination of sensors and artificial intelligence to automatically detect the food items shoppers remove from shelves, so they can leave the store without visiting a cashier  \u2014   the way customers do when they bolt from an Uber. \u201cAmazon is wonderful at frictionless commerce,\u201d said Timothy Laseter, a professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business. There have been glitches with the technology that Amazon engineers continue to work on, according to a person familiar with the operations. For now, only Amazon employees are allowed to use the store. Amazon previously said it would open Amazon Go to the public in early 2017. If Amazon is successful at automating the checkout process, the   implications for employment could be   because other retailers would probably do everything possible to copy it. More than 3. 4 million people are employed as cashiers in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Amazon Go technologies like artificial intelligence are \u201cLatin for \u2018fire cashiers,\u2019\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Leonard N. Stern School of Business. \u201cI\u2019ve probably been in 30 boardrooms of retailers in the past year,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cI would say the No. 1 topic of conversation is Amazon. \u201d For months, reports have circulated that Amazon was considering a concept for a larger grocery store that would combine shopping formats like traditional   purchases,    and home delivery. One of those articles, a February piece by The New York Post, described a futuristic Amazon grocery store staffed by robots, requiring only three human workers. That was too much, apparently, for Mr. Bezos, who became uncharacteristically feisty on Twitter, attacking the article by saying The Post\u2019s sources had \u201cmixed up their meds. \u201d But a group within Amazon has explored another larger grocery store format, according to both a person familiar with the concept and to internal Amazon documents reviewed by The New York Times. The store could stock fresh produce, meats and other items in a public area of the store, while keeping frozen foods, cereals and other items traditionally found in the center of a grocery store behind a wall, in what would be a kind of small Amazon warehouse. Workers behind the wall, not robots, could quickly package orders for customers. The idea resembles a concept laid out in a paper, \u201cA Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths,\u201d written by the retail industry consultant Brittain Ladd, who was later hired by Amazon. The status of that project at Amazon is unclear: One person said it never advanced far and was effectively dead, and another disputed that characterization. While Mr. Bezos was known for coining the motto \u201cGet Big Fast\u201d in the early days of Amazon, the company\u2019s plans in physical retail could be better described as \u201cGet Big Slow. \u201d Some reports have said Amazon has discussed building up to 2, 000 grocery stores. But that figure was floated mainly as a hypothetical to consider the impact on Amazon\u2019s supply chain, not as a goal that was under serious consideration, a person familiar with the discussions said. In addition to the two soon to open in Seattle, as many as five more AmazonFresh Pickup locations could open by next year, and the company hopes to expand Amazon Go to Britain and several cities in the United States in the same time frame, this person said. India could represent another big market for Amazon in physical retail. The company, which has vowed to spend billions of dollars on its efforts in the world\u2019s   populous country, recently sought approval from the Indian government to open online and physical food stores in the country, The Economic Times reported in February. According to a person familiar with Amazon\u2019s India grocery efforts, the company hopes to open its first Indian grocery store in Bangalore. In a statement, Amazon said the company was excited by the Indian government\u2019s efforts to encourage foreign investment in a \u201cstronger food supply chain. \u201d \u201cWe have sought an approval to invest and partner with the government in achieving this vision,\u201d Amazon said. For Mr. Galloway at N. Y. U. the slow pace of Amazon\u2019s rollout of stores is a sign that it has not figured out physical retail yet, and that has surprised him. Five years ago, he believed Amazon would have hundreds of stores by this time. \u201cWhat appears to be clear is they haven\u2019t yet zeroed in on a format they\u2019re willing to massively scale,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a company that the moment it figures out something that works, it puts nuclear energy behind it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562404.100419}
