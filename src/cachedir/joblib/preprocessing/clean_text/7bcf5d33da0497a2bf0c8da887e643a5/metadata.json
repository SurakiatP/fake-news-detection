Mr. King spoke during a panel discussion, led by the MSNBC host Chris Hayes, about the racial makeup of the Republican Party on the first day of the party\u2019s convention. \u201cIf you\u2019re really optimistic, you can say this was the last time that old white people would command the Republican Party\u2019s attention, its platform, its public face,\u201d Charles P. Pierce, a writer at large at Esquire magazine, said during the panel discussion. In response, Mr. King said: \u201cThis whole \u2018old white people\u2019 business does get a little tired, Charlie. I\u2019d ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you are talking about? Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?\u201d \u201cThan white people?\u201d Mr. Hayes asked. Mr. King responded: \u201cThan Western civilization itself that\u2019s rooted in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the United States of America, and every place where the footprint of Christianity settled the world. That\u2019s all of Western civilization. \u201d Frantic yelling ensued, with the panelists speaking over one another. \u201cWhat about Africa? What about Asia?\u201d April Ryan, a reporter on the panel, said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to argue the history of civilization,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. \u201cLet me note for the record that if you\u2019re looking at the ledger of Western civilization, for every flourishing democracy you\u2019ve got Hitler and Stalin as well. So there\u2019s a lot on both sides. \u201d Some Twitter users said Mr. Hayes should have allowed a response instead of going to a commercial break, and he said on Twitter that they might have a point. Mr. King, who was first elected to Congress in 2002, did not immediately return a message seeking comment. In 2013, he attracted criticism after saying that for every child of illegal immigrants \u201cwho\u2019s a valedictorian, there\u2019s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. \u201d In June, he moved to block an effort to put Harriet Tubman, the abolitionist, on the $20 bill. On Twitter, Ms. Ryan called Mr. King \u201cmentally stunted\u201d and said she had wanted to respond but had not been able to get her word in. \u201cSteve King you need to learn about race and contributions by other societies in this country,\u201d she tweeted. Other Twitter users quickly attacked Mr. King for the comments.'"}, "time": 1742628545.366911}
