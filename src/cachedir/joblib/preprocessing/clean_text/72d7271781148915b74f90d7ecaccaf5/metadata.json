[Comey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administration\u2019s statements about the matter \u201cconfused me and increasingly concerned me. \u201d He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay.  \u201cI was extremely   by the FBI workforce,\u201d Comey said. \u201cSo it confused me when I saw on television the president saying that he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation. \u201d Under questioning, Comey would later admit that the president did not ask him to stop the Russia investigation, an admission already contained in Comey\u2019s prepared written testimony. Comey continued: \u201cI was also confused by the initial explanation that was offered publicly: that I was fired because of the decisions I had made during the election year. \u201d He had assumed that was \u201cwater   \u2026     under the bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe administration then chose to defame me, and more importantly the FBI, by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple, and I am so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them, and I\u2019m so sorry that the American people were told them. \u201d Comey closed his remarks by offering words of praise for his former colleagues at the FBI. But his remarks left little doubt that his motivations for testifying were deeply personal. And they created an impression that he intended to exact a political price from the president for doing what he acknowledged the president had every right to do. Joel B.
