To guide you through this final, delirious phase of the presidential campaign, The New York Times is drawing on our   team of reporters, columnists, magazine writers and analysts to create a new podcast. It\u2019s called The  . I will be your host. I\u2019ve covered every twist and turn of the last two presidential campaigns for The Times  \u2014   from Mitt Romney\u2019s infamous \u201c47 percent\u201d remark to Barack Obama\u2019s sudden shift on gay marriage, Marco Rubio\u2019s debate night meltdown to Hillary Clinton\u2019s inability to build trust. (Before that, I covered Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s City Hall, and that other cutthroat business: the American retailing industry.) Twice a week on The   my colleagues and I will make sense of a campaign that has baffled, shocked and reordered the political world. We\u2019ll also bring you interviews with some of the election\u2019s most influential figures. You\u2019ll be able to listen to a new episode of The   each Tuesday and Friday on the digital platforms of The New York Times, as well as on iTunes, Google Play Music, Stitcher or the podcast app of your choice. If you have never listened to a podcast before, scroll down for some assistance. For our first episode, we explore whether Hillary Clinton, the most distrusted Democratic presidential nominee in a generation, is heading for an   legitimate landslide  \u2014   and if she is, or if she comes close, what that would mean for the future of both parties. Our guests: Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House Amy Chozick, who covers Mrs. Clinton for The Times and Nate Cohn, a data whiz from The Upshot. A teaser from the Gingrich conversation about Trump: Take a listen, and let us know what you think. You can reach us at therunup@nytimes. com, or find me on Twitter.
