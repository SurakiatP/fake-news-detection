[Cohn said that overhauling the tax code is one of the top priorities for the Trump administration in 2017, claiming specifically that they have spent an \u201cenormous amount\u201d of time discussing the topic.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s August or not,\u201d Cohn said in an interview Friday morning on Bloomberg TV. \u201cGetting it done well and getting it done right is more important than getting it done soon. \u201d Cohn, who serves at the head of the National Economic Council, claims that Congress will work on putting together \u201cone cohesive\u201d tax plan when it returns from recess in  . Trump\u2019s aides have insisted that, unlike the failed effort to repeal Obamacare, the tax code rewrite will be driven by the White House.
