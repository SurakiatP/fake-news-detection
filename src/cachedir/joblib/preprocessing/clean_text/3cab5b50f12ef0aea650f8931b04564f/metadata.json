A final decision whether to cancel the season will be made in the next few days, John D. Cramer, a university spokesman, said in an interview. The suspension came after an anonymous complaint made this week alerted officials to \u201cseveral materials\u201d that were offensive, including in electronic correspondence, the university said in a statement. Mr. Cramer would not discuss specifics of the other materials, including their content or when they were created, but confirmed that the comments were made about members of the women\u2019s swimming and diving team. The suspension was the third of an Ivy League team since the start of November. Last month, Columbia and Harvard each suspended the season of a team after allegations of lewd behavior surfaced. Harvard canceled the rest of the season for its men\u2019s soccer team after officials uncovered what they described as a widespread practice of players rating the school\u2019s female players in sexually explicit terms. The Columbia wrestling team\u2019s season was suspended while officials said they were investigating text messages sent by players that included the frequent use of racist, misogynistic and homophobic terms. At Princeton, the swimming and diving team, which has 38 members, was scheduled to compete on Jan. 7 against Navy and on Feb. 5 against Harvard and Yale. The Ivy League Championships will be Feb.  . \u201cThe behavior that we have learned about is simply unacceptable,\u201d Mollie Marcoux Samaan, Princeton\u2019s director of athletics, said in a statement. \u201cIt is antithetical to the values of our athletic program and of the university and will not be tolerated. \u201d The team was notified about the suspension on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cramer said. \u201cI am deeply disappointed by the behavior of the men\u2019s swim team,\u201d Christopher L. Eisgruber, the university\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cI have asked the athletic department to redouble its efforts to ensure that our teams conduct themselves with the character and ethics that we expect from students representing Princeton University in athletic competition. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563361.751221}
