Trump to the battleground states that could decide an election just over 100 days away. Two weeks of speeches, music, infighting and ultimately mountains of balloons and confetti for Democrats and Republicans have cemented the terms of the debate and left both parties as unified as they can be. Now comes the grueling homestretch of the campaign, where advertising will step up and the bickering between the candidates is likely to become even more biting. Signaling the importance of Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, stayed in Philadelphia to campaign early Friday, holding a rally at Temple University to begin a   bus tour through Harrisburg and Pittsburgh and then Youngstown and Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Trump made his way west for campaign events in Colorado Springs and Denver. While en route, he lashed out on Twitter at those who were critical of him at the Democratic National Convention, specifically calling out Michael R. Bloomberg, New York\u2019s former mayor, and John R. Allen, a retired   general, as failures. That Pennsylvania, which Democrats have carried in every presidential election since 1992, is in play underscores the threat posed by Mr. Trump, who campaigned on Wednesday in Scranton. The Republican nominee\u2019s appeals to white   voters make him attractive in the Rust Belt and could potentially reshape the election map. Joined by her running mate and a handful of Pennsylvania lawmakers, Mrs. Clinton took stock on Friday of the campaign\u2019s new phase, taking pains to contrast her convention\u2019s sunnier outlook with Mr. Trump\u2019s grim appraisal during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. And her more traditional campaign event was in stark contrast to the withering   attack Mr. Trump delivered against Senator Ted Cruz in which he rehashed old dramas about the Texas senator\u2019s wife and father. \u201cWe might as well have been talking about two different countries,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told a crowd of thousands packed inside a gymnasium. \u201cOr, as someone said to me, two different planets. \u201d Mrs. Clinton said she had been up quite late after her speech on Thursday  \u2014   \u201cIt was just really hard to go to sleep,\u201d she said  \u2014   and joked that she and her husband had asked to have their coffee \u201cadministered through an IV. \u201d \u201cWe suddenly looked at each other and we realized, as of tomorrow, we have 100 days to make our case,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. That meant continuing to depict Mr. Trump as a danger to democracy, a   anathema to the country\u2019s principles. The nation\u2019s founders \u201cknew they didn\u2019t want one person, one man, to have all the power like a king,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, who also made sure to note her family ties to Scranton, where she spent her childhood summers. A Suffolk University poll released this week showed Mrs. Clinton with a nine percentage point lead in Pennsylvania, but she is not taking anything for granted. Democrats hope that hosting their national convention in Philadelphia will give Mrs. Clinton a boost in the state. \u201cI think Democrats will be unified against Donald Trump and in favor of a more hopeful optimistic message for the country,\u201d said Josh Shapiro, the Montgomery County commissioner, who is running to be Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general. \u201cEveryone will be on the same page coming out of Philly this week. \u201d Political analysts will be watching closely in the coming days to see if Mrs. Clinton receives a bounce nationally from the convention, which was well received for its crisp choreography. Mr. Trump overtook her in some polls after last week\u2019s Republican convention. While Democrats generally considered Mrs. Clinton\u2019s acceptance speech on Thursday night to be one of her best, Republicans offered reviews that were more mixed. Many considered it to be a classic liberal speech filled with policies they could never support, but some Republicans who still refuse to support Mr. Trump expressed remorse about the direction of their party and offered some praise for her address. \u201cThere\u2019s a logic to this speech that is in American mainstream,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, a former adviser to Mitt Romney. \u201cTrump was dark and outside mainstream. \u201d Unsurprisingly, the Trump campaign pushed back against Mrs. Clinton\u2019s assertion that Mr. Trump was taking the Republican Party from \u201cmorning in America\u201d to \u201cmidnight in America. \u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s midnight in America, it\u2019s because of the seven and a half years of the Obama and Clinton administration,\u201d Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, said on Fox News on Friday. Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, said at a luncheon in Indianapolis that Mrs. Clinton offered no new ideas. \u201cWhat I heard was more, a commitment to more taxes, more regulation, more government,\u201d he said. \u201cMore of the same failed policies that have landed our national government $19 trillion in debt. \u201d In an interview on the Hugh Hewitt radio program, Mr. Pence lamented the personal attacks leveled by Democrats at Mr. Trump, particularly President Obama labeling him a \u201cdemagogue. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think name calling has any place in public life, and I thought that was unfortunate that the president of the United States would use a term like that,\u201d Mr. Pence said. Mr. Trump was skewered by many of the speakers at the Democratic convention, where his business record, his combative policies and even his sanity were called into question. He clearly took it personally. Doing some   of his own on Friday, he mocked Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s height and claimed that General Allen \u201cfailed badly\u201d in the fight against the Islamic State. And Mr. Trump took issue with the content and tenor of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech, arguing that his opponent envisions a borderless America where workers have no power and no security. And he was not pleased with how she characterized him. \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and \u2018forgot\u2019 to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!\u201d Mr. Trump said. At his rally in Colorado Springs, Mr. Trump said that he thought the Republican convention was the better of the two and that he was disappointed Mrs. Clinton did not at least congratulate him on being nominated. When the adoring crowd began chanting \u201clock her up,\u201d Mr. Trump did not stop them. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying let\u2019s just beat her on Nov. 8, but you know what I\u2019m starting to agree with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m taking the gloves off!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561877.7782335}
