The case gripped the entire world, becoming one of the most high profile missing persons cases in history. Coverage of her kidnapping was comparable to the press interest in the death of Princess Diana.\\nHer parents had been out with friends at the hotel restaurant approximately 200 feet from where the child had been sleeping. When her mother Kate McCann went to check on her around 11 pm, but she was gone.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We go to bed every night with the agonising feeling that just maybe tomorrow we will find something to lead us back to Madeleine. To let us know what happened. To give us hope,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Kate McCann, who is now an ambassador for Missing People, said at the launch of a new nonprofit organization called Find Every Child, in London this week .\\nThough it has been nearly a decade since their little girl vanished, the family has continued the search, and believe that there is a possibility that she may still be alive.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153When my little girl first disappeared, on that horrendous night that changed our lives forever, I could never have imagined that nearly 10 years later we would still be in the same position,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she continued.\\nIn 2013, five years after Portuguese police had closed the case, they reopened it and revealed two new police sketches. It was believed that they were supposed to be of the same man, but from two different witnesses. Reddit and others on social media are now asking, what if it was actually two different men, and what if it was the Podestas?\\nPodesta + brother Tony, +photos of Madeleine McCann\\'s kidnappers, note the mole placement on Tony @wikileaks @DonaldJTrumpJr #spiritcooking pic.twitter.com/miRcNJKDTF \\n\u2014 Marqui Robbins (@MarquiRobbins) November 7, 2016 \\n\\nAwkward!
