Trump on Friday sought to project support from   for his campaign on a single man in the audience. Mr. Trump, at a rally here, began speaking about a previous rally in Arizona in which a black supporter was arrested after punching a protester. \u201cWe had a case where we had an   guy who is a fan of mine,\u201d Mr. Trump said of an event in Arizona in March. \u201cIn fact I want to find out what\u2019s going on with him. \u201d As his voice trailed off, Mr. Trump noticed a man in the crowd. \u201cOh look at my   over here,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAre you the greatest? Do you know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d Mr. Trump then returned to speaking about the Arizona episode. The man he had pointed to, Gregory Cheadle, a local real estate broker running for a Republican nomination for a congressional seat, said in an interview Friday night that it was \u201csurreal\u201d to be called out by Mr. Trump. Mr. Cheadle said he was not offended by the remark, which he at first could not hear over the noise of the crowd. \u201cI\u2019ve had people come to me  \u2014   and these were whites  \u2014   tell me that they were offended,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I appreciate them saying that, but I wasn\u2019t offended by it. \u201d He also clarified that he is not actually a Trump supporter, saying that he went to a Bernie Sanders rally the night before. \u201cI\u2019d describe myself as someone who is searching for answers,\u201d Mr. Cheadle said. At the Arizona rally Mr. Trump was referring to, a Trump supporter punched a protester wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit as the person was being escorted out. \u201cAs the     this guy, and this guy never knew what happened, everybody thought the   was against me, and it was the opposite,\u201d Mr. Trump said at his rally Friday. \u201cHe was like this great guy, military guy. We have tremendous   support. The reason is I\u2019m going to bring jobs back to our country. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s comments come as his campaign is fending off charges of racism over his remarks about Gonzalo P. Curiel, the federal judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University. Mr. Trump has suggested that he believes the judge is biased because he \u201chappens to be, we believe, Mexican. \u201d Judge Curiel was born in Indiana he is of Mexican descent.'"}, "time": 1742563257.6628718}
