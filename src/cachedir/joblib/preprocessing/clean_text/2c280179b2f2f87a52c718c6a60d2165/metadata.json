C. He was joined by a Jewish White House colleague, along with several dozen other Jews. [All of these Jews were unaware, apparently, that in their midst a hidden Nazi was lurking  \u2014   at least, according to the Forward, which attempted Thursday to claim that Gorka is secretly a member of a Nazi organization.  We have been here before. Last month, a   blogger made the same false claim, which was thoroughly debunked by Breitbart News (where Gorka was once an editor) and others. The Forward now claims Gorka once pledged loyalty to the Historical Vit\u00e9zi Rend, a racist rival to the Vit\u00e9zi Rend, which is a postwar anticommunist organization. (The word \u201chistorical\u201d was added to allude to the original Vit\u00e9zi Rend, which was   by Hungary\u2019s   government and later banned.) Gorka denies it all. And as Trump critic Liel Leibovitz notes in Tablet, the Forward offers no proof other than the claims of the Historical Vit\u00e9zi Rend, whom the Forward suddenly deems a trustworthy source not requiring further corroboration. It is possible to play this game both ways: In 2015, the Forward changed its name from \u201cThe Jewish Daily Forward\u201d to simply \u201cthe Forward. \u201d This, apparently, was a nod to   antisemites. After all, the Forward is critical of Israel. Verdict: Guilty! Not to be outdone, the execrable Stephen Goldstein of the Anne Frank Center  \u2014   a man who desecrates the Holocaust by abusing it in his partisan attacks against the Trump administration  \u2014   demanded that Gorka resign, claiming that \u201cgrotesque Antisemitism   \u2026     has infected the Trump White House. \u201d That absurd statement, like the article that inspired it, is nothing more than the defamation of a good man and the most   administration in U. S. history, staffed to the rafters with Jews. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the \u201cmost influential\u201d people in news media in 2016.
