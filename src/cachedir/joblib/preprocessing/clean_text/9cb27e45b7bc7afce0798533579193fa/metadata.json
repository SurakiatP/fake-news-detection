In political terms, \u201cevolving\u201d is usually a term used by the left, a euphemism to describe when a politician has changed his or her position. Its most significant use was in regards to President Barack Obama\u2019s views on gay marriage, which were said to have \u201cevolved\u201d from outright Christian opposition to   liberal embrace. Like the term \u201cprogressive,\u201d the term \u201cevolution\u201d implies an improvement in moral and intellectual terms, from prejudice and ignorance to reason and enlightenment. The left, presuming that its own views are superior, and that the \u201clong arc of history\u201d bends in its direction, expects people to \u201cevolve\u201d in its direction. What was stranger were Cohn\u2019s words explaining how Trump is said to be evolving. The president, he said, was becoming \u201csmarter\u201d and becoming \u201cmore knowledgeable\u201d about the issue. Again, that could mean Trump is growing skeptical of the alarmist,   view around which our public debate on climate change revolves. (In obtaining a degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard, for instance, I became more knowledgeable about the problems in modeling climate  \u2014   problems that have not improved much since then, despite the radical advances in computer technology and data analysis.) It is also possible that Cohn was shaping his assessment of the president\u2019s views to flatter his largely European audience, which believes in climate change the way people on other continents believe in religion. That flattery may have been appropriate, for diplomatic reasons. What defies explanation is why he would imply that his boss had previously been less \u201csmart\u201d about the issue, or less well informed. It is the kind of comment that tends to reinforce the false narrative the media spins about every single Republican president  \u2014   i. e. that he is stupid. It is also a comment that carries considerable political risk. Conservatives resent being told, usually by leftists, that their generally skeptical views on climate change are poorly informed, or \u201cdenialist. \u201d Often, the leftists making such accusations cannot actually explain themselves how climate change is presumed to take place, and never consider a view other than their own. For now, conservatives continue to hold out hope that the president \u201cevolves\u201d the U. S. out of the Paris climate agreement and toward a more sensible policy that uses innovation in energy technology to harness domestic resources of all kinds, and grow the U. S. economy while reducing emissions. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the \u201cmost influential\u201d people in news media in 2016.
