Watch the clip and read the animator\\'s thoughts on Trump below. When Donald Trump warns of a rigged election depriving him of the White House, his call to arms will most likely be a call to his lawyers. Judging by his track record, surely there has never been a more sue-happy nominee for president . If voters don\u2019t cooperate by Making America Great Again, maybe The Donald can sue his way to the White House. The American Bar Association sponsored a report that looked into Trump being a \u201clibel bully,\u201d that is, suing people willy-nilly to shut them up. The report on Trump was so ominous, the ABA refused to publish it. Fortunately, you can find it here . If Donald Trump will sue anyone from bartenders to journalists to Miss Pennsylvania, surely he is not above suing voters who have the temerity to vote for Hillary Clinton. Of course lawyers helped get George W. Bush into the Oval Office, but Trump-law is a different story . Enjoy the cartoon and be sure to see what\u2019s going on over on my Patreon page .
