[Gorka said one of the greatest accomplishments of the first 100 days was President Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress, which he described as a moment when the mainstream media\u2019s \u201creportage, the politically spun reportage, was just blown out of the water\u201d:  I don\u2019t know if you recall  \u2014   on that day and the day before, for 24 hours  \u2014   there was this, \u201che\u2019s going to go soft on this, they\u2019re not going to keep their promises, they\u2019re not going to talk about the threat as it really is. \u201d It\u2019s very, very interesting to go back and not just read the transcript, but watch the video, and that moment when the    pauses, looks straight at the camera, and says, \u201cthe enemy is radical Islamic terrorism. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve set the marker down that we\u2019re going to take politics out of the threat assessment. We\u2019re no longer going to allow political correctness to distort who the enemy is, and how we report about them,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m biased because I worked on that for years at Breitbart and elsewhere,\u201d he admitted cheerfully. \u201cNumber Two is a broader issue that spans everything, whether it\u2019s North Korea, whether it\u2019s Moscow, whether it\u2019s ISIS, or anybody else, and it\u2019s the different way of going around and doing national business that the president has brought to the table,\u201d Gorka continued. He promised: Here I mean the complete rejection of leading from behind, of \u201cstrategic patience. \u201d When the vice president last week gave that address on the deck of the USS Ronald Reagan and said \u201cthe era of strategic patience is gone. The world is a dangerous place, and it is a safer place when we are helping guide and lead reactions to those threats\u201d  \u2014   not, and this is really important for your listeners, not as neoconservatives. This is not a third Bush term. But we will lead, and when people do things such as use chemical weapons against women and children, the president will take action. Dr. Gorka\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and successor as Breitbart News, national security editor Frances Martel, noted that President Trump has been criticized for insisting on using the language of \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d but is given little credit for his outreach to Middle Eastern allies like Egypt. She asked if Gorka was satisfied with the level of engagement between the Trump administration and America\u2019s allies. Gorka responded by inviting listeners to Google the meeting between President Trump and President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt and \u201cjust look at the expression\u201d on the latter\u2019s face. \u201cHe\u2019s sitting down with the leader of the free world. The smile, the body language, the positivity,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cWe did our Muslim partners in the region a great, great disservice in the last eight years. We did not assist them in fighting the jihadis in their backyards. Think about what\u2019s going on in the Sinai right now, with Beit   an ISIS affiliate in Egypt. \u201d \u201cWe did some very bad things,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIf you look at the JCPOA, the Iran deal, if you look at the unleashing of billions of dollars to Tehran, the people who are most on the frontline of the war with groups like ISIS and    \u2014   our Sunni friends  \u2014   felt like they had simply been left by the wayside. They felt that the last administration had chosen a side in this war, and it was the Shia extremists in Tehran. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve changed all that. The president is clear: we are not going to fight anybody\u2019s wars for them. We will help our friends and allies fight their own wars for themselves  \u2014   with trainers, with advice, with intelligence as required. We are there for our Sunni allies: Egypt, Jordan, the Emiratis, even the Kurds of the region,\u201d he declared. \u201cI think what we have achieved in just the last 14 weeks, as compared to the last 8 years, sends a very clear message. We\u2019re not about invading other people\u2019s countries. We\u2019re not about occupying them, but we will help our friends. There\u2019s a certain Marine division that interestingly has supplied two of our cabinet members, and that Marine division has a very interesting motto: \u2018No better friend, no worse enemy.\u2019 I think people understand that we have started a new era in relations around the world,\u201d said Gorka. Turning to the other major foreign policy crisis of the moment, Gorka said the Trump administration would follow \u201cclassic strategic behavior\u201d in dealing with North Korea. \u201cYou send messages overtly, you send them implicitly,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cI think everybody by now understands the MOAB attack in Afghanistan, the cruise missile attack in Syria  \u2014   neither of those uses of force by the president are just about the countries in which they occurred. \u201d \u201cSo we send implicit messages, explicit messages, but we don\u2019t give the playbook away,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople constantly ask me, \u2018So what\u2019s next in North Korea? What\u2019s next with regard to relations with Russia?\u2019 and so forth. We\u2019re not going to give that away because that\u2019s astrategic. When you play poker, you don\u2019t show your hand to the people sitting around the table. \u201d Breitbart News Daily host Alexander Marlow joked that his propensity for showing his cards to everyone else at the table might explain his long losing streak at poker. \u201cPresident Clinton did that in the Balkans in  . He told the Milosevich regime what he was going to do and what he wasn\u2019t going to do,\u201d Gorka recalled. \u201cAnd the last administration did it with Mosul, telegraphing when we\u2019re coming and when we\u2019re not coming, and what we\u2019re going to do. That is a way to lose, not a way to win, and this president is all about winning. We know that. \u201d \u201cThe general principles will stand: American leadership is back. We have certain red lines we will act upon them should they be breached. We understand that we have inherited a world on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s one metric I love to use: when we took office  \u2014   this is according to the United Nations, hardly a hotbed of   analysis  \u2014   the United Nations has stated there are 65 million refugees in the world today. That is a world historic record. We had less refugees in 1945 at the cessation of hostilities that was World War II,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cSo we know the world is a dangerous place, but we\u2019re going to make it less dangerous by exercising strategic leadership  \u2014   not in a   sense, but in a patriotic sense that supports our friends and allies,\u201d Gorka averred.
