I mean, look, they\u2019re going to arrive in Washington and for them to be successful, they have to stake out positions that Donna will not like and the left will hate. My deepest concern is that they\u2019re going to arrive, you\u2019re going to have the greens going crazy over at EPA and Interior. You\u2019re going to have the government employees going crazy about civil service reform. You\u2019re going to have the teachers union going crazy over school choice. And these are pretty nonnegotiable. I mean, if you\u2019re serious about school choice, there is no agreement with the teachers union. \u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m worried when they realize how big the problem is that they decide that they\u2019re just going to do the best they can and give in. \u201d (  ABC News) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562650.7974145}
