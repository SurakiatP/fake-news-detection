The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,\u201d the source added. \\nA second source confirmed the fireworks. \\n\u201cThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks,\u201d the other source said. \\n\u201cTrump kept saying, \u2018We\u2019re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.\u2019 He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars,\u201d the source said. \\n\u201cTrump didn\u2019t say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate \u2013 which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.\u201d \\nThe stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a Trump Administration. \\n\u201c[CBS Good Morning co-host Gayle] King did not stand up, but asked some question, \u2018How do you propose we the media work with you?\u2019 Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked \u2018How are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.\u201d \\nHere\u2019s a sampling of Trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail. Trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before, he won the election in a landslide, in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down: \\nTrump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway told reporters the gathering went well. \\n\u201cExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks,\u201d she said during a gaggle in the lobby of Trump Tower. \u201cPretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.\u201d \\nThe meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations. \\nThe hour-long session included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC\u2019s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC\u2019s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, \\nAlso, CBS\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell John Dickerson, Charlie Rose, Christopher Isham and King, Fox News\u2019 Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott, MSNBC\u2019s Phil Griffin and CNN\u2019s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. -Via : NYP  '"}, "time": 1742561873.2135053}
