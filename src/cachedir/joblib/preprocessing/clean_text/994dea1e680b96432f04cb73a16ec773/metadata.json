Cassian Folsom was preparing to celebrate morning Mass one recent Sunday when suddenly the earth started trembling. \u201cStones and roof tiles started raining down on our heads,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was a terrifying experience. \u201d When the dust settled, he and the other monks  \u2014   almost all of them transplanted from the United States  \u2014   found their beloved Basilica of St. Benedict, built centuries ago in Norcia in the central Italian mountains to mark its namesake\u2019s birthplace, in ruins. After the Oct. 30 quake, one of the few things left standing at the monastery was a small brewery, where for the past four years the monks have been making Nursia, a beer named for Norcia\u2019s ancient Latin appellation. Their brew may now be the salvation  \u2014   symbolically, at least  \u2014   not only of the monks\u2019 sanctuary, but also of Norcia itself. This ancient walled city is a ghost town of ravaged churches and cracked palazzi, and is still struggling to recover from the strongest earthquake to strike Italy in 36 years. \u201cRemarkably, the brewery was hardly damaged,\u201d the Rev. Benedict Nivakoff, who is from Connecticut, said during a chilly morning walk through the devastated town center. \u201cThe fermenters were loosed, but they\u2019re tall and heavy, and so they didn\u2019t fall. \u201d The monks are planning to move the beer from the brewery to a safer location, where it can be bottled and specially labeled before it is sold to raise money for reconstruction, Father Nivakoff said. The monks set up a website for their   efforts after the basilica and monastery had been weakened by earthquakes and aftershocks in August. \u201cThe campaign started then  \u2014   now we need to add a few more zeros,\u201d said Father Nivakoff, the prior of the monastery. It is not be the first time the monastery has had to revive itself. The American monks arrived in 2000, under a plan by their order, the local archbishop, residents and town officials to populate a priory that had been abandoned since 1810, when Napoleon suppressed monastic orders here. Led by Father Folsom, who is the prior emeritus, the monks now number 15. They learned   from experienced Trappist brewmasters in Belgium, and began to make Nursia in 2012. The beer\u2019s name was chosen \u201cspecifically to help the townspeople, rather than naming it after St. Benedict,\u201d Father Nivakoff said. \u201cWe wanted people to identify the beer with the town,\u201d and to help support it, he added. Brother Augustine Wilmeth, who was born in South Carolina and serves as the brewmaster, said Nursia was \u201cthe only monastic beer in the world that is made exclusively by the monks. \u201d Other monastic brewing operations, he explained, have grown into   enterprises with many workers. In Norcia, the monks do everything themselves, producing around 10, 000 bottles each month. The monks, in the tradition of St. Benedict, who believed they should live and support themselves by the work of their hands, intend to keep the brewery small. That way, Brother Wilmeth said, \u201cit will stay in our control and really serve monastic life, not overwhelm and consume us. \u201d The monastery\u2019s beer varieties quickly gained an enthusiastic following in local shops and restaurants, and the brewery began exporting to the United States this year. If many of the regional venues that sold the beer are shuttered because of the earthquake, it is still available through American importers, the monks said. St. Benedict, whom Pope Paul VI named a patron saint of Europe in 1964, and his twin sister, Scholastica, who also later became a saint, were born in Norcia around 480, and the remains of what some believe to be their house were once visible beneath the basilica. Benedict founded several monastic communities, including one at Monte Cassino, where he died in 543. His Rule of St. Benedict, a series of teachings for monks, formed the basic precepts for thousands of monasteries in Europe. \u201cWe have tried to help the townspeople to dig deeper and discover an identity that goes beyond prosciutto and truffles,\u201d said Father Nivakoff, referring to two of the things the Umbrian city is known for. \u201cI think in the last 15 years we\u2019ve managed to do that. \u201d Mayor Nicola Alemanno said, \u201cWith this community of American monks, the value that St. Benedict has for Europe assumes a global significance,\u201d adding: \u201cThey have become a spiritual and cultural point of reference first for the city, then for Umbria and then for Italy. \u201d The monks\u2019 message also achieved global recognition in 2015 when \u201cBenedicta,\u201d an album of traditional Latin Marian chants, spent 19 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s classical chart. Singing, Father Folsom explained, \u201cis our spiritual nourishment  \u2014   that\u2019s where the spiritual energy comes from. \u201d He added that the monks chanted for about six hours each day. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a part of our lives,\u201d the Rev. Basil Nixen, the monastery\u2019s choirmaster, said. Before the earthquake, the muted hums of the chanting monks were familiar sounds in Norcia. The beer has also become very much a part of their lives. If   efforts can help both the sanctuary and Norcia live again, they say, the monks are happy to repay their benefactors  \u2014   even in a small, frothy way. \u201cWe are proud that we are American,\u201d said the Rev. Martin Bernhard, who is from Texas and is the cellarer of the monastery. \u201cTo taste and buy our beer is a beautiful thing for us. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564113.759996}
