A great, unselfish, compassionate woman, to paraphrase Robert Kennedy. And when you add up all my advantages, it\u2019s clear I\u2019m indispensable too \u2013 someone all others can look to for leadership. \\nAnd what I\u2019m really excited about is not just that I\u2019m indispensable, but that I\u2019m about to become President of the indispensable nation. An indispensable nation needs an indispensable woman. An indispensable woman needs an indispensable nation. It\u2019s a match made in heaven, which is why I am asking you to help me break the glass ceiling on November 8th \u2013 so that together we can become even more exceptional than we already are. \\nSo what makes me so indispensable? \\nI\u2019m indispensable in part because of my love for our armed forces. Our military is the greatest in history, with the best troops, training and technology, and I believe it is a travesty that we are not using it to its full potential. It\u2019s essential we do everything we can to support our men and women in uniform, and I intend to do just that by sending our brave soldiers on important missions around the globe from day one of my presidency. \\nI\u2019m indispensable because of my commitment to the truth. Throughout my career, I\u2019ve always sought to stay close to the truth. I know that there\u2019s a lot of folks out there who say I\u2019m corrupt. But those who know me closest will tell you that this isn\u2019t the real Hillary. Ask those who know me best. Ask my husband Bill. He\u2019ll tell you. Ask my campaign chairman John Podesta. He\u2019ll tell you. Ask Lloyd Blankfein, CEO at Goldman Sachs. He\u2019ll tell you. Ask some of our closest allies in places like Saudi Arabia. They\u2019ll tell you. They will all tell you about the real Hillary, and that my commitment to honesty and fighting corruption is second to none. It may even be my most exceptional quality. Alongside humility. \\nI\u2019m also indispensable because of my network of alliances and supporters. You only have to look at who they are. Has there ever been a candidate in the entire history of our exceptional nation that has managed to get the backing of the entire media and corporate America? I don\u2019t think so. But it does tell you something, doesn\u2019t it? I humbly submit that it speaks volumes that some of the most important people in our exceptional country are prepared to place their trust in me. \\nI\u2019m indispensable because, unlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t need to rely on the help of people like Vladimir Putin and countries like Russia to help get me elected. Can you imagine me having to rely on Putin and Russia to get elected? Of course I\u2019ve had to bring Putin and Russia up in this campaign from time to time, not because I want to keep bringing Putin and Russia into it. In fact, the only reason I\u2019ve occasionally mentioned Putin and Russia is not because I want to keep talking about Putin and Russia, but because I have to keep taking about Putin and Russia because Trump is depending on Putin and Russia to get him elected and so I have to draw attention to Putin and Russia. But trust me, if I had my way I wouldn\u2019t bring Putin and Russia up at all. \\nI\u2019m indispensable because of my commitment to helping countries get rid of their dictators, and establishing democracy and peace. Like Libya, for example. We came. We saw. He died. And the Libyans got their liberty. \\nMost of all, I\u2019m \\xadindispensable \u2014 and exceptional \u2014 because of my values. \\nTake my commitment to human rights, which I have shown by being one of the most vocal supporters of a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy, right up to a few seconds before the thing inside her becomes a human. \\nTake my commitment to raising money, which my husband and I have shown through our tireless work with the Clinton Foundation, and in making hundreds of speeches for various organisations. \\nTake my commitment to making the world a better place, which I\u2019ve shown time and time again by saying things like \u201clove trumps hate\u201d. Which it does, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019m proud of that expression. \\nBut with all of these advantages comes \\xadresponsibility \u2013 I need to lead the world. You need me to lead the world. Because if I fail to lead, I will leave a vacuum that lets extremists, Putin and Russia, haters, bigots, the intolerant, Putin and Russia, the severely backwards , the Julian Assange\u2019s of this world,Putin and Russia \u2013 Baskets of Deplorables \u2013 take root everywhere. \\nOf course, being exceptional doesn\u2019t mean that other people don\u2019t also have something to offer \u2014 maybe they do. But I have an unparalleled ability to be a force for peace, progress and prosperity around the world, which I intend to demonstrate on day one of my presidency, by standing up to Putin and Russia and showing Putin and Russia who\u2019s boss. \\nI\u2019ll never stop doing good. Never. That\u2019s what makes me great. I\u2019m good because I\u2019m great, and I\u2019ll tell you one thing, I\u2019ll never stop. \\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m indispensable. \\nLet\u2019s keep me exceptional.
