The new version is far more worrying than the first, which found \u201cno evidence that fracking systemically contaminates water\u201d supplies. In a significant change, that conclusion was deleted from the final study. \u201cE. P. A. scientists chose not to include that sentence. The scientists concluded it could not be quantitatively supported,\u201d said Thomas A. Burke, the E. P. A. \u2019s science adviser, and deputy assistant administrator of the agency\u2019s Office of Research and Development. The report, the largest and most comprehensive of its kind to date on the effects of fracking on water supply, comes as   Donald J. Trump has vowed to expand fracking and roll back existing regulations on the process. His choice to run the E. P. A. Scott Pruitt, the attorney general from Oklahoma, has built his career on fighting E. P. A. regulations on energy exploration. Among Mr. Trump\u2019s key energy policy advisers are Harold Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Resources, an energy firm that has been at the forefront of the fracking boom, and Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, a state transformed by fracking. Now that team must contend with scientific findings that urge caution in an energy sector that Mr. Trump wants to untether. Mr. Burke said that the new report found evidence that fracking has contributed to drinking water contamination in all stages of the process: acquiring water to be used for fracking, mixing the water with chemical additives to make fracking fluids, injecting the chemical fluids underground, collecting the wastewater that flows out of fracking wells after injections, and storing the used wastewater. Still, Mr. Burke said that the report remained \u201cfull of gaps and holes,\u201d and that the issue required far more study. He declined to offer policy recommendations based on the study, saying that it will \u201cgive a lot of information to help communities and decision makers do better in protecting water supplies. \u201d What kind of audience the new team of decision makers will be seems clear. In September, Mr. Trump promised a corporate conference of fracking executives in Pittsburgh: \u201cThe shale energy revolution will unleash massive wealth for America,\u201d as he vowed to end regulations on fracking. \u201cI think probably no other business has been affected by regulation than your business,\u201d he told the gas executives. \u201cFederal regulations remain a major restriction to shale production. \u201d Fracking is subject to only light federal regulations. The Obama administration has put forth one rule intended to protect water from fracking waste. But that rule applies only to fracking on public lands, which hold about 100, 000 fracking wells  \u2014   representing about 10 percent of all fracking in the United States. The vast majority of fracking occurs on state or private land and is governed by state and local regulations. Environmentalists seized on the new report as evidence that the federal government should strengthen federal protections on fracking. \u201cThis report acknowledges what far too many communities across this country know to be true  \u2014   fracking is a threat to our clean drinking water,\u201d said Madeleine Foote, the legislative representative for the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cGiven E. P. A. administrator nominee Scott Pruitt\u2019s record of fighting fracking regulations, it will be important during the confirmation process for senators to ask him if he will follow the recommendations of his agency\u2019s scientists, or continue to rely on industry spin,\u201d she said. Fracking advocates dismissed the report. \u201cEven the new statement is still consistent with the finding that contamination attributable to shale development is neither widespread nor systemic,\u201d Scott H. Segal, a fossil fuel lobbyist with the firm Bracewell Law LLP, wrote in an email. \u201cBut evidence of contamination is highly anecdotal and often overblown by the exaggeration often associated with litigation. The vast majority of   professional organizations and governmental officials have found shale development to be highly consistent with environmental protection and energy policy objectives. \u201d The E. P. A has been working on the report since 2010, when it was requested by Congress. Mr. Burke called the study unprecedented in scope and depth, saying it included a review of over 1, 000 existing studies as well as new research, modeling and analysis conducted by E. P. A scientists. In the process of completing the study, the E. P. A. produced 13   reports and published as many studies in scientific journals.'"}, "time": 1742563442.6420183}
