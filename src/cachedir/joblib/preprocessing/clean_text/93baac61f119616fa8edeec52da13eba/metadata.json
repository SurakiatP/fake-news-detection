It\u2019s not a question of Trump, it is an imperative that Hillary be defeated. If the people choose Hillary, then they must and will be punished. \\n\u201cWikileaks: Bill Clinton Boasts of Hillary\u2019s \u2018Working Relationship\u2019 with Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d By John Hayward , Breitbart, October 26, 2016: \\nIn a speech Bill Clinton gave at the home of Mehul and Hema Sanghani in October 2015, revealed to the public for the first time by WikiLeaks, former President Bill Clinton touted Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cworking relationship\u201d with the Muslim Brotherhood \u2019s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of her diplomatic skills.President Clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, in a passage that began with the standard Democrat \u201cstuff happens\u201d shrugging defense for foreign policy failures: \\nFinally, we live in a world, as I said, that\u2019s full of good news and bad news. The United States cannot control it all, but we need a president who\u2019s most likely to make as many good things happen as possible, and most likely to prevent big, bad things from happening. You can\u2019t keep every bad thing from happening; who\u2019s most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way. Even the people who don\u2019t like the Iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadn\u2019t been for the sanctions. Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off \u2013 something I thought she\u2019d never be able to do. I confess. I\u2019m never surprised by anything she does, but that surprised me. I didn\u2019t think she could do it. The Chinese and the Russians to see past their short-term self-interest to their long-term interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race. \\nAnd when the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt, in spite of the fact that we were (inaudible), she developed a working relationship with the then-president and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a full-scale shooting war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which on top of what was going on in Syria and the (inaudible) Jordan would have been a calamity for the world. \\nAnd when we were trying to reset our relations with Russia under President Medvedev, she and her team negotiated a New START Treaty, which limits warheads and missiles. And she lobbied it through the Senate. She had to get 67 votes, which means a lot of these Republicans who say that they don\u2019t like her now are just kidding for election season. They trusted her, and she got it passed. You can\u2019t get 67 votes in the Senate without a lot of Republican support. And I don\u2019t know about you, but with all this tension and Mr. Putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in Syria, I think it\u2019s a very good thing that we\u2019re in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the Russians. She did that. \\nYou\u2019ll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the Iran debacle than Bill Clinton boasting that the sanctions Barack Obama lifted were super-awesome, as even those who don\u2019t think those sanctions should have been lifted agree. \\nMr. Clinton\u2019s version of the Iran sanctions leaves out a few details , such as Russia\u2019s keen financial interest in keeping Iranian energy out of the European market, and China\u2019s desire to use Iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip. \\nBut the part about the Muslim Brotherhood is most interesting. If anything, he is selling Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cworking relationship\u201d with Egyptian Islamists short, because she used American diplomatic leverage for Morsi\u2019s benefit even before he got elected, warning Egyptians about \u201cbacktracking\u201d to a military regime at a key moment of the post-Mubarak campaign, when Morsi was running against a former member of Hosni Mubarak\u2019s military. There have long been rumors that more subtle forms of U.S. \u201c pressure \u201d were used to secure Morsi\u2019s office, as well. \\nThen again, in public pronouncements, Clinton called Hosni Mubarak\u2019s tottering regime \u201cstable\u201d and cautioned her Obama Administration colleagues against \u201cpushing a longtime partner out the door.\u201d \\nA few days ago, declassified State Department documents revealed Clinton\u2019s talking points for a 2012 meeting with Morsi hailed his election as a \u201cmilestone in Egypt\u2019s transition to democracy,\u201d and stated that she was to offer the Muslim Brotherhood leader \u201ctechnical expertise and assistance from both the U.S. government and private sector to support his economic and social programs.\u201d \\nClinton was also supposed to privately offer Morsi assistance with his police and security forces, which would be conducted \u201cquite discreetly.\u201d \\nAfter Morsi was gone, she declared herself exasperated with Egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical \u201crealist.\u201d That is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the Obama Administration was saying while the \u201cArab Spring\u201d was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but America-aligned (or at least America-fearing) regimes, which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long. \\nAs for Clinton\u2019s superb working relationship with Morsi, that eventually ended with Morsi\u2019s wife railing against Clinton for supposedly dismissing him as \u201ca simpleton who was unfit for the presidency,\u201d and threatening to publish letters from Clinton to Morsi that would damage the former U.S. Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Mohammed Morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the Egyptian penitentiary system . \\nEgypt has one of those icky military governments again, and while it won\u2019t have fond memories of Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for the Muslim Brotherhood regime, it will most likely work with whoever wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Therefore, a prospective President Hillary Clinton probably won\u2019t suffer too much from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s appalling lapses in judgment. \\nArticle reposted with permission from PamelaGeller.com'"}, "time": 1742562078.8980846}
