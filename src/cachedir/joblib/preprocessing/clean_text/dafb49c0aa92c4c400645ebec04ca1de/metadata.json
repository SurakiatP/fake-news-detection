I think subconsciously people understand to be a \u201cDoctor\u201d is to be a teacher, but on the surface most people find it odd and uncomfortable to accept my interest and quest in something that rarely occurs to them. \\nOccasionally, there will be debate. I don\u2019t necessarily look for them. Experience with humans of all ages and from all walks of life has afforded me a healthy dose of humility. But I\u2019m happy and proud to go as far as anyone would like about money, finance and especially silver. \\nNo matter how tempting it is, no matter how strong the need is to be right and to feel vindicated, it is normally fruitless. I don\u2019t know where I first heard it, but one of my favorite expressions has become: \\n\u201cI can explain it to you, but I can\u2019t understand it for you.\u201d \\nUnderstanding requires a shift. One that, I feel myself almost cringing to admit, involves emotional intelligence. This goes against all rational logic. \\nMost people are polite. And I\u2019ll admit to a tendency for avoiding conflict \u2014 especially given the context in which many of these (potential) debates typically arise. \\nI came across the following article by accident some time back . It immediately resonated with my own experience in wrestling with my own beliefs, but also the beliefs, world views, and opinions of people I care about. \\nAnd collectively speaking, the opinions and views of anyone with a pulse who cares about financial safety, justice, and wealth. \\nYou are, I\u2019m afraid to say, mistaken. The position you are taking makes no logical sense. Just listen up and I\u2019ll be more than happy to elaborate on the many, many reasons why I\u2019m right and you are wrong. Are you feeling ready to be convinced? \\nWhether the subject is climate engineering, the Middle East or forthcoming holiday plans, this is the approach many of us adopt when we try to convince others to change their minds. It\u2019s also an approach that, more often than not, leads to the person on the receiving end hardening their existing position. \\n(Ed. For the subject of money and wealth, at the root lies the fear of loss \u2013 more powerful than the want of profit. People will do anything, and convince themselves of practically anything, to avoid loss.) \\nFortunately, research suggests there is a better way \u2013 one that involves more listening and less trying to bludgeon your opponent into submission. \\nA little over a decade ago Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil from Yale University suggested that in many instances people believe they understand how something works when in fact their understanding is superficial at best. \\nThey called this phenomenon \u201cthe illusion of explanatory depth\u201d. \\nThey began by asking their study participants to rate how well they understood how things like flushing toilets, car speedometers and sewing machines worked before asking them to explain what they understood and then answer questions on it. \\nThe effect they revealed was that, on average, people in the experiment rated their understanding as much worse after it had been put to the test. \\nWhat happens, argued the researchers, is that we mistake our familiarity with these things for the belief that we have a detailed understanding of how they work. \\n(I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve experienced this with the topic of money and currency. We use the terms interchangeably, though they are very different in reality. I\u2019ll never forget the transformation I witnessed in a \u201cBitcoin aficionado\u201d \u2013 arriving from the technological side of things \u2013 coming to grips with the store of wealth versus currency.) \\nUsually, nobody tests us and if we have any questions about them we can just take a look. Psychologists call this idea that humans have a tendency to take mental shortcuts when making decisions or assessments the \u201ccognitive miser\u201d theory. \\nWhy would we bother expending the effort to really understand things when we can get by without doing so? The interesting thing is that we manage to hide from ourselves exactly how shallow our understanding is. \\nIt\u2019s a phenomenon that will be familiar to anyone who has ever had to teach something. Usually, it only takes the first moments when you start to rehearse what you\u2019ll say to explain a topic (or worse, the first student question) for you to realize that you don\u2019t truly understand it. \\nAll over the world, teachers say to each other \u201cI didn\u2019t really understand this until I had to teach it.\u201d Or as researcher and inventor Mark Changizi quipped: \u201cI find that no matter how badly I teach I still learn something.\u201d \\nExplain Yourself \\nResearch published last year on this illusion of understanding shows how the effect might be used to convince others they are wrong. \\nThe research team, led by Philip Fernbach of the University of Colorado, reasoned that the phenomenon might hold as much for political understanding as for things like how toilets work. \\nPerhaps, they figured, people who have strong political opinions would be more open to other viewpoints, if asked to explain exactly how they thought the policy they were advocating would bring about the effects they claimed it would. \\nRecruiting a sample of Americans via the internet, they polled participants on a set of contentious U.S. policy issues, such as imposing sanctions on Iran, healthcare and approaches to carbon emissions. \\nOne group was asked to give their opinion and then provide reasons for why they held that view. This group got the opportunity to put their side of the issue, in the same way anyone in an argument or debate has a chance to argue their case. \\nThose in the second group did something subtly different. Rather than provide reasons, they were asked to explain how the policy they were advocating would work. They were asked to trace, step by step, from start to finish, the causal path from the policy to the effects it was supposed to have. \\nThe results were clear. People who provided reasons remained as convinced of their positions as they had been before the experiment. Those who were asked to provide explanations softened their views, and reported a correspondingly larger drop in how they rated their understanding of the issues.'"}, "time": 1742562121.5974014}
