Black Agenda Report for Week of Oct 31, 2016 Submitted by Nellie Bailey a... on Mon, 10/31/2016 - 20:45 Venezuela The Missing Black Movement Ingredient: Self-Determination \\nThe Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations will hold a National Black Political Convention on Self-Determination, November 5 and 6, in Washington, DC. \u201cIf you go through history, the fundamental thing that we\u2019ve confronted is the loss of our self-determination as a people,\u201d said Black Is Back chairman Omali Yeshitela . The Coalition has put forward a 19-point position on the need to put self-determination at the center of Black struggles. The 19 points \u201cgive us the beginning of some kind of a plan,\u201d said Yeshitela. \u201cIt says, specifically, here is our view on self-determination and the subject of reparations, Black women, the question of police invasion and brutality in our community,\u201d and many other issues. The \u201cMoment of Truth\u201d for the Empire \\n\u201cWe are entering a new moment in American history,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Monteiro , the Duboisian scholar and Black Radical Organizing Committee activist. \u201cIt is a moment of truth for the ruling class, for the ruling elite. What do they do when they are trumped at home -- forgive the pun -- and trumped internationally?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo they back off of empire, do they readjust, do they become peaceful, or do they up the stakes and attempt to resolve all problems with war abroad and oppression at home?\u201d Dr. Monteiro is one of the planners of a Revolutionary Science for Radical Times conference, in Philadelphia, December 9 and 10. Hard Times in Venezuela \\nDespite what the corporate media are telling you, Venezuelans are not starving and the Socialist Party government will not be toppled any time soon. However, the rightwing opposition \u201cis smelling blood\u201d due to an economic crisis that \u201chas made it very difficult for people to get access to imported goods, and many goods are very expensive,\u201d said political science professor George Caccariello-Maher , of Drexel University, author of We Created Chavez: A People\u2019s History of the Venezuelan Revolution . Corruption, smuggling and money speculation are serious problems, said Caccariello-Maher. However, the strength of the Left lies in the nation\u2019s grassroots organizations and communes. \u201cIt would be very difficult for an opposition government to come in and attempt to throw them off their land\u201d or return property to the private sector, he said. Happy Birthday, Rev. Pinkney! \\nBenton Harbor, Michigan, human rights leader Rev. Edward Pinkney, currently serving a 2 \u00bd to 10 year sentence on election tampering charges, turned 68 years old this month. Marcina Cole , a courtroom observer at Pinkney\u2019s trial, teamed up with David Sole , of the Michigan Emergency Committee Against War and Injustice, to throw a birthday party for Pinkney, in absentia, in Detroit. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely in support of other inmates, doing ministry work, and looking forward to being out very soon,\u201d said Cole. She reported that Green Party vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka visited the political prisoner on October 19. \u201cThis was historical,\u201d said Cole. \u201cThey know how powerful Rev. Pinkney is\u201d -- and that he has allies on the outside. Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey.
