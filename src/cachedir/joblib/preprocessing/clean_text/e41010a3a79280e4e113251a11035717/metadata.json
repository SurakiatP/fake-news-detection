PAUL  \u2014   President Obama, reacting with the same horror as many Americans to a grisly video of a bloody, dying man in Minnesota who was shot by the police, begged the nation to confront the racial disparities in law enforcement while acknowledging the dangers that officers face. \u201cWhen incidents like this occur, there\u2019s a big chunk of our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement on Thursday after arriving in Warsaw for a NATO summit. \u201cThis is not just a black issue, not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we all should care about. \u201d A few hours earlier, Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota, who seemed shaken by the video showing the man, Philando Castile, as he died, also pointed to the role of race. \u201cWould this have happened if the driver were white, if the passengers were white?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have. \u201d The statements capped a wrenching day that started with widespread replays of the extraordinary video of Mr. Castile\u2019s final moments and the aftermath of the shooting, which his girlfriend had narrated as they occurred live on Facebook. There were demonstrations and a vigil for Mr. Castile, with appearances by members of his family, in St. Paul. But the shooting reverberated far beyond the state. In Dallas, gunfire broke out Thursday evening at a demonstration, turning a vocal but peaceful rally into chaos as two snipers shot at police officers, killing five of them, the police said. Mr. Dayton and members of Minnesota\u2019s congressional delegation asked for the Justice Department to investigate the death of Mr. Castile, 32, who died hours after the department took over the investigation into the fatal police shooting, also captured on video, in Baton Rouge, La. The governor said he had spoken with White House and Justice Department officials. But the department responded that for now, it would leave the investigation to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and would offer assistance. The shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota follow a long string of deaths of black people at the hands of the police  \u2014   in Staten Island Cleveland Baltimore Ferguson, Mo. and North Charleston, S. C. among others  \u2014   that have stoked outrage around the country. The encounters, many of them at least partly caught on video, have led to intense debate about race relations and law enforcement. Mr. Obama, in Warsaw, said he felt compelled to follow up a Facebook message with a personal statement about the killings, though he said he could not comment directly on them. \u201cBut what I can say is that all of us, as Americans, should be troubled by these shootings, because these are not isolated incidents,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system. \u201d The president cited the nation\u2019s tortured racial history and current statistics on unequal treatment of the races. Sounding wistful, he said, \u201cmaybe in my children\u2019s lifetimes, all the vestiges of that past will have been cured. \u201d Mr. Castile\u2019s deadly encounter with the police occurred Wednesday night at 9 p. m. in the small city of Falcon Heights, just northwest of St. Paul. The graphic video showed Mr. Castile, who had been shot several times, slumping toward the woman who was recording the scene. As she did so, her    daughter sat in the back seat and an officer stood just outside the driver\u2019s side window, still aiming his gun at the mortally wounded man at   range. The video is all the more shocking for the calm, clear narration of the woman, Diamond Reynolds, and the fact that she was streaming it live on Facebook. On the video, Ms. Reynolds, who said Mr. Castile was her boyfriend, gives her account of what happened, saying again and again that he had informed the officer that he was carrying a gun, and that he was just reaching for his driver\u2019s license and registration  \u2014   as the officer had requested  \u2014   when the officer opened fire. She estimated, at various times, that three, four or five shots were fired. \u201cPlease, Officer, don\u2019t tell me that you just did this to him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir. \u201d Ms. Reynolds\u2019s daughter appears several times in the video. Near the end of the   clip, as the two are sitting in the back of a police car and Ms. Reynolds becomes increasingly distraught, the girl comforts her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s O. K. Mommy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s O. K. I\u2019m right here with you. \u201d Late Thursday night, Minnesota authorities identified the officer who fired as Jeronimo Yanez. They said he is on administrative leave as the investigation continues. Another officer who did not shoot but was on the scene is also on leave. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s office ruled Mr. Castile\u2019s manner of death to be a homicide, meaning he was killed by another person. In a short statement, the medical examiner said Mr. Castile sustained multiple gunshot wounds and died at 9:37 p. m. in a hospital emergency room, about 20 minutes after he was shot. Mr. Castile had worked in the nutrition services department of St. Paul Public Schools since 2002, and became a supervisor two years ago, the district said in a statement. In recent years, he worked at J. J. Hill Montessori Magnet School, which is part of the district. \u201cHe was one of the   people you\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Antonio Johnson, a first cousin of Mr. Castile\u2019s. \u201cThis kid has never been in an argument. You could try to argue with him, and he was so nonconfrontational that he\u2019d just laugh. \u201d Danny Givens, a nondenominational pastor who said he was a friend of Mr. Castile\u2019s, said, \u201cPhilando was a very   man,   personable, smile would light up a room, eyes that just speak volumes of love. \u201d In its statement, the school district said: \u201cHe had a cheerful disposition and his colleagues enjoyed working with him. He was quick to greet former   with a smile and hug. \u201d In the day after the shooting, Ms. Reynolds and her video supplied the only public accounts of the lethal encounter. Officials said they could not offer any details, though they did confirm that a gun  \u2014   presumably Mr. Castile\u2019s  \u2014   was recovered from the scene. Mona Dohman, the state commissioner of public safety, who oversees the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, declined to say whether Mr. Castile had a permit to carry a concealed firearm. Mr. Dayton said he was struck by the fact that the video did not show officers making any attempt to render first aid to the dying man, but that they handcuffed Ms. Reynolds and placed her and her daughter in the back of a police car. \u201cThe stark treatment I find just absolutely appalling at all levels,\u201d he said. The video of the shooting passed rapidly among Twitter, Facebook and YouTube users, becoming significant news online. The terms #FalconHeightsShooting and #PhilandoCastile were trending on Twitter as news of the encounter spread. Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter: \u201cAmerica woke up to yet another tragedy of a life cut down too soon. Black Lives Matter. \u201d Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Ms. Reynolds said that Mr. Castile, had just come from having his hair done for his birthday when they were pulled over on Larpenteur Avenue, a major thoroughfare through Falcon Heights, a predominantly white and   city of 5, 500 residents. The two officers who stopped them were from the nearby city of St. Anthony, which provides police services under contract to Falcon Heights, One officer approached Mr. Castile, who was driving, and said he had a broken taillight, Ms. Reynolds said. \u201cHe tells us to put our hands in the air, we have our hands in the air,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the time as our hands is in the air, he asked for license and registration,\u201d which Mr. Castile carried in a wallet in his back pocket. As he is reaching for his back pocket wallet, to produce his license and registration, \u201che lets the officer know, \u2018Officer, I have a firearm on me,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI began to yell, \u2018But he\u2019s licensed to carry.\u2019 After that, he began to take off shots  \u2014   bah, bah, bah, bah, \u2018Don\u2019t move! Don\u2019t move!\u2019 But how can you not move when you\u2019re asking for license and registration? It\u2019s either you want my hands in the air or you want my identification. \u201d The video, some versions of which were reversed, making it appear that Mr. Castile was in the passenger seat, begins with images of Mr. Castile, who appears to be moaning and moving slightly, his left arm and left side bloody. Ms. Reynolds, who uses the name Lavish Reynolds on Facebook, then pans the camera to her face and says    \u201cThey killed my boyfriend. \u201d In the background, one of the officers can be heard shouting: \u201cI told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hands up. \u201d Mr. Castile\u2019s mother, Valerie Castile, told CNN that she had taught her son to be extremely cautious when encountering members of law enforcement. \u201cIf you get stopped by the police, comply,\u201d Ms. Castile said. \u201cComply, comply, comply. \u201d \u201cMy son was a   citizen, and he did nothing wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s no thug. \u201d She added, \u201cI think he was just black in the wrong place. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563235.1598048}
