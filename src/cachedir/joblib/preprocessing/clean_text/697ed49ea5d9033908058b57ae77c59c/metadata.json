As you vote this year you should watch out for these glitches. Sometimes the votes appear to be \u201cflipped\u201d as in a voter intends to vote for Candidate A, but Candidate B\u2019s name is selected on the screen. \\nWhen this happens it is known as \u201cvote flipping,\u201d and is supposed to only happen rarely. With millions of votes cast, there have supposedly only been a few hundred reports of vote flipping every year for the past decade. These are the ones reported so you do wonder whether this happens unnoticed much more often. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m seeing reports of this specifically happening all around the country so cast your vote and double check. Check your ballot after you cast your vote and if it happens to you call on a poll worker to help get it fixed. Remember Voting Machine malfunctions do happen. \\nThere are reports of this happening already in North Carolina, Texas and Nevada with machines vote flipping in the last couple weeks. \\n\u201cYou have to remember that the majority of the machines in use today predate the iPhone or the iPad, and most of them use technology from the late \u201990s,\u201d Lawrence Norden, a voting technology expert at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, told TIME. \u201cAs these machines age, you start to have hardware issues.\u201d \\nOne problem that also occurs on older machines is the glue that attaches the screen to the machine breaks down and you can get alignment issues as well. Poll workers and technicians need to reset the machines regularly to ensure the buttons are lined up right. In other cases, it can just be a user error because no one uses the type of equipment used at the voting centers on a regular basis. \\nIn Texas voters reported attempting to vote a straight Republican ticket, but found the Clinton/Kaine ticket selected instead. This can be found specifically in voting districts where they use the old, rotary-style voting machine. \\nIf you select one candidate and the other appears on the screen or if you\u2019re looking at the summary screen and it just isn\u2019t right voters should notify the poll workers. They can cancel out your session so you can do it over. Poll from PressTV.com 10/28/2016'"}, "time": 1742628374.1053462}
