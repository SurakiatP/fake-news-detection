Native American men and women were given free cookies. \\nAsian women had to pay $1.25, white women 75 cents and Hispanic and African-American women 25 cents. \\nThe club drew heavy scrutiny from a crowd of hundreds, but it insisted that the bake sale was a protest against the \u201cinstitutionalized racism\u201d of affirmative action programs at colleges and universities . Some in the crowd chanted \u201cracists go home.\u201d \\n\u201cOur protest was designed to highlight the insanity of assigning our lives value based on our race and ethnicity, rather than our talents, work ethic and intelligence,\u201d club chairman Vidal Casta\u00f1eda said. \u201cIt is insane that institutional racism, such as affirmative action, continues to allow for universities to judge me by the color of my skin rather than my actions.\u201d Gregory Vincent \\nAccording to the paper, the Young Conservatives of Texas came under fire in 2013 for holding a similar bake sale. The university\u2019s vice president for diversity and community engagement Gregory J. Vincent called that sale \u201cdeplorable.\u201d \\nThis time, Vincent said this bake sale was \u201cinflammatory and demeaning.\u201d \\n\u201cYet focusing our attention on the provocative nature of the YCT\u2019s actions ignores a much more important issue: They create an environment of exclusion and disrespect among our students, faculty and staff ,\u201d he said. \\nHe further questioned the club\u2019s motive behind the bake sale. \u201cIn seeking an audience for their ideas, the YCT resorted to exercising one of the university\u2019s core values to the detriment of others,\u201d he added. \u201cSuch actions are counterproductive to true dialogue on our campus, and it is unrepresentative of the ideals toward which our community strives.\u201d \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742562026.5438774}
