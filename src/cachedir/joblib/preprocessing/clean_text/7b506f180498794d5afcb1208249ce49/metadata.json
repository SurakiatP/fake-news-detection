It\u2019s shocking that while we give law enforcement this extraordinary power, so many states either have no regulation on their books or nothing that complies with international standards,\u201d Hawkins said. \\nWith recent protests in Baltimore and Ferguson, over police killings, there has been an ever-growing spotlight being shined on the culture of policing. \\nAmnesty analyzed each of the 50 U.S state\u2019s statutes regarding use of lethal force. They then compared them against the United Nations accepted principles of only using lethal force \u201cin order to protect life\u201d in \u201cunavoidable\u201d instances after first attempting to utilize \u201cless extreme means.\u201d \\nUN guidelines go on to state that officers should identify themselves and give a clear warning of the intent to use deadly force. \\nThe report found that none of the 50 states met these international standards for using lethal force, stating: \\n\u201cNone of the laws establish the requirement that lethal force may only be used as a last resort with non-violent means and less harmful means to be tried first. The vast majority of laws do not require officers to give a warning of their intent to use firearms.\u201d \\nThe U.S. constitutional standard is less stringent, as set by a 1985 Supreme Court case Tennesse v Garner. The court held that an officer may use deadly force to prevent a suspect from escaping if \u201cthe officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.\u201d \\nEven so, 13 U.S. states failed to meet that constitutional standard, instead choosing to use extremely vague language in their statutes, which can be manipulated to allow for force use well beyond accepted standards. For example, North Dakota allows for deadly force against \u201can individual who has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving violence,\u201d without ever defining what level of violence would warrant lethal force. \\nNine states have absolutely no statutes on the books regarding officer use of lethal force\u2013 Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming \u2013 as well as Washington D.C., meaning that inevitably police investigate themselves based on some arbitrary standard. \\nThe analysis found that only eight states had a requirement of a verbal warning before engaging in the use of deadly force. And in nine states, police can legally use lethal force during a time of rioting. In Pennsylvania, for example, a statute on use of force declares use of lethal force legitimate if \u201cnecessary to suppress a riot or mutiny after the rioters or mutineers have been ordered to disperse.\u201d \\nAmnesty\u2019s report states that in following international standards, all fatal incidents should be mandatorily reported and impartially investigated. The U.S. does no such thing, as the FBI runs a completely voluntary database. \\nAccording The Guardian: \\nThe report also suggests taking action at all levels of government, making recommendations to the president, Congress and the US justice department, along with state legislatures and individual law enforcement departments. Amnesty suggests that laws be brought into compliance with international standards at every level, and that the justice department oversee a national commission \u201cto examine and produce recommendations on policing issues, including a nationwide review of police use of lethal force laws \u2026 as well as a thorough review and reform of oversight and accountability mechanisms\u201d. \\nHawkins went on to say that he expects pushback from the police and their unions, but stated, \u201cwith so much attention on law enforcement and its use of lethal force within the US, in the next legislative session this report will produce some energy for change.\u201d \\nThe push for police accountability is now reaching a fever pitch in the U.S., as the current policing paradigm is unsustainable. With so many great ideas for systemic reform on the table, and so many great minds pushing for accountability, it seems only a matter of time before the current \u201cgood ole boy\u201d power structure comes crumbling down. \\nJay Syrmopoulos is an investigative journalist, free thinker, researcher, and ardent opponent of authoritarianism.
