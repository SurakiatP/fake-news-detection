The source for this gem of information? A satire column written for the New Yorker. [Amir Oren, Haaretz\u2019s senior correspondent, columnist and a member of its editorial board, published a column Sunday entitled \u201cFrom the Passport Stamp Controversy to Trump\u2019s   . \u201d  In it, Oren wrote: Foreign visitors stream to the White House, but there is an embarrassing emptiness there behind the power of Trump\u2019s    adviser, Jared Kushner, who boasted that, while waiting to board ski lifts on vacation, he read up on the Middle East on his smartphone. As blogger Elder of Ziyon noted, the basis of Oren\u2019s claim comes from a hilarious  \u2014   and very     \u2014   column written in the New Yorker by comedian and satirist Andy Borowitz: BAGHDAD (The Borowitz Report)  \u2014   Jared Kushner said on Tuesday that he became \u201cincredibly  \u201d on the Middle East by reading up on the region while waiting for the ski lift on a recent trip to Aspen. \u201cThere would be times when you\u2019d have to wait five or even ten minutes for the ski lift, and that\u2019s when I\u2019d take out my phone and read up on the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cI really got into it. \u201d Kushner said that the Middle East was a \u201ctruly fascinating region\u201d because of \u201call the countries that they have there. \u201d \u201cThere is Israel, and Egypt, but there is also Yemen and places like that,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I would start learning about a new country, but then the ski lift would come. \u201d Kushner said that, during a meeting on Monday in Baghdad, he \u201cwowed\u201d the Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider   with knowledge that he had gleaned about the nation while waiting for the ski lift. \u201cI told him that Iraq\u2019s main agricultural products include wheat, barley, corn, and rice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe seemed really surprised that I would know things like that. \u201d \u201cSomething else that\u2019s interesting about the Middle East is there is a country called Jordan,\u201d he added. Haaretz later updated the aforementioned paragraph to read thusly (emphasis added): Foreign visitors stream to the White House, but there is an embarrassing emptiness there behind the power of Trump\u2019s     Jared Kushner. The senior adviser boasted that (according to reports that some say were satirical) while waiting to board ski lifts on vacation, he read up on the Middle East on his smartphone. Later still the article was updated a third time (it\u2019s worth noting that none of the amendments were mentioned in an disclaimer endnote) this time reading: Foreign visitors stream to the White House, but there is an embarrassing emptiness there behind the power of Trump\u2019s     Jared Kushner. The senior adviser was ridiculed as ostensibly taking a crash course on the Middle East while waiting for ski lifts on vacation. The last sentence hyperlinks to another Haaretz article that has no mention whatsoever of Kushner\u2019s   habits. The   version sticks to amendment number two, perhaps assuming that its readers won\u2019t know or won\u2019t bother to find out who Andy Borowitz is.'"}, "time": 1742628434.0243359}
