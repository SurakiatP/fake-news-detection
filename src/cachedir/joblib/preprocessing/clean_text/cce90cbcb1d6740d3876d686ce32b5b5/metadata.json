He was 74. The current president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, confirmed the death in a Twitter message on Friday. The cause was not immediately known. Mr. Pr\u00e9val was the first  \u2014   and so far only  \u2014   Haitian president to be elected, serve out his term and hand over power to an elected successor, an extraordinary accomplishment in a fragile democracy besieged by decades of turmoil. And he did it twice, serving from 1996 to 2001 and again from 2006 until 2011. A man of quiet demeanor in a country with a politically raucous history, he was best known for what did not happen to him: He was neither assassinated nor overthrown. Indeed, he was regarded as a pragmatic consensus builder. But his reputation was severely bruised after the earthquake, which killed an estimated 100, 000 to 316, 000 people. He was roundly criticized for not reassuring his stunned nation that help was on the way, either from other nations or his own battered government. \u201cAs a person, I was paralyzed,\u201d Mr. Pr\u00e9val told The Los Angeles Times that year. \u201cI was much criticized for not having spoken. \u201d But he added: \u201cTo say what? To the thousands of parents whose children were dead. To the hundreds of schoolchildren I was hearing scream, \u2018Come help me!\u2019 I couldn\u2019t find the words to say to those people. \u201d Ren\u00e9 Garcia Pr\u00e9val was born on Jan. 17, 1943, in    and raised in Marmelade, a town in a mountainous coffee and   region of   Haiti. His father, Claude Jules Pr\u00e9val, was an agronomist and a government official until the family was forced to scatter under the dictatorship of Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, known as Papa Doc. Mr. Pr\u00e9val went to Belgium, where he followed in his father\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s footsteps and studied agronomy at the Gembloux Agricultural University. He later studied geothermal science at the University of Pisa in Italy. In 1970, Mr. Pr\u00e9val moved to Brooklyn, where he worked as a waiter and messenger. He returned to Haiti in 1975. By then it was under the less openly violent, though still authoritarian, rule of Mr. Duvalier\u2019s son,   known as Baby Doc. Mr. Pr\u00e9val worked in   government positions, including in the agency overseeing mining. In 1988, two years after Baby Doc was ousted, Mr. Pr\u00e9val opened a bakery that provided bread to poor children in   \u2019s slums, including in an orphanage run by the charismatic Roman Catholic priest and political activist   Aristide. The bakery would change the direction of Mr. Pr\u00e9val\u2019s life. He and Father Aristide became friends, and Mr. Pr\u00e9val rose in prominence in Father Aristide\u2019s Lavalas movement, which was popular with Haiti\u2019s quickly growing urban poor and fiercely opposed by the country\u2019s tiny ruling elite. After Mr. Aristide became president in 1990, having left the priesthood, he appointed Mr. Pr\u00e9val as his prime minister, placing him in charge of the government\u2019s operations. But the Aristide government lasted only a few months before it was overthrown by the military. The two went into exile. Mr. Pr\u00e9val later returned and was elected president, but he did not have the charisma of his political benefactor, and Mr. Aristide was considered the true power behind his presidency. When peasants asked how they could survive under United States trade policies and soaring fuel prices, he notoriously told them to \u201cswim their way out. \u201d Mr. Pr\u00e9val organized new elections in 2000 that returned Mr. Aristide to power. The ensuing inauguration was a Haitian milestone: Mr. Pr\u00e9val became the first Haitian leader to be freely elected, serve a full constitutional term and then peacefully hand power to a successor. But Mr. Aristide\u2019s term was cut short again in a bloody 2004 coup. Mr. Pr\u00e9val was elected again two years later. Mr. Pr\u00e9val, whose first two marriages ended in divorce, is survived by his wife, Elisabeth Delatour Pr\u00e9val, two daughters, Patricia and Dominique, and two stepsons. It was in his second term that Mr. Pr\u00e9val escaped Mr. Aristide\u2019s shadow and emerged as a force of his own. After breaking with Mr. Aristide, he used his quiet manner and diplomatic charm to encourage the soft support of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. Mr. Pr\u00e9val was never one to stir up the masses with oratory flair, or one to bother stumping on the campaign trail. When the earthquake  \u2014   7. 0 magnitude  \u2014   toppled the capital on Jan. 12, 2010, Mr. Pr\u00e9val did not emerge in public for hours. Reporters later learned that he had spent the night anonymously touring the devastation on the back of a motorcycle. Close associates described him as falling into a state of shock from which he never fully recovered. Jocelerme Privert, a former provisional president who was a member of Mr. Pr\u00e9val\u2019s cabinet and a longtime friend, said Mr. Pr\u00e9val was known for daily 8 a. m. cabinet meetings that actually began on time. He patiently listened to each cabinet member and made decisions by consensus, Mr. Privert said. \u201cHe is not a demagogue, I can say that,\u201d Mr. Privert said by telephone on Friday from   . \u201cHe always believed: If you have to build a bridge, build it. Don\u2019t announce it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563444.3945282}
