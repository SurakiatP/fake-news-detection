Art plastered the walls, plants were hanging from the ceiling, and in every nook there was something to seize a child\u2019s imagination. Some kids were doing cutouts of paper clothing and others were at an easel, painting. A bunch of children were solving puzzles on a computer, while another group was building a pink cardboard chair, which they called \u201cA Chair for My Mother. \u201d In the reading nook a girl was learning about how, when the wasp larva hatches, it eats the spider. Three classmates were playing   trying on old felt hats and checking themselves out in the mirror. The teacher was everywhere  \u2014   praising kids, offering suggestions when they were stumped and, sometimes, peacemaking. Two boys were peering at insects through a microscope when they started fighting over who got to look next. Ms. Rojas deftly diverted them. \u201cHow many parts does an insect body have?\u201d she asked. The boys knew: \u201cThree parts  \u2014   the antenna, abdomen and legs. \u201d \u201cHow about an insect salad  \u2014   would you want to eat it?\u201d she inquired. \u201cUgh,\u201d the boys chorused. \u201cWhy not  \u2014   are they bad for you?\u201d she asked. The boys thought about it. \u201cMaybe if you chopped them up they\u2019d be O. K.,\u201d one volunteered. At that moment I wished that I were 4 years old and could join the festivities. But most   classrooms look entirely different. After surveying preschools nationwide, Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia Curry School of Education, concluded that \u201csuperficial task demands, including giving directions and assigning routine tasks, predominate over children\u2019s involvement in appropriate conceptual or   activities. \u201d A preschool in Chicago that I visited a few years earlier boasted that it was certified by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the   equivalent of the Good Housekeeping seal. But it didn\u2019t merit that encomium. A big room that might once have been a storeroom had been split into   each about 15 feet square, separated by   partitions. Noise reverberated throughout the building. \u201cStay within the lines,\u201d a teacher commanded a    boy. \u201cYou\u2019re not tracing the triangle. \u201d After he started coloring, she returned, exasperated. \u201cYou weren\u2019t paying attention during circle time. Only color the triangles, not the circle or the heart. \u201d The teacher turned to me. \u201cI like the kids when they stay within the lines and color beautiful,\u201d she said. In another class, children were told to paint the bottom section of a pyramid. The directions were the same: Stay within the lines. It turned out that the kids were painting the food pyramid, but they didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what they were doing. What I saw made me wish that I could round up a passel of children and make a run for safety. Deborah Stipek, a professor of education at Stanford, makes the point more bluntly: \u201cWhat I see in a lot of preschools is much worse than coloring between the lines. It\u2019s teachers yelling at kids all day. \u201d These two prekindergartens serve very different populations, but perhaps not the ones you might expect. The \u201cstay within the lines\u201d   enrolls mainly   youngsters, whose parents pay to send them there, while Ms. Rojas\u2019s classroom is in a public school in a poor immigrant community. Though I\u2019ve spent many hours crouching in these classrooms, I\u2019m no expert. What I witnessed should be obvious to any mom or dad. That\u2019s why, even if you are an   parent, you can rapidly determine whether you want to send your child to a particular preschool. You may also be able to save a boatload of money, since public preschools are often as good as their $30, 000 alternatives. When you walk in the door of a prekindergarten, check out the walls  \u2014   they should be festooned with children\u2019s projects, and not, as is too often the case, plastered with posters that are calculated to please adults and mounted too high for    to see. Look around. There should be lots of different things for children to do. If the kids say hello, and quickly return to what they have been doing, that\u2019s a good sign, for it suggests that they\u2019re developing social skills. But if they mob you, you have your answer: This isn\u2019t the place for your child. You might consider yourself to be a fascinating person, but you shouldn\u2019t be more interesting than whatever activity these   and    are engaged in. Is the class   silent? I\u2019ve talked with    parents who equate obedience with quality, but unless you want your child in boot camp, that\u2019s unhealthy. (Of course, running wild isn\u2019t a good thing either that   energy belongs on the playground.) Kids should be quiet, if a bit squirmy, during circle time, when they are gathered around their teacher. But mostly they should be engaged with one another, because that\u2019s when most learning occurs. Their teacher should be talking with them, not at them. And if the classroom looks like a healthy mix of kids from different backgrounds, that\u2019s all to the good. Children learn a lot from their classmates, and kids with different experiences have much to contribute to one another. That\u2019s it, more or less. If you have a chance to talk briefly with the teacher, ask her how she decides to spend time with one group or another. Inquire about how she handles children who haven\u2019t fully learned how, as the argot goes, to use their words, take turns or share. While the answer matters, you mostly want to make sure she has really thought about those things. Winging it doesn\u2019t make for good teaching. I imagine many readers believe that I\u2019ve committed heresy. To them, Montessori or HighScope, Reggio Emilia or Waldorf, or some other school of   pedagogy embodies the Holy Grail. But there\u2019s no reason to believe that one of these is better than the others. The key is how well a particular model of teaching is being carried out. A class can be a joy when the teacher truly understands how properly to use, say, the HighScope approach, which has the children decide what they want to do that day, then tackle the chosen project and later review what they\u2019ve learned. But these techniques are devilishly hard to pull off. When done badly the result is a mighty mess. That\u2019s why the school district in the first example allows the best teachers to design a curriculum that, while borrowing from   approaches, makes the most sense for their kids. For parents, the bottom line is simple: Watch closely what\u2019s happening in the classroom, pick a preschool that you wish you had gone to, and your child will do just fine.'"}, "time": 1742562299.5320745}
