(Image via aisfm.edu.in) \\nGoswami\u2019s loud, hard-hitting voice, one of the main reasons behind The Newshour\u2019s catapult to dominance, will now be played in The Newshour studios, while the makeshift anchors move their lips to his statements. According to senior Times Now journalist Navika Kumar, their usual stand-in Newshour anchor Anand Narasimhan has been spending sleepless nights, hard at work, trying to move his lips to Arnab\u2019s audio flawlessly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a while before Rahul Shivshankar joins us and does a more believable and buy-able impression of Arnab, but until then, we\u2019ve got to do this much at least,\u201d Navika told The UnReal Times . \\nNarasimhan has admitted to finding this task the most difficult thing he\u2019s ever had to do in life. \u201cTo open your throat and try to scream the loudest, yet without screaming, to keep interrupting people correctly before they finish a couple of words, to keep uttering that you would bring in some panelist in to the debate and yet not bring him, to keep announcing ever 5 minutes that you would open the phone lines and yet not open them..Whew! This is as Herculean as it can get. I expect to be featured on Ripley\u2019s Believe it or not, if at all I\u2019m able to achieve this dubsmashing feat,\u201d the anchor described, before going ahead to practice moving his lips to \u201cTHE NATION WANTS TO KNOW!\u201d \\nNavika also added that the crew has a backup plan in place, should the dubsmashing go awry. \u201cIn the worst case, if no one is able to lip sync properly, we will try to get Dr. Manmohan Singh to do the job. He doesn\u2019t have to dubsmash, he might as well speak and we can have Arnab\u2019s voice as the voiceover,\u201d the senior journalist added. The channel, however, soon had a reason to cheer, as Bollywood actor Anupam Kher volunteered to act as Arnab for free. \u201cDubsmashing Arnab is the least I can do for my country and our soldiers at the border. It is a role that I would be proud and privileged to accept, all for the sake of the jawans,\u201d Kher exclaimed. \\nThe move has, however, come in for sharp criticism from the channel\u2019s bete noire s. \u201cDubsmash => Dumb smash. Enough said :)\u201d tweeted Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha. The last word though, went to AAP spokesperson The Ashutosh. \u201cWhy the Times Now sud depend on lip sinking the Arnab\u2019s voice !!! Will the Modi answer !!!\u201d (sic) the former IBN7 editor tweeted.
