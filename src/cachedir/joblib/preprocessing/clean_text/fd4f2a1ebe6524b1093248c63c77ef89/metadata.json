What becomes clearly obvious is that when war is sought by the powers that be, and the powers that profit from death and destruction, the propaganda machine goes into full demonization mode. As can be seen in the show, the people of Iran are warm, wonderful people, just like Americans, who simply wish to live their lives in peace, and would likely be much happier if not for the horrible government they have to live under (just like Americans \u2013 and I am not distinguishing between democrat and republican in my condemnation \u2013 they are BOTH THE SAME). When war is sought, EVERY member of the target group becomes Hitler or worse. The same was done with the Japanese, the Germans, the Italians, and for decades the Soviets. But really, who is the most horrible of the horrible in any society? The government of course. But the government is RARELY the target of the bombs, the missiles, or the occupation and destruction. But hey, they\u2019re just Huns, Gooks, Chinks, Japs, Rag heads, sand niggers, camel jockies, etc\u2026\u2026right??? So who cares how many of them get blown to pieces. Well of course that is how Halliburton, Lockeed, the banksters, the Military-Industrial-Congressional complex, etc. want you to think, and thankfully the boot-licking compliant mainstream media is more than happy to paint whatever horrible picture of the country as is needed to engender those feelings.
