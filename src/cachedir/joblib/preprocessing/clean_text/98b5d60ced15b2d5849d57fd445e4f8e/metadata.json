[Officials took down one website that appeared to contradict EPA administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s statements on climate change and removed another that provided information about the Clean Power Plan, an initiative of the Obama administration, the Washington Post reported.  \u201cAs EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land, and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,\u201d J. P. Freire, the agency\u2019s associate administrator for public affairs, said in a statement. \u201cWe want to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we\u2019re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law. \u201d The agency also said it would archive pages from the previous administration. The climate change website now redirects to a page that says that \u201cthis page is being updated\u201d and that \u201cwe are currently updating our website to reflect EPA\u2019s priorities under the leadership of President Trump and Administrator Pruitt. \u201d The page also links to an archive of how the web page looked on January 19, the day before Trump\u2019s inauguration. Pruitt reportedly approved the changes to the EPA\u2019s website, according to a staffer who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity. The staffer also added that Pruitt\u2019s aides \u201cfound a number of instances\u201d where the information on the EPA\u2019s website contradicted the policies of the administration. EPA sources told Reuters in January that administration officials asked the agency to take down the climate change page, but EPA staff fought to keep the page up.'"}, "time": 1742563809.398509}
