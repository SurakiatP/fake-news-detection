Arrigo, a biological oceanographer at Stanford University. But the menu is changing. Confirming earlier research, scientists reported Wednesday that global warming is altering the ecology of the Arctic Ocean on a huge scale. The annual production of algae, the base of the food web, increased an estimated 47 percent between 1997 and 2015, and the ocean is greening up much earlier each year. These changes are likely to have a profound impact for animals further up the food chain, such as birds, seals, polar bears and whales. But scientists still don\u2019t know enough about the biology of the Arctic Ocean to predict what the ecosystem will look like in decades to come. While global warming has affected the whole planet in recent decades, nowhere has been hit harder than the Arctic. This month, temperatures in the high Arctic have been as much as 36 degrees above average, according to records kept by the Danish Meteorological Institute. In October, the extent of sea ice was 28. 5 percent below average  \u2014   the lowest for the month since scientists began keeping records in 1979. The area of missing ice is the size of Alaska and Texas put together. Since the   researchers like Dr. Arrigo have been trying to assess the effects of retreating ice on the Arctic ecosystem. The sun returns to the Arctic each spring and melts some of the ice that formed in winter. Algae in the open water quickly spring to life and start growing. These algae are the base of the food chain in the Arctic Ocean, grazed by krill and other invertebrates that in turn support bigger fish, mammals and birds. Dr. Arrigo and his colleagues visited the Arctic in research ships to examine algae in the water and to determine how it affected the water\u2019s color. They then reviewed satellite images of the Arctic Ocean, relying on the color of the water to estimate how much algae was growing  \u2014   what scientists call the ocean\u2019s productivity. The sea\u2019s productivity was rapidly increasing, Dr. Arrigo found. Last year he and his colleagues published their latest update, estimating that the productivity of the Arctic rose 30 percent between 1998 and 2012. But Mati Kahru, an oceanographer at the University of California, San Diego, was skeptical. As an expert on remote sensing, he knew how hard it is to get a reliable picture of the Arctic Ocean. The ocean is notoriously cloudy, and algae are not the only thing that tinting the water. Rivers deliver   organic matter into the Arctic Ocean, which can give the impression that there\u2019s more algae in the water than is actually there. Dr. Kahru and his colleagues decided to take an independent look, scouring satellite databases for images taken from 1997 to 2015  \u2014   \u201cevery image available,\u201d he said. The scientists used a mathematical equation to determine how the color in each pixel of each image was determined by algae, runoff, and other factors. Dr. Kahru decided that Dr. Arrigo was right: The Arctic Ocean has become vastly more productive. Marcel Babin, an oceanographer at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec who was not involved in the new study, said that the researchers had done \u201cvery careful work\u201d that confirmed the earlier studies. \u201cIt\u2019s an important finding,\u201d he said. Not only is the Arctic Ocean producing more algae, but it\u2019s doing so sooner each year. \u201cThese blooms are coming earlier, sometimes two months earlier,\u201d Dr. Kahru said. In fact, the bloom may be coming even sooner than satellites can record. On research cruises, Dr. Arrigo and his colleagues have found that open water is no longer a requirement for algae to grow. The ice has gotten so thin that sunlight reaches through it. \u201cNow they\u2019re not even waiting for the ice to melt,\u201d said Dr. Arrigo said of algal organisms. If we stay on our current course, pouring more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the Arctic will only get warmer, perhaps becoming   in the summer. If algae can find more nitrogen and other nutrients in the ocean, its productivity may continue to rise. Scientists can\u2019t yet say what the ecological effects of this transformation will be. \u201cIt is probable it will have an impact on the whole food web,\u201d Dr. Babin said. Dr. Babin and his colleagues have been studying that impact over the past two summers on an expedition called the Green Edge Project, which has studied the ecology in Baffin Bay off the coast of northern Canada. They hope to present the first results of the survey next year. Some species may thrive because they can graze on the extra algae. But if the ecosystem comes to life earlier in the year, many species may be left behind. Fish larvae may not be able to develop fast enough. Migrating whales and birds may show up too late. A lot of the extra algae may drop to the sea floor by then, untouched. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different Arctic unless we turn things around,\u201d said Dr. Arrigo.'"}, "time": 1742562238.657288}
