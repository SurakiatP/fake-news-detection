They talked about the importance of the election tomorrow. They remarked that the Clinton campaign makes baseless accusations that the Russians could hack our voting machines to manipulate the election, but then insisting that Trump is beyond the pale for suggesting that the Hillary forces could possibly rig the vote. \\nThey also talked about New York Times columnist David Brooks admission on the PBS News Hour that as a result of globalization, immigration, and feminism, white men in America have been \u201cdisplaced,\u201d\u201cshafted,\u201d and \u201cruined,\u201d and that their support for Trump is due to them \u201cgoing with their gene pool.\u201d Brooks, a Jewish Republican, says the one person he cannot support for President is Donald Trump. \\nAnd now, a message from Andrew Anglin: \\nMeanwhile, the media is admitting that voting machines will be hacked . \\nWe have to overwhelm the polls tomorrow. You must get everyone you know to vote . Call them right now. Don\u2019t wait. Go through your phonebook on your cellphone and call up every single person you know who is not a totally liberal commie, and make sure they are going to vote. Offer to give them a ride if they need it. \\nLet\u2019s do this, people. \\nImmediately following the show Dr. Duke got an mailbox full of emails saying this was the most powerful and inspiring radio broadcast they ever heard! Spread it around. \\n\\nOur show is aired live at 11 am replayed at ET 4pm Eastern and 4am Eastern. \\nClick on Image to Donate! \\nAnd please spread this message to others.'"}, "time": 1742562649.1845617}
