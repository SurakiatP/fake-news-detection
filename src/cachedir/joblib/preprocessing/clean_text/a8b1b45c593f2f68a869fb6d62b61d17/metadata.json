He was 22. [Warmbier, who returned to America last Tuesday, having previously been sentenced to 15 years hard labor after stealing   paraphernalia from his hotel, had lapsed into a coma before his return. The North Korean government claimed Warmbier had contracted botulism shortly after his conviction of crimes against the communist state in March 2016.  Doctors treating Warmbier upon his return to Ohio stated, however, that they found no evidence of botulism, instead finding \u201cextensive brain damage. \u201d The North Korean government has not remarked on the discrepancy or provided any explanation for what could have caused Warmbier such brain damage in prison. \u201cIt is our sad duty to report that our son, Otto Warmbier, has completed his journey home,\u201d his family wrote in a statement. \u201cWe would like to thank the wonderful professionals at Cincinnati Medical Center who did everything they could for Otto. Unfortunately, the awful torturous treatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today. \u201d Otto Warmbier,    US student detained in North Korea, dies after returning home in coma pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 19, 2017,  According to the Warmbier family, Otto was \u201cunable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands. \u201d Warmbier had gone to North Korea in early 2016 on an adventure tour of the rogue state, under the auspices of the   Young Pioneer Tours, which preys on the curiosity of young westerners by offering \u201cBudget tours to destinations your mother wants you to stay away from!\u201d Warmbier was arrested during his visit for allegedly having attempted to steal a communist propaganda sign and forced to confess to the \u201cserious crime\u201d on North Korean television in February 2016. Warmbier pleaded guilty to taking down a political sign from a   area of his hotel. \u201cI have made the worst mistake of my life, but please act to save me,\u201d he said at the time. Under duress, Warmbier accused the United States of bribing him to steal the sign, calling it \u201cthe worst mistake of my life. \u201d  In an appearance carefully choreographed by North Korean authorities, Warmbier said that although his crime was \u201cvery severe and \u201d he was grateful for the regime\u2019s \u201chumanitarian treatment of severe criminals. \u201d Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for his \u201ccrime. \u201d North Korea continues to imprison three other U. S. citizens: academics Kim   and Tony Kim, and businessman Kim  . Update: President Donald Trump has released a statement on Warmbier\u2019s passing: Melania and I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Otto Warmbier on his untimely passing. There is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life. Our thoughts and prayers are with Otto\u2019s family and friends, and all who loved him. Otto\u2019s fate deepens my Administration\u2019s determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency. The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim.'"}, "time": 1742628372.7723887}
