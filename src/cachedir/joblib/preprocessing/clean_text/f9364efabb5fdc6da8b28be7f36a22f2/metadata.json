[Nomani went public with her voting decision in a Washington Post  . She explained she was a \u201c   a Muslim, an immigrant woman \u2018of color\u2019\u201d who became a \u201csilent voter for Donald Trump,\u201d and she made it clear she was not motivated by bigotry or a desire for \u201cwhite supremacism. \u201d Her stated reasons for voting for Trump included the damaging effects of Obamacare and concern about the rise of Islamist extremism worldwide.  She was immediately accused of bigotry and facilitating white supremacism after publishing her article, with one former colleague insulting her as a \u201cclueless dolt\u201d and questioning her humanity.  \u201cYou all were kind enough to write a piece from my experience since my election vote, in which a former colleague at Georgetown University, a professor in the Department of Peace and Security Studies, told me to \u2018eff off and go to hell\u2019 because of my vote,\u201d she recalled.  \u201cIt became a window for me into not just my dynamics with this one individual, but this phenomena that you\u2019re talking about, of the intolerance of the   Left. I was just shocked,\u201d Nomani told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. \u201cI have to say, I\u2019m naive in a bit, and I really believed the arguments of those who are liberal, saying that they are all about peace and love and tolerance, and didn\u2019t really understand this distinction with the dangerous Left, as you\u2019re identifying,\u201d she said. \u201cI have also gone back in my own analysis and come to the same identity issue of feeling like there\u2019s important principles of liberalism that are significant, but the Left has, unfortunately, hijacked liberals in America and created this intolerance,\u201d she warned.
