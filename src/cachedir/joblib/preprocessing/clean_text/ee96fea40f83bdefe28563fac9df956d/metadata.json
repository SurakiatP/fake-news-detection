Rivera, who has had some heated   on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show over the past decade on the issue of immigration, acknowledged that elections have consequences, therefore he doesn\u2019t oppose the wall  \u2014   despite thinking it was a waste of money. \u201cI\u2019m going to shock you. I am withdrawing my opposition to the wall,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cNo, listen, elections have consequences. This was his signature issue, and if the people want the wall, which I think is a waste of money. \u201d \u201cGeraldo is down with the wall now,\u201d O\u2019Reilly replied. \u201cAnd you know, I think you should have a piece full wall   \u2026     sponsored by Geraldo. You could have your picture there. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a $  wall and a $25 ladder and the ladder will triumph,\u201d Rivera added.
