The icy partnership between President Trump and his intelligence chiefs hit a new low. The F. B. I. director, James Comey, confirmed that his agency was investigating Russian meddling in the election and Moscow\u2019s relationship to the Trump campaign, placing a criminal investigation at the doorstep of the White House. He also said he had no information to support Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that former President Barack Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped. _____ 2. During an evening rally in Kentucky, Mr. Trump delivered a rollicking speech that drew deeply on the core themes of his campaign. He made clear that the Republican bill to replace the Affordable Care Act would have to be changed to make it through Congress. But he appeared unconcerned about the ultimate outcome. \u201cWe\u2019re going to negotiate it\u2019s going to go back and forth,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s going to be great. \u201d On Capitol Hill, a group of   in the House, known as the Freedom Caucus, may pose the greatest threat to the bill\u2019s passage. House leaders trying to lock down the votes of upstate New York Republicans inserted a   provision  \u2014   that would apply to New York only  \u2014   to shift Medicaid costs from its counties to the state government. _____ 3. Senate confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, began with ferocious attacks from Democrats. Time is of the essence for Republicans who want him to take his seat this term. The court\u2019s last scheduled arguments are set for the second half of April  \u2014   and the Senate leaves for a   break on April 7. _____ 4. Turkey has its hands full, facing war, terrorist insurgencies, a refugee crises and a widening crackdown on dissent. In the second installment of our series \u201cState of Emergency,\u201d our correspondent visits an imprisoned journalist\u2019s wife, above, and meets a loyalist who took a bullet  \u2014   literally  \u2014   for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. _____ 5. \u201cBrexit\u201d got an official start date: March 29. That\u2019s when the British government says it will formally notify the European Union of its intention to withdraw, setting off a process that should be completed in about two years. _____ 6. It\u2019s officially spring, but weeks without snow or rain  \u2014   and temperatures scraping 80 degrees  \u2014   are raising the threats of fire in the West. On Sunday, about 1, 000 homes around Boulder, Colo. were evacuated as a wildfire in the dry hills, above, burned out of control. Such   wildfires have ravaged areas across Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle, leaving cattle ranchers facing crippling losses and years of cleanup. _____ 7. David Rockefeller, who as the head of Chase Manhattan bank spread the gospel of American capitalism around the world, died at 101. He was the last surviving grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of the Standard Oil Company and America\u2019s first billionaire. As an heir to that legacy, Mr. Rockefeller lived in baronial splendor and privilege. As a boy, he and his brothers would   along Fifth Avenue trailed by a limousine, in case they grew tired. _____ 8. Cystic fibrosis patients in Canada outlive their counterparts in the U. S. by a decade. The most significant difference between them? Health insurance: Canada has a   system. Above, a newborn being tested for it. _____ 9. Scientists might soon be able to revive the woolly mammoth, or some version of it, by splicing genes from ancient mammoths into Asian elephant DNA. But doing so would be expensive and difficult  \u2014   and Asian and African elephants are at risk of extinction themselves. The question scientists are debating now: Should society devote its limited resources to reversing past wrongs, or on preventing future extinctions? _____ 10. Thanks to an aggressive push by streaming services, we\u2019re in something of a golden age for comedians. Netflix\u2019s deals with Dave Chappelle, above, and Chris Rock have received most of the attention, but our comedy writer says that what\u2019s particularly exciting is all the new work from young comics. Here are the top five to watch right now. _____ 11. Finally, as if the F. B. I. weren\u2019t busy enough: Tom Brady\u2019s missing Super Bowl jersey was found in Mexico. A trail of clues led agents to Mauricio Ortega, the editor of La Prensa, a   daily in Mexico City, who had a media credential for the Super Bowl. Confronted, he turned over not only that missing jersey but also a Brady jersey from the 2015 Super Bowl and a helmet thought to belong to Von Miller of the Denver Broncos, (not Vonn, as we wrote earlier) M. V. P. of last year\u2019s Super Bowl. Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
