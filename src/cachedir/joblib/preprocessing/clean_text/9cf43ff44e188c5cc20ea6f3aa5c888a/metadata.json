Trump. He grabbed his phone, turned the lens on himself and pressed record. \u201cHa! Donald,\u201d Mr. Fox said, holding the phone perhaps a little too close to his face. \u201cWhat about your apologies to Mexico, to Mexicans in the United States, to Mexicans in Mexico?\u201d In short order, the   clip was on Mr. Fox\u2019s Twitter feed  \u2014   another salvo in a personal campaign against the American presidential candidate that has included television appearances, radio interviews and a fusillade of hectoring Twitter posts. Mr. Fox\u2019s voice is among a growing, if uncoordinated, chorus of influential Mexicans worried about what a Trump victory could mean for the complex relationship between the United States and Mexico  \u2014   not to mention the impact Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid may have already had. The voices have included at least two former Mexican presidents, top government officials, political analysts, academics, editorial writers and cultural figures. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto likened the candidate\u2019s language to that of Hitler and Mussolini in an interview with Mexico\u2019s Excelsior newspaper. And he recently shuffled his diplomatic corps in the United States, replacing Mexico\u2019s ambassador to Washington and installing new consuls general around the country, in part to strengthen his administration\u2019s response to the rise of Mr. Trump and what it reflects about American sentiment toward Mexico. While many leaders around the world are worried about how Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, win or lose, could shape American foreign policy, the concerns are particularly pointed in Mexico and throughout the Mexican diaspora because of the exceptionally close geographic, economic, demographic and cultural ties between the two countries. The two countries are now enjoying one of the more harmonious periods in a turbulent history. But many in Mexico fear that the friendship would rupture should Mr. Trump win the election and follow through on his threats to undo the North American Free Trade Agreement, force Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall between the countries by interrupting remittances and deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, about half of whom are Mexican. \u201cHis threat is cataclysmic, I think, for Mexico,\u201d Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian and literary magazine editor, said in an interview. \u201cWhat it would mean for bilateral trade, in social terms, in the tearing of families, in the trauma, the collective panic, the opening of old wounds. \u201d He added: \u201cI can use one of Trump\u2019s favorite words. Yes, this is huge. It\u2019s a huge danger. \u201d Mexican critics of Mr. Trump say he has already damaged the image of their country and of the Mexican people with his espousal of views that many regard as xenophobic. At a rally to kick off his campaign in June, the Republican candidate suggested that many Mexican immigrants were drug traffickers and rapists. Mexican officials, concerned about negative impressions of Mexico in the United States, have been rolling out a strategy to improve the image of their country and show how the relationship between the two nations has been of \u201cmutual benefit,\u201d said Paulo Carre\u00f1o, the newly appointed under secretary for North America in Mexico\u2019s Foreign Ministry. The strategy includes \u201ccultural diplomacy,\u201d   activism and the deployment of Mexican community and business leaders living in the United States, he said. As part of the strategy, the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration shook up its diplomatic corps in the United States last month: The Mexican ambassador to Washington, Miguel Bas\u00e1\u00f1ez Ebergenyi, who had been in the job less than a year, was abruptly replaced by Carlos Sada Solana, a veteran diplomat. In addition, 26 consulates changed leadership. A statement from the Foreign Ministry announcing Mr. Sada\u2019s appointment emphasized his experience \u201cprotecting the rights of Mexicans in North America, as well as defending the interests of Mexican abroad. \u201d In addition, a few   government officials have reacted publicly to Mr. Trump, including Humberto Roque Villanueva, the Interior Ministry\u2019s under secretary for population, migration and migratory affairs. He told the newspaper El Universal this month that the Mexican government was analyzing \u201chow to confront what we would call the Trump emergency. \u201d \u201cI believe Mr. Trump speaks off the top of his head and doesn\u2019t have a clear idea about financial matters or international accords,\u201d he added. \u201cWe live in a globalized world. The United States would have to return to a kind of Middle Ages to prohibit remittances or charge tariffs that aren\u2019t charged in other parts of the world. \u201d In general, however, the administration has mostly refrained from commenting on the candidate. That has frustrated many Mexicans, who have called on the government to come to the defense of Mexico and push back at Mr. Trump more forcefully. \u201cThey can package that in the traditional Mexican nonsense: We don\u2019t interfere in elections,\u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former foreign minister. \u201cThe real reason is that they have no idea what to do, so the default option is to do nothing. \u201d Instead, most of the Mexican agitation against Mr. Trump has come from the general public. At the beginning of his campaign, many Mexicans viewed Mr. Trump with a mixture of alarm and amusement. But the amusement has mostly fallen away. \u201cWhy should we worry?\u201d Mr. Krauze asked, rhetorically. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a reason not to worry, no?\u201d In the fall, Mr. Krauze and Carmelo   an emeritus professor of economics and Latin American studies at the University of Pittsburgh, drafted a letter denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.   prominent Latinos  \u2014   academics, scientists, writers and filmmakers in the United States, Spain and Latin America  \u2014   signed it. \u201cHis hate speech appeals to lower passions like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism,\u201d the letter said. In recent months, Mr. Casta\u00f1eda has been pushing a   social media campaign with the hashtag #ImProudToBeMexican. Aiming at an American,   audience, he has uploaded videos to Facebook and a campaign website extolling the diversity of the Mexican diaspora and its contributions to the United States. Explaining the American focus of this lobby, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to convince Mexicans how nasty Trump is, because everyone knows that. That\u2019s a done deal. \u201d Mr. Fox\u2019s drumbeat of harangues against Mr. Trump began in February when he declared in a television interview, using a forceful expletive, that Mexicans would not build the candidate\u2019s proposed wall. He escalated from there, chiding Mr. Trump with language that sometimes devolved into schoolyard churlishness. He called the candidate \u201ca false prophet,\u201d \u201cdictator\u201d and \u201closer. \u201d He posted a selfie taken against the backdrop of a beach with this message: \u201cTrump, this beautiful Cancun. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE. \u201d He posted photos from his wife\u2019s birthday party, taunting Mr. Trump: \u201cWhat do you know about love? Or you just know about hating. How sad!\u201d This month, Mr. Fox expressed contrition for some of his comments in an interview with Breitbart News and apologized to Mr. Trump. But amid blowback from Mexicans on social media and elsewhere who accused him of weakness, he resumed his badgering, posting photos on social media of a   tie made in China and a   jacket made in Mexico  \u2014   evidence, he said, of the candidate\u2019s hypocrisy. Mr. Fox said in a telephone interview from his home in Guanajuato State that he was motivated to attack Mr. Trump by what he called \u201cpure love for that great nation, the United States. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the American public is buying this,\u201d he continued, pain in his voice. \u201cWe are partners, we are neighbors, and we should be friends. He\u2019s dividing not only American society, but he\u2019s dividing two nations. \u201cWhy does he pick on Mexico?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561932.587796}
