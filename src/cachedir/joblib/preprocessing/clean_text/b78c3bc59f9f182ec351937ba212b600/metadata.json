He served 13 months of an 18-year prison term before being released. \\nIn the affidavit, Johnson also mentions that Trump threatened her life. \\nThe alleged victim\u2019s accounts are corroborated by two witnesses (identified in court records as \u201cJoan Doe\u201d and \u201cTiffany Doe\u201d), who allegedly worked as \u201cparty planners\u201d for Epstein. \\n\u201cI personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop,\u201d Tiffany Doe alleges . \\nTiffany Doe also claimed to have witnessed Trump force Jane Doe and an unidentified 12-year-old girl (identified in court records as Maria) to perform oral sex on him, then continue to physically abuse the girls after the act concluded. \\nIn court documents, Tiffany Doe said that part of her job was to \u201cpersonally witness and supervise encounters between the underage girls that Mr. Epstein hired and his guests.\u201d \\nAccording to the former \u201cparty planner,\u201d both Trump and Epstein threatened Jane Doe if she ever revealed what they had done. They used Maria\u2019s disappearance as collateral that they would make good on their threat, implying that they had the girl murdered. \\n\u201cI personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn\u2019t ever say anything if she didn\u2019t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed,\u201d Tiffany Doe alleged. \\nWhen Tiffany Doe stopped working for Epstein in 2002, she said the billionaire threatened to kill her and her family if she ever came forward about his activities. \\n\u201cI fully understand that that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger,\u201d she said. \\nA federal judge has ordered a hearing concerning Johnson\u2019s case to be held on December 16. \\nFeatured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742561909.6798508}
