And then President Trump began talking and the plan went out the window. Unless that was the plan all along. When Mr. Trump sat down with television anchors at the White House for an    lunch on Tuesday, he was supposed to preview his first address to Congress. Instead, he suddenly opened the door to an immigration bill that would potentially let millions of undocumented immigrants stay in the country legally. Such legislation from the \u201cbuild the wall\u201d president would roil politics in the capital, and Mr. Trump told the anchors that nothing like that was actually in the speech as it was then drafted. But he turned to aides and suggested that maybe they should include it. After the lunch was over, aides rushed off to alert their colleagues, including Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller, the architects of the president\u2019s immigration crackdown. Once again, the unlikeliest of presidents had torn up the script and thrown his young administration into upheaval. Once again, Washington was left trying to fathom what his strategy was. Was it mad genius, an improvisational leader proposing a     move to overhaul immigration after making a point of deporting \u201cbad hombres\u201d? Or was it simply madness, an undisciplined political amateur unable to resist telling guests what he thinks they want to hear even at the expense of his own political base? In the end, he did not include it in the speech. And yet, rising to the occasion, Mr. Trump on Tuesday night sounded as presidential as he ever has since taking office. He invoked Abraham Lincoln and Dwight D. Eisenhower, heralded Black History Month, condemned   vandalism, celebrated American entrepreneurs like Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison, and promised a \u201crenewal of the American spirit. \u201d He followed the written text on the teleprompters more closely than any major speech of his presidency. Still, the paradox remained. He called for working \u201cpast the differences of party,\u201d just hours after he called Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader from California, \u201cincompetent. \u201d He declared that \u201cthe time for trivial fights is behind us\u201d just weeks after engaging in a public Twitter war with Arnold Schwarzenegger over the ratings for \u201cCelebrity Apprentice. \u201d And then there was that immigration trial balloon. If nothing else, Donald Trump the showman kept the attention right where he wanted it  \u2014   squarely on himself. By the time he took the rostrum in the House chamber on Tuesday night for the functional equivalent of a State of the Union address, he had generated considerable suspense around what he would actually say and how it would be received. He boasted of deporting \u201cgang members, drug dealers and criminals,\u201d saying that \u201cbad ones are going out as I speak. \u201d He introduced guests in the first lady\u2019s box whose families had suffered at the hands of criminals in the country illegally. But he talked about \u201creforming our system of legal immigration,\u201d saying as he has before that the United States should base its admission of foreigners on merit. \u201cI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible as long as we focus on the following goals,\u201d he added, \u201cto improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security and to restore respect for our laws. \u201d Whether this was all an intentional distraction remained unclear by the time he wrapped up and headed back down Pennsylvania Avenue. This is, after all, a White House that revels in what its current occupants refer to as the \u201chead fake,\u201d where the president gives the impression of moving one way when he is really moving in a completely different direction, even diverting attention from one controversy by creating another. That leaves allies and adversaries alike scratching their heads about what Mr. Trump really believes. In private discussions since the inauguration, a mystified Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader from Kentucky, has said that Mr. Trump appears uncertain of precisely where he stands on a number of critical issues. Thus, aides, activists, lobbyists and lawmakers search for ways to influence a malleable president, who sometimes plays along with his team\u2019s desire to confuse and distract, but who is also prone to spouting out    ideas depending on his audience. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have said privately that they wanted this opening speech to Congress to be more optimistic than the address he delivered at his inauguration in January, an   jeremiad against what he called \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d and the establishment he blamed for it. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump has privately expressed concern about the harsh tone of some of her father\u2019s rhetoric over many months. No president in modern times had shown up for his first speech to Congress with approval ratings so low  \u2014   just 42 percent in the latest Gallup poll. His 40 days of careening from one crisis to another, many of them   had sowed deep doubts about his leadership not only among Democrats and independents but even among many Republicans. His challenge for this address was to move beyond these moments and establish himself as a president. Immigration has been one area where he was evidently still trying to calibrate. After all, Mr. Trump was not always so strident on the issue. After the 2012 election, he denounced Mitt Romney for supporting what he called \u201c\u201d calling it \u201ca crazy policy\u201d that cost Mr. Romney the Hispanic vote. The Democrats, he said then, did not have a policy \u201cbut what they did have going for them is they weren\u2019t meanspirited about it. \u201d The session with the television anchors started out as a nod to tradition by a president who has broken so many. Like his predecessors on the day of a State of the Union address, Mr. Trump hosted the journalists for what was supposed to be an unrecorded lunch to give them a sense of what he would tell Congress. But the conversation took a surprising turn when some of the anchors asked about his efforts to deport many of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Without being prompted, Mr. Trump then raised the idea of legislation, noting that there had not been any comprehensive law passed by Congress on the subject since Ronald Reagan\u2019s amnesty program in the 1980s. He told the anchors it was time for a bill that would grant legal status to many of those in the country illegally as long as both sides compromised, similar to the legislation sought but never passed by George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Mr. Trump said he recognized that it would cause him political problems with his conservative base voters, according to people in the room, but added that he thought he could keep them happy since they had stuck with him throughout last year\u2019s Republican primaries. When Mr. Trump offered the idea, he let the word \u201ccompromise\u201d hang in the air, gauging the reaction. He then turned to Hope Hicks, his director of strategic communications, and suggested that the thought could be added to his speech. As Mr. Trump\u2019s words settled over the State Dining Room, the president\u2019s aides glanced at one another. They moved quickly to alert Mr. Bannon and Mr. Miller, two of the main keepers of Mr. Trump\u2019s address before Congress. That the proposal did not ultimately make it into the speech may speak to the influence of Mr. Bannon\u2019s wing. But the town was confused and off balance, just the way Mr. Trump likes it.'"}, "time": 1742628353.1620498}
