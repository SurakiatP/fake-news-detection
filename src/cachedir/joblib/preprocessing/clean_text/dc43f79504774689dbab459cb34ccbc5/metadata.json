Golic said the fans, who were removed from the stadium, should be publicly outed along with their quotes for everybody to see. \u201cWhat kind of idiot are you to do something like that?\u201d Golic scolded. \u201cThe way I look at it, you\u2019re yelling that out publicly to somebody, I wish you would be publicly outed. I wish your face would be somewhere and with the quote of what you said right under your face publicly for everybody to see since you feel the need to yell something about someone. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742563123.890201}
