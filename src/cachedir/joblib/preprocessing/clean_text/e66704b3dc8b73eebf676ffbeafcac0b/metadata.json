And increasingly, they happen onstage  \u2014   in fictional tragedies and verbatim dramas that explore the psychology of the shooters and the consequences for the affected individuals and communities. The past several years have seen Jessica Dickey\u2019s \u201cThe Amish Project\u201d Stephen Karam and PJ Paparelli\u2019s \u201ccolumbinus\u201d Simon Stephens\u2019s \u201cPunk Rock\u201d Scott Z. Burns\u2019s \u201cThe Library\u201d David Greig\u2019s \u201cThe Events\u201d Julia Cho\u2019s \u201cOffice Hour\u201d Rajendra Ramoon Maharaj, Adam Mace and Christian Lee Branch\u2019s \u201cMother Emanuel\u201d and a host of    \u2014   each instigated by one or more instances of gun violence. This month brings three new plays inspired by the 2012 events in Newtown, Conn. in which a man opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 26 children and adults before taking his own life. Eric Ulloa\u2019s \u201c26 Pebbles,\u201d presented by the Human Race Theater Company in Dayton, Ohio, is a documentary drama in the style of Tectonic Theater Project\u2019s \u201cThe Laramie Project. \u201d Mr. Ulloa, an actor turned writer, based the play on the more than 60 interviews he did with Newtown residents. By contrast, Mart\u00edn Zimmerman\u2019s \u201cOn the Exhale\u201d and Courtney Baron\u2019s \u201cWhen It\u2019s You\u201d use the Newtown catastrophe as a stimulus for anguished fictions. Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s play, which opens on Sunday at the Roundabout Underground, is a monologue voiced by a nameless literature professor who finds herself fixated on a weapon used in a mass shooting. Ms. Baron\u2019s piece, a Keen Company production that begins performances on Feb. 28 and is also a solo show, uses a multiple murder to meditate on what we owe to one another. The New York Times spoke to these writers about representing gun violence onstage and their own experiences with firearms. These are edited excerpts from the conversations. What inspired your play? I was tired of my own complacency whenever something horrific happens that I can\u2019t understand, this being a traumatic one because it was   and   old children. I was tired of doing Facebook posts with my personal comments about how angry I am and sending it into the void. I wanted to see if I could offer anything as a writer. Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence? I was not raised in a gun house. My dad owned a gun because he was a   manager. I\u2019m pretty common sense on gun control: I believe that people have the right to own a personal handgun for safety if they feel the need to. I don\u2019t feel the need to. There\u2019s a good police force out there that will do it for me. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage?  We use a very theatrical conceit when the moment happens, it\u2019s an actual giant shattering of glass. I promised every person I interviewed that I would never try to make this a piece of sensationalism. I don\u2019t want to see that. We\u2019re dealing with children, and that\u2019s some touchy ground. That\u2019s not the story I\u2019m trying to tell. Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era?  I would never thank him for anything. But I\u2019ve got to thank him because the climate he\u2019s created in this country has made this piece relevant. I had students on opening weekend saying, \u201cIt made me realize that I want to become an activist. \u201d This    liberal heart was in heaven. What inspired your play? I knew that nothing legislative was going to happen after Sandy Hook it filled me with such boiling rage. I really just couldn\u2019t imagine how furious you would be if you lost a child like that. That was the seed. Also, I\u2019ve been   fascinated with the contradictions over what it means to operate a weapon, that in order to do it effectively you need to be calm, almost meditative. Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence? I\u2019ve shot a rifle  \u2014   a   rifle at Boy Scout camp. I have never encountered any gun violence personally in Chicago, where I live. But I have read articles about someone living in my neighborhood, driving a route that I drive all the time and seeing someone get shot in the head. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage?  I have yet to see realistic violence rendered onstage that didn\u2019t take me out of the experience: I\u2019m so aware that what I\u2019m watching is not real. We do ourselves a disservice when we try to make theater a literal space. It\u2019s always way more effective to enlist an audience\u2019s imagination. When you see weapons onstage, your eyes just go to them. It\u2019s troubling, but they\u2019re really fascinating, seductive, complex machines. If we put them onstage, you\u2019re just going to be waiting for that thing to discharge, waiting for that sound. Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era? I don\u2019t know if this is still true in the age of Trump, but I would say that   gun control was the issue about which I felt the greatest despair. These objects are so seductive it\u2019s almost impossible to control ourselves around them. Once you have access to this really powerful machine that gives you the illusion of power, it becomes really difficult to imagine yourself separated from it. You have to acknowledge that clearly there is some emotional connection going on, some deep fears and deep longings and deep love. What inspired your play? When Sandy Hook happened, my daughter had just turned 7. I think it woke me up. I grew up in a political family and my dad was very, very wrapped up in politics, but I had never taken on anything on my own. The only way I know how to write is the smallest, most microcosmic way. I had attempted to write something more overtly political, more of a polemic, and it didn\u2019t feel true to me. Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence? I grew up in Dallas. It wasn\u2019t odd to see gun racks in trucks. I shot rifles at summer camp just like everybody else did. Many of the families in the neighborhood I grew up in had guns. We didn\u2019t think, like, \u201cOh, there are weapons of murder in our homes. \u201d They were kind of casually for protection. When I was in college, my girlfriend and I were like, \u201cWell, what happens at a gun show?\u201d So we went to one. And it was kind of spectacular. First of all, there was a bar. And there were guns for ladies, which was the craziest thing to me  \u2014   little, pretty guns specifically for ladies. And the ladies were lined up. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage?  Violence is more about entertainment than it is about the reality of what happens to people. It\u2019s like sex onstage. It doesn\u2019t work. I studied with Romulus Linney at Columbia, and he was always like: \u201cDon\u2019t put a gun onstage. It\u2019s going to be horrible. \u201d Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era?  I think it has to do with personal culpability as a member of society. In light of the election, whatever one\u2019s political bent is, we have to take on social responsibility. I don\u2019t think we should carry the bag of guilt in the heaviest way, but we are culpable. You cannot live in a vacuum. So you have to examine what\u2019s important to you and what you can do about it.'"}, "time": 1742562015.3281083}
