She also stars as an unhappy Hollywood gallerist in Tom Ford\u2019s \u201cNocturnal Animals. \u201d Ms. Adams sat down with the Bagger for a brief chat on, of all days, Nov. 9. Ms. Adams steered clear of politics  \u2014   \u201cit\u2019s a time for reflection,\u201d is all she would say  \u2014   but confessed to having slept little the night before. She spoke about what she describes as \u201cthe blank nature of my face\u201d and the unexpected joy of not preparing to get naked onscreen in front of Mr. Ford. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. At the beginning of your career you were known for more joyful roles, but in these two movies, these are somber and even, in the case of \u201cNocturnal Animals,\u201d tortured women. Do you feel like there\u2019s a natural evolution to that? Definitely. It takes you to a more reflective place, as you get older. Before I was just sort of working to find a niche, and now it feels like I\u2019m taking roles with more intention. I feel more in control of my instrument, so I feel like, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do that, let\u2019s try different things. \u201d Let\u2019s take, and I say [here she made air quotes] risks, because at the end of the day I\u2019m only risking humiliation. I\u2019m not really risking my life or anything. Yet you\u2019re very vulnerable you can see it in your eyes. You\u2019re known for that, this sort of naked thing. The thing is, my eyes photograph on camera really big. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the color, the shape. The sort of blank nature of my face. I have one of those faces, without makeup, it\u2019s literally a gesso canvas. On my flight, the steward came up and said, \u201cI kept thinking I knew you from somewhere!\u201d He only recognized me after he heard my voice. That must be nice, being able to slip by unnoticed in everyday life. I love it, I get to be a mama. I get to navigate the world for the most part. You said you initially felt not  much of a connection with the role, until you had a conversation with Denis about what the core of the story was about. Can you talk about that? I think I was more concerned [with] how it would play in the final film. I knew that it was going to be   and that it was written as a very intimate portrayal of a mother telling a very complicated, scientific, nuanced story to her daughter, about the decisions she made. It just felt commercially risky. But Denis was onboard. And I could tell from the way he spoke that he had this emotional, he had an intellectualism. That\u2019s probably not the word. For someone who plays a linguist it takes me a long time to find the right word. Emotional intelligence? There it is. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. This is what today has done to me. [Denis] has an emotional intelligence that I trusted when I met him. He looks you in the eyes. I trust that.  \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d came after that and you wore these gorgeous   clothes. Were you able to eat at all? I did get to, which was nice, especially for the scenes when I was younger, because I wanted my face to look younger [by looking more rounded]. You know films shoot out of order. One night, they said, \u201cCan we shoot the shower and bathtub scene?\u201d And I was like, \u201cYou gotta give me time. I\u2019m still on solids!\u201d I say that as a joke. But it made me more    because I hadn\u2019t spent all this time thinking about what I needed to look like. You\u2019ve been nominated for Oscars five times  \u2014   is it stressful going through the whole process again and again? It\u2019s easy to get caught up, not in the nominations  \u2014   not in the   aspect of it, but just in everything that it becomes. The red carpets and the overimportance. It\u2019s easy for that to sort of take center stage in that moment, especially when you\u2019re a young woman. For me, it definitely at times is overwhelming, that whole process. But I\u2019m always grateful because the nomination for \u201cJunebug\u201d and campaigning launched what is my current career. So I can\u2019t   the process.'"}, "time": 1742563578.8938339}
