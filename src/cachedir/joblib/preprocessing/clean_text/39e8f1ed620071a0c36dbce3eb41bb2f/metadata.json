PMW translated the song\u2019s lyrics as follows: The Zionists coveted [our] homeland, Compounding damage and enmity, But the popular revolution awaits [them] The orchard called us to the struggle, We replaced bracelets with weapons, We attacked the despicable [Zionists] We do not want [internal] strife or disputes, While this invading enemy is on the battlefield, This is the day that jihad is needed, Pull the trigger. We shall redeem Jerusalem, Nablus and the country.
