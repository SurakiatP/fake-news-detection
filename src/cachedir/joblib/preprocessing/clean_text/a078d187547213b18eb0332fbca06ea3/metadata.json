[Conservatives worry that a tax credit included in the Ryan plan would cost too much and might create an expensive new entitlement program. Congressman Mark Walker ( ) chairman of the Republican Study Committee says, \u201cI want to make sure that we\u2019re not getting to a place where we\u2019re providing this   benefit that enables people. \u201d  House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows ( ) said refundable tax credits could be a \u201cnew entitlement program. \u201d He doubts that House leaders possess the votes necessary to pass refundable tax credits. Other conservatives object to taxing   health insurance plans. Rep. Pete Session ( ) chairman of the House Rules Committee, told reporters that this would amount to \u201ca Republican tax on Cadillac plans. \u201d Committees will meet in early March to draft Obamacare\u2019s repeal, although House Republicans remain disunified on the details. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) assured his fellow Republicans, arguing that a tax credit offers immediate help. Brady said, \u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\u2019s advanceable, so it\u2019s available today. \u201d Some    Republicans want to keep Obamacare\u2019s taxes to provide revenue for Obamacare\u2019s replacement. Brady, as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has significant power to draft Obamacare\u2019 replacement. He argued that Obamacare\u2019s taxes are bad for economic growth. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I don\u2019t want Americans to suffer under the Obamacare taxes. They\u2019re   they drive the prices of healthcare up I just think they\u2019re bad all around. \u201d Republicans continue to battle over Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.   states expanded Medicaid, and Congress continues to debate over how to scale back Medicaid expansion. The conservative House Freedom Caucus, along with Senator Rand Paul ( ) unveiled their Obamacare repeal bill that repeals Medicaid expansion entirely. The Ryan plan lowers the federal government\u2019s match rate for Medicaid spending back its traditional level. Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn ( ) told Breitbart News, \u201cThere is wide agreement amongst the governors, Republicans and Democrat alike, that they would like us to send Medicaid to the states. \u201d Blackburn believes that   Medicaid to the states will, \u201cget rid of some of the constraints from the federal government and offer a better product at a more affordable cost and help more people. \u201d Chairman Brady remarked that tax breaks in Obamacare\u2019s replacement would benefit all Americans, not just the few. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in raising taxes anywhere else, and so I think unlocking and redesigning the current tax break so not just a few Americans can use it, but all Americans can use it, I think that\u2019s where we ought to focus our thought, make sure we design it right and get it right. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628559.898866}
