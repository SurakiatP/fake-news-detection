The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN! \\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2016 \\nTrump made similar comments during the last presidential debate . \u201cThe element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.\u201d \\nUnfortunately for Trump, real military experts disagree. The next day, the New York Times reported that such warnings reduce civilian casualties and instill fear within the enemy, among other benefits. Then there was this quote: \u201c\u2018What this shows is Trump doesn\u2019t know a damn thing about military strategy,\u2019 said Jeff McCausland, a retired Army colonel and former dean at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa.\u201d \\nToday, Stephanopoulos asked Trump about his tweet and McCausland\u2019s comment. Trump doubled down . Oh, and check out how he first referred to General George Patton: \u201cThe Army War College \u2013 let me tell you, the element of surprise. I\u2019ve been hearing about Mosul now for three months, \u2018We\u2019re going to attack. We\u2019re going to attack.\u2019 Meaning Iraq\u2019s going to attack but with us, OK? We\u2019re going to attack. Why do they have to talk about it? Don\u2019t talk about it. Element of surprise. General George Patent [sic].\u201d \\nTrump subsequently correctly referred to Patton. But his later comments probably did nothing to reassure anyone about his suitability as commander in chief. Besides his desire to lecture McCausland, Trump brushed aside a challenge to his dire assessment of the Mosul operation. \\nWhen Stephanopoulos noted that Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said 35 ISIS leaders have been killed, Trump insisted : \u201cExcuse me: The resistance is much greater now because they knew about the attack. Why can\u2019t they win first and talk later? Why do they have to say, three months before the attack, we\u2019re going in?\u201d \\nOf course, Trump provided no evidence to support his argument that a surprise attack would have worked better. But why would he? In Trump\u2019s mind, he knows better than anyone about fighting ISIS, as he said last year that: \u201cI know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.\u201d \\nFortunately, it looks like most Americans don\u2019t believe him. \\nVideo via ABC News on YouTube .
