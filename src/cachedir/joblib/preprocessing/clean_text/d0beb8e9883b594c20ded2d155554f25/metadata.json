To its benefit, she said, the film \u201cdoesn\u2019t play like a retread or an ad for the next installment. \u201d That was the bull\u2019s eye for which Fox was aiming: Having been fed one superhero sequel after another  \u2014   Mr. Jackman has been playing Wolverine for 17 years  \u2014   audiences (in particular, a core fan base that has aged) are demanding that studios get more creative. Fox got the message last year, when its daring   \u201cDeadpool\u201d broke box office records and its rather rote \u201c : Apocalypse\u201d underperformed. Fox booked \u201cLogan\u201d into 4, 071 theaters, a large number for an   film. \u201cLogan,\u201d which cost roughly $100 million to make, not including marketing costs, collected an additional $152. 5 million overseas. For the weekend in North America, the horror movie \u201cGet Out\u201d (Universal) was second, collecting about $26. 1 million, for a   total of $76 million, according to comScore, which compiles   data. \u201cThe Shack\u201d (Lionsgate) starring Octavia Spencer as God and based on William P. Young\u2019s   novel of the same name, was third, arriving at about $16. 1 million in ticket sales, more than industry analysts had predicted before its release. \u201cThe Shack\u201d may have been dismissed by most critics, but viewers gave it an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, suggesting that it will ride    to solid ticket sales in the weeks to come. Lionsgate, which has been on a box office roll, spent a little over $20 million to make \u201cThe Shack,\u201d backing it with an aggressive   marketing campaign. Despite its   win at the Oscars, \u201cMoonlight\u201d (A24) only collected about $2. 5 million from more than 1, 500 theaters, its widest release yet, for a new total of $25. 4 million. On the plus side, A24 said that \u201cMoonlight\u201d was a top seller on    platforms. It was also released on DVD on Tuesday.'"}, "time": 1742563702.062447}
