But Samantha Bee is not waiting to see how this year\u2019s soiree unfolds or if those involved decide to hold it at all. Instead, Ms. Bee, host of the topical TBS comedy show \u201cFull Frontal With Samantha Bee,\u201d and her colleagues are planning a   that will take place in Washington on April 29, the same night as the Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner. This alternative gala, which is being called \u201cNot the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\u201d and was announced on Monday, will be at the Willard Hotel. Ms. Bee said that it was not an attempt to comment on or compete with that other,   banquet, but a night to include jokes about Mr. Trump that she and   comedians want to make. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to supersede it,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe just want to be there in case something happens  \u2014   or doesn\u2019t happen  \u2014   and ensure that we get to properly roast the president. \u201d Ms. Bee said that she and her \u201cFull Frontal\u201d producers got the idea for their event after Mr. Trump\u2019s election in November. \u201cWe were talking out loud about whether we thought the White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner would change during a Trump presidency, or if it would even exist,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then we thought, Why don\u2019t we just do one, just to do it in the way that we would want it done if we were hosting it?\u201d The \u201cNot the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\u201d will probably be shown on TBS in some form Ms. Bee said that those details were still being worked out, as was a lineup of talent. \u201cWe have binders full of people, but we don\u2019t have any specifics to offer yet,\u201d she said. Ms. Bee said that proceeds from her event would go to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The   dinner held by the Correspondents\u2019 Association, which advocates press accessibility at the White House and gives out journalism awards and scholarships, has come under scrutiny in recent years. Some news organizations and observers regard it as a   atmosphere for reporters to hobnob with the officials they are supposed to be covering objectively and adversarially. (The New York Times stopped sending journalists to the dinner in 2008.) The event has also been the scene of two notorious incidents. At the 2006 dinner, its featured performer, Stephen Colbert, delivered a scathing satirical takedown of President George W. Bush. Mr. Colbert\u2019s performance, in the guise of the arrogant   political commentator he played on Comedy Central, appeared to offend Mr. Bush and several of his aides, though it was widely celebrated by television and internet viewers. (The next year, the Correspondents\u2019 Association invited Rich Little.) In 2011, Mr. Trump, then a civilian and a guest at the dinner, sat   as he was mocked relentlessly by President Obama and Seth Meyers for having promoted the false theory that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Mr. Obama said of Mr. Trump at the time: \u201cNow he can get to focusing on the issues that matter. Like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened at Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?\u201d Mr. Trump lashed out the next morning, in an interview with The Times, saying Mr. Meyers had \u201cno talent\u201d and acknowledging his discomfort  \u2014   \u201cI am not looking to laugh along with my enemies\u201d  \u2014   while also speaking at length about possibly running for the presidency. Given the open hostility that Mr. Trump and his administration have displayed for the news media, some journalists have wondered if the Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner is a tradition worth preserving. Would Mr. Trump even attend this year, and what entertainer could make jokes about him without getting underneath his   thin skin? Comedians have only started figuring out how to riff on Mr. Trump as president, and there is a wide gulf between what Trump supporters and detractors think is funny about him. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association \u201clooks forward to hosting our annual dinner this year as we do every year to celebrate the First Amendment, reward some of the finest reporting of the past year and recognize promising young student journalists,\u201d its president, Jeff Mason, said in a statement. The association has not announced its entertainer for the April dinner, and Ms. Bee said she had no expectation of being asked. \u201cMy assumption is that that invitation is not coming,\u201d she said, \u201cand I don\u2019t blame them for that at all. \u201d Addressing the Correspondents\u2019 Association, she said: \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re thinking, but I really wish them well. I think that\u2019s going to be very challenging. Does 3 Doors Down do comedy? I don\u2019t know, maybe they do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628413.9997568}
