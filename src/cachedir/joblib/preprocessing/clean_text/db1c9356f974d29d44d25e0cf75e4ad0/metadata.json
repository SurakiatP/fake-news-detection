Gold had finished soaring about $64 when early returns indicated the possibility of an upset. So why was gold methodically disemboweled once Trump emerged as the official winner? \\nContrary to all the propaganda smoke being blown from the right and the left, Trump won because of economics. Going back to 1932, in any Presidential election year in which the growth in real disposable income was less than 3.1%, the incumbent party holding the White House lost the White House \u2013 in 2016 the official real disposable income growth has been 2.33%. Please re-read that fact and let it sink in. There\u2019s been six elections in which this occurred \u2013 this table was sourced from John Wiliams\u2019 Shadowstats.com: \\nIn other words, people vote with their wallets. The reason gold has been inexorably smashed in the paper markets \u2013 along with the Dow and S&P 500 manipulated higher \u2013 is nothing more than a form of propaganda in an attempt to make the public believe that a Trump presidency is a good thing \u2013 that Trump can save the economy from collapse. Jim Sinclair refers to this as \u201cMOPE:\u201d Management of Perception Economics. It\u2019s the Central Planners\u2019 signal that they still intend to continue stealing your wealth. They don\u2019t care who is sitting in the Oval Office. \\nThe takedown in gold included cooperation from India\u2019s Prime Minister \u2013 a western elitist lapdog \u2013 who \u201ccoincidentally\u201d removed large denomination currency bills from the banking system last week in an attempt to curtail the Indian public\u2019s current voracious appetite for physical gold. Removing this element from the global market last week enabled the Fed and bullion banks to bombard the Comex and LBMA with massive amounts of paper gold derivatives to push down the price of gold. \\nOf course, the shenanigans in the west have stimulated demand for gold even more in the Asian markets. Last night the market premium in Viet Nam soared to over $91. Premiums this high in Viet Nam have not been seen since at least 2011. On the Shanghai Gold Exchange the market premium soared to $12.47 above world gold \u2013 on Friday it was $8.20. It is rare when the premium gets this high on the SGE and signals very heavy demand. \\nIn today\u2019s episode of the Shadow of Truth, we put closure \u2013 at least for us \u2013 on last week\u2019s election and we explain why Trump has no intentions of \u201cdraining the Swamp\u201d and why the current take-down in the price of gold and silver is setting the market up for a much bigger move higher: Share this:'"}, "time": 1742564040.4429514}
