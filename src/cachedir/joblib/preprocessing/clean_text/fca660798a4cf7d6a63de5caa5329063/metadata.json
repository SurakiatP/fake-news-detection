College Republican representatives are claiming that the administration intimidated them, lied to them, and largely took the decision to cancel without them. [Speaking to Breitbart News, UC Davis College Republicans executive director, Andrew Mendoza stated that the campus group was \u201cabsolutely\u201d intimidated by campus faculty into cancelling the event. UC Davis administrators reportedly told the College Republicans that they would be \u201cpersonally liable for property damage and injury to people and even death. \u201d  \u201cThey basically took the decision without us and consequently forced us to take responsibility for it. \u201d said Andrew Mendoza speaking exclusively to Breitbart News, \u201cWe were heavily pressured by the university police to cancel the event, as we were told people\u2019s lives could be endangered if it went ahead. \u201d  All responsibility was placed on the young students, \u201cWe were told that if our insurance failed it would be on us. \u201d said Mendoza. Of course this is not legally accurate, colleges are required to keep speaker and students safe at their expense. The responsibility for the safety of students and MILO is on the college, not the event organisers.  UC Davis is still attempting to claim that there was never a risk of violence at the event and that protesters acted peacefully, despite video evidence that directly proves otherwise. \u201cThe police have been excellent, the students are being completely peaceful and respectful, and they are standing up for the rights of the community,\u201d said a UC Davis college counsellor as protesters outside reportedly smashed windows and threw barricades at police. \u201cUCD is denying that there were hammers there. \u201d said Kurtie Kellner, a communications director for the Davis College Republicans, \u201cWe were told by Milton Lang (Associate to the Vice Chancellor for Student Life, Campus Community and Retention Service) that there were in fact hammers at the event. \u201d  \u201cOur concern was about hammers and the protesters using them on the glass to get into building when the Chief of Police suggested that they had more concerning weapons. This was the safety concern that led to our cancellation of the event. If there hasn\u2019t been hammers, we wouldn\u2019t have feared for  \u2019s safety, and we wouldn\u2019t have felt pressured to cancel the event. \u201d  When asked for comment, UC Davis Associate Director Andy Fell said, \u201cTo reiterate the statement we issued last night, the DCR cancelled last night\u2019s event on the advice of UC Davis police and officials because it was no longer possible to continue the event safely. \u201d Watch MILO\u2019s full march through UC Davis to protest the cancellation of the event here.'"}, "time": 1742563377.929548}
