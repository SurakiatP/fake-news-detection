How in the world is it possible to simulatenously date 20 people remains a mystery that gives this whole story a bit of a fairy tale aura, but knowing that China suffers from a terrible male-to-female ratio let\u2019s assume that is somehow possible. \\nXiaoli, whose life remains veiled in secrecy, then sold all of the phones to a suspiciously particular place: mobile phone recycling site Hui Shou Bao, all for a total of 120,000 Chinese yuan, the equivalent of around $17,500. The woman then used the cash for a downpayment towards a countryhouse home.\\n\\n\\nXiaoli broke the news when she invited her co-workers for a house warming party. \u201cEveryone in the office is talking about this now. Who knows what her boyfriendsthink now this news has become public.\u201d\\n\\nFrom Qiaoba we also learn that Xiaoli \u201cis not from a wealthy family. Her mum is a housewife and her dad is a migrant worker, and she is the oldest daughter. Her parents are getting old and she might be under a lot pressure hoping to buy them a house\u2026 But it\u2019s still unbelievable that she could use this method!\u201d \\n\\nIt does indeed sound quite fantastical and made-up, and some have theorized that it\u2019s all just a theory to popularize the local Hui Shou Bao phone re-seller (the company has confirmed that it had indeed sold 20 iPhones from a single person recently).\\n\\nMeanwhile, the whole story quickly started becoming popular in China: a \u201920 mobiles for a house\u2019 hashtag went trending on local microblog Weibo and has been used more than 13 million times.\\n\\nReaction sway from admiration for Xiaoli\u2019s boyfriend-getting and management skills to sheer awe and condemnation of her actions. Whatever it is, Xiaoli \u2013 if she even exists \u2013 is now said to shy away from the public eye and to refuse interviews from media. That\u2019s actually not surprising\u2026 those 20 boyfriends surely would not be happy about her actions.\\n\\nPhone Arena \\nSOURCE '"}, "time": 1742561683.7293916}
