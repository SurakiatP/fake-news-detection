But it\u2019s still significant because the information made it to Fox News\u2019 Hannity Show . \\nHis name is Jeff Rovin . \\nAfter decades as one of Bill and Hillary Clintons\u2019 many retainers, Rovin is outing himself as the Clintons\u2019\u201c fixer \u201d\u2014 defined by Oxford Dictionaries as \u201c A person who makes arrangements for other people, especially of an illicit or devious kind. \u201d In Rovin\u2019s case, he claims to have been employed by the Clintons to suppress and remove from the media any scandalous news of their sexual affairs. Note: For a few of the Clintons\u2019 other retainers, see \u201c Hillary Clinton\u2019s medical handler, cleaner, & prompter were all at the last presidential debate \u201d. \\nRovin says he was paid $4,000 a month to keep the Clintons\u2019 open marriage and their respective adulteries from the news. In Hillary\u2019s case, she had \u201caffairs\u201d with Vincent Foster and with a female Hollywood honcho. Note: On July 20, 1993, Foster \u2014 who was Bill Clinton\u2019s deputy White House counsel at the time \u2014 was found dead on a park bench in D.C.\u2019s Ft. Marcy Park, supposedly from a self-inflicted gun shot. See \u201c FBI files linking Hillary Clinton to Vince Foster suicide vanished from National Archives \u201c. Note: According to the Clintons\u2019 former assassin Larry Nichols, when she was First Lady, Hillary regularly went to California on weekends to be with Hollywood producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and other women to \u201cworship\u201d Satan at \u201ca church\u201d. See \u201c Clinton friend and assassin Larry Nichols: Hillary is a satanist \u201d. Linda Bloodworth-Thomason , 69, is a television producer who, with her husband Harry Thomason, is best known for creating, writing, and producing the TV series, Designing Women . The couple are notable for their friendship with Bill and Hillary Clinton, which dates back to Bill\u2019s days as governor of Arkansas. The Thomasons created several short-subject political propaganda films for Bill, the most famous of which was The Man from Hope that introduced Bill at the 1992 Democratic Convention. The Thomasons did similar propaganda films for Hillary\u2019s run for the U.S. Senate and for other candidates, such as General Wesley Clark\u2019s presidential bid. Clark has endorsed Hillary for president. (See \u201c Obama-supporter Gen. Wesley Clarke: Disloyal Americans should be put in concentration camps \u201d) \\nHere\u2019s Rovin on Hannity , on Oct. 24, 2016: \\nThe National Enquirer first broke Jeff Rovin\u2019s story. Here\u2019s what Rovin told the Enquirer : \\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, I was working in Hollywood as a reporter for several national magazines and newspapers. Because of my good relationship with stars, publicists and the press I became \u201ca fixer\u201d: someone who helps stars keep embarrassing stories out of the press. I helped keep secrets safe for some of Hollywood\u2019s leading men. \\nIn 1991, my reputation was such that I was asked to work on behalf of a fast-rising figure on the national stage: Arkansas Gov. William Jefferson Clinton. I attended a meeting in Hollywood where I was told by an intermediary: \u201cThere will be a lot of stories coming out in the tabloid press. We want them buried.\u201d \\nI was informed that these stories would involve rumors of Bill Clinton\u2018s many sexual dalliances and an alleged ongoing affair of Hillary Clinton with a male member of her law firm, Vince Foster, as well as a female mover-and-shaker in Hollywood. \\nFor a retainer of $4,000 a month \u2014 paid by a third party, not the campaign \u2014 I was told to keep these stories hush-hush in one of two ways: by trading access to the Clintons for \u201cpositive\u201d interviews, or by paying the reporters. \\nThe payments were always cash, usually delivered in a movie theater or restaurant on Sunset Boulevard, and came in two denominations: $100 for a heads-up that a bad story was coming; or considerably more to kill the piece. \\nIt did not appear that the job would be terribly time-consuming: After all, Hillary reportedly had just one lover, and Bill\u2019s girlfriends were all in the past. \\nNot so. The sexual dalliances were ongoing \u2014 and so my communications with the West Wing, Air Force One and Camp David continued through 1998 \u2014 a stunning length of time when one considers that both the president and the first lady were supposed to be devoting their full energies to the business of the people of the United States! \\nThe gravest example of a Clintonian lack of judgment occurred in March 1994. Presidential brother Roger Clinton was marrying his eight-months-pregnant bride Molly. There was a bachelor party. Prostitutes were involved. Recordings were made. Recordings involving Bill Clinton. \\nArrangements for a meeting between Bill and a 26-year-old brunette were discussed when the president was to arrive in Dallas for the ceremony. \\nThe tape recording was offered, for sale, to The National Enquirer . Before the publication and its then-editor could publish a transcript, I swooped in and negotiated for the White House to give this paper exclusive access to the ceremony itself. Not even The Washington Post or The New York Times had that. The Enquirer was given leave to publish exclusive White House photographs. \\nAt the reception, while Bill Clinton sang with the piano player, Hillary was introduced to The Enquirer reporter. Her expression fierce, voice tight, she took and tightly held the reporter\u2019s hand and demanded, \u201cAre we done now?\u201d The reporter replied, \u201cMadam First Lady, with this incident, yes.\u201d \\nOf course, we were not done. This was one of many in an endless string of sexual stories arising from what effectively was the Clintons\u2019 open, polyamorous marriage. \\nI have kept these secrets for a quarter-century because Bill Clinton had become an elder statesman with heart trouble and Hillary Clinton seemed to be focused, at last, on the business of doing her job \u2014 for better or for worse. \\nI am coming forward now because of the endless attention the alleged indiscretions of Donald Trump have received. Nothing I have heard comes close to the sexual and moral corruption of the Clintons \u2014 many of which have yet to be revealed. \\nPredictably, the liberal media is focusing on one man\u2019s alleged misdeeds and ignoring another\u2019s proven sins. \\nI mention some of these here and now because we have only two serious candidates for the presidency. In the few weeks remaining until the election, we should not be weighing whose corruption is worse (the Clintons win by a landslide, if all were to be told), but who has the best ideas and leadership skills to become president of the United States.
