Although employing illegal immigrants is against the law, the bishop said that his campaign was about giving people \u201cin a hopeless situation\u201d the chance at a livelihood. J\u00f8rgensen, who is also a   agitator for gay rights, said he has already received \u201cseveral positive responses\u201d from people who would like to help. \u201cI am quite optimistic that we can achieve something among church organizations and with church connections,\u201d he said. J\u00f8rgensen was inspired by learning that an evangelical church in Stavanger, Norway, had employed an Eritrean woman named Tita who had been living in the country illegally for 8 years, a move he called \u201cbrave\u201d and \u201cimportant. \u201d The bishop has reportedly requested a meeting with Immigration Minister Sylvi Listhaug (FRP) who has called the    bishop\u2019s proposal \u201cirresponsible. \u201d \u201cWhat he is in fact doing is creating false hopes for people who have to return to their homeland,\u201d she said. \u201cIndividuals who have received a final rejection of their asylum application are obliged to return home. \u201d For his part, J\u00f8rgensen posted on Facebook that what the Minister calls illegal is really just \u201c . \u201d \u201cSylvi Listhaug calls us irresponsible,\u201d the bishop responded in a recent   \u201cbecause we encourage people to do something illegal. But Listhaug doesn\u2019t know what degrading and dehumanizing experiences many \u2018undocumented\u2019 have had over the years. \u201d According to current legislation, employers who hire illegal foreign workers are subject to fines or imprisonment. Christian Wedler, a local leader for the Progress Party (FRP) in Stavanger, said that he understands the desire to help people who find themselves in a difficult situation, yet people must also consider \u201cwhat is right for the country and the big picture. \u201d \u201cIf an asylum application has no consequences, then the system will collapse altogether and we are going to experience arrangements that ensure that the whole asylum system is in jeopardy,\u201d he said.
