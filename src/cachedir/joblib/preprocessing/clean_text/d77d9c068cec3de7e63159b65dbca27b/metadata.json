Rule No. 4: Take responsibility when you mess up, and you will be rewarded. \u201cI make mistakes everyone does,\u201d Mr. Spicer, now the White House press secretary, told his audience. \u201cHow you handle those mistakes is what makes the difference in life. \u201d This week, Mr. Spicer is trying to take his own advice. One day after he delivered a stunner of a gaffe from the White House lectern  \u2014   favorably comparing Hitler to President Bashar   of Syria, then clumsily referring to Nazi death camps as \u201cHolocaust centers\u201d  \u2014   Mr. Spicer gave an abject apology on Wednesday, saying, \u201cIt really is painful to myself to know that I did something like that. \u201d \u201cI made a mistake there\u2019s no other way to say it,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, his face taut, during a scheduled interview in Washington. \u201cI got into a topic that I shouldn\u2019t have, and I screwed up. \u201d Facing a national outcry that included calls for his resignation, Mr. Spicer offered no excuses, describing his remarks as \u201cinexcusable and reprehensible\u201d and acknowledging that the timing  \u2014   during Passover and the Christian Holy Week  \u2014   \u201ccompounds that kind of mistake. \u201d \u201cOn both a personal and professional level, yesterday was not a very good day in my history,\u201d he told the MSNBC anchor Greta Van Susteren. His appearance, at a forum sponsored by the Newseum, was broadcast live by CNN and MSNBC, just one sign of the intense interest in the press secretary\u2019s remarks. Mr. Spicer, whose tenure as President Trump\u2019s chief spokesman has made him a television sensation and   punch line, calls himself his own worst critic. And while he said \u201cit\u2019s an honor\u201d to serve as press secretary, he also marveled to Ms. Van Susteren about the level of scrutiny that the role entails. \u201cNo matter what you do, what you wear, it gets amplified to a degree that you couldn\u2019t imagine,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. (The fit of his suit and placement of his lapel pin are just two of the sartorial scandals he has faced so far.) When Ms. Van Susteren moved on to other topics, some of Mr. Spicer\u2019s usual feistiness resurfaced. He complained about the Washington news media\u2019s focus on palace intrigue over policy, and he repeated his laments about journalists\u2019 reliance on anonymous sources. Responding to reporting based on unidentified sources, he said, was like \u201cshooting at a ghost. \u201d Ms. Van Susteren responded by pointing out that the president often made assertions without providing evidence or the source of his information. Mr. Spicer also criticized the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, which the Trump administration is boycotting this year. \u201cI don\u2019t think that just sitting there and watching a bunch of celebrities walk by is somehow an indication of how much you care about or respect the press or the First Amendment,\u201d he said. But asked by Ms. Van Susteren if he enjoyed his job, Mr. Spicer responded, \u201cI love it. \u201d \u201cI truly do believe it\u2019s an honor to have this job,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is a privilege. And if you don\u2019t believe it, then you shouldn\u2019t be here. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563280.1333675}
