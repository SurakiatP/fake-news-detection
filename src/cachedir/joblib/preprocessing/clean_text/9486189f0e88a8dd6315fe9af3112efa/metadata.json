Occasionally, one  \u2014   Boy or Big Boy, say, or Snow White  \u2014   struck a pose, tipping its beak up to emit a banshee shriek. \u201cThey\u2019re just a bunch of drama queens, honey,\u201d said Pat Cleveland, as she sat in the backyard of her house in a rural part of New Jersey, sipping on a   juice drink the color and texture of algae. Drama queens, as it happens, is a topic on which Ms. Cleveland has some stories to tell. This she does in \u201cWalking with the Muses,\u201d a picaresque new memoir about a tall, skinny   girl (\u201cnot black enough to be black or white enough to be white\u201d) hailing from a section of East Harlem that she terms the Golden Edge. In her 1950s childhood, Ms. Cleveland writes, that neighborhood was still representative of a now largely bygone city, a place where \u201cthe Jews, the blacks, the Irish and the Puerto Ricans all had a corner of their own. \u201d Ms. Cleveland took her leave from childhood\u2019s haunts fairly early and through the kind of cinematic turn of fate that seems to have characterized much of her life. A Vogue editor discovered the     on a subway platform, chased her down and set her on the road to becoming a fashion model. \u201cModel\u201d is probably too limited a job description for a woman who, through a singular combination of moxie,   beauty and preternatural energy, spent the next five decades romping across continents and stamping her imprint on an industry that, if it didn\u2019t always know what to do with her, inevitably succumbed to her goofball appeal. \u201cPat was a muse for Halston, Stephen Burrows, Giorgio Sant\u2019Angelo and Antonio Lopez,\u201d Diane von Furstenberg, the designer and chairwoman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, wrote in a recent email from Tokyo, where she had paused briefly on her way to Bhutan. \u201cShe was, and is still, magical. \u201d Whether on catwalks in New York or the various European capitals of fashion, Ms. Cleveland made for an unconventional model, one not classically beautiful and yet \u201ca more gorgeous version of Josephine Baker,\u201d as Ms. von Furstenberg said. Dancing, twirling, strutting on a runway and \u201cmoving like no one else,\u201d as the designer added, Ms. Cleveland had an effect on the catwalk best captured by another top model of the era, Janice Dickinson: \u201cWhen she moved, she painted the air around her with the clothes. \u201d To comprehend what Ms. Cleveland is to the recent history of fashion, it probably helps to consider what fashion is not anymore: an insular and largely tribal business dominated by cliques and elites. Compelling to a largely cult fan base, fashion in Ms. Cleveland\u2019s 1970s prime was anything but the corporate juggernaut and global entertainment spectacle it has since become. American fashion, in particular, during the era when Ms. Cleveland first appeared, was also more porous and racially diverse than it would be in the subsequent decades. Success in the business was measured in those days not by social media metrics but by an ability to bewitch the cognoscenti, to make yours a name they whispered about. And seemingly Ms. Cleveland has been an object of fascination for those around her almost from the time she was born 65 years ago to a white Swedish saxophonist and an   artist from the South. Soon after, Ms. Cleveland\u2019s father, Johnny Johnston, returned to Sweden, leaving her mother, Lady Bird Cleveland, to raise her   young daughter alone. \u201cIf you\u2019re a single black woman and have a Swedish lover, life is never going to be easy, and Lady Bird didn\u2019t have the opportunities in life,\u201d Ms. Cleveland said. \u201cBut her lesson to me was always, whatever your circumstances are, it\u2019s up to you to create your own world. \u201d She was sitting at a picnic table in the mild spring sunshine. Behind her was a clutch of the tame peacocks that had strayed from a nearby farm and into the yard of her modest   house one day and somehow remained. Set amid a row of   plots carved from rich local farmland, the house was Lady Bird\u2019s until her death last year from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. More than a decade ago, Ms. Cleveland and her husband, the photographer Paul Van Ravenstein, returned to the United States from the Italian mountain village where they\u2019d been living, to care for the ailing woman. \u201cI tell my kids I expect them to do the same for me,\u201d Ms. Cleveland said of her son, Noel Van Ravenstein, a sometime model and yoga teacher, and her daughter, Anna Cleveland, who herself has cut a considerable swath through the modeling business in recent years. Throughout the house hang scores of the prolific Lady Bird Cleveland\u2019s paintings and drawings images of black historical figures crowd the walls there, stand five deep in a storeroom and are even taped inside kitchen cabinet doors. A parallel domestic presence is that of Gurumayi Chidvilasananda, the Hindu spiritual leader who counts Ms. Cleveland among her devotees. Dressed in a     and snug plum jeans, Ms. Cleveland looked surprisingly fresh that day, particularly given that she\u2019d driven home from Manhattan at 6 in the morning, after a marathon   photography session with Anna Cleveland for a catalog. The prosaic suburban setting seemed a far cry from her glamorous work life and from the   haunts Ms. Cleveland depicts in her book. It was not easy to square the serene figure at the picnic table with the goofball na\u00eff who over the years found herself on   jaunts through the Serengeti with tempestuous models and photographer divas who spent a thousand nights clubbing in New York or Paris fueled by lavish quantities of Champagne and other stimulants who embarked on nearly that many libidinal adventures along the way. \u201cI practically killed myself at the Tenth Floor,\u201d she remarked offhandedly, referring to a   1970s gay dance club made famous in Andrew Holleran\u2019s novel \u201cDancer from the Dance. \u201d \u201cI was wearing platform shoes and went up on a ladder and started laughing and dancing because we all had poppers and I almost fell off. \u201d \u201cWalking with the Muses,\u201d a densely peopled and illustrated volume, is studded with the boldface names of Ms. Cleveland\u2019s acquaintance (\u201cDiane Vreeland was a freak and she liked the freaks,\u201d she remarks) and amorous partners  \u2014   Mick Jagger, Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty make appearances  \u2014   but also with cultivated figures from her mother\u2019s Harlem Renaissance coterie. It was Carl Van Vechten who snapped some of Ms. Cleveland\u2019s earliest photos. What\u2019s notable about Ms. Cleveland\u2019s story is its grounding in an untutored wisdom, her own canny powers of observation and a willingness to write with candor about professional challenges that, as often as not, were rooted in race. When she first appeared on the scene, according to Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, a contributing editor of Vogue, Ms. Cleveland was a type of model people hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cA skinny girl from Harlem with no boobs and a frizz of hair,\u201d is how she describes herself. At the height of her powers, that same skinny girl from Harlem was transformed into a star on the evening of Nov. 28, 1973, when she  \u2014   one of 30 black models chosen to participate in a benefit runway show held at the Palace of Versailles outside Paris  \u2014   took to the stage in front of 800 guests, many of them prominent or titled, and, spinning and twirling, left little doubt in the minds of observers that the immediate future of fashion belonged not to the Old World but to the New. \u201cPat was never a parody of the   model,\u201d Mr. Talley said. \u201cThe way she walked, her sense of theatricality wasn\u2019t something she acquired. Whether she was being zany, goofy Pat or ethereal, ephemeral,        Pat, what she did was natural to her. It came from within. \u201d So, too, Ms. Cleveland said, does the memoir, which she composed in multiple drafts across a dozen years, employing notes made so long ago that most were written on a typewriter. \u201cI wrote this book myself, honey,\u201d said Ms. Cleveland, as she glided indoors and into a sunlit studio where stacks of early drafts lay piled alongside snapshots of a   girl in pigtails and scores of magazine tear sheets showing a glamorized Ms. Cleveland as captured by nearly every    fashion photographer of any note: Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Bruce Weber and Steven Meisel. Ms. Cleveland doesn\u2019t shrink from facing down in her book an industry not always welcoming of black beauty, then or now. \u201cIn the beginning, people said, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t use her, you shouldn\u2019t use her,\u2019\u201d the designer Stephen Burrows explained recently by telephone. \u201cBut her personality was so electrifying and inspirational, you could imagine anything you designed on her, like a sketch come to life. \u201d It is dismal to note that, as Ms. Cleveland said, the racial discrimination she experienced at the start of her long career persists. \u201cIt\u2019s still out there, my darling,\u201d said the model, who decades ago fled New York for Paris, where she vowed to remain until a black woman appeared on the cover of Vogue. (Beverly Johnson earned the distinction in August 1974.) It was early on during her sojourn in Paris that Ms. Cleveland fell in with the   fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez, and through him that she met the model Donna Jordan, the designer Karl Lagerfeld and many others from among an impossibly glamorous faction the writer Alicia Drake characterized as the Icarus Generation in her 2006 book, \u201cThe Beautiful Fall: Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris. \u201d Most favored of the perches for that group were the banquettes of the Caf\u00e9 de Flore on the Boulevard  . There, as Ms. Drake wrote, \u201cdesigners, models and muses all came,\u201d seeking notice, arrayed on one side of the room a cluster of beautiful and seductive Yves Saint Laurent loyalists  \u2014   people like Loulou de la Falaise and Betty Catroux  \u2014   and opposite them, half hidden behind potted palms, \u201ca dazzling throng of Americans\u201d from the camp of Mr. Lagerfeld. \u201cWe were just like two little girls from Little Rock,\u201d Ms. Cleveland says of herself and Ms. Jordan, a reference to the beautiful provincials in \u201cGentleman Prefer Blondes. \u201d \u201cWe were comrades and we were going to get that Vogue cover!\u201d she adds. Failing that, they would win the embrace of designers like Valentino and Oscar de la Renta and Thierry Mugler and Ms. von Furstenberg, and of Mr. Burrows and Kenzo and Yves Saint Laurent. So besotted was Halston with how Ms. Cleveland looked and moved in his clothes that he drew her into his inner circle, anointing her a \u201cHalstonette. \u201d It is a challenge to conjure, in an age of anonymously interchangeable and often robotic creatures, her effect on those lucky enough to have observed her working her ephemeral magic on a runway. For those who did, she remains unforgettable. \u201cI still have a visceral, electric memory of her,\u201d said Michael Gross, the author of \u201cModel: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women\u201d and \u201cFocus: The Secret, Sexy, Sometimes Sordid World of Fashion Photographers,\u201d which will be published on July 5. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just dancing, it wasn\u2019t leaping, it certainly wasn\u2019t mere walking,\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cShe was the living embodiment of not just the clothes, but the joie de vivre, the energy and enthusiasm, everything that was great about that particular moment in fashion and the joy of being alive. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628525.085225}
