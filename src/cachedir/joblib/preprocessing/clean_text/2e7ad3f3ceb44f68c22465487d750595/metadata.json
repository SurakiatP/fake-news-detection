Hairdresser Helen Archer was accused of abetting the gentrification of her community when she tried to protest plans to turn a derelict pub into boutique flats for awful people. Archer, of Hackney Citizens Against Gentrification, said: \u201cApparently, residents\u2019 associations are very trendy these days, and using direct action to confront property developers might lead to us being mistaken for a collective of Japanese fashion photographers. \u201cLeafleting nearby streets is gentrification, writing to the council is definitely gentrification, and starting a blog about the destruction of local history is exactly the sort of thing a tosser in a corduroy waistcoat would do.\u201d Professor Henry Brubaker, of the Institute of Studies, said: \u201cOnce the gentrification of a deprived area has begun, everything that happens there is evidence of its transformation into a pretentious haven for entitled bastards. \u201cThe pop-up cycle boutiques and organic juice salons are coming. They will come if you accept gentrification. They will come if you fight gentrification. Nothing can stop them. \u201cTalking about gentrification is also gentrification, and so is reading about it, so this one\u2019s on you too.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742561818.0393739}
