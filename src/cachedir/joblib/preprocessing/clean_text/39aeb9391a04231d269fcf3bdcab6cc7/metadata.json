As you can see in the graphic below, 2015 sales surged 12% over a previous record year to reach almost 1/4 million units. \\nThere are many factors driving this growth, which you can read about here; but one point worth noting is that the two leading countries are the US and China, with China leading the way. \\nThe nature of robotics is also changing, as new developments in artificial intelligence are giving robots an increasing range of potential uses. One key area, of course, is security. Robot security guards have already begun appearing at prisons , care facilities , and schools, in various locations around the world. \\nOne U.S. robot company, Gamma 2 Robotics, has designed several models for mass production. Their latest \u2013 RAMSEE \u2013 can be seen in the video below. A true mass roll-out of this fully autonomous security guard could significantly impact the 1.5 million humans that are currently employed in some form of security patrol. \\nRAMSEE advertises the following capabilities: Is a physical presence that autonomously patrols without supervision Provides real-time data: intruders, motion, heat, fire, smoke, gases & more Is a human-machine interface that creates a powerful force multiplier \\nSignificantly, Gamma 2 Robotics has partnered with Hexagon Safety & Infrastructure: \u201cthe global leader in public safety and security solutions.\u201d \\nHowever, RAMSEE is missing one thing: weapons. For that, we have to travel to China, where they seem to have embraced police robots full throttle. \\nIn late 2015, I covered an announcement from China\u2019s Xinhua news agency where they announced the development and deployment of 3 weaponized \u201canti-terrorism\u201d robots that would be far more active than a mere patrol: \\n\u201cThe toy-sized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield,\u201d said the report, following their unveiling at the 2015 World Robot Conference in Beijing. \\nThe first model is known as a \u201creconnaissance\u201d robot, which scouts for poisonous gases, dangerous chemicals and explosives before transmitting its findings back to base.If this initial investigation detects a simple bomb is the source of danger, the second robot model \u2013 a small explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) machine \u2013 would be sent in to diffuse it. \\nBut with other, more complicated threats, an attacker robot would start its mission, armed with \u201cminor-caliber weapons, recoilless rifles and grenade launchers\u201d. \\n\u201cWith a sighting telescope, a trigger and a safe installed, the attacker can hit its target from a long distance,\u201d Xinhua said. \\nThe local police force in Beijing was reported to be among the buyers for the three robots , which are priced at 1.5 million yuan (\u00a3156,000) for the set by manufacturers HIT Robot Group, who are based in the northern city of Harbin. \\n\u201cApart from anti-terror operations, they can also be applied in fire fighting, public security, forestry and agriculture,\u201d the company\u2019s sales manager Chen Deqiang said, according to Xinhua. \\nIf we have learned anything about anti-terrorism efforts, authorities consider front-line deployment to be areas of public travel. We were given the TSA based on such notions, and have since witnessed its intrusive role in airports, and soon-to-be at other public transportation if authorities have their way. \\nChina has gone to the next level with a robot TSA of sorts called AnBot that is equipped with what is essentially a taser-like device that is being fittingly compared to a cattle-prod. \\nImage Credit \\nIt was first introduced at a tech show earlier in the year, and was speculated to have been designed for protest suppression. For now, its first job is to patrol China\u2019s Shenzhen airport. \\nMost alarming, however, is that it is tied to one of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet. \\nThe back end of this \u201cintelligent security robot\u201d is l inked to China\u2019s Tianhe-2 supercomputer , where it has access to cloud services . AnBot conducts patrols, recognizes threats and has multiple cameras that use facial recognition. \\nThese cloud services give the robots petascale processing power , well beyond onboard processing capabilities in the robot. The supercomputer connection is there \u201cto enhance the intelligent learning capabilities and human-machine interface of these devices,\u201d said the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review, in a report released Tuesday that examines China\u2019s autonomous systems development efforts . [emphasis added] \\n( Source ) \\nThis link to \u201ccloud services\u201d is a new trend in robot artificial intelligence that also has been referred to as the Wikipedia for Robots \u2013 essentially an Internet Cloud Brain. Through robot-to-robot information sharing they can speed up their learning process \u2026 autonomously. Examples have included robots that can learn to cook, and robots that can learn the tasks involved in care-giving. However, when applied to policing, things become much more ethically troubling. \\nPeople were outraged in the U.S., for example, when a robot in Dallas was used to deliver a pound of C-4 explosive to a U.S. citizen whom the police deemed a sufficient threat worthy of immediate execution. At least, in that case, a human made the decision. But it is being viewed as a tip-toe along the path to the widespread use of \u201ckiller robots\u201d much as we have seen with the use of drones. Discussion was once limited to overseas \u2013 egregious enough \u2013 but there has been a growing voice of those who are urging weaponized domestic police drones. \\nAs John Vibes wrote , it might be inevitable: \\nThe Taser corporation is planning on building a drone that is equipped with a stun gun, according to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal. \\nNot only will the drones be equipped with tasers, but there is also talk of them being autonomous, meaning that an actual human won\u2019t necessarily be needed to fly the drone. \\nThis is actually already being done in India , the first country to have approved the use of drones attached with \u201cnon-lethal\u201d weapons. And, just this week, British tabloid, The Sun , had a feature entitled \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is preparing an army of robots and drones to take on its enemies, Deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin admits.\u201d Given the available facts, this title no longer seems so deliberately sensational. \\nClearly we are entering a potentially dangerous convergence of expanding robotic artificial intelligence along with the political will to continue allowing robots more and more autonomy as they carry out the traditional duties of the military and police. Some experts argue that the precision of robotics will curb many of the abuses we have seen from our military and police. But is that the trend we are actually seeing? Or will automated systems of violent control inevitably lead to even greater industrial-level suppression and killing? \\nNicholas West writes for ActivistPost.com .
