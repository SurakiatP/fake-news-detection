(AP Photo/The Oklahoman, Matt Strasen, File)\\nUnderscoring once again the dangers of America\u2019s unreliable fossil fuel infrastructure, a significant U.S. oil pipeline has been shut down after a leak was reported Monday morning.\\nEnterprise Products Partners said Monday it had shut its Seaway Crude Pipeline, a 400,000-barrel per day conduit that transports crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to Gulf coast refineries. The leak occurred Sunday night in an industrial area of Cushing. The company did not provide an estimate of the volume spilled, but said there was no danger to the public.\\n\u201cSeaway personnel continue to make progress in cleaning up the spill, substantially all of which has been contained in a retention pond at Enbridge\u2019s facility,\u201d the company said in a news release (pdf), explaining that the pipeline is a \u201c50/50 joint venture\u201d between Enterprise and Enbridge Inc. \u201cVacuum trucks are being used to recover the crude oil and return it to storage tanks on-site.\u201d\\n\u201cThe impacted segment of the legacy pipeline has a capacity of 50,000 barrels,\u201d the release added, \u201chowever the actual amount of crude oil released will be significantly less and won\u2019t be determined until recovery efforts are complete.\u201d\\nThe incident comes after another pipeline rupture in Pennsylvania early on Friday, where 55,000 gallons of gasoline poured into the Susquehanna River, and about one month after a major gasoline pipeline run by Colonial Pipeline Co. had to halt pumping for a couple of weeks due to a spill in Alabama .\\nMeanwhile, UPI reports that \u201c[t]he release from the Seaway pipeline is the second associated with the Cushing storage hub in less than a month. Plains All American Pipeline reported problems with infrastructure from Colorado City [Texas] to Cushing earlier this month.\u201d\\nEnvironmentalists, Indigenous people, and energy companies are in the midst of a heated debate over pipeline safety . Water protectors and their allies along the proposed route of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) have been saying for months that the project threatens their right to safe drinking water.\\n\u201cOil pipelines break, spill, and leak\u2014it\u2019s not a question of if, it\u2019s a question of where and when,\u201d 13-year-old Anna Lee Rain YellowHammer, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, wrote in a recent appeal.\\n\u201cWith such a high chance that this pipeline will leak,\u201d she wrote of the Enbridge-backed DAPL , \u201cI can only guess that the oil industry keeps pushing for it because it doesn\u2019t care about our health and safety. The industry seems to think our lives are more expendable than others\u2019.\u201d\\nIndeed, referring to the Cushing leak, one observer tweeted on Monday: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re screaming #NoDAPL ! They always break!\u201d\\nSeaway Crude pipeline system shut after Cushing, OK spill. That's why we're screaming #NoDAPL ! They always break! https://t.co/oXiLXcBRly\\n\u2014 Deanna Rilling (@DeannaRilling) October 24, 2016\""}, "time": 1742562996.9954965}
