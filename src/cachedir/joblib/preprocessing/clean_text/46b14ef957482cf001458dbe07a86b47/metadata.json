Online they encountered the   recruiters of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, who said their first loyalty should be not to their nation but to Islam. Then they plotted sensational violence. In the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey and stabbings at a mall in Minnesota, the suspected perpetrators fit the same rough pattern as in previous attacks at the Boston Marathon in 2013 in San Bernardino, Calif. in 2015 and in Orlando, Fla. in June, as well as in the terrorist assaults in Paris and Brussels. A rich recruiting pool for Al Qaeda and the Islamic State includes what psychologists call \u201c\u201d young adults whose identities have not yet solidified. Their uncertainty makes them vulnerable, said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist and clinical professor at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIt allows the individual to attach his identity to something that is larger and inflates his sense of himself,\u201d he said. The uncomfortable   status can be especially acute for those with recent immigrant roots. Living in two cultures at once is very enriching for most people but very unsettling for others, said Lorenzo Vidino, the director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. For some Muslim immigrants, he said, \u201cYou have a message at home that\u2019s very conservative, and a completely different message from the society around you when you\u2019re growing up. \u201d The full history of Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, the naturalized American of Afghan birth who is accused of planting bombs in Manhattan and New Jersey, is not yet known. But his 2014 arrest in an alleged stabbing in a family dispute suggests a young man adrift his scribbling in a notebook the names of Osama bin Laden, Abu Muhammad    \u2014   an Islamic State leader  \u2014   and Anwar   the   Qaeda recruiter, appeared to reflect a   embrace of jihadism. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a Chechen immigrant and the older of the two Boston Marathon bombers, turned to Islamist extremism when his hopes for a boxing career dimmed. He was 26 at the time of the attack. Omar Mateen, the son of an Afghan immigrant with outspoken political views, was 29 when he opened fire at an Orlando nightclub, killing 49 people. He had been dismissed from training as a prison guard after making disturbing remarks about weapons, and ended up as a private security guard. Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, the   son of immigrants from Pakistan, found work as a health inspector but had spent years searching for dates and a mate before meeting Tashfeen Malik online and marrying her in Saudi Arabia. Together, the couple attacked a luncheon attended by Mr. Farook\u2019s colleagues last December, killing 14 people. \u201cWhen you dig into these cases, you find the \u2018why\u2019 is a very complex question,\u201d said Peter Bergen, the director of the security program at New America, a research group, and author of \u201cUnited States of Jihad. \u201d Personal disappointment, perceptions of discrimination, anger about American foreign policy and the desire \u201cto become a hero in one\u2019s own story\u201d are all at play in addition to jihadist ideology, he said. \u201cMany of them just take their grievances and dress them up in the garb of Islam,\u201d Mr. Bergen said. That has become easy in the age of the internet. The attackers in San Bernardino, Orlando and New York all had expressed support for the Islamic State, and they and the Boston bombers were devotees of the voluminous online work of Mr. Awlaki, who was killed in an American drone strike in 2011. His arguments remain highly popular on the web, where he urged Western Muslims to reject even the friendliest   neighbors, whom he called \u201cSally Soccer Mom and Joe  . \u201d Mr. Rahami wrote in his journal that \u201cSheikh Anwar,\u201d as well as Mr. Adnani of the Islamic State, had \u201csaid it clearly\u201d: \u201cAttack the kuffar,\u201d or   \u201cin their backyard. \u201d Farhad Khosrokhavar, a sociologist at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris and the author of \u201cRadicalization,\u201d said Muslims in Europe more often than those in America felt \u201cfrontally rejected\u201d by the larger society. He said he had often seen in his research individuals who felt neither French nor Arab. \u201cIn France, they are blamed for not being French enough, and when they go to their parents\u2019 country of origin, they are blamed for not being Arab enough,\u201d Mr. Khosrokhavar said. \u201cThat double denial can push them to adhere to a radical version of Islam, as a kind of lifeline: Since I am neither French nor Arab, neither American nor Afghan, I am Muslim and to hell with you all,\u201d he added. These roots of radicalization do not make immigrants in general a danger. In the United States, immigrants have a lower rate of crime and violence than other Americans. Converts to Islam are disproportionately represented among Americans and Europeans drawn to extremism, and other ideologies also motivate mass violence  \u2014   as in the case of Dylann Roof, who was 21 when he fatally shot nine black people last year at a church in Charleston, S. C. in the name of white supremacy. \u201cThe actual content of the ideology is secondary,\u201d said Mr. Meloy, the psychologist. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is the identification and fixation. \u201d But the Islamist terrorist groups target the particular anxieties of Western Muslims from immigrant backgrounds, posing recruitment as a religious loyalty test. They call on supporters to reject the nations where they live and embrace instead a devotion to the ummah, the global community of Muslims. The West is at war with Islam, they say, and you must strike out to defend your fellow Muslims. That message has been delivered with particular power by Mr. Awlaki, often reinforcing the newer propaganda efforts of the Islamic State. As an imam who counseled immigrants at three American mosques, and as a   who had lived in both countries and in Britain, Mr. Awlaki understood the worries of Muslims in the West. When he joined Al Qaeda, he did his best to open a gulf between them and their   neighbors. \u201cThe important lesson to learn here is: Never, ever trust a kuffar,\u201d Mr. Awlaki said in a 2003 lecture in London that was captured on video and remains a YouTube favorite. \u201cNow, you might argue and say: \u2018But my neighbor is such a nice person. My classmates are very nice. My    \u2014   they\u2019re just fabulous people, they\u2019re so decent and honest. \u2019\u201d Yet these   can never be relied upon, he said. Later, after moving to Yemen, he spoke not only of shunning   but also of attacking them. In a 2010 video, he tried to shame his listeners into choosing his brand of religion over their country. \u201cTo the Muslims in America I have this to say: How can your conscience allow you to live in peaceful coexistence with a nation that is responsible for the tyranny and crimes committed against your own brothers and sisters?\u201d he said. \u201cHow can you have your loyalty to a government that is leading the war against Islam and Muslims?\u201d He has led many people down the jihadist path, and not just in   countries. The Counter Extremism Project, an advocacy group based in Washington, said Wednesday that it had counted 88 \u201cextremists\u201d who had been influenced by Mr. Awlaki: 54 in the United States and 34 in Europe. Most such jihadist recruits are the children of immigrants, said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, and the author of \u201cGlobalized Islam. \u201d His research shows that 65 percent of Muslim extremists in France and Belgium are from this second generation. \u201cThese young people have broken away from their parents, who they blame for many things  \u2014   for practicing the wrong Islam, for having brought them to the West, for having failed in life,\u201d Mr. Roy said, noting that Mr. Rahami reportedly had clashed with his father. But such conflicts pass. Few jihadists are from the third generation, the grandchildren of immigrants, he said.'"}, "time": 1742563702.5666516}
