The dissemination and proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d for the purpose of \u201cthought control\u201d is a form a fascism that is seeded in the Totalitarian creep that is engulfing the U.S. political system. \\nThe commentary published by John Whitehead of the The Rutherford Institute is a must-read in order to put the \u201cfake news\u201d problem into its proper context. \\n[T]the \u201cnews\u201d we receive is routinely manufactured, manipulated and made-to-order by government agents. Not when six corporations control 90% of the media in America. And not when, as Davies laments, \u201cnews organizations which might otherwise have exposed the truth were themselves part of the abuse, and so they kept silent, indulging in a comic parody of misreporting, hiding the emerging scandal from their readers like a Victorian nanny covering the children\u2019s eyes from an accident in the street.\u201d The Pentagon has now designated \u201cinformation operations\u201d as its fifth \u201ccore competency\u201d alongside land, sea, air and special forces. Since October 2006, every brigade, division and corps in the US military has had its own \u201cpsyop\u201d element producing output for local media. This military activity is linked to the State Department\u2019s campaign of \u201cpublic diplomacy\u201d which includes funding radio stations and news websites. \\nYou can read the rest of this here: When It Comes To Fake News, The Government Is The Biggest Culprit \\nThe manipulation of economic data and the markets is yet another insidious form of propaganda and implementation of political/economic control. I\u2019ve detailed ad nauseum evidence of the fraudulent economic data across a wide range of Government reports \u2013 employment, GDP, housing, inflation, etc. \\nThis is going to get worse regardless of who or which party occupies the White House. It\u2019s about control and power. Ultimately the Government has no control over the laws of economics. When the majority of the population feels the pain of economic distress in spite of the misleadingly optimistic economic reports, the Government has no choice but to implement control policies in order to maintain its power. \\nThere is nothing we can do about this but you can prepare accordingly if you at least recognize the truth. If you want to see who this plays out, I would suggest re-reading \u201c1984\u201d and \u201cAtlas Shrugged.\u201d Share this:'"}, "time": 1742628441.874831}
