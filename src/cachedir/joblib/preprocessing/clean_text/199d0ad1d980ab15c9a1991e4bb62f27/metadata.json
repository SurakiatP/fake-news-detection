Tom Cotton ( ) took to the Senate floor on Thursday ahead of the vote on the spending bill to fund the federal government through September, citing as the main reason he voted against it the flood of unskilled workers that could be admitted to the United States under the legislation. [\u201cI want to hone in on one particular provision that shows just how bad this process is,\u201d Cotton said, noting the bill is almost 1, 700 pages in length.  \u201cThey don\u2019t hide the good things in the bill, they only hide the bad things,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cSo look to page 735, section   you will find an increase in   visas of almost 79, 000. \u201cA 120 percent increase over the normal annual cap of a   seasonal visa program for temporary workers that can take up to nine or ten months,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary. It has nothing to do with funding the government, nothing. \u201d Cotton criticized the process and noted it is unclear how the visa section got into a spending bill. \u201cBut this is what it does: it takes jobs away from American workers and abuses the immigrants that come into this country,\u201d Cotton said, noting that according to the Department of Labor thousands of guest workers have been abused by American employers, including sexual abuse. \u201cIt is a   form of indentured servitude,\u201d Cotton said. Breitbart News reported ahead of the spending bill vote that the it allows the Department of Homeland Security to import at least 20, 000 extra foreign   workers for seasonal jobs in the United States, instead of requiring companies to recruit, train, and pay marginalized Americans. The   program currently allows companies that do seasonal work to import up to 66, 000 foreign workers each year instead of recruiting and hiring Americans. The program is supported by Democrats and Republicans eager to aid local business groups, which are competing against each other for American workers, and which face competition from the companies that employ roughly eight million illegal immigrants. The program means companies don\u2019t have to pay a premium to hire Americans for seasonal overtime work that leaves them unemployed in winter, and it also reduces pressure on the companies to recruit and train youths and marginalized Americans, including millions of Americans who have fallen out of the workforce. The imported workers are also paid at rates that are lower than needed to attract Americans to those jobs  \u2014   which also means that the companies can pay lower wages to their   American workers. Cotton said the spending bill reinforces the false narrative about American workers and what jobs they are willing to take. \u201cA lot of the arguments for this kind of program boil down to this: No American worker will do that job,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cThat is a lie. It is a lie. \u201d \u201cThere is no job that Americans will not do,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cThere is no industry in America where a majority of workers are not   American citizens or   lawful immigrants  \u2014   not landscapers, not construction workers, not ski instructors, not lifeguards, not resort workers, not crab men, not a single one. \u201d \u201cIf the wage is decent and the employer obeys the law, Americans will do the job,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not, they should pay higher wages. To say anything else is an insult to the work ethic of the American people who make this country run. \u201d '"}, "time": 1742562320.3285213}
