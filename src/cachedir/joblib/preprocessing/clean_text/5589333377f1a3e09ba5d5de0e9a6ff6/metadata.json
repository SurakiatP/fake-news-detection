They shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody\u2019s name. \u201d  Trump reacted to some of the applause during his speech by saying, that the \u201cdishonest media\u201d would say he didn\u2019t get a standing ovation because \u201ceverybody stood and nobody sat. So, they will say, \u2018He never got a standing ovation.\u2019 They are the worst. \u201d He later added, \u201cI want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It\u2019s fake, phony, fake. A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are. They are the enemy of the people, because they have no sources. They just make them up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed, there are no nine people, I don\u2019t believe there was one or two people, nine people.   \u2026     They make up sources. They\u2019re very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people, the fake news. They dropped off the word \u2018fake,\u2019 and all of a sudden, the story became the media is the enemy. \u201d Trump further stated that he wasn\u2019t against the media and didn\u2019t mind negative stories if he \u201cdeserved\u201d them. He added, \u201cI\u2019m against the people that make up stories, and make up sources. They shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody\u2019s name. \u201d After saying that there were good reporters out there, Trump concluded by referencing the \u201cClinton News Network\u201d and saying, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their false stories, they say that we can\u2019t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment.   \u2026     I love the First Amendment, nobody know  \u2014   loves it better than me, nobody. I mean, who uses it more than I do? But the First Amendment gives all of us, it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely. It gives you the right, and me the right to criticize fake news, and criticize it strongly. And many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda, and it\u2019s not your agenda, and it\u2019s not the country\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s their own agenda. they have a professional obligation, as members of the press, to report honestly, but, as you saw, throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn\u2019t tell the truth. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564165.2033231}
