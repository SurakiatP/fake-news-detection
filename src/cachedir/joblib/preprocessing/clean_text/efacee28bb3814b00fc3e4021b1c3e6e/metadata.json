So when Trump says the thing\u2019s rigged, I\u2019m not sure exactly what he means and I\u2019m not sure I always agree with him. But I do think that when we say over and over someone can\u2019t win, that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout.\u201d \\nHe added, \u201cThe polls are put out, you know to make it either look closer than it is or to make it look like Democrats have a better chance. And I think it\u2019s done by design to try to dampen turnout.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561701.504256}
