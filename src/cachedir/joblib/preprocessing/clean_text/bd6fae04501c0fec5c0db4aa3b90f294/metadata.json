Not enough patience. Instead, Ms. Singh can be found on the wrong side of the curb as she makes her way from Pennsylvania Station to her job on Third Avenue near 40th Street, and then back again. She prefers dodging yellow cabs and bicyclists to navigating sidewalks teeming with commuters, tourists and   vendors, all jostling for elbow room. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the walk, it\u2019s just the people,\u201d Ms. Singh, an account coordinator for the Univision television network, said. \u201cSometimes, they\u2019re rude. They\u2019re on top of you, no personal space. They\u2019re smoking. It\u2019s tough. \u201d Ms. Singh is just one among many pedestrians experiencing a growing phenomenon in New York City: sidewalk gridlock. While crowding is hardly a new problem in the city, the sidewalks that cemented New York\u2019s reputation as a   walking city have become obstacle courses as more people than ever live and work in the city and tourism surges. The problem is particularly acute in Manhattan. Around Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, two of the city\u2019s main transit hubs, commuters clutching coffee cups and briefcases squeeze by one another during the morning and evening rushes. Throngs of shoppers and visitors sometimes bring swaths of Lower Manhattan to a standstill, prompting some local residents to cite clogged sidewalks as their biggest problem in a recent community survey. Foot traffic has slowed to a shuffle along some of the city\u2019s most famous corridors. On Fifth Avenue, between 54th and 55th Streets, 26, 831 pedestrians  \u2014   enough to fill Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall combined  \u2014   passed through in three hours on a weekday in May 2015, up from 20, 639 the year before, according to city data. Transportation officials are taking measures to alleviate the congestion. To help accommodate foot traffic, they are adding more pedestrian plazas across the city, expanding the presence of a streetscape feature first embraced by the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. One is scheduled to open soon on 33rd Street near Penn Station. There are also plans to widen a   sidewalks in Flushing, Queens, in the next year (the city\u2019s sidewalks vary in width, but must be at least five feet wide). While a crowded sidewalk is simply a symptom of a crowded city, it resonates deeply because it affects almost everyone. Unlike overstuffed subways or tourist attractions like, say, Times Square, there is no going around the sidewalks. They are to New York what freeways are to Los Angeles: an essential part of the infrastructure. Sidewalks not only get people from Point A to Point B, but also serve as a shared public space for rich and poor, native and tourist alike. \u201cSidewalks are the unifying glue of the city,\u201d said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University. \u201cIt\u2019s the one part of the city that everyone has to use. You cannot avoid sidewalks. \u201d Crowded sidewalks are not just a New York problem. They have created bottlenecks and logistical hurdles and have raised safety concerns in cities across the country. Since 2013, public works officials in San Francisco have widened two sidewalks in Fisherman\u2019s Wharf and the Castro, popular tourist areas with a lot of foot traffic. A third sidewalk project is planned for Second Street, one of the main routes to ATT Park, the baseball stadium where the Giants play. In Seattle, a busy stretch of East Pike Street in the Capitol Hill neighborhood that is lined with restaurants, bars and clubs was closed to cars on three Saturday nights last summer to make room for pedestrians overflowing from the sidewalks. \u201cIt just feels so jammed with humanity it becomes a rough situation,\u201d said Joel Sisolak, sustainability and planning director for Capitol Hill Housing, a community development corporation that has worked with city officials to address the issue of crowded sidewalks. Space on New York\u2019s sidewalks is at a premium at a time when the city\u2019s population of 8. 5 million is higher than ever. Add in the record 59. 7 million visitors who are expected to descend on the city this year, up from 48. 8 million in 2010, and it is a recipe for thoroughfares packed like sardine cans. Chris Heywood, a spokesman for NYC  Company, which oversees the city\u2019s tourism efforts, said his group was increasingly highlighting attractions outside Manhattan in hopes of dispersing visitors. Scott Gastel, a spokesman for the city\u2019s Transportation Department, said it had conducted research into pedestrian behavior at crosswalks and had monitored pedestrian volumes at 100 street locations to track   trends in neighborhood commercial corridors. Along bustling 34th Street, the city has added about 20, 000 square feet of pedestrian space in recent years, including   bus bulbs that extend the sidewalk pavement to give bus riders more room to wait. In Lower Manhattan, overcrowded sidewalks topped the list of residents\u2019 concerns in a survey conducted last year for the local community board. The problem was aggravated in some areas by sidewalk clutter such as construction scaffolding, large garbage bags, vendors and fixtures like lights, signs, newsstands, benches, planters and recycling bins. \u201cYou add all that up, and it\u2019s difficult to walk on the narrow sidewalk,\u201d said Catherine McVay Hughes, the community board\u2019s chairwoman, whose term ended on Thursday. If there is an epicenter of crowded sidewalks in New York, it is near Penn Station, where pedestrians, food carts and newsstands all vie for space. Only London and Tokyo have sidewalks as congested, said Daniel A. Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership, which oversees the business district in the area. As many as 14, 000 pedestrians an hour walk in front of the Modell\u2019s Sporting Goods store on Seventh Avenue near West 34th Street, according to 2015 data collected by the partnership. The commuter crowd is also growing. An average of 92, 314 riders boarded New Jersey Transit trains at Penn Station each weekday in fiscal year 2015, up from 79, 891 riders in fiscal year 2010. In the same period, average weekday boardings on New Jersey Transit buses at the Port Authority terminal also increased, to 78, 006 riders from 72, 506. Veteran pedestrians have tried to adapt. They shoulder their way into bike lanes or walk purposefully on the street alongside cars  \u2014   eyes ahead, earphones in  \u2014   forming a de facto express lane. They move en masse along Seventh and Eighth Avenues like a storm system on a weather map, heading north in the mornings and south in the evenings. \u201cYou know how the system works,\u201d said Roque Santos, 48, a stagehand who commutes daily from Jersey City. \u201cI cross the street even before the light changes to beat the crowd. \u201d Peter Raskin, a sports marketing executive, has made walking in the street part of his daily routine. He zipped north on Seventh Avenue the other morning, even when there was room on the sidewalk. \u201cI\u2019m used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI stay in the street with my head down. \u201d In 2016, there had been 55 pedestrian fatalities as of Sunday, an improvement from the 79 fatalities for the same period in 2013. Michael D\u2019Angelo, an accountant who works in Midtown, said that in the past year he had seen a   pedestrians walking in the street struck by cyclists. Still, Mr. D\u2019Angelo said he often had no choice but to step off the curb because he could not get by all the people along Eighth Avenue. His bus home to Pennsylvania leaves Port Authority at 5:55 p. m. with or without him. \u201cEverybody is trying to beat everybody,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause everybody has someplace to go. \u201d Then there are the inattentive walkers, those who text on their phones or read newspapers while moving, and the meandering tourists who seem oblivious to the ways of the street. They stop midstride, step on someone\u2019s heel or cut off people without warning. The result? Sidewalk rage. \u201cWhen you get    and New Yorkers, it\u2019s like mixing Clorox with ammonia, it doesn\u2019t work  \u2014   there\u2019s a chemical reaction,\u201d said Jato Jenkins, a street worker, as he swept a stretch of Seventh Avenue. \u201cThe New Yorkers walk their normal route, and the    are going the opposite direction, like salmon going upstream. \u201d Mr. Jenkins said everyone was miserable and on edge, especially in the sweltering summer months, so that even the slightest bump could set off tempers. He said he had seen women cursing at each other and men pushing each other and grabbing each other\u2019s shirts. Virginia Garcia said she had been on the receiving end of such outbursts. \u201cPeople are running around like crazy, and they don\u2019t stop,\u201d said Ms. Garcia, who stands at the intersection of Seventh Avenue and West 36th Street with a sign advertising a local pub. \u201cThey push you, they hit you and they don\u2019t care. \u201d David Wentz, a mail carrier who pushes a   cart around the garment district, said he tried to arrange his day around the busiest times for foot traffic. \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Disney World down here. \u201d But for Mr. Moss, of the Rudin Center at N. Y. U. crowded sidewalks show how far the city has come. During the 1970s, he pointed out, people used to avoid the sidewalks in the East Village and other neighborhoods for a different reason: They feared criminals and felt safer walking out in the open, down the middle of a street. Today, \u201cpeople want to be in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cA crowded sidewalk is a sign of vitality. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561933.714589}
