Primaries in six states played out even as the presidential nominations seemed to be set. Hillary Clinton had already hit the delegate threshold to secure the Democratic nomination, but cemented her standing with a wins in New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. Bernie Sanders vowed to fight on, hoping a win in California might prompt superdelegates to defect to him. ______ 2. Donald Trump  said his comments about a Hispanic judge  \u2014   suggesting he would not be able to handle a case against the   Trump University fairly because of his heritage  \u2014   had been misconstrued. Mr. Trump spoke after Speaker Paul Ryan, above, called Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism \u201cthe textbook definition of a racist comment\u201d and \u201cabsolutely unacceptable. \u201d ______ 3. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, goaded by concern over a possible Trump presidency, showcased an unusually cooperative approach on his second visit to the White House in two years. He took crucial steps toward ratifying the Paris climate accord and finishing the purchase of nuclear reactors, with a military deal to come. \u201cModi wants to get as much as he can out of Obama\u2019s last months in office,\u201d an analyst said. ______ 4. More than 350, 000 people have signed a petition for the recall of a California judge who sentenced this Stanford University student, Brock Turner, to only six months in jail after he was convicted of sexual assault. The victim\u2019s   cry for justice, published after the sentencing, has been viewed more than 8. 5 million times. ______ 5. Muhammad Ali died just as a foundation devoted to the photographer Gordon Parks was preparing to exhibit some of his images of the boxer. The new show features previously unseen photos of Ali taken on assignment for Life magazine between 1966 and 1970. Above, Ali praying before a bout in London. ______ 6. J. K. Rowling pleaded with fans to keep the plot twists in \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d secret. The play, which begins at the point where her   series ends, opened in previews in London. No spoilers here: \u201cRon still provides comic relief,\u201d our reporter says, \u201cHermione remains cerebral and slightly bossy and Harry tries as hard as he can but doesn\u2019t quite live up to his own expectations. \u201d ______ 7. In a rare victory against prison abuses, five New York City correction officers were convicted of all charges in the beating of a Rikers Island inmate in 2012. The inmate testified that he was punched, kicked and stomped, and spat up blood for months. Several more accused officers are to hear their verdict on Friday. \u201cRegrettably, some people think of prisoners as less than human,\u201d said a lawyer. ______ 8. The Syrian president, Bashar   swore to retake \u201cevery inch\u201d of territory lost in six years of civil war. His defiant address offered no hope that he would back a revival of talks to find a political solution. Meanwhile, U. N. officials said the Syrian authorities had delayed approval for desperately needed food aid for civilians trapped in a   area near the capital. ______ 9. Finally, the cosmologist Stephen Hawking, who suffers from a form of Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, made a significant addition to his groundbreaking work on black holes. Working with two colleagues, he found that the essential properties of whatever falls into these cosmic pits may, after all, survive. Or, as he put it recently, black holes \u201care not the eternal prisons they were once thought. \u201d ______ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
