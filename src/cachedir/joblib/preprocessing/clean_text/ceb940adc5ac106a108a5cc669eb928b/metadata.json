Its roots are complex, and lie with philosophic currents emerging out of Germany during WWII that somehow fused with American Trotskyist intellectual thinking (which then migrated to the Right). But, in gist, this current of political thought borrowed from the emerging discipline of psychology the concept of clearing the human mind \u2013 shocking it, or forcing it into becoming the \u201cclean slate\u201d on which a new mental program could be written by the psychiatric (or political) therapist respectively. \\nThe political aim here was to eliminate totalitarian thinking, and fascist mental \u201cprogramming,\u201d and to replace it with a liberal-democracy circuit board. \\nIndeed, the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was promoted by this intellectual group precisely in furtherance of the notion that concepts such as \u201cnational culture\u201d would become meaningless as a result of immigrant cultural dilution. By the 1970s and 1980s , the objective had evolved to implant the idea that there was really no politics to modernity (Fukuyama\u2019s End of History ) since all governance somehow had boiled down to technocracy: ensuring effective liberal market functioning \u2014 a matter best left to experts. \\nIn political terms, the \u201cclearing\u201d of the mind\u2019s inherited cultural clutter was to be achieved by cultural wars of political correctness. The class war had become discredited, but there were other \u201cvictims\u201d on whose behalf war could be waged: the war on gender discrimination, on racism, on denial of gay rights and sexual orientation stereotyping, on verbal micro-aggressions, on sexist language, or any ideas or language which disturbed the individual\u2019s sense of \u201csafe space\u201d were used as tools to clear away old cultural \u201cbrush\u201d of inherited national culture, and open the way for an American-led, globalized world. \\nThe ostensible factor linking all these notions of victim \u201cwars\u201d was that their antonym amounted either to fascism or authoritarianism. The problem with this has been that any white American blue-collar worker who attended church, who believed in family life, and was patriotic, became potentially a fascist, a racist, a sexist or a bigot. \\nMany ordinary Americans (and Europeans) disdain this \u201ccultural\u201d war which places him or her ( according to Hillary Clinton), in the \u201c\u2018basket of deplorables\u2019 Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, you name it,\u201d and who looked upon his or her community as representing nothing more than a \u201cfly-over\u201d state in the view of the U.S. coastal \u00e9lites. \\nThe deplorables have now risen up. Donald Trump\u2019s salty language was no liability \u2013 it was an electoral asset by thumbing his nose at this correctness, and at so-called \u201dsnowflake\u201d sensibilities . Trump\u2019s \u2018incorrectness\u2019 touched on a deep vein of resentment within American traditional society. \\nNot only does \u201cflyover America\u201d resent being termed \u201cdeplorables,\u201d they feel too clearly the disdain in which the American and European elites hold them \u2013 and dislike their arrogance in suggesting that there is only one rational, sensible way of doing things, and that they \u2013 the elites, being the experts and a part of the Davos set \u2013 should tell the rest of us what it is: (despite their decades of failures). \\nHigh Emotions \\nEmotions are high on both sides. To gain a sense of how bitterly the cultural war will be fought, listen to this from the partly-Soros-funded populist mobilization movement Azaaz (linked to America\u2019s Move On organization): \u201cDear Mr. Trump: This is not what greatness looks like. The world rejects your fear, hate-mongering, and bigotry. We reject your support for torture, your calls for murdering civilians, and your general encouragement of violence. We reject your denigration of women, Muslims, Mexicans, and millions of others who don\u2019t look like you, talk like you, or pray to the same god as you. Facing your fear we choose compassion. Hearing your despair we choose hope. Seeing your ignorance we choose understanding. As citizens of the world, we stand united against your brand of division.\u201d Billionaire currency speculator George Soros. (Photo credit: georgesoros.com) \\nIn short, with Brexit and the Trump victory, we are witnessing an historic point of inflexion. As I noted in mid-October (quoting British political philosopher John Gray): \u201cIf the tension between [the globalization project on one hand] and the [sovereign] nation state, [on the other] was one of the contradictions of Thatcherism \u2026 From Bill Clinton and Tony Blair onwards, the center-left embraced the project of a global free market with an enthusiasm as ardent as any on the right. If globalization was at odds with social cohesion, society had to be re-engineered to become an adjunct of the market. The result was that large sections of the population were left to moulder in stagnation or poverty, some without any prospect of finding a productive place in society.\u201d \\n\u201cIf Gray is correct that when globalized economics strikes trouble, people will demand that the state must pay attention to their own parochial, national economic situation (and not to the utopian concerns of the centralizing elite), it suggests that just as globalization is over \u2013 so too is centralization (in all its many manifestations).\u201d \\nWell, the global trend does not seem to be going in the Avaaz direction. It seems rather to be heading toward prioritizing the recovery of the state, of state sovereignty, and of state engagement in the pursuit of economic policies appropriate to the particular circumstances of the state, and in the state\u2019s ultimate responsibility for the welfare of the community as a whole. \\nThe question is what does this mean geo-strategically? And, secondly, can and will, Trump be able to deliver the new era? The short answer is that this new era seems to presage a period of political volatility, financial volatility and in Europe and the Middle East, the prospect of continued political \u201cshock.\u201d \\nIt is clear that Mr. Trump is not a globalist. It is also clear that he is aware of some of the dangers of the present global monetarist policy. He has spoken of the U.S. Federal Reserve creating \u201cbig ugly bubbles\u201d and that the next economic and financial crisis has been \u201ckicked down the road\u201d by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen \u2013 and clearly awaits whomsoever becomes U.S. President on Jan. 20, 2017. \\nPainted into a Corner \\nBut three decades of debt-led, financialized \u201cgrowth policies\u201d leave the President-elect effectively painted into a corner: global debt has spiraled; the bubbles are there still (kept afloat by Central Bank coordinated intervention), and bubbles are infamously difficult to deflate gently; zero or negative interest rates are undermining many a business model, but cannot easily be foregone, without crashing the bond market; and QE (printing money) is systematically eating away at consumer purchasing power through the dilution of its newly created purchasing power, and the latter\u2019s re-direction from \u201cmain street\u201d into the financial sector \u2013 lifting nominal asset values \u2013 but creating no tangible wealth. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping. \\nAmerica and Europe effectively are in debt-deflation. How then to grow incomes so that producers of goods and services can also afford then subsequently to purchase these goods and services? Trump\u2019s answer is to spend on domestic infrastructure projects. This may help a bit, but is unlikely \u2013 in itself \u2013 to lift and float the entire U.S. economy. \\nThe reality is that there is no obvious global engine of growth (now that China\u2019s \u201cindustrial revolution\u201d has stalled at best). Every nation now is in search of new engines of growth. And it is not easy to imagine that Europe or America will succeed in retrieving all those jobs lost through globalization. Indeed, the attempt so to do \u2013 in, and of itself \u2013 might just precipitate a further deceleration of world trade, and a consequent decline in output. \\nIn brief, the global economy may see a brief \u201choneymoon period\u201d thanks to a likely spurt of U.S. fiscal indulgence and a concomitant psychological lift, stemming from \u2013 at least \u2013 the U.S. construction sector enjoying something of a boom. But ultimately the very economic crisis which Mr. Trump anticipates may prove to be the only way to cut the Gordian knot in which three decades of unprecedented debt and money printing have fettered us. \\nAnd if he is to steer through the expected crisis, Mr. Trump will have to eschew the Siren voices of the present elites telling him \u201cTINA\u201d (there is no alternative, but to continue as before). \\nWhere Mr Trump might look for an early (and relatively easy) success however, may be in foreign policy. As \u201cNixon went to China,\u201d so Trump can go to Russia and China, and begin to treat them as normal nations with whom it is possible to find an intersection of interests (as well as areas of disagreement). \\nThis would be revolutionary. It could change the geo-strategical map. And as President Putin keeps repeating \u2026 the door is open (at least for now). Nothing is forever in politics. \\nAlastair Crooke is a former British diplomat who was a senior figure in British intelligence and in European Union diplomacy.
