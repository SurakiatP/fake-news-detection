Several complaints were lodged about the ad which producers say attempts to be all-inclusive with the people it features. \\nProduced by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), the ad titled \u201cYou Never Lamb Alone\u201d features a white TV presenter quickly being switched with a Bengali-Australian actor Arka Das who introduces a range of ethnicities and sexual orientations as he moves towards a barbeque cooking lamb - \u201cthe meat that doesn\u2019t discriminate\u201d. \\nhttp://giphy.com/gifs/bJJo3n1aUke1G \\nMost of the complaints to the Advertising Standards Board of Australia centered on the opening switch of white TV presenter Luke Jacobz to Das, after Jacobz utters the line \u201cI\u2019m here to address concerns that too many perky white males are contributing to the lack of diversity on our screens.\u201d \\nhttp://giphy.com/gifs/7nzEvHhZ1zI52 \\n\u201cThis advertisement clearly states \u2018too many WHITE people\u2019 in its commercial which is highly offensive,\u201d one complaint read, according to Bandt . \u201cPointing out someone\u2019s race and gender in an advertisement and then denigrating such race or gender is both racist and sexist,\u201d another read. To whoever wrote this lamb ad, thank you for all the tongue-in-cheek jokes about 'diversity' in Australia. https://t.co/E87jCXMFr3 \u2014 she stress@pax prep (@ChattyAnny) October 26, 2016 \\nMLA explained that the line was \u201csimply a nod to the common criticism that Australian television lacks diversity,\u201d with the ASB rejecting the complaints on similar grounds. Well done MEAT & LIVESTOCK AUSTRALIA for \u201cYou\u2019ll never lamb alone\u201d winning the Marketing Communications: B2C and B2B award. #AMI #AMIAwards \\n\u201cThe Board considered that the advertisement did not portray or depict material in a way which discriminates against or vilifies a person or section of the community on account of race or gender,\u201d they said. \\nCurrently the video has more thumbs down than thumbs up on YouTube, with comments now disabled.\""}, "time": 1742563357.2347436}
