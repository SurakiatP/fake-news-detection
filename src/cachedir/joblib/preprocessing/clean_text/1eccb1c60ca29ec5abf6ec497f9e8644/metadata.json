If you know anything at all about politics, you know people don\u2019t get promised a favor that big unless they\u2019ve given something equally massive in return. It would be hard to think of a political favor greater than being installed into one of the most esteemed positions in American government; it is the most significant thing that a presidential candidate can bestow upon someone from that position. \\nWe also know for a fact that Obama was already a \u201cfriend and political ally\u201d of Kaine back in 2011 according to this Washington Post article from that year, which was the year President Barack encouraged his friend Tim to step down from his position as DNC chair and make a run for retiring Democratic muppet Jim Webb\u2019s Senate seat. And according to this Politico article from the very same day, Obama then immediately installed former Clinton campaign co-chair and Hillary attack poodle Debbie Wasserman Schultz to the conveniently-vacated DNC chair, who then went on to orchestrate the rigging of the Democratic primaries for her girlfriend in violation of the Impartiality Clause of the DNC charter. \\nIn doing this, Obama was able to effectively hand-pick a successor to his throne who happens to be married to his Democratic presidential predecessor Bill Clinton. You\u2019re not supposed to be able to do that in a democracy. \\nWe\u2019ve talked about all that before. What I have personally failed to address adequately is the fact that Wasserman Schultz got away with it. She did every single thing she was placed in the DNC chair to do, she got caught, and then all she had to do was say \u201cOopsie! Looks like I\u2019ll have to resign now!\u201d and just stroll away, grinning like the cat that already ate the canary. Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742562929.340047}
