Just Gave The Best Assessment Of The 2016 Election Yet \u2013 And He\u2019s With Her (VIDEO)   \\nLouis C.K. just summed up the 2016 election in a few short minutes and he absolutely nailed it. And in case you were wondering, he is definitely with her. \\nThe Emmy award-winning actor sat down with Conan O\u2019Brien and explained that he isn\u2019t voting for Hillary Clinton because he thinks she is the lesser of two evils. He is voting for her because he thinks she is the best person for the job. \\nHe pointed out that Clinton won\u2019t just be the first woman to serve as president of the United States, she will be the first mother to hold the office. This he said, makes all the difference. Up until now, we have only had fathers in the White House. \\n\u201cA great father can give a kid 40 percent of his needs. Tops,\u201d C.K. said. On the other hand, he continued, \u201cany mother, just a shitty mother, a not even trying mother? 200 percent.\u201d \\nC.K. continued, pointing out that despite all the abuse she has taken over the years, she is still kicking a** and taking names. After giving what may be the best endorsement of Clinton that I have heard to date, he then broke the election down in terms that were crystal clear and added that \u201cif you\u2019re a liberal who\u2019s not gonna vote, you\u2019re a piece of shit.\u201d \\n\u201cIf you vote for Hillary you\u2019re a grownup; if you vote for Trump you\u2019re a sucker; if you don\u2019t vote for anyone, you\u2019re an asshole.\u201d \\nWatch Louis C.K. explain why we need \u201ca tough bitch mother\u201d sitting in the Oval Office, here. It\u2019s definitely one you don\u2019t want to miss: \\nFeatured image via video screen capture'"}, "time": 1742561806.8258743}
