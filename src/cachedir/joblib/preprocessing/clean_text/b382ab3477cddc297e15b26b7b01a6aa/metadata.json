Wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn\u2019t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. \u201cTrump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that\u2019s what I like,\u201d David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s not a saint, but look at his achievements. He\u2019s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he\u2019s not going to support the two-state solution,\u201d he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians.'"}, "time": 1742628496.4201772}
