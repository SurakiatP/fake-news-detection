On Sunday, demonstrators set up a new camp, called Winter Camp, in the pathway of pipeline construction, on what they consider unceded territory belonging to them under the 1851 Laramie Treaty. But Dakota Access LLC, the pipeline developer, said in a statement that they would be \u201cremoved from the land,\u201d which the company purchased from a local rancher last month. Police said on Wednesday that they are prepared to carry out that threat. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious we have the resources, we have the manpower, to go down there and end this,\u201d Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said in an interview. \\nAs the prospect of a raid on the Winter Camp looms, human-rights groups are increasingly concerned about law enforcement\u2019s use of force against peaceful pipeline protesters (who call themselves \u201cwater protectors\u201d), as well as journalists and legal observers. Demonstrators reported being pepper sprayed, beaten with batons, and strip searched in custody during the weekend\u2019s arrests. Journalists were also arrested, and had their equipment confiscated. \\nIn a Facebook post, Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier described Saturday\u2019s demonstration as a \u201criot,\u201d and wrote that the \u201csituation clearly illustrates what we have been saying for weeks, that this protest is not peaceful or lawful.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what he meant by a riot: The photo that accompanied the Facebook post showed protesters walking calmly through a field carrying banners and signs. Video footage showed people standing together, backing up as police approached. The only supposedly aggressive acts that the sheriff\u2019s department described in any specific form included that two arrows were shot towards law enforcement, one officer was spit on, and that a drone that protesters were using to monitor police activity \u201cattacked\u201d a helicopter. \\nOn Sunday, the Morton County Sheriff called for additional law-enforcement personnel from outside North Dakota. Officers from at least six other states\u2014Wisconsin, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming, Indiana, and Nebraska\u2014have arrived so far. In his call for more resources, the sheriff cited \u201cescalated unlawful tactics by individuals protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.\u201d State and local officials also requested, and received , temporary flight restrictions from the Federal Aviation Administration in a seven-mile radius around the protest camps, which may be an attempt to keep away news helicopters, as it was during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri. \\n\u201cWe have heard reports of escalation [from law enforcement], and we continue to be concerned with a number of issues,\u201d said Tarah Demant, the senior director of Amnesty International\u2019s Identity and Discrimination Unit. She cited the \u201csheer number\u201d of police that have been brought into the area; their use of military-style equipment including riot and camouflage gear, semi-automatic weapons, and armored vehicles; and the force that they\u2019re using to make arrests. \u201cIf police are making arrests\u2014for example, for trespassing\u2014they must be done in a way that upholds the rights of the people who are being arrested. And they need to be commensurate with the crime. The idea that police need to come out with pepper spray\u2026is worrisome,\u201d Demant said. \u201cIf there is a riot, then police or authorities have to provide evidence of that.\u201d \\nDemant is also concerned with rhetoric coming out of the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s office. The department has repeatedly emphasized that protesters are violent, though there is little evidence to back up its claim. In September, for instance, Kirchmeier spread a rumor that demonstrators were threatening to use pipe bombs against officers. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this in multiple places across the world, and in dictatorships. Declaring that something is a riot is a way to shut down protests,\u201d Demant said. \u201cIf there is a riot, then police or authorities have to provide evidence of that.\u201d She said the response from North Dakota officials fits a pattern of increasing militarization of law enforcement across the country, but that it also echoes a long history of official, state-sanctioned violence against indigenous people. \\nLaw enforcement officials have said that they are only responding to illegal activity on private property. \u201cWe\u2019re having our hand forced\u2026. we have to defend rule of law, and we have to make those arrests,\u201d Sheriff Laney said in the Wednesday interview. But Jennifer Cook, the policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota, said that, while trespassing is illegal, it\u2019s not a crime that warrants a militarized response. \u201cEven if [demonstrators] are on private land, and the private landowner requests that law enforcement eject them, it is in no way justified for law enforcement to come out and use excessive force against them,\u201d Cook said. She said that officials have been \u201cramping up\u201d the seriousness of the charges they\u2019re filing against protesters (and against journalists: Democracy Now! \u2019s Amy Goodman was arrested on a \u201criot\u201d charge). She sees that as an attempt to \u201cjustify the militarized response,\u201d rather than a reflection of demonstrators\u2019 actually acting aggressively themselves. \\nOn Saturday, Standing Rock Sioux chairman David Archambault II called on the Department of Justice to investigate the \u201cstrong-arm tactics, abuses and unlawful arrests by law enforcement\u201d in North Dakota. Though officials have consistently denied that they\u2019ve used excessive force, on Wednesday the Morton County sheriff\u2019s office did admit that the dog handlers whose animals attacked protesters in September \u201cwere not properly licensed to do security work in the state of North Dakota.\u201d It took nearly two months for them to reach that conclusion.'"}, "time": 1742563908.558764}
