The train slid past the mountains, bound for Kyoto, where the man, bearded,   was headed. The year was 1989. The train was a bullet train. The man on the train was in a quandary, and the man in the novel he was reading was in a quandary and as he read the novel, it emerged that his quandary and the one in the novel were essentially the same. The man in the novel was Sebastian Rodrigues, a Portuguese Jesuit priest sent to Japan in the 17th century. He was there to minister to Japanese Catholics suffering under a brutal regime and also to find out what had happened to his mentor, a priest rumored to have renounced the faith under torture. The man on the train was Martin Scorsese. He was in Japan to play the part of Vincent van Gogh in a movie by Akira Kurosawa, another master filmmaker. He was also there to move past a brutal battle in America\u2019s culture wars over a picture of his, \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ. \u201d The film had been pilloried by conservative Christians for a dream sequence in which Christ has sex with Mary Magdalene. In depicting Christ\u2019s life as a   struggle between his human and divine natures, Scorsese had intended to make a film that was at once an act of doubt and an act of faith. In the novel he was reading, the priest was shown profaning an image of Christ, and yet the act was an act of faith. The train slid past the mountains. Scorsese turned the pages. This novel spoke to him. All at once he saw it as a picture he would like to make. The novel was \u201cSilence,\u201d by Shusaku Endo, a Japanese convert steeped in European literature and the history of Catholicism in Japan. Published in Japan in 1966, \u201cSilence\u201d sold 800, 000 copies, a huge number in that country. Endo was called \u201cthe Japanese Graham Greene\u201d and was considered for the Nobel Prize. Greene referred to \u201cSilence\u201d as \u201cone of the finest novels of our time. \u201d The Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier brought Catholicism to Japan in 1549. In the next century, it was suppressed through the torture of missionaries and their followers, who were forced to apostatize by stepping on the fumie  \u2014   a piece of copper impressed with an image of Christ. In \u201cSilence,\u201d Endo took the missionaries\u2019 point of view, casting much of the novel in the form of letters by Rodrigues reporting back to his superior. He goes to Japan with another young priest, Francisco Garrpe, vowing to seek the truth about their mentor, Father Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Ferreira, but they are captured and shown the   reality of human suffering under torture. The shogunate invites the Japanese converts to avoid torture by stepping on the fumie. Many do some are tortured anyway. Rodrigues sees converts crucified, burned alive, drowned. A magistrate fluent in Christianity makes a grim proposal: Rodrigues can save the lives of the converts under torture if only he will step on the fumie and apostatize. When Scorsese returned from Japan, he procured the film rights to \u201cSilence. \u201d As the years passed, hardly a day went by without his mentioning the project to the people around him: actors, friends and even his old parish priest, Father Principe. As he made \u201cThe Aviator\u201d and \u201cThe Departed,\u201d \u201cShutter Island\u201d and \u201cHugo,\u201d he insisted that \u201cSilence\u201d was the picture he really wanted to make. A Jesuit was elected pope Islamic terrorists began targeting Christians in the Middle East. In 2014, with \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d a hit, Scorsese declared that \u201cSilence\u201d would be his next picture: He wouldn\u2019t commit to another until it was finished.   years in, filming began. What led this great American artist to make a story of missionaries in Japan his ultimate passion project? He is known for his gangster pictures he is a grandmaster of the profane. From the beginning, he has revealed himself to be an artist of intensely Catholic preoccupations, and the poisoned arrow of religious conflict runs straight through his career. \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d: a Vietnam vet as a spiritual avenger, bent on cleansing the city of filth through violence. \u201cCape Fear\u201d: a tattooed fundamentalist determined to exact God\u2019s justice. \u201cKundun\u201d: a young man raised to be a spiritual master, thrust up against   communism. Even \u201cLiving in the Material World,\u201d Scorsese\u2019s documentary about George Harrison, takes as its theme the conflict between flesh and spirit, between Beatle and seeker. \u201cSilence\u201d is a novel for our time: It locates, in the missionary past, so many of the religious matters that vex us in the postsecular present  \u2014   the claims to universal truths in diverse societies, the conflict between a profession of faith and the expression of it, and the seeming silence of God while believers are drawn into violence on his behalf. As material for Scorsese, then, \u201cSilence\u201d is apt, and yet Scorsese\u2019s commitment to it has been extraordinary, even by his exacting standards. To understand that commitment, I spoke with the filmmaker, with members of the cast and the production team and with others who know the novel well  \u2014   trying to grasp just what kind of an act of faith this film is. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s redemption, but there is such a thing as trying to get it right,\u201d Scorsese said to me, in the ungentrified New York voice familiar from the cameos in his movies. \u201cBut how do you do it? The right way to live has to do with selflessness. I believe that. But how does one act that out? I don\u2019t think you practice it consciously. It has to be something that develops in you  \u2014   maybe through a lot of mistakes. \u201d He had invited me to his East Side townhouse at 9 p. m. having spent a full day editing \u201cSilence\u201d in Midtown. The living room,     is decorated with a vintage movie camera,   posters for Jean Renoir\u2019s \u201cThe Grand Illusion\u201d and photographs of his wife and daughter. He is 74, compact and gray, with tremendous life in his eyes and a youthful ardor that seems to have its source in reverence for his elders  \u2014   like the Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda, who had signed a storyboard that Scorsese unhooked from the wall to show me. We took seats, and he began to talk. As the hours passed, the room, already dark, seemed to diminish around us, until it resembled a screening room, or a chapel, a place where questions of how to live are posed through stories and images. \u201cIt goes back to what Father Principe was telling me the last time I saw him, a couple of years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cFailing, doing something that is morally reprehensible, that is a great sin  \u2014   well, many people will never come back from that. But the Christian way would be to get up and try again. Maybe not consciously, but you get yourself into a situation where you can make another choice. And that\u2019s the situation Rodrigues is in\u201d  \u2014   he can choose to save the lives of others by renouncing his faith, the act he considers most reprehensible of all. \u201cSilence,\u201d no less than Scorsese\u2019s informal New York trilogy  \u2014   \u201cMean Streets,\u201d \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cRaging Bull\u201d  \u2014   is rooted in his childhood. As a boy in Little Italy, he wanted to be a missionary. His parents were not religious, in part because their parents had felt the church\u2019s heavy hand in Sicily, but for him the church  \u2014   a malign force in so many    stories  \u2014   was a portal to the world beyond family and neighborhood. \u201cI trusted the church, because it made sense, what they preached, what they taught,\u201d he said. \u201cI understood that there\u2019s another way to think, outside the closed, hidden, frightened, tough world I grew up in. \u201d The movies, likewise, pointed to the wider world. His father, a presser in the garment district, didn\u2019t make much but always had enough money to take him to the movies. A local TV station broadcast Italian films on Friday nights. He grew up watching the crucial works of Italian neorealism, many of them with a strong Catholic dimension  \u2014   like Roberto Rossellini\u2019s \u201cRome, Open City,\u201d in which a priest is executed for cooperating with the Resistance. The   Catholicism of the area was centered on street processions devoted to saints brought over from the old country: San Gandolfo for the Sicilians on Elizabeth Street, San Gennaro for the Neapolitans on Mulberry Street. \u201cWhen I was there, it was already dying out,\u201d Scorsese told me. It hooked him even so. The vast, vaulted interior of St. Patrick\u2019s Old Cathedral on Mott Street was a sharp contrast to the family\u2019s small apartment, the Latin Mass a formal counterpoint to their mealtime banter. \u201cI think fast, I move fast, and I think it has something to do with the medication I was given for asthma,\u201d Scorsese said. \u201cIt affected the way I breathe, the way I think. I needed to pull back. Film did that for me, and so did the church. They slowed me down. They allowed me to meditate. They gave me a different sense of time. \u201d Francis Principe, a young priest assigned to the neighborhood, brought faith and film together. \u201cHe was the one who opened up things for us,\u201d Scorsese recalled. \u201cWho said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to live this way. You don\u2019t have to follow in this cultural cycle. You don\u2019t have to get married at 21. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Scorsese had become an altar boy, and each year Principe would take the altar boys to a movie uptown  \u2014   \u201cAround the World in 80 Days,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge on the River Kwai\u201d  \u2014   and sit talking about it with them afterward on the steps of the rectory on Mulberry Street. They went to the Roxy near Times Square to see the Gospel drama \u201cThe Robe\u201d and then heard him put it down. \u201cFather Principe detested Christian sentimentality or   religious aspects,\u201d Scorsese said. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018Oh, it\u2019s so clich\u00e9,\u2019 he said, meaning the thunder when Judas mentions his name  \u2014   \u2018My name is Judas,\u2019 and there\u2019s the thunder in stereophonic sound. To this day I haven\u2019t heard thunder as good as that. \u201d And yet  \u2014   at age 11  \u2014   he conceived of the wish to do it differently, \u201cto take the biblical epic to another place. \u201d Faith and film offset the asthma that kept him out of sports and off the streets. Indoors, he drew movie storyboards, including some, a few years later, for a life of Christ. \u201cI set it right in the neighborhood,\u201d he told me, \u201cwith the crucifixion taking place on the West Side piers and the N. Y. P. D. involved. Can you see it?\u201d Indoors, he had a   seat for adult matters, especially his father\u2019s dealings with a spendthrift uncle who seemed to take money from his father freely and with impunity to pay the loan shark. It was a pattern he knew from the Scripture passages read in church. \u201cMy brother\u2019s keeper  \u2014   it\u2019s my brother\u2019s keeper!\u201d he said, chortling with recognition. \u201cAnd it goes beyond your brother. Are we responsible for other people? What is our obligation, when somebody does something that is so upsetting? . .. Do you really have to do it because they\u2019re a brother, or you\u2019re related, or you made vows of marriage? What is the right thing to do for the other person, and for yourself? All of this carried through. I would see it acted out one way in reality, and I would hear it another way from Father Principe and a couple of priests at Cardinal Hayes. \u201d Cardinal Hayes is a high school in the Bronx, and after a year of minor seminary  \u2014   a tryout for the priesthood once a regular stop for bright Catholic boys of limited means  \u2014   Scorsese went there. (Don DeLillo, the novelist, was a few years ahead.) Rejected by Fordham University because of poor grades, Scorsese enrolled at N. Y. U. \u2019s Washington Square College and its film program. From there, he plunged into the \u201960s: a concertgoer at the Fillmore East, an expatriate in England and Holland, an assistant director at Woodstock (he became an editor on the concert film) and then a maker of his own movies  \u2014   \u201cWho\u2019s That Knocking at My Door,\u201d about a young man in the suddenly liberated \u201960s whose Catholic principles keep him out of bed with his girlfriend, and \u201cBoxcar Bertha,\u201d a film about a female   \u201cfree\u2019er than most. \u201d When he returned to Little Italy in 1972 to make \u201cMean Streets,\u201d some of the young men in his generation were stepping into the underworld roles their fathers had occupied. Early in the picture, Charlie, an   mobster played by Harvey Keitel, talks about going to confession in the old cathedral. He wishes he could choose his own penance instead of having one assigned by the priest. He gets his wish, in a way: It falls to him to look out for Johnny Boy, played by Robert De Niro  \u2014   the lost boy of the neighborhood, a reckless gambler who puts them both in danger. Charlie becomes his brother\u2019s keeper  \u2014   and Charlie, eager to rise in the mob, lets his friend dangle without reaching out to the powerful uncle who could save him. Pauline Kael, in The New Yorker, struck a biblical note: \u201cCharlie talks a lot to Johnny Boy about friendship and does nothing. He\u2019s Judas the betrayer. \u201d It is striking to see the brother\u2019  pattern show up at the other end of Scorsese\u2019s career, in \u201cSilence. \u201d As the two Jesuits set out for Japan, they find a translator named Kichijiro in a seedy neighborhood and drag him into their mission. He resists. He drinks himself sick. He lies. He bemoans his fate. A convert, he apostatized and was allowed to live, while the shogunate killed his brothers and sisters. Rodrigues decides that he is Kichijiro\u2019s keeper and grimly bears up as Kichijiro apostatizes again and again and finally betrays him to the shogunate. But as Rodrigues is racked by doubts, the peasant becomes the priest\u2019s keeper, a man whose faith is rooted in his recognition of his own weakness. Who is more Christlike: the person who is strong in faith or the one who is weak, who is humiliated? \u201cHumiliation: That\u2019s the key,\u201d Scorsese told me. \u201cAs Kichijiro says in the movie: \u2018Where is the place for a weak person in the world we\u2019re in? Why wasn\u2019t I born when there wasn\u2019t any persecution? I would have been a great Christian. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d For half a century, Scorsese has been a missionary for the cinema: making his own movies, promoting the work of great international directors, consolidating the history of the medium in a brilliant group of documentaries and advocating for the preservation of classics. Over time, this picture of his about a missionary adventure became a mission in its own right, and the act of getting it made became an act of faith. \u201cI knew he had this script and was terribly disappointed that he couldn\u2019t get it made,\u201d Irwin Winkler, who produced \u201cRaging Bull\u201d and \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d told me. \u201cAnd I thought, What a sad state Hollywood is in when Martin Scorsese, with all his success, with all the honors he\u2019s gotten, can\u2019t get a movie made. \u201d There began an intense collective effort guided by Emma Tillinger Koskoff, the film\u2019s producer, to make the project materialize. Winkler worked through dozens of legal disputes attached to the project. Randall Emmett, a producer, secured new funding, and in 2013 Scorsese and some associates went to Cannes and returned with $21 million in distribution commitments. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever done that before,\u201d Koskoff told me, \u201cbut for this picture he has done a lot of things he hadn\u2019t done before. \u201d He would direct the picture without a fee. All the principal actors  \u2014   Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson  \u2014   have   pedigrees but would work for Screen Actors Guild \u201cscale\u201d or for greatly reduced fees (\u201ca pittance,\u201d Neeson called it, uncomplainingly). Paramount Pictures signed on as the U. S. distributor in 2014. Koskoff and the production designer Dante Ferretti scouted locations in Vancouver, Montreal, the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand. After four trips to Taiwan, they decided that Taiwan it would be  \u2014   for eight months. In all, 750 people, cast and crew and production team, would put their faith in Scorsese\u2019s act of faith. \u201cSilence\u201d is a novel about \u201cthe necessity of belief fighting the voice of experience,\u201d as Scorsese has put it. To get the Jesuits\u2019 beliefs right, he engaged the Rev. James Martin, an author and editor at large of the Jesuit weekly America. Filmmaker and priest had several colloquies at Scorsese\u2019s home, and Martin worked intensively with Garfield and Driver. Just as De Niro learned to box for \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d they familiarized themselves with the rites and disciplines of the Jesuit priesthood to bring authenticity to their performances. Garfield, known for his role in two \u201c \u201d movies, prepared to play Father Rodrigues by entering fully into the process that Jesuits call \u201cspiritual direction. \u201d Raised outside London, with a secular Jewish father, Garfield developed his character by undergoing the \u201cSpiritual Exercises\u201d of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order. The exercises, devised in the 1520s, invite the \u201cexercitant\u201d to use his imagination to place himself in the company of Jesus, at the foot of the cross, among tormented souls in hell. Garfield met with Martin for spiritual direction, and they swapped reflections via email and Skype. Then he set out for St. Beuno\u2019s, a Jesuit house in Wales, to undertake a   silent retreat. \u201cIf I\u2019d had 10 years, it wouldn\u2019t have been enough to prepare for this role,\u201d Garfield told me. \u201cI got totally swept up in all things Jesuit and very taken with Jesuit spirituality. The preparation went on for nearly a year, and by the time we got to Taiwan, it was bursting out of me. \u201d It\u2019s not unusual for performers to allude vaguely to their spirituality. But Garfield describes the process with guileless specificity. \u201cOn retreat, you enter into your imagination to accompany Jesus through his life from his conception to his crucifixion and resurrection. You are walking, talking, praying with Jesus, suffering with him. And it\u2019s devastating to see someone who has been your friend, whom you love, be so brutalized. \u201d Before Garfield left for Taiwan, Martin gave him a cross he had received as a gift while a Jesuit novice. \u201cAndrew got to the point where he could   a Jesuit,\u201d Martin told me. \u201cThere were places in the script where he would stop and say, \u2018A Jesuit wouldn\u2019t say that,\u2019 and we would come up with something else. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I am called to be a priest,\u201d Garfield said to me resolutely, as if making this film had spurred him to consider the prospect. \u201cBut I had the feeling that I was being called to something: called to work with one of the great directors, and called to this role as something I had to pursue for my spiritual development. \u201d Driver has played the unreliable boyfriend in \u201cGirls\u201d and the villainous Kylo Ren in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens. \u201d To play Francisco Garrupe (Garrpe in the novel) Rodrigues\u2019s slightly more skeptical companion, Driver, who was raised a Baptist in Indiana, worked by analogy. \u201cThis movie is the story of a crisis of faith,\u201d he said, and explained that he tried to apply the ideas of faith and doubt generally. \u201cIt could be faith in your work, in the project or in a marriage it could be doubts about the work or the project or the marriage. When you think about it that way, it\u2019s very relatable. \u201d So he related to faith and doubt  \u2014   and he lost nearly a third of his weight for the role. \u201c  pounds,\u201d he told me over black coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s about control, and as an actor you want to have control. But it\u2019s also about suffering: It gives you information you can use in the role. \u201d He lost the weight over four and a half months, supervised by a nutrition coach. Early on, he spent a week at St. Beuno\u2019s. Garfield was already two days into his retreat when Driver arrived at the place, a Victorian Gothic pile where the Jesuit poet Gerard Manley Hopkins was once in residence. Pledged to silence, the two actors waved when they spied each other in the refectory. Liam Neeson, raised Catholic in Ireland, brought to \u201cSilence\u201d the insights he gained during \u201cThe Mission,\u201d Roland Joff\u00e9\u2019s 1986 film about Jesuit adventures in South America. Daniel Berrigan, the Jesuit poet and pacifist, was an adviser to that picture and celebrated Mass with the actors  \u2014   Neeson, De Niro, Jeremy Irons  \u2014   on location in Colombia. Neeson told me: \u201cI remember Father Dan saying, \u2018Do you know that Stanislavski based his \u201cExercises\u201d for actors on the \u201cSpiritual Exercises\u201d of St. Ignatius?\u2019 I\u2019d come all this way to hear that! That had a real effect on me. \u201d This time, in Taiwan to play Father Ferreira  \u2014   the older Jesuit who apostatized after being tortured  \u2014   Neeson underwent a simulacrum of the torture, suspended upside down by ropes over a pit of excreta. The Japanese actor Yoshi Oida, determined to do his best to play a character crucified in the sea, hung on a cross as a wave machine pushed rising tides of water over him. Oida was 82. By the time Driver filmed his final scene  \u2014   in which Garrupe, long unseen, staggers into view, starved by his captors  \u2014   he was hallucinating from hunger. \u201cI did the scene and hopped on a plane to New York to do a table reading for \u2018Girls,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he told me, and then began a regimen of triple breakfasts at a diner in Brooklyn. A. O. Scott, now a chief film critic for The New York Times, once wrote that Scorsese approaches filmmaking as \u201ca priestly avocation, a set of spiritual exercises embedded in technical problems. \u201d So it was with \u201cSilence. \u201d \u201cMarty insists on having silence on the set,\u201d Garfield told me. \u201cThe silence says: \u2018Something is happening here. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Scorsese arranged the shooting script chronologically, so the cast could feel the characters\u2019 emotions in sequence. Finally Garfield reached the scene in which Rodrigues steps on the fumie, profaning the God he believes in and renouncing the faith he has come halfway across the world to preach. Actor and director prepared the shot: a bare foot pressed to a piece of copper, the face of Christ worn smooth by the feet of countless apostates before him. \u201cIt\u2019s something we had both waited for,\u201d Garfield said, \u201cbut Marty had waited much longer  \u2014   he had waited decades to film that scene. \u201d The director was ready the priest stepped  \u2014   and then there was a technical difficulty. \u201cI almost lost my mind, and I think Marty did, too,\u201d Garfield recalled. \u201cHe wanted it to be done in one take. \u201d There was a second take, and the priest profaned the image of Christ once and for all. Step by step, \u201cSilence\u201d got made. The picture Scorsese saw in his head on the bullet train took 27 years and $46. 5 million to realize. \u201cAll in God\u2019s good time,\u201d he said to me philosophically as we sat together in his house in the near dark. It was one o\u2019clock in the morning. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why, but this is how this picture got made. It had to be this way. \u201d Scorsese could speak philosophically, because he had been through all this before. A passion project, religious in nature, based on a novel delays, funding difficulties and reluctance among studio executives: Such was \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ,\u201d his adaptation of the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis. When the novel was published in Athens in 1955, its conceit  \u2014   that Jesus felt a temptation to climb down from the cross and live an earthly life with Mary Magdalene  \u2014   was seen as a challenge to conservative Christianity, represented by the Greek Orthodox Church. By the time it reached the United States in English translation, the \u201960s were on, and the novel was taken up by the counterculture as a template for religious illumination through carnal knowledge. Scorsese read the novel in the \u201970s after it was given to him by Barbara Hershey and David Carradine, the two stars of \u201cBoxcar Bertha. \u201d By the time he set to making a movie adaptation, it was the Reagan era, and the novel was again seen as a challenge to conservative Christianity, then at full volume. Scorsese\u2019s stated aims for the picture were straightforward. He wanted to give the Gospel story a contemporary accent, the way great artists like Caravaggio had done. And he wanted to fulfill his childhood vision and take the biblical epic to a different place. But the project soon turned complicated beyond belief. After committing to the picture in 1983, Paramount Pictures began to have doubts. Scorsese shrank the shooting schedule (planned for Israel) and the budget, agreeing to forgo his fee. As fundamentalist Christian leaders got wind of the project, they organized a hostile   campaign against Paramount\u2019s parent company, Gulf and Western. Salah Hassanein, the head of United Artists, then the     chain, declared that U. A. wouldn\u2019t show the picture on its screens, citing trouble with \u201cThe Life of Brian\u201d and other   films, as well as with a film called \u201cMohammed: Messenger of God\u201d that had prompted bomb threats. In an agonizing meeting with Scorsese and studio executives, Paramount\u2019s chief, Barry Diller, canceled the picture. By now Scorsese\u2019s intentions for it were a good deal more complicated. \u201cI told him that God can\u2019t be only in the hands of the churches,\u201d he later said, recalling the meeting with Hassanein. \u201cThere are so many obstacles in between us and the spirit. In a sense, to make this film was to try to make God accessible to people in the audience who feel alienated from the churches. I said: \u2018I have had three divorces. Does this mean I can\u2019t speak to God because the church says I can\u2019t? No, no! I can talk for myself because I\u2019m me. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Angry and restive, he took on two projects initiated by others: \u201cAfter Hours,\u201d set in Lower Manhattan, and \u201cThe Color of Money,\u201d a   drama starring Paul Newman and Tom Cruise. \u201cThe Color of Money\u201d grossed $52 million: the biggest hit he\u2019d ever had. Emboldened, he switched agents  \u2014   to Newman\u2019s agent, Michael Ovitz, the head of Creative Artists Agency. \u201cMike said: \u2018What is it you want to get done? What is the film you really want to get made?\u2019 I said, \u2018The Last Temptation of Christ.\u2019 And he said, \u2018O. K.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019ve heard that before. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Ovitz swiftly got \u201cLast Temptation\u201d greenlighted at Universal. Scorsese filmed in Morocco with Willem Dafoe as Jesus, Harvey Keitel as Judas, David Bowie as Pontius Pilate and Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene. What happened next still stands as a central episode in the culture wars. As Scorsese worked round the clock to edit the picture, the religious right moved against it. Donald Wildmon, a   instigator and head of the American Family Association, organized a picketing campaign at Universal Pictures in Los Angeles. The Rev. R. L. Hymers Jr. of the Baptist Tabernacle of Los Angeles did the same outside the home of Lew Wasserman, the chairman of MCA, which owned Universal. The leader of the Campus Crusade for Christ, Bill Bright, offered to buy the film from Universal in order to destroy it. Universal moved up the film\u2019s release date and took out   newspaper ads in its support. In an interview with reporters in Rome, the Italian director Franco Zeffirelli, who hadn\u2019t seen the movie, called it \u201ctruly horrible and completely deranged. \u201d Reports attributed to him a remark that the movie was the product of Hollywood\u2019s \u201cJewish scum. \u201d Zeffirelli denied this, but the notion took root that the movie was the sinister work of a cabal of Jewish movie executives conspiring against the Christian faith. The day the film had its premiere at the Ziegfeld  \u2014   Aug. 12, 1988  \u2014   hundreds of picketers were there. So were several television news crews. \u201cAfter the premiere,\u201d Scorsese recalled to me, \u201ca group of us went to dinner at the Regency hotel. \u201d The group included Universal executives the celebrated director Michael Powell Scorsese\u2019s longtime editor and collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker and prominent Christians who had supported the movie. Paul Moore, the Episcopal bishop of New York, had written a letter to The New York Times declaring that the movie dramatized the core church teaching that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine. At the Regency, Moore told Scorsese about a book he should read. The next day he had it sent over: \u201cSilence,\u201d by Shusaku Endo. In Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, China, and elsewhere, the persecution of Christians  \u2014   often to the point of martyrdom  \u2014   is real and continuing. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the word \u201cmartyr\u201d has taken on awful new connotations. \u201cSilence,\u201d then, is inadvertently topical. Like the novel, the picture interrogates the very idea of Christian martyrdom, by proposing that there are instances when martyrdom  \u2014   the believer holding fast to Christ to the bitter end  \u2014   is not holy or even right. It makes in the way of art the arguments made in defense of \u201cLast Temptation\u201d: that an act can\u2019t be fully understood if the intentions behind it aren\u2019t taken into account, and that a seeming act of profanation can be an act of devotion if done out of an underlying faith. At a dramatic moment in the novel, Rodrigues hears the cries of Christians who are being tortured outside his cell. He has been told that he can save their lives if he will step on the fumie. He agonizes. He prays. He feels the offer as a temptation. Weary, hungry, surrounded by suffering and death, he hears a voice he takes to be Jesus: \u201cTrample! It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. \u201d \u201cThe novel poses a very profound theological question,\u201d Peter C. Phan, a Catholic theologian at Georgetown who was born in Vietnam, told me. \u201cThe question is this: Are we allowed to do an essentially evil act to obtain a good result? If it is done to save himself, then the answer is no. But the novel is so complex because he does it for his followers, for the good end of saving his flock. He will go to hell  \u2014   but he will go to hell for their sake. \u201d Rodrigues tramples on the fumie. Because his intention is right  \u2014   to save the lives of others  \u2014   the act seems right. And because it entails the sacrifice of his exalted sense of himself, it seems a Christian act, a loss of self for others\u2019 sake. The novel doesn\u2019t work through theological questions so scholastically. Rather, it enfolds them within other questions: whether missionary activity is ipso facto a form of imperialism, and whether the content of a religious faith is lost in translation when it is promulgated in a new language in a new land. Should the church adapt to particular cultures, or should it maintain an approach distinctively its own? In Christian theology, that is a question of \u201cinculturation. \u201d Since the Council of Jerusalem  \u2014   when the apostles, Jews by birth, clashed over whether new Christians should be held to Jewish law  \u2014   the history of Christianity has turned on questions of inculturation. The brilliance of \u201cSilence\u201d is that it shows how these questions increase and multiply. The young Jesuits seem to favor inculturation, adopting peasant dress, taking the sacraments directly to the people and calling their hut \u201cthe monastery. \u201d A magistrate  \u2014   a figure akin to Dostoyevsky\u2019s Grand Inquisitor  \u2014   tells Rodrigues that Christianity cannot take root in the \u201cswamp\u201d that is Japan. When Rodrigues finally meets him, Ferreira concurs. The converts? They are breakaway Buddhists, the apostate priest says they worship the \u201cSun of God,\u201d not the Son of God. Those martyrs, dying upside down in the pit? They didn\u2019t die for Christ, he tells Rodrigues, they died for you. For all that, \u201cSilence\u201d is itself a complex act of inculturation  \u2014   a novel, featuring a European priest\u2019s point of view, that could not have been written by anyone but a Japanese. The fumie, too, is an expression of inculturation, a point developed in a new book by the artist Makoto Fujimura. It is an image of God devised by the shogunate for the purpose of abuse, but over the course of the novel, it becomes an authentic image of Christ. Under threat, the converts abuse it. They renounce their faith. But that doesn\u2019t mean they stop believing. They keep \u201chidden faith\u201d in mysterious ways. Scorsese\u2019s own body of work is a strong argument for inculturation, in that he instinctively finds religious patterns and images in modern, urban, vulgar, dispirited society. His \u201cSilence\u201d is an act of cultural adaptation (some would call it appropriation) to the third degree: Here an   Catholic adapts a Japanese Catholic\u2019s novel about Portuguese Catholics for a Hollywood movie  \u2014   arguably American culture\u2019s most distinctive art form. And yet Scorsese\u2019s \u201cSilence\u201d suggests that inculturation of the usual kind is impossible. Instead, it makes vivid the idea that the act called apostasy can be a shrewd adaptation of religious faith to a hostile culture, and that faith maintained in spite of a believer\u2019s outward acts of apostasy is faith nonetheless. The question the novel comes down to, then, is this: \u201cAre you a Christian?\u201d This question, posed by Garrpe to the peasant Kichijiro, is one that Rodrigues must answer for himself before he approaches the fumie, and long after he tramples on it. It is a question that cannot be answered for the   believer by the church, or a mentor, or society. The novel is not about a missionary\u2019s struggle with a hostile culture. When the magistrate says as much, Rodrigues denies it: \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018No, no . . . \u2019 Unconsciously the priest raised his voice as he spoke. \u2018My struggle was with Christianity in my own heart. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Before it opens in New York and Los Angeles in December, \u201cSilence\u201d will be screened in Rome for several hundred Jesuits and for cinephiles at the Vatican. It\u2019s no stretch to suppose that Pope Francis, a Jesuit himself, will find a way to be there. Scorsese assuredly will be there, and it\u2019s striking to envision him sitting in the dark with the pope as his new picture plays. Their boyhoods were a lot alike: Six years older, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was brought up in Buenos Aires in a family of Italian immigrants who took him to the movies often, and he grew up cherishing Italian cinema, especially Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Strada\u201d  \u2014   \u201ca film about the possibility of sainthood,\u201d Scorsese calls it. I asked Scorsese how he would describe his work to Pope Francis. He paused, then replied, \u201cI would say that I\u2019ve tried, in my work, to find out how to live life  \u2014   tried to explore what our existence really is and the meaning of it. \u201d One day not long ago, Scorsese stepped out of a black car in front of the old cathedral. He had on an overcoat, a scarf and a   hat. He tightened the scarf, pulled the hat low and stood near the graveyard adjoining the cathedral. \u201cWe used to play    right here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could hide behind the gravestones. You knew which ones were the right size for you. \u201d Little Italy today is largely symbolic territory, like the Vatican within Italy. The old Ravenite Social Club  \u2014   a headquarters for the Gambino crime syndicate  \u2014   is now a Cydwoq \u201c . \u201d Chinatown, once south of Canal Street, extends most of the way up Mott Street. At the Catholic churches, Mass is offered in Vietnamese and Cantonese. Scorsese looked up Mott Street toward Houston Street. \u201cWhere the Korean restaurant is, that used to be a   house. Past it was a funeral home. The funeral procession would come out and bear the coffin along the sidewalk here and into the cathedral. I remember two kids from the neighborhood, 16 or 17  \u2014   they died of cancer, and the families had to be carried from the funeral home to the church, they were so devastated. It was terrible. I\u2019ll never forget it. \u201d Inside the old cathedral, it became clear how literally Scorsese has never forgotten  \u2014   not the splendor of the church, nor the presence of suffering and death, sin and redemption, nearby. The pastor pointed out the details of a renovation: the saints retouched in their original colors, the marble and brass altar fixtures restored to the way they were before a 1970 modernizing effort. Scorsese, who left the neighborhood in 1965, didn\u2019t need a guide. He knew every inch of the place. \u201cPicture an    boy standing right here in a white cassock, reciting a prayer in Latin,\u201d he mused aloud. \u201cThat\u2019s me. \u201d The closing scenes of his \u201cSilence\u201d follow Rodrigues through the decades after he apostatizes. A priest no more, Rodrigues represents the shogunate in its dealings with traders from Europe. What is his inner life? What does he believe? Working from the imagination rather than from the text of the novel, Scorsese found a final image, subtle but not cryptic, for the character\u2019s position  \u2014   and it\u2019s an image that suggests the nature of Scorsese\u2019s own engagement with matters of faith. I asked him to draw a connection between \u201cSilence\u201d and what he was seeing in the old cathedral. He tapped his forehead with two fingers. \u201cThe connection is that it has never been interrupted. It\u2019s continuous. I never left. In my mind, I am here every day. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564397.9856594}
