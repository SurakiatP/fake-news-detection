Most of the posts were ordinary news stories from conservative sites: Donald J. Trump\u2019s deal with the Carrier company. The political tussle over the recount. But a few items were his guilty pleasures. \u201cI like this guy,\u201d said Mr. Laughlin, looking at a post by the conservative commentator and author Mark Dice. Mr. Dice has promoted conspiracy theories that the Jade Helm military training exercise last year was preparation for martial law and that the Sept. 11 attacks were an \u201cinside job. \u201d But Mr. Laughlin likes him for what he said was his humorous political commentary and his sarcastic     interviews. \u201cI just like the satisfaction,\u201d said Mr. Laughlin, who started his own business and lives in an affluent Twin Cities suburb. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hockey game. Everyone\u2019s got their goons. Their goons are pushing our guys around, and it\u2019s great to see our goons push back. \u201d The proliferation of fake and hyperpartisan news that has flooded into Americans\u2019 laptops and living rooms has prompted a national   with liberals across the country asking how a nation of millions could be marching to such a suspect drumbeat. But while some Americans may take the stories literally  \u2014   like the North Carolina man who fired his gun in a Washington pizzeria on Sunday trying to investigate a false story spread online of a   ring led by Hillary Clinton  \u2014   many do not. The larger problem, experts say, is less extreme but more insidious. Fake news, and the proliferation of raw opinion that passes for news, is creating confusion, punching holes in what is true, causing a kind of   effect that leaves the reader doubting everything, including real news. That has pushed up the political temperature and increased polarization. No longer burdened with wrestling with the possibility that they might be wrong, people on the right and the left have become more entrenched in their positions, experts say. In interviews, people said they felt more empowered, more attached to their own side and less inclined to listen to the other. Polarization is fun, like cheering a goal for the home team. \u201cThere are an alarming number of people who tend to be credulous and form beliefs based on the latest thing they\u2019ve read, but that\u2019s not the wider problem,\u201d said Michael Lynch, a professor of philosophy at the University of Connecticut. \u201cThe wider problem is fake news has the effect of getting people not to believe real things. \u201d He described the thinking like this: \u201cThere\u2019s no way for me to know what is objectively true, so we\u2019ll stick to our guns and our own evidence. We\u2019ll ignore the facts because nobody knows what\u2019s really true anyway. \u201d News that is fake or only marginally real has lurked online  \u2014   and in supermarket tabloids  \u2014   for years, but never before has it played such a prominent role in an American election and its aftermath. Narrowly defined, \u201cfake news\u201d means a   story with an intention to deceive, often geared toward getting clicks. But the issue has become a political battering ram, with the left accusing the right of trafficking in disinformation, and the right accusing the left of tarring conservatives as a way to try to censor websites. In the process, the definition of fake news has blurred. \u201cFake news is subjective,\u201d Mr. Laughlin said. \u201cIt depends on who\u2019s defining it. One man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure. \u201d For Mr. Laughlin, conservative sites are a balm for the soul in a liberal world whose narrative of America, he says, seems to diminish him and all that he has accomplished. He was his own legal guardian at 16, after his mother fled his alcoholic father. He built his metal finishing business from scratch after earning an associate degree from a community college. The company he owned employs about 17 people. He and his wife adopted three   children. \u201cMy struggles in life are just dismissed,\u201d he said, recalling being lectured by one of his children\u2019s liberal friends at a party in his large home. \u201c\u2018You have a nice house and got it made because you are a white guy.\u2019 There are all of these preconceived notions that I\u2019m a racist, idiot, a bigot, and oh, uneducated. \u201d He feels alienated from the conventional news media for some of the same reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s like an inside joke for people on the left, and we are the butt of the joke,\u201d he said of one   website. \u201cAt some point, we stopped listening. \u201d Mr. Laughlin likes news that strikes back against that. These days, he takes the most pleasure in watching clips strung together by conservative websites of liberal commentators sneering about how ridiculous Donald J. Trump was as a candidate and how he had no chance at becoming president. \u201cThis is like our sweet release after the election,\u201d Mr. Laughlin said. He said the hyperpartisan environment left him craving intense content. \u201cI\u2019m picking through the fruit and looking for the reddest apple,\u201d he said. But Mr. Laughlin avoids news that looks false, like a story after the election that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, and said he was careful not to click on such items to deny them advertising revenue. He said he cringed when he heard about the incident in the pizza restaurant. \u201cIt adds to the stereotype that we\u2019re all nutters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all get lumped together with this guy. \u201d Adding to the confusion is the fact that Mr. Trump and some members of his team have promoted false items, too, such as that millions of people voted illegally. A similar story had circulated on the site of the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones some days before. For Clayton Montgomery, 57, a retired state department of transportation worker in Waynesville, N. C. the numbers may not be precisely right, but the broad outlines rang true. \u201cAll of a sudden they got this big push of registered voters,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said, referring to California. \u201cThey were all illegals. The same thing in the state of Washington, Los Angeles and Houston, too. \u201d He said that Mr. Jones, who has called the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax, \u201ccan get a little conspiratorial,\u201d but added that he \u201craises some very logical and important questions. \u201d Mr. Montgomery has concerns about immigration. He lived for years in South Florida, where he had a painting business that was deeply affected by cheap labor from Hispanic immigrants. \u201cThey can\u2019t say that these people are not taking jobs away from American citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come up and they lowball. It hurts a lot of people. \u201d Another story online alleged that Mexico had a wall along its southern border \u201cwith guard towers,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said, to keep \u201call these other countries from coming in. \u201d (Mr. Laughlin saw that one, too, but pointed out that the photograph that accompanied the story was from Israel.) Mr. Montgomery pushed back: \u201cCheck it out, it\u2019s true!\u201d Mr. Montgomery said he was nostalgic for the news of old, when Walter Cronkite delivered it. But the reputation of the press has been tarnished, he said, and people are left to navigate the fractured landscape on their own. The online content can be frustrating, with headlines that promise more than the story delivers. He noted one with a headline along the lines of \u201cThe wait is over Hillary\u2019s being indicted. \u201d \u201cBut then you click and there\u2019s nothing in there about her being indicted,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like looking at a menu in a restaurant. Oh, that sounds delicious, it sounds great, and then it\u2019s this teeny weeny thing you maybe get three bites of. \u201d Fake and hyperpartisan news from the right has been more conspicuous than from the left, but both sides indulge. BuzzFeed analyses have found more on the right. Some purveyors have said   items are more profitable. But the left has its share. The   site Snopes said it found no evidence for a quotation, often attributed to Mr. Trump by the left, that Republican voters were stupid. That type of insult increases the partisan divide. Paul Indre, a project manager for a hardware goods company in Akron, Ohio, who gets his news from podcasts and television, avoids much of online news. But he understands why people go there in a polarized era. Mr. Indre, a moderate Republican, said he remained vigilant against fake news. \u201cIf I\u2019m in a Trump group and someone will share something that\u2019s fake news,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll ask them \u2018Hey did you check that? \u2019\u201d But it is often impossible to tell whether \u201cthey are just lobbing a bomb, or do they really believe it?\u201d he said. \u201cYou have some folks who are a little na\u00efve, who don\u2019t follow the news and believe it. I mean, people do buy The National Enquirer and believe it. \u201d \u201cBut some of it might be revenge factor, getting back at something they are hearing from the left,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they are just reacting to something. Maybe we are just in this reactionary period. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561782.8272488}
