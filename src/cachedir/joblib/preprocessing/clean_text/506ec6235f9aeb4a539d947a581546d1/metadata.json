They did their best to retaliate, and, fortunately, the leader of the pack pleaded years later to federal charges of lying to Congress (\u201cHey, doesn\u2019t everybody???!!\u201d) on another matter (Sometimes the chickens do come home to roost.). \\nBut the Mexican corruptos were a different breed. Nobody was going to bring them to justice \u2013 the ruling PRI (then and now) was seamlessly coordinating and cooperating with the drug gangs, the military killers, and the corrupt elites. \\nSeveral years later, I planned to attend a conference in Mexico City \u2013 where I used to live, but had not visited since our hearings. Then, out of nowhere, at a social function, a diplomat from the Embassy of Mexico in Washington approached me and said, \u201cI hear you\u2019re going to Mexico.\u201d (How did she know?) \\n\u201cGo nowhere alone,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cStay in your hotel after dark. Travel only with the other conferees on the bus (she knew everything about this very non-political conference). And NEVER hail a cab!\u201d \\nSo there I was. I couldn\u2019t go to the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe. I couldn\u2019t go visit old friends in their homes. I couldn\u2019t even go look at the house in Colonia Polanco where Stalin\u2019s secret agent from Barcelona killed Leon Trotsky with a pickaxe. \\nSo I asked this generous woman, who was probably risking her career, why she was telling me this. \\n\u201cThey have long memories. They have a kill list. I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d she said. \\nPeriod. \\nThe (im)moral of the story: Death threats are real. So this recent headline caught my attention: \\nDave Schippers, who served as the Chief Investigative Counsel for the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s probe into whether Bill Clinton committed impeachable offenses, is \u201cterrified by Hillary Clinton.\u201d \\nRead it . He wanted to investigate everything, including the corruption, the cattle futures, the murders \u2013 not only Vince Foster\u2019s, but all those folks in Arkansas But he was waved off. He read every single document that had been collected on the breadth and depth of the Clinton Corruption Machine, but he was stiffed by unidentified higher-ups. \\nEver since, he\u2019s watched his back. I\u2019m sure that he can\u2019t walk around alone at night, or hail a cab on a busy street, or take his kids to the park. \\nWhy? Because death threats are real. Ignore them and you die.'"}, "time": 1742628553.5153913}
