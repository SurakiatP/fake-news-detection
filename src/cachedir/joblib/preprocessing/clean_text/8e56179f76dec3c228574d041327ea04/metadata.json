[\u201cLook what he was able to do, look what he was able to build,\u201d Trump marveled as he told the story of Jackson, who was orphaned as a young boy before fighting in the Revolutionary War.  \u201cAndrew Jackson was a military hero and genius and a beloved president, but he was also a flawed and imperfect man, the product of his time,\u201d Trump said. Trump told the story of Jackson being captured by the British during the Revolutionary War as a boy and being slashed with a saber when he refused to shine an officer\u2019s boots. \u201cIt was during the revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDoes that sound familiar to you?\u201d \u201cOh, I know the feeling, Andrew,\u201d Trump smiled as he shook his head. Trump explained that since the event, Jackson defied elites and authority figures throughout his life. \u201cJackson\u2019s victories shook the establishment like an earthquake,\u201d Trump said. He quoted Henry Clay calling Jackson\u2019s victory as president \u201cmortifying\u201d and \u201csickening. \u201d \u201cOh boy, does this sound familiar,\u201d Trump grinned, as the audience laughed loudly.

The president reminded the spectators that he brought the Andrew Jackson portrait into the Oval Office, adding that he can see the Magnolia tree planted on the South Lawn by Jackson. \u201cNow we must work in our time   \u2026     to expand the blessings of America to every citizen in our land and when we do, watch us grow,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will truly be one nation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563923.700698}
