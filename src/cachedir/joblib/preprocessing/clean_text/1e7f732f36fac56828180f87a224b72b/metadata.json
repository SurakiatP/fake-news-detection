Speaking at Cornell University\u2019s Convocation ceremony, Biden conceded that \u201cglobalization has cost some\u201d people their livelihoods\u201d and that is why the last election proved that \u201cplaying to their fears rather than their hopes and better angels\u201d can still be a \u201cpowerful political tool. \u201d He spoke about the \u201cthe forces of populism not only here but around the world\u201d that called \u201cto close our nation\u2019s gates against the challenges of a rapidly changing world. \u201d Though he said the rise of populism was \u201cdisorienting\u201d and \u201cdisheartening,\u201d Biden argued that it was just a \u201ctemporary state of affairs. \u201d Biden then implied that Trump, in the last election, \u201cchurned up some of the ugliest realities that still remain in our country\u201d along with the \u201ccoarsest rhetoric\u201d and \u201cdarkest emotions. \u201d \u201cI thought we had passed the days where it was acceptable for political leaders at local and national levels to bestow legitimacy on hate speech and fringe ideologies,\u201d Biden said. He said since the \u201cworld is changing so rapidly, there are a lot of folks out there who both are afraid and susceptible to this kind of negative appeal. \u201d \u201cThe immigrant, the minority, the transgender \u2014  anyone not like me became a scapegoat,\u201d Biden said, again taking swipes at Trump without naming him. \u201cJust build a wall. Keep Muslims from coming into the United States. \u201d He also urged the graduating seniors to \u201cfight the urge to build a     and   echo chamber of yourself online. \u201d \u201cLiving in your screens encourages shallow and antiseptic relationships that make it too easy to reduce the other to stereotypes,\u201d he said. Last week, Biden, who may decide to run for president in 2020 and would need strong support from black Democrats if he does indeed make a run at the White House, echoed similar themes when he addressed graduates of Morgan State University, a historically black college. Biden implied that Trump stoked \u201cour darkest emotions\u201d and added that \u201cwe saw just how much of a grip racism and sexism has on America\u201d in the last election, \u201cEven you were surprised that by the way racism was embraced as a political tool on a national level,\u201d Biden told the students at the historically black college. Biden told the audience that \u201cblack lives do matter\u201d and \u201cit has to be said. I\u2019m not being solicitous. \u201d The former vice president said last week that racism \u201cis still deeply embedded in our culture\u201d and spoke about racism in police departments, education, housing, and the hiring process. \u201cNo one has to tell you about the daily indignities of discrimination,\u201d Biden said, telling the graduates that he knew they lived it in \u201csubtle ways. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563563.6977723}
