Lovecraft to my    Penny, and also showed her \u201cJaws\u201d and \u201cAlien,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t until I took her to a comedy club that I felt truly irresponsible. Parental guilt started sinking in after I persuaded a skeptical ticket taker at Carolines on Broadway to let a child see a headliner one Friday this month. As we waited for the opening acts to finish before we entered, I considered the many kinds of jokes I would not want Penny to hear and the years of therapy required to repair the damage. Noticing my mounting anxiety, she asked, \u201cDaddy, are you about to make a mistake?\u201d I answered honestly: \u201cMaybe. \u201d At a time when   heroes dominate Hollywood, cartoon characters regularly invade Broadway and kids\u2019 karaoke entertains crowds of thousands, live   remains stubbornly  . Few clubs are for all ages, and there is no   version of the singer Dan Zanes, a star for young audiences. Why do   comics cede this market to clowns and magicians? Would kids even like performers holding microphones telling jokes onstage? Seeking some answers, I took my daughter to shows looking for comedians she would find funny and I wouldn\u2019t find inappropriate. The comic most likely to bridge the gap between adults and children is Jim Gaffigan, who along with Brian Regan is the greatest clean comic working today. He\u2019s so   that he has performed for the pope, which also may be why he is not considered as cool as some of his peers. My daughter thought he was hilarious, although she took some time to warm up to him. Mr. Gaffigan tells jokes that kids can relate to with many references they understand. At a recent show at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Conn. he did a bit about the horribleness of \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d and another about the laziness of the grandfather in \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory. \u201d And in line with the trend, he did material from the perspective of a cranky parent. When he joked about his own children, what I considered funny Penny saw as punching down. \u201cHe\u2019s funny, but that\u2019s mean,\u201d she said in a debrief after the show, her hands balling up into fists. What put him back in her favor was a story he told in which he \u201cwet himself. \u201d Peeing, pooping and farting are comedy classics, at least a little funny to anyone honest with themselves. But what made this delightful for Penny was that it was an adult who had the accident. \u201cKids sometimes pee on themselves and   don\u2019t like that,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo when a   pees on himself, it\u2019s funny. \u201d Mr. Gaffigan\u2019s intricately delivered jokes about his gluttony and sloth have the crisply simple incongruities and   that any child can appreciate. When he said that his New Year\u2019s resolution was to eat pasta every day, Penny raised her hand to her mouth to muffle her laughter. When he talked about men being gross, she whispered to me, \u201cBut he is a man. \u201d After saying he\u2019s a character actor, Mr. Gaffigan paused, adding that is \u201csecret code for ugly. \u201d Penny doubled over laughing, even though she had no idea what \u201ccharacter actor\u201d meant. Jokes, of course, can be funny if you don\u2019t understand every word, a truth kids grasp better than adults do. \u201cSecret codes are just fun,\u201d she said, matter of fact. Mr. Gaffigan\u2019s show had gone so well that I decided to be more ambitious by taking Penny to Carolines the next night to see the charming rising comic Ron Funches. He is not as clean but has a twee, giggly delivery that I thought might appeal. It was a bad miscalculation. When I didn\u2019t have my hands over her ears, in response to jokes with more cursing or sexual innuendo than I could handle, she was usually just confused. Staring blankly at a bit by Mr. Funches about spending more money than he has, Penny said, \u201cI don\u2019t get any of this. \u201d We left early. In retrospect, taking a child to a New York comedy club on a weekend was overly optimistic if not downright foolish. To make sure that a show is appropriate, it\u2019s best to check with the theater in advance. I did that before seeing a set at the Peoples Improv Theater in Manhattan by the sharp New York comic Aparna Nancherla, in a new monthly show called \u201cShe Makes Me Laugh,\u201d hosted by Laura Zabolotsky, Ashley Lara and Maria Bobila. Ms. Nancherla, whose new album is \u201cJust Putting It Out There,\u201d did a series of jokes commenting on slides projected on the wall.   offers less visual stimulation than movies or musicals, and this set proved that a few images go a long way. Sitting in the front row, Penny was rapt during a bit poking fun at different kinds of author photos, laughing merrily at a shot of a jovial guy wearing a book like a hat. Ms. Nancherla called the look Bookhead. Midway through her set, however, the slides froze and the comic was left onstage with nothing to play off. Struggling to save her set, she made up a few jokes on the spot about the slide frozen onscreen (which as it happened just said \u201cdad\u201d) before prematurely ending the show. Penny was disappointed, but liked the improvisation. \u201cIt was fun to watch her make stuff up,\u201d she said, which may help explain why it\u2019s easier to find improv for children than  . \u201cI wanted the whole thing like that. \u201d By the end of my weeklong experiment, I hadn\u2019t convinced my daughter that   comedy is better than a Harry Potter movie, but she had a good time at two of the three shows. Kids are individuals, with their own taste, but the greatest   comedy taps into some of the same things that the most popular children\u2019s books do: delight in language, the purely silly and a grand sense of mischief. There\u2019s a reasonable concern that reaching for a   brand of comedy would water down the form if not compromise its essence. But aesthetic diversity is a hallmark of comedy today and a Jerry Seinfeld for children does not threaten Jerry Seinfeld. Children have always devoured    \u2014   I fell in love with comedy when I was around my daughter\u2019s age, spending hours trying to understand the jokes on my older brother\u2019s Steve Martin album  \u2014   but the accessibility of the internet has expanded the audience. It\u2019s only a matter of time before some savvy person makes a fortune catering to this demographic. On the taxi ride home from the Peoples Improv Theater, Penny offered this potential producer some advice. \u201cDo shows earlier,\u201d she said, smiling hours past her bedtime. \u201cAnd there should also be more making fun of  . \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562531.5008688}
