Also, a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report exposing significant refund fraud has \u201cmost certainly contributed to it,\u201d says the taxpayer advocate department within the IRS. [The Internal Revenue Service stated that millions of people who do not have Social Security numbers (SSN) most of these illegal aliens, filed federal tax returns last year, reported NPR the day before the tax deadline. Many of those who are ineligible for SSN use \u201cITIN,\u201d or Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers when filing.  The Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, reports that \u201cWithout ITINs, approximately 4. 6 million taxpayers would not be able to comply with their annual tax filing and payment obligations, or receive tax benefits to which they are legally entitled. \u201d The advocate service states that ITIN applications and \u201cassociated return filings\u201d \u201chave dropped precipitously, down 58 percent between 2011 and 2014. \u201d They write that the \u201cgeneral economic climate and immigration trends\u201d explain part of this drop, but the \u201cIRS ITIN procedures have most certainly contributed to it. \u201d After the TIGTA report \u201calleging significant refund fraud connected to ITINS,\u201d in 2012 the IRS made what its independent advocacy service calls \u201csweeping changes that require applicants to submit original identification documents (subject to a few alternatives). \u201d The IRS has also continued its policy of requiring applicants to apply for an ITIN with a paper tax return. The new requirements led to delays for the ITIN applicants and associated large backlogs, the Taxpayer Advocate Services says. The independent arm charges that \u201cWhile concerns about refund fraud are legitimate, the IRS\u2019s solutions do not effectively target the fraud nor do they balance the   regime with the taxpayer\u2019s need for a process no more intrusive than necessary, part of a taxpayer\u2019s right to privacy. \u201d Moreover, NPR reported that tax preparers in the sanctuary city San Francisco area told them there is approximately a 20 percent decline in the number of people filing with ITIN numbers. A tax law professor at the University of Nevada said that tax preparers in other parts of the United States are making similar claims. \u201cSending in a tax return with your current address and information is very unnerving to a population that wants to comply with the law and is actually leaving significant refunds on the table by not filing tax returns,\u201d educator Francine Lipman said. The IRS is barred from giving information it has obtained to other United States agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. They may share information only under \u201climited circumstances\u201d NPR reported. The professor says that those bearing ITIN numbers must decide \u201cwhether to trust that firewall. \u201d \u201cMany of our clients are telling us that in years past they felt more hope and more of ability to have a pathway toward citizenship and lately there\u2019s a lot less hope,\u201d Max   the head of a tax program at the Mission Economic Development Agency told NPR.
