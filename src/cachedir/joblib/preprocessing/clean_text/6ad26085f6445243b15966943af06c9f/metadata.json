[In their post entitled \u201cThe Kids Are  : The UC Berkeley Students Behind the Milo Event,\u201d the   website and group known as \u201cIt\u2019s Going Down\u201d posted the personal details of five student organizers in an attempt to intimidate and harass those behind MILO\u2019s upcoming event on February 1st.  IGD listed the organizers\u2019 names and pictures, supposedly taken after stalking the students\u2019 private social media accounts, and attempted to link many of the students to white supremacy and racism purely based on their   Trump and Republican stances. The group even referred to one of the students as a \u201csnitch\u201d due to the fact that he had reported a violent incident to the police, after he was assaulted by   protesters and had his property destroyed. After attacking another student, citing the various comedy meme pages on Facebook he likes, the group proceeded to write \u201cThis is where [the student] works,\u201d along with the full address, phone number, and website of his employers. \u201cWhile not every member of BCR seems to be directly connected with   politics, at the same time, they are still involved in promoting a political party that holds the most reactionary, racist, and ecocidal platform in history,\u201d noted the organization at the end of their post, despite attempting to link every student organizer to white supremacy just shortly beforehand. \u201cWhile the institutional Left of Berkeley and the wider bay area, which has a stranglehold on the region, deserves no free pass, nor do the Republicans, as one of the two managers of the plantation that is America. \u201d \u201cThe white nationalists at its edges of this system are just the crystallization of the larger politics that has been mainstreamed under Trump that white supremacy needs to be strengthened in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement and other popular struggles from below\u201d they continued. \u201cIt\u2019s up to all of us to realize that both the auxiliary force to the State of the white nationalist   it\u2019s \u2018hipster\u2019 reactionary talking heads like Milo, and the \u2018respectable\u2019 Republican party they seek to influence and defend, are all our enemies. Let\u2019s start treating them as such and organize accordingly. \u201d Despite orchestrating a harassment campaign against the student organizers of MILO\u2019s event, and urging readers to start treating Republicans as \u201cenemies,\u201d the group claims in their about page to \u201cnot condone or promote illegal, violent, and unlawful behavior or actions, or acts of intimidation against individuals or groups. \u201d \u201cIt is a dangerous precedent in an academic environment for student groups to be subjected to harassment and cyber doxxing based on political affiliation,\u201d said the President of the Associated Students of the University of California, Will Morrow. \u201cThis goes beyond any singular political frame or any one event context  \u2014   rather this is something that the foundation of our university is in many ways built on. \u201d \u201cThe article is wrong in the moral sense and in the factual sense,\u201d said Matt Ronnau, who was listed in the post, but claims to have not been involved in organizing MILO\u2019s event. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t know (that I was named) I thought it would be interesting but then seeing my information on there was   \u2026     a little scary. \u201d Another student listed, Nick Winterer, claimed that he wasn\u2019t even associated with the Berkeley College Republicans, and instead used to be affiliated with the Cal Students for Liberty \u2014   a group he is no longer active with. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve been affected in any way by my information being posted,\u201d said Winterer. \u201cI will say that I find it disrespectful that no attempt was made to verify the accuracy of the information posted. \u201d It\u2019s Going Down (IGD) also falsely claimed in the post that the #GamerGate consumer revolt movement was a harassment campaign against women where men made \u201cthreats of rape and sexual assault,\u201d against feminists. They also attempted to falsely associate both Breitbart News and MILO with white nationalism and racism. Several of the affected students have either deleted or hidden their Facebook accounts which were linked in the article. College administrators at UC Berkeley issued the student organizers with a sudden large security fee this week, demanding $6, 370 less than a month before the event \u2014   a tactic frequently used by universities in an attempt to get the event cancelled. In addition to the security fee issue, a group of professors at UC Berkeley are attempting to get MILO banned from the campus, falsely accusing the Breitbart senior editor of advocating \u201cwhite supremacy. \u201d Though the professors claimed to support freedom of speech and \u201copen debate\u201d in their letter, they declared MILO to be an exception, and called upon Chancellor Dirks to ban him from campus. UPDATE: IGD responded to Breitbart\u2019s request for comment, defending the piece by claiming that they merely published an article written by someone else. \u201cF*ck you,\u201d they then concluded in the email. This story has been updated to list the correct position of student Will Morrow. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
