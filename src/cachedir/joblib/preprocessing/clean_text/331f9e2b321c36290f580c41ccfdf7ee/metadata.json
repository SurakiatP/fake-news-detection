However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty.\u201d \\nGruber said, \u201cObamacare\u2019s not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two-fold. One was to cover the uninsured, of which we\u2019ve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in american history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurors could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare.\u201d \\nWhen asked about the 22% Obamacare premium increases, Gruber stated, \u201cthe 22% increase, let\u2019s remember who that applies to. That applies to a very small fraction of people, who have to buy insurance without the subsidies that are available.\u201d\u2026'"}, "time": 1742628492.1560452}
