In May, he published a book, \u201cWho Rules The World?,\u201d which examines similar themes.\\nWatch \u2018 Noam Chomsky: Who Owns the World? Resistance and Ways Forward \u2018 :\\nHe revisited the topic in a recent conversation with Zain Raza, a senior editor at the independent media outlet acTVism Munich. An excerpt from that conversation was published on Tuesday as part of acTVism Munich\u2019s \u201cReexamining History\u201d series .\\nMuch of the U.S. government\u2019s global strategy both during and after World War II was based on a plan proposed by the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations , which Chomsky describes as the \u201cmajor, non-governmental institution concerned with foreign affairs\u201d whose membership \u201cdraws from a wide range of elite elements, business, politics, academics, and so on.\u201d\\nBetween 1939 and 1945, the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations held regular strategy meetings to develop a post-war economic plan. These meetings led to proposal under which the United States would dominate a vast swath of the globe that came to be known as the \u201cGrand Area,\u201d Chomsky said. Explaining that the \u201cGrand Area\u201d would include \u201cthe Western Hemisphere,\u201d Chomsky said:\\n\u201cIt included the former British Empire, which the U.S. was intending to largely take over, maybe Britain would be a junior partner. And as much of Europe, the commercial and industrial center of Europe, as much of that as possible. Certainly Western Europe, its industrial, technological, commercial center.\u201d\\nWithin the \u201cGrand Area,\u201d Chomsky continued, \u201cthe United States would have pretty much complete economic and political control.\u201d\\nWith the collapse of the German economy after the war, and amid the beginnings of the Cold War with Russia and China, the United States was in a unique position to implement this plan. Chomsky said:\\n\u201cThe war was very beneficial to the U.S. economy. Its industrial production virtually quadrupled, wartime spending ended the Depression, which had not been ended before \u2014 enormous stimulus to the economy. The technology that was developed just laid the basis for post-war growth. In that context \u2018Grand Area\u2019 planning of the kind I described was by no means unrealistic.\u201d\\nFar from a Pentagon pipedream, the \u201cGrand Area\u201d became concrete U.S. foreign policy, and its effects linger to this day.\\n\u201cIf you look at the policies implemented and developed in the early post-war period, they follow these prescriptions pretty closely,\u201d Chomsky said.\\nAs Chomsky and other historians have observed, Washington\u2019s plans to dominate the \u201cGrand Area\u201d led directly to the Vietnam War. They were also crucial in the development of the International Monetary Fund , which continues to disrupt global economies for the benefit of multinational corporations and the military-industrial complex.\\nWatch \u2018 Reexamining History with Noam Chomsky: New World Order & the Grand Area \u2018:'"}, "time": 1742628557.2576942}
