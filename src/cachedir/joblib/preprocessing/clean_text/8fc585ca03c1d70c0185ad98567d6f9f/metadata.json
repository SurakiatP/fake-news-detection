I just wanted to be doused in petrol and consumed by a raging hot fire, like any other of my kind,\u201d added the pallet, who admitted at least a third of him was moderately soggy after being discarded in a puddle. \\n\u201cUgh, what\u2019s the point anymore, it\u2019s going to rain so much between now and next Halloween, I\u2019ll be rotten and unlovable by then,\u201d the pallet concluded, full of anguish. \\nThere is some hope for the pallet, however, as a local hipster restaurant which has just opened in the city needs something to serve its food on that isn\u2019t a plate.'"}, "time": 1742628557.9467163}
