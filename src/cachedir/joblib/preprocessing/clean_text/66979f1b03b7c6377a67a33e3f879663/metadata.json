There was a carnival atmosphere with people in costumes, including one   man with a sign, \u201cDon\u2019t let the   media elect crooked Hillary. \u201d A cavalcade of motorcycles roared up, and there were cheers and laughter for a man shouting, \u201cDonald Trump is going to make America great! He hasn\u2019t paid taxes in 20 years!\u201d A day after Mr. Trump defended himself at the second presidential debate for making vulgar comments about women, amid a wave of polls showing an increasing lead for Hillary Clinton, thousands of Trump supporters turned out with undimmed fervor for the Republican nominee and optimism about his electoral prospects. They echoed nearly verbatim Mr. Trump\u2019s defense that his lewd comments about women on a 2005 recording were merely \u201clocker room talk,\u201d calling them harmless words compared with the   actions Mrs. Clinton and her husband had taken to shame women. They reiterated Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that national polls showing him behind by double digits were \u201crigged\u201d and that he was heading to victory in November. In the campaign\u2019s last weeks, at such rallies, Mr. Trump is sealed in a hermetic bubble with his most fervent supporters. They are people passionate enough to wait hours to attend a rally where the candidate and the crowds draw energy and affirmation from each other, while dismissing any discouraging information. His supporters routinely pointed, as the nominee did, to the huge crowds still flocking to see him as evidence that his campaign remains strong. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything the media says,\u201d said Brad Chilson, 47, a truck driver from Bradford County, Pa. who waited hours with his wife outside the   Mohegan Sun Arena in   for Mr. Trump. \u201cLook at the turnout we\u2019ve got here. \u201d Mr. Trump was in high spirits on Monday night in northeastern Pennsylvania, in the heart of a largely white,   region that he has visited regularly, running a campaign sustained by a visceral feel for his audience while ignoring abstractions like data and research. \u201cI think the state of Pennsylvania, we\u2019re going to win so big,\u201d he said. A New York Times polling average shows Mrs. Clinton 7. 2 percentage points ahead in the state. \u201cEverybody in Pennsylvania wants Trump, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get crowds like this everywhere. \u201d He boasted of a rally planned for Florida with an expected 25, 000 people. As he spoke, Katie Packer, a strategist for Mitt Romney in 2012, posted a photograph on Twitter of 30, 000 people at an Ohio rally four years ago a week before Mr. Romney\u2019s defeat. \u201cNone of the Trump crowds so far in the general election surpass what we regularly had in \u201912,\u201d Ms. Packer wrote. \u201cThey are so na\u00efve. \u201d Yet Mr. Trump whipped the crowd to anger at the news media and its \u201ccrooked\u201d polls. At one point, he falsely claimed that CNN had turned off its live coverage as he was accusing the network of manipulating a   focus group. The crowd then chanted an   epithet. He also read the results of unscientific,   online surveys. \u201cTrump 70, Clinton 30,\u201d Mr. Trump quoted from a reader survey by the Drudge Report on which candidate had won the second debate. \u201cOh, listen to this,\u201d he said, reading from an iPhone. \u201cTime magazine. You think Time magazine likes me?\u201d He cited the result: 89 for Trump, 11 for Clinton. \u201cOh, here\u2019s a good one,\u201d he added. \u201cWell, they\u2019re slightly conservative  \u2014   Breitbart. 93 to 7,\u201d he read. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters who were waiting to hear him speak cited alternative sources of information they preferred, dismissing even Fox News in favor of emails from   commentators like Allen B. West, a former congressman, and Dennis Lynch, who makes films about illegal immigration. They also repeated conspiracy theories that flourish online. \u201cA lot of people affiliated with Hillary have died over the years, and nobody says nothing about it,\u201d said Eric Bulger, a retired police officer with the Port Authority for New York and New Jersey. There were equal numbers of women and men at the rally, and many dismissed as insignificant Mr. Trump\u2019s private comments, caught on the 2005 recording, about being able to grab women by their genitals because he was a \u201cstar. \u201d \u201cWhen all this baloney came out about Trump, I understand it\u2019s a scandal,\u201d said Brenda Stchur, 56, a Democrat from Hudson, Pa. who supports Mr. Trump. \u201cBut John F. Kennedy wasn\u2019t innocent, either, and everyone loves John F. Kennedy. \u201d Marilyn Sevigny, a retiree from Lake Ariel, Pa. said that \u201cas a woman, I don\u2019t like what he said, I\u2019m not defending it. \u201d But she added that there was a double standard at work. \u201cIf a Democrat says it, it\u2019s just words. If a Republican says it, it\u2019s an assault,\u201d she said. Before Sunday\u2019s town   debate, David Quinn, an electronics engineer, told his wife that Mr. Trump should drop out, as some senior elected Republicans were calling on the candidate to do. But Mr. Quinn changed his mind, he said, after Mr. Trump\u2019s apology for his comments from 11 years ago. \u201cThe only thing that tape shows is he\u2019s a healthy heterosexual,\u201d he said. Those at the rally agreed that Mr. Trump had won the debate. Many cited as their favorite moment Mr. Trump\u2019s retort that Mrs. Clinton would \u201cbe in jail\u201d if he were president. They dismissed the F. B. I. \u2019s recommendation that Mrs. Clinton should not be prosecuted over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. They faulted the news media for not highlighting that Mrs. Clinton had deleted thousands of emails after receiving a congressional subpoena, as Mr. Trump charged in the debate. Mike Pisano, 65, a factory worker, echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that Mrs. Clinton had escaped indictment because Bill Clinton had met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \u201cHe was on the plane with her fixing that,\u201d Mr. Pisano said. Still, outside the bubble of such devoted followers, Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects in northeastern Pennsylvania are less certain. On  \u2019s Public Square, whose sidewalks filled during lunch hour on Monday, several Republicans and   Democrats said they were appalled by Mr. Trump and would skip the election, or vote for a   candidate. \u201cI just think he\u2019s a pig,\u201d said Janice Kontur, 44, a registered Republican, who manages an apartment complex. She said she could not bring herself to vote for Mrs. Clinton and planned to sit out Election Day. \u201cAs a matter of fact, if he\u2019s elected, me and my daughter will be moving to a different country,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump. Melinda Thompson, a controller for an insurance company, said she would vote for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. She said of Mr. Trump, \u201cI think his temperament would backfire on the United States. \u201d Paul Galante, a lawyer on a smoking break across from a statue of Christopher Columbus, said he was a registered Democrat but had consistently voted for Republican presidential nominees. Not this year. \u201cAll people want is a reason to like the man, and he doesn\u2019t give them a reason,\u201d he said of Mr. Trump. He called the Republican Party \u201ca joke\u201d for nominating Mr. Trump from a field of 17. In the primary, Mr. Galante wrote in a protest candidate, and he is considering voting for Mrs. Clinton in November. \u201cShe\u2019s a sneak and a liar,\u201d he said. \u201cBut so what at this point? He\u2019s worse. \u201d The Trump campaign is counting on doing well in the   region, where factories have closed and the presence of   immigrants has caused tensions. But Mr. Galante, a longtime resident, was deeply skeptical of Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get slaughtered,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564297.2626534}
