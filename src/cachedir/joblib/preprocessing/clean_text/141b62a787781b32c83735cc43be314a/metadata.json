Deval Patrick of Massachusetts on the campaign trail in 2008 when he used Patrick\u2019s signature line, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me words don\u2019t matter. \u201d[Jeff Zeleny, then of the New York Times, wrote:  Senator Barack Obama adapted one of his signature arguments  \u2014   that his oratory amounts to more than inspiring words  \u2014   from speeches given by Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts during his 2006 campaign. At a Democratic Party dinner Saturday in Wisconsin, Mr. Obama, of Illinois, responded to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who has criticized him for delivering smooth speeches but says they do not amount to solutions to the nation\u2019s problems, by ticking through a string of historic references. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me words don\u2019t matter,\u201d Mr. Obama said, to applause. \u201c \u2018I have a dream\u2019  \u2014   just words? \u2018We hold these truths to be   that all men are created equal\u2019  \u2014   just words? \u2018We have nothing to fear but fear itself\u2019  \u2014   just words? Just speeches?\u201d Mr. Patrick employed similar language during his 2006 governor\u2019s race when his Republican rival, Kerry Healey, criticized him as offering lofty rhetoric over specifics. Mr. Patrick has endorsed Mr. Obama, and the two men are close friends.  . Hillary Clinton ( ) seized on Obama\u2019s copying, as the USA Today reported: Hillary Rodham Clinton accused presidential rival Barack Obama of political plagiarism Thursday night, but drew boos from a Democratic debate audience when she ridiculed him as the candidate of \u201cchange you can Xerox. \u201d Obama dismissed the charge out of hand, then turned the jeers to applause when he countered, \u201cWhat we shouldn\u2019t be spending time doing is tearing each other down. We should be spending time lifting the country up. \u201d It was a clear case of plagiarism  \u2014   and an ironic one, given that it centered around a phrase promoting the importance of words. In the end, Gov. Patrick excused his friend, and Democrats excused Obama, as they would for most things. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
