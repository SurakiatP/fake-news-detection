Check back for updates through the end of the Islamic holy month on June 24. [With only days left in this year\u2019s holiest month for Muslims, the fatalities at 1, 434 have more than tripled the estimated 421 that took place during the entire Ramadan period last year, considered one of the bloodiest in recent memory.  The 2, 794 total number of casualties (1, 434 murders and 1, 360 injuries) have more than doubled the estimated 1, 150 (421 deaths and 729 injuries that took place in 2016. There have been nearly 140 incidents in more than 20 mainly Muslim nations during Ramadan this year, which began on May 27 and expected to end on June 24. In an audio message released last week purporting to originate from the Islamic State ( ) the jihadist group again urges its followers and sympathizers to launch terrorist attacks in the United States, Europe, Russia, Australia, Iraq, Syria, Iran, and the Philippines during the ongoing Islamic holy month. ISIS has issued multiple messages urging violent attacks during Ramadan. Consistent with the years since the group surfaced in 2014, ISIS, including its Boko Haram affiliate, takes the grim title of the world\u2019s most prolific terrorist group during Ramadan 2017. ISIS has been linked to more than 90 of the nearly 140 incidents (about 65 percent) so far, with about three days left of the holy month. The Taliban, as well as   and its offshoots, have also been involved in the killing and murder of mainly fellow Muslims. This deaths during this year\u2019s Ramadan have exceeded those from the same period in 2016, considered the deadliest holy month in recent memory. During Ramadan, the majority of Muslims follow the tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset. However, extremists perceive Ramadan as a time when martyrdom and jihad are especially rewarded in paradise, prompting a spike in the terrorist attacks during the period every year. Islamic extremist groups encourage martyrdom among their sympathizers and followers, promoting the belief that they will be doubly rewarded if they fatally castigate infidels during Ramadan. In previous years, the fatalities have included women, children, and members of the Christian, minority. This year is no exception. Although Muslims of all sects make up the majority, there are members of a wide variety of ethnic and religious groups among the victims: Westerners, Christians, Asians, Sunnis, Shiites, and Arabs, among others. The West has not been immune to the Islamic extremists\u2019 call to massacre during Ramadan. Breitbart News\u2019 count, gleaned from the Religion of Peace website in coordination with news reports, excludes casualties directly linked to battles between U. S.  coalition and   and   troops loyal to dictator Bashar  . The total number of Ramadan deaths and injuries could be higher.
