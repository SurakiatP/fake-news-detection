Now, I may not act on everything little thing that \u201cpops\u201d up, so-to-speak, but I definitely notice! A stray eyebrow hair? Yeah, I see you there. A little pimple: how could I miss it? But none of these things compare to the feeling of finding a little patch of nasty blackheads popping up. I get them around my chin and nose. And, honestly, I really don\u2019t know how to effectively deal with them at home. So, I end up popping them. Anyone who has ever done this knows that nine times out of ten, popped blackhead will turn into something way worse! I got sick of the whole process. Get rid of a blackhead to get a pimple instead? No thanks. So that\u2019s why I got really excited to see a natural remedy I could try at home. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll definitely want to check this out, too. When you try it, make sure to snap a pic and upload it in the comments so everyone can see how awesome this blackhead mask is in action! Here is how you transform your face for the better\u2013naturally! 1. Get the ingredients: milk and gelatin. \\nSince you\u2019ll be putting these things directly on your face, I highly recommend choosing high-quality options here. Also, make sure the gelatin is unflavored. 2. Measure, then mix. \\nPut the gelatin (1 Tablespoon) in a container first, then add the milk (1-2 Tablespoons). Mix. 3. Rinse your face while microwaving the mix for 15 seconds. \\nThe heat makes this mix so soft. You\u2019ll want to put it on straight away to ensure the desired smoothness. 4. Apply the warm mixture to your face. \\nYou can spread this mix all over or do some spot treatments \u2014 your choice. Just remember to use it quickly! 5. Let it soak in! \\nGrab your smartphone; you\u2019ve got about 15 minutes to spare here. Better yet, take note and make some funny faces in the mirror. 6. Start peeling away those nasties! \\nOnce it\u2019s dry, grab a corner and start slowing peeling. Get ready to be amazed! 7. Pull! Make sure to get them all! \\nThis is the most satisfying part \u2014 seeing all those disgusting blackheads meet their fate. \\nSource:'"}, "time": 1742562267.998351}
