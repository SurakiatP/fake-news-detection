Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has been buoyed by a torrent of small donations over the past month that nearly evened the financial playing field with Mrs. Clinton. His war chest now boasts $74 million in cash. Still, the Republicans\u2019 disarray was on display as Mike Pence, the   nominee, endorsed Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s   bid a day after Mr. Trump declined to. _____ 2. Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies often stir strong emotions, but one aspect sets them apart from other political gatherings: the frequency with which his supporters use coarse and violent language. The video sampling above captures a range of the vulgarities and racial and ethnic slurs that have sometimes characterized Trump events. _____ 3. The hacks that infiltrated computer systems on the Democratic side have made \u201celection cybersecurity\u201d a new focus for the Department of Homeland Security. Intelligence agencies have told the White House they have a high degree of confidence that Russia was behind the breaches. Above, Hillary Clinton campaigned in Colorado. _____ 4. From a prison in Germany, a former ISIS member gave our reporter a detailed account of his rapid disillusionment with the group in Syria and his escape from its clutches. (Watch the video, above.) His experience, including being urged by masked men to return to Germany to spearhead attacks there, adds insight into how a unit of the Islamic State, called the Emni, exports terror abroad. For Americans, he said, the unit prefers to recruit over the internet: \u201cThey say we can radicalize them easily, and if they have no prior record, they can buy guns. \u201d _____ 5. India overhauled its tangled tax code, a major victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi that economists say should significantly boost the country\u2019s growth rate. \u201cThis is hugely consequential for the ease of doing business,\u201d an analyst said, \u201cand for demonstrating to the outside world that India is dragging its economy into the 21st century. \u201d _____ 6. A study of two insular farming communities in the U. S.  \u2014   the Amish of Indiana and the Hutterites of North Dakota  \u2014   strongly suggests exposure to microbes from farm animals can lower asthma and allergy rates. The results were so compelling that a discussion is already underway on developing a microbial spray that could prompt many more children to develop immune systems that can sidestep asthma. _____ 7. Barbra Streisand, 74, may be reclusive, but she\u2019s not idle. The megastar is about to issue a   new album (\u201cEncore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway\u201d) embarking on a   concert tour (\u201cThe Music   \u2026     the Mem\u2019ries   \u2026     the Magic! \u201d) and writing a memoir. Her perfectionist tendencies were in evidence on matters great and small during an interview at her Malibu estate. She said she was dismayed when she heard a fellow singer in conversation with an interviewer, and \u201cThey both called me Barbra \u201d not  . _____ 8. A Florida   called Moon Express won F. A. A. permission to try to land a spacecraft on the moon. Doing so would earn it $20 million Google Lunar X Prize, as the first such private effort. But the Moon Express chairman said the stakes were much higher. \u201cEverything we fight over  \u2014   whether it\u2019s land or it\u2019s fresh water, whether it is energy  \u2014   is in abundance in space,\u201d he said. _____ 9. The value of the digital currency Bitcoin plunged after one of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchanges said it had been hacked. An official with the exchange, Bitfinex in Hong Kong, said that 119, 756 Bitcoins  \u2014   worth tens of millions of dollars  \u2014   had been stolen. _____ 10. Brazil is welcoming a flood of athletes and spectators to the Rio Games amid a   epidemic of the Zika virus. This is the best mosquito repellent in the country. But it\u2019s not the best money can buy  \u2014   because it\u2019s not on the shelves. A military lab makes it for the exclusive use of the Brazilian Army. There is no \u201cplan for external commercialization,\u201d a military statement said. _____ 11. Finally, Happy 90th birthday, Tony Bennett. Thousands of Starbucks outlets played his albums, stars like Willie Nelson and Oprah Winfrey saluted him, and Lady Gaga ceremonially lights the Empire State Building in his honor at 8:30 p. m. Eastern. \u201cIt feels great to be 90!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThanks for all the birthday wishes. I\u2019m just getting started. \u201d _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
