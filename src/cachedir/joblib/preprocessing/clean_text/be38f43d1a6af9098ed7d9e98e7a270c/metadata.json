Dr. Scholtz said Mr. Pistorius showed symptoms of depression, anxiety and   stress disorder. He also said Mr. Pistorius was taking psychiatric medication and had problems with   memory. Gerrie Nel, the chief prosecutor, rejected that argument, saying that Mr. Pistorius had not expressed remorse for the death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Mr. Nel also questioned Dr. Scholtz\u2019s assertion that Mr. Pistorius was unable to testify, given that Mr. Pistorius recently gave an interview, his first about the killing, to the television network ITV. The interview is scheduled to be broadcast on June 24, which is probably after his sentencing. Guidelines call for a sentence of at least 15 years, but the judge has discretion to render a lighter or tougher sentence. The decision, which is not expected until later this week, will bring to a close a case that has riveted and divided South Africa. Mr. Pistorius, 29, was found guilty in December of murdering Ms. Steenkamp after South Africa\u2019s top appeals court overturned a lower court\u2019s conviction on the lesser charge of manslaughter. The court found that the earlier conviction had been based on a misinterpretation of laws and an erroneous dismissal of circumstantial evidence. The appeals court said Mr. Pistorius, who insists that he accidentally killed Ms. Steenkamp under the mistaken belief that an intruder had broken into his home, should have foreseen that his actions would kill someone. He fired four shots through a locked bathroom door, killing Ms. Steenkamp, who was on the other side. In a country with a high crime rate, the fear of home intrusion cuts across social and racial lines, and high walls and security guards are common in gated communities like the one where Mr. Pistorius lived in Pretoria. Mr. Pistorius\u2019s arrest in the killing of Ms. Steenkamp on Feb. 14, 2013, sent South Africans reeling. Known as the Blade Runner for the flexible   prosthetic legs he used when competing, Mr. Pistorius achieved worldwide fame by challenging   athletes, most notably at the 2012 London Games. He won medals at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Summer Paralympics. Ms. Steenkamp, who was 29 at the time of her death, was a model, a law school graduate and a budding   star. In September 2014  \u2014   after a lengthy and highly publicized trial that was likened to the   trial of O. J. Simpson in the United States  \u2014   Judge Masipa convicted Mr. Pistorius of culpable homicide but found him not guilty of murder. She found that prosecutors had failed to present \u201cstrong circumstantial evidence\u201d and to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Pistorius had shown intent to kill. Prosecutors, and Ms. Steenkamp\u2019s family, argued that Mr. Pistorius had deliberately killed his girlfriend after an argument. Although Mr. Pistorius was regarded as a hero to many in South Africa, the trial revealed another, darker side: a man with a mercurial temper, given to jealousy and occasional anger an aggressive driver an irresponsible gun owner and a celebrity who was used to getting his way. In their appeal, prosecutors argued that Judge Masipa had misinterpreted a crucial legal concept in finding Mr. Pistorius not guilty of murder. They argued that, under a legal principle known as dolus eventualis, Mr. Pistorius should be found guilty because he should have known that firing through the locked door would kill the person inside. The Supreme Court of Appeal, in Bloemfontein, agreed. Mr. Pistorius was released from prison in October after serving one year of the   sentence for manslaughter, and he has been living under house arrest. Dr. Scholtz called Mr. Pistorius\u2019s relationship with Ms. Steenkamp \u201ca normal, loving relationship,\u201d with \u201cno signs of abuse or coercion. \u201d Dr. Scholtz said that Mr. Pistorius \u201chas found some solace in the belief that the deceased is with God,\u201d and that he was enrolled in a degree program at the University of London. He argued that further incarceration \u201cwould not be psychologically or socially constructive\u201d and that Mr. Pistorius was not a threat to society. Mr. Pistorius, once a gun enthusiast, has sold his firearms, Dr. Scholtz said. \u201cHe is adamant that he never wants to touch or handle a firearm again,\u201d the psychiatrist said. But Mr. Nel, who   Dr. Scholtz, suggested that Mr. Pistorius had not expressed remorse. \u201cDoes he understand that he committed murder?\u201d Mr. Nel asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Dr. Scholtz said. \u201cIn what way?\u201d Mr. Nel asked. The prosecutor then made it clear that he was unconvinced.'"}, "time": 1742562211.0141075}
