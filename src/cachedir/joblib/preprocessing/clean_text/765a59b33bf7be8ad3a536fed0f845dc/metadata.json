Everyone, it seemed, ate at Haji Hussein: locals, soldiers, tourists and businessmen traveling the    highway that runs through the city. Starting in 2003, journalists covering the war ate there, and so did American soldiers and the insurgents who fought them, perhaps even at the same time. The restaurant was damaged by bombs multiple times, and entirely flattened once by an American airstrike. It was rebuilt, embraced as a symbol of Falluja\u2019s own rebirth after years of war, only to be abandoned when the city fell to the Islamic State more than two years ago. Now the   kebab restaurant has been reborn again, this time in Baghdad, in a modern,   building in the upscale Mansour neighborhood. A new entrant on the capital\u2019s thriving restaurant scene, it offers great kebab and a dose of nostalgia for a time when Baghdadis thought nothing of zipping off to Falluja for lunch at Haji Hussein. \u201cThis was the craft of my grandfather,\u201d said Mohammed Hussein, who runs the business that has been in his family since the 1930s, when Falluja was a city of agriculture, smuggling and tribal traditions, not a jihadist haven. The restaurant, shiny and well lit, is packed most nights, and patrons wait for tables  \u2014   15 to 20 minutes or so, something almost   in Iraq. There are two   televisions on the first floor, tuned to news channels reporting on the military campaign to retake Falluja from the Islamic State. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to watch the news,\u201d Mr. Hussein said. There was one news flash recently that did not escape his notice: The Iraqi Air Force, like the Americans 12 years ago, announced that it had struck his restaurant site in Falluja because leaders with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, were meeting there. A statement from Iraq\u2019s Joint Operation Command appeared on the television: \u201cBased on intelligence information about a meeting for ISIS leaders in Haji Hussein restaurant inside the center of Falluja an airstrike was launched on the restaurant, which led to the killing of tens of ISIS terrorists. \u201d But the restaurant, Mr. Hussein said, has been deserted for two and a half years. When Iraqi forces recently made gains inside Falluja, people almost immediately began talking about Haji Hussein. The federal police released a combat video saying they were fighting near the restaurant, and a glimpse of the   facade showed it damaged but not destroyed. On state television, commentators expressed hope that Haji Hussein might reopen soon in Falluja. In 2004, the Americans bombed the restaurant based on intelligence that insurgents loyal to Abu Musab   the founder of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner of the Islamic State, were eating there. After the bombing, a member of Mr. Hussein\u2019s family defiantly told The Boston Globe that \u201cthe mujahedeen and the insurgents prefer my restaurant and come to me for their three meals. \u201d Patrick Graham, a Canadian journalist who covered the Iraq war, likened Haji Hussein to a Nova Scotia branch of a popular Canadian doughnut chain. \u201cIt probably had been an insurgent meeting place,\u201d he wrote in an online column last year, \u201cbut only in the way that the local Tim Horton\u2019s in Antigonish, N. S. is a Conservative Party meeting place. Everyone went to Haji Hussein, insurgents included. \u201d This being the holy month of Ramadan, the Baghdad restaurant has been busy lately serving iftar, the evening meal to break the day\u2019s fast. The parking lot is also a beehive of activity: a security guard checking cars for bombs a man selling balloons to families children begging. As Mr. Hussein, 49, sat down to chat one recent evening, he was surrounded by   waiters  \u2014   much of the staff from Falluja now works in the new place  \u2014   filling the tables with dishes of mezze, or appetizers, as diners waited to break their fast. In addition to heaping platters of the famous kebab, there were dates coated with sesame paste, watermelon, hummus, cucumber and tomato salad, pickles and soup. There were some new items on the menu that were not served in Falluja: grilled river carp, called masgoof a Yemeni    meal called mandi and maklouba, a dish of chicken and eggplant and rice that is originally Palestinian. As customers streamed in, Mr. Hussein tried to recall how many times his restaurant in Falluja had been damaged or destroyed by the war. \u201cToo many to count,\u201d he said. At times, he said, he would have to call a local windowpane salesman once or twice a week. \u201cIt was a funny joke,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d call and he\u2019d say, \u2018Which size?\u2019 He would have all the sizes for my windows on hand, ready. \u201d Mr. Hussein recalled an American officer who used to stop by, and grab his kebab right off the grill with a piece of flatbread. But he kept his distance from the occupiers. \u201cWe tried not to become friends with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would say hi, we would say hi, that was it. \u201d He said peace would not be easy in Falluja, even after liberation from the Islamic State, without political compromises between the   government in Baghdad and the Sunni community. Speaking of the people of Falluja, he said, \u201cThere were reasons they joined ISIS  \u2014   oppression, random arrests. \u201d At least in his restaurant, Iraq does not seem hopelessly divided by sect. Sunnis and Shiites break their fast at slightly different times, and as sundown approached one of the televisions was tuned to a Sunni channel, the other to Iraqiya, the channel of the   government. When the call to prayer  \u2014   the signal that the day\u2019s fast was over  \u2014   went out on one, the Sunnis began eating. Fifteen minutes or so later, the Shiite customers began eating. Anas   who is perhaps Baghdad\u2019s only restaurant critic, has praised Haji Hussein on his widely followed Baghdad Restaurant Guide on Facebook, for its kebab, cleanliness and service. One Iraqi exile, pining for home, posted a comment on Mr. Sarraf\u2019s site: \u201cI have been out of Iraq for 13 years, and there is no Iraqi food or Iraqi kebab like Haji Hussein. Inshallah, I will come back one day to eat at Haji Hussein in Falluja and in Baghdad. \u201d In the kitchen, Mr. Hussein\u2019s nephew, Marwan Mohammed, was working the grill. Now 26, he has been working in the family business since he was 8, washing the skewers. Mr. Mohammed said the secret to his kebab is fresh lamb, as opposed to   imported meats that he said many Iraqi restaurants use. The family still raises its own sheep in a   area near Falluja, and usually serves the kebab on the same day the sheep is slaughtered, or the next day. \u201cWe only feed them grass and special food,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never let them go out in the open and eat garbage. \u201d The only other ingredient mixed with the minced lamb is onions. Sumac and a squeeze of lemon at the table add more flavor. Mr. Hussein\u2019s fortune may now be in Baghdad, but his heart is in Falluja. His hometown, he said, \u201cis like a sacred place for me. \u201d He added, \u201cMy heart beats faster when Falluja comes to my mind. \u201d He began to cry as he described what Falluja used to be. \u201cSimple people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tribal society. We\u2019ve never even had a hotel. There was hospitality for everyone. All homes were hotels for visitors. \u201d Recipes:   Kebabs | Adana Kebabs | Lamb and Fig Kebabs with Honey and Rosemary'"}, "time": 1742562949.170173}
