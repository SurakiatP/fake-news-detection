Whatever I pick up, all I read is: Mystery over Mistry\u2019s ouster; Che-Mistry no more, TATA group sacks chairman; Mist yet to clear on why Mistry was ousted, TATA says tata to Mistry. I can\u2019t take this anymore! Please stop. I can always find another job or even become a chairman of some other company if lady luck favors me, but will these Mistry puns ever end? I\u2019ve had enough of this pun-ishment!\u201d the ex-chairman cried out to The UnReal Times . The businessman was soon supported by Sixth Sense scientist Pranav Mistry, who tweeted, \u201cI feel you, bro!\u201d \\nThe mainstream media, however, shot back at Mistry, asking him to take a chill pill. \u201cSigh-rus Mistry clearly not happy over some witty puns, eh? ;)\u201d tweeted Times Group chairman Vineet Jain. Jain\u2019s tweet was soon followed by rival newspaper The Hindu publisher, N Ram\u2019s tweet: \u201cAbout time Cyrus gulps in some Citrus juice to calm himself. Ratan Tata\u2019s right about the intolerance part \u2013 it\u2019s coming from his own ex-chairman!\u201d \\nAn upset Mistry mentioned that sooner or later, he would have to change his name if things continue this way. \u201cThe last thing I want now is Cyrus Broacha meeting me and the media saying \u2018Cyrus broaches Mistry!\u2019 AAARGH!\u201d an angry Mistry cried. He was, however, consoled by actor Neil Nitin Mukesh. \u201cBe happy you have a popular 2-word name and not a 3-word one. That\u2019s much, much, much better! Seriously, seriously, seriously!\u201d Neil Nitin Mukesh reportedly told him. \\nMedia-appointed BJP MP, the VHP\u2019s Sadhvi Prachi, who usually asks people to go to Pakistan, got into a bit of a lighthearted mood herself. \u201cIf Cyrus doesn\u2019t like what happened, he can go to Cyprus!\u201d the Sadhvi exclaimed. The ex-chairman was also approached by Sports Minister Vijay Goel, who told him, \u201cI can never get a selfie with Miley Cyrus. So let me at least get one with Mistry Cyrus.\u201d \\nMistry\u2019s biggest consolation and shoulder to cry on, though, came all the way from South Africa, from the quarters of wicket keeper Quinton De Kock. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how it feels each time I trend on Twitter and see the tweets about me. Trust me, you\u2019re much better off. You just can\u2019t imagine how cocky some tweeters can get. Oops!\u201d the keeper is supposed to have said.
