Meanwhile, some   drama was happening offstage as this canceled ABC series sought a new home, bolstered by a Change. org petition signed by more than 174, 000 heartbroken fans. It found one, on CMT, where in a Season 5 preview at 9 p. m. on Thursday, Dec. 15, Rayna exhibits cracks in her gorgeous veneer. Her foundation shaken, \u201cshe is having some questions of her own mortality and her own artistry and her own sense of purpose in the world,\u201d said Connie Britton, who plays her. \u201cAnd that was exciting for me because I love questions of the soul where you are facing a transition in your own sense of who you are and what you\u2019re doing and what you have to offer in the world. \u201d (The season begins Jan. 5.) By phone from the set in Nashville, Ms. Britton, 49 and the mother of a    son, Eyob, pondered the show\u2019s direction. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Is it accurate that you\u2019ve signed on for only 10 of this season\u2019s 22 episodes? That is not accurate. Look, there was so much that got bounced around this summer as the show was canceled and then picked up again. I can just say that I\u2019m completely invested in this season and particularly in these new writers. [The showrunners] Marshall [Herskovitz] and Ed [Zwick] have been a wonderful breath of fresh air, and that\u2019s been really exciting. Did the move to CMT require a reboot? It was complete rebooting and, quite honestly, it was necessary. I did feel to some degree that the show had gone in a direction where we were losing a lot of what the subject matter can provide  \u2014   everything from story to replicating this really rich town of Nashville. When you get soapier and soapier, your characters suffer because they start to show up just to deliver plot, and you lose sight of who they are. So I think the show is going to move forward in a more languid way that I\u2019m hopeful will really bring these characters back to life. What\u2019s the best thing about playing Rayna? I love the challenge of constant   which to me feels very relevant as a woman and as a career woman and as a mother. But quite frankly, probably what I love most is the thing that scares and challenges me the most, which is the music. So even though every single time I have to sing I have some sort of crazy anxiety attack, it\u2019s still the most exciting part of the whole thing. It\u2019s been said that women like you because you lead with your brains, not your beauty. I feel very fortunate that I never got into this business as a beauty queen. Even back in high school, the actors I idolized were the chameleons. That really took the onus off of what I looked like, and what a beautiful woman is supposed to look like. I still feel really lucky, because gosh, as you get older, that stuff starts to go away, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. I do see friends of mine who are panicking  \u2014   and I\u2019m not panicking. Don\u2019t get me wrong: When I see wrinkles on my face, it doesn\u2019t make me happy. But at the same time, I\u2019m always coming from the inside in terms of my approach to the world. So there\u2019s power in owning your age. I\u2019m not interested in playing   . I\u2019m not interested in playing irrelevant. I want to depict characters who are getting better with age. That sounds like such a clich\u00e9, but all the women I know who are in their 40s are awesome and sexy and so smart and have life experience that you cannot duplicate. And this show is really a great opportunity to push back on the idea. When the show first came out, there was a lot of marketing going on  \u2014   \u201cRayna Jaymes, the fading country music star. \u201d And I have fought it every step of the way, because I\u2019m like, \u201cAbsolutely not. \u201d What I know is existing in a world that\u2019s changing around you and the complications that come along with that. But certainly not just the victim of a life gone by. No way. Is this your last season? I\u2019m not sure, honestly. We\u2019re all sort of figuring out what\u2019s happening, and right now we\u2019re just in it. And I\u2019m really happy to be in that place. How would you want Rayna to go out? Oh my gosh. [Pause.] In a blaze of country music glory!'"}, "time": 1742562127.7640014}
