This \u201cinvestigation\u201d is over and done with; for Comey to throw fuel on the fire of right-wing paranoia this close to the election cannot be seen as anything but a partisan effort to derail the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, especially after it became clear that Comey tried to suppress news of the investigation into Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s ties to the Russian Federation \u2013 a much more serious and potentially seditious allegation. \\nWatch the President speak here: \u2018We don\u2019t operate on innuendo\u2019 \u2014 President Obama discusses Hillary, emails, and the FBI in an exclusive interview with NowThis pic.twitter.com/0J6tJyEYSh'"}, "time": 1742562988.4755685}
