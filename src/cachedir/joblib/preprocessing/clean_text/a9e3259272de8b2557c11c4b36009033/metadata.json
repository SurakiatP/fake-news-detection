Trump have successfully delivered to the Republican establishment exactly what they said they wanted: a unified,   government. [Unfortunately, instead of recognizing victory and unifying to ensure the best conservative ideas are embraced, certain conservative leaders, particularly from the elitist D. C. segment, have decided to line up a good ol\u2019 circular firing squad.  Hours before President Trump took to the stage for his home run speech to the Joint Session of Congress, we heard cheap shots at him about budget rumors  \u2014   since no presidential budget has been submitted yet.  Republican Senators were asserting that any budget that included desperately needed cuts to the bloated State Department would be \u201cdead on arrival. \u201d They are joined by a group we can only term as Conservative Bubble Boys and Girls. They\u2019re a small, but vocal group of entrenched politicos who have clung to the conservative label as a way to stay relevant in the D. C. bubble. Regrettably, they spend far too much of their time finding fault with what other conservatives are doing.  They\u2019ve been out of touch for so long, it seems like they don\u2019t really know whose team they\u2019re on.  Following President Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday, I released the following statement: Since 2012, Tea Party Express has hosted the official Tea Party response to the President\u2019s address. Last night was the first night that our address wasn\u2019t necessary. Not because the ideas of limited government and economic growth have fallen out of vogue  \u2014   because they surely haven\u2019t  \u2014   but because that speech was delivered on the floor of the U. S. House of Representatives by the President of the United States. President Trump delivered an eloquent address, where he clearly and deliberately laid out his conservative vision for America. It should now be clear to everyone that the Tea Party movement is more than rallies and protests. We have arrived in D. C. through our elected representatives, to fulfill our mission and finally rein in government. But instead of covering this milestone for the conservative movement, the Bubble Boys and Girls used it to write the Tea Party\u2019s obituary, claiming that we were dead because we somehow embraced a big government agenda void of a conservative vision. Huh? The Weekly Standard published the piece \u201cRIP, Tea Party: \u201d and claimed, \u201cThe   movement embraces big government. \u201d  Why?  Because they claim the President did not outline specific budget cuts, but only talked about spending priorities.  Thus, they conclude \u2014  before a single piece of legislation is introduced \u2014  that he is a \u201cbig government conservative. \u201d Then, a senior editor at National Review asserted, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m crazy, but I\u2019d bet that if President Obama (or a President Jeb Bush) had made a similar speech with similar spending commitments and no explanation of how to pay for them, the Tea Party Express would have mustered enough objections to respond. \u201d  Yes, the National Review writer is right.  We had no confidence that Barack Obama was going to rein in the size and cost of government we would have proudly stood with Jeb Bush if he had a   cabinet.  We would have given a lot of room to a President who had appointed Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, or Scott Pruitt to the EPA or Tom Price to head up HHS. Furthermore, both authors oddly marginalized the President\u2019s   agenda, which includes historic tax cuts, massive regulatory reform, and bold education changes that will affect millions of children across the nation. And that doesn\u2019t even touch the Administration\u2019s unequivocal commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare. These are major conservative priorities \u2014  and priorities that have defined the Tea Party movement \u2014  but the Bubble Boys and Girls won\u2019t let facts get in the way of an opportunity to bash the President. Admittedly, there are plenty of details to work through as the Administration and Congress prepare to honor the promises they made to voters. And none of us are under any illusion that we\u2019ll be happy with 100 percent of every decision made. If the President or Congress deviates from the will of the voters, we should call them out \u2014  I know that Tea Party Express will. However, instead of impulsively attacking President Trump and fellow conservatives, let\u2019s try to keep our powder dry and wait for there to be a fight. Maybe that way we will be ready and united to actually win some of the impending battles and deliver the best solutions for conservatives.  Taylor Budowich is the executive director of Tea Party Express, the nation\u2019s largest Tea Party political action committee.'"}, "time": 1742563742.501245}
