[Student William David Meredith has been threatened with disciplinary action by administrators over his refusal to remove a Donald Trump campaign sign from the window of his dorm room.  \u201cI am asking that you remove the sign within 24 hours. I have included your RA, Tiffany, on this email so that she can check to ensure it is gone within 24 hours,\u201d Community Director Dylan Lloyd wrote in an email, to which Meredith replied by simply stating: \u201c1st Amendment. \u201d Although Lloyd acknowledged that Meredith does have first amendment protections on the public university\u2019s campus, he countered by arguing that federal buildings cannot display endorsements of political candidates. \u201cThe policy you\u2019ve quoted pertains to political candidates, which President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are not,\u201d Meredith argued. \u201cNothing on it says anything about campaigning and his campaign is over, which makes it memorabilia not campaign material. \u201d \u201cWhile I understand that, it still shows that the university supports a particular candidate,\u201d Lloyd fired back in response. \u201cWhile we are not actively in campaign season, Trump will run for reelection in four years. The sign makes it look like the university supports Trump as a candidate. \u201d Meredith held firmly that no reasonable person would consider a sign in a student\u2019s window to be an institutional endorsement of a political candidate. \u201cNo reasonable person would see a sign in a dorm room window and presume that the university is endorsing that message,\u201d Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Travis Barham said in a statement. \u201cThe Supreme Court has long recognized that a university does not endorse everything on campus that it fails to censor,\u201d he explained, noting that \u201cin 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that even elementary school students could understand this, saying \u2018[t]he proposition that schools do not endorse everything they fail to censor is not complicated\u2019 [Bd. of Educ. of Westside Cmty. Sch. v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 250 (1990)]. \u201d Despite this, administrators maintained that Meredith would be disciplined by the university if he refused to remove the sign from his window. \u201cIf you are found responsible for violating policies, administrative sanctions will most likely be determined at the conclusion of the hearing, even if you do not attend,\u201d an email from an administrator stated, asserting that Meredith \u201cwill be required to comply with all sanctions administrated [sic] as a result of the findings. \u201d Ultimately, the school\u2019s Executive Director of Marketing and Communications Michael Haskins confirmed that Meredith would be able to keep his sign up in his window, citing a misunderstanding on the university policy on behalf on the staff members who originally took issue with the sign.
