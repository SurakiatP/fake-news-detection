[Mike Florio writes at NBC Sports PFT that although Kaepernick may not, as Ron Jaworski once claimed, have the potential to \u201cbecome one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time,\u201d he deserves a chance \u201cto show what he can still do. \u201d  Florio agrees with Doug Lesmerises of the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the Cleveland Browns should give the QB, who refused to stand for the National Anthem last season, a chance. The blame lies with Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, Florio argues, because he is a Republican with ties to the Jeb Bush for president campaign and he is the brother of Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, without considering that management might be considering their fan base or that Kaepernick just isn\u2019t that good.  Florio doesn\u2019t seem to remember the Isaiah Crowell ordeal.  The Cleveland Browns running back posted an Instagram pic last year of a cop getting murdered by a terrorist and appeared to \u201cadvocate the knifing of police officers,\u201d which caused the Cleveland Police Union president to actually threaten to pull security from Browns games. Crowell eventually apologized. Kaepernick might be an especially bad fit in a town already weary of his   stance. Moreover, Florio criticizes New York Jets Owner Woody Johnson for having the same \u201cmindset\u201d as Haslam. Johnson, appointed by President Trump as Ambassador to the United Kingdom, would never employ Kaepernick. That\u2019s because, despite their current search for a quarterback, his new boss already voiced disdain for Kaepernick\u2019s lack of respect for the American Flag and the nation\u2019s police officers. Trump said of Kaepernick\u2019s antics, \u201cMaybe he should find a country that works better for him. \u201d Florio seems incredulous, saying, \u201cThe fact that no one has even brought him in for a visit suggests that something more than football is influencing the process. \u201d Why is it that Florio only points the finger at conservative owners for denying Kaepernick a place on the roster?  Why not go after Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, who contributed handsomely to the Hillary Clinton campaign? Yet, instead of signing Kaepernick, Lurie   the white Nick Foles. Why isn\u2019t he under scrutiny? The Rooneys own the Steelers, and one of them served as Obama\u2019s ambassador to Ireland. With Ben Roethlisberger musing about retirement, why haven\u2019t they brought Kaepernick in yet, if only for a look? As Hamlet\u2019s Marcellus might have said, \u201cSomething is rotten in the land of sports media. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563381.3500593}
