They will be blasting protest playlists while carrying posters and flags, from the familiar rainbow to the worn colors of Haiti. But they are not going to the better known Women\u2019s March on Washington, planned for Jan. 21, the day after Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Instead, they are headed to the nation\u2019s capital on Saturday for a more modest rally focused on the rights of immigrants, called We Are Here to Stay and scheduled to start at 11 a. m. at the Metropolitan A. M. E. Church. For these groups, there was a practical, if not urgent, reason to hold the rally on Jan. 14: Barack Obama will still be president. \u201cAs an organizer, the 14th is a date that I feel safe mobilizing people to Washington,\u201d said Natalia Aristizabal, of Make the Road New York, one of the rally\u2019s sponsors. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen after the inauguration. \u201d National and local organizers said they were concerned about the possibility of undocumented protesters being arrested during the new administration, especially since Mr. Trump said he planned to deport the two million to three million undocumented immigrants that he said had criminal convictions. Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, the executive director of United We Dream, the national organization promoting the interests of undocumented youth known as dreamers, called the threat to immigrant communities \u201cimminent\u201d and added: \u201cTo be quite frank, we fear the worst. \u201d That is not to say that immigrants will be avoiding the women\u2019s march. Some organizations, like United We Dream and the New York Immigration Coalition, are partners in both, and there is other overlap. New York\u2019s   Association, which is led by Linda Sarsour, is also a sponsor of the Women\u2019s March, of which Ms. Sarsour is one of the main organizers. Part of the mission statement of the Women\u2019s March calls on \u201cimmigrants of all statuses\u201d to attend, but that event has a broader platform that includes issues of pay equity, reproductive rights and safety from domestic violence. Organizers of the immigrant rally said that their protest aims to highlight the disparate groups who make up their movement, and who represent the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s of the immigrant community, of people of color, it\u2019s broader than people who are first generation,\u201d said Muzna Ansari, 28, the immigrant policy manager for the New York Immigration Coalition. A child of Indian immigrants, she is Muslim. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment of connection, too. There are black immigrants who we don\u2019t talk about. \u201d Ninaj Raoul, a founder and executive director of Haitian Women for Haitian Refugees, said she had seen the immigration rights movement focus on the   Latino community since the 2012 election. But black immigrants, who are far less likely to be undocumented, have pressing issues of their own, she said. \u201cNow more than ever it\u2019s important for the Haitian voice to be heard in this movement,\u201d Ms. Raoul said. \u201cNot just for the incoming government, where we have so many reasons to be worried, but for the current government because of the actions they\u2019ve taken on Haitian immigrants. \u201d Over the last several months more than 80 Haitian immigrants have walked into her Brooklyn office seeking help, she said, anguished by the shifting American policy that has left them separated from family members. And those living in the city because of temporary protection granted after their country\u2019s 2010 earthquake do not know how long that will last. Migrants from Haiti have flooded the southern border of Mexico since last spring, many making dangerous journeys through nine countries after fleeing South America. In September, the Obama administration detained Haitians at the U. S.  border arriving without visas and ordered deportations. Some pregnant women and mothers with children were given a temporary humanitarian reprieve to stay, but their husbands were deported. After Hurricane Matthew struck in early October, the administration delayed deporting Haitians, but then resumed deportations in November. For Haitians who have been living in the United States with temporary protection granted after the earthquake, that status that is set to expire in July. Ms. Raoul said that because Hurricane Matthew damaged food supplies, those Haitians did not know if they could return. So Haitian immigrants are going to Washington to appeal to Mr. Obama while they still can. They want him to take executive action to grant Haitian migrants at the southern border permission to temporarily enter the United States on humanitarian grounds, and to extend the temporary protections for another 18 months. Ms. Raoul plans to bring 10 Haitian immigrants, and their country\u2019s flag, to Washington. They will take the bus from Sunset Park with 55 young people representing Atlas: D. I. Y. which serves undocumented immigrant youth in the neighborhood. Michelina Ferrara, the deputy director of Atlas, plans to blast her \u201crevolutionary playlist,\u201d with RB and   artists, both on the bus speakers and from her fanny pack. For those not traveling to Washington on Jan. 14, immigrant actions are also planned in 50 other cities. The New York Immigrant Coalition will be kicking off a statewide campaign called This is Our New York with events in Union Square Hempstead, on Long Island and the Hudson Valley. By then, Kathia Gutierrez, 48, will be in Washington with her daughter, Kathya, 29. They arrived 16 years ago from Bolivia. Kathya works as a nanny, saving money for college she can work legally because of President Obama\u2019s program giving certain rights to undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children by their parents. Kathia, her mother, is an activist for Make the Road New York and is going to Washington to deliver a message for   Trump: \u201cLook out for the youth. \u201d They will be joined by others fighting for their own subset of immigrant rights, including Alexis Pampill\u00f3n, 44, an Argentine immigrant who identifies as gender nonconforming he and 20 others members of Make the Road\u2019s L. G. B. T. Q. rights group will be leaving from Queens. Make the Road\u2019s members, drawn from places including Bridgeport, Conn. Elizabeth, N. J. and Pennsylvania, will fill eight buses. Not all will fit into the church in Washington, which has a capacity of about 2, 500. More than 3, 000 protesters are expected, organizers said. Some, said Ms. Aristizabal of Make the Road, will stand outside with signs in Spanish and English: \u201cAqu\u00ed Estamos y no Nos Vamos,\u201d and \u201cWe are Here to Stay. \u201d That slogan is familiar, she said, adding, \u201cBut it has never been so much of a declaration of defiance. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564327.8760257}
