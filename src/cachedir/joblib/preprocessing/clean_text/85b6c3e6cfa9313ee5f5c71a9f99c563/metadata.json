[\u201cWith what might be regarded as unseemly haste, Disney is negotiating with the actor\u2019s estate over her continued appearance in the franchise,\u201d Scottish journalist Kirsty Wark said in a recent appearance on the BBC show Newsnight.  \u201cIf Disney gets the   Carrie Fisher will join Peter Cushing, who, last month, 15 years after his death, played a key role in Rogue One as Grand Moff Tarkin,\u201d Wark said. Fisher passed away on December 27, four days after suffering a heart attack while onboard a flight from London to Los Angeles. The latest Star Wars film, Rogue One, featured a digitally enhanced Princess Leia  \u2014   a   Carrie Fisher meant to mirror her character in the original Star Wars. Rogue One filmmakers also used digital scans to reprise Peter Cushing\u2019s character, the villainous Grand Moff Tarkin. Cushing died in 1994.   imagery (CGI) has been used to bring back deceased characters  \u2014   for better or for worse  \u2014   for decades, though the practice has caused controversy. In 2013,   martial artist and film legend Bruce Lee was digitally reincarnated and placed in a   television commercial for Johnnie Walker Blue Label. And while Lee\u2019s daughter Shannon was consulted on the project, the ad left some fans furious, because Bruce Lee famously did not consume alcohol: \u201cThey\u2019re bad for my body\u201d he was once quoted as saying. Lee\u2019s   likeness was also used to sell Mars bars. After the untimely death of Fast and Furious franchise star Paul Walker in 2013, CGI and the late actor\u2019s brothers were used to shoot the final scenes of Furious 7. Oddly enough, Fisher once joked during a roast of George Lucas at the AFI Life Achievement Awards that she doesn\u2019t even own the rights to her own image. \u201cAnd though amongst your many possessions, you have owned my likeness all these years so that every time I looked in the mirror I have to send you a check for a couple of bucks. \u201d Nevertheless, Fisher reportedly completed all of her scenes for the upcoming Star Wars: Episode VIII before her death. Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy recently said it is hard to imagine a world without Fisher. Indeed, the beloved actress is gone, but perhaps Princess Leia will yet live on.
