His research, he added, \u201cshows a civilization that had been strong, that had ceased to be so and that\u2019s heading toward its end. \u201d Mr. Onfray is one of the latest popular authors to join France\u2019s booming decline industry, a spate of books and articles (with a handful of TV shows) that explore the country\u2019s (and the West\u2019s) failings and France\u2019s obsession with those failings. (Last year, the word \u201cd\u00e9clinisme,\u201d or \u201cdeclinism,\u201d entered France\u2019s Larousse dictionary.) It\u2019s a phenomenon that cuts across the political spectrum and has picked up velocity in recent years by tapping into an anxious national mood. And its loudest voices are intellectuals with platforms in the national news media. Beyond Mr. Onfray\u2019s, other books with decline on their minds have appeared in the past few weeks. \u201cThe Returned,\u201d a best seller by the journalist David Thomson, is an investigative report about French jihadists who\u2019ve returned home from Syria. \u201cA Submissive France: Voices of Defiance\u201d compiles interviews on France\u2019s troubled banlieues, or suburbs, overseen by the historian Georges Bensoussan. \u201cChronicles of French Denial,\u201d by the   economist and historian Nicolas Baverez, is about how France continued its economic decline under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. There\u2019s also \u201cAn Imaginary Racism\u201d by the   philosopher Pascal Bruckner, who was recently cleared of charges of inciting hate speech and argues that fear of being labeled Islamophobic is leading people to   their speech, while in November, the Sciences Po professor Gilles Kepel published \u201cThe Fracture,\u201d which explores how the radicalization of some young Muslims is tearing apart French society. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s very striking now is how pervasive those ideas are,\u201d said Sudhir Hazareesingh, a professor at Oxford University and the author of \u201cHow the French Think. \u201d \u201cOne of the things characteristic of the present moment is this idea that decline and decadence are not just the preserve of the extreme right. \u201d France\u2019s preoccupation with decline has been dated by some scholars to the   of the early 19th century, and to the late 1970s and the end of three decades of postwar economic growth by others. Today, different \u201cdeclinist\u201d strains have merged, from Catholic reactionaries to nonreligious thinkers preoccupied by questions of national identity and political corruption. With France\u2019s presidential elections looming in April, these often abstract ideas are taking more concrete form as the   National Front and the   Republican Party capitalize on sentiments of decline exacerbated by economic malaise and terrorist attacks. Mr. Onfray\u2019s \u201cDecadence\u201d begins with early Christian history, traverses the French Revolution, then sweeps in the Holocaust, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which Mr. Onfray says prefigured the 2015 attacks at the French satirical journal Charlie Hebdo. Though he looks beyond France in his diagnosis, his homeland is central for much of its nearly 600 pages. Mr. Baverez, a lawyer and economist whose \u201cChronicles of French Decline\u201d came out this week and whose \u201cFrance in Free Fall\u201d was a hit in 2003, said he didn\u2019t believe in the idea of declinism. \u201cIt\u2019s a false concept because it gives the impression that decline is something fated,\u201d said Mr. Baverez, who has consulted with Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the   presidential candidate now caught up in a worsening corruption scandal. \u201cWe have to diagnose denial we have to accept reality to find solutions. \u201d Even in a country like France, where pleasure is held sacred, decline does seem to be better business than optimism. \u201cTo put it in Manichaean terms: Anything positive doesn\u2019t sell, and anything negative sells, as if there were a sort of masochism on the part of some readers,\u201d said the historian Robert Frank, the author of the 2014 book \u201cThe Fear of Decline: France from 1914 to 2014. \u201d \u201cThe French Suicide,\u201d by the conservative journalist \u00c9ric Zemmour, has sold 510, 000 copies since it appeared in 2014 it argues that immigration and feminism have contributed to French decline. The philosopher Alain Finkielkraut\u2019s \u201cThe Unhappy Identity,\u201d about French multiculturalism and its discontents, started a national conversation in 2013, while \u201cThe Time Has Come to Tell What I Have Seen,\u201d a 2015 political memoir by the politician and writer Philippe de Villiers that\u2019s heavy on concern about decay, has been a best seller. The   magazine Valeurs Actuelles, which publishes frequent warnings about the decline of France and the threat of Islamic terrorism, saw its combined print and digital circulation rise to 119, 000 copies last year from 86, 000 in 2011, according to figures provided by the magazine. The decline boom seems to manifest itself in books and intellectual debate more than in popular culture, although some French television shows have waded into the murky waters. Recent seasons of \u201cEngrenages,\u201d or \u201cSpiral,\u201d a dark police drama, paint a bleak picture. Not everyone is so pessimistic. \u201cYes, the French speak about \u2018d\u00e9clinisme\u2019 and are fascinated by decadence, but the most popular political figure in France today is the only one that speaks of hope,\u201d said the political scientist Dominique Mo\u00efsi, author of \u201cThe Geopolitics of Emotion: How Cultures of Fear, Humiliation, and Hope Are Reshaping the World. \u201d He was referring to Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister in the current Socialist government who founded his own insurgent party and has been gaining momentum. Even if declinism is going strong, France\u2019s birthrate is still among the highest in Europe, and studies have consistently shown the French to be more pessimistic about their country than about their own lives. Some hope the decline industry has peaked. \u201cI think Trump and Brexit were a kind of electric shock, and something changed,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Daumas, the editor of the Ideas section of the French   daily Lib\u00e9ration. She pointed to \u201cA World History of France,\u201d by the medieval historian Patrick Boucheron, which seeks to put French history in a broader context and argues that the country has absorbed immigrants for centuries. The challenge is that \u201cthe partisans of decline have formed a vocabulary, a way of speaking that\u2019s accessible to the broader public,\u201d Ms. Daumas said. \u201cThe progressive intellectuals of the left lost their public and are trying to get it back,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a real battle. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628534.1293993}
