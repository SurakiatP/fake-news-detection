It was spring 2008, and Mr. Green, a    who had shot and killed a grocery owner, was on Virginia\u2019s death row. His woes, his lawyers said, dated to childhood he was born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, repeated three years of elementary school and never learned to tie his shoes. His was precisely the kind of execution a young Tim Kaine, a   lawyer with a deeply felt revulsion for capital punishment, would have worked himself to the bone to stop. \u201cMurder is wrong in the gulag, in Afghanistan, in Soweto, in the mountains of Guatemala, in Fairfax County,\u201d he once declared, as one of his clients was about to be put to death. \u201cAnd even the Spring Street Penitentiary. \u201d But on the night of May 27, Mr. Green was led into the execution chamber at the Greensville Correctional Center, strapped to a gurney and hooked up to intravenous lines. Shortly after 10 p. m. he became the fifth person put to death while Mr. Kaine was the governor of Virginia. For Mr. Kaine, now a senator and Hillary Clinton\u2019s newly named running mate, no issue has been as fraught politically or personally as the death penalty. His handling of capital punishment reveals a central truth about Mr. Kaine: He is both a man of conviction and very much a politician, a man of unshakable faith who nonetheless recognizes  \u2014   and expediently bends to, his critics suggest  \u2014   the reality of the Democratic Party and the state he represents. He opposes both abortion and the death penalty, he has said, because \u201cmy faith teaches life is sacred. \u201d Yet he strongly supports a woman\u2019s right to choose and has a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood. And Mr. Kaine presided over 11 executions as governor, delaying some but granting clemency only once. He cast his decisions in simple terms: As Virginia\u2019s governor, he was sworn to uphold the law  \u2014   a message that helped him get elected governor. Calm, never letting his passion overtake reason and open to compromise, Mr. Kaine, 58, is well liked even by many Republicans he has worked with. His centrist appeal is one reason Mrs. Clinton added him to her ticket. But some death penalty opponents cast his decisions as political survival and ambition. \u201cTim is a politician,\u201d said Jack   who served as the executive director of Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty when Mr. Kaine was the governor. \u201cEven though they say they\u2019re not running for the next office, there\u2019s always something coming up. \u201d Deep inside, Mr. Kaine\u2019s allies say, his role in seeing prisoners put to death tore at him. On days when an execution was scheduled, said Wayne Turnage, his former chief of staff, the normally outgoing governor would be \u201cless communicative, and quietly pensive,\u201d and when the moment was near, he would retreat to his corner office and remain there alone. When it was over, an aide would enter quietly, to report the dead man\u2019s last words. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I saw him praying,\u201d Mr. Kaine\u2019s former chief legal counsel, Larry Roberts, recalled. \u201cI\u2019m sure that he was. \u201d Wherever Mr. Kaine could hold to his ideals, his supporters say, he did. Though he commuted only one sentence, to life in prison, Mr. Roberts said the governor\u2019s team concluded the inmate was mentally unfit for execution, using an expansive interpretation of Supreme Court case law that Mr. Kaine\u2019s predecessors might not have employed. When the Supreme Court took up the constitutionality of lethal injection in 2008, Mr. Kaine suspended executions until the court ruled to allow the procedure. And when Republicans in the General Assembly tried to expand use of the death penalty to cover more crimes, the governor blocked them. \u201cIf there was any death penalty bill that came up, it would go into the incinerator, I will tell you that,\u201d Mr. Turnage said. \u201cThere was no sentiment for expanding the death penalty. That wasn\u2019t going to happen. \u201d Mr. Kaine declined to be interviewed. But in a 2009 interview with The   toward the end of his term, he said each clemency decision had been \u201cvery painful,\u201d though his experience as a lawyer had prepared him. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten the last meal, and I\u2019ve held the guy\u2019s hand, and I\u2019ve been to the Supreme Court, and I\u2019ve been to the protests, and I know this very, very well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because of that, it was kind of demystified. \u201d Mr. Kaine was a new associate at a Richmond law firm, specializing in civil litigation but eager to carve out a portfolio in civil rights, in the   when he took the first of two pro bono capital punishment cases he would handle. His client was Richard Lee Whitley, convicted of murder for strangling and slitting the throat of an elderly female neighbor, and then sexually assaulting her corpse, after an alcohol and drug binge. It was \u201cnot a sympathetic case,\u201d but Mr. Kaine, driven by his faith, \u201cwas extremely passionate about it,\u201d said his   Tom Wolf, later Mr. Kaine\u2019s law partner and close friend. \u201cHe said there were a lot of people on death row who hadn\u2019t had a fair trial, and there were not nearly enough lawyers willing to take those cases. \u201d Virginia\u2019s Supreme Court declined to block the execution, so Mr. Kaine turned to the federal courts. He argued that Mr. Whitley had not received a fair trial, because his   lawyer had failed to investigate or introduce evidence of the psychological damage Mr. Whitley had suffered as a child. The judges, Mr. Wolf said, \u201cdidn\u2019t buy it. \u201d Neither did the Supreme Court, which rejected Mr. Kaine\u2019s request for a stay after Virginia\u2019s governor, Gerald L. Baliles, refused a petition for clemency. On July 6, 1987, Mr. Whitley was executed in the electric chair. Mr. Kaine did not witness it  \u2014   Mr. Whitley did not want him to, a Kaine aide said  \u2014   but was intent on being with him in the hours before his death. Along with a priest, they shared Mass and the condemned man\u2019s last meal. \u201cI\u2019m certain that Tim felt very close to him,\u201d Mr. Wolf said. \u201cIt was important to him to let Richard know that he was there for him, no matter what, and that he wasn\u2019t just filing papers for him, but that he regarded Richard as a valuable human being. \u201d In 2005, when he was the lieutenant governor and running for governor against Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general, he was fighting the perception that he was too liberal to lead the state. Issue No. 1 was the death penalty Virginia was second only to Texas in executions since 1976. \u201cPeople thought it was almost disqualifying to be against the death penalty in Virginia,\u201d said Bob Holsworth, a longtime political analyst in the state. Candidates who held the stance were routinely dismissed, he said, as being \u201csoft on crime. \u201d So Mr. Kaine\u2019s team prepared, developing a message that cast the issue in terms of his faith, pointing out his work as a Jesuit missionary in Honduras. Then, in October, Mr. Kilgore ran an advertisement featuring the father of a murder victim whose killer had been represented by Mr. Kaine. \u201cTim Kaine says that Adolf Hitler doesn\u2019t qualify for the death penalty,\u201d the grieving father said. The Hitler reference drew condemnation, and the Kaine team responded with its own ad, featuring a serious Mr. Kaine staring straight into the camera and telling voters that he wanted to \u201cset the record straight,\u201d and explaining that despite his religious objections, \u201cas governor I\u2019ll carry out death sentences handed down by Virginia juries because that\u2019s the law. \u201d The ads and   messaging proved a turning point, said David Eichenbaum, Mr. Kaine\u2019s media strategist. \u201cOnce many of these voters learned he was a man of deep faith and actually was a missionary,\u201d Mr. Eichenbaum said, \u201call of a sudden he wasn\u2019t so liberal anymore. \u201d The first big test of Mr. Kaine\u2019s promise came in April 2006, three months after he took office. Dexter Lee Vinson, 43, was set to be executed for abducting and killing his former girlfriend, whose mutilated body was found in a vacant house. A Vatican representative and Roman Catholic bishops in Arlington, Va. and Richmond asked Mr. Kaine to spare him. One of Mr. Vinson\u2019s sisters, Jewel Bailey, expressed hope that Mr. Kaine\u2019s religious convictions would win out. \u201cMy thing is, \u2018Why did you take the position that you have when you don\u2019t believe yourself in the death penalty? \u2019\u201d she said at the time. \u201cThe Bible says, \u2018Thou shall not kill,\u2019 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to stand by. Thou shall not kill. \u201d Inside the governor\u2019s office, Mr. Kaine and his lawyers were following a careful protocol devised by an aide to a previous Democratic governor of Virginia, L. Douglas Wilder. The governor would have no direct contact with family members or inmates\u2019 lawyers. Instead, the governor\u2019s staff lawyers would prepare for him a detailed memo with competing arguments  \u2014   the most aggressive case for clemency and the most aggressive case for execution. Mr. Kaine would pepper the lawyers with questions, including whether an inmate might be innocent, or mentally incompetent to face execution, or whether there had been gross procedural irregularities. But he almost always deferred to the findings of courts in the one case in which he granted clemency, he concluded that the inmate\u2019s mental status had changed since he had been convicted, said Mr. Roberts, his former chief counsel. Mr. Kaine took comfort, Mr. Roberts said, in the fact that as the governor, he did not have to actually sign death warrants. It was simply up to him to decide whether to intervene. \u201cI think he viewed himself as the final decision maker, with a caveat,\u201d Mr. Roberts said, \u201cthat it was death unless we stepped in, so he was never deciding whether to impose the penalty. \u201d Mr. Vinson\u2019s was the first execution of Mr. Kaine\u2019s term as governor. Ten more would be put to death, including one of the \u201cD. C. snipers,\u201d John Allen Muhammad, and Mr. Green, whose clemency petition to Mr. Kaine said he was a \u201cmentally retarded man by every reliable scientific measure. \u201d \u201cThis was a case that he could have intervened on, and it wouldn\u2019t have taken much to say, \u2018I\u2019m concerned enough to not let the execution go forward,\u2019\u201d said Robert Lee, who worked on Mr. Green\u2019s clemency petition, which asked Mr. Kaine to \u201cerr on the side of mercy and life. \u201d In a statement on his decision, Mr. Kaine said Mr. Green\u2019s sentence had been upheld by several courts, and that the Supreme Court had declined to hear it. \u201cHaving carefully reviewed the Petition for Clemency and judicial opinions regarding this case, I find no compelling reason to set aside the sentence that was recommended by the jury, and then imposed and affirmed by the courts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccordingly, I decline to intervene. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628514.7706687}
