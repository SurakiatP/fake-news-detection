Next week\u2019s announcement of the Nobel Prize in Literature will be followed by the awarding of the Man Booker Prize later in October and the National Book Awards in November. Here\u2019s a guide to the finalists for the honors  \u2014   and the chatter about who might win the Nobel. Nobel Prize in Literature This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Literature will be announced on Oct. 13, a week later than usual. The voting process is a closely guarded secret, but that never stops readers from scrambling to figure out who might be next to receive the honor. (Last year\u2019s winner, Svetlana Alexievich, was one of the rare nonfiction writers to take home the medal.) Two familiar names sit atop this year\u2019s odds board, according to the   gambling site Ladbrokes: the Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami and the Syrian poet Adonis. They are followed by Philip Roth, who would be the first American to win the award since Toni Morrison in 1993, though he may not have helped his chances with this comment in a 2014 interview: \u201cI wonder if I had called \u2018Portnoy\u2019s Complaint\u2019 \u2018The Orgasm Under Rapacious Capitalism,\u2019 if I would thereby have earned the favor of the Swedish Academy. \u201d Other names on the list include Joyce Carol Oates, the Kenyan novelist Ngugi Wa Thiong\u2019o, the Albanian novelist Ismail Kadare and the Spanish novelist Javier Mar\u00edas. \u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6 Man Booker Prize The six Booker finalists were drawn from an earlier longlist, and the winner will be announced on Oct. 25. In 2014, the prize, which had previously been limited to writers from Britain, Ireland, the Commonwealth and Zimbabwe, changed its rules to include submissions from any author whose work was published in Britain and was first written in English. This year\u2019s six finalists:  \u201cThe Sellout\u201d by Paul Beatty Beatty\u2019s bold satire about race in America was one of the Book Review\u2019s 10 Best Books of 2015. In the Book Review, Kevin Young wrote about the novel in the context of the history of black satire. He said Beatty takes \u201cdelight in tearing down the sacred, not so much airing dirty laundry as soiling it in front of you. \u201d Dwight Garner wrote that the first third of the book \u201creads like the most concussive monologues and interviews of Chris Rock, Richard Pryor and Dave Chappelle wrapped in a satirical yet surprisingly delicate literary and historical sensibility. \u201d \u201cHot Milk\u201d by Deborah Levy Levy\u2019s novel is about a young woman named Sofia who has traveled to Spain with her mother, Rose, in search of a cure for Rose\u2019s possibly psychosomatic ailments. In The Times, Sarah Lyall called the book \u201cgorgeous,\u201d and wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to be inside Sofia\u2019s insightful, questioning mind. \u201d In the Book Review, Leah Hager Cohen expressed mixed feelings: \u201cAs a series of images, the book exerts a seductive, arcane power, rather like a deck of tarot cards, every page seething with lavish, cryptic innuendo. Yet, as a narrative it is wanting. \u201d \u201cHis Bloody Project\u201d by Graeme Macrae Burnet Burnet\u2019s novel about a triple murder in   Scotland will be published in the U. S. on Oct. 18. It starts with a confession, so it\u2019s not a whodunit but a whydunit. \u201cMy primary interest is in the psychology of the character,\u201d Burnet recently told The Wall Street Journal, \u201crather than the mystery of what\u2019s happened. \u201d \u201cEileen\u201d by Ottessa Moshfegh One of the most widely praised debuts by an American writer this year, Moshfegh\u2019s novel is about a young woman working at a juvenile detention center in New England in the 1960s. On the cover of the Book Review, Lily King praised Moshfegh\u2019s sentences as \u201cplayful, shocking, wise, morbid, witty, searingly sharp,\u201d and said that as a character Eileen is \u201cas vivid and human as they come. \u201d \u201cAll That Man Is\u201d by David Szalay Szalay\u2019s novel is composed of nine narratives with different male protagonists. In the Book Review, Garth Greenwell praised the novel, while questioning its label: \u201cThe publisher calls \u2018All That Man Is\u2019 a novel, but there\u2019s very little explicitly interlinking its separate narratives. The stories cohere instead through their single project: an investigation of European manhood. \u201d \u201cDo Not Say We Have Nothing\u201d by Madeleine Thien Thien\u2019s latest novel, which will be published in the U. S. on Oct. 11, traces the effects of Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, from Mao\u2019s rise to the Tiananmen Square protests. It follows three musician friends through the country\u2019s changes. \u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6 The National Book Awards The National Book Awards are given in four categories: fiction, nonfiction, poetry and young people\u2019s literature. The longlists of 2016 finalists have been announced. The shortlists will be announced on Oct. 6 (moved up from the earlier announced date of Oct. 13) with the winners to follow on Nov. 16. The National Book Awards longlist for fiction: (Update: The following books were announced as shortlist finalists for this award: \u201cThe Throwback Special\u201d by Chris Bachelder, \u201cNews of the World\u201d by Paulette Jiles, \u201cThe Association of Small Bombs\u201d by Karan Mahajan, \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d by Colson Whitehead and \u201cAnother Brooklyn\u201d by Jacqueline Woodson.) \u201cThe Throwback Special\u201d by Chris Bachelder Bachelder\u2019s fourth novel follows a group of   men as they reunite for the 16th straight year of an odd ritual:   one of the most iconic and gruesome plays in football history, when the Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor sacked the Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann in 1985, shattering Theismann\u2019s leg and ending his career. In the Book Review, John Williams wrote that the novel\u2019s \u201cimaginative freshness allows for sly new questions to be implicitly asked about men\u2019s relationship to sports, to violence, to nostalgia and to one another. \u201d \u201cWhat Belongs to You\u201d by Garth Greenwell In this debut novel, a gay American poet narrates his experience in Bulgaria, where homosexuality remains a cultural taboo. Dwight Garner called it an \u201cincandescent\u201d book, in which \u201can old tale is made new, and made punishing. \u201d In the Book Review, Aaron Hamburger praised it as \u201ca rich, important debut, an instant classic to be savored by all lovers of serious fiction because of, not despite, its subject: a gay man\u2019s endeavor to fathom his own heart. \u201d \u201cImagine Me Gone\u201d by Adam Haslett Haslett\u2019s second novel centers on Michael, a man who has inherited his father\u2019s psychological instability. In the Book Review, Bret Anthony Johnston wrote: \u201cBy putting the readers in the same position as Michael\u2019s family members, Haslett has pulled off something of a brilliant trick: We feel precisely what they feel  \u2014   the frustration, the protectiveness, the hope and fear and, yes, the obligation. \u201d \u201cNews of the World\u201d by Paulette Jiles In this historical novel, being published in the U. S. this week, an elderly war veteran in 1870s Texas goes on a long journey with a    orphan, hoping to return her to relatives in San Antonio. \u201cThe Association of Small Bombs\u201d by Karan Mahajan Mahajan\u2019s second novel examines the effects of a terrorist bombing in Delhi on the families of two young boys who were killed. Fiona Maazel, in the Book Review, started her assessment like this: \u201cAllow me to skip the prelude to judgment that usually begins a book review, and just get right to it: Karan Mahajan\u2019s second novel, \u2018The Association of Small Bombs,\u2019 is wonderful. It is smart, devastating, unpredictable and enviably adept in its handling of tragedy and its fallout. If you enjoy novels that happily disrupt traditional narratives  \u2014   about grief, death, violence, politics  \u2014   I suggest you go out and buy this one. Post haste. \u201d \u201cThe Portable Veblen\u201d by Elizabeth McKenzie Jennifer Senior called McKenzie\u2019s latest novel \u201ca screwball comedy with a dash of mental illness a conventional tale of family pathos a sendup of Big Pharma a meditation on consumption, marriage, the nature of work. \u201d It also includes a squirrel that may or may not be communicating with the lead character. In the Book Review, Patricia Park said McKenzie \u201cadroitly skirts the line between the plausible and the absurd. \u201d \u201cSweet Lamb of Heaven\u201d by Lydia Millet A woman in Alaska flees her politically ambitious husband, with her daughter in tow, in the prolific Millet\u2019s latest novel. In the Book Review, Laura Lippman wrote: \u201cI have little patience with literary novels that claim to have the propulsive momentum of a thriller, yet Millet pulls it off. \u201d \u201cMiss Jane\u201d by Brad Watson Watson\u2019s novel is based on the life of a   in rural Mississippi in the early 20th century who couldn\u2019t have children and never married. In the Book Review, Amy Grace Loyd wrote: \u201cWatson\u2019s facility with upending expectations and upsetting the lines between all sorts of categories  \u2014   good and bad, normal and abnormal, pride and shame, love and hate  \u2014   is at its keenest and applied most carefully. \u201d \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d by Colson Whitehead Whitehead\u2019s   novel imagines the Underground Railroad as a literal mode of transportation. The book has been selected by Oprah Winfrey\u2019s book club, and has spent eight weeks and counting on The Times\u2019s   list. Michiko Kakutani called it \u201ca potent, almost hallucinatory novel that leaves the reader with a devastating understanding of the terrible human costs of slavery. \u201d In the Book Review, Juan Gabriel V\u00e1squez wrote: \u201cIn its exploration of the foundational sins of America, it is a brave and necessary book. \u201d \u201cAnother Brooklyn\u201d by Jacqueline Woodson Woodson is a celebrated writer of children\u2019s books (\u201cBrown Girl Dreaming\u201d and many others) and this is her first novel for adults in 20 years. In it, an anthropologist returns home for the funeral of her father and is spurred to memories of her girlhood. In the Book Review, Tayari Jones called the novel \u201chaunting\u201d and \u201cpowerfully insightful. \u201d \u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6 The National Book Awards longlist for nonfiction: (Update: The following books were announced as shortlist finalists for this award: \u201cStrangers in Their Own Land\u201d by Arlie Russell Hochschild, \u201cStamped From the Beginning\u201d by Ibram X. Kendi, \u201cNothing Ever Dies\u201d by Viet Thanh Nguyen, \u201cThe Other Slavery\u201d by Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez and \u201cBlood in the Water\u201d by Heather Ann Thompson) \u201cAmerica\u2019s War for the Greater Middle East\u201d by Andrew J. Bacevich The military historian Bacevich offers a history and critique of America\u2019s militarized approach to the Middle East. In the Book Review, David Rohde said that Bacevich\u2019s latest book \u201cextends his string of brutal, bracing and essential critiques of the pernicious role of reflexive militarism in American foreign policy. As in past books, Bacevich is   profane and fearless. \u201d \u201cThe Firebrand and the First Lady\u201d by Patricia   The story of Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s long friendship with Pauli Murray, a black woman born in 1910 who was a poet, memoirist, lawyer, activist and Episcopal priest. Irin Carmon, in the Book Review, wrote: \u201c  allows these women to speak for themselves, a light touch that works with two heavyweights. \u201d \u201cImbeciles\u201d by Adam Cohen Cohen revisits the U. S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1927 decision in Buck v. Bell, which upheld a statute that enabled the State of Virginia to sterilize \u201cmental defectives. \u201d On the cover of the Book Review, David Oshinsky called it \u201ca superb history of eugenics in America. \u201d Jennifer Senior felt the book was repetitive and disorganized, and wished Cohen spent \u201cmore time on the American obsession with the feebleminded  \u2014   which is by far the richest, most fascinating, most horrifying aspect of his book  \u2014   and less time in the courtroom. \u201d \u201cStrangers in Their Own Land\u201d by Arlie Russell Hochschild In this unprecedented election year, Hochschild\u2019s book takes a close look at Tea Party supporters in Louisiana. In the Book Review, Jason DeParle called it a \u201cgenerous but disconcerting\u201d work. \u201cWhile her hopes of finding common political ground seem overly optimistic, this is a smart, respectful and compelling book. \u201d \u201cStamped From the Beginning\u201d by Ibram X. Kendi In his latest, the historian Kendi looks at the long history of racist thought in America, and how it has been used to enforce discrimination. \u201cNothing Ever Dies\u201d by Viet Thanh Nguyen Nguyen won the Pulitzer Prize in April for his novel \u201cThe Sympathizer. \u201d That book was set against the Vietnam War. In this nonfiction work, Nguyen looks closely at the war, and at how it was perceived by the various sides involved. Nguyen discussed his work on the Book Review\u2019s podcast earlier this year. \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction\u201d by Cathy O\u2019Neil O\u2019Neil\u2019s book raises concern about the increasing role algorithms play in regulating people. Clay Shirky wrote: \u201cHer knowledge of the power and risks of mathematical models, coupled with a gift for analogy, makes her one of the most valuable observers of the continuing weaponization of big data. \u201d \u201cThe Other Slavery\u201d by Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez This ambitious history looks at the centuries during which tens of thousands of Native Americans were enslaved, and the profound effect the practice had on Indian populations across North America. \u201cThe Slave\u2019s Cause\u201d by Manisha Sinha Sinha, a professor of   studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, aims to connect the war against slavery in the United States to other liberation movements. \u201cIt is difficult to imagine a more comprehensive history of the abolitionist movement,\u201d Ira Berlin wrote in the Book Review. \u201cBlood in the Water\u201d by Heather Ann Thompson Thompson\u2019s account of the notorious Attica prison uprising in 1971 is one of the year\u2019s most discussed works of history. \u201cThis is not an easy book to read  \u2014   the countless episodes of inhumanity on these pages are heartbreaking,\u201d James Forman Jr. wrote in the Book Review. \u201cBut it is an essential one. \u201d Mark Oppenheimer wrote that \u201cnot all works of history have something to say so directly to the present,\u201d but Thompson\u2019s book, \u201cwhich deals with racial conflict, mass incarceration, police brutality and dissembling politicians, reads like it was   for the sweltering summer of 2016. \u201d \u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6 5 Under 35 The National Book Foundation, which administers the National Book Awards, has also announced the winners of its annual 5 Under 35 honors, which recognize five especially promising debut fiction writers under the age of 35. This year\u2019s winners are Brit Bennett (\u201cThe Mothers\u201d) Yaa Gyasi (\u201cHomegoing\u201d) Greg Jackson (\u201cProdigals\u201d) S. Li (\u201cTransoceanic Lights\u201d) and Thomas Pierce (\u201cHall of Small Mammals\u201d).'"}, "time": 1742563185.1191535}
