Snowden\u2019s former employer hires ex-FBI director to review security after 2nd data breach By 0 144 \\nBooz Allen Hamilton has hired an ex-FBI director to launch an external review of security and staffing procedures after an employee stole up to 500 million pages of data, marking the second NSA breach in just three years since the Snowden case. \\nCraig Veith, Booz Allen vice president for external relations, said on Thursday that Robert Mueller, who became director of the FBI one week before the 9/11 attacks and led the agency for 12 years, will conduct \u201ca fair, objective and thorough review,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. \\nRead more \\nThe announcement came after Harold Martin III, a former Booz Allen employee and US Navy veteran, was charged in what is believed to be one of the largest classified data breaches in US history. \\nEdward Snowden\u2019s case is likely to pale in comparison to that of Martin\u2019s when it comes to the number of documents stolen. Prosecutors said that Martin had taken as many as 500 million pages of top secret information, which equals 50 terabytes of data, along with six more boxes of files, many of which were reportedly left open in his house or car. \\nThe man, already dubbed \u2018the second Snowden\u2019, had nothing to do with blowing the whistle on NSA surveillance activities, his lawyers argued. Instead, they described Martin as a \u201cvoracious reader committed to being excellent at his work,\u201d according to the Washington Post. \\nMartin\u2019s attorney, James Wyda, told a US magistrate judge last week that gathering terabytes of classified information \u201cbegan as an effort to be better at his job,\u201d adding that he is \u201ca compulsive hoarder\u201d rather than a \u201ctraitor.\u201d \\nProsecutors insisted, however, that Martin remain in custody, alleging they found the names of US intelligence operatives in the files stolen by the former Booz Allen employee, citing a particular threat to the safety of officers working undercover abroad. \\nCommenting on Mueller\u2019s appointment, Booz Allen vice president Veith said that \u201cwe are an organization that prides itself on constant learning. If there are areas where Booz Allen can improve, we will address them.\u201d \\nAfter leaving the FBI in 2013, Mueller became a visiting professor at Stanford University where he focused on cyber-security issues. \\nQuestions, however, still remain about how these breaches could happen twice in just three years despite the company\u2019s assurances of learning lessons and improving internal control after Snowden\u2019s revelations that shed light on NSA wiretapping activities in the US and other countries. \\nColeen Rowley, a former FBI agent, told RT earlier in October that the number of US citizens having top secret clearances or access to classified information \u201chas soared\u201d through the years. \\n\u201cThe last I heard it is something like five million Americans have been cleared for classified information. So, any time you get that large of a number, you are going to have all kinds of potential. And it doesn\u2019t matter contractors or government, both of them,\u201d she said. \\nVia RT .
