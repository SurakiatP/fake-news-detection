[\u201cOne of the tenets of our show is artistic freedom, and over the years we\u2019ve shown we do believe in it,\u201d Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich said this weekend in an interview with Variety. \u201cHow many more times do we need to hear \u2018I\u2019d like to thank my publicist, my agent, my wife and kids.\u2019 The great acceptance speeches are ones that have a point of view and are more personal. \u201d  Sunday night\u2019s 59th annual Grammy Awards has been billed as a showdown between Beyonc\u00e9 and Adele, both up for Album of the Year, but plenty of music\u2019s biggest stars will be on hand in what could become a   ceremony. Beyonc\u00e9 leads all artists with nine nominations this year for her Black Lives   album Lemonade, while Drake, Rihanna, and Kanye West each earned eight nods. The Grammys have featured plenty of politics in recent years in 2014, 33 gay and straight couples were married during the ceremony as Macklemore and Ryan Lewis sang their hit LGBT anthem \u201cSame Love,\u201d while 2015 saw President Obama appear in a     PSA and last year saw rapper Kendrick Lamar delivering a   rendition of his hit song \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d from an elaborate prison set. If Ehrlich\u2019s show follows a similar path this year, Grammy viewers could be in for another night of fiery acceptance speeches and defiant performances, especially in the show\u2019s first broadcast since Donald Trump became president. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned from working with artists for 40 years is that they are   vital individuals who have interests that cover a broad spectrum of subjects and passions,\u201d Ehrich told Variety. \u201cWe should certainly allow for it on the broadcast. \u201d The Grammys are hardly the only awards show to heavily feature politics just last month, numerous actors used the podium at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to criticize President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. And in the first awards show of the year, Meryl Streep drew thunderous applause for an impassioned   speech while accepting a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes. The 59th annual Grammy Awards air Sunday night at 8 p. m. Eastern on CBS.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742562606.3334994}
