On Thursday, Mr. Snowden, the former government contractor who released a trove of National Security Agency documents and now lives in exile in Russia, credited WikiLeaks, a clearinghouse for similar disclosures, with furthering the cause of transparency but also criticized its unfiltered approach. His words prompted a swift and cutting reply from WikiLeaks, which had once come to his aid. Mr. Snowden, it suggested, was trying to ingratiate himself with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, just days after WikiLeaks had released embarrassing emails showing that Democratic Party officials had derided the campaign of her main rival in the primary, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

The exchange on Thursday was all the more striking in light of the past collaboration between Mr. Snowden and the group, which helped him as he sought to find a place to settle into exile. In June 2013, a WikiLeaks activist accompanied him as he made his way from Hong Kong to Moscow, a week after WikiLeaks\u2019 founder, Julian Assange, encouraged the government of Ecuador to accept Mr. Snowden\u2019s asylum request. \u201cMr. Snowden requested our expertise and assistance,\u201d Mr. Assange said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve been involved in very similar legal and diplomatic and geopolitical struggles to preserve the organization and its ability to publish. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561865.7845047}
