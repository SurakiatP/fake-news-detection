Let\u2019s turn it over to Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, for today\u2019s introduction. LOS ANGELES  \u2014   It\u2019s Election Day (again) on Tuesday in California, and while there are no particularly competitive races for office, two voter initiatives are potentially big enough to overshadow the sleepy   bid of Mayor Eric M. Garcetti. The first, Measure S, would impose a   moratorium on some new construction in the city of Los Angeles. It has created a fierce  \u2014   and   battle  \u2014   that has rekindled old debates about what Los Angeles should look like and the influence developers enjoy with elected officials. Southern California is going through a building boom, and the city has approved a series of dense and tall projects over the ire of some neighborhood groups upset not only with what they see as overdevelopment, but also the influence of   special interests at City Hall. They argue a   moratorium will force Los Angeles to adopt uniform zoning plans to guide how neighborhoods should handle developments. Opponents  \u2014   including Mr. Garcetti and labor unions  \u2014   warn it would be damaging to the economy and throttle any effort to build desperately needed affordable housing here. Both arguments have been played out in television advertisements and billboards across town. Mr. Garcetti has campaigned nearly as hard against the measure as he has for his own  . One side note here: Mr. Garcetti, who faces 10   opponents, needs to win 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff. Low turnout races can be dicey, especially with an initiative that could bring out people upset with the direction Los Angeles is taking under Mr. Garcetti. The second measure worth watching is a Los Angeles countywide sales tax increase to pay for services for the homeless. This follows a vote by Los Angeles city voters last year to finance $1. 2 billion in bonds to build housing for the homeless. Both measures would require a   vote by the electorate. Considering how much money will be released should this pass, Los Angeles could offer a test in the years ahead of a key question: Can government spend its way out homelessness?

To that end, a new plan: Each Monday, we\u2019ll come up with a question for you, solicit responses, then feature a handful by the end of the week. Here is one to kick things off. Two state lawmakers have introduced a measure that would allow bicyclists to treat stop signs like yield signs  \u2014   rolling through them slowly and stopping only if necessary. It sounds dangerous. But some bicycle groups argue that cyclists are in fact safer when they are allowed to move more freely. That\u2019s because they spend less time in intersections, where the risk of a collision is greater. Research has shown that a similar law enacted in Idaho resulted in fewer crashes. Opponents of the change argue that it would invite confusion about the rules of the road and possibly encourage (more) bad behavior among cyclists. What do you think? Should cyclists be allowed to roll through stop signs? Tell us, and please include your full name and city of residence: CAtoday@nytimes. com. California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
