Minnesota\u2019s governor called for a federal investigation into the police shooting of a black man, Philando Castile, during a traffic stop. Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, above, streamed the aftermath live on Facebook, immersing viewers in the grisly scene, below. It has been replayed more than four million times. With a composure periodically fractured by wailing, she described an officer shooting at least four times after Mr. Castile began complying with a request to produce his registration  \u2014   and alerted the officer that he had a licensed gun. An emotional President Obama said \u201call Americans should be troubled\u201d by the shootings caught on video this week in Minnesota and Louisiana. _____ 2. A House panel questioned the F. B. I. director, James Comey, for nearly four hours about the bureau\u2019s decision not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. Under strong Republican pressure, Mr. Comey reiterated that while Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email network as secretary of state showed \u201cgreat carelessness,\u201d it did not meet the bar for criminality. But he also said a series of her statements were untrue. Those included her assertions that none of the emails were marked classified and that she had turned over all   emails. _____ 3. Donald Trump held a series of meetings with congressional Republicans that turned rocky. A spokesman for Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the meeting had not persuaded him to endorse Mr. Trump, calling the election \u201ca Dumpster fire. \u201d Mr. Trump also raised a new wave of anxiety about his motives and temperament, hedging when asked about speculation that he might win the presidency but decline to serve. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know how I feel about it after it happens,\u201d he told our reporter. _____ 4. Democrats are seeking to leverage Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity among broad sectors of voters in other November elections. They plan to spend $1 million on ads painting the Republican Party as one with Mr. Trump. And several Democrats said Bernie Sanders would endorse Mrs. Clinton next week. _____ 5. Good news for the   : Researchers found that riding an electric bike  \u2014   one that supplements rather than replaces the rider\u2019s effort  \u2014   can still provide a workout comparable to brisk walking or an easy jog. And the 20 subjects reported that their rides were \u201ca blast,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author said. _____ 6. Germany took a significant step on women\u2019s rights. German lawmakers unanimously passed a law that makes it easier to prosecute violence against women. It defines rape as a violation of a woman\u2019s will, affirming that \u201cno means no. \u201d The measure includes a provision for abuses in crowds, which was added after reports of widespread sexual assault in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve. Above, a protest over those assaults in January. _____ 7. One of our   stories today is an essay by a former hedge fund trader on the damage done by pervasive, sexist \u201cbro talk\u201d in the financial world.   comments about women\u2019s bodies and sexual appeal, he writes, produce \u201ca force field of disrespect and exclusion that makes it incredibly difficult for women to ascend the Wall Street ladder. \u201d _____ 8. Opening this weekend: \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets,\u201d an animated,   frolic voiced by the likes of Louis C. K. Hannibal Buress, Jenny Slate, Kevin Hart and Ellie Kemper. Our reviewer writes, \u201cWhile this movie never achieves  \u2014   and does not really aim for  \u2014   the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features, or the sly social consciousness of \u2018Zootopia,\u2019 it has a playful absurdity and a winning, friendly spirit. \u201d _____ 9. \u201cThe lake was our mother and our father. Without this lake, where do we go?\u201d Our special report on the evaporation of Bolivia\u2019s   lake, Poop\u00f3, tracks the plight of indigenous people robbed of their way of life by climate change. The lake, after suffering decades of water diversions and El Ni\u00f1o droughts, basically disappeared in December, making climate refugees of those who once lived by its waters. _____ 10. President Obama left for Poland, where he will attend his final NATO summit meeting. The agenda promises to be crammed, given the need to address Russia\u2019s provocative policies in Eastern Europe, the Continent\u2019s migrant crisis, fears of more terrorism and, not least, the disruption of Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
