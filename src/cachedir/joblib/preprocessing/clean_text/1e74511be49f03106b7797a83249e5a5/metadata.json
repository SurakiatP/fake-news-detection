The city of Elk Grove in Sacramento County elected Steve Ly, the first Hmong mayor anywhere in the country. In Berkeley, Jesse Arreguin became the city\u2019s first Latino mayor. And in Stockton, voters elected not only the city\u2019s first black mayor, but also its youngest ever  \u2014   the    Michael Tubbs. Californians have in the past elected a number of   mayors, but perhaps never in a city the size of Stockton, with a diverse population north of 300, 000. (The League of California Cities said it did not track the ages of mayors.) Mr. Tubbs, a City Council member for the last four years, focused his campaign on renewal in a city that was hammered by the 2008 housing crisis. \u201cHe sort of represents, I think, people\u2019s hopes for the future of Stockton,\u201d said Keith W. Smith, an associate professor of political science at University of the Pacific, which has a campus in Stockton. Mr. Tubbs, a Democrat, won 70 percent of the vote, a result that was also seen as a repudiation of his rival. The campaign of the incumbent Mayor Anthony Silva, a Republican, was tainted by reports of improper conduct. The latest was an arrest over accusations that he gave alcohol to minors during a strip poker game. Mr. Silva did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cSo as much as the vote is for Michael Tubbs a lot of the vote is also against Anthony Silva,\u201d Professor Smith said. Mr. Tubbs was born in south Stockton to a teenage mother and an incarcerated father. He went on to graduate from Stanford and intern at Google and the White House, before going into politics. Speaking on Thursday, he said he was \u201ca little overwhelmed\u201d by his victory. \u201cComing from where I\u2019m from, living in poverty, not coming from a political family, it\u2019s an incredible honor,\u201d he said. Asked what his political future might hold, Mr. Tubbs said he was focused on the job at hand. As a    however, he was more candid. In 2008, Mr. Tubbs was part of a team that won a national debate competition sponsored by the N. A. A. C. P. As a result, he got to meet Senator Barack Obama, then the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. \u201dI looked at him, shook his hand and told him, \u2018I\u2019m next,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tubbs said, according to one local news account. \u201cHe said, \u2018O.

[The New York Times] People on San Francisco\u2019s sidewalks this week have been encountering kindness in an unusual way. Posters have appeared on poles across the city with little dangling paper slips that can be torn off and taken away. But instead of offering yoga lessons or a used sofa, they are simple written compliments  \u2014   and they\u2019re free. The posters are the brainchild of Anna Sergeeva, 26, a San Francisco artist. The idea came to her weeks before the presidential election, Ms. Sergeeva said, but she acknowledged that the mood in liberal San Francisco after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory inspired her to act on it. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing a marketing campaign for kindness,\u201d she said on Thursday. Since she and some friends put up a bunch of the posters last weekend, the campaign has taken off, fueled by the Instagram posts of   and the hashtag #thecomplimentproject. As momentum built, Ms. Sergeeva created a website in which other people could download the posters. She said people have reached out from Los Angeles, New York, Arizona, Colorado, Israel, France and Britain. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited and happy to part of something that feels special and needed at the moment. \u201d California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
