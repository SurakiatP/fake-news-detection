One by one on Thursday, inside an arena in downtown Orlando where friends and relatives of the victims of the nation\u2019s deadliest mass shooting had congregated, Mr. Obama embraced mourners sick with loss. He told them that the nation stood with them and that his own heart was broken, offering words of comfort for a tragedy that he confessed he could not fathom. \u201cTheir grief is beyond description,\u201d Mr. Obama said after a   meeting with the mourners. \u201cThrough their pain and through their tears, they told us about the joy that their loved ones had brought to their lives. \u201d Behind closed doors, Mr. Obama told the grieving that it was the 15th time during his      tenure that he had had to offer these sorts of condolences after a shooting, according to those who attended. \u201cThere were times when he choked up,\u201d said Angelica Jones, a performer at the Pulse nightclub, where a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 53 on Sunday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a hard thing to do when you\u2019ve got mothers crying out. He was up to it. \u201d Mr. Obama has had plenty of practice for this particularly grim task. The settings vary, but the pattern is chillingly constant. Mr. Obama\u2019s armored limousine deposits him at a nondescript building big enough to hold a large number of families whose loved ones have died in a mass shooting somewhere in America. Away from the news cameras that normally track his every interaction, he enters rooms thick with grief and the hushed voices of people in shock. He grasps for words of sympathy, comfort and condolence and offers long, tight embraces that the mourners will remember far more vividly than his words. His visit to Orlando came four days after the massacre. Accompanied by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the president entered the Amway Center, about two miles from the club, and the two men took turns hugging and grieving with the scores of people who lost sons, daughters, siblings, partners and friends. \u201cOur hearts are broken, too,\u201d Mr. Obama said he told them, after placing 49 white roses at a makeshift memorial nearby to commemorate each of those killed. In an emotional statement to reporters before he returned to Washington, Mr. Obama said the encounters with mourners underscored his determination to change the debate over gun restrictions and enact the sort of measures that might have prevented the tragedy. \u201cAs has been true too many times before, I held and hugged grieving family members and parents, and they asked, \u2018Why does this keep happening? \u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said. They pleaded for more to be done to stop the carnage, he said, adding, \u201cThose who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families. \u201d Beyond politics, the trip was a moment for the president to play the somber official role of consoler in chief. It was also the setting for a deeply personal and private set of encounters in which Mr. Obama, better known for his cool and unruffled temperament, dispenses with the trappings of his office and becomes an emotional father identifying with parents who have lost children. \u201cThe president understands that he is a symbol of the country, and when he travels to a community and meets with a family that has endured a terrible tragedy, he\u2019s offering a message of condolence and comfort on behalf of the American people,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday. \u201cBut it would be impossible for him to not be personally affected by these kinds of conversations and these kinds of interactions,\u201d he added. In such instances, Mr. Earnest said, the president \u201cdraws on his faith. \u201d As Mr. Obama comforted the mourners, his critics in Washington were blaming him for Sunday\u2019s tragedy. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and his 2008 presidential rival, told reporters on Capitol Hill that Mr. Obama, through his policy decisions, was \u201cdirectly responsible\u201d for the carnage because he had failed to thwart the rise of the Islamic State. The president has called visits like the one to Orlando among the most difficult duties he performs. Spending time with families who lost young children in the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. in 2012, was the \u201chardest day of my presidency,\u201d he said afterward. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had some hard days. \u201d So over and over again on Thursday, the president hugged the mourners tightly, relying on body language almost more than words to convey his support. \u201cHe took time to go to each family individually and embrace them, and there was no rush or a sense he wanted to be anywhere else,\u201d said Azsia Finn, a manager at Pulse. \u201cIt was embracing, hugging, just very warming. It felt like he cared. \u201d Amid a blur of sorrow and disbelief, these embraces have stood out to many of the mourners Mr. Obama has met after earlier tragedies. \u201cHe hugged each one of us individually  \u2014   and I mean hug, so that I was able to smell his cologne,\u201d said the Rev. Sharon Risher, 57, who lost her mother, Ethel Lance, and two cousins in the shooting in Charleston, S. C. last year, and met privately with Mr. Obama the next week. \u201cIt was not a little pat on the back. The intimacy of that hug is what I\u2019ll always remember. \u201d Mr. Obama takes his time with each family, listening to details that mourners are eager to offer about their lost loved ones. It is at once intimate and awkward he is aware of how disorienting it is for people to be meeting the president of the United States at the worst moment of their lives. Many of them forget they are talking to the president. At a high school in Newtown, Conn. in 2012, Mark Barden, whose    son, Daniel, was among the 26 killed at Sandy Hook two days earlier, decided, in what he now calls a fog of shock and trauma, to lecture Mr. Obama on the importance of spending time with his children. \u201cHe looked me in the eyes and said, \u2018I\u2019m coming from a recital right now,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Barden said in an interview, adding that he now finds the episode \u201chorrendously embarrassing. \u201d But Mr. Obama could relate, he said. \u201cHe was looking at this 100 percent as a father,\u201d Mr. Barden said. \u201cHe feels it in his heart as a human being, and it transcends his role as the leader of our country. \u201d Roxanna Green  \u2014   whose    daughter,   Green, was one of six people killed in a 2011 shooting in a supermarket parking lot in Tucson where Representative Gabrielle Giffords was holding an event  \u2014   said she had campaigned for Mr. Obama with her daughter and mother and had often dreamed of meeting him. \u201cBut you never want to receive a visit like that from anybody,\u201d Ms. Green, 50, said in an interview. \u201cHe said she was a beautiful girl, and he\u2019s so sorry, and it was just a horrible loss, and his girls are about the same age,\u201d she recalled.'"}, "time": 1742562305.3825507}
