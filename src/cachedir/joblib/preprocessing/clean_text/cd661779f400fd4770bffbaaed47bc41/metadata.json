As the troops near Mosul, however, Pentagon spokesman Col. John Dorrian insists there are no plans so far for troops to enter Mosul. \\nCol. Dorrian insisted that Iraq\u2019s government has said \u201cit\u2019s just gonna be their forces.\u201d He did, however, say he didn\u2019t want to say US troops would \u201cnever\u201d be involved, insisting that the plans could change at any time. \\nOther officials, quoted anonymously by Reuters , suggested that the definition of Mosul could also change, saying that suburbs and parts of the city\u2019s outskirts could easily be redefined as not Mosul, allowing US troops to enter those areas without having to technically \u201center Mosul.\u201d \\nThe Obama Administration initially promised \u201cno boots on the ground\u201d in Iraq, but with some 6,000 such troops in Iraq, they\u2019ve seen been trying desperately to claim they are in \u201cnon-combat\u201d roles. This too has been difficult to sell, with a number of those troops embedded in combat units. Those troops are nominally \u201cadvisers,\u201d but are regularly being put into combat areas.
