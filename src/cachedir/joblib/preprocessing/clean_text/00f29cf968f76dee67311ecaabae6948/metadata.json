Trump is making his influence felt on government funding deliberations in Congress, pressing Republican leaders to postpone action on spending bills until after he takes office. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on Thursday that the House would go along with the incoming administration\u2019s request and pass a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government running at current spending levels until March. \u201cI think they would like to have a   on how money\u2019s going to be spent going into the next year,\u201d he told reporters. But Republican leaders in the Senate did not immediately sign on to the plan, reflecting their desire to get contentious spending battles out of the way this year. Congress had been working toward agreement on spending bills by Dec. 9, when the current funding agreement expires. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, left open the possibility of an agreement with the House. \u201cDiscussions are also ongoing about how to fund the government and for how long,\u201d he said on the floor on Thursday. But signaling that the longstanding tensions between the House and Senate may not abate under a more unified Republican government, some Senate Republicans expressed concern that waiting until early next year could distract them from other legislative priorities. \u201cMy opinion is that it would be better to get this year done now,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and a member of the Appropriations Committee. \u201cMy preference is to do it now and not get bogged down early next year. \u201d The issue flared as both parties on Capitol Hill continued to adapt to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and his promise to shake up the way Washington works. Vice   Mike Pence visited the Capitol to meet with Republican and Democratic leaders, as well as House Republicans. And the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, drew a challenger on Thursday in her campaign to retain her post, as Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said the election outcome required Democrats to take a new approach. Startled by the number of   voters in states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania that shifted their support to Republicans  \u2014   particularly Mr. Trump  \u2014   Democrats have spent the week contemplating how to recapture those voters. Mr. Ryan, 43, who represents the quintessentially Rust Belt area of Youngstown, Ohio, said he believed he could help Democrats reach them. \u201cThe American people need to know we understand that they elected us to fight for economic opportunity for all,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe need to create America 2. 0  \u2014   a multicultural, progressive and innovative country that fights every day for ordinary people. \u201d Not selecting new leadership, Mr. Ryan said, would lead to \u201cmore disappointment in future elections. \u201d Ms. Pelosi, 76, has led House Democrats since 2003. In a letter to Democrats on Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi announced her bid for   and issued a warning to potential challengers, arguing she already had the support of   of House Democrats. And that was before she had even asked for any votes, Ms. Pelosi said on Thursday. \u201cWhen somebody challenges you, your supporters turn out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt almost did me a favor. \u201d Ms. Pelosi\u2019s confidence is not without basis. A prodigious   and effective negotiator, she has a strong and vocal base of support that on paper should help her easily defeat any challenges. However, members have noted a restlessness in recent days within the conference, where Mr. Ryan\u2019s message seemed to be resonating, which could end up blindsiding the leader. Further, her loss in a similar, far   struggle two years ago demonstrated cracks in her power. In 2014, a proxy battle between Ms. Pelosi and Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, broke out over a top spot on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Ms. Pelosi\u2019s pick, Representative Anna G. Eshoo of California, was defeated by Mr. Hoyer\u2019s choice, Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, stunning Ms. Pelosi. But Mr. Trump\u2019s early intervention on spending issues also highlighted the many challenges facing the Republican majority as it adapts to the priorities of a new administration. Referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d Mr. Ryan halted an effort at a   procedural meeting on Wednesday that would have lifted a ban on earmarks  \u2014   the   practice of allowing lawmakers to allocate money to specific projects in their states or districts  \u2014   promising instead to hold a vote on the proposal early next year. It has been several years since lawmakers passed a spending bill in time for the beginning of the fiscal year. Since Congress passed a stopgap measure in September, appropriators have been working to wrap up an agreement that would extend through the end of the government\u2019s fiscal year next Sept. 30 before the new Congress assembles in January. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, another Republican on the Appropriations Committee, was critical of continued reliance on   spending bills, which have become a regular fallback as lawmakers have failed to cobble together legislation palatable to both President Obama and the right wing of their own party. They are \u201ca really lazy way to govern,\u201d Mr. Alexander told reporters. \u201cI would think the last thing the Trump administration would want to do is spend time cleaning up an appropriations bill that was supposed to have been passed in the previous year under Obama,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563766.7570262}
