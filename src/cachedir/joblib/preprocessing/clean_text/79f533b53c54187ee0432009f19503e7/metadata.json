Priorities USA, the Democratic \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, is kicking off its advertising for the general election on Wednesday with a new ad, titled \u201cSpeak,\u201d that uses Donald J. Trump\u2019s own statements against him to depict him as a misogynist and unworthy of the White House. It is strikingly similar to a commercial broadcast in March by Our Principles PAC, a Republican group that sought unsuccessfully to derail Mr. Trump\u2019s march toward the party\u2019s nomination. The two ads cast a spotlight on many of the same remarks, with one essential difference: the voice that viewers hear. The Republican ad, \u201cQuotes,\u201d was released just before the Florida and Ohio primaries, and sought to spur outrage at Mr. Trump on behalf of \u201cour mothers,\u201d \u201cour sisters,\u201d \u201cour daughters. \u201d On the screen, seven different women take turns reading aloud Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, their expressions and inflections conveying their disdain, or outright disgust, for the lines they were asked to deliver. The Democratic ad, \u201cSpeak,\u201d grew directly out of \u201cQuotes,\u201d after tests by Priorities USA found that of all the   commercials, that one had resonated particularly well with voters that Priorities was hoping to persuade. But rather than hire actresses, Priorities said, it employed voters  \u2014   male and female  \u2014   who had not previously been familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s more offensive remarks about women. A more noticeable tweak: Rather than have them deliver Mr. Trump\u2019s lines for him, these people merely lip sync Mr. Trump\u2019s is the only voice heard. Message Our Principles PAC portrayed Mr. Trump\u2019s utterances as offensive to the women in voters\u2019 lives, appealing to viewers\u2019 sense of chivalry, in a way. Priorities USA puts the question more directly: \u201cDoes Donald Trump really speak for you?\u201d Priorities also brings men on camera. One, standing beside a young girl,   as Mr. Trump suggests that if Ivanka Trump were not his daughter, \u201cperhaps I\u2019d be dating her. \u201d Style The Priorities USA ad includes a percolating soundtrack, but it steals slightly from the impact of the words. Our Principles let each quote sink in. Bottom Line By using audio clips of Mr. Trump\u2019s voice, the Priorities USA ad heightens the immediate sense of authenticity. But the actresses in the Republican ad had greater freedom to add their own vocal interpretations  \u2014   which hammered home the point more effectively than a gesture or arched eyebrow can accomplish on its own.'"}, "time": 1742563501.989506}
