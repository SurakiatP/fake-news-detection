In his letter, he wrote:\\nIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\\nAccording to FBI officials, the emails were discovered after the bureau seized a device which was used by both the former congressman and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to the Clinton Campaign, which contained related information to their investigation into Weiner\u2019s \u201csexting\u201d escapade with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina.\\nHillary Clinton seems to be confident that the FBI will not bring charges against her.\\n\u201c[FBI Director James Comey] himself has said he doesn\u2019t know whether the emails\u2026 are significant or not,\u201d Clinton said to reporters on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July. Therefore it\u2019s imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay.\u201d\\nDonald Trump, speaking to a crowd in New Hampshire on Friday afternoon, tipped his hat to the FBI for having the \u201ccourage\u201d to correct \u201cthe horrible mistake that they made.\u201d\\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d Delivered by The Daily Sheeple \\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ). \\nContributed by The Daily Sheeple of www.TheDailySheeple.com . \\nThis content may be freely reproduced in full or in part in digital form with full attribution to the author and a link to www.TheDailySheeple.com.
