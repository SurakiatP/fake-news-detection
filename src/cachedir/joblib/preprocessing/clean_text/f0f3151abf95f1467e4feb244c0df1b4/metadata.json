You know he wanted quotas for blacks. You evoke King because you think he\u2019ll help you silence blacks and liberals. But it doesn\u2019t work, does it? That\u2019s because only whites\u2013and Asians, when it suits them\u2013even think in terms of \u201ccolorblindness.\u201d Blacks and Hispanics will squeeze every unfair advantage out of you they can. At what point will they ever abandon their aggressive racial agenda? When they\u2019re the majority just think how hard they\u2019ll squeeze your grandchildren. \\nAdvocates of white identity politics have two basic arguments at their disposal. The first argument could be called the racial preservationist argument, and the second could be called the collective interest argument. \\nThe first argument holds that national character reflects the genetics of the national population, therefore miscegenation and non-white immigration will radically alter the national character. As Jared Taylor put it, the future \u201cAfro-Hispanic-Caribbean-Asiatic America\u201d will be totally unrecognizable to the founding fathers, and completely alien from the America we grew up in. \\nWhatever relationship exists between national genetics and national culture, the preservationist argument has largely failed to persuade white Americans. In 1958 only 4 percent of Americans approved of white-black marriage, by 2013 87% of Americans approved of white-black marriage. For millennials, the numbers are even higher. \\nBut what about revealed preferences? For decades, white Americans have migrated from more homogeneous northern states to more diverse sunbelt states. In 2010, 9.4% of non-Hispanic white newlyweds married either a Hispanic person or a non-white person. \\nUndoubtedly, passionate opponents of interracial marriage still exist\u2013not all of them white\u2013but their arguments haven\u2019t persuaded many people. Any argument for white nationalism or white identity politics centered on the need for racial purity is pretty much dead on arrival, because most white people don\u2019t care about racial purity. \\nWith appeals to racial purity out of fashion, racialists are left with appeals to collective interest. At the Alt-right press conference, Jared Taylor warned white people that their children wouldn\u2019t simply be a minority, but \u201cthe way things are going, a hated minority.\u201d \\nThis quote sticks out. Within our prison system, violent race riots have claimed the lives of many inmates. Prisoners largely segregate themselves by race, and enforce a fairly rigid system of racial separation. Based on past experience, race appears to be a particularly violent and nasty fault line. \\nEven people who aren\u2019t racist will band together along racial lines, if they perceive themselves to be under threat. Most liberals find the idea of white people being persecuted ridiculous, and at the present moment it is. \\nBut the possibility of anti-white discrimination isn\u2019t as remote as many liberals would like to think. As J. Christian Adams documented, the Obama administration refused to prosecute minorities who engaged in voter intimidation. According to Adams they didn\u2019t simply drop charges against the NBPP members caught brandishing a club at voters in Philadelphia, they actually instructed the voting rights division not to prosecute any non-white person for voter intimidation. \\nIf a white president refused to prosecute racist white thugs for intimidating black voters, black people would be rightfully alarmed. There is no reason to expect whites to react differently. \\nAt this point, liberal readers will be saying to themselves, \u201cblacks are twelve percent of the population, what do we have to worry about?\u201d \\nExcept, when America becomes a majority minority nation, future presidents will no longer have to depend on white votes to get elected. Future leaders could build a coalition of black and Hispanic voters, held together by shared interests. \\nIf this is starting to make sense to liberal readers, keep reading, it gets worse. Non-white immigrants benefit from a host of affirmative action and \u201cdiversity\u201d programs. In other words, immigration increases the political clout of affirmative action beneficiaries. Why exactly should white people welcome immigrants who will be favored over them? \\nEspecially galling is the fact that many affirmative action beneficiaries are neither poor nor disadvantaged. What are poor whites in West Virginia supposed to think about millionaire Cuban immigrants being favored over them? \\nThis author supports moderate immigration restriction of the type advocated by the likes of Jorge Borges or Mark Krikorian; however, he does not want white Americans to hate or fear non-white immigrants. Liberals, on the other hand, seem intent on pursuing policies almost guaranteed to revive white racism. \\nThis article began with a quote from Jared Taylor\u2019s letter to cuckservatives. He should add liberals to his mailing list. Liberals supplied Jared with his most persuasive argument; they deserve a thank you note and a gift card.'"}, "time": 1742628546.6864662}
