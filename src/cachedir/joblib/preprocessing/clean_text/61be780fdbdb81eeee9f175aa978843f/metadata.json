She\u2019s not letting a holiday like Halloween hold her back from her scheduled speaking engagements, scaring everyone she meets with what she inadvertently decided to dress up as. \\nThe troubled Democratic candidate showed up at Kent State University to greet another anemic crowd that she\u2019s become accustomed to seeing. While she thought she was treating them with her presence, the \u201ctrick\u201d was actually on her when everyone took a closer look at what she was wearing and saw the irony in it based on everything Americans have seen over recent weeks. \\nWhile she didn\u2019t depart from her typical androgynous pantsuit garb, there was something else about her outfit hidden in plain sight. As the American Mirror point out, every inch of the draping fabric she had on was crimson red, making her appear like she dressed as a walking blood clot for Halloween. \\nSince clots have been suspected as contributing to her health issues, which she\u2019s had a hard time hiding, the irony of the outfit wasn\u2019t lost on those looking for deeper meaning in what she picked to wear on this particular holiday. Hillary Clinton in all crimson red at Kent State today on Halloween \\nAccording to The Sun , Hillary has been known to have clotting issues in the past when they reported on this condition in September. \u201cClinton had a long history of ill health starting with a blood clot in 1998 while her husband Bill was commander-in-chief,\u201d the source explained. \u201cThe \u2018Venous thromboembolism\u2019, which was located behind her right knee, resulted in her foot ballooning in size.\u201d \\nThe article added that Hillary is on a daily regimen of blood-thinning medications to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u201cafter suffering two other clots in 2009 and 2012,\u201d one of which was discovered in her brain. \\nThe symbolism potentially runs deep in this color choice as it\u2019s one of her few appearances she\u2019s made since Friday when the FBI announced that they were looking back into her e-mails, which possibly mean the end of the road for her. Red represents anger, which she surely feels inside, or perhaps it\u2019s a hidden message that the election will end with a win for Republicans whose party is represented by this bold color.'"}, "time": 1742561929.3382556}
