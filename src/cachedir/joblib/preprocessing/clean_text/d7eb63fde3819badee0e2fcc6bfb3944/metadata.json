In May 2013, Apple got into a pickle because it had decided to fund its stock-buy-back and dividend program by taking on a record $17 billion in debt rather than \u201crepatriating\u201d part of its \u201coffshore\u201d cash and paying income taxes on it. \\nThe Senate subcommittee investigation and hearings, chaired by Senator John McCain , showed that Apple had sheltered at least $74 billion from US income taxes between 2009 and 2012 by using a \u201ccomplex web\u201d of offshore mailbox companies. The investigation found untaxed \u201coffshore\u201d profits of $102 billion held by Irish subsidiaries \u2013 which Apple refused to \u201crepatriate\u201d in order to keep that income from being taxed in the US. \\nBut according to the Senate report, Apple doesn\u2019t have to repatriate that moolah because it\u2019s already in the US. The Irish mailbox subsidiaries, on whose books this money is for tax purposes, transferred it to Apple\u2019s bank accounts in New York. The money is managed by an Apple subsidiary in Reno, Nevada, and is invested in all kinds of assets in the US. Apple\u2019s accountants in Austin, Texas, keep the books, \\nMoney doesn\u2019t stop at borders. Tax accounting does. \\nThese revelations explained another corporate mystery that had long baffled economists. In 2004, after heavy lobbying by our Corporate Titans, Congress declared a \u201crepatriation holiday\u201d to encourage the \u201creturn\u201d of $300 billion in overseas cash to be invested in the US. This would cause a burst of investment and hiring in the US, it was said. This was similar to what Moody\u2019s is now clamoring for on behalf of its clients, except this time, they want permanent tax reform rather than a one-time \u201crepatriation holiday.\u201d \\nSo in 2004, our heroes made some adjustments on their books to \u201crepatriate\u201d these profits that were then taxed at the special and minuscule rate of 5.25%, less than the payroll taxes withheld from their US working stiffs. \\nAnd then nothing happened. There were no investments and no hiring and no benefits for the economy because the money had already been deployed in the US, as we now know. In May 2013, as a result of the Senate hearings, the New York Times summarized the 2004 phenomenon this way: \\nOn the contrary, some of the companies that brought back the most money laid off thousands of workers, and a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research later concluded that 92 cents on every dollar was used for dividends, stock buybacks or executive bonuses. \\nThis sort of \u201crepatriation holiday\u201d or tax reform would simply be a handout benefitting our Corporate Titans, but not the millions of smaller companies that don\u2019t have the resources to lobby Congress, make special deals with foreign governments, and create that \u201ccomplex web\u201d of offshore mailbox companies. They\u2019re too busy struggling on a daily basis in their dog-eat-dog world. \\nSubcommittee Chairman John McCain thundered in his opening statement of the hearings that it was \u201cunacceptable that corporations like Apple are able to exploit tax loopholes to avoid paying billions in taxes.\u201d Since then, nothing happened in Congress. The loophole wasn\u2019t closed. And the falsehoods that had been stabbed many times during the hearings have once again risen to shine in even greater glory, with Moody\u2019s adding some additional sparkle. \\nHot air keeps hissing out of IPOs.
