[A Facebook post from the Georgetown College Democrats included a link to a form for students to fill out who were willing to host protesters looking to attend the Women\u2019s March on Washington.  \u201cGiven our location in DC, we are calling all College Democrats to open up their dorm rooms or apartments to help house other college students for the weekend,\u201d the post says. \u201cFloor or couch space is much needed to host as many students as possible at Georgetown. \u201d Although the Georgetown administrators claim that students are permitted to host friends and family during inauguration weekend, they advised against hosting individuals that they didn\u2019t know. \u201cFor your safety and the safety of your fellow residents, you are discouraged from inviting guests, with whom you are not familiar, to stay with you,\u201d the statement reads. Meredith Forsyth, the president of the Georgetown College Democrats, claims that all guests will be \u201cproperly approved and vetted\u201d by the Women\u2019s March on Washington organization.
