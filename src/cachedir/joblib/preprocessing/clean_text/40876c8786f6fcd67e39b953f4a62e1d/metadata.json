The United States wants its troops in position by June. \\nLondon is also sending Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania to patrol around the Black Sea, partly in support of Turkey. \\n\u201cAlthough we are leaving the European Union, we will be doing more to help secure the eastern and southern flanks of NATO,\u201d Fallon said. \\nSYRIAN SHADOW \\nOthers NATO allies joined the four battle groups led by the United States, Germany, Britain and Canada to go to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Canada said it was sending 450 troops to Latvia, joined by 140 military personnel from Italy . \\nGermany said it was sending between 400 and 600 troops to Lithuania, with additional forces from the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Croatia and Luxembourg. \\nStoltenberg said allies\u2019 commitments would be \u201ca clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.\u201d Diplomats said it would also send a message to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has complained that European allies do not pay their way in the alliance. \\nSEND A MESSAGE ALSO TO TRUMP!!!! \\nIT\u2019S NOT JUST ISIS OR UKRAINE WE\u2019RE SAVING HERE \u2013 WE ALSO HAVE TO STOP DONALD TRUMP!!! \\nThe choice is very clear: \\nWill we allow Putin to help Assad barrel bomb his own people by bombing ISIS and thus deny Syrian babies of human rights? \\nOr will we launch a massive World War inside of Europe to stop human rights atrocities in Syria? \\nI think we all know the morally correct answer to this question. \\nBut still though. Let\u2019s have a referendum, just to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page here.'"}, "time": 1742628565.9379776}
