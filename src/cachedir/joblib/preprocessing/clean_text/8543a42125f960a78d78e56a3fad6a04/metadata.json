Based on its size and movements, scientists have concluded that it\u2019s a vast cloud pattern generated by a gigantic, perpetual hurricane spinning at the center of the planet\u2019s north pole. Scientists estimate that this storm has been raging for decades \u2013 maybe even centuries.\\nEach side on the northern polar hexagon is approximately 13,800 km long, and the whole structure rotates once every 10 hours and 39 minutes -a day on Saturn. In just four years, Saturn\u2019s hexagon has changed its color from blue to gold when Saturn\u2019s north pole gears up for next year\u2019s summer solstice.Saturn\u2019s hexagon is a six-sided structure that spans roughly 32,000 km (20,000 miles) in diameter, and extends about 100 km (60 miles) down into the planet\u2019s dense atmosphere. Because Saturn does not have land masses or oceans on its surface to complicate weather the way Earth does, its conditions should give scientists a more elementary model to study the physics of circulation patterns and atmosphere, said Kevin Baines, an atmospheric scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., who has studied the hexagon with Cassini\u2019s visual and infrared mapping spectrometer. The last visible-light images of the entire hexagon were captured by NASA\u2019s Voyager spacecraft nearly 30 years ago, the last time spring began on Saturn. After the sunlight faded, darkness shrouded the north pole for 15 years. Much to the delight and bafflement of Cassini scientists, the location and shape of the hexagon in the latest images match up with what they saw in the Voyager pictures.\\n\u201cThe longevity of the hexagon makes this something special, given that weather on Earth lasts on the order of weeks,\u201d said Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery on par with the strange weather conditions that give rise to the long-lived Great Red Spot of Jupiter.\u201d\\nThe hexagon was originally discovered in images taken by the Voyager spacecraft in the early 1980s. It encircles Saturn at about 77 degrees north latitude and has been estimated to have a diameter wider than two Earths. The jet stream is believed to whip along the hexagon at around 100 meters per second (220 miles per hour).\\nEarly hexagon images from Voyager and ground-based telescopes suffered from poor viewing perspectives. Cassini, which has been orbiting Saturn since 2004, has a better angle for viewing the north pole. But the long darkness of Saturnian winter hid the hexagon from Cassini\u2019s visible-light cameras for years. Infrared instruments, however, were able to obtain images by using heat patterns. Those images showed the hexagon is nearly stationary and extends deep into the atmosphere. They also discovered a hotspot and cyclone in the same region.\\nAs observed by NASA\u2019s Voyager and Cassini spacecraft, each point of the hexagon appears to rotate at its center at nearly the same rate that Saturn rotates on its axis. Along the rim of the hexagon, a jet stream of air is blasting eastward at speeds of 321 km/h (200 mph).\\nWhile we\u2019re pretty confident that we know what Saturn\u2019s hexagon is, the big mystery is how it got there in the first place. Once you have a giant whirlpool of air, it\u2019s relatively easy to keep it spinning \u2013 but the force you need to get it wound up in the first place is a whole lot more difficult to explain.\\nIt\u2019s fascinating that the Cassini spacecraft could have observed two completely different colors in the hexagon between November 2012 and September 2016:\\n\\nThe best hypothesis is that this is what it looks like when Saturn changes seasons. With a year that lasts 29 Earth years, Saturn changes seasons only once every seven years, and the increased sunlight over the past three years could explain the golden haze.\\n\u201cThe color change is thought to be an effect of Saturn\u2019s seasons. In particular, the change from a bluish colour to a more golden hue may be due to the increased production of photochemical hazes in the atmosphere as the north pole approaches summer solstice in May 2017.\u201d\\n\u201cInside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true,\u201d Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University, explained back in 2013. \u201cThe hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth\u2019s Antarctic ozone hole.\u201d\\nBut since Saturn reached its equinox in August 2009 \u2013 the point where the Sun is directly over Saturn\u2019s equator \u2013 it\u2019s been gradually exposed to more and more sunlight, which means that for the past three years, aerosols have been produced inside of the hexagon and around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy and golden when photographed last month.\\n\u201cOther effects, including changes in atmospheric circulation, could also be playing a role,\u201d NASA explained this week. \u201cScientists think seasonally shifting patterns of solar heating probably influence the winds in the polar regions.\u201d\\nNASA scientists have an investigation underway to figure out what\u2019s actually going.\\nThe Daily Galaxy via NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute/Hampton University \\nSource: The Daily Galaxy \\n'"}, "time": 1742563968.7579873}
