When it came to the race card, Brunell was lethal, cutting down his every liberal lie. She tore him apart, then kicked him to the curb, as another Michelle and Hillary spokesman bit the dust. Michelle Obama\u2019s favorite pundit Brian Benjamin (left), Hillary & her hot sauce (middle), Brunell Donald-Kyei (right) \\nBrian Benjamin kept an arrogant smile on his face as Donald Trump\u2019s Diversity Chairwoman Brunell Donald-Kyei surgically sliced through Hillary\u2019s pandering to the black community. They appeared on Fox and Friends a few days ago and the video is only getting more popular as interest in Brunell\u2019s tactics is making headlines. \\nUnsurprisingly, Fox & Friends Monday has been focusing on the latest to emerge out of the WikiLeaks scandal, and one detail concerning the use of the phrase \u201c yo mama ,\u201d suggested a pandering effort to an African American crowd by Clinton earlier this year. Joining Fox & Friends to discuss was vice-chair of the Trump National Diversity Coalition Brunell Donald-Kyei who said, \u201cThe pandering is not working. Black people just want a real seat at the table.\u201d [via Mediaite ] \\nAs Brunell laid Benjamin out cold, he had to pull out the race card, but that was a wrong move. Brunell was waiting for it, and she launched into a tirade that made Hillary and her \u201chot sauce\u201d in my purse comment look as stupid as it sounded, as poor Steve Doocy tried to moderate. \\nBrunell went off, saying the communities need jobs, not hot sauce and \u201cyo mama\u201d jokes. She added that the black community wants empowerment and the Democratic party to keep its promises. Benjamin was quick to interrupt, alleging Trump talks about law and order but ignores systemic issues between the community and the police. However, Brunell wasn\u2019t about to let him get away with his lie. \\nShe quickly pointed out that mass incarceration happened under Bill and Hillary Clinton, telling Benjamin that he knows that too. \u201cHis wife [Hillary] was ok with that. So don\u2019t go there,\u201d she said. \u201cLet Donald Trump fix it. Let a person who is a builder and a doer fix it.\u201d \\nBenjamin tried to retort, calling Trump a racist, and that\u2019s all it took to really cause Brunell to unleash. \u201c Not a loser, not a taco bowl, or needy Latino? Really? Are we going there? Catholics are bastardized. Are we going there? \u201c she asked, referring to the WikiLeaks emails that exposed the Hillary camp\u2019s true thoughts and nasty remarks about many Americans. \\nBenjamin shot back, \u201cYea, let\u2019s go there,\u201d before Brunell finished him off, saying, \u201cI went there, WikiLeaks is out in the streets, Sir. I read WikiLeaks. I read about the corruption.\u201d \\nThis exchange proves that when these Hillary shills get beat, they turn to the race card every time. When Brunell hears that, as a black woman, she can go full throttle at Benjamin, and his nervous laughter and scoffing means he is embarrassed and lost this argument, which shreds Hillary\u2019s whole narrative about why Americans shouldn\u2019t vote for Trump. \\nHillary is a one note wonder. She has no positive record to run on, and her whole campaign is based on bullying Trump supporters. In her narrative, Trump is a Nazi and so are those of us who support him. So, we are fair game to be bullied \u2014 on the internet or in person as we have seen the paid thugs do. \\nIt\u2019s all smoke and mirrors because it just doesn\u2019t hold true, and Brunell brought that out as she left Benjamin, one of Hillary\u2019s token black spokesmen, to languish as he failed to make anyone believe the lie Hillary is trying to sell to Americans. This is all Hillary\u2019s got to run on, and it will not be enough to win.'"}, "time": 1742561861.2053404}
