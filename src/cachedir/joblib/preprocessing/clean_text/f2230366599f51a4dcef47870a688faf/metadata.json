And the question is, is this just a coincidence, or could it possibly have something to do with the election of the 45th president of the United States of America? Now, in part, what we\u2019re seeing is connected to a historic backlash that has often occurred throughout this journey that we\u2019ve been on here in America, that whenever we make significant progress, there\u2019s always a backlash amongst some in America who\u2019ve got a problem with the fact that we\u2019ve done things designed to be more consistent with our values of liberty and justice for all, equal protection under the law. \u201d After listing historical examples of this, Jeffries stated, \u201d And then, of course, we\u2019ve got Barack Obama, who was elected in what many of us viewed as an incredible step in the right direction,   having gone from the outhouse to the White House. Eight years of tremendous progress in moving this country forward, followed by the election of Donald Trump, a man who spent five years perpetrating the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America. And many of us are wondering, why were so many people who worship at the altar of white supremacy drawn to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign? What was it about this individual that so many folks dripping in hatred flocked to his candidacy? That\u2019s not to say that every American who voted for Donald Trump is a racist. We do know that every racist in America voted for Donald Trump. that\u2019s a problem. \u201d He concluded, \u201cAnd so, again, I just ask the question in closing, is this all a big coincidence? We know part of it is the backlash that has often occurred whenever we\u2019ve made progress in America, but this president has a responsibility to address the rise in hate crimes that have taken place on his watch, whether or not his election is directly connected to it. \u201d (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742563265.1611378}
