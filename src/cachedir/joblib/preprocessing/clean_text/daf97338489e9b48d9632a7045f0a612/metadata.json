Salt lamps are blocks of pure Himalayan salt, so they come from the same region of the world. Also known as the \u2018Vitamins of the Air\u2019, they are made from the salt that came from ancient oceans, and serve as a perfect air ionizer. How Himalayan Salt Lamps Work? \\nHimalayan salt lamps emit negative ions in the air which are healthy for the human body. The ionization is supported by the bulb inside of the salt block since the bulb heats the salt block around it. Himalayan salt attracts the water around it and this process called as hygroscopic. Therefore, the Himalayan salt lamps may become dump or wet, especially in an environment with high humidity. As the bulb heats the salt lamp, the water evaporates and the negative ions are released in the air. The negative ions bind with the positive harmful ions such as allergens, molds and bacteria, and neutralize the environment in the house. Improve Blood Flow \\nParticular studies have suggested that negative ions, such as those emitted by Himalayan salt lamps, can accelerate blood flow. This boost helps to improve several disorders of the vascular system and can prevent certain damage to the lungs. Purify Air \\nDust, pollen, cigarette smoke and other pollutants ruin the purity of the air we breathe, and the perfect way to neutralize it is to use Himalayan salt lamp on your room. It acts as air purifier through its ability to absorb water and evaporating them after. They attract water molecules in the air, which traps impurities in the air and leaves you with fresh, clean air: this is known as hygroscopy. Good Vibrations \\nSalt has been used through out the ages to clean energies from homes and people. You can use Salt to clear crystals, clear your body and clear your home. Because Salt Crystals vibrate at a frequency closer to the earths magnetic frequency known as the shuman resonance frequency they can also help bring us back in balance. Boost Energy Levels \\nPositive ions deplete the body of energy, and it is believed that Himalayan salt lamps can actually do the opposite. The negative ions increase energy levels, which yields a refreshing effect similar to the feeling of rejuvenation achieved from spending time in nature. Improve Your Breathing \\nAsthma and other breathing complications can be triggered by polluted, corrupted air. Salt lamps ensure that you breathe cleaner air whenever you are around them, helping to improve breathing and prevent contaminants from entering your lungs. Other Benefits of Using Himalayan salt lamp \\nBalancing pH to strengthening bones and lowering blood pressure Reduce morning sickness, some type of depression Reduce asthma attack and allergy symptoms Reduce allergic reaction'"}, "time": 1742564111.640569}
