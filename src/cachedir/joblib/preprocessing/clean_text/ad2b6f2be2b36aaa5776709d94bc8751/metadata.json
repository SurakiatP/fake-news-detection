Last week we announced an inaugural \u201cCalifornian of the Year\u201d contest, and asked readers to write in with nominations. Emails poured into our inbox, with names of politicians, environmentalists, homeless advocates and sports figures, among others. A number of entries were personal in nature. Some workers suggested their bosses (lucky you). One man nominated his father, who died this year. To create a roster of finalists, we included people who were mentioned more than a handful of times, then added some wild cards for good measure. They are, in alphabetical order: \u2022 Andy Bales. The C. E. O. of Union Rescue Mission has dedicated his life to helping the homeless in Los Angeles. \u2022 Marc Benioff. The Salesforce C. E. O. has made philanthropy a central part of the company\u2019s mission. \u2022 Barbara Boxer. The Democratic senator is retiring after 34 years of representing California in Congress. \u2022 Jerry Brown. California\u2019s   governor has pushed ambitious agendas. \u2022 Nicole Capretz. The Climate Action Campaign founder is a force in environmental advocacy in San Diego. \u2022 Betty Chinn. Known as the Chinese Mother Teresa, she has been a lifeline to Eureka\u2019s homeless. \u2022 Kamala Harris. California\u2019s new senator is seen as having a bright future on the national and state stages. \u2022 Colin Kaepernick. The 49ers quarterback\u2019s national anthem protest polarized fans and incited debate. \u2022 Elon Musk. The serial entrepreneur seems to embody the creative daring of Silicon Valley. \u2022 Vin Scully (see below). As for me, I\u2019m going with Mr. Scully, the gentlemanly broadcaster who retired in October after 67 years as the voice of Dodgers baseball. As the Los Angeles Times sportswriter Bill Plaschke put it, Mr. Scully \u201cis the soundtrack of our lives, the dignified and graceful accompaniment of endless sandy summers, a daily harmonic reminder of the Southern California dream. \u201d After the results are in, we\u2019ll reveal a winner by the end of the year. \u2022 The cost of the 405 highway project in Los Angeles has now reached $1. 6 billion.

[Sacramento Bee] \u2022 California\u2019s Supreme Court halted a   measure that would have sped up death penalty appeals.

[The New York Times] \u2022 A libations columnist offered a list of the best 25 California wines that he tasted this year. [Orange County Register] Does the Bay Area have a superiority complex? James Hetfield seems to think so. During a recent interview on the comedian Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast, the Metallica frontman said the region\u2019s \u201celitist attitude\u201d played a part in his family\u2019s decision to leave their longtime home in Marin County and move to Vail, Colo. \u201cI kind of got sick of the Bay Area, the attitudes of people there,\u201d he said. Mr. Hetfield, 53, cited his love of hunting as one point of friction. \u201cThey talk about how diverse they are and things like that,\u201d he told Mr. Rogan. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fine if you\u2019re diverse like them. But showing up with a deer on the bumper doesn\u2019t fly in Marin County. \u201d San Francisco has topped a number of rankings of cities for \u201csnobbery,\u201d as have several other Bay Area locations. The reputation was even parodied (in gross fashion) during a 2006 episode of \u201cSouth Park\u201d titled \u201cSmug Alert!\u201d Mr. Hetfield had other conflicts in Marin County. He once angered fellow residents by erecting a fence on his property near San Rafael that blocked a popular trail. In his conversation with Mr. Rogan, he said he fit in better in Colorado, where his wife, Francesca, grew up. \u201cIn Colorado everyone is very natural,\u201d he said. Writing in SFist in 2013, the San Francisco journalist Rose Garrett acknowledged that the city\u2019s residents are at times guilty of an air of superiority. She added: \u201cBut that\u2019s only because we\u2019ve got a good thing going, and we know it. \u201d California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.
