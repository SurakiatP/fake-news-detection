He has been a reporter and editor at several suburban newspapers in the Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, areas and also served as managing editor of Triangle Business Journal in Raleigh, North Carolina. Print Hillary Clinton with top aide Huma Abedin. \\nWikiLeaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what Hillary Clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration, but Clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations. \\nShe has focused instead on criticizing the Russians as the source of the hacks, despite the fact there is no proof of Russian involvement. \\nThe emails also shed light on how the Clinton campaign interacts with Wall Street banks, with friendly media, and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of Democratic rival Bernie Sanders with the help of the DNC. \\nWikiLeaks says it has about 50,000 emails from the private Gmail account of John Podesta, a senior Democratic Party official who has served as White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser to President Obama. He was the author of Obama\u2019s climate change policy. John Podesta \\nIn February Podesta moved seamlessly from the White House to become chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \\nHere are some of the most explosive revelations from the WikiLeaks email dumps featuring Podesta\u2019s account and others. \\nPreference for Muslim Americans In 2008, when Podesta served as co-chair of President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s transition team, Michael Froman, a former Citibank executive, sent Podesta a \u201clist of African American, Latino and Asian American candidates, broken down by Cabinet/Deputy and Under/Assistant/Deputy Assistant level, plus a list of Native American, Arab/Muslim American and Disabled American candidates.\u201d The Arab American list came with a special note to exclude Arab Christians \u2013 they had to be both Arab and Muslim.As New Republic reports, Obama\u2019s eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as Froman recommended.Froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis. \\nShielding Obama In a March 4, 2015, email to Hillary Clinton\u2019s lawyer Cheryl Mills, Clinton\u2019s eventual campaign chairman Podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between Clinton and President Obama that were sent over Clinton\u2019s private server.The day before Podesta sent his email to Mills, the House Benghazi Committee privately told Clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails.The email from Podesta to Mills says: \u201cThink we should hold emails to and from potus? That\u2019s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will.\u201d An email exchange between Podesta, Paul Begala, and Clinton pollster GQRR shows the Clinton campaign was pushing the Muslim Obama narrative back in January 2008. Included was a survey of Obama \u201cnegative facts\u201d such as this one: \u201cObama (owe-BAHM-uh)\u2019s father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the world\u2019s most populous Islamic country.\u201d The pollster writes \u201cwe have reworked the Obama message into the survey, as requested.\u201d \\nSecret speeches to Wall Street Hillary Clinton was so enraged that Bill Clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley in 2015 that she \u201cneeded a cool down period.\u201d The email chain, on March 11, 2015, before she formally launched her campaign, includes top aides to both Hillary Clinton and former President Clinton, and reveals that Hillary\u2019s future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of Bill giving a speech to a Wall Street bank. \u201cMorgan Stanley is coming down,\u201d wrote Robby Mook in an email to top Clinton aides.Top aide Huma Abedin explained that Hillary would not be happy about it, writing: \u201cHRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech. I will have to tell her that [Bill] chose to cancel it, not that we asked.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms, a point of contention during this year\u2019s primary, were the subject of an email to Podesta. Excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by Clinton\u2019s research team, including the necessity of having \u201cboth a public and a private position\u201d on issues. It was just part of \u201cmaking sausage\u201d in the political arena, she said, that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public. Some \u201cflags\u201d in Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches were noted in a Jan. 25 email from campaign research director Tony Carrk to top Clinton advisers, including Clinton\u2019s declaration that \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.\u201d Countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as \u201cfact checkers\u201d tried to downplay this email by saying it was \u201cmostly about trade,\u201d not immigration, as if the words \u201copen borders\u201d were never mentioned. But the email exchange also shows how Hillary\u2019s about-face on the TPP trade deal was mere pandering to Bernie Sanders\u2019 voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals. In a speech at Goldman-Black Rock on Feb. 4, 2014, Carrk pointed out, Clinton admitted she\u2019s \u201cKind Of Far Removed\u201d from middle-class struggles due to \u201cThe Economic, You Know, Fortunes That My Husband And I Now Enjoy.\u201d Clinton, in other speeches, boasted of her ties to Wall Street, an issue primary opponent Bernie Sanders continually raised. Clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns. \\nWorking in tandem with \u2018friendly\u2019 media WND reported Tuesday emails showing reporters, editors and contributors not just advocating for Hillary Clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign. Univision Chairman Haim Saban urged the Clinton campaign to hit Donald Trump harder over immigration. The Boston Globe tried to time a Clinton opinion piece to do the most good in New Hampshire. CNBC\u2019s John Harwood urged Clinton campaign chairman Podesta to watch out for then-GOP candidate Dr. Ben Carson. Democratic National Committee official and CNN contributor Donna Brazile apparently tipped off the Clinton campaign to a potentially difficult CNN town-hall question on capital punishment during the Democratic Party primary season. Brazile adamantly denies it . In a July 2015 email, New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich appeared to ask permission from Hillary Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article. Palmieri replied, suggesting he remove a reference Clinton made to Sarah Palin and delete Clinton\u2019s statement, \u201cAnd gay rights has moved much faster than women\u2019s rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon.\u201d CNBC correspondent John Harwood, who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to Donald Trump as a primary debate moderator, effectively served as an adviser to the Clinton campaign, emailing Podesta with the subject line \u201cWatch out.\u201d The warning was regarding GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who \u201ccould give you real trouble in a general (election).\u201d Maggie Haberman, a former Politico reporter who now works for the New York Times, was described in a January 2015 memo as having \u201ca very good relationship\u201d with the Clinton campaign. \u201cWe have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed,\u201d the memo said. \\nDemeaning Catholics Podesta discussed fomenting \u201crevolution\u201d in the Catholic Church with a progressive activist while Hillary\u2019s now-communications director Jennifer Palmieri mocked Catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the Democratic Party. \u201cThere needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,\u201d Sandy Newman, president and founder of the nonprofit Voices for Progress, wrote Podesta in February 2012 . The email, among the third batch released by WikiLeaks, was titled \u201copening for a Catholic Spring? just musing.\u201d Podesta tells Newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right.\u201cWe created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this,\u201d the Clinton campaign chairman writes. \u201cBut I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.\u201d Clinton, who has accused Trump of praising Putin, called the Russian leader in a 2014 speech \u201cengaging\u201d and \u201ca very interesting conversationalist.\u201d Excerpts from Clinton\u2019s speeches were contained in a document emailed to Podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign. \\nCollusion with DOJ Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon alerted staffers that the Justice Department was proposing to publish Clinton\u2019s work-related emails, contending it showed collusion between the Obama administration and Clinton\u2019s campaign. Fallon wrote that \u201cDOJ folks\u201d told him a court hearing in the case had been planned. The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, Podesta met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. Lawyers also told the Clinton campaign in emails that Hillary\u2019s private email scandal \u201c smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I\u2019ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc .\u201d \\nEntanglements with foreign governments King Muhammad IV of Morocco made a $12 million pledge to fund the Clinton Global Initiative conference, but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker. Hillary\u2019s top aide, Huma Abedin, wrote in a January 2015 email that \u201cif HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter.\u201d Then she warned: \u201cShe created this mess and she knows it.\u201d Hillary ended up not attending but her husband Bill did. An email from Hillary Clinton\u2019s account to Podesta on Aug. 17, 2014, said Saudi Arabia and Qatar were \u201cproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to [ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.\u201d Critics have pointed out that the Clinton Foundation has received considerable funding from the two Middle East nations. In a leaked 2013 paid speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago, Hillary said Jordan and Turkey \u201ccan\u2019t possibly vet all those refugees so they don\u2019t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.\u201d Two years later she called for a 550 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. largely from United Nations refugee camps in Jordan. \\nInsider\u2019s insider had sway over DNC A WikiLeaks email dump on July 22 revealed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz used her position as head of the DNC to work in concert with the Clinton campaign to undermine the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. Schultz was forced to resign over the emails. Issues used to undermine Sanders\u2019 campaign included his faith, or lack thereof. The Clinton campaign tried to reschedule the Illinois presidential primary to lower the chances a moderate Republican would get a boost following the Super Tuesday primaries. \u201cThe Clintons won\u2019t forget what their friends have done for them,\u201d wrote Robby Mook, who later became Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, in the November 2014 email to Podesta.'"}, "time": 1742563964.892281}
