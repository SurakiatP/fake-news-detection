They claim he has shown \u201clackluster leadership\u201d in \u201cprotecting the safety\u201d of   students on campus.  The activist group spent the last month marching on campus, holding   and even protested outside of Schlissel\u2019s home \u201cin the middle of the night. \u201d \u201cOur president has blatantly ignored us and it is time for us to speak up. We have been told that our demands are \u2018rude,\u2019\u201d states a Facebook post. \u201cWe are calling on someone to care about students\u2019 concerns and to lead us with integrity and help us fight against the oppression and hateful acts that try to destroy us and our community. \u201d The Michigan Review  \u2014   an independent student news outlet that first reported Student4Justice\u2019s list of demands  \u2014   reports the group\u2019s insistence on a segregated space for students of color to launch social justice projects is raising eyebrows, given that the university has already begun construction on a $10 million center for   students in the center of campus. \u201cThe same organization that criticizes the University for failing to create \u2018an environment that engages in diversity, equity and inclusion,\u2019 is calling upon the University to undermine these ideals by facilitating a sort of de facto segregation? One where space and resources are designated for students based solely on the color of their skin?\u201d the Michigan Review reported. \u201cTo advocate for the ideals of diversity, equity and inclusion, while simultaneously calling upon the University to sanction these spaces on campus is both unprincipled and laughably regressive. \u201d Students4Justice\u2019s list of demands, the College Fix reports, insists that school administrators offer  \u201c\u2018marginalized\u201d students \u2018when oppressive attacks occur,\u2019 increasing the affirmative action of \u2018Black, Arab, and other PoC\u2019 in tenured faculty, more readily alerting students on campus of \u2018bias incidents,\u2019 and offering more financial aid for those of lower socioeconomic status. \u201d \u201cOur president has blatantly ignored us and it is time for us to speak up. We have been told that our demands are \u2018rude,\u2019\u201d states a Facebook post. \u201cWe are calling on someone to care about students\u2019 concerns and to lead us with integrity and help us fight against the oppression and hateful acts that try to destroy us and our community. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742562654.9365742}
