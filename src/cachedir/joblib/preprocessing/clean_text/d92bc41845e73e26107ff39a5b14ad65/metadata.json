Partial transcript as follows: STELTER: Were you trying to just get clicks? SMITH: I think Sean quoted me in saying it was unverified. There\u2019s obviously an attempt right now to divide the press, to turn us on each other and turn reasonable differences about editorial decisions into screaming matches between us on this show. I think that\u2019s a trap that the media has repeatedly fallen into over the last couple of years. I think it\u2019s better not to right now. STELTER: There\u2019s a tension between there\u2019s reasons to have unity and the other hand as Jake Tapper said what you did is irresponsible and that hurts us all. SMITH: I wouldn\u2019t say it was irresponsible to say we have a secret document and we\u2019re not going to share it. I would disagree with that but I think it\u2019s a reasonable thought. STELTER: It\u2019s not possible to have unity in the press corps if Buzzfeed is acting more like Wikileaks just dumping material on the internet and telling the audience to decide if it\u2019s true or not. SMITH: I think we reported a very important story  \u2014   STELTER: there\u2019s a difference between publishing and reporting. SMITH: We explained the origin of the document. we described the extent to which it was accurate and inaccurate and we shared information that was being  \u2014   by the way that not just the head of the CIA, dozens if not hundreds of journalists, intelligence officials, elected leaders were seeing and acting on. I do think when you have a document in that kind of circulation among the country\u2019s elites at the center of an incredibly heated political battle, the argument of keeping it away from the American people has to be really really strong.
