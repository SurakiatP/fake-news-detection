These mutinous senior FBI agents have enough dirt to toss Obama, Comey, Hillary and others in jail. They also loathe the idea of being subjected to Clinton in the future as they know they will be forced to perpetrate more cover-ups and stain the bureau even more. They presented Comey and Obama with a choice\u2026\u201cgive us Hillary\u2019s head on a platter and we will be silent on Obama\u2019s complicity in federal crimes [effectively a Nixon type pardon by omission of pursuit] and we will allow Comey to quietly be succeeded by a person of our choosing on an incoming Trump Administration.\u201d OR ELSE THEY WILL GO PUBLIC. Comey could have been silent until after the election no matter what they found on Weiner\u2019s laptop because they already have seen ALL the emails including the deleted ones. The fact that Comey is taking this action indicates that his hand is being forced and that he [and Obama] have accepted the terms offered by the insurrectionists in exchange for the face saving terms offered. This also dovetails with Assange saying his next batch [the FBI knows the contents of ALL of Podesta\u2019s emails] will result in the arrest of Hillary. The FBI cannot weather another PR storm revealing them complicit in a cover-up. They also must be proactive and use Hillary\u2019s arrest/indictment/forced withdrawal from the race as a lightning rod to quell a furious public by granting them their \u2018pound of flesh\u2019. No one likes Hillary, and don\u2019t think that the Pentagon is going to silently sit still as one of their 4-Star generals get ramrodded for MUCH less than Hillary did. They are aligned with the insurrectionists at the FBI. Comey and Obama\u2019s hand is being forced. Hillary is toast and going to jail. You will know this is true within a few days because the sheriff is about to slap the cuffs on Hillary. Weiner\u2019s laptop is just a cover story. Tags:'"}, "time": 1742561725.7822309}
