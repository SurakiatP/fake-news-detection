But Rosberg, who finished the race in second place, not only won the 2016 world drivers\u2019 championship, having earned 5 points more than Hamilton this year, but he also proved that he deserved that title, and above all, that it is still possible in the cutthroat world of modern Formula One to win with the style and grace of a gentleman. After conceding the drivers\u2019 title to Hamilton during the past two seasons, and even losing when they were teammates in   as children, Rosberg finally beat his nemesis. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve been racing him forever,\u201d Rosberg said of Hamilton. \u201cHe has always managed to just edge me out and get the title, even when we were small in  . He\u2019s an amazing driver and one of the best in history, so it\u2019s unbelievably special to beat him because the level is so high. \u201d It was not just the manner in which Rosberg succeeded, and his generosity in praising his teammate, but also the contrasting style with which Hamilton lost the title, that defined this final duel of the 2016 season. With just 12 points between them before the race, and Rosberg leading the series, Hamilton, who started from the pole position  \u2014   with Rosberg starting second  \u2014   had to win the race and hope that Rosberg failed to finish second or third. There was widespread speculation before the race that Hamilton would use dirty tactics by trying to hold his lead to the first corner, and then drive slowly in order to force Rosberg into a battle with the drivers who were behind him  \u2014   notably those from Red Bull and Ferrari, who started from third to sixth. \u201cThat\u2019s not really ever been my thought process,\u201d Hamilton said before the race, adding that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be very easy or wise to do so. \u201d But it was exactly what Hamilton did, driving at one point as much as nine seconds slower per lap than he had in qualifying for the pole, and despite his Mercedes engineer regularly telling him to speed up as the team feared it could lose the victory. But even before that point, Rosberg had also fallen victim early in the race to another similar tactic from a competing team, after Max Verstappen in one of the Red Bull cars moved ahead of him after his pit stop, and Verstappen slowed to block Rosberg and help the other Red Bull driver, Daniel Ricciardo, to catch up from behind Rosberg. At that point, Rosberg had to contemplate that he might end up behind both of the Red Bull drivers, with Hamilton winning the race and the title. \u201cThe feelings out there in the battle with Max, unreal,\u201d said Rosberg, looking both emotionally and physically exhausted. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t experience that many times again. \u201d He then proved what a gutsy and precise driver he is when his engineer told him that he absolutely had to pass Verstappen as soon as possible. He did so with a brilliant and brave move on Lap 20 of the   race, despite the knowledge that Verstappen has been criticized all season as a dangerous and unpredictable driver to pass. Rosberg then set several fastest laps of the race and caught up to Hamilton again, showing that he was in full control of his car and himself. But a bigger trial lay ahead in the final laps of the race: As predicted, with Rosberg less than a second behind him, Hamilton drove as slowly as he could in order to push Rosberg into Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, who was catching him, and Verstappen. Hamilton\u2019s engineer continuously requested he speed up. But Hamilton kept his car as slow as possible, even answering, for an employee of a racing team, insubordinately. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m losing the world championship,\u201d Hamilton said with two laps remaining. \u201cSo I\u2019m not bothered if I\u2019m going to lose the race. \u201d Rosberg had a card of his own to play, of course, had he decided to act like drivers such as Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Michael Schumacher in similar situations in the 1980s and 1990s, who all settled titles with knockout crashes into their own teammates. But before the race, Rosberg had said he would only do everything within the rules to win. And after the race, he said he never considered trying to pass in unrealistic circumstances. There was a certain justice that dawned after the race about Hamilton\u2019s tactic, as Vettel repeated twice that he could not have made an attempt to pass Rosberg because Hamilton was actually too close in front of Rosberg, and any leap past Rosberg might send Vettel into a collision with Hamilton\u2019s car. Under immense pressure throughout the season, Rosberg did everything he had to do to hold his advantage  \u2014   Hamilton led the series for a period of only four midseason races  \u2014   and Rosberg did so despite Hamilton\u2019s efforts, both in words and on the track, to impose his will. Paddy Lowe, the technical director of the Mercedes team, explained why he felt there was no question that Rosberg deserved to win the title. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about not just winning races, it\u2019s about sustaining that energy, sustaining that commitment, sustaining that nerve throughout a championship,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cAnd it all came down to this race today, and he did it, and that is the mark of a real world champion. \u201d But it was Rosberg\u2019s own contrasting, and worthy, behavior that impressed the most. Despite Hamilton\u2019s tactics on Sunday, and the media grilling them both over its ethical merits, Rosberg refused to say a bad word against Hamilton. \u201cYou can understand the team\u2019s perspective, and you can understand Lewis\u2019s perspective  \u2014   so that\u2019s it,\u201d said Rosberg, closing the debate. Hamilton, however, was unrepentant. \u201cI don\u2019t think what I did was dangerous, so I don\u2019t think I did anything unfair,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWe are fighting for a championship, so I controlled the pace. That\u2019s the rules. \u201d It was all a stark contrast to the early years of the series, when it was possible for one driver to hand his car to another driver of the same team, as Peter Collins did for Juan Manuel Fangio in 1956 in the final race, handing his own chance at winning his first title to Fangio, who ended up claiming his fourth. But Rosberg has perhaps learned his lessons from a driver from another age as well, as he became only the second son of a Formula One world champion  \u2014   after Graham and Damon Hill  \u2014   to win the title himself. His father, K\u00e9k\u00e9, won the title while driving for the Williams team in 1982, and after only a single victory that season. \u201cI hope my dad survived that race,\u201d Rosberg said of his victory. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him yet. I\u2019m sure it was pretty intense for him, so I hope he\u2019s O. K. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561718.9416525}
