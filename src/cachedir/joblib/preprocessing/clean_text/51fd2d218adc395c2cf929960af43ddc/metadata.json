It isn\u2019t even domestic violence. What is the leading cause of murder in Carson City? According to Sheriff Ken Furlong, it\u2019s marijuana. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s against that law,\u201d Furlong told local ABC affiliate, KOLO 8. \u201cIt does change people\u2019s attitude and we do see people dying as a result of it, needlessly, and there\u2019s no excuse for it. \\n\u201cIn the last 13-15 years, all of the violence we\u2019ve seen that has turned deadly, have [sic] been in someway related to a marijuana issue.\u201d \\nBefore you get too excited, thinking Furlong nailed it \u2014 the fact cannabis remains a federal Schedule 1 drug and thus technically illegal in the ongoing yet utterly failed war on drugs \u2014 that isn\u2019t all he had to say on the matter. \\nKOLO 8 noted the 2016 deaths of 18-year-old Grant Watkins and 40-year-old Dennis Watkins, Jr. \u2014 both killed during transactions involving the sale of cannabis. \\n\u201cDuring a transaction, they set it up, \u2018I\u2019m going to sell this to you,\u2019 then all of a sudden someone gets shot and killed,\u201d Furlong continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not because they were under the influence; it\u2019s because they were doing something deadly and it turned out that way.\u201d \\nAs Furlong explained, the threat to life isn\u2019t due to the drug\u2019s effects on the system, per se , but the \u2018culture and crimes\u2019 surrounding it \u2018that can be overwhelming,\u2019 as KOLO 8 paraphrased. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very cherished culture and people have very strong beliefs,\u201d the Sheriff elaborated. \u201cWhen you violate someone\u2019s beliefs, you put them in a position where they can act out.\u201d \\nBut Furlong\u2019s complete lack of understanding of all things cannabis \u2014 including both medicinal and recreational aspects \u2014 didn\u2019t stop there. According to the Sheriff, the community faces repercussions following a law enforcement drug bust \u2014 because addicts suddenly have no way to procure their \u2026 cannabis. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching very closely, not only for a spike in crime, but for people who are in critical need of medical care because of that lack of treatment, based on withdrawal from the drug,\u201d he asserted. \\nYes, you read that right. Carson City\u2019s Sheriff-in-charge firmly believes depriving people of cannabis \u2014 a plant scientifically and anecdotally proven to save lives \u2014 will lead to a crime wave and health crisis of no small proportions. \\nBut what he explained next, as paraphrased by KOLO 8, harkens back to the earliest days of cannabis prohibition and the propagandist classic, Reefer Madness: \\n\u2018Sheriff Furlong says unlike other drugs like heroin or methamphetamines that can distort your mind, people using marijuana usually have rational trains of thought which give them the ability to act out and become violent when someone takes away or violates their drug.\u2019 \\nAt this point, if you\u2019re having a good laugh, stunned, or shaking your head, you most certainly are not alone. \\nObviously, Sheriff Furlong grasps the potential perils in black market trade \u2014 but he wholly fails to recognize removing cannabis\u2019 illegality would thus remove the risk of violence. When the State is removed from consensual business transactions, individuals are free to conduct trade as they see fit \u2014 if cannabis were abundant and legal, it would be highly unlikely people would continue killing each other over soured deals. \\nBut Furlong\u2019s stupefying lack of knowledge concerning the effects cannabis has on the body, though certainly laughable, also should concern the residents he\u2019s tasked with overseeing. \\nMischaracterizing cannabis so broadly as to believe it will warp people\u2019s minds to a heightened frenzy where they\u2019re likely to commit violence is downright dangerous. \\nFor one thing, this inexcusable misperception could color the training Sheriff Furlong decides to give law enforcement trainees and officers. Considering the absolutely epidemic national spate of violence inflicted by trigger-happy cops who already seem to have an irrational fear of the public, training them to further view cannabis users as likely to act out physically is nothing short of dangerous. \\nIf sheriff\u2019s deputies conduct a raid on a residence known for cannabis transactions with the preconception the people inside could turn violent instantly, it\u2019s arguable they would be more likely to misinterpret anything they encounter. This unnecessarily heightened fear that their life could be in peril from a cannabis-crazed maniac would have obvious influence on their decisions for whether or not to employ deadly force. \\nSadly, Sheriff Furlong likely isn\u2019t alone among law enforcement in the United States. As long as the drug war remains firmly entrenched in policy and culture, dangerous misunderstandings and lack of knowledge will arguably be the greater source of violence than would the substances be were they not illegal. \\nIn the meantime, while forced to pick apart drug laws state by state, perhaps drug and cannabis education \u2014 not fear- and prohibition-based propaganda, but serious education \u2014 should be mandatory in law enforcement training. Share Google + Lannim \\nAll he did, without knowing it, was admit that the real criminals are the ones who enforce prohibition and create this culture of violence. When you suppress a legitimate market it will be replaced by a black market that is regulated by force instead of voluntary interaction. Violence begets violence, and it doesn\u2019t get any more violent than the state. ACAB Matt Agorist \\nEXACTLY! James Michael \\nConsidering the government never created a constitutional amendment allowing prohibition the entire drug war is treason and felonius\u2026. EVERY killing a murder\u2026. EVERY raid a felony home invasion\u2026. EVERY jailing a false imprisonment\u2026. EVERY fine extortion\u2026\u2026 The cops and the courts are a criminal enterprise\u2026. AKA RICO\u2026.. and meet the definition of it perfectly\u2026. Lannim \\nExactly. I would say that the drug war would be just as illegitimate and criminal with an amendment, but being able to argue that it\u2019s ALSO unconstitutional helps, considering most Americans think their rights are contingent upon what\u2019s written on sacred documents. b4integrity \\nThe federal government is a continuing, criminal, domestic, terrorist enterprise. \\nWe need a DEA eradication program. Paschn \\nGoddamn it does my old heart good to see folks lay things out as you did! Couple that with SCOTUS\u2019 treason with corporate citizenship, Patriot act, Habeas corpus gone, Posse Comitatus, gone granting civil immunity to big pharma, setting up a federal committee to \u201creview\u201d claims made by citizens harmed by \u201csafe\u201d vaccines, then paying off those claims WITH TAX PAYER MONEY to protect the bottom line of the elites\u2026. Murdering Ranchers for pointing out the FED\u2019s treason.. Let us not forget the 2 sets of books most governments run (CAFR). Let me know when you folks have had enough SEWER NATION \u2013 IDIOT CULTURE. Centrist Force \\nThis is easy to solve. end the criminal part of this. There is no need for marijuana to be illegal. You want to end drug deals and guns get the cops out of the equation and nobody needs to play this mob games. Gregory Pius \\nWe did that in Oregon and Washington. Tax revenues are bursting the state coffers, and the police now have to find honest work (or at least overzealously enforce something else). Everybody wins. Sadly, almost all LEOs I\u2019ve ever heard to talked to have a deeply-held conviction that legalization of cannabis will result in the loss of their job. A \u2026 kaynash \\nWe have far too many ignorant people in positions of power\u2026..of course our press doesn\u2019t help either, they are just as ignorant, so no one is getting educated from that source any longer. But really, a Sheriff? If you are going to criminalize people, you should have a much better understanding of what you are saying. Because thinking people in law enforcement are more than aware that it\u2019s criminalizing drugs that is the problem\u2026.and this guy actually comes close to realizing that and then draws the totally wrong conclusions from it. dufas_duck \\n\u201cWhen you violate someone\u2019s beliefs, you put them in a position where they can act out.\u201d \\nSounds like he described the average policeman\u2026\u2026..
