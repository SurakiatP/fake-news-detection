Amid the swirl, a petite freshman named Jasmin Hernandez lost sight of her friends. Then Tevin Elliott, a    Baylor football player dating someone she knew, appeared. Earlier he had been pouring hard liquor for Ms. Hernandez and other underage students now he was insisting that her friends had gone outside. When Ms. Hernandez expressed doubts, she said, he began pulling her by the wrist toward the door, telling her they had gone outside. But the farther they strayed into the darkness, the more she argued that her friends were back at the party, and that they should return. Without a word, she later said in a lawsuit, the      linebacker picked up the   freshman and made his violent intentions clear. Panicking, Ms. Hernandez told him that she was sorry if she gave him the wrong impression that they should just go back to the house and forget this ever happened that she was, in fact, gay. He acted as though he did not hear. When Mr. Elliott finished raping her behind a secluded shed, an angry Ms. Hernandez used an expletive in demanding her shirt back. \u201cHe tossed it over to me,\u201d she later recalled. \u201cAnd that was the end of the interaction. \u201d Ms. Hernandez, who has appeared on ESPN and who spoke to The Times for this article, assumed that her rape was a horrible but isolated incident at Baylor, a private university of nearly 17, 000 students that takes pride in its Baptist foundation. And she wasn\u2019t alone in believing that: Even after Mr. Elliott was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in 2014, Baylor officials said they considered him to be a solitary bad actor preying on a campus of goodness. As three leading members of Baylor\u2019s Board of Regents later described their sense of him at the time: \u201can isolated case. \u201d Mr. Elliott has subsequently been accused of sexually assaulting several other women, and since the rape of Ms. Hernandez in 2012 the allegations of sexual assault by Baylor football players have multiplied, causing incalculable damage to the university\u2019s reputation and leading to resignations and firings, including those of the president, the football coach and the athletic director. The crisis has left alumni apoplectic, students outraged, donors turning on one another, and the Board of Regents bracing for the next blow. Lawsuits clutter the courts, with more than a dozen women, including Ms. Hernandez, claiming that they had been assaulted amid a campus culture that put them at risk. Two months ago, John Clune, a Colorado lawyer who specializes in cases of campus assault and who had already resolved three other women\u2019s claims against Baylor, filed a lawsuit on behalf of an alleged victim that sought, in part, to quantify the crisis. It made the startling claim that at least 52 rapes by at least 31 players had occurred from 2011 through 2014  \u2014   a period when the   Baylor football program became a dominant force in the highly competitive Big 12 Conference. Baylor\u2019s interim president has said in a statement that he cannot confirm Mr. Clune\u2019s numbers, which followed other troubling figures that Baylor\u2019s board gave to The Wall Street Journal in October: assaults on 17 women by 19 players, including four gang rapes. Collectively, the cases have become a cautionary parable for   college athletics, one in which a Christian university seemed to lose sight of its core values in pursuit of football glory and protected gridiron heroes who preyed on women. In a statement to The New York Times on Monday, Baylor officials said the university was committed to \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d  \u2014   through   repeated apologies and making 105 recommended changes to its policies and structure. \u201cOur mission statement calls for a caring community based on Christian principles, and any act of sexual violence is inimical to these standards,\u201d the statement said. Even so, the scandal has not sat well in Texas. Last week, the Texas Rangers, the statewide law enforcement agency, confirmed that it had begun a preliminary investigation into Baylor. That announcement came days after a state representative, Roland Gutierrez of San Antonio, filed a resolution urging Gov. Greg Abbott to have the Rangers investigate \u201cthe obstruction of justice surrounding the sexual assault of young female students at Baylor University. \u201d And this week, a federal judge rejected Baylor\u2019s request to throw out a lawsuit filed against the university by 10 women who say they were sexually assaulted while they were students. Judge Robert L. Pitman of Federal District Court ruled that each plaintiff had \u201cplausibly alleged that Baylor was deliberately indifferent to her report( s) of sexual assault, depriving her of educational opportunities to which she was entitled. \u201d For most of her freshman year, Ms. Hernandez was passionate about the Baylor green and gold. A native of Southern California, she came to the university\u2019s verdant campus in Waco to study nursing on an academic scholarship. She loved her teachers and friends, and enjoyed cheering on the ascendant football team  \u2014   a sudden powerhouse, thanks in part to the likes of her future attacker, Mr. Elliott. She arrived at a time of athletic excellence so bountiful that the   school year came to be known as the Year of the Bear. The football team had its first Heisman Trophy winner in the quarterback Robert Griffin III the men\u2019s basketball team reached the N. C. A. A. tournament\u2019s round of eight for the second time in three years and the women\u2019s team went   for the national championship. This run of success was all the more extraordinary for what had come before: decades of mediocrity in major sports, with the lows far outnumbering the highs. Then, before the 2008 season, the university hired Art Briles as its football coach. And things changed. Mr. Briles was Texas to the core  \u2014   a quarterback for his father at Rule High School, a wide receiver at the University of Houston and a coach at five Texas high schools before he entered the college ranks. Along the way, he devised an explosive offensive system that seemed to attack the end zone on every snap. He inherited a Baylor program that had not had a winning season since 1995. What\u2019s more, schools like Baylor, then a   choice for top recruits in one of the country\u2019s most   states, rarely experience quick turnarounds. But the new coach pulled it off by his third year, the Bears were winning more than they lost. The university and its alumni responded, reportedly paying the charismatic Mr. Briles one of the highest salaries in college sports and embarking upon a   campaign that led to the $266 million construction of McLane Stadium  \u2014   a breathtaking football cathedral that abuts the Brazos River and Interstate 35. Just before the 2014 season, Mr. Briles marveled at the visual and emotional power of the stadium, saying, \u201cShow me something better. \u201d Mr. Briles imagined the impression the sight would leave on an    child looking out the window of a passing car. \u201cThey\u2019re going to say, \u2018Momma or Grandmother, man, look at that place,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018That place is beautiful. Where is that?\u2019 And she\u2019s going to say, \u2018Baylor.\u2019 \u201cAnd then so for the rest of their lives they\u2019re going to associate Baylor with excellence. And that\u2019s hard to come by and the only way to get it is through the production of image. \u201cSo our image is good. \u201d The promise of McLane  \u2014   named after Drayton McLane Jr. Class of \u201958, who made his fortune with a   business  \u2014   helped stimulate capital campaigns that focused on a new scholarship fund and a new campus for the business school. \u201cSuccess in athletics means that all boats rise,\u201d Kenneth W. Starr, then the university\u2019s president, told The Times in 2014. Mr. Starr had arrived at Baylor in 2010 with a formidable r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and a clear vision. A former solicitor general, federal judge, law school dean and independent counsel  \u2014   the Javert in the President Bill Clinton sex scandal  \u2014   he promised an administrative stability that the university had lacked in recent years. He raised Baylor\u2019s academic profile and presided over ambitious   efforts, all while endearing himself to undergraduates. He was the avuncular \u201cJudge Starr,\u201d leading freshmen on a pregame sprint across the field to invigorate the crowd at each home game. The dynamic pairing of Mr. Starr and Mr. Briles signaled to students and alumni alike that, with the twinning of their respective strengths, Baylor was going places. Along the way, the university\u2019s football players appeared on giant posters, on computer screen savers  \u2014   just about anywhere you looked on campus. A    bronze statue of Mr. Griffin, midthrow, greeted visitors to McLane Stadium when it opened in 2014. The message was clear: Our heroes. But myriad court cases suggest that as the boats of Baylor rose, to use Mr. Starr\u2019s analogy, standards fell overboard. Baylor and its football program, it seemed, began to value   talent above all else. Baylor\u2019s football team signed up transfers with disciplinary issues in their pasts. There was Shawn Oakman, for example, a huge defensive end dismissed from Penn State\u2019s team for stealing a sandwich and grabbing a female store clerk by the wrist. And Sam Ukwuachu, a former Freshman   defensive end kicked off Boise State\u2019s team for reasons that were left publicly unclear at the time his   later testified that he had assaulted her. (Mr. Briles has said that he was unaware of the assault accusation.) According to the lawsuit filed by Mr. Clune, the lawyer from Colorado, the football staff at the Baptist institution employed a \u201c\u2018Show em a good time\u2019 policy,\u201d in which current players offered alcohol and drugs to high school prospects visiting the campus and introduced them to female students. The lawsuit also alleged that the university unofficially used its hostess program, the Baylor Bruins, to further entice recruits. It said that \u201cattractive female students\u201d in the Bruins were expected to ensure that recruits had a good time on campus by, for example, engaging \u201cin sexual acts with the recruits to help secure the recruits\u2019 commitment to Baylor. \u201d The university\u2019s interim president, David E. Garland, has called these allegations \u201cdisappointing and horrifying,\u201d and has said that \u201cnone of the activities described in the filing align with our past or current institutional recruiting practices. \u201d A particularly notorious allegation in the lawsuit is that Kendal Briles, a former assistant coach and Art Briles\u2019s son, enticed one recruit by saying: \u201cDo you like white women? Because we have a lot of them at Baylor and they LOVE football players. \u201d The younger Mr. Briles declined to comment through a spokeswoman for his current employer, Florida Atlantic University. As for the assault accusations, Baylor\u2019s Board of Regents later concluded that the football program\u2019s coaches and staff \u201creinforced an overall perception that football was above the rules, and that there was no culture of accountability for misconduct. \u201d Baylor, they wrote, \u201cfailed to take sufficient action to identify, eliminate, prevent and address a potential hostile environment in individual cases. \u201d As Jasmin Hernandez would learn. Visiting the Baylor campus in the spring of 2011, Ms. Hernandez found the thrill of a rising university to be contagious. Everyone \u201cseemed really excited to be there,\u201d she recalled, the sense being \u201cIf you go here, there are good things ahead. \u201d Nothing embodied that excitement as much as the football team. Ms. Hernandez attended several games her freshman year, and participated in some   rituals, such as wearing a football jersey with the number of her graduation year and cheering on the players and coaches as they took the field. \u201cReally cool,\u201d she recalled. But after Ms. Hernandez was raped, she would allege in a lawsuit filed last year, she encountered an indifference on campus  \u2014   even a callousness  \u2014   that baffled and wounded her. Her friends at the party immediately took her to a nearby hospital, where she recounted the assault for a Waco police officer. Her worried mother arrived from California and, almost immediately, asked the university\u2019s counseling center to provide her daughter with mental health services. But, the lawsuit claimed, the counseling center was too busy to see her daughter  \u2014   and so was the student health center. \u201cI went in, told them I\u2019d been sexually assaulted by another student, and asked if there was someone I could talk to, like a medical doctor,\u201d Ms. Hernandez said. \u201cThey told me all their appointments through the end of the semester were taken. I went back several times. Every time they denied me  \u2014   told me there was nothing they could do. \u201d The academic services department also said there was nothing it could do, the lawsuit claimed. No accommodations could be granted, the Hernandezes were told. According to the lawsuit, Ms. Hernandez\u2019s mother reached out to Mr. Briles and was told by his secretary that his office had heard of the alleged rape by one of his budding stars and was looking into it. But Mr. Briles did not return several   calls from Ms. Hernandez\u2019s father, the lawsuit claimed, adding that the university \u201cdid not take any action whatsoever to investigate. \u201d Baylor has disputed Ms. Hernandez\u2019s narrative in a court filing, but it did not respond to questions seeking elaboration. University officials have said in another court filing that Ms. Hernandez was Mr. Elliott\u2019s fifth alleged assault victim at Baylor  \u2014   her lawsuit said she was the sixth who had reported a sexual assault to Baylor  \u2014   and that Mr. Briles was indeed apprised of her alleged assault. In addition, they said, only extraordinary interventions by Mr. Starr and Mr. Briles kept Mr. Elliott from suspension or worse because of academic misconduct. Mr. Briles, in a written statement released last week, said that he \u201cdid not cover up any sexual violence\u201d and \u201chad no contact with anyone that claimed to be a victim of sexual or domestic assault,\u201d and that whenever alerted of an alleged assault, he would send the clear message that \u201cthe alleged victim should go to the police. \u201d All the while, Ms. Hernandez was determined to follow through with her Baylor career. But she could not. \u201cI was extremely emotionally unstable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t live my daily life, because I could, but it was very interrupted by turbulent emotions that I couldn\u2019t exactly predict and that I didn\u2019t know how to deal with. \u201d After posting poor grades during the   school year  \u2014   a decline that she attributed to her trauma  \u2014   Ms. Hernandez was informed by Baylor that she had lost her academic scholarship. She dropped out of the school she once loved, returned to California and began therapy. That fall, the Baylor Bears were   and won the Big 12. In early 2014, Mr. Elliott was convicted of sexually assaulting her and sentenced to 20 years in prison. That fall, the Bears were again   and shared the Big 12 championship with Texas Christian. Baylor was moving on. The first clear signal that the Elliott case was more than a Baylor aberration came in the late summer of 2015  \u2014   two years after a damaged Ms. Hernandez quietly dropped out  \u2014   when Texas Monthly published a disturbing account of the alleged rape of another Baylor woman by another football player: the troubled transfer from Boise State, Sam Ukwuachu. This episode was said to have occurred nearly two years earlier, in October 2013, while Mr. Ukwuachu was sitting out the football season as a   transfer student. According to Texas Monthly, Baylor officials had conducted only a cursory investigation in deciding not to pursue the sexual assault claim against Mr. Ukwuachu, who was eventually convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years\u2019 probation. Testimony in the case against the      Mr. Ukwuachu was devastating. \u201cHe was using all of his strength to pull up my dress and do stuff to me,\u201d said the victim. Baylor\u2019s president, Mr. Starr, promptly issued a letter addressed to \u201cBaylor Nation. \u201d It began: \u201cBy God\u2019s grace, we are living in a golden era at Baylor University. However, today we are filled with profound sadness. \u201d He expressed grief for the victim, asserted that those who engage in sexual violence would \u201cfind no shelter\u201d on campus, and announced that a faculty member with prosecutorial experience would investigate the circumstances of the Ukwuachu case. That professor\u2019s weeklong inquiry convinced Mr. Starr of the need for a more comprehensive investigation. The Board of Regents soon hired Pepper Hamilton, a Philadelphia law firm with experience in investigating potential violations of Title IX, the federal law mandating gender equity in higher education. Pepper Hamilton\u2019s inquiry lasted several months. The complete results of its investigation, which included interviews with central figures and access to a million pieces of information, have never been made public  \u2014   because, the university said, they were delivered orally to the Board of Regents. Releasing all of them in written form, several regents later said, would have taken an additional six months. University officials have said they limited public information in deference to federal privacy law, confidentiality agreements and victims\u2019 presumed feelings. But critics say that asking only for an oral report is a standard tactic for avoiding full accountability. The board\u2019s public summary of that Pepper Hamilton briefing, in May 2016, was still damning. In a   report, the board excoriated its own institution  \u2014   and itself  \u2014   for failing to adhere to a federal requirement that victims of campus sexual assault receive a \u201cprompt and equitable response\u201d from their college. In one instance, it reported, a student was retaliated against for reporting an assault other students, it added, may have feared being stigmatized for reporting assaults that involved underage drinking or premarital sex. Investigations, they wrote, \u201cwere conducted in the context of a broader culture and belief by many administrators that sexual violence \u2018doesn\u2019t happen here. \u2019\u201d Most of the report addressed the entire university  \u2014   though a few pages near the end focused squarely on the football program. Football officials, it charged, had set up a parallel justice system for their players, did not properly report complaints to the rest of the university and in some cases tried to keep law enforcement authorities out. Mr. Briles, the revered coach who had led Baylor to gridiron glory, was effectively fired. Mr. Starr, the affable president who reveled in that glory, was demoted he later resigned. Ian McCaw, the athletic director, was placed on probation with sanctions by the university for mishandling sexual assault allegations he, too, later resigned, and now holds the same position at Liberty University. The board also vowed institutional changes. And it apologized to Baylor Nation. \u201cWe were horrified by the extent of these acts of sexual violence on our campus,\u201d Richard S. Willis, then chairman of the Board of Regents, said. \u201cThis investigation revealed the university\u2019s mishandling of reports in what should have been a supportive, responsive and caring environment for students. \u201d The board\u2019s confessional housecleaning may have been intended, at least in part, to begin putting this episode in the past. Instead, the scandal has continued to define  \u2014   or redefine  \u2014   Baylor. Other women have followed the lead of Ms. Hernandez, filing lawsuits claiming sexual assault by Baylor students, athletes and  . One recounts the alleged gang rape of a young Bruins hostess by two football players, one of whom supposedly tried to \u201cstare down\u201d a worried young man who had dared to interrupt the moment. Implicated football players have left or been expelled. Mr. Oakman, the     defensive end who had transferred to Baylor from Penn State, became at least the third former player to be indicted on sexual assault charges. His criminal case, in which he has pleaded not guilty, is pending. Some changes have come. Outsiders have taken over as football coach and athletic director, and a search committee is engaged in finding a permanent president. A few of the 105 recommendations concern the board itself, a structurally insular institution whose voting members are primarily determined by current membership. In addition, the Big 12 took the rare, if largely symbolic, step of withholding a quarter of Baylor\u2019s payouts  \u2014   about $6 million this year, according to The Associated Press, and more in years to come  \u2014   until promised changes are actually made and, as the Big 12 board chairman said in a statement, \u201csystems are in place to avoid future problems. \u201d In its statement to The Times, Baylor said: \u201cThere should be no doubt that, rather than worrying about its \u2018brand,\u2019 Baylor leadership has been focused on doing the right thing. \u201d The university went on to say that its efforts to address and repair the damage done far surpass those taken by any other educational institution. \u201cNo other college or university has, at its own initiative, undergone such a thorough \u201d it said. \u201cNo other college or university has made such wholesale leadership changes based on that  . No other college or university has eagerly embraced an ambitious slate of 105 recommended changes. And, despite the accusations of some, no other university has been as transparent about its failings. \u201d But some critics say that the university should not be so quick to flatter itself  \u2014   pointing out that, among other things, it was slow to make a clean break from the Briles era. Although it hired an acting football coach last year, it retained nearly all of Mr. Briles\u2019s staff, including his son and   . These Briles loyalists made known their continued allegiance to those accused of presiding over a football culture in which sexual violence seemed to thrive. The university has also been criticized for not being fully forthcoming about the scandal. A group of alumni and donors, Bears for Leadership Reform, has demanded full transparency, beginning with the release of all material related to the Pepper Hamilton briefing. Its members include Mr. McLane, after whom the football stadium is named. Last month, the reform group called on the university to reveal how much it was paying in legal fees to have recommendations from the Pepper Hamilton report carried out. The group estimated that the scandal had cost Baylor $223 million in expenses such as legal fees and settlements as well as in lost revenue from projected contributions. The developments are so numerous and the media attention so intense that Baylor\u2019s website has a page called, simply, \u201cThe Facts\u201d  \u2014   as in \u201cThe Facts About the Sexual Assault Crisis at Baylor. \u201d Here you can find links to \u201cLatest Updates,\u201d \u201cUniversity Improvements\u201d and \u201cSetting the Record Straight. \u201d The \u201cFacts\u201d page reflects how Baylor\u2019s embattled Board of Regents, after months of silence, has adopted a new public relations strategy that is less opaque and more aggressive in a bid, officials acknowledged, to make the public narrative accurate. For example, in responding to a lawsuit filed by a dismissed football staff member, university officials recently released text messages that seem to demonstrate how Mr. Briles sought to cover up various misdeeds by some of his players. Those text messages presumably came from the trove of information accumulated by the Pepper Hamilton investigation  \u2014   the very information that reformers and others are demanding be made public without prejudice. Mr. Briles sued for defamation  \u2014   he dropped the suit just before the text messages were released  \u2014   accusing Baylor of making a \u201cscapegoat\u201d of him, perhaps to make a case that the problem had been solved, like a limb amputated before gangrene has spread. University officials replied in a court filing that Mr. Briles was \u201cnot a \u2018scapegoat\u2019\u201d but \u201cpart of the larger problem. \u201d Several donors asked last June that Mr. Briles, 61, be reinstated or at most suspended unless the Regents could offer more evidence of his complicity, which the regents declined to do at the time, university officials said in a court filing. After Mr. Briles\u2019s text messages were released, Bears for Leadership Reform said it was \u201cappalled. \u201d Then there are the likes of John Eddie Williams Jr.: a member of the Class of 1976, a former nose guard for the Baylor football team, a successful Houston lawyer and a benefactor so generous that the field at McLane Stadium was named after him. He is also a member of Bears for Leadership Reform, and he is furious at what he said was the university\u2019s mismanagement of this crisis  \u2014   including its lack of transparency. \u201cWhen you have horrible events like occurred at Baylor, you need to have transparency, and that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll move forward,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cLet the word come out. Let it come out, the good, the bad, the ugly. Put it all on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s how we learn from our mistakes and move forward. \u201d The steady stream of revelations would seem only to have helped the case of Jasmin Hernandez, who, in pressing charges against her rapist, struck the first powerful blow against Baylor\u2019s disturbing culture. This week, her lawyer secured court permission to incorporate new information into her lawsuit  \u2014   including the allegation of 52 sexual assaults by at least 31 players over four years. (A prime defense cited by the defendants in her case  \u2014   Mr. Briles, Mr. McCaw and Baylor  \u2014   is that her claims are   by a   statute of limitations.) She is now a junior at California State University, Fullerton. And, yes, she remembers some of the good experiences she had at Baylor: the supportive friends, the passionate teachers, the many engaging activities. But Ms. Hernandez said that the Baptist university in Waco simply was not ethical when dealing with allegations of sexual assaults by its revered football players  \u2014   or, for that matter, when dealing with the traumatized victims of those sexual assaults. As new revelations have come out, she said, she has been \u201cshocked\u201d  \u2014   yet, at the same time, \u201cnot surprised. \u201d She does not closely follow the many news accounts of the continuing scandal, especially those that concern her case. \u201cI don\u2019t care to see myself through that light,\u201d said Ms. Hernandez, once a scholarship member of Baylor University\u2019s Class of 2015.'"}, "time": 1742628533.764037}
