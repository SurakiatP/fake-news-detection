Otherwise, we\u2019d probably find our editor Paul Dacre being reported to himself in his other role at the Press Complaints Commission. That wouldn\u2019t be good for anyone. \\n\u201cBut now it\u2019s bloody well confirmed she\u2019s definitely going out with him, and.. well\u2026 oh hear, I\u2019m coming over all faint again. \\n\u201cDo you realise that any child they might have would be 6th in line to the throne?! Can you imagine, a BROWN king!!\u201d \\nAt that point the doctors asked us to leave so they could administer an emergency sedative. '"}, "time": 1742628406.3365192}
