Would his stream of insults hurt viewership of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d or sales of Ivanka Trump shoes? Or was all the attention good for business, a marketing adage President Trump could have learned during his time as a reality television star. The answer may surprise him. Major companies appear to be   their relationships with the Trump brand, which, in some instances, does not appear to have benefited from Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Hinting at lackluster sales, Neiman Marcus confirmed on Friday that it had dropped Ivanka Trump\u2019s jewelry line from its website. A day earlier, her brand had disappeared from Nordstrom. com, a move  reported by the fashion news site Racked. Not everyone was happy that retailers were distancing themselves from the Trump name. By Saturday, some Twitter users were posting #BoycottNordstrom. Companies also seem worried about how protests over the president\u2019s actions, particularly his recent executive order on immigration, could hurt sales. On Friday, MillerCoors, a brewing company, contacted Shannon Coulter, a founder of GrabYourWallet. org, a campaign pushing for boycotts of Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and other businesses associated with the Trump name. \u201cHe wanted to talk about why they were on the list,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI think all the companies are paying close attention. \u201d At a time when protests and boycotts can easily be organized online, brands face more pressure to respond to consumer demands. Chris Allieri, a marketing consultant with Mulberry  Astor, said, \u201cBefore he became president, I think that a lot of consumers were indifferent to the Trump brand. \u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder for people to ignore the connection. \u201d The MillerCoors name appeared on GrabYourWallet. org after Peter Coors, a board member of its parent company, Molson Coors, lent his name to a   for Mr. Trump in June. MillerCoors said it did not support candidates in presidential races but respected the rights of its workers to do so. \u201cBoycotting our brands only harms   employees and their families and is counter to the positive progress that we should all be encouraging and delivering at a time when our nation seems so divided,\u201d Marty Maloney, a spokesman, said. Mr. Trump and his daughter have stepped away from executive roles at the Trump Organization, which still earns money from golf courses, hotels and other properties around the world. (Ms. Trump has also stepped away as head of her brand.) Because Mr. Trump\u2019s company is privately held, it is hard to know what impact his presidency has had on his businesses. But the merchandise side of the Trump licensing empire may be more vulnerable to negative attention. \u201cRetailers around the country are going to say, do we need the aggravation or not,\u201d said Wendy Liebmann, chief executive at WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that if a brand is really, really doing well, a retailer like a Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus would cut off their nose to spite their face. \u201d Rosemary K. Young, senior director of marketing for Ms. Trump\u2019s brand, said in a statement that the company keep expanding and that it had \u201csignificant\u201d    revenue growth in 2016. Representatives for Macy\u2019s, which sells Ms. Trump\u2019s clothing, handbags and shoes, did not respond to requests for comment. The retailer dropped Mr. Trump\u2019s clothing line early in his campaign after he called Mexican immigrants \u201ckillers\u201d and \u201crapists. \u201d Companies have also faced pressure to back away from \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d franchise, of which Mr. Trump is an executive producer. Kawasaki said last month that it would pull its sponsorship, though the Japanese company seemed to backtrack somewhat within hours. Ms. Coulter said the Honest Company, whose products will appear in an episode of \u201cThe New Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d had committed not to advertise for the rest of the season or next year. The brand confirmed that it had limited involvement with the show, which has not yet been renewed for 2018. In addition to possibly repelling some advertisers, Mr. Trump\u2019s association with the show does not appear to have helped viewership much. On Thursday, he asked people  \u2014   perhaps jokingly  \u2014   to pray for the company\u2019s ratings at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Mr. Allieri, who backed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, said, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a good opportunity to advertise, I would look beyond \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 because there\u2019s not going to be an upside. \u201d As the Trump name became politicized so have brands associated with it. Just days after #DeleteUber began trending on Twitter  \u2014   a response to criticism that the   app had undercut protests of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order  \u2014   Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, resigned from a presidential economic advisory council. Nordstrom, which mainly sold Ivanka Trump shoes, said demand for Ms. Trump\u2019s products had not been strong. The company still has some merchandise from previous orders that it plans to sell in stores. For the time being, the relationship appears to have ended. Neiman Marcus said it \u201ccontinuously\u201d assesses productivity to determine where its products are sold. Some jewelry will still be available in the stores. After apparel, Ms. Trump\u2019s shoes account for the largest portion of her company\u2019s revenue. Three years ago, the brand predicted that shoe sales would reach $35 million last year at wholesale, generating $2 million in royalty fees, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. Jewelry was predicted to reach $7. 5 million, or $300, 000 in fees. At the time, Ms. Trump seemed to be having more trouble with Mondani, which makes her handbags. \u201cWe think the handbags are terrible,\u201d the documents said. \u201cThey don\u2019t. \u201d A spokesman for Ms. Trump\u2019s brand said, \u201cWe are fortunate to have dedicated and engaged partners on our handbags and all of our product categories. \u201d Representatives for Mondani did not respond to requests for comment.'"}, "time": 1742628469.1014447}
