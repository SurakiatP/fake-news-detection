DeMille Award. \u2022 Casey Affleck, Viola Davis, Isabelle Huppert and Tracee Ellis Ross also won awards. Here is a list of the winners. \u2022 And in TV categories, \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cAtlanta\u201d were triumphant. \u2022 Wesley Morris, Melena Ryzik and Dave Itzkoff provided   commentary. And The Times was also on the red carpet. The     \u201cLa La Land\u201d dominated the 74th Golden Globes on Sunday, receiving a promotional boost in the form of a lavish tribute that kicked off the awards telecast and collecting a record seven prizes, including one for best comedy or musical. No film has won more than four Globes since 1979, when the crime drama \u201cMidnight Express\u201d received six, the previous   number. \u201cI\u2019m in a daze now officially,\u201d said the force behind \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Damien Chazelle, 31, as he accepted the directing award. Noting the \u201cLa La Land\u201d plot  \u2014     dreamers try to make it in show business  \u2014   Emma Stone said in accepting the award for best actress in a musical or comedy, \u201cI think that hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world, and that\u2019s what this movie is about. \u201d \u201cLa La Land,\u201d made by Lionsgate, also won Globes for song, score, screenplay and actor. The bliss felt by the \u201cLa La Land\u201d cast and crew was likely mirrored by the disappointment of those involved with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d the night\u2019s    film. Despite six nominations, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d about a young black man growing up in Miami, received a lone trophy  \u2014   albeit an important one: best drama. \u201cPlease, tell a friend, tell a friend, tell a friend,\u201d Barry Jenkins, the director of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d said in accepting the award, trying to boost the art film\u2019s box office performance. A year after Hollywood was excoriated for its lack of diversity at the Oscars, inclusion was a major theme on Sunday. \u201cThis is for all of the women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy,\u201d said Tracee Ellis Ross, as she accepted the best television actress Globe for her role in the ABC series \u201c . \u201d \u201cI want you to know that I see you. We see you. \u201d Ms. Ross was the first black woman to win in the category since 1983, when Debbie Allen won for \u201cFame. \u201d There were several surprises. Isabelle Huppert took best actress in a drama for the French film \u201cElle,\u201d beating Natalie Portman, who was favored to win for \u201cJackie. \u201d (\u201cElle,\u201d a thriller about a businesswoman who tracks her rapist, also won best foreign film.) The foreign journalists who bestow the Globes are known for spreading their awards far and wide, but several films received nothing, including \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins,\u201d \u201cLion,\u201d \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d and \u201cHell or High Water. \u201d \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d despite five nominations, was honored only in the best actor category for Casey Affleck. HBO, despite 14 nominations, the most of any network, was shut out altogether. The first award of the night, for best supporting actor, dropped jaws: Aaron   won for his performance in Tom Ford\u2019s   \u201cNocturnal Animals,\u201d beating favorites like Mahershala Ali of \u201cMoonlight. \u201d \u201cI made it  \u2014   thank you,\u201d Mr.   said, looking a bit startled. To the surprise of almost no one, Viola Davis took the supporting actress prize for playing a 1950s homemaker in \u201cFences. \u201d After doling out two kisses, one to her husband and one to Denzel Washington, who directed \u201cFences\u201d and stars in it, Ms. Davis thanked its producers for taking a risk on the film. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t scream moneymaker,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it does scream art. It does scream heart. \u201d Early television awards were widely distributed. The   FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d about an aspiring rapper and his manager cousin, was honored as best comedy and Donald Glover won for best comedic actor for his performance in the show. Beating the likes of Rami Malek (\u201cMr. Robot\u201d) and Bob Odenkirk (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d) for best actor in a drama was Billy Bob Thornton, honored for his performance in \u201cGoliath,\u201d a show with little buzz. Best actress in a TV drama went to Claire Foy, who plays a young Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown,\u201d which won for best dramatic series. As expected, \u201cThe People vs. O. J. Simpson: Crime Story\u201d was named best   and Sarah Paulson, repeating her win at the Emmys, collected a trophy for her portrayal of the prosecutor Marcia Clark in that show. A   Ms. Paulson was showered with hugs from   as she returned to her seat. The night got off to a jerky start. After the host, Jimmy Fallon, opened the show with the taped \u201cLa La Land\u201d  number, he became befuddled after a teleprompter malfunction. Still, he kept it breezy. \u201cLet\u2019s make tonight a celebration,\u201d Mr. Fallon said in his monologue. Despite promises in preshow interviews to zing Donald J. Trump ahead of his inauguration, Mr. Fallon even kept his political jokes to a minimum. \u201cOne of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote,\u201d he said, almost in a mumble. For casual movie fans, the annual Oscar race starts with the Globes. (Oscar nomination ballots are due on Friday.) But the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the Globes, has worked in recent years to make its television honors more relevant by leaning toward rookie shows like \u201cThe Affair\u201d and \u201cTransparent. \u201d Hollywood stylists spent most of the week fretting about the weather forecast. For days, it looked like torrential rain would threaten a repeat of the 2010 Globes ceremony, when the red carpet turned into a swamp. On Sunday, however, Angelenos awakened to \u201canother day of sun,\u201d to borrow a lyric from \u201cLa La Land. \u201d When Meryl Streep, a   Globes nominee and   winner, accepted her Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, she gave an impassioned speech that, while never mentioning Mr. Trump by name, was a clear reaction to the election. \u201cTake your broken heart, make it into art,\u201d she said, quoting Carrie Fisher. Mr. Trump, in a brief telephone interview, said that he had not watched the Globes or Ms. Streep\u2019s speech, but that he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d that she and some other entertainment figures had criticized him during the Hollywood event. \u201cMeryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep\u2019s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of Mrs. Clinton. While winners steered away from directly criticizing Mr. Trump, several used their moment onstage to take clear jabs. The British actor Hugh Laurie, collecting a   actor award for \u201cThe Night Manager,\u201d said: \u201cI can say I won this at the   Golden Globes. I mean, it has the words \u2018Hollywood,\u2019 \u201cForeign\u2019 and \u2018Press\u2019 in it. \u201d He added, \u201cI also think to some Republicans, even the word \u2018Association\u2019 is sketchy. \u201d Some Trump supporters, either anticipating the barbs or irritated that many Hollywood stars have been outspoken in their horror at his election, made #BoycottGoldenGlobes trend on Twitter early on Sunday. The Golden Globes are great fun, and so is its red carpet. Among this year\u2019s first arrivals were the Stallone sisters, this year\u2019s Miss Golden Globes, shepherded about by their father Sylvester\u2019s     publicist no buttering up of reporters. A news crew from Canada was promised a question with the sisters but then told \u201cThey need to go do Twitter\u201d first. Issa Rae and Donald Glover were among the luminaries who admitted to feeling slightly intimidated to being there. Mr. Glover said he really wanted to meet Ms. Davis, and that he was still shocked at the huge response to \u201cAtlanta,\u201d his FX series. \u201cIt was supposed to be a punk show,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they screened it at A. F. I. and Scorsese was laughing. \u201d Ms. Rae, of the HBO show \u201cInsecure,\u201d said she was still adjusting to her growing fame. \u201cI\u2019m an introvert, I barely leave the house,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be out here is a blessing but I\u2019m like: \u2018Wow, guys. It\u2019s just me. \u201d Even though Netflix has upended the TV industry, that streaming service had never won in the best drama or comedy category at the Globes (and the Emmys, for that matter). That changed this year with \u201cThe Crown,\u201d  which was named best drama. Claire Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth, won for best actress in a drama. \u201cThe Crown\u201d beat out \u201cStranger Things,\u201d also from Netflix \u201cWestworld,\u201d the HBO series that practically requires a Ph. D. to understand it NBC\u2019s   \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones. \u201d Another closely watched television race was for best comedic actress, where Ms. Ross beat out some stiff competition to become the first black woman to win in the category since Debbie Allen in 1983. Also nominated were the   Globe winner Sarah Jessica Parker, for her role as a   suburban mother in HBO\u2019s \u201cDivorce\u201d Ms. Rae, nominated for her   performance in HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d Julia   from the network\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d and last year\u2019s winner, Rachel Bloom (\u201cCrazy  \u201d). Globe voters have ardently tried to leave behind their reputation for paying more attention to celebrity than honoring the year\u2019s best performances. Once upon a time, Globe attendees also bellied up to the open bar in a boozy spectacle, but nominees  \u2014   heeding the scolding eyes of their publicists  \u2014   have largely started sticking to water. Despite moments of seriousness, however, the Globes lived up its raucous reputation. The \u201cModern Family\u201d star Sofia Vergara made anus jokes from the stage. NBC censors bleeped expletives from Amy Schumer. Dinner guests in multiple instances chatted right through the speeches. As ever, the ballroom\u2019s smoking patio was chockablock with stars at one moment, Sophie Turner from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d lit her cigarette off one held by her   Maisie Williams. The young \u201cStranger Things\u201d cast members ran around taking selfies. As ever, the ceremony\u2019s success will be determined by the Nielsen ratings. About 18. 5 million people watched last year, down from 19. 3 million in 2015. Televised award shows in general have been suffering from viewer erosion, partly because there is a seemingly endless array of them, but NBC had high hopes for Mr. Fallon. He has a much wider fan base than Mr. Gervais and has been using his \u201cTonight Show\u201d perch as a promotional platform for the gig.'"}, "time": 1742563138.043958}
