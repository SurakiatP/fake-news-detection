Lounging in an oversize leather chair, his legs dangling over the edge, Newman cradled a   digital tablet containing hours of video clips. He pulled up the   plays Arizona had run this season. Even though Newman, as a cornerback, is charged with making receivers disappear, on every snap he also studies the habits of running backs, tight ends and quarterbacks and how they work in concert. Once, he figured out that a team would pass whenever one of its receivers fiddled with his gloves before the snap, and now he was hunting for another subtle hint to tip off what might be coming next. \u201cOoh!\u201d Newman said. He blurted an expletive and rewound the play he had just watched three, four, five times. \u201cI just picked up something,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, yeah. Oh, yeah, baby. See that?\u201d Motioning for a visitor to come closer, Newman cued up the clip again. The play, from just before halftime of Arizona\u2019s Week 8 loss at Carolina, featured four receivers, two on each side of the formation, with quarterback Carson Palmer lined up in the shotgun. As some of Carolina\u2019s players realigned, Palmer glanced right and then left while twirling his index fingers in the air like helicopter blades. \u201cIt\u2019s the same signals both sides,\u201d Newman said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re both running the same routes. \u201d The outside receivers bolted across the middle, and the inside receivers, crossing in front to disrupt the coverage, darted toward the back pylons. No defenders followed, both outside receivers came open, and Palmer, with his pick of either, threw left for the touchdown. Earlier, Newman had seen Palmer make that same gesture, but he needed a recurrence to feel confident jotting his discovery, in small and neat penmanship, into a notebook. \u201cThat,\u201d Newman said, \u201cwas superconfirmation right there. \u201d These revelations often occur when he is alone, in the sanctity of his apartment in the vibrant Uptown neighborhood here, where he lives by himself. His kitchen counter is speckled with the foodstuffs of a    bachelor  \u2014   cans of vegetable soup, a   loaf of old bread, a bag of dried mango  \u2014   and those who know Newman well credit his longevity in part to his having never been married. By 38, most N. F. L. cornerbacks have retired or, in far fewer cases, switched to the less physically demanding position of safety, no longer as capable of chasing bigger, stronger and faster receivers around the field. Newman is the oldest cornerback in the league by nearly five years, and by at least some measures, he is also one of the best. According to the analytics website Pro Football Focus, which rates him sixth over all, he has allowed the fewest yards (0. 64) per coverage snap. As Newman acknowledged, his freedom to do what he wants when he wants has prolonged his career. It has enabled him to obey what he called an intuitive understanding of his body, nurturing it with as much sleep, exercise and sustenance as he feels it needs. He keeps himself in such good shape that Minnesota\u2019s strength and conditioning coach, Brent Salazar, said Newman would be ready to play a game in June. It also helps  \u2014   and Newman shuddered, fearful of being jinxed, when this was mentioned  \u2014   that through nearly 14 seasons he has managed to avoid the sort of devastating injury that has ended or curtailed the careers of many of his peers. Newman remains an incredible athlete. But as his speed, power and quickness have deteriorated, he has relied ever more on his cognitive skills. His capacity for decoding opponents\u2019 tendencies through film study has mitigated his physiological decline. His aptitude for processing those tidbits and applying them on the field has preserved his livelihood. \u201cHe can think about what\u2019s going to happen and get his body to do it,\u201d Vikings safety Harrison Smith said. \u201cHe can make plays with his mind. \u201d Mike Zimmer, now Minnesota\u2019s coach, witnessed that gift up close when he served as Newman\u2019s defensive coordinator with Dallas from 2003 to 2006 and with Cincinnati from 2012 to 2013. Zimmer endorsed signing Newman, then 36, before the 2015 season, confident that he would be an asset in the Vikings\u2019 secondary and a positive influence on the team\u2019s young cornerbacks. They have spent two seasons absorbing his wisdom, accepting his red wine recommendations and poking fun at the old guy, presenting him with adult diapers, a walker and a cane that Newman keeps in his kitchen. But they have yet to take his job. A few minutes after 11 a. m. on a recent Tuesday, a day off for the Vikings, Newman walked into the makeshift auditorium at the team\u2019s complex in nearby Eden Prairie. It is cordoned off by black curtains in a corner of the indoor practice field. Accompanied by cornerbacks Mackensie Alexander and Trae Waynes, Newman set down his daily cup of black tea, the only caffeine he ingests, on a table in the front row. He could be mistaken for an eager pupil if he were not the stern teacher. It was the first such tutorial for Alexander, who was told the previous day by the secondary coach Jerry Gray to watch film with Newman. \u201cI want to soak up as much knowledge before he\u2019s gone,\u201d Alexander said. Newman prefers to study solo, or with people who respect his intensity and his mandate for silence. The only time he wears glasses is during these sessions. \u201cI want that clarity,\u201d Newman said. \u201cWhen football comes on, my senses are at their peak. I want my brain to be able to process and diagnose all the information and then retain it. \u201d He sat before a computer and clutched a remote that linked to a large projection screen that loomed on a stage. Newman clicked on Arizona\u2019s   and   pass plays and went through them in his favored manner, from most frequent to least, one formation at a time. He developed this methodology soon after entering the N. F. L. in 2003, taken fifth over all in the draft by the Cowboys, for whom he made two Pro Bowls. Teammates like Mario Edwards, Roy Williams and Darren Woodson mentored him, helping Newman expand his scope to focus on nuances like body language. He recognized that a team would run every time a receiver kept his hands on his knees, and he learned to eliminate certain routes if a receiver aligned with his outside foot up rather than his inside foot. \u201cYou see how their bodies move and how their feet are,\u201d Newman said. \u201cYou understand there\u2019s only certain places you can go. \u201d Early on in Dallas, Zimmer would give Newman homework: Return with all the routes a team ran out of a formation. He would watch every piece of footage to report his findings, and over the years he simplified his approach. Soon, he detected patterns. \u201cBy the end of the week, he\u2019d know everything about everybody,\u201d Mark Carrier, Newman\u2019s position coach in Cincinnati, said in a telephone interview. For instance, by watching every play in sequence that a team has run when two receivers line up on each side of a formation, Newman can divine concepts and combinations. He scrutinizes how close each receiver lines up to the quarterback. He notices what routes they run when they line up on the bottom of the numbers  \u2014   the digits that denote   increments  \u2014   compared with the top. He examines if the quarterback is under center or in the shotgun. If a tight end is in, Newman scans to see if routes go toward or away from him. There are finite possibilities, he knows, and soon they mesh in his mind, categorized by down and distance. He backs up those mental files in his notebook, which devotes two pages to every opponent. Reminders are written beneath a general heading and more detailed logs of personnel and formations organized by downs. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a person where if I could see something, I pretty much remember it,\u201d Newman said. Over dinner at a downtown steakhouse, he demonstrated his recall. The conversation shifted to Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis, whom Bengals receiver A. J. Green had beaten for a long touchdown in the teams\u2019 season opener. Newman cited the details, from the length of the play (54 yards) to the route that Brandon LaFell had run across the middle to paralyze the safety who was supposed to assist Revis, as if he were on the sideline that September afternoon. How many times did Newman watch that play? \u201cJust once,\u201d he said. In training camp, Minnesota teammates playfully accused Newman of conspiring with Norv Turner, then the Vikings\u2019 offensive coordinator. He called out routes so many times that they assumed Turner had told him the plays in advance. He had not. Newman just knew them  \u2014   or rather, he had deciphered them. Now his fellow cornerbacks sat observing as Newman cycled through one play after another, pausing only to rewind or scrawl a note. He said little, if anything. A few other players appeared, and the chatter increased. Newman pulled the hood of his sweatshirt over his bald head. When the   session ended, he packed up his gear and walked out, off to receive treatment. Because Newman knew this above all: No matter how diligently he prepares watching film, his discoveries are useless if he is not healthy enough to employ them. After last season, Vikings General Manager Rick Spielman had something to tell Newman. Also, to ask him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be 38 coming up, and you played at a high level this year,\u201d Spielman said he told him. \u201cI did not expect what you were able to do for us. How does your body feel? Do you think you can go another year?\u201d Minnesota\u2019s analytics, Spielman said, revealed that Newman was an outlier. Based on data culled over the last two decades, Newman had defied what Spielman called a \u201ccritical age,\u201d when cornerbacks\u2019 effectiveness almost always declines. Players who endure deep into their 30s, and even into their 40s, are mostly specialists  \u2014   long snappers, punters and kickers, like Adam Vinatieri, Indianapolis\u2019s    marvel  \u2014   or quarterbacks, like    Tom Brady, because they tend to absorb fewer     collisions. Few cornerbacks last that long because the position is just too taxing, demanding of its practitioners exceptional speed,   quickness, athleticism, anticipation, footwork and technique. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the   cornerback in the league is    Tramon Williams of the Cleveland Browns. Newman is the first corner to start at least eight games at 38 since Otis Smith in 2003, according to Elias. \u201cYou do the most unnatural thing, which is running backward, turning and then sprinting,\u201d Newman said. \u201cHow many people do you know that can run backward as somebody\u2019s running full speed at you?\u201d Mark Verstegen, the founder and president of EXOS, which operates   training centers nationwide, has for 16 years served as the director of performance for the National Football League Players Association. He called the action Newman described  \u2014   acceleration to deceleration to reacceleration  \u2014   the most stressful on a player\u2019s body beyond collisions. \u201cThe amount of pure   mileage that he has put on his body  \u2014   it\u2019s immeasurable,\u201d Verstegen said in a telephone interview. Comparing Newman to a racecar, Verstegen added, \u201cBut if you\u2019re taking care of your car really well and you know how to drive it smarter, you\u2019re still going to win the checkered flag even if you might have less horsepower and a little less tread on the tires. \u201d Newman takes an iconoclastic approach to his wellness. For one thing, he does not use a nutritionist. In maintaining his muscular 195 pounds, the    Newman does not deprive himself  \u2014   at the steakhouse, he ordered lamb chops and a Caesar salad with anchovies  \u2014   but he rarely indulges. With few exceptions, he limits his movement between team headquarters, where he eats a smart breakfast (  eggs without the yolk, half a waffle, oatmeal with berries) and lunch, and his apartment, which is near a tangle of food options. He orders the same food at the same restaurants on the same night (crab leg Wednesdays! ). At the Japanese place where he dines on Thursdays, he sits at the same seat, on the far edge of the bar, to await what the bartender calls Newman\u2019s usual: a teriyaki chicken bowl (sauce on the side) and a lava roll (shrimp tempura and avocado topped with yellowfin tuna and sauce) complemented by a healthy pour of pinot noir. \u201cI try to pay attention to some of the stuff that I put in my body now that I\u2019m older,\u201d said Newman, who also takes multivitamins,   fatty acids and supplements promoting joint and   health. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my metabolism is going to get superslow. But I\u2019ve still got abs and stuff. How many     have abs?\u201d Newman has never tested positive under the league\u2019s    policy and is so fastidious about what he puts in his body that he does not understand how players get caught. \u201cYou have all the tools to find out what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad you got an app to tell you all that,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s simple. \u201d In the   he does not follow the team\u2019s strength and conditioning program and for the past few years has not even worked out regularly with a trainer. He enjoys the spontaneity of tapping thoughts into his phone at breakfast and then amending the plan, if necessary, at the LA Fitness he visits five minutes from his   residence in Dallas. \u201cI\u2019ve worked out all my life, so I\u2019ve learned all this free information,\u201d Newman said. \u201cI know I need to do whatever they ask after a certain period of time, so I work on the things I feel like I need to work on. \u201d His goal, when he was younger, was just \u201cto get big. \u201d He realized the fallacy of that strategy when a misdiagnosed knee injury in his second N. F. L. season affected his strength and mobility for several years, even if it took until his fifth season for him to miss a game. He loves doing squats, and his former Bengals teammate Leon Hall, who is now with the Giants, said he rued that he would always have to remove weight plates if he   after Newman. But Newman concentrates on working the smaller, stabilizing muscles around his joints. A former champion sprinter at Kansas State, Newman now runs as fast as he needs to. The winner of the shuttle drill, which evaluates lateral movement and    skills, at the 2003 scouting combine, Newman now is as quick as he needs to be. He will never regain those attributes. But in the spring and summer, he wards off regression with   pickup basketball games, three times a week, against former N. B. A. and college players, a cardiovascular workout that he modifies to fulfill his needs. Newman reaps no physical benefits from scoring. He channels his energy into suffocating defense. He guards the opposition\u2019s best offensive player. \u201cThey understand why I\u2019m there,\u201d Newman said. To work on quickness, many cornerbacks set up cones every 5 yards and then backpedal and break, again and again. That drill is popular, Newman said, but not functional. \u201cThat\u2019s not reactive,\u201d Newman said. \u201cOur sport is 100 percent reactive. \u201d He continued: \u201cI do the same things, just in a different way. In football, you turn and you reach out with your hand, use your arms, but in basketball you can\u2019t do that you use all feet. You pick up a guy full court, you shuffle back, and then you\u2019re breaking, turning and opening and cutting him off, trying to stay in front. If he gets by, you\u2019ve got to cut him off and take the right angles. It\u2019s literally the same thing as a corner. \u201d As he has gotten older, Newman has not dedicated additional time to recovery. But he has a standing appointment with the Vikings\u2019 contracted acupuncturist, Hilary Patzer, on Tuesday mornings even though he hates needles  \u2014   or rather, he hated them until Patzer treated his tight back. \u201cI thought she was a witch at first, from Salem,\u201d Newman said, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never looked back. \u201d Newman considers this hour, which also includes the ancient Chinese healing method known as cupping, a vital part of his weekly recovery. Depending on how much hitting he did in the previous game, pain often does not set in until Wednesday, when practice resumes. It usually dissipates by Thursday. \u201cOut of nowhere, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m 26 again,\u201d Newman said. He devotes part of his afternoon a few days a week to napping, this on top of the eight hours of sleep  \u2014   up at 7:20 a. m. in bed by 11 p. m.  \u2014   he makes sure he gets. Instead of braving   traffic, he remains at the complex an extra 30 to 45 minutes, sitting in the massage chair or donning compression boots to facilitate leg circulation. When he returns the next day, he invariably hears some younger teammates talking about their aches. And this is what he tells them: \u201cYou\u2019re walking around like I\u2019m supposed to be walking around. You feel like I\u2019m supposed to feel. \u201d Newman said he had not decided when he would retire. Could be after this season, or maybe next, depending on the demand for his services. But it will be soon, which saddens Gray, his secondary coach, who said he had seen no evidence that Newman\u2019s body or mind was betraying him. Asked for an example of Newman\u2019s mastery, Gray offered two, each of which resulted in an interception. The first came in a Week 10 victory last season at Oakland. Newman was supposed to thwart Amari Cooper\u2019s release and then linger on the outside. But knowing he had a chance to undercut Cooper, Newman trusted his intuition and swooped inside. \u201cI\u2019m watching and thinking there\u2019s no way,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI knew he knew that play because I know I didn\u2019t coach him. \u201d The second example reflects Newman\u2019s acumen. Late in the third quarter of a Week 3 win at Carolina this season, Newman matched up against Ted Ginn Jr. Trying to gain separation, Ginn ran tight with him for about 13 yards before making a move intended to force Newman to turn his hips in the opposite direction. It did not fool him. He knew that Ginn would come back, and when he did, Newman dashed in front to grab the ball along Carolina\u2019s sideline. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like batters looking for pitches,\u201d Newman said. \u201cYou try to see the ball coming out of their hand and see where the release point\u2019s at. For us, though, it\u2019s not as   as that. \u201d At the line of scrimmage, he tries decrypting the quarterback\u2019s cadence and audibles. He uploads receivers\u2019 mannerisms. When the ball is snapped, the play unfolds, to him, in slow motion. He begins expecting a catalog of possible routes, all of which are predicated on timing, and based on the receiver\u2019s release or the depth of the quarterback\u2019s drop, he starts winnowing them down. Zimmer favors an aggressive defensive scheme that often asks cornerbacks to play press coverage, denying the receiver a free release off the line. Newman rides receivers, feeling the route, aiming to run it better than they can. But when he plays off coverage, leaving space between him and the receiver, Newman cheats, he said, by watching the first three steps of the quarterback\u2019s drop  \u2014   and sometimes even the first five. From studying the quarterback, Newman knows exactly how he receives the ball, steps, plants and turns his shoulders to throw. There are plays, Newman said, when he knows precisely what will happen. As he spoke, he happened to look up at the television in his apartment, which was showing a Monday night game between the Giants and the Bengals. Based on where Green, his former Cincinnati teammate, lined up, Newman predicted he would run a stop, a slant or, more likely, a screen (which is was Green did). Once Newman thought he had cracked Palmer\u2019s copter signal from his armchair, he wanted to delve a bit into some of Arizona\u2019s receivers. He prompted a snippet of Michael Floyd running a comeback, a basic route in which a receiver runs, stops and turns toward the quarterback. Only the most adept can stop without having their momentum drive them downfield. Many receivers, particularly bigger ones, slow themselves by making rapid chopping movements with their hands and dropping their bodies. \u201cI\u2019m not watching his hips I\u2019m watching his entire frame,\u201d Newman said. \u201cWhen I see the body go from high to low, I know he\u2019s making his move. That\u2019s when I start to break. \u201d Newman moved on to Larry Fitzgerald, who lined up behind other receivers at the top of the screen. As Fitzgerald went in motion, Newman correctly posited that he was getting a jump on his over route, an angled dash across the middle. Newman did not know whether he would be defending Fitzgerald, but generally speaking, he said, he prefers playing taller receivers like Fitzgerald off the ball so that he can counter their height with his quickness. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing what I do well versus what they don\u2019t do as well,\u201d Newman said. That is the essence of Newman\u2019s preparation, the hours he invests scouring film, surveying weaknesses, searching for clues that will sustain his value to the Vikings. His pursuit consumes him, and no matter how often he talks on FaceTime with his \u201ckind of girlfriend\u201d in California, in those spare moments away from his teammates  \u2014   or the restaurant staff members who know him, or the apartment building concierge who invited him to watch the Vikings play, not realizing Newman would be busy that day  \u2014   loneliness still descends. \u201cFootball\u2019s like my escape,\u201d Newman said. \u201cIt\u2019s my everything. \u201d He yawned. His tablet needed recharging, and so did he. Newman has many hobbies  \u2014   golfing, traveling, flying drones  \u2014   but as a budding oenophile, he is perhaps most passionate about wine: strictly red, usually cabernet sauvignon or pinot noir. When he drifts off to sleep, exhausted, his mind is blank, he said, blissfully uncluttered by routes and formations, quarterbacks and receivers, his football mortality. Except for one thing. \u201cI just think about grapes,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628595.62429}
