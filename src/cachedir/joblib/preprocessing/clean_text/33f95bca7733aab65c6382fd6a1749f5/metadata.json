What you see in public is the same thing I see in private. Do they feel responsibility because they\u2019re historic figures? Yes, they do. But I don\u2019t think it has made them be different than who they are. The president prides himself on the fact that his administration hasn\u2019t had a scandal and he hasn\u2019t done something to embarrass himself. That is not because he is being someone other that who he is. That\u2019s who he is. That is who they are. And that is what really resonates with the American people. \u201d (  NYP) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564602.8474011}
