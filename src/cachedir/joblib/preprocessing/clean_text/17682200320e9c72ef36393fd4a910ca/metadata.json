[\u201cDICE isn\u2019t done with Star Wars,\u201d the developer posted on EA\u2019s official Battlefront blog, but the team behind 2015\u2019s reboot of the cult classic multiplayer games has \u201cshifted its focus\u201d toward \u201cthe next great Star Wars game. \u201d This is, of course, the inevitable Battlefront 2.  DICE isn\u2019t hogging all the credit  \u2014   or blame, depending on your opinion of 2015\u2019s Battlefront. They\u2019ve called their next release a \u201ccollaborative effort\u201d between themselves and the teams at developers Criterion and Motive. According to Motive\u2019s Jade Raymond: A new installment of Star Wars Battlefront is currently in development at DICE, in collaboration with Motive Studios in Montreal. Our team at Motive team is growing quickly, and making great progress in building out a significant new addition to the game. While we\u2019re not ready to get into specifics right now, we have started development of this game by listening to all of the feedback we received, while also innovating in new areas I think you\u2019re all going to be excited about. While DICE\u2019s announcement means that we won\u2019t see any further content added to the offline Skirmish mode introduced to Battlefront last year, 2017\u2019s   will feature a full single player campaign that spans \u201cmultiple Star Wars eras,\u201d according to EA CEO Andrew Wilson himself during an earnings call on January 31: Our next Star Wars Battlefront will be even bigger, taking players into more locations and allowing them to play with more heroes and characters across multiple Star Wars eras. There will be new ways to play, including an all new   campaign and much, much more that we are excited to share with our players in the months ahead. Star Wars Battlefront was a hopeful first attempt, a   to the sights and sounds of the iconic series. Unfortunately, even CFO Blake Jorgensen was forced to admit that it didn\u2019t have enough depth to hold on to many of its most hardcore players. It was a game as praised as it was maligned, prioritizing atmosphere and accessibility over longevity. Despite its many criticisms, fans devoured it. It sold upwards of 14 million copies. The next game is doubling down on scope and depth alike, and EA is devoting those three studios to make sure it succeeds. Wilson said that they \u201chave every reason to believe\u201d that they\u2019ll be able to deliver \u201cexactly what fans are asking for. \u201d Star Wars Battlefront 2 will release some time in late 2017, probably in the vicinity of Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\u2019s theatrical premier in December.
