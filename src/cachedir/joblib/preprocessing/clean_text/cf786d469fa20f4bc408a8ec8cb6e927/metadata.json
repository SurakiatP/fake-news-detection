Trump claimed on Twitter that he was losing the popular vote because of major fraud by millions of voters, one of the states he pointed to was California, where the latest voting returns showed Hillary Clinton, the Democrat, crushing Mr. Trump. But Mr. Trump\u2019s baseless claim led to a furious reaction from California\u2019s top election official, Alex Padilla, the secretary of state, this weekend. Mr. Padilla asserted that there was no evidence for the claim by the   and denounced Mr. Trump for what he said was unpresidential behavior. \u201cHis unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd,\u201d Mr. Padilla posted on Twitter. \u201cHis reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a  . \u201d This state has historically been slow to count ballots, a reflection of both its vast size and inefficiencies in many county voting operations. Given the fact that this is an overwhelmingly Democratic state, that has meant that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s total vote count has grown steadily as ballots were tallied, adding to a national lead of close to two million votes. As of Saturday, Mrs. Clinton had 8. 1 million votes in California, compared with 4. 2 million for Mr. Trump, according to the secretary of state\u2019s office. It was not clear when the vote count might be concluded. The count, and outcome, has been no surprise to anyone in a state with a history of slow  . Officials in both parties had predicted this would happen as early as election night. Given California\u2019s long Democratic history, it was never in play during this presidential election. But as the nation\u2019s most populated state, it tends to have a significant influence on final national voting margins, as is apparently the case this year. Mr. Trump signaled out three states in his post of Twitter on \u201cserious voter fraud\u201d  \u2014   Virginia, New Hampshire and California. He offered no evidence to back up the claim. His remarks came as he denounced calls for a recount in three states that he won by relatively small margins: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Jill Stein, who was the Green Party candidate for president, said that she would move for a recount. Aides to Mrs. Clinton said they would cooperate with the effort, even as they made it clear they thought it would not change the outcome. Mr. Padilla is the   Latino elected to state office in California. Mr. Trump\u2019s poor showing here, many Democrats and Republicans said, came in no small part because of his attacks on what he described as the threat of illegal immigration  \u2014   particularly by Mexicans. About 40 percent of California\u2019s population is Latino. \u201cIt appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him,\u201d Mr. Padilla said.'"}, "time": 1742628359.0778778}
