The Workologist is a guy with   opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited. I was one of several people my boss bullied into resignation by collecting gossip, pressuring people to say vaguely critical things and overstating what they said  \u2014   a witch hunt, basically. When I saw this happening to me, I consulted a lawyer, but ultimately concluded I had no interest in saying or doing anything to continue being associated with this vitriolic nut. I resigned and had a better job lined up five days later. I win.  Nonetheless, I was angry and resentful, I think reasonably. I composed my detailed defense, pointing out that my boss knew she was lying, and that she is an evil, disgraceful woman. I felt much better  \u2014   but I did not send the email, and moved on emotionally.  Recently my separation from that employer became official (there was a delay to account for leave time I was owed). Feeling that this horrid woman could no longer hurt me, I reread my email draft and came very close to sending it  \u2014   maybe with a blind copy to her boss. I believe sending it will make me feel more victorious, but maybe it risks opening cans of worms I cannot foresee. I can\u2019t decide if not sending it will make me feel like the better person, or if I\u2019ll be nagged by the sense that I allowed this boss to bully me. Shall I send or delete? ANONYMOUS I am a fan of the raw, unvarnished   letter. Stating your case precisely as you see it, with absolutely no regard for diplomacy, nicety or consequences, can be a genuinely cathartic exercise. But I\u2019m not a fan of actually sending such notes. (In fact, make sure you never do this as a draft in your official company email system this letter should exist only in a place your employers don\u2019t have access to.) Sometimes it\u2019s appropriate to submit a formal letter of resignation, but that is a separate exercise: Pour out your venom first, then start from scratch, composing yourself before you compose a statement you expect others to read. In this case, you may be right on the facts, but it\u2019s hard to deny, based on the language you\u2019re using, that you are still angry and resentful. This is rarely a productive frame of mind for convincing anyone else (your boss\u2019s boss, let\u2019s say) that you are offering a reasonable assessment. At best, you\u2019ll communicate bitterness at worst, any mention of your lawyer might be interpreted as a veiled legal threat, which I doubt is your goal. And what is your goal? It\u2019s not clear why you need to feel more \u201cvictorious\u201d right after declaring victory for easily proving your own worth by finding new work elsewhere. Even if you see this boss as a liability to the company and think her supervisor should know, that would be a completely different letter  \u2014   focused not on you but on the organization. But I generally see little point in trying to reform a company after you\u2019ve quit. Maybe you\u2019re having second thoughts about having resigned. That, too, is a different issue. You made a decision you felt was in your best interest, and there is no reason to get hung up on it. Focus on your future, not on continuing battles from your past. I supervise an employee who I know is considering moving on. I don\u2019t begrudge him this because I can\u2019t offer him the   position he wants. But I anticipate that he may ask me for a professional reference, and I\u2019m not sure how to respond. He\u2019s done decent work over all. But he\u2019s demonstrated some frustrating traits. For example, he doesn\u2019t respond reliably to emails while working remotely, and he waits for others to solve problems for him. I have no desire to sabotage his prospects (he\u2019s young and at the beginning of his professional life) by withholding a reference or blabbing unnecessarily about his flaws. But if asked directly about things he needs to improve, I would not lie. What should I do if he asks for a reference? S. S. SEATTLE You could respond with a version of what you\u2019ve said here. It sounds like, in general, you would endorse his work, you wish him well and you would not go out of your way to criticize him. That said (you could tell him) there are a few matters you would be honest about if asked  \u2014   the ones you\u2019ve named. End on a positive note by reiterating that you also see his good qualities and don\u2019t want to prevent him from finding the   work you know he\u2019s looking for. At that point, it\u2019s really up to him. An alternative that has become popular is to adopt an \u201conly the facts\u201d policy: Tell him you\u2019ll confirm dates of employment and the like, but that\u2019s it. This is nothing personal, just company rules, or even your own personal rules. That may feel like a dodge  \u2014   because it is  \u2014   but it\u2019s common practice at many organizations. (Obviously, if you do this you have to stick to it.) There\u2019s one more option that might be more productive: a preventive strike. Have a conversation with this employee about the pros and cons of his performance before he announces he\u2019s quitting. Start with the good points, note where he could do better, and circle back to the positive, perhaps noting his potential or some such. (Starting and ending on a high note is known as a \u201ccriticism sandwich. \u201d) It is honest and should help him whether he stays or goes  \u2014   and might even benefit you.'"}, "time": 1742563098.8022726}
