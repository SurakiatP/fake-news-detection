Any resemblance of characters in the story to people in real life is entirely intentional, and their dialogue is typically cut, with only insignificant modifications, from books, articles, or interviews. When substantive remarks derive from a source not mentioned explicitly in the text, the source is described at the end of the episode in which they appear. By Outis Philalithopoulos, who met an untimely end five years ago, and now \u201cwears the chains he forged in life\u201d as an economist. I had imagined that this new existence would be like working for the NSA, with official clearance to watch over my loved ones and enemies. But I continue to see through a glass darkly \u2013 mostly only confused impressions, and recently a sense of impending doom lying heavily upon the United States. Once in a while, though, clearer images slip through the veil, like letters washing up on the woeful banks of the Acheron. So it was that I found myself perusing a February article by philosopher John Holbo in the influential blog Crooked Timber. He began with a question that got my attention: What is liberalism? What is conservatism? Then he noted: If you are interested in getting answers to these questions, you (probably) want the answers to do two things for you: 1) Give you the best possible version of this thing. What is the best liberalism/conservatism could be, as political philosophy? [\u2026] 2) Give you insight into what\u2019s going on in real politics. What constructions of liberalism/conservatism, as philosophies, give me the best handle on what\u2019s going on in the US election cycle, say? Holbo pointed out that #1 and #2 are not the same thing, and trying to do both at once creates confusion. For example: Suppose you think the best, most defensible philosophical conservatism would be G.A. Cohen\u2019s conservatism . Intellectually, that might be rather fine, yet useless for getting a grip on real U.S. politics. You can\u2019t make sense of the Republican candidate line-up by measuring relative degrees of departure from what [Cohen] thinks conservatism ought to be. True, I thought to myself, conservatives don\u2019t measure up to their ideals. Fortunately, describing people like me \u2013 liberals, progressives, the Left, whatever you want to call us \u2013 is easier. Corey Robin gave a straightforward definition in his 2011 The Reactionary Mind , Since the modern era began, men and women in subordinate positions have marched against their superiors in the state, church, workplace, and other hierarchical institutions. They have gathered under different banners \u2013 the labor movement, feminism, abolition, socialism \u2013 and shouted different slogans: freedom, equality, rights, democracy, revolution. Then I had a disturbing thought. Isn\u2019t Robin\u2019s definition a textbook example of #1? It is \u201cthe best, most defensible\u201d idea of what liberalism could be: a patchwork of causes throughout history that in retrospect I want to identify with, while leaving on the cutting floor everything else that has called itself \u201cLeft.\u201d What would happen if someone were to define us progressives by #2? By our actions and our actual effects upon the world, and not by our language or our ideals? Was that where Holbo was going? I braced myself as I continued to read the article. But I reached the end, and after flipping through the 207 comments by what seemed to be mostly university faculty, I relaxed. While considerable effort had gone into attempts to define the unattractive, non-ideal reality of conservativism, the only new definition of liberalism offered was: To me being left wing means not killing (lots of brown) people, being critical of power and authority and trying not to be a (selfish) dick. Sounded good to me. Clearly most of these well-educated people agreed that Robin\u2019s definition was basically correct, with real life only slightly messier than the ideal. Maybe for liberalism, #1 and #2 are more or less the same thing. Then again, I thought with a twinge of unease, they are mostly liberals like me. Maybe I should seek what might be painful truths. I had an idea about where to start looking, and I flitted up a shadowy hill, where there huddled a bespectacled spirit with hunched shoulders. \u201cAllan,\u201d I began. Allan Bloom squinted at me. \u201cDo I have the pleasure of meeting a fellow elitist?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, startled. \u201cNo, I was hoping you could tell me why liberalism is evil.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back,\u201d I implored him. \u201cI can handle the truth.\u201d \u201cA corrosive ideology has taken over the American mind,\u201d he began. \u201cBy now, almost everyone, especially in the universities, believes that truth is relative. They treat this relativity as a moral postulate, as the condition of a free society. To them, the real danger is people who think they are right, and the solution is not to correct mistakes and really become right \u2013 it is not to think you are right at all. The Left of today does not believe in itself or in what it does.\u201d \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d I said, bowing, and went to ponder his words. It was exciting to think of myself in Bloom\u2019s terms. Was I one molecule of a transhistorical acid that was eating away at all truth in the world? I thought about myself and my Left-oriented friends. Did we believe that sexual repression, the Iraq War, overt and subtle racism, anti-immigrant bias, and gender stereotyping were absolutely wrong? Yes. Did we believe in ourselves? Of course. With relief but also a hint of disappointment, I concluded that even the brilliant Bloom had not succeeded in painting a convincing portrait of what, if anything, was evil about liberalism. Back to Robin\u2019s definition, I thought to myself, and there things would have ended if not for\u2026 \u201cOUTIS!\u201d bellowed a voice. I whirled around. \u201cPolyphemus,\u201d I said uncomfortably. \u201cI thought we had agreed that I had nothing to do with that burning stake\u2026\u201d \u201cNO!\u201d interrupted the Cyclops. \u201cI come here for YOU, not the accursed son of Laertes. I have a QUESTION!\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou have thought a little about your identy, o No-Name, and what it means to be a liberal. But what if being a liberal means neither being the leaven of the world, nor yetbeing a dark agent of the Apocalypse?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said quickly. \u201cWhat if 21st century liberal culture is simply one society that happens to be influential in this time and place? A culture in which idealism and grandeur are mixed with wretchedness and compromises and contradiction? One that does not stand astride history but has been produced by history and has not escaped it? What if, in a word, it is a culture like other cultures?\u201d \u201cRidiculous!\u201d I burst out. \u201cYou\u2019re saying there\u2019s no difference between us and the ancient Greeks, who had slavery? Or the 19th century British Empire, whose missionaries laid waste to India? Or the Eskimos, who had rigidly defined sex roles that oppressed women?\u201d \u201cConsole yourself with these facile mantras,\u201d sneered Polyphemus. \u201c You are the only one of us to speak of sameness.\u201d \u201cOf course I understand that liberal culture of today has a history,\u201d I muttered. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t think we are some sort of elect, better than all other cultures that have other lived, except of course\u2026\u201d I stopped. Polyphemus laughed. \u201cYou are a droll one, doughty Outis,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIf Bloom had made a more persuasive case that progressivism were a monstrous contagion destroying all that is good, you could have accepted it. What you cannot accept is that it might be human.\u201d \u201cI can accept anything!\u201d I snapped. \u201cReally?\u201d The Cyclops looked at me skeptically. I nodded. \u201cVery well,\u201d Polyphemus. \u201cIf you truly wish it, a path will be provided that you can tread, seeking whatever truth you may. You will be haunted tonight by three spirits.\u201d * * * In the next episode, Outis meets a Spirit whom he fails to recognize, and travels back into the past of liberalism.
