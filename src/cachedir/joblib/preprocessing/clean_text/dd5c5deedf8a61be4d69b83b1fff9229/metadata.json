Posted on Home \u00bb Headlines \u00bb World News \u00bb FBI Closes In On Hillary! \\nWe now have 5 separate FBI cases probing the Hillary-Bill Clinton inner circle. Here is the background on those 5 cases and all of the major players that we are going to cover: \\n\\nFIVE INVESTIGATIONS UNDERGOING BY THE FBI ON CLINTON, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND INNER CIRCLE/TRUMP SURPASSES CLINTON IN THE POLLS/DEUTSCHE BANK STOCK PLUMMETS AGAIN/DB\u2019S CHIEF ECONOMIST BLASTS THE ECB AGAIN: THEY MUST BE HURTING!/569,000 OZ ADDED TO THE SLV/2.67 TONNES ADDED TO THE GLD \\nGold closed at $1306.40 up $20.40 \\nsilver closed at $18.66 or up 47 cents. \\nAccess market prices: THE DAILY GOLD FIX REPORT FROM SHANGHAI AND LONDON \\n. \\nThe Shanghai fix is at 10:15 pm est and 2:15 am est \\nThe fix for London is at 5:30 am est (first fix) and 10 am est (second fix) \\nThus Shanghai\u2019s second fix corresponds to 195 minutes before London\u2019s first fix. \\nAnd now the fix recordings: \\nShanghai morning fix Nov 2 ( 10:15 pm est last night): $ 1294.53 \\nNY ACCESS PRICE: $1289.70 (AT THE EXACT SAME TIME) \\nShanghai afternoon fix: 2: 15 am est (second fix/early morning):$ 1296.08 \\nNY ACCESS PRICE: 1291.70 (AT THE EXACT SAME TIME/2:15 am) \\nHUGE SPREAD TODAY!! 4 dollars \\n\\nLondon Fix: Nov 2: 5:30 am est : $1295.85 (NY: same time: $1296.10: 5:30AM ) \\nLondon Second fix Nov 2: 10 am est : $1303.75 (NY same time: $1301.75 , 10 AM ) \\nShanghai premium in silver over NY: 59 cents. \\nIt seems that Shanghai pricing is higher than the other two , (NY and London). The spread has been occurring on a regular basis and thus I expect to see arbitrage happening as investors buy the lower priced NY gold and sell to China at the higher price. This should drain the comex. \\nAlso why would mining companies hand in their gold to the comex and receive constantly lower prices. They would be open to lawsuits if they knowingly continue to supply the comex despite the fact that they could be receiving higher prices in Shanghai. \\nend \\nNOTICES FILINGS FOR NOVEMBER CONTRACT MONTH: 381 NOTICES FOR 38,100 OZ TONES \\nNOTICES FOR NOVEMBER CONTRACT MONTH FOR SILVER: 12 NOTICES OR 60,000 OZ \\n\\nLet us have a look at the data for today \\n. \\n\\nIn silver, the total open interest ROSE by 4181 contracts UP to 196,912.
