Another takes orders for traditional Chinese massages by smartphone. They are just two of the 710   being nurtured here. Anywhere else, an incubator like Dream Town would be a vision of venture capitalists, angel investors or technology stalwarts. But this is China. The Chinese Communist Party doesn\u2019t trust the invisible hand of capitalism alone to encourage entrepreneurship, especially since it is a big part of the leadership\u2019s strategy to reshape the sagging economy. Which is why the government of Hangzhou  \u2014   a former royal capital that has been a major commercial hub for more than a millennium  \u2014   built Dream Town and lavishes resources on  . The businesses here get a slate of benefits like subsidized rent, cash handouts and special training, all courtesy of the city. Chemayi, which offers car repair services through a smartphone app, is staying   at Dream Town for three years and is applying for as much as $450, 000 in subsidies from city authorities to help pay salaries and buy equipment. \u201cFrom the central government all the way down to local governments, we have seen a lot of warm support,\u201d said Li Liheng,   and chief executive of Chemayi. For much of China\u2019s long economic boom, young people flocked to manufacturing zones for jobs making bluejeans or iPhones. But today China is trying to move beyond just being the world\u2019s factory floor. Policy makers want the next generation to find   work in modern offices, creating the ideas, technologies and jobs to feed the country\u2019s future growth. Premier Li Keqiang frequently calls for \u201cmass entrepreneurship. \u201d In March at the National People\u2019s Congress, he bragged that 12, 000 new companies were founded each day in 2015. The entrepreneurial embrace comes with lots of financial support. Across the country, officials are creating investment funds, providing cash subsidies and building incubators. \u201cWithout these kinds of subsidies, you only rely on private money, and you wouldn\u2019t see so many technology   happening today,\u201d said Ning Tao, a partner at Innovation Works, a venture capital fund in Beijing. \u201cWithout quantity, you cannot have quality. \u201d But the heavy spending is adding to worries about an inflating bubble in the world of China\u2019s tiniest companies. Along with the government funds, venture capital money is flooding the country. About $49 billion in deals were made last year, making China second only to the United States, according to the accounting firm Ernst  Young. Some economists and entrepreneurs are concerned that the government is helping fuel a frenzy that might ultimately result in failed businesses, wasted resources and financial losses. Just one city, Suzhou, near Shanghai, has announced it will open 300 incubators by 2020 to house 30, 000  . Beijing\u2019s policy makers have a long history of giving favored companies easy access to loans and subsidies to propel certain industries, with both good and bad consequences. Though that tactic lubricated the nation\u2019s industrialization, it also contributed to the excess that has buried the country in empty apartment blocks, mothballed cement plants and sputtering steel mills  \u2014   all of which threaten the economy\u2019s stability. \u201cI think the subsidies shouldn\u2019t be a   policy,\u201d Jin Xiangrong, an economist at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, said of the   support programs. \u201cThey can lead to overcapacity like the kind we see now in China\u2019s manufacturing sector, which is largely a result of government support. \u201d Hangzhou city officials turned down requests for interviews. At Dream Town, Mr. Li, 39, frets more about his own business. He got the initial idea for Chemayi in 2009 after a car accident. To find a trustworthy mechanic, he searched online, asked friends for advice and visited repair shops. But Mr. Li found it difficult to judge who was reliable. A car culture  \u2014   and all the services that come with it  \u2014   is relatively new in China. Aiming to fill the information void, he and three friends set up Chemayi in 2013 with 5 million renminbi (currently $750, 000) of their own money. For an annual fee, Chemayi sends out staff members to help fix flat tires, paint scratches or repair   engines. \u201cHenry Ford is gone for so many years, but we are still driving his cars,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cI felt that I also must pursue a cause that will persist after I\u2019m gone. \u201d Chemayi beat out more than two dozen other   for a coveted space in Dream Town in a 2014 competition. Another   Ouyang Feng, delivered a   presentation to a panel of judges who peppered him with questions about Chemayi\u2019s business model and future prospects. The provincial governor watched over the grilling. In the end, the committee awarded Chemayi a   golden key that symbolically opened the doors to Dream Town. Chemayi now has 284 employees in four cities, with plans to reach 1, 000 by the end of the year. Mr. Li said his company had raised $22 million in private money and turned a profit of about 10 million renminbi last year. \u201cA lot of Chinese people want to be successful. They want to initiate change through innovation,\u201d Mr. Li said in his spacious corner office, while fussing with a traditional Chinese wooden   set. \u201cThat is a formidable power. \u201d Hangzhou is a natural center for China\u2019s   fever. After China embraced capitalist reform in the 1980s, Zhejiang province, of which Hangzhou is the capital, emerged as a leading base for the export industries that fueled the country\u2019s rapid growth. Factories pumped out products like socks and plastic Christmas trees. Now that zeal for commerce is being channeled into technology  . Hangzhou is home to China\u2019s most famous internet company, the   giant Alibaba, which has become a training ground for   entrepreneurs. The neighborhoods near Alibaba\u2019s sprawling campus, once a poorly developed area on the city\u2019s outskirts, now make up a budding tech center with newly built office parks like Dream Town, dominated by ambitious college graduates, angel investors and venture capitalists. The local restaurants have become hangouts to exchange ideas and gossip over fried squid and stewed pork and eggs. Feng Xiao is typical of this new breed. Mr. Feng, 39 and a Hangzhou native, spent 11 years at Alibaba, mainly in sales and marketing. \u201cThere is a Chinese proverb, \u2018The soil is too rich,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feng said. Alibaba \u201coffered you a lot of opportunities. It was easy to have a sense of success. But I wanted to be able to start from scratch. \u201d His   was born in Alibaba\u2019s cafeteria, where he ate meal after meal. \u201cI really missed Mom\u2019s cooking,\u201d he said. He figured that many other people, trapped working for long hours far from home, felt the same. Mr. Feng and two other Alibaba employees left their jobs in 2014 and opened a food delivery service, Mishi. Their plan was to connect people willing to prepare homemade meals with    professionals who were too busy to cook. They set up shop in a friend\u2019s empty house, decorated with secondhand furniture and photos from home. Along with raising $19 million from private investors, Mishi caught the eye of the Hangzhou city government. In 2014, district officials awarded Mishi 5 million renminbi to help pay the bills. Its rent in a Hangzhou office park is also subsidized. \u201cThe most important thing on the part of the government is whether they are open\u201d to new types of businesses, Mr. Feng said. \u201cWe are glad to see they are aggressively supporting us. \u201d Hangzhou represents what Chinese leaders see as the nation\u2019s economic future. The country used to generate astronomical growth rates by depending heavily on   exports and extremely high investment in apartment towers, factories and highways. China built so many steel mills that it can produce 10 times as much steel as the United States. But today, costs are rising, eating away at the competitiveness of many export industries. The long investment boom has saddled the economy with too many factories and a mountain of debt. Instead, policy makers are encouraging a shift to new growth engines, like services and high tech. The entrepreneurial focus is providing an economic boost for Hangzhou. The city\u2019s gross domestic product rose 10. 2 percent in 2015, compared with the 6. 9 percent national growth rate. Hangzhou\u2019s service sector, which includes many   was the main engine of that strong performance, surging 14. 6 percent. \u201cThe Chinese know that   enterprises are not going to employ everybody,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at GGV Capital, a venture capital firm that operates in both Silicon Valley and China. \u201cThey need young people to create jobs for themselves, so they are encouraging them to try something new. \u201d Mishi, the food delivery   has created 100   jobs, and has bolstered the incomes of more than 10, 000 home chefs. Cai Liangen, a retired businessman turned Mishi cook, learned about the   when a marketing team visited his apartment complex seeking to enlist new chefs. Last November, he and his wife began making local specialties in their kitchen, including a sliced pork dish prepared with \u201cmy mother\u2019s secret recipe,\u201d Mr. Cai said. They now receive 40 orders a day and earn 5, 000 renminbi a month, increasing their total income 70 percent. \u201cWe do it because we love to cook,\u201d Mr. Cai said, \u201cbut the money is good to have, too. \u201d After submitting a   proposal in 2014 to join a Hangzhou incubator, Ai Binke sat nervously before a committee of tech industry executives who questioned his future prospects. His software company, Yun Ran Internet of Things, had only four employees, and its business deals had been small. But his   Mr. Ai explained to the committee, had great potential. That was sufficient for the judges to award him 100, 000 renminbi in subsidies. The bulk, roughly 70 percent, was instantly transferred into his corporate bank account. \u201cAs long as you run projects that are encouraged by the Hangzhou government, you can get the subsidies,\u201d said Mr. Ai, 29. \u201cIt\u2019s not very difficult. \u201d Local governments around China are spending heavily on  . In Shenzhen, authorities are offering to subsidize up to 70 percent of rent for \u201ccreative\u201d  . Local officials in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu are setting up a 200 million renminbi \u201centrepreneurship and innovation development fund\u201d and promising subsidies of up to 5 million renminbi. Officials in Guangdong province in China\u2019s south will cover part of a  \u2019s losses. Even the   city of Yingtan, in an area of Jiangxi province mainly known for its ancient Taoist temples, is planning to build an incubator. Hangzhou\u2019s government has been one of the more active. Officials are forming a venture capital fund of 4. 7 billion renminbi  with contributions from companies, according to the city\u2019s website. This year, Hangzhou announced that it would give 100 million renminbi annually to help   pay expenses. But governments historically have a spotty record of using   money to generate business success stories. During Japan\u2019s   decades, its bureaucrats tried to \u201cpick winners\u201d by selecting certain industries for support. Though they nurtured a few internationally competitive industries (shipbuilding and steel) they also had significant failures (chemicals and computer software). The Obama administration got a black eye for its financial aid to the solar technology firm Solyndra, which sank into bankruptcy. In China, government efforts to assist new businesses have often led to waste and excess. Too much investment pours into favored industries, spawning poorly conceived projects in areas like hotels and solar panels. By trying to spur   the state is also engaging in a   business that even for the most experienced venture capitalist is prone to produce more failures than successes. Hangzhou officials are trying to avoid such pitfalls. At Dream Town, the financial aid is often linked to a  \u2019s performance. The amount of free rent depends on how much private capital a company can raise. Cash handouts are tied to revenue targets or   apps. Government officials also enlist professionals to help allocate the city\u2019s money. The committee that judges applicants to Dream Town is usually made up of tech executives, financiers and academics. Ye Feng, a manager at another incubator who has sat as a judge on three occasions, said she quizzed the contenders on their technology, business plan and even product pricing. Usually about 30   appear at each competition. No more than four make the cut to enter Dream Town. \u201cThe competition is quite fierce,\u201d Ms. Ye said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to make a decision. \u201d But some in Hangzhou fear that the government is doling out too much money, and it is flowing to   with weak business plans and feeble prospects. Mr. Ai of Yun Ran said that two neighbors also received city subsidies. One, a robotics   failed to attract private capital and closed, while the other, a mobile game company, is struggling to stay afloat as its business withers. The government money, Mr. Ai said, often cannot replace the private capital necessary for  . \u201cWithout financing, it would be very hard for them to survive,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562312.344242}
