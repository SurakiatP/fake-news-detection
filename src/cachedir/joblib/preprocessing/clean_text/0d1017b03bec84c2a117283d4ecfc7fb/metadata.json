Steyn blamed the motivation for the incident on identity politics, which he argued has a \u201cdehumanizing\u201d effect and as long as identity politics remains part of the left\u2019s playbook, more of those types of incidents would occur in the future. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get a lot more of this stuff in the future because it is the logic of identity politics,\u201d Steyn said. \u201cIt is where identity politics leads. It is about ultimately the dehumanization that attends identity politics. \u201d \u201cThe minute you have identity groups  \u2014   the minute you have identity politics that what matters is whether people are black, or white, or gay, or straight, or transgendered, or cisgenerded, or Muslim, or infidel  \u2014   then you do not see the humanity in your fellow man,\u201d he continued. \u201cAll you see is the disfavored group and eventually you end with what happened in this situation. \u201d \u201cThere will be more of this in the future as long as the left is invested in identity politics as the organizing principle of society,\u201d he added. \u201cIdentity politics is a polite word. The actual term for what it is is a return to tribalism where don\u2019t see people as individuals equal before the law,   citizens, the   of others. What matters more and more is what group you belong to. This crime is ultimately where identity politics leads. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742562122.067594}
