Outfits relating to tragedy, controversy, or acts of violence are also inappropriate. \u2026 It is our mission to promote spaces that allow members of the Tufts community to have fun without feeling as though any part of their identity is being misrepresented or targeted. \\nIt then goes a step further and warns of the \u201cconsequences for wearing an offensive costume: \\nMary Pat McMahon, the Dean of Student Affairs, described the consequences as follows: \u201cThe range of response for students whose actions make others in our community feel threatened or unsafe, or who direct conduct towards others that is offensive or discriminatory, includes [Office of Equal Opportunity] and/or [Tufts University Police Department] investigation and then disciplinary sanctions from our office that could run a wide gamut depending on what is brought to our attention and the impact of these actions on others. Any complaints will result in full investigation by University officials and could result in serious disciplinary sanctions through Judicial Affairs.\u201d \\nOf course, this kind of totalitarian behavior is only possible if fellow students tell on each other . And that\u2019s exactly what they do. They encourage students to report someone wearing an \u201cinappropriate or offensive\u201d costume and provide a link to the school\u2019s \u201c bias reporting form .\u201d \\nThe letter was signed by the Inter Greek Council, Multicultural Greek Council, InterFraternity Council, and Panhellenic Council. It also reminds students to obtain consent before any sexual encounters during Halloween, citing a traditional increase in assaults during this time. \\nSchool officials insist that the students themselves wrote the letter and that the school does not have an official policy about Halloween costumes: \\n\u201cThe letter was written by students, for students, to encourage a thoughtful and considerate celebration of Halloween within our diverse and inclusive community and to stress the importance of alcohol safety and sexual consent,\u201d campus Spokesman Patrick Collins said. \u201cWe commend the leaders of our Greek Life councils for proactively raising these important issues with their fellow participants in Greek Life and encouraging responsible behavior. As is the case at any time, students whose actions are discriminatory or threaten others can face a range of disciplinary sanctions. Depending on their seriousness, such actions, when called to our attention, can prompt investigations by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, the Office of Equal Opportunity or, in certain circumstances, the Tufts University Police Department.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628513.525155}
