Law signed by Republican Governor Pat McCrory in March, has been blamed for hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses and the relocation of major sporting events from the ninth largest U.S. state. It prohibits transgender individuals from using the bathroom that fits the gender they identify with. Opponents of the law say the vote on Tuesday also could have national implications. If McCrory loses to Democratic challenger Roy Cooper, they said, elected officials backing such measures in other states will face greater political risk. Elections experts consider the race between McCrory and Cooper, one of 12 U.S. gubernatorial seats being decided on Tuesday, to be among the country's most competitive. LGBTQ advocacy groups say they are hopeful that a stronger message against the law will be sent on Election Day. Those that support the ban say they admire the incumbent Governor for his courage to stand up for your believes.\""}, "time": 1742628588.6994472}
