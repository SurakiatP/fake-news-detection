Skies were clear enough to see the purple mountains of Turkey a short distance across the Aegean Sea. It would be easy on this tranquil evening to catch calamari. These days, he needed a good haul to make ends meet. A year ago, he and other fishermen in the tiny village, Skala Sikaminias, were making a more unusual catch: thousands of   asylum seekers who streamed across the Aegean to escape conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. As one of the landfalls in Greece that is closest to Turkey, Skala Sikaminias, with its 100 residents, fast became ground zero for the crisis, the first stop in Europe for people trying to reach Germany in a desperate bid to start new lives. \u201cI\u2019d be in the middle of the sea, and I would see 50 boats zigzagging toward me,\u201d Mr. Valamios said, gazing across the narrow channel. \u201cI would speed toward them, and they would throw their children into my boat to be saved. \u201d Today the migrants have mostly stopped coming. The coastline, once littered with orange life vests and wrecked boats, has been cleaned to a   white. But the human drama has left an imprint here, and across all of Lesbos, in ways that have only begun to play out. The village is nearly empty of tourists this year as Germans, Swedes and other visitors who had long flocked to the crystalline waters of Lesbos go elsewhere, wary of spending their vacations in a place now associated with human desperation. Business at the island\u2019s hotels and tavernas has slumped around 80 percent, especially along the 7.  stretch between Skala Sikaminias and the vacation town of Molyvos, where many of the more than 800, 000 migrants who survived the crossing last year washed ashore. Mr. Valamios used to supplement his income as a fisherman by working five months of the year at Myrivilis\u2019 Mulberry taverna, facing the bucolic port where fishermen mend yellow nets beneath oleanders and village cats prowl for fish. This year, he was asked to work just one month amid a dearth of customers. Nearly 1, 000 Greeks in the area have lost seasonal employment. Among the villagers, there is a sense of incomprehension. When the refugee crisis started in earnest, many were thrust into the role of good Samaritans. With endless generosity, they banded together to rescue thousands of Syrians, Afghans and other migrants in peril, months before humanitarian aid groups and European governments arrived to help. \u201cThe whole village is proud of what we did,\u201d said Theano Laoumis, who helps run the To Kyma taverna. On the taverna\u2019s beach, refugee dinghies had landed in an unceasing stream. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know who to save first, there were so many people. But we did save them. It was only natural. That should bring good publicity, not bad. \u201d The drop in business has hit Lesbos as Greece has struggled to emerge from a lengthy economic crisis. Some are bitter that the refugee tide has added to their woes. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to come back,\u201d said Nikos Katakouzinos, a fisherman. \u201cThey\u2019ve done enough harm to the village and to the island. \u201d Yet most residents in Skala Sikaminias do not blame the migrants. Many locals are themselves descendants of Greek refugees who fled Turkey amid war with Greece in the 1920s. Today they are bewildered by criticism of Syrians and others escaping conflict and risking a perilous crossing of the Aegean, which also turned into a graveyard for more than 1, 000 men, women and children whose journeys ended in tragedy. Such images surface often from the collective memory of Skala Sikaminias, now that calm has returned and the Aegean is again a flat, clear expanse. On a recent evening, Mr. Valamios steered toward a lighthouse that many of the migrants aimed for as they neared the Greek shore from Turkey. One of his first rescues here was in 2009, before the crisis reached its apex. Refugees were already starting to come from the Middle East, and a plastic boat crammed with 20 people was sinking. He managed to rescue 10 the rest, children among them, slipped beneath the waves. \u201cBefore then, I didn\u2019t know what drowning was,\u201d said Mr. Valamios, a trim, pensive man. \u201cI realized that if you don\u2019t know how to swim, you sink like a stone. \u201d After Chancellor Angela Merkel said last year that Germany would welcome refugees, boats started swarming in by the thousands. The Greek government, in the midst of an economic and political crisis, was woefully unprepared. So the village fishermen sprang into action, racing toward waterlogged dinghies as screams echoed over the water. \u201cOur people were in shock  \u2014   there were so many babies,\u201d Mr. Valamios recalled. \u201cWe took the babies first, then returned for the adults. Often you didn\u2019t know if the children would wind up orphans. \u201d He paused, then clenched his jaw. \u201cWe saw many people die. \u201d The village soon set up a rescue system. If someone saw a migrant boat in trouble, he or she would alert the fishermen to head out. Residents gathered on shore to meet incoming boats and help survivors, who at one point numbered around 5, 000 a day. Women, led by village grandmothers, took the newcomers to a small house, where they dressed them in donated clothes and administered milk to babies. Yorgos Sofianis was among those stationed on the beach. He is a shepherd, his stable standing atop a hill where he could see the dinghies arriving. \u201cAt first, even my sheep were scared because of all the screams,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, like us, they got used to it. \u201d \u201cIt was a   situation,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe streets were paved with people. On some of the kids, you could see scars from the war back home. Even the biggest hater would change his heart if he saw that. \u201d Amid the chaos, Mr. Sofianis found a measure of salvation. His teenage son and daughter died recently of a rare form of epilepsy, over two successive Christmas Eves. \u201cOne night, a kid landed on the beach who looked so much like my dead son,\u201d he said. \u201cI turned away in tears. How much can a person take? At least that boy lived. \u201d He pursed his lips, and gazed sadly at the sea: \u201cThat\u2019s what saved me, helping these children. Because I couldn\u2019t help my own. \u201d By last July, more Coast Guard boats patrolled the waters, and nongovernmental organizations swarmed the area to help. Then, international news crews descended on the village, jostling for footage of the human drama. \u201cIt turned into a spectacle,\u201d Mr. Sofianis said. \u201cSometimes they would stop photographing and help the refugees, but many were just here for business. \u201d At the Mulberry taverna, Lefteris Stylianou, the owner, surveyed his   cafe and spoke bitterly of the aftermath. \u201cThey wanted to sell pain, when we gave our all to help,\u201d he said, referring to the news media. \u201cPlease, tell people that it\u2019s safe and beautiful here again. We need the tourism. \u201d As summer ebbs, the village is still struggling to return to normal. The healing seems a long time coming. The villagers no longer experience the sea in the same way. When they look at the horizon, some say they think for a split second that another refugee boat is coming. \u201cWe have to be ready,\u201d Mr. Valamios said. \u201cIf it happens again, everyone will do the exact same thing: We will help. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628514.3668442}
