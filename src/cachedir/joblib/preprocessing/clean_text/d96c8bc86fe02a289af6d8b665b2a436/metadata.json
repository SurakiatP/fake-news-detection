So what\u2019s going on? Is FBI Director Comey trying to save face, even at this late stage, having tarnished the reputation of the agency and himself. The fullness of time will show what he has in mind. He faces intense political pressure from key Democrat senators, demanding immediate answers about why he\u2019s reopening his investigation days before November\u2019s election, an unprecedented act. Senators Patrick Leahy, Dianne Feinstein, Thomas Carper and Ben Cardin wrote Comey, saying: \u201c(N)o later than Monday, 31 October 2016, we request you provide us with more detailed information about the investigative steps being taken, the number of emails involved, and what is being done to determine how many of the emails are duplicative of those already reviewed by the FBI.\u201d They want Attorney General Loretta Lynch explaining her involvement in Comey\u2019s action, if any. The Hillary campaign called for \u201cpublic answers\u201d to clarify what new information the FBI discovered. After saying that revisiting his decision last July would be unlikely, Comey opted for an October surprise \u2013 the likes of which Washington hasn\u2019t seen since the tumultuous end of Nixon\u2019s tenure. Paul Craig Roberts said he\u2019s gotten word \u201cthat the FBI has reopened the Hillary case of her violation of US National Security protocols, not because of the content of the new email releases, but because voter support for Trump seems to be overwhelming, while Hillary has cancelled appearances due to inability to muster a crowd. The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself.\u201d How remains to be seen. Like Roberts, I\u2019m puzzled. Washington power brokers chose Hillary to succeed Obama. Enormous resources, energy, corporate pollsters consistently showing her ahead, and one-sided scoundrel media support have gone into assuring it. Have things changed days before November 8? Are power brokers abandoning Hillary this late in the game? The last 48 hours have been breathtaking \u2013 the stuff Hollywood thrillers are made of. Will Hillary supporters blame Russia for Comey\u2019s action? One Democrat congressman suggested it. Will Comey be accused of being a Kremlin agent? However things unfold in the campaign\u2019s final days, Trump got a significant boost \u2013 whether enough for a \u201cmaster of suspense\u201d Alfred Hitchcock ending remains to be seen. My view, right or wrong, remains the same. After going all-out for Hillary throughout months of campaigning, it\u2019s hard believing power brokers decided otherwise this late in the game \u2013 unheard of in US electoral politics. At the same time, this political season has been unlike any I remember since the 1940s. Nothing ahead will surprise me. Submit your review'"}, "time": 1742562197.7990115}
