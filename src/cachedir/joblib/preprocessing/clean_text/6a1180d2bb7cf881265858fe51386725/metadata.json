One year ago, we all that that Donald Trump was just being funny, just being Trump, when he said that Hillary Clinton was showing poor judgement in letting Huma Abedin, wife of \u201cperf sleaze\u201d Anthony Weiner have access to government information. Trump called the couple a security risk, but again, we thought he was just making fun of them. As it turns out, Donald Trump\u2019s words were eerily prophetic. Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you have heard by now that the FBI is reopening the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email problems after finding evidence on devices at Anthony Weiner\u2019s home. Earlier, we reported that FBI Director James Comey had tricked Obama\u2019s Department of Justice and the Clintons in sending the investigation announcement letter to Congress. Some believe that Comey was attempting to force the DOJ to issue a warrant so that his agents can start reading the 10,000+ emails on Weiner\u2019s device. \\nHere Is How FBI Director Comey BAMBOOZLED The DOJ, CONGRESS, And The CLINTONS All At Once \\nNow, Anthony Weiner has spoken and he may have made Comey\u2019s job even easier, while completely bypassing the Department of Justice altogether. \\nAccording to reports, Weiner has given permission for the FBI to access all of the information on his electronic devices, including his wifi router. . @BretBaier emails Chris Wallace while he\u2019s on air: Weiner has given FBI permission to search computer so no warrant needed. @FoxNewsSunday \\n\u2014 Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) October 30, 2016 I emailed that 2 sources say Weiner is cooperating w/ FBI- & co-owned laptop. Also NY FBI had info 4 a few weeks- pressure was building https://t.co/AHbQVtvQzg \\n\u2014 Bret Baier (@BretBaier) October 30, 2016 \\nIn essence, Weiner is singing like a bird, and the FBI can conduct a thorough review of the emails in question. If there is criminality found on Weiner\u2019s devices, they have a shot at it. \\nIs there anything that the Department of Justice or the Clintons can do? \\nTime will tell, but many believe that WikiLeaks and others are about to drop more incriminating evidence on Hillary later this week. \\nComey may have saved himself. Weiner may be trying to cut a plea deal to save himself. \\nHang on, as this ride is still picking up steam! Related Items'"}, "time": 1742564506.4104705}
