The United States called an urgent meeting of the Council on Tuesday to discuss the grievance, making Iran the subject of the first diplomatic skirmish at the United Nations by Nikki R. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who is Mr. Trump\u2019s new ambassador. \u201cThe United States is not na\u00efve,\u201d she told reporters after the closed meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stand by. You\u2019re going to see us call them out as we said we would, and you are also going to see us act accordingly. \u201d Ms. Haley took no questions after her Security Council debut and proposed nothing concrete. The council agreed to refer the issue to its own sanctions committee for further inquiry, which is what it did last year after the last missile test by Iran. Iran has not confirmed that it conducted a test. But Mr. Zarif, at a joint news conference in Tehran with his visiting counterpart from France,   Ayrault, said he hoped that the new American administration would not use Iran\u2019s military defenses \u201cas a pretext to create new tensions. \u201d When the nuclear deal with Iran was reached in 2015 with major powers including the United States, they agreed sanctions on Iran would be relaxed in exchange for its verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work. A Security Council resolution \u201ccalled upon\u201d Iran not to undertake any tests of missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Iran contends that it has not violated the resolution and that its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear warheads  \u2014   which it already has promised not to make as part of the nuclear accord. Nonetheless, the American and Israeli accusations have created what amounts to an early test of the Trump administration\u2019s toughness on Iran. During the presidential election campaign, Mr. Trump denounced the nuclear agreement and sometimes conflated it with the Iranian missile program. Arms control experts have cautioned that Iran\u2019s missile tests are not prohibited under the nuclear accord. Ms. Haley used tough words about such tests but did not say whether her administration regarded them as a violation of the accord. \u201cWe have said with this administration that we are not going to show a blind eye to these things that happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to act. We\u2019re going to be strong. We\u2019re going to be loud and we\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to protect the American people and the people across the world. \u201d Iran\u2019s United Nations mission added to Mr. Zarif\u2019s warning, issuing a Foreign Ministry statement asserting that Iranian ballistic missiles are \u201cexclusively for legitimate defense. \u201d The statement said missile tests \u201care an integral component\u201d of Iran\u2019s   and that \u201cwe reject politically motivated comments regarding Iran\u2019s missile program. \u201d Mr. Zarif also used the news conference on Tuesday to emphasize Iran\u2019s anger over the Trump administration\u2019s executive order on Friday suspending refugee admissions and prohibiting the issuance of visas to Iran and six other   countries. Mr. Zarif called the order \u201ca shameful act. \u201d The order has upended the lives of thousands of Iranians, who are by far the largest population affected among the seven countries, which also include Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Iran\u2019s government has pledged a reciprocal response to the order. Mr. Ayrault told reporters at the news conference that France had \u201cexpressed its concern\u201d over Iran\u2019s missile tests, according to an account by Agence  . Earlier, upon Mr. Ayrault\u2019s arrival in Tehran, Iranian news media quoted him as saying the Trump administration\u2019s order on refugees and visas amounted to \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and should be revoked.'"}, "time": 1742561920.195384}
