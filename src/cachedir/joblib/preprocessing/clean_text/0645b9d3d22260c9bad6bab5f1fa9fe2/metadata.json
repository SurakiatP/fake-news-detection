[The Valparaiso, Indiana, YMCA issued a statement to members that the cable news network was removed from facility TVs because too many members complained about the programing.  Debra Koeppen, the YMCA\u2019s chief development officer, said that \u201cTrying to please everyone\u201d is the \u201cNo. 1 problem we have in the wellness area,\u201d according to Chicago Tribune reporter Jerry Davich, who claims to be a member of the YMCA in question. Earlier this week, Robert Wanek, CEO of the Valparaiso YMCA, sent a message to members saying, \u201cIn order to eliminate perceived political bias associated with national news outlets, the Valparaiso Family YMCA will only be showing local news channels in the future. \u201d Davich asked the CEO to reveal more details about the removal of CNN from the TVs, but Wanek replied, \u201cI cannot pinpoint the change origins, only to add that we get dozens of requests to change channels every day from numerous interest groups. \u201d \u201cWe just want the Y to be a haven for wellness where people come together and have a sense of belonging, gain new relationships and achieve their personal goals,\u201d Wanek added. \u201cWe will display local news moving forward. \u201d Indeed, Wanek said that from this point forward only local news will be played on the TVs and all cable news networks will be banned. Reporter Davich\u2019s article was far from a straight report on the matter, however. The reporter was an open detractor of the decision to remove CNN from the TVs, clearly stating he and some other members disagreed with the new policy. Davich insisted that CNN was a centrist network and noted that \u201cnone\u201d of the members he talked to \u201cagreed with the removal of CNN. \u201d The reporter gave readers his opinion in the very first sentence, saying, \u201cIs the Valparaiso Family YMCA simply exercising its right to appease as many members as possible, or is the new Donald   America already flexing its muscles?\u201d Davich\u2019s final say on the matter was just as clear. As he wrapped up his story. the reporter complained that \u201cthe Y\u2019s decision to remove all national news outlets from its televisions says more about its leaders than its members. You\u2019d think this story would be just another example of fake news. Sadly, it\u2019s not. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742561761.043601}
