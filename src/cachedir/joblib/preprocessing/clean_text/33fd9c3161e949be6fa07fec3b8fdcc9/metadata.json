C.  \u2014   Edward \u201cNed\u201d Price, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst who said he resigned last week because of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cdisturbing\u201d actions and that his \u201cdecision had nothing to do with politics,\u201d donated thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2016 presidential campaign. [\u201cTo be clear, my decision had nothing to do with politics, and I would have been proud to again work under a Republican administration open to intelligence analysis,\u201d Price wrote in an   he penned for the Washington Post Monday. He added, \u201cAs intelligence professionals, we\u2019re taught to tune out politics\u201d and noted that \u201cDespite working proudly for Republican and Democratic presidents, I reluctantly concluded that I cannot in good faith serve this administration as an intelligence professional. \u201d  Price suggested his decision emanated from President Trump\u2019s \u201cdisturbing\u201d actions. However, public records indicate Price has been listed as a registered Democrat in D. C. since 2008. Further, Federal Election Commission (FEC) records show that Price donated thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. These records indicate that on August 21, 2016, he made two donations to Clinton\u2019s campaign. Price donated $2, 300 to the DNC\u2019s Hillary Victory Fund and another $2, 700 to Hillary For America. According to NPR, \u201cThe Hillary Victory Fund is a joint fundraising committee for Hillary for America, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic committees of 32 states and Puerto Rico. \u201d However, Price\u2019s deep ties to the Democratic Party reach back over 15 years. According to his LinkedIn profile, Price campaigned for Dallas\u2019s former Democratic Mayor Ron Kirk in his unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 2002. Kirk lost to   Attorney General, Sen. John Cornyn ( ). Then, in November 2013, Price contributed $250 to Massachusetts Democrat Seth Moulton in his bid for Congress, according to FEC records. In his   Price also attempted to echo rhetoric from the left alleging Trump\u2019s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon was \u201ca media champion of white nationalism. \u201d Those false smears have repeatedly been discredited by individuals from all over the political spectrum.
