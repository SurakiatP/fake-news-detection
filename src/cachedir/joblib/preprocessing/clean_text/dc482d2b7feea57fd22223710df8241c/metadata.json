Trump edged away on Thursday from his dismissive stance on American assessments of Russian hacking, saying he would meet with intelligence officials next week \u201cto be updated on the facts\u201d after the Obama administration announced sanctions against Moscow. In a brief written statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s first response to President Obama\u2019s sweeping action against Russia, the   reiterated his call for \u201cour country to move on to bigger and better things. \u201d But he said that, \u201cin the interest of our country and its great people,\u201d he would get the briefing \u201cnevertheless. \u201d The statement to some extent echoed his remarks late Wednesday, when he was asked at his    estate about Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to take action against Russia. In otherwise opaque comments, Mr. Trump appeared to concede the need to make computers more secure. \u201cI think we ought to get on with our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on. We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but I\u2019m not sure we have the kind, the security we need. \u201d Mr. Trump took questions Wednesday from a handful of reporters as Don King, the sports promoter and a longtime friend, stood next to him. He has not held a formal news conference since July, though he promised on Wednesday to hold one in early January. The   has bucked the consensus of his own party in Congress in repeatedly expressing skepticism that Russia was behind hacking during the election. His isolation was underscored by other Republicans\u2019 responses to the Obama administration\u2019s actions. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Thursday that the sanctions were \u201coverdue,\u201d but still blamed Mr. Obama for \u201ceight years of failed policy with Russia. \u201d \u201cRussia does not share America\u2019s interests,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. \u201d Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina went further, saying they would push Congress for even stronger sanctions than Mr. Obama was seeking. That is a direct challenge to Mr. Trump and his advisers, who mocked intelligence agencies this month for their conclusion that Russia was responsible for the hacking. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s just another excuse,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Dec. 11. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. \u201d He linked the intelligence assessments on Russia to Democrats\u2019 embarrassment over their loss to him. Mr. Trump has also voiced his doubts several times on Twitter. In one post, he asked, \u201cIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?\u201d In another, he asserted that \u201cunless you catch \u2018hackers\u2019 in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. \u201d In the posts, Mr. Trump wrongly asserted that the United States government had waited until after the election to accuse Russia. In fact, the administration announced in October that it believed Russia had been involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the leaking of the organization\u2019s emails. Mr. Trump was asked on Wednesday about statements by Mr. Graham that the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, should be personally penalized for the hacking. The   said he was unaware of the comments by Mr. Graham, who was a Republican candidate for president before dropping out a year ago. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cAs you know, he ran against me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561826.7338457}
