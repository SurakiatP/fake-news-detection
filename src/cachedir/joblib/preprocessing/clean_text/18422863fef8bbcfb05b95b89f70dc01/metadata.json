At a previously scheduled meeting in Tokyo, the foreign ministers of the three nations  \u2014   China, Japan and South Korea  \u2014   criticized the missile test, which appeared to demonstrate a significant advance in North Korea\u2019s efforts to build a    means to strike American and allied forces. The missile flew 310 miles toward Japan, much farther than previous tests. Tensions between the three countries have risen in recent months: Chinese vessels have repeatedly entered disputed waters surrounding a group of   islands in the East China Sea, setting off protests from Japan. Tokyo opposed a visit this month by South Korean lawmakers to islands both nations claims. And China has harshly criticized South Korea\u2019s agreement to host an   advanced missile defense system that the Chinese believe could be used against their missiles. But North Korea\u2019s missile launch briefly united the three other nations on Wednesday. \u201cIf there was a silver lining, it would be the fact that it provided the three an opportunity to have something in common, which is rare,\u201d said J. Berkshire Miller, an international affairs fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations. If the North Korean threat is to be truly defused, experts say, the three East Asian neighbors will need more common ground. \u201cWe all know that on days when North Korea doesn\u2019t test missiles, tensions may be above the surface,\u201d said Scott A. Snyder, senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cBut longer term, if you\u2019re looking for conditions that would suggest real stability in the region, that is the sort of cooperation that would be needed. \u201d The latest missile test came two days after the United States and South Korea kicked off their annual joint military exercises. North Korea condemns all such drills as rehearsals for an invasion, and it has often responded with warlike words, or with missile tests. At a news conference in Tokyo on Wednesday, Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, said North Korea\u2019s action \u201cis simply not tolerated. \u201d His South Korean counterpart, Yun   said the three countries \u201cconfirmed our common view that we must deter North Korea\u2019s further provocative actions. \u201d Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, said, \u201cChina opposes the development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, and any words or deeds that create tensions in the peninsula. \u201d He also reiterated China\u2019s opposition to American efforts to build the missile defense system in South Korea. Chinese commentators argued that the United States was partly to blame for the North\u2019s aggressive behavior. An opinion article published on Wednesday by the Chinese   news agency Xinhua, denounced the United States and its allies for \u201crisking turning the region into a powder keg. \u201d \u201c  leads to nowhere but a more anxious, more agitating and thus more unpredictable Pyongyang,\u201d the commentary said. Still, on social media in China, many posts placed the blame squarely on Kim   the North Korean leader, describing him as an erratic and untrustworthy leader and urging the government to do more to rein him in. President Park   of South Korea also denounced the North Korean leader in remarks during a visit to a   military unit on Wednesday. \u201cGiven the fact that North Korea has an irrational   system under a   dictatorship,\u201d Ms. Park said, \u201cand that Kim   is an unpredictable character, there is a high possibility that this threat could become a reality. \u201d The latest North Korean provocation comes at a time when Japan, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is debating its military future after roughly 70 years of pacifism mandated by a postwar Constitution that was largely written by American occupiers. Already last year, Mr. Abe pushed through a series of security laws that permit Japan\u2019s   forces to participate in overseas combat. On Wednesday, as Mr. Abe denounced the North Korean missile launch as an \u201can unforgivable act of violence,\u201d his newly appointed defense minister, Tomomi Inada, said Japanese forces would begin training for overseas missions, including rescuing captured troops from peacekeeping missions. Setsu Kobayashi, a law professor emeritus at Keio University and the leader of a group that opposes the security bills passed last year, called the new training drills a \u201chistoric turning point\u201d and a violation of the country\u2019s Constitution. \u201cNow people outside of Japan will question if Japan can become a country that can wage war,\u201d Mr. Kobayashi said. But other analysts said that the Japanese, who mostly opposed the security laws passed after a  parliamentary struggle last year, might start to accept the incremental escalation of military activity that Mr. Abe is pushing. \u201cThe more that there are dangers in the neighborhood  \u2014   a rising China, a threatening North Korea  \u2014   that puts wind in Abe\u2019s sails,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, the director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo. Ultimately, Mr. Abe wants to revise the pacifist clause in the Constitution. But the public  \u2014   as well as members of Parliament, including some in Mr. Abe\u2019s governing coalition  \u2014   would most likely oppose him. \u201cEven with this more threatening environment, it\u2019s not going to be easy at all,\u201d Mr. Kingston said. \u201cThere is a deeply embedded attachment to the peace Constitution as part of Japanese national identity. \u201d Mr. Abe, Mr. Kingston added, \u201cunderstands that he has a deep hole to climb out of to try to convince the public that that is necessary. \u201d Public reaction in Japan to the North Korean missile test was relatively subdued, although several politicians strongly protested it.. Hideaki Omura, the governor of Aichi Prefecture in central Japan, which includes the city of Nagoya, said on Twitter that the missile launch was a \u201cgrave provocation. \u201d Renho Murata, a member of the upper house of Parliament and a candidate to lead the opposition Democratic Party, said she \u201cfirmly protested\u201d North Korea\u2019s action. The significance of North Korea\u2019s missile launch may take some time to sink in, as the Japanese have become somewhat accustomed to the missile tests. \u201cFor Japanese people, the picture of the Chinese vessels surrounding the Senkakus is more shocking,\u201d said Tsuneo Watanabe, a senior fellow at the Tokyo Foundation, a research group, referring to the Chinese incursions around the disputed islands in the East China Sea. The North Korean missile launches, Mr. Watanabe said, sometimes \u201clook like animation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563694.3124192}
