Trump announced a major staff   last week, for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign team to settle on a new buzzword. \u201cHe peddles conspiracy theories,\u201d her campaign manager, Robby Mook, said of Mr. Trump on MSNBC. \u201cWe hear rehashed conspiracy theories,\u201d he added moments later. \u201cHe doubled down on this today,\u201d Mr. Mook said, wrapping up, \u201cby appointing someone to lead his campaign who makes these conspiracy theories basically his professional mission. \u201d For the better part of two decades, the invocation of a \u201cvast   conspiracy\u201d against the Clintons, as Mrs. Clinton famously called it when allegations of sexual misconduct engulfed her husband\u2019s administration, has elicited eye rolls even among some of the couple\u2019s allies. It was not worth amplifying such attacks by responding to them, advisers often reasoned. And any discussion of a secret plot to undercut the Clintons risked sounding like paranoia, peevishness or just an attempt to duck responsibility. But with Mr. Trump\u2019s appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart News, as his new campaign chief, Mrs. Clinton and her extended orbit have sensed an unfamiliar opportunity: The   vast   conspiracy might actually be lending her a hand. For longtime Clinton allies, the elevation of Mr. Bannon has inspired competing emotions. There is a sense of vindication, bordering on the surreal  \u2014   a     impulse that cannot be suppressed as purveyors of conspiracy theories seize the reins of an actual Republican presidential campaign. \u201cShe was right that there were these dark forces at work that were trained on her and her husband,\u201d said Lissa Muscatine, a friend of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s and longtime chief speechwriter. \u201cThe extent of it didn\u2019t really add up for people at the time, but maybe now it does. \u201d Yet after more than two decades of attacks from conservatives  \u2014   some seizing on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own missteps, her former aides say, but most generally groundless  \u2014   others worry that an even darker turn is possible, given the advisers now guiding Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. In addition to Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump is relying on the advice of Roger Ailes, the founder and recently ousted chairman of Fox News, and Roger J. Stone Jr. whose 2015 book, \u201cThe Clintons\u2019 War on Women,\u201d accused Mrs. Clinton of being a lesbian, shaming her husband\u2019s sexual accusers and playing a role in the death of Vincent W. Foster Jr. the deputy White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993. \u201cThis is beyond anything anyone even thought about in their worst nightmare,\u201d Mickey Kantor, a longtime Clinton family friend who was the United States trade representative and secretary of commerce under President Bill Clinton, said of the new conservative coterie around Mr. Trump. David Brock, an ardent defender of Mrs. Clinton, said, \u201cThe conspirators of the \u201990s were a ragtag bunch operating in secrecy and as a fringe subset of the conservative movement. \u201d Mr. Brock, a charter member of that \u201cragtag bunch\u201d before having a political conversion, added, \u201cToday\u2019s equivalent is more a conglomerate than a conspiracy. \u201d Indeed, Mr. Bannon\u2019s website  \u2014   which had over 18. 3 million unique visitors in July, according to data from comScore  \u2014   has featured stories about the \u201c  code\u201d in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s language suggested that Khizr Khan, who criticized Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention and whose son, an Army captain, was killed in Iraq, should blame Mrs. Clinton for his son\u2019s death and said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team was straining to highlight \u201cwhatever scraps of humanity can be found in her soulless,   heart. \u201d And as Mr. Trump has raised questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health, saying she \u201clacks the mental and physical stamina\u201d to fight terrorism, Breitbart has amplified those claims. \u201cBizarre behavior, seizure allegations raise doubts about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health,\u201d read one headline last week. \u201cClinton crash,\u201d began another, with a video of her briefly stumbling while on stage with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. On Sunday, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and a prominent and vocal Trump supporter, joined in, saying on Fox News that voters should \u201cgo online and put down \u2018Hillary Clinton illness,\u2019 take a look at the videos for yourself. \u201d The theme is familiar to veterans of the Clinton circle. \u201cThey\u2019ve always had that \u2018Hillary\u2019s dying!\u2019 \u201d said James Carville, Mr. Clinton\u2019s chief strategist in the 1992 election. Clinton aides said their playbook called for a careful balancing act: ignoring or dismissing Mr. Trump\u2019s most outlandish attacks, while also encouraging independent   at mainstream news outlets to debunk any that threaten to gain traction. So as insinuations about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health began to spread from conservative websites like the Drudge Report into Mr. Trump\u2019s own speeches and Twitter messages, her campaign released a statement from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s internist, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, vouching for her \u201cexcellent health\u201d and providing a summary of her medical history. With Mr. Trump replaying the 1990s, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s friends and advisers say, she cannot help but revert to a war room mentality, making her eager to fight back aggressively at some of the allegations against her. \u201cShe can dismiss Fox News or Breitbart, but this is her opponent now,\u201d said Patti Solis Doyle, who worked for Mrs. Clinton from 1991 to 2008. \u201cThey\u2019re just going to have to weaponize, contrast with him, respond to attacks. \u201d Not all attacks are equal. Those close to Mrs. Clinton pointed to the   birther questions about President Obama\u2019s birth certificate, led by none other than Mr. Trump: Mr. Obama, they said, may have inadvertently fueled those questions by initially resisting a forceful public rebuke. \u201cIt almost gave it credibility to respond, but at some point you have to,\u201d Paul Begala, a top strategist for Mr. Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, said of calls for Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate. Theories aside, Mrs. Clinton must tread carefully in blaming Mr. Trump and his allies in the conservative news media for all of her political problems. After all, early questions about Mr. Clinton\u2019s relationship with a White House intern prompted Mrs. Clinton, then first lady, to suggest the existence of a \u201cvast   conspiracy\u201d in a 1998 interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show. But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s claim was not entirely baseless: Amid a congressional investigation, she and her husband learned of a small team of lawyers who had worked in secret to bolster a sexual misconduct lawsuit by Paula Jones, helping to push the case into the office of the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr. Mr. Starr later expanded his investigation to include the Monica Lewinsky affair. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides evidently see an opening to dismiss Mr. Trump, and his more   attacks, as simply part of \u201ca   network of conspiracy peddlers,\u201d as one news release put it last week. Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief strategist and pollster, observed that the most effective political attacks were always rooted in truth and delivered by credible sources. \u201cDo his attacks start losing credibility, particularly the more outrageous ones?\u201d Mr. Benenson asked. \u201cThey may have some trouble, considering the source. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564042.892833}
