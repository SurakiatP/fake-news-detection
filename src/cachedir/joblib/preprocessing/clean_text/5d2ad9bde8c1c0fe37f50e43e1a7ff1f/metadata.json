Mr. Le Pen was expelled from the Front National by his daughter as she reformed it into a moderate, populist movement. \u201c[In 2002] a Republican front had come together to make the Front National score as low as possible,\u201d wrote Robl\u00e9do. \u201c[Again] we have to vote massively so that [Marine Le Pen] does not win the presidential election. \u201d Anticipating criticism of his intervention as an abuse of his public position, the professor concluded by saying that \u201c[Sometimes] the values of a man\u2019s life take precedence over all other considerations.
