[The network announced its schedule Sunday, kicking off the annual week where broadcasters outline next season\u2019s plans to advertisers. NBC is the second most popular network behind CBS, first among the younger viewers it covets, and is bullish on next year since it will show the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl.  The comedy \u201cWill  Grace,\u201d which originally aired from 1998 to 2006, unites its original ensemble of Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally with the original creative team. If the resumption goes well, NBC hopes there will be more than the 12 episodes now on order, said Robert Greenblatt, NBC entertainment chairman. \u201cWill  Grace\u201d will kick off Thursday\u2019s lineup, followed by \u201cGreat News,\u201d a sophomore comedy produced by Tina Fey. Greenblatt said Fey will appear periodically on air next season, too. The key to reestablishing Thursday nights, which NBC dominated during the 1980s and 1990s, is bringing the fans who made \u201cThis is Us\u201d the year\u2019s biggest new hit, to that night at 9 p. m. The show also gets the   slot after next winter\u2019s Super Bowl. Greenblatt sounded conflicted about how much NBC will push the \u201c  TV\u201d concept promotionally. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to be emblazoned with   letters atop the Empire State Building, but we\u2019re going to use it,\u201d he said. NBC will introduce eight new series next season but sprinkle them throughout the year. Only the \u201cWill  Grace\u201d reboot, a Dick   limited series on the Menendez murders and \u201cThe Brave,\u201d an action series starring Anne Heche as an undercover military hero, will begin in the fall. Doing it that way illustrates the elastic nature of broadcast television, when shows drop on and off the schedule throughout the year, and the goal is to reduce repeats. As a result, Greenblatt wouldn\u2019t say when the other five new series will appear. Some established shows, like \u201cChicago Med\u201d and \u201cLittle Big Shots\u201d were renewed but don\u2019t have announced spots on the schedule yet. The     nature of TV will be a barrier for NBC: the Thursday schedule it hopes becomes dominant will be   for pro football in the fall and the Winter Olympics. NBC said it was offered \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which rival ABC announced it was bringing back next season. NBC said the strength of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d which will add former \u201cIdol\u201d stars Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson as coaches next year, and its other development led it to say no, thanks. \u201cThe audience didn\u2019t tell us there was a compelling reason to bring it back, either,\u201d said Paul Telegdy, president of NBC\u2019s alternative and reality series. NEW SERIES, Other new series ordered by NBC:  \u2014  \u201cGood Girls,\u201d a drama about three suburban moms who rob the local supermarket. It\u2019s described as a mix between \u201cThelma  Louise\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d  \u2014  \u201cReverie,\u201d a thriller about a former hostage negotiator brought on to save people lost in a virtual reality program,  \u2014  \u201cRise,\u201d a drama starring Josh Radnor as a teacher who revives a lackluster high school theater department,  \u2014  \u201cA. P. Bio,\u201d a comedy produced by Lorne Michaels and Seth Meyers about a philosophy scholar who goes to work teaching biology in high school,  \u2014  \u201cChampions,\u201d a Mindy   series about a gym owner and his brother who must cope with a new   in the household. ___, NEVER CAN SAY GOODBYE, After first announcing the cancellation of the time travel series \u201cTimeless,\u201d NBC bowed to fan complaints and said it would bring the freshman series back. NBC also didn\u2019t include some other series in its order for next season  \u2014   \u201cChicago Justice,\u201d \u2033Trial  Error\u201d and \u201cThe Carmichael Show\u201d  \u2014   but Greenblatt said that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re dead. ___, \u201cNEW GIRL\u201d There\u2019s good news and bad news for fans of the Zooey Deschanel\u2019s Fox series \u201cNew Girl. \u201d Fox, which will present its schedule Monday, announced a day in advance that the series will be back for a seventh season  \u2014   but that will be its last.'"}, "time": 1742564160.8471775}
