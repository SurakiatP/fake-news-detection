But either way, it is clear that she has, through her campaigns and career, helped create a political environment in which a woman could come so close to winning the presidency. What is less known is that Mrs. Clinton started changing that political culture for women as far back as the early 1970s  \u2014   not through a candidacy of her own, but through a series of small, but crucial, networking moves. The number of women who labored in basement meetings, in   groups, in boardrooms, in unions, in news organizations and in their own kitchens to expand possibilities for women are far too many to count. Far fewer, however, worked specifically to put women into elected office. Prominent among those who did were a few key friends of Mrs. Clinton whom she helped find paths to the cause, including a Texan political player named Betsey Wright, who Mrs. Clinton introduced to a classmate of hers from Wellesley College, Jan Piercy. \u201cIn 1972, I was working at a temporary job at Filene\u2019s Basement, trying to figure out what I was going to do next, when I got a call from Hillary,\u201d recalled Ms. Piercy, who had devoted herself to antipoverty work at Wellesley, but not to feminism, per se. \u201cAnd Hillary said, \u2018We have to go to Washington tomorrow.\u2019 So we jumped on a plane, and I\u2019m ushered in to the National League of Women Voters headquarters, and Hillary tells them, \u2018This can be your youth director. \u2019\u201d Ms. Piercy, representing the league, went on to attend the Republican and Democratic conventions in 1972, a key inflection point for female activists. \u201cWe realized that the only way we could be accepted as equals was to be in office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the parties were not interested in cultivating women. So we realized we would have to train them ourselves. \u201d Ms. Piercy was too inexperienced to do that so was Elisabeth Griffith, another friend of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s and Ms. Piercy\u2019s from Wellesley, who had joined Ms. Piercy in the early stages of a project with that ambition. But while Mrs. Clinton was a law student supporting the presidential candidate Senator George McGovern in San Antonio, she met Ms. Wright, the person she thought could galvanize and prepare potential female candidates. She soon became close to Ms. Wright, a seasoned political operative whose experience of sexism on the McGovern campaign was having a somewhat radicalizing effect on her. Often when Ms. Wright tried to raise an issue with a male staff member on the campaign, \u201cIt elicited some kind of crazy response about hormones,\u201d Ms. Wright, now 73, recalled. \u201cI was already a feminist, but that turned me into a raving feminist. I would go home and play Helen Reddy and go to sleep. \u201d Bill Clinton, who helped coordinate McGovern\u2019s Texas campaign, had his own feminist aha moment while working on the race, when McGovern\u2019s staff did not pursue Mrs. Clinton for a job for which Mr. Clinton had recommended her. \u201cBut she\u2019s better than me,\u201d he told Ms. Piercy at the time. In meeting Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Wright said, she no longer just imagined a woman could be president, but believed she had met the very woman who would first reach that milestone. Many friends tried to talk Hillary out of marrying Bill for the sake of her political future Ms. Wright went so far as to try to talk Bill out of marrying Hillary, for the sake of the feminist cause. \u201cI told him it was always going to be a struggle for her to carve her own political direction,\u201d Ms. Wright said. Ms. Wright had previously worked on individual women\u2019s campaigns. Yet it was Mrs. Clinton who suggested that Ms. Wright move to Washington to spread her expertise, by joining Ms. Piercy and Ms. Griffith to work for what would become known as the National Women\u2019s Education Fund, an unofficial training arm of the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus, with no formal affiliation. \u201cHillary was saying they really did need to get somebody who understood local races,\u201d Ms. Wright said. \u201cAnd she strongly urged me to go. \u201d It was not an easy sell: Mrs. Clinton was asking Ms. Wright, a Texan, to move to Washington for a job that did not yet have the funding to support it. But persuaded by Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Wright ultimately accepted the position of executive director, backed by a national board of women working in politics. Ms. Wright recalled driving around a frigid Midwest in the winter of 1973, \u201csleeping in bunk beds at Y. W. C. A. s, with the bathroom down the hall,\u201d trying to recruit women from local churches, gardening clubs and political caucuses for seminars and training sessions that Ms. Wright created to teach women how to maneuver within the political process. She also formed a powerful partnership with Ruth Mandel, who had recently created the pioneering Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. It was not just that they needed to train women, Ms. Mandel said they needed to \u201chelp women overcome their own resistance to gaining political power in their own right. \u201d Ms. Wright knew that revolutions start with pragmatics: She created a training manual that the Education Fund and the Political Caucus relied on heavily for years, a guidebook that broke down the logistics of opinion polling, reaching the news media and recruiting a staff. The training sessions offered advice on every aspect of campaigning, including details specific to women. \u201cWe told them, \u2018Put your name tag high up on your right lapel, so people could see your name without staring at your chest,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Griffith, who was associate director under Ms. Wright. They also told women, Ms. Wright remembered, \u201cNever to say anything in a ladies\u2019 bathroom you don\u2019t want to see in a newspaper. \u201d Vivian Houghton, now a    Democratic political activist in Delaware, attended a training session in the  \u201970s that gave her the confidence, she said, to run several women\u2019s campaigns at the state and local level. Eventually, in 2005, she ran for attorney general of Delaware, for the Green party. \u201cFrom that training, we carried out a message that women were just as competent or even more competent than men to run for office,\u201d Ms. Houghton said. \u201cAnd it gave us the instructions on how to do it, because we were at that point completely uneducated about it. \u201d Judith Lichtman, a senior adviser to the National Partnership for Women and Families, recalled that in 1974, \u201cthe N. W. E. F. was already an important presence on the scene. \u201d She credited Ms. Wright for that: \u201cShe turned the glimmer of an idea into an institution that catapulted untold numbers of women into public life. \u201d But she credits Mrs. Clinton with pairing the right political powerhouse with the right cause. \u201cShe had a   moment,\u201d Ms. Lichtman said. \u201cThat was pretty early for that light bulb  \u2014   not a lot of people were thinking about women in politics. \u201d Ms. Wright\u2019s political talents were such that she became the chief of staff for Bill Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas. \u201cIn the Capitol, you had to go through Betsey if you wanted to drink a glass of water,\u201d said Sara Ehrman, the Clinton friend who famously drove Hillary Rodham to Arkansas. But the role Ms. Wright played in Mr. Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential primary has largely overshadowed the work for which she was once well recognized within the women\u2019s movement. It fell to Ms. Wright, the proud,   raving feminist, to squelch what she once called, dismissively, the \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d that threatened to derail Mr. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIt was my job to defend the Arkansas record and Bill Clinton personally,\u201d Ms. Wright said. As for the derogatory phase she coined, she said, \u201cThat was just a brain freeze, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ll go to my grave regretting I ever said. \u201d The race \u201ctore Betsey apart,\u201d said Ms. Piercy, who saw that her friend\u2019s role was significantly limited once the campaign team made it past the primary. \u201cBetsey was there in the beating heart of a   presidential campaign, before we fully understood exactly what it meant for women to be in the cross hairs of that kind of power,\u201d Ms. Piercy said. Ms. Wright is still hopeful that a Democratic woman will be elected president in her lifetime. Certainly, the prospect is far from the pipe dream it seemed like when she first met Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI told Hillary I thought she could be president,\u201d Ms. Wright said. \u201cShe would just laugh. Back then, it was pie in the sky. \u201d Out of politics for years, Ms. Wright is now contemplating ways she could once again engage in causes in Texas, where she has been dismayed by, among other things, the state\u2019s decision to ban Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. \u201cI have to do something,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to create a sense of outrage  \u2014   to get more women elected, and to scare the hell out of the men who are there. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628575.362564}
