Unions are working hard to destroy it in the public sector and they are doing a damn fine job thanks to help from lunatic Democrats. \\nFrom Grabien : \\nSpeaking at a Labor Day rally in Hampton, Ill., today Hillary Clinton threatened to imprison employers for \u201cwage theft.\u201d \\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to enforcing labor laws,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure that some employers go to jail for wage theft and all the other abuses that they engage in.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd we are going to make it harder and harder to stop what should be the right of every American: to join a union and bargain collectively through that union,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut, I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019ve got a fight on our hands.\u201d \\nWhat is she talking about when she mentions \u2018wage theft\u2019 and how is she going to jail employers because of it? How will this help the economy? The only \u2018wage theft\u2019 that happens in the United States is by the government in the form of taxes. \\nThe woman is clearly out of her collective mind. She continues to talk about Obama mandating federal contractor provide 7 paid sick days a year to their employees. This is more days than a majority of private sector business offer across the country. Benefits are between an employer and employee. It\u2019s not up to the government to mandate them. \\nMake no mistake, just like with most Democrats, Clinton is on board with killing more jobs and hurting small businesses. All while lying through her teeth about wanting to \u2018help them.\u2019 \\nYou\u2019ve got to watch the video here:'"}, "time": 1742563158.9515197}
