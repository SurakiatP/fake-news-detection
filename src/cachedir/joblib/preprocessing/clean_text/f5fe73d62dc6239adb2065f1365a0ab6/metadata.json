We could respond.\u201d \\nThe Admiral Kuznetsov can carry dozens of fighter bombers and helicopters. It has been sailing for the past week from Russia to the Mediterranean. \\nThe BBC\u2019s Jonathan Marcus reports from Brussels that the battle group is currently at anchor off the North African coast and taking on fuel. \\nThe group has two \u201coilers\u201d (tankers) with it and it is not clear which of the vessels is actually refuelling, he adds. \\nThe Russian embassy in Madrid formally withdrew a request to Spain for refuelling after being approached by the Spanish foreign ministry. \\n\u201cGiven the information which appeared on the possibility that these ships would participate in supporting military action in the Syrian city of Aleppo, the ministry of foreign affairs requested clarification from the embassy of the Russian Federation in Madrid,\u201d the Spanish foreign ministry had said on Wednesday in a statement to the BBC. \\nIt added that permission had been granted in September for three Russian ships to dock in the port of Ceuta between 28 October and 2 November. It said such stops for Russian naval vessels had taken place for years in Spanish ports. \\nNato had said the final decision on resupply rested with Spain. \\n\u201cWe are concerned and I have expressed that very clearly about the potential use of this battle group to increase Russia\u2019s ability and to be a platform for air strikes against Syria,\u201d Nato\u2019s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists on Tuesday.

Moscow announced last week a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d in attacks as part of a plan to allow civilians and fighters to leave the area.'"}, "time": 1742563435.9673347}
