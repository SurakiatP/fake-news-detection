Put simply, you should not be engaging with the world in any way comparable to Mr. Trump. This was true before he was elected, and it will be true long after he\u2019s gone.\u201d At press time, the reports\u2019 findings were being summarily dismissed out of hand by roughly 45 percent of the nation\u2019s population in a manner identical to that of Donald Trump.
