What is going on?\u201d \\nSteve Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 \\nGOP Nominee Donald Trump, who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him, shot out a tweet Thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines \u2018flipping\u2019 to register votes for Hillary Clinton, when voters choose Trump. \\n\u201cA lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas,\u201d Trump tweeted. \\n\u201cPeople are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?\u201d A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on? \\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016 \\nAs Infowars has highlighted , there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. A d v e r t i s e m e n t \\nWhile election officials have dismissed the reports, suggesting \u2018user error\u2019 is to blame, tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time. \\nLarry Norden, a voting technology expert, told NPR that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed. \\n\u201cOver time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate,\u201d Norden noted. \\nDuring elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines \u2018flipping\u2019. Indeed, the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as The Simpsons drew attention to it: \\nMeanwhile, The Washington Post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression, bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering Trump\u2019s \u2018rigged\u2019 election claims. \\nCallum Borchers, author at the Washington Post blog The Fix writes: Since the final presidential debate last week, many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to Donald Trump supporters: Your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election Nov. 8. A day later, the Times\u2019s Upshot blog increased Clinton\u2019s chances of winning to 93 percent , an all-time high. On Monday, Politico\u2019s Ben Schreckinger wrote that \u201c Donald Trump\u2019s path to an election night win is almost entirely closed .\u201d Here at The Fix, Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote that \u201c Donald Trump\u2019s chances of winning are approaching zero .\u201d These are accurate, statistically sound statements. But they are something else, too. Declarations that Trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the Republican nominee\u2019s warning that the \u201crigged\u201d election could be \u201c stolen from us .\u201d \\nThe latest polls, which Trump insists are rigged due to oversampling, show Clinton with a double digit lead. \\nHowever, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager Robby Mook has warned that Trump\u2019s suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are \u201cabsolutely right.\u201d \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day.\u201d Mook said, urging Clinton supporters to vote. \\n\u201cMake no mistake. With only 10 percent of votes cast, Donald Trump could win this election,\u201d Mook said.   9:15  '"}, "time": 1742563294.9858823}
