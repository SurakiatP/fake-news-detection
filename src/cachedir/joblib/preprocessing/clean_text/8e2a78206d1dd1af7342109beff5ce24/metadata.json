Bush was an exercise buff, obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at his ranch in Crawford, Tex. But Donald J. Trump is taking a different approach: A junk food aficionado, he is hoping to become the nation\u2019s fast food president. \u201cA \u2018fish delight,\u2019 sometimes, right?\u201d Mr. Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN    meeting in February, extolling the virtues of McDonald\u2019s. \u201cThe Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It\u2019s great stuff. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is improvised, undisciplined, rushed and  . And so is his diet. In an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients, Mr. Trump is a throwback to an earlier, more carefree time in American eating, when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown, and the first lady certainly didn\u2019t have a vegetable garden, complete with a bee hive, on the South Lawn of the White House. But in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts, Mr. Trump has broadcast his culinary preferences to the nation  \u2014   devouring a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken (while reading The Wall Street Journal) feasting on a McDonald\u2019s burger and fries (to celebrate clinching the Republican presidential nomination) and chowing down on a taco bowl (in an effort to woo Hispanic voters). He is a lover of diner fare and fast food grub, of overcooked steaks (\u201cIt would rock on the plate, it was so well done,\u201d his longtime butler once observed) and the bland nourishment of Americana. He prefers burgers and meatloaf, Caesar salads and spaghetti, See\u2019s Candies and Diet Coke. And he shuns tea, coffee and alcohol. But his highbrow, lowbrow image  \u2014   of the   mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the   seatbelt buckles  \u2014   is also a carefully crafted one. If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting \u201ca splash\u201d more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire, and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New England blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia, Mr. Trump\u2019s diet also telegraphs to his   base that he is one of them. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American and more    than fast food,\u201d said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist and ad maker. \u201cIt is the peculiarity of the brand that he\u2019s able to be on his   jet with the gold and black branding and colors, and at the same time eat KFC  \u2014   and what makes it perfect is he does it all with a knife and fork, while reading The Wall Street Journal. \u201d Or, as Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser and pollster on the Trump campaign, put it, \u201cIt goes with his authenticity. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think Hillary Clinton would be eating Popeye\u2019s biscuits and fried chicken,\u201d she said. Last April, Mrs. Clinton did, indeed, visit a Chipotle near Toledo, Ohio, stopping into the chain restaurant unrecognized, in black sunglasses, and ordering a chicken burrito bowl. And President Bill Clinton was perhaps the nation\u2019s first fast food commander in chief, famous for ending his jogs at McDonald\u2019s. (Mr. Clinton now adheres to a largely vegan diet.) Still, Mr. Trump seems to come by his appetite for fast food genuinely. While junk food has long been a staple of campaign trail life  \u2014   Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 press corps coined the term \u201cslunch\u201d to refer to the unhealthy phenomenon of the \u201csecond lunch\u201d  \u2014   Mr. Trump\u2019s reliance on   fare is driven more by a combination of speed, efficiency and, above all else, cleanliness. Though he often orders from the Trump Grill when working out of Trump Tower in Manhattan, he eats fast food several times a week while on the road because \u201cit\u2019s quick,\u201d as he told The Daily Mail last year while munching on Burger King on his Boeing  . Mr. Trump has even suggested doing away with state dinners, in a fit of cost and time savings. \u201cWe should be eating a hamburger on a conference table, and we should make better deals with China and others and forget the state dinners,\u201d he said. A man always prone to distraction and uninterested in small details, he has never approached food as anything other than a problem to be solved, quickly, as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, an occasional dining partner, once told The Washington Examiner. As the two men ate at   in Manhattan in 2002, Mr. Trump ordered briskly and imperiously from the head chef and owner, Mr. Christie recalled. \u201c  remember the appetizer you made for me last week when I was here?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the owner. \u201cWe\u2019ll take two of those. And remember that main course you made, the special thing you made for me? We\u2019ll take two of those, too. \u201d Mr. Christie watched with confusion and a bit of awe, he recalled in the interview. Mr. Trump looked at him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll love it. \u201d But Mr. Trump, who frets about germs and prizes cleanliness, also loves fast food because of its consistency and the promise, at least, of a basic level of hygiene. \u201cOne bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald\u2019s. One bad hamburger, you take Wendy\u2019s and all these other places and they\u2019re out of business,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Cooper of CNN. \u201cI\u2019m a very clean person. I like cleanliness, and I think you\u2019re better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s a certain standard. \u201d Still, he added, \u201cI think the food\u2019s good. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s dining habits also bespeak a certain lack of creativity, and parochialism  \u2014   the kid from Queens who made it across the river to Manhattan\u2019s glistening skyline, but never cottoned to the city\u2019s haute cuisine. He once praised the \u201cimagination\u201d of his wife, Melania, in the kitchen  \u2014   before citing, as examples of her culinary   spaghetti and meat sauce, salads and meatloaf. (He still keeps a copy of his mother\u2019s meatloaf recipe.) Along with McDonald\u2019s, his favorite fast food joint, a family member said, is Jackson Hole Burgers. He is also a stickler for manners, attacking his primary race rival, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, for scarfing down meals during impromptu news conferences. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion!\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd. And Mr. Trump, who sometimes sips his Diet Coke through a straw, once caused Manhattan foodies to weep into their quinoa when he took Sarah Palin to a Famous Famiglia pizza restaurant in Times Square  \u2014   and then proceeded to cut his oversize slice with a plastic knife and fork. He has other pretensions, as well. Howie Carr, a Boston Herald columnist, recalled traveling on Mr. Trump\u2019s plane and watching him rip the buns off his McDonald\u2019s patties before plying the burgers with ketchup. (\u201cDo you know how many calories you save that way?\u201d Mr. Trump asked Mr. Carr.) And Mr. Trump also told US Weekly that he tries to save calories on pizza. (\u201cI scrape the toppings off my pizza  \u2014   I never eat the dough,\u201d he said.) So pronounced are Mr. Trump\u2019s fast food preferences that Philip E. Beshara, a   lawyer, joked on Instagram that, as president, his cabinet would probably be staffed by Colonel Sanders, the Hamburglar and the Taco Bell Chihuahua. And, of course, the Republican nominee\u2019s dining whims also keep his team on its toes, with staff members worrying not just about the backdrop for his speeches  \u2014   but also where to find the nearest  . \u201cThere\u2019s never any real planning for food,\u201d said one, between events on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s always just whatever he is craving, which is more often than not McDonald\u2019s. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563727.8699465}
