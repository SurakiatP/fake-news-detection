Here\u2019s how we analyzed it in real time, and our live fact checks. The State of the Union is   \u2026     not happening this year, technically. But in a   address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, President Trump was expected to deliver the equivalent: a speech intended to set the course for his   policy agenda and mollify concerns on Capitol Hill after his uneven first month in office. \u25a0 The president tries to set the tone in an   interview on \u201cFox and Friends. \u201d He gives himself a grade of A so far. \u25a0 Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York, said he would break a nearly   streak and not try to greet the president, citing policy differences. Here is what to keep an eye on: President Trump suggested on Tuesday that the recent spate of   bomb threats and cemetery vandalism could be politically coordinated attacks to \u201cmake people look bad\u201d  \u2014   an apparent suggestion that his opponents could be behind them. Speaking at the White House to attorneys general from around the country, Mr. Trump was asked by Josh Shapiro, the attorney general of Pennsylvania, about the wave of attacks and how the federal government could work with state governments to confront the violence. \u201cFirst, he said the acts were reprehensible,\u201d Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat who was elected to the post in November, said while recounting Mr. Trump\u2019s response. \u201cSecond he said: \u2018And you\u2019ve got to be careful, it could be the reverse. This could be the reverse, trying to make people look bad.\u2019 \u201d The comments echoed the Twitter post of an adviser, Anthony Scaramucci, who suggested that Democrats were behind threats to Jewish community centers. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump was questioned for his seemingly reluctant denunciation of David Duke, the former Klansman who backed him, and for the onslaught of   hate from supporters on social media. At a news conference this month, Mr. Trump suggested that people who were holding up   signs at rallies were doing so to make him look bad. \u201cSome of it is written by our opponents,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cYou do know that. Do you understand that?\u201d Approximately 100 tombstones were toppled at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia this week, the second such attack in the city in the last month. Synagogues, community centers and cemeteries around the country have been targeted this year. Democrats condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks on Tuesday and called for an apology. \u201cFor millennia, Jews have not only endured unthinkable violence, but the subsequent denial of that violence,\u201d said Eric Walker, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. \u201cFor the president of the United States to insinuate that threats to Jewish community centers are illegitimate is truly beyond the pale. \u201d The   League, which combats   said it was \u201castonished\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s sentiments and called on him to clarify his remarks. Mr. Shapiro, speaking on the sidelines of the attorneys general conference, said that he was not entirely sure of what to make of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cI was a little surprised by it, and others were, too, Republicans and Democrats,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cThe question I asked was a genuine one and one of great concern to people in my state. \u201d Mr. Trump told the attorneys general that he planned to discuss the issue during his address to Congress on Tuesday night. Mr. Trump gave his presidency an A so far in an interview broadcast Tuesday morning, but he added that he would only give himself a C for communicating how great he has been. Appearing on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d which he has called one of his favorite shows, Mr. Trump blamed former President Barack Obama for organizing opposition against him, called Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, \u201cincompetent\u201d and gently criticized his own press secretary for how he has handled leaks. The interview, shown just hours before Mr. Trump was to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress, set the stage for a day when he will have perhaps the biggest audience available to him for the rest of his first year in office. He highlighted his plans to increase military spending, tighten borders and replace Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program, and he boasted that he had already brought back jobs to America. \u201cI think I\u2019ve done great things, but I don\u2019t think I have  \u2014   I and my people  \u2014   I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve explained it well enough to the American public,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I get an A in terms of what I\u2019ve actually done, but in terms of messaging, I\u2019d give myself a C or a  . \u201d He acknowledged that he did not have the support of a majority of Americans in polls, but he said those who do back him were more intense. \u201cThe love is great,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I saw a poll where I was at 45 or 46 percent, but one of the things they said is that the level of enthusiasm for me is as strong as they\u2019ve ever seen. \u201d Mr. Trump rejected criticism by Ms. Pelosi, who said that for all the sound and fury, the president had not actually accomplished much in his first month in office. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching Nancy\u2019s tape, and so I think she\u2019s incompetent, actually,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Asked by the Fox hosts if he thought Mr. Obama was responsible for some of the protests against his policies, Mr. Trump agreed but brushed it off. \u201cI think he is behind it,\u201d he said. \u201cI also think it\u2019s politics,\u201d adding, \u201cAnd look, I have a very thick skin. \u201d Mr. Trump, who has railed against leaks, said some of them had probably come from holdovers from the Obama administration. But he said his press secretary, Sean Spicer, was wrong to have brought a group of staff members into his office and inspect their cellphones in the presence of White House lawyers. \u201cSean Spicer is a fine human being he\u2019s a fine person,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI would have done it differently. I would have gone    with different people. \u201d He added: \u201cI would have handled it differently than Sean. But Sean handles it his way, and I\u2019m O. K. with it. \u201d For almost three decades, Representative Eliot L. Engel, a New York Democrat, has stood along the aisle of the House chamber for every presidential address to Congress, waiting to shake the president\u2019s hand. But on Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump will become the first president since 1989 to not receive a greeting from Mr. Engel. As curious reporters mused whether Mr. Engel would repeat his annual ritual of claiming his seat long before the address begins, the lawmaker bypassed the prime empty aisle seat and a chance to shake hands with his fellow New Yorker. Among other disagreements that factored into his decision to skip the handshake, Mr. Engel said, were Mr. Trump\u2019s unwillingness to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and his attacks on the news media. \u201cThe president needs to work with all people,\u201d Mr. Engel said. \u201cAnd therefore I will listen to what he has to say today, but I will not greet him and shake his hand. \u201d Mr. Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, has been among Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal critics in the House, pressing for further investigations into the administration\u2019s ties to Russia. In January Mr. Engel introduced legislation that would punish any foreign entity found to have intervened in a federal election. Some Democrats planned to make a statement with their wardrobe as well: A group of female members planned to wear white, the color of the suffragist movement, in a signal to Mr. Trump on women\u2019s rights. Representative Lois Frankel of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic Women\u2019s Working Group, said on Twitter that the choice of attire symbolized \u201ca pledge to protect women\u2019s health, fair pay, paid leave  more!\u201d Based on the preview that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, gave reporters on Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to hark back to his \u201claw and order\u201d theme by promising more aggressive federal policing of gun crimes, drugs and other areas in response to a rise in violent crime in some big cities. Crime is near historic lows nationwide and remains far below levels seen in the 1970s and \u201880s. But Mr. Sessions, a former senator and prosecutor who was an important campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, told reporters he was worried that the increase in violence in some major cities, like Chicago and Baltimore, was \u201cnot a blip\u201d and could signal \u201ca   trend. \u201d Mr. Sessions gave speech of his own on that topic Tuesday morning to the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington. Mr. Sessions said he wanted to let local police officers know \u201cthat they\u2019re being supported\u201d in Washington, and he suggested that morale was lagging in some departments because of a lack of federal leadership. Mr. Trump will also be trying to affirm his role as commander in chief. In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump described a raid in Yemen that left an American commando and a number of civilians dead as something that generals \u201cwanted to do\u201d and that was planned before he took office, drawing charges that he was deflecting responsibility for a mission he approved. Mr. Trump was asked to respond to William Owens, father of Chief Petty Officer William Owens, 36, the Navy SEAL member who was killed in the Jan. 29 raid. Mr. Owens told The Miami Herald that he refused to meet with the president when his son\u2019s body was returned home, and asked why the new administration had rushed into a \u201cstupid mission. \u201d \u201cWell, this was a mission that was started before I got here,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis was something that was, you know, just, they wanted to do. They came to see me, they explained what they wanted to do, the generals. \u201d Moments later, he reiterated that \u201cthis was something that they were looking at for a long time doing. \u201d His statement drew sharp responses from critics who said he was defying a long tradition of commanders shouldering responsibility for what happens under them. \u201cHe\u2019s the opposite of a `buck stops here\u2019 president,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cTrump has a predilection for always blaming somebody else for what goes wrong. \u201d Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger who served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration, wrote on Twitter that in the Trump worldview, \u201cTrump is responsible for all the victories, his team for all the defeats. \u201d Though he spoke of the Yemen mission not as his own, but as a project of \u201cthe generals,\u201d Mr. Trump boasted, \u201cMy generals are the most respected that we\u2019ve had in many decades, I believe. \u201d In fact, the military command consists almost entirely of people who were in their posts before he took office. Muslims. Immigrants. A recent detainee. Officially, the Democratic rebuttal to Mr. Trump\u2019s speech will come from Steven L. Beshear, the former governor of Kentucky, who will defend the Affordable Care Act. But inside the House chamber where Mr. Trump will speak, Democrats plan to assemble a cadre of human symbols, bringing as guests several people imperiled by the president\u2019s policies. Eschewing   boycotts of the speech  \u2014   a feature of Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural address  \u2014   members of Congress have used their invitations as another form of protest. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is bringing an Iraqi refugee who settled in the state in 2010 and is now an American citizen. Representative Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez of New York invited Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked as a translator for American forces in Iraq and was detained last month at Kennedy International Airport under the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban. Other guests include undocumented immigrants who were protected from deportation under Mr. Obama, an Iranian graduate student and the founder of the Syrian Community Network.'"}, "time": 1742562909.9580352}
