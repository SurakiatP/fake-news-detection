[Less than a year after Democrats were still complaining about \u201cRepublican obstructionism,\u201d the Democratic National Committee is now hyping events for what it is calling \u201cResistance Summer,\u201d featuring \u201chouse parties\u201d with DNC Deputy Chairman Keith Ellison.  \u201cThis summer, we\u2019re investing in all 50 states and connecting with every single voter in real life on the issues that matter to them  \u2014   from health care to education to jobs and economic opportunity,\u201d an email to supporters says. It is the first major event by the Democrats since the election of Tom Perez to the role of DNC Chair. Perez called the summer \u201cthe starting point\u201d for the Democrats plan to obstruct Trump\u2019s agenda. The \u201cResistance Summer\u201d will start on Saturday with \u201chouse parties\u201d across the country. The event will feature a \u201ckickoff livestream with Keith Ellison and some surprise guests!\u201d according to the email. Keith Ellison was Perez\u2019s main   rival for the nomination to DNC Chair, and was dogged by his ties to the Nation of Islam. \u201cThe best way for Democrats to turn the #Resistance into electoral wins is by doing one thing: organizing,\u201d Ellison said in a press release earlier this month. \u201cResistance Summer is the starting point and will take the Democratic Party\u2019s message of fairness and equality to activists on the front lines and all Americans looking to get engaged. \u201d The DNC won\u2019t just be hosting   house parties, but will also be pumping money, in the form of grants, into state party programs.   activist group MoveOn. org is planning a similar path with their own \u201cSummer of Resistance. \u201d A website for the event offers budding Bolsheviks the chance to become a \u201cResistance Summer MoveOn Mobilizer\u201d and to \u201cwin tangible victories this summer against Trumpism and for a hopeful future. \u201d \u201cMobilizers\u201d will be matched with 25 others, as well as \u201can expert Resistance Facilitator\u201d and receive $150 a month for cell phone minutes, transportation, and snacks. The DNC will be hoping that the \u201cResistance Summer\u201d will go smoother for them than the   \u201cunity tour\u201d featuring Perez and former presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ). That tour was plagued by division, booing, and a host of its own awkward moments. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.
