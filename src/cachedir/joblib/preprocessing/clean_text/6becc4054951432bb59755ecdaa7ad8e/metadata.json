[Delegates at the union\u2019s national conference in Cardiff on Monday voted for its members to teach about \u2018LGBT+\u2019 issues and lifestyles to toddlers starting from nursery school.  Teachers bemoaned a \u201clack of policies which promote LGBT+ within schools\u201d which they allege has a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on the   of students and teachers who are homosexual or transgender. It was revealed last month that primary schools will likely be legally obliged to teach pupils about   couples as part of the mandatory relationships curriculum that is due to begin from 2019. But the NUT says the amendment to the Children and Social Work Bill doesn\u2019t go far enough, calling for \u201c  content\u201d on the subject at an even younger age, and for secondary school pupils to be taught more about safe sex in gay relationships. NUT executive committee member Annette Pryce slammed a \u201cright wing, religious lobby\u201d which she blamed for having prevented ministers from proposing a more \u201cinclusive\u201d agenda for sex education. \u201cGenerations of young LGBT+ people who have been failed by the system are still not told explicitly in the law that their lives are important too,\u201d Pryce said. They urged ministers to make proposed sex and relationship education (SRE) \u201cinclusive\u201d to so that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students \u201care told explicitly in the law that their lives are important too\u201d. \u201cIt is high time that PSHE and SRE  \u2014   including LGBT+ education  \u2014   is recognised as an essential part of the school curriculum,\u201d NUT general secretary Kevin Courtney told the conference. \u201cIt is important for a modern   society to understand and embrace differences within our communities. \u201cThe alternative is many pupils being isolated, bullied or misinformed and, for many, there is an impact on health and   that can last well beyond school years,\u201d he warned. While teaching sex and relationships is not compulsory for nurseries, it is thought that NUT members working in daycare facilities for two to    could introduce it voluntarily. The Church of England announced that they support the introduction of statutory sex education in schools, and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has previously said that children should be taught to \u201crevere\u201d and \u201chonour\u201d LGBT people despite the Church\u2019s   teaching that homosexual acts are a sin. Chief executive at Christian Concern Andrea Williams, however, argued that teaching sex and relationships education (SRE) to    would be \u201cdevastating\u201d and risks \u201crobbing them of their innocence\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742563069.2271805}
