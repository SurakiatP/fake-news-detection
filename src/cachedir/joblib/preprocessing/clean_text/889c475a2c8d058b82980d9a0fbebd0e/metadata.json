Donald Trump met with Mexico\u2019s  president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, declaring him \u201ca friend\u201d and praising   as \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d in a showstopper of a trip to Mexico City. Mr. Trump said that he and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico discussed a border wall when they met, but not who would pay. But Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said on Twitter later that, \u201cI made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall. \u201d Many Mexicans expressed anger over the meeting. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign officials said his speech on immigration this evening in Phoenix would clarify his immigration policies. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton took a swipe at Mr. Trump, saying in a speech at the American Legion\u2019s national convention, \u201cIt certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again. \u201d She also countered his \u201cAmerican first\u201d approach, stressing the country\u2019s \u201cunique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress, a champion for freedom and opportunity. \u201d _____ 3. In other political news, Harry Reid, the    Senate minority leader, offered fellow Democrats a possible recourse if they win the White House and Senate this fall only to find the Republicans thwarting them. It\u2019s a drastic move: curtailing the filibuster, the minority party\u2019s   tool. \u201cWhat choice would Democrats have?\u201d he said. \u201cThe country can\u2019t be run this way, where nothing gets done. \u201d _____ 4. Geologists say these fossils, found in Greenland, are 3. 7 billion years old. If so, they are by far the oldest direct evidence of microbial activity ever found, challenging the time frame of evolution and theories of the origins of life. The finding \u201cwill be hotly debated,\u201d an Earth scientist at M. I. T. said. _____ 5. Brazil\u2019s Senate removed President Dilma Rousseff from office for manipulating the federal budget to try to hide the country\u2019s mounting economic problems. The move upended her leftist Workers\u2019 Party, one of South America\u2019s most powerful political organizations, but leaves Brazil under the rule of the equally tainted Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. _____ 6. A Times review of WikiLeaks\u2019 activities during the four years its founder, Julian Assange, has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London shows that the group\u2019s document releases have often benefited Russia, frequently at the expense of the West. In an interview, Mr. Assange called Russia a \u201cbit player on the world stage\u201d and said that scrutinizing superpowers like the United States was more relevant. _____ 7. Being famous for being famous, \u00e0 la the Kardashians, appears to be a thing of the past. Instagram, YouTube and gossip sites and podcasts, and now legacy media companies, are feeding on a new celebrity underclass, people who hover on the edges of fame. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to hate us, actually, because we are not doing something, we\u2019re not really doing anything,\u201d said the girl above, the de facto leader of the \u201cGucci Gang,\u201d four stylish      Parisians making their name on Instagram. _____ 8. A JetBlue plane from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. landed in Santa Clara, Cuba, the first scheduled U. S. service to the island nation in more than 50 years. It was the latest step toward normalizing relations between two former Cold War foes. \u201cTo the people who say these flights don\u2019t help: Yes, it does help,\u201d said a teary   passenger. \u201cIt opens Cuba to the world. \u201d _____ 9. A   teacher in Denver got more insight than she bargained for when she asked her students to finish the sentence, \u201cI wish my teacher knew. .. \u201d Some answers, recounted in a new book that has inspired many teachers to try the same approach: \u201cthat my mom might get diagnosed with cancer this week and I\u2019ve been without a home 3 different times this year alone\u201d \u201chow much I miss my dad because he got deported to Mexico\u201d \u201cthat my family and I live in a shelter. \u201d _____ 10. Beet and carrot juice pulp,   meat substitutes, grains, lentils, beans potato starch   \u2026     Chefs around the country are reaching for new combinations to create veggie burgers that can take a place of honor on even the most ambitious menus. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to use everything in our arsenal to make this mix that\u2019s superdelicious,\u201d said Brooks Headley of New York\u2019s acclaimed Superiority Burger. _____ 11. Finally, one of our   articles today is a lyrical meditation on domesticity by a novelist who carefully renovated her family\u2019s apartment and then, for a while, flinched over every scratch and spill. She takes a lesson from a friend\u2019s chaotic, boisterous household, in which rooms might be neglected but people aren\u2019t, and happiness is \u201cthe easiest of all things to find. \u201d _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
