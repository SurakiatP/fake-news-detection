Ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday\u2019s edition of Breitbart News Daily to discuss the prospective relocation of America\u2019s Israel embassy to Jerusalem. [Bolton said he was \u201cconcerned that the pace appears to have slowed down\u201d on the subject of moving America\u2019s embassy to Jerusalem.   LISTEN: \u201cI think one of the things that distinguished Donald Trump, and you can see it even in his first days in office, is during the campaign he said \u2018I\u2019m going to do X, Y, and Z\u2019  \u2014   and miraculous to behold, he\u2019s actually doing it on so many different fronts, internationally and domestically,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe kind of exception, at this point, appears to be moving the embassy. As I think we\u2019ve commented before, you can move the embassy by taking the plaque off the wall at our consulate building in Jerusalem and putting up a sign that says \u2018U. S. Embassy.\u2019 You can build a bigger embassy, the   embassy, obviously over a longer period of time, but you could make the dramatic move quickly,\u201d Bolton argued. \u201cI very much fear that what\u2019s happening is that foreign countries, the State Department, maybe some inside the administration are saying, \u2018Oh, but it\u2019s going to cause difficulties. People are threatening to riot. It\u2019ll hurt the interests of Israel and the United States,\u2019 and this and that and the other thing, which is what they say every time this issue comes up,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut once you slow down, once you miss the chance to strike dramatically in the early days  \u2014   and there\u2019s a diplomatic phrase for that, of course, in French we say \u2018making it a fait accompli,\u2019 an accomplished fact  \u2014   once you give up that opportunity, the cost actually mounts. And so we\u2019ll see what happens. We\u2019ll know more, I think, when Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel comes in the next few weeks, and see what he and the President discuss,\u201d Bolton anticipated. He allowed that moving the embassy \u201cwould certainly necessitate a lot of active diplomacy to calm down people who might be concerned about it,\u201d but said reneging on Trump\u2019s stated commitment to the move would be tantamount to \u201callowing other people, in other countries, to tell us who we talk to, where we put our embassy. \u201d For that reason, Bolton thought Trump did a \u201cfantastic thing when he took a congratulatory phone call from Tsai   the president of Taiwan\u201d  \u2014   an unprecedented move that caused \u201ca lot of heart murmurings in some quarters, and upset Beijing, heaven forbid. \u201d \u201cHere is a case where the United States, for years, has let Beijing tell us who we could talk to in Taiwan. Just think about that for a minute. And now we have other governments telling us where we can put our embassy in Israel. Can they tell us where to put our embassy in Canada?\u201d he asked sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about relations with Canada or Israel. I\u2019m talking about Germany saying, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t put your embassy in Canada there. \u2019\u201d  \u201cObviously the Middle East is a sensitive area,\u201d he conceded. \u201cYou want to be prudent, you want to be careful. But you ought to do what the United States needs to have done. The qualms that others may have are things you need to alleviate, you need to deal with, you need to be reasonable about it, but they\u2019re not qualms that stop you from acting in your own interest. \u201d Bolton said it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d a good thing that Israel has been \u201cemboldened\u201d to build more settlements by Trump\u2019s election. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge legal battle over what the status of the   occupied territories is, going back to the League of Nations mandate, and the assumption of the mandate by the United Nations in 1945, and the termination of the mandate in Israel\u2019s declaration of independence in 1948,\u201d he recalled.  \u201cI mean, we could spend hours going through this. Here\u2019s the reality: the U. N. in 1967 basically said, after the   War, Israel can trade land for peace. Up until the resolution Obama allowed to go through, two days before Christmas, that was the basis for peace in the Middle East. That was the basis for Israel\u2019s peace treaty with Egypt, for its treaty with Jordan. It could have been the basis of peace with others. \u201d  \u201cIsrael has the land. Let\u2019s forget the legalities. Israel has control of the territory. They believe it\u2019s their land, dating back historically, and they\u2019re building settlements on it. I tell you what, nobody\u2019s going to stop them,\u201d Bolton declared.  \u201cYou can either deal with that reality and look for what a solution for the Palestinians would be  \u2014   I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the   solution, I think it\u2019s giving parts of the West Bank to Jordan, putting it under their sovereignty, Israel keeping the rest. Or you can just enjoy the rhetoric about how settlements are an obstacle to peace, and it\u2019s really terrible, and so on and so forth. It\u2019s the same sort of threatening rhetoric that accompanies talk about whether the U. S. will move its embassy to Jerusalem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think the real answer, I think the Israelis know what they\u2019re doing. I think they\u2019re going to create their own facts on the ground, which is what the United States ought to do with the embassy,\u201d he suggested. Marlow turned to President Trump\u2019s executive orders restricting immigration from several   countries, orders which are certain to stir up controversy. Bolton noted those countries were also places where \u201cwe can have little or no faith in the sustained ability of the   governments of these countries to be able to tell us honestly the backgrounds of a lot of people who are applying for visas. \u201d \u201cThere is no effective government in Yemen now, for example, just to name one. Or Syria, while we\u2019re on the subject,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary ban. I think Trump during the campaign, although he made sweeping statements earlier, came back by the end of the campaign to a program very similar to what Ted Cruz articulated, very similar to what the George W. Bush administration put in place after  : that you\u2019re concerned more about applicants for visas from countries that are sources of terrorism than you\u2019re concerned about applicants for visas from countries that are not sources of terrorism. \u201d  \u201cI would be more concerned across the board about somebody from Syria applying for a visa than I am about somebody from Iceland applying for a visa,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not hard to figure out. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with religion. It has to do with terrorism. \u201d \u201cSo getting the system under control  \u2014   and I think law enforcement and intelligence officials, even in the Obama administration, testified that we didn\u2019t have adequate vetting for visa applicants  \u2014   is sensible. It\u2019s what Trump said he was going to do. Nobody should be surprised at this,\u201d Bolton concluded. Commenting on the recent court setback for Brexit, Bolton said he didn\u2019t think the ruling was \u201cquite as bad as it could have been,\u201d and doubted it would be a serious impediment to British Prime Minister Theresa May \u201cnegotiating Brexit on her terms. \u201d \u201cSome of the things they didn\u2019t do in the court ruling are important,\u201d he noted. \u201cNumber One, there\u2019s no reference in this issue to the European High Court, the highest judicial body of the European Union, which could have been fatal. Given the way   have been subordinated to the European Union, that was not entirely out of the question. So that\u2019s one big win there. \u201d \u201cSecond, none of the   devolved parliaments  \u2014   whether in Ireland, Wales, or Scotland  \u2014   are going to have any say in it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe court ruled this is a national matter for the United Kingdom as a whole, and that\u2019s great. So Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish National Party can go pound sand on this one. It\u2019s going to be decided in Westminster by the House of Commons and the House of Lords. \u201d \u201cIn fact, they said it\u2019s not a question of the Prime Minister\u2019s authority to take Britain out of the European Union treaty, it\u2019s an issue dealing with statutory law in Great Britain, because so much European law over these past 30 years has been imposed on Great Britain that it would take an act of Parliament to begin the exit process,\u201d Bolton observed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s really going to be an obstacle. I think they in fact are talking about introducing a bill this week. It can be a very short bill. \u201d \u201cThe Labor party and the Liberal Democrats can moan and groan about it all they want, but Theresa May has a solid majority, and I think they\u2019ll push it through,\u201d he predicted. \u201cIn fact, I think Labor, the Liberal Democrats in particular, will just do themselves more damage by saying, \u2018You know, by God, just because the people voted to leave the European Union doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re as smart as we are! We\u2019re going to substitute our judgment for theirs and try and prevent it from happening.\u2019 You know, knock yourself out if that\u2019s what you want to do. I just think it\u2019s politically foolish on their part. \u201d \u201cBut I would have preferred a cleaner victory,\u201d he added. \u201cI think this decision to withdraw is prospective only. I don\u2019t see why you need a parliamentary vote. But given the majority the conservatives have, I don\u2019t even think they can slow it down that much. \u201d John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and presides over his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.
