Like most people who come here, I set off thinking I was going to live in paradise. That\u2019s far from the reality, let me tell you!\\nLiving in South East Asia has its pros and cons, just like anywhere else. While I myself have decided to return west for a while, I\u2019ll always have a connection to Asia and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be back many times throughout my life.\\nSo what\u2019s the REAL story with living in Asia? Is it all its cracked up to be? What does a man have to be aware of when coming here? Let\u2019s look at six common stereotypical ideas about living in South East Asia, and assess them in the light of reality.\\n1. Asian Women Are Kind, Gentle, And Compliant To Their Husbands So sweet! Not so fast\u2026.\\nThis is, most definitely, a myth, and if you come out here expecting to find some little house pet who does your bidding, you\u2019ll be in for a rude awakening.\\nIt\u2019s definitely true that Asian women, in my experience, are a lot more traditional. They give the man his place in the house, rarely question your final decisions, and do not resent housework and basic wifely duties.\\nHowever, the idea that they\u2019ll just do whatever you tell them without question is nonsense. They\u2019re human beings with a will of their own and you wouldn\u2019t be the first guy to get a smack in the head from a five-foot-two broad who weighs 90 pounds if you disrespect her.\\nThe idea that Asian women are some sort of angelic alternative to Western women is also nonsense. While it\u2019s not the norm, I\u2019ve met several Western men who have been taken to the cleaners by their Asian wives and girlfriends. When you move here, you\u2019re completely at her mercy and you will never have any legal rights as a citizen.\\nAsian women generally are a lot more traditional, but this stereotype that they\u2019re some sort of perfect wife material has got to go. They\u2019re individuals\u2014and there are all kinds, good and bad, among them.\\nRead this guide to dating Asian women for a more complete perspective on the issue. It\u2019s a thorny subject, and there\u2019s a lot of misunderstanding surrounding it.\\n2. Asia Is Ridiculously Cheap \\nThis is one I\u2019d have to lean slightly towards agreeing with.\\nMost things in Asia are a lot cheaper. Eating out for my entire family often costs less than $15, meaning I can afford to do it basically every day. My rent for a condo apartment costs less than $150 a month, although that\u2019s mostly because I live in the sticks and am not in a major city.\\nA general rule of thumb is that outside of major cities like Bangkok, Singapore, and KL, you can divide the cost of living by three and get a rough estimate.\\nNote, this does not apply to consumer goods such as cars and electrical appliances, which are in and around the same price. It certainly does not apply to luxury goods, which are often much more expensive because of the taxes placed on them by local governments.\\nAsia is cheaper overall, but anything other than the basics costs roughly the same. Life in South East Asia CAN be cheaper, but it isn\u2019t necessarily so\u2014it depends on your lifestyle.\\n3. You Can Become A Citizen Of An Asian Country And Stay Forever Becoming a citizen in an Asian country is nigh on impossible. Even if you could, you probably wouldn\u2019t want to.\\nYou can get a variety of visas like permanent residency, and each country aims to facilitate the spouses of their nationals and, especially, retirees with proven cash in the bank. However, you\u2019ll not become a CITIZEN with all of the various rights they enjoy.\\nIt\u2019s also worth noting: while you might get permanent residence, you\u2019ll never be \u201cone of them.\u201d Even if you live here for 30 years, you will always be a foreigner and will be viewed as such by locals. This has pros and cons to it, but you\u2019ll never quite feel at home and accepted as one of the group.\\nYou\u2019ll get undue respect from some for being a Westerner, but forget about talking politics or leveling criticisms at the way things are done\u2014you\u2019ll be met with hostility and resentment for the latter.\\n4. The Weather In Asia Is 24/7 Sunshine \\nThe weather in South East Asia is generally pretty awesome, and you can live an outdoors life you\u2019ll truly enjoy if you\u2019re that type.\\nThe sun shines almost every day, and even when it\u2019s overcast it\u2019s warm, meaning you can go out and about and do anything from walk on the beach to shop in the city.\\nHowever, when the storms come, you\u2019d better be prepared to get your ass inside. The rainfall and wind in many countries in South East Asia is truly terrifying. Just switch on any news station the next time a major storm hits the Philippines and you\u2019ll see what it\u2019s like.\\nThankfully, after 1.5 years of living in the Philippines , I\u2019ve never been caught directly in a major storm, although I\u2019ve seen the tail end of plenty of them.\\nThe weather is good when it\u2019s good, and utterly awful when it\u2019s bad. Check this clip out to see how bad it can get:\\n\\n5. Asia Is 100 Years Behind The West In Terms Of Development \\nThis is a stereotype that\u2019s deeply mistaken, and whether or not it\u2019s true depends on which country you go to.\\nTrue, countries like Laos and Bangladesh are miles behind any Western nation, but head to Singapore and you\u2019ll be shocked by how far ahead of us they are in terms of tech and development.\\nAsia is developing at breakneck pace, and with that development comes super highways, skytrains, skyscrapers and everything else we usually associate with an advanced country. It won\u2019t be long before many countries out here catch up and surpass the West, although it is definitely true that most of them are slightly behind for now.\\nThere\u2019s a phenomenon called \u201cleapfrogging\u201d which virtually guarantees Asian countries will catch up to and surpass the West quickly. Leapfrogging is when they can skip all of the evolution and development and simply emulate modern day technology developed elsewhere\u2014a great example is India, where they have skipped the transition from dial-up to mobie internet and gone straight from nothing to mobile.\\nIf you think this can\u2019t be done and there are intellectual property laws to protect tech from being stolen wholesale, I salute you, but I have to laugh. There are no such laws, and even if there were, nobody would bother to enforce them.\\nOn the other hand, you still have many scenes like this outside your window when you get out of the main cities:\\n\\n6. Asians Are Extremely Family Oriented Again, this is one I lean towards agreeing with. There are exceptions to every rule, but the family unit is extremely strong in Asia, especially countries like the Philippines.\\nI don\u2019t want to wax lyrical or speculate as to why this is. It\u2019s enough to acknowledge it as a fact and accept that it\u2019s the case. 90% of the Asian people I have ever met and gotten to know from Indonesia to the Philippines to Thailand are devoted to their families to the extent that we\u2019d consider it cult-like in most Western countries.\\nI pass no judgment on this whatsoever. It can be a great thing or a bad thing, depending on your own perspective. I personally like it and think it\u2019s something we\u2019ve lost in many European countries, and America, too.\\nThis is an idea about Asia I agree with\u2014the dedication to family above individuality is definitely true, and so by default if you get into a relationship with an Asian woman, be prepared for this.\\nThe family unit is the sun around which everything orbits in most Asian countries.\\nLiving In Asia Summary Sorry to disappoint you, fellas, but you won\u2019t find paradise in South East Asia.\\nWhat you will find is a place with many opportunities, pitfalls, pros and cons, but which I do not regret living in for a single second and which has come to be a large part of my life\u2019s story.\\nI came out for a year and stayed for almost a decade. However, I\u2019ve decided that time is now over and it\u2019s time to go home.\\nI\u2019d love to hear about your experiences living or traveling in Asia. Do you find my perceptions to be accurate, or do you have a different view?\\nRead More: Why Western Men Prefer Foreign Women Over Their Own \\n\\n'"}, "time": 1742562242.9481683}
