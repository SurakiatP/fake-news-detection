Trump\u2019s incoming administration, its CEO Mark Fields announced on Tuesday. [The announcement means Ford will cancel its plans to build a new plant in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan \u2014  creating 700 new jobs here in the United States \u2014  CNN reports.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t cut a deal with Trump. We did it for our business,\u201d Fields told CNN, noting that his company had conversations on Tuesday with Trump and Vice   Mike Pence. Trump and Pence will officially be sworn in on Jan. 20. Fields said his company\u2019s decision to create jobs in America rather than in Mexico is a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d in Trump\u2019s incoming administration and the   environment it will create. The investment, CNN reports, will be at the plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, and will aim \u201cto produce more electric and   cars\u201d since \u201cFord believes electric vehicles will outsell   vehicles within the next 15 years. \u201d Trump\u2019s success in keeping Ford jobs here is winning praise even from labor unions. \u201cI am thrilled that we have been able to secure additional   jobs for American workers,\u201d Jimmy Settles, the UAW\u2019s vice president, said. CNN notes that Ford\u2019s decision to keep the jobs here in the U. S. rather than shipping them overseas to Mexico \u2014  as it announced early in 2016 \u2014  is a \u201cmajor  \u201d for the auto manufacturer. \u201cThe news is a major   for Ford,\u201d CNN wrote. \u201cLast year, the company announced it would invest $1. 6 billion in Mexico to transfer the production of the Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico to save costs. Now the Focus will be built at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, and Ford will expand its plant in Flat Rock. \u201d Breitbart News was the first news organization to ask Trump about Ford\u2019s plans to ship jobs to Mexico. In an interview back in February 2016, Breitbart News asked Trump about this decision from Ford \u2014  and about similar plans from Carrier Corporation, which had planned to expand in Mexico and shut down U. S. facilities in Indianapolis \u2014  and Trump laid out his exact plans to keep the jobs here in the United States instead of seeing them drained to Mexico. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way you\u2019re going to reverse it, and that\u2019s that you\u2019re going to have to make it more expensive to do business that way,\u201d Trump told Breitbart News back then about the news from Ford and Carrier that they planned to go overseas: First of all, you\u2019re going to have to look to lower taxes [for those who do business inside the United States] \u2014  and we may very well have to charge taxes at the border, when somebody drives a car through the border to sell it in the United States. But look, we\u2019ve closed our plants. We\u2019ve lost our jobs. They\u2019re no going to build cars in Mexico and sell them in the United States, okay? We can lower our taxes, and we\u2019re probably going to have to charge a surtax at the border. Otherwise we\u2019re going to lose a fortune. And that will help Ford and other people make a decision to buy in the United States, to build in the United States. Even though he\u2019s not even president yet, Trump has already succeeded on both cases, Carrier and Ford. He\u2019s also succeeded in getting 8, 000 other jobs in the U. S. with Sprint and OneWeb, news announced last week. Trump, of course, shocked the political class by winning the state of Michigan against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton on Nov. 8 on his pathway to 306 electoral votes.'"}, "time": 1742561860.866706}
