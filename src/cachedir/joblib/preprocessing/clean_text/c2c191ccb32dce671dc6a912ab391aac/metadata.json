The rule, released by the Interior Department in March of last year and scheduled to take effect this Friday, was designed to increase the safety of fracking. It would have required companies to comply with federal safety standards in the construction of fracking wells, and to disclose the use of some chemicals in the fracking process. Judge Scott W. Skavdahl of Federal District Court in Wyoming ruled that the Interior Department lacked the authority from Congress to issue the regulation, and also noted that fracking was already subject to other regulations under state and federal law. The decision comes amid a heated political debate over fracking, which involves the injection of water, gravel and chemicals underground to extract oil and gas. The technology has produced an oil and gas boom in the United States, but environmentalists say fracking can contaminate groundwater and lead to the leaking of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The blocked rule would not have affected most fracking operations in the United States, since it would have applied only to fracking on federal lands. The vast majority of fracking in the United States  \u2014   almost 90 percent  \u2014   is done on state and private land and is governed by state and local regulations. The rule was unlikely to have stopped most new fracking on public lands, although oil and gas companies complained that it could have slowed operations by creating burdensome paperwork. And Judge Skavdahl\u2019s ruling is not the final word. While the regulation will be temporarily halted, the federal Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is also reviewing the rule. Obama administration officials characterized Judge Skavdahl\u2019s ruling as a delay, and said they were waiting for the decision by the appeals court. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that implementation of the rule continues to be delayed, because it prevents regulators from using 21st century standards to ensure that oil and gas operations are conducted safely and responsibly on public and tribal lands,\u201d the Interior Department said in a statement from the agency\u2019s spokeswoman, Jessica Kershaw. Nonetheless, the oil and gas industry and Republicans who have opposed Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental regulations claimed a victory. \u201cToday\u2019s decision demonstrates B. L. M. \u2019s efforts are not needed and that states are  \u2014   and have for over 60 years been  \u2014   in the best position to safely regulate hydraulic fracturing,\u201d said Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which had sued the administration over the rule. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said in a statement: \u201cHydraulic fracturing is one of the keys that has unlocked our nation\u2019s energy resurgence in oil and natural gas, making the United States the largest energy producer in the world, creating tens of thousands of   jobs, and lowering energy prices for consumers. Yet the Obama administration has sought to regulate it out of existence. This is not only harmful for the economy and consumers, it\u2019s unlawful  \u2014   as the court has just ruled. \u201d Mr. Ryan added: \u201cOnly Congress can write laws. Agencies acting without authority from Congress is simply illegal. \u201d Environmentalists say they held out hope that the rule would be upheld by an appeals court. \u201cOur hope remains that the full 10th Circuit will continue its review of the case and uphold this rule,\u201d said Lena Moffitt, the director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign. \u201cWhile there is no way to ever make fracking safe, the oil and gas industry has repeatedly proven that it needs more standards to keep the public safe from the dangers of fossil fuels, not less,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742563461.2347467}
