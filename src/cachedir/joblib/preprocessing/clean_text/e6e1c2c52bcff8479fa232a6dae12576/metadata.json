Three decades later, the Partnership for   Kids (the group formerly known as the Partnership for a   America) is bringing the frying pan out of retirement and firing up the stove again. But this time questions are the point. The group hopes it can tap into the nostalgia parents may have for the old frying egg ad while also letting them know their children do indeed want answers about drugs. \u201c\u2018Any questions\u2019 was the end. Now it\u2019s the beginning,\u201d said Scott Seymour, chief creative officer at BFG Communications, which created print and digital banner ads for the new campaign. \u201cThe landscape of drugs has really gotten a lot more complex, so we took this idea of having a succession of questions delivered by kids,\u201d he said. The group drew on real inquiries from parents to develop the questions featured in the ads, which cover topics like prescription drugs and marijuana legalization. Children today feel empowered and entitled to ask questions about drugs, and parents are more willing to entertain those questions, observers say. \u201cBecause of parenting styles today, parents are engaged with their kids in a different way,\u201d said Kristi Rowe, chief marketing officer at the Partnership for   Kids. \u201cThey\u2019re really stumped by the questions. They don\u2019t know how to answer them. \u201d The new ads open with an egg frying in a pan, as in the original, but then build on that by showing children asking their questions. Parents are then pointed to the partnership\u2019s website, which offers suggestions for how to answer questions like if and when prescription drugs are O. K. how marijuana can be \u201cbad\u201d if it\u2019s also legal, and whether or not parents tried drugs when they were younger. (The partnership calls that one the toughest to address.) \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in parents wanting to answer those questions thoughtfully,\u201d said Jo Shoesmith, chief creative officer at Campbell Ewald, the agency that worked on the new TV spot. \u201cHence the execution where we start off asking those questions. \u201d The campaign includes print and digital advertising, as well as a television spot that begins this week, with a   by the actress Allison Janney (\u201cThe West Wing,\u201d \u201cMom\u201d). Ms. Rowe said all of the creative work, print space and airtime were donated. \u201cIt would have cost us well over $1 million, just from the production values alone,\u201d she said. Getting networks to donate commercial time to air a public service announcement is a huge advantage for groups like the partnership, but the drawback is that networks have more latitude about when they choose to show the ads than they would with a paying customer. Working with an already familiar motif like the fried egg takes some of the pressure off the partnership because the ad does not have to waste time introducing the organization and its goals to the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most famous P. S. A. campaigns of all time,\u201d said Adam Duhachek, a professor of marketing at Indiana University, adding that nostalgia can be a very effective tool for marketers. \u201cWe see lots of examples of it being done, so I think it\u2019s one of the tropes advertisers continually rely on,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re hoping that the success they had 30 years ago and this powerful visual metaphor will still resonate. \u201d Since this new campaign is aimed at parents rather than their children, the famous tag line has been tweaked a bit, from \u201cyour brain on drugs\u201d to \u201ca brain on drugs,\u201d and the ads refer parents to the partnership\u2019s website, a digital resource that didn\u2019t exist at the time of the initial campaign. Despite these differences, the egg is what sticks. \u201cGiven that it was the 30th anniversary, we thought it was a perfect time to build off the imagery and equity of the fried egg spot,\u201d Ms. Shoesmith said. \u201cIt was a perfect opportunity to reflect the new strategy and changing parenting styles. \u201d Allen Rosenshine, executive creative director for the partnership and chairman emeritus of ad agency BBDO Worldwide, echoed that thought. \u201cThe entire drug scene has changed so much that strategies we might have employed even 10 years ago aren\u2019t relatable today,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go back to the original   spot, it was a rather    statement that drugs are dangerous. \u201d Bringing back the egg in the frying pan gives parents a familiar frame of reference even as it conveys to parents that today\u2019s conversations about drugs need to be more nuanced, Ms. Shoesmith said. \u201cWe acknowledge where we were, and it\u2019s this evolution to reflect the conversation parents are having with their kids now,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742562194.2853363}
