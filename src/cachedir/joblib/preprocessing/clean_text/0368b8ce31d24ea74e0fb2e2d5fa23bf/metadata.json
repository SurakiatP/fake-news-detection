Rand Paul ( ) called on former National Security Advisor Susan Rice to be brought in front of Congress under subpoena and asked questions about allegations she was behind the unmasking of American identities in raw surveillance.  Paul also said she should be asked about former President Barack Obama\u2019s knowledge of these alleged activities. \u201cFor years, both progressives and libertarians have been complaining about these backdoor searches,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re searching maybe one foreign leader and who they talk to we search everything in the whole world. There were reports a couple of years ago that all of Italy\u2019s phone calls were absorbed in a one month period of time. We were getting Merkel\u2019s phone calls we were getting everybody\u2019s phone calls. But by rebound we are collecting millions of Americans phone calls. If you want to look at an American\u2019s phone call or listen to it, you should have to have a warrant, the old fashioned way in a real court where both sides get represented. \u201d \u201cBut a secret warrant by a secret court with a lower standard level because we\u2019re afraid of terrorism is one thing for foreigners but both myself and a Progressive Ron Wyden have been warning about these back door searches for years and that they could be politicized,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe facts will come out with Susan Rice. But I think she ought to be under subpoena. She should be asked did you talk to the president about it? Did President Obama know about this? So this is actually, eerily similar to what Trump accused them of which is eavesdropping on conversations for political reasons. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561890.3003776}
