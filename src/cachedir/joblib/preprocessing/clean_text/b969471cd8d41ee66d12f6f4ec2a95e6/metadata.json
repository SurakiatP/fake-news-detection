[Mr Hill, who was unveiled last week as the new independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the Sunday Telegraph that there was an \u201cenormous ongoing risk which none of us can ignore\u201d.  One of Britain\u2019s leading prosecutors, he said the risk of terror in Britain is at its highest since the 1970s. He cautioned that \u201cit would be wrong to draw a simple comparison between Irish republicanism and the ideology of   Islamic State. \u201cBut in terms of the threat that\u2019s represented, I think the intensity and the potential frequency of serious plot planning  \u2014   with a view to indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians of whatever race or colour in metropolitan areas  \u2014   represents an enormous   risk that none of us can ignore. \u201d Mr Hill, whose appointment follows a 30 year legal career, also expressed concern over the imminent return to Britain of hundreds of jihadis who have been fighting with Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous concern that large numbers  \u2014   we know this means at least hundreds of British citizens who have left this country in order to fight  \u2014   are now returning or may be about to return,\u201d Mr Hill said. \u201cOf course the imminent fall of Mosul and perhaps the prospective retaking of Raqqa are both bound to lead to a higher instance of returning fighters. Does that mean that the British public need to be immediately alarmed at a spike in terrorist activity within this country? \u201cThe answer to that is, I don\u2019t know, but it doesn\u2019t follow as a matter of fact that those who chose to go to live or fight abroad will bring that fight back to this country. \u201d Mr Hill further cautioned that British teenagers are being \u201cradicalised by hate speech online\u201d. But he defended ministers who approved the reported \u00a31 million payout to Ronald Fiddler  \u2014   the former Guantanamo detainee who this month carried out a suicide bomb attack. Figures disclosed by the Home Office in May last year showed that just one in eight jihadis who fought in the Middle East for extremist groups had been successfully prosecuted. Earlier this week a National Front member was sentenced to five years jail after making a series of offensive posts online, and distributing racist stickers and posters near his house. \u201cWe are as committed to apprehending and prosecuting far right extremists who commit terrorist offences and promote hatred as we are those who support and promote Islamic State. Both are intent on destroying communities and pose a real risk if they are allowed to continue\u201d said Dean Haydon of the Counter Terrorism Command following the verdict.'"}, "time": 1742628553.0300515}
