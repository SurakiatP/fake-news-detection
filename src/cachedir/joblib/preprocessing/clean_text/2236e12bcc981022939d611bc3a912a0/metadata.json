[\u201cMay the Super Bowl this year be a sign of peace, friendship and solidarity to the world,\u201d Francis said in his native Spanish, in a video message released on Super Bowl Sunday.  Sunday\u2019s contest between New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons, held in Houston, Texas, at 6:30pm Eastern Time, is one of the most watched television event of the year, popular not only in the United States but around the world. \u201cMajor sporting events like the Super Bowl are highly symbolic and show that it is possible to build a culture of encounter and a world of peace,\u201d the Pope said in his message. \u201cTaking part in sports activities makes us go beyond   and in a healthy way to learn the meaning of sacrifice and grow in respect and respect for the rules. \u201d This is the first time a pontiff has ever blessed the football   signaling his esteem for athletics and their importance for forming key human virtues.
