Chris Christie of New Jersey was told about the George Washington Bridge lane closings  \u2014   and that they were done to punish a mayor who had declined to endorse him for    \u2014   during a Sept. 11 memorial service two days after they began, a former ally who orchestrated the scheme testified in federal court here on Tuesday. Mr. Christie, the witness recalled, laughed at the news. The closings of the access lanes in September 2013 continued for two more days, creating a catastrophic traffic jam that created gridlock for emergency vehicles, school buses and commuters in Fort Lee, N. J. But Mr. Christie made no effort to reopen the lanes and end the gridlock. Instead, his former ally said, the governor was clearly delighted and seemed to savor the scheme. And after learning that the Fort Lee mayor\u2019s persistent and urgent calls for help were being ignored, Mr. Christie said in a sarcastic tone, \u201cI imagine he wouldn\u2019t get his calls returned. \u201d The former ally, David Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to being the culprit behind the lane closings, testified as prosecutors showed a series of photographs of him, Mr. Christie and Bill Baroni, then the governor\u2019s top staff appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the bridge, at a service in Lower Manhattan on the 12th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The photos showed the three men in a loose huddle outside the governor\u2019s official vehicle on a dirt roadway between the Sept. 11 memorial and the World Trade Center construction site. Mr. Christie, who has previously said he did not recall the conversation, appears engaged and animated, looking directly into Mr. Baroni\u2019s eyes, raising his eyebrows and laughing in some of the frames and reaching out to touch the other men\u2019s arms. \u201cWe were all very relaxed,\u201d Mr. Wildstein testified. \u201cWere you and Mr. Baroni bragging?\u201d asked Lee Cortes, an assistant United States attorney. \u201cVery much so,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said. \u201cThis was our one constituent. I was pleasing my one constituent. I was rather happy that he was happy. \u201d Mr. Wildstein\u2019s testimony narrating the set of photographs was the first detailed accounting of how the governor learned about the closings  \u2014   which would ultimately become a scandal damaging his presidential ambitions. Mr. Christie is not charged in the case. Prosecutors have declined to explain their decisions on whom to charge, but the United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, has said that simply knowing is not a federal crime. He noted that when Ms. Kelly and Mr. Baroni were charged that there were unindicted   but said his office had brought only charges it believed it could prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr. Baroni began, Mr. Wildstein testified on Tuesday, by telling Mr. Christie in a sardonic tone that there was a \u201ctremendous amount of traffic\u201d in Fort Lee and told Mr. Christie, a Republican, he would be \u201cvery pleased to know\u201d that the mayor, a Democrat, was \u201cvery frustrated,\u201d Mr. Wildstein testified. Mr. Christie joked about Mr. Wildstein\u2019s role, he testified, using the name Mr. Wildstein had used in his past life as an anonymous political blogger, Wally Edge. \u201cMr. Baroni said to Governor Christie that I was monitoring the traffic, I was watching over everything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cGovernor Christie said in the sarcastic tone of the conversation, \u2018Well, I\u2019m sure Mr. Edge would not be involved in anything that\u2019s political. \u2019\u201d Mr. Wildstein testified that Mr. Christie had not known about the lane closings before they happened. But the governor did know that the mayor, Mark Sokolich, had fallen out of favor with the Christie team for refusing to endorse him despite nearly three years of wooing with gifts and favors from the administration. And Mr. Christie did not signal disapproval. \u201cFrom this conversation, were you concerned about continuing the lane reduction?\u201d the prosecutor, Mr. Cortes asked. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said. Beginning with a marathon news conference in January 2014 after the lane closing scheme had become  public, Mr. Christie has insisted that he had nothing to do with planning or executing the shutdown of two of the three access lanes from Fort Lee to the bridge, the world\u2019s busiest. At an event in Trenton on Tuesday, he denied Mr. Wildstein\u2019s allegations that he knew about the closings as they were happening. \u201cAll kinds of stuff is going on up in a courtroom in Newark,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cI want to be really clear: I have not and will not say anything different than I\u2019ve been saying since January 2014. No matter what is said up there, I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments. \u201d But here, where Mr. Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, are on trial in United States District Court on charges including  fraud and conspiracy, prosecutors and defense lawyers alike have said Mr. Christie understood what was going on while the lanes were closed. Mr. Wildstein testified that he and Mr. Baroni had looked forward to telling the governor, seeing it as \u201ca curtain call. \u201d Ms. Kelly, he said, had told him, \u201cThe governor is going to love this. \u201d \u201cI remember the quote,\u201d Mr. Wildstein added. \u201c\u2018The governor is going to love this. \u2019\u201d Mr. Wildstein also named other members of Mr. Christie\u2019s inner circle who he said had known well before it became public that the lane closings had been intended as retaliation against the mayor. Among them was a confidant of the governor\u2019s, David Samson, then the chairman of the Port Authority. He came later to the conversation at the Sept. 11 memorial, according to the testimony and photographs presented in court. As he did, Mr. Samson told Mr. Christie that another Democratic mayor, Steven Fulop of Jersey City, was pressing him to meet to discuss Port Authority business, Mr. Wildstein recalled. But the Christie administration was mad at Mayor Fulop as well, for not endorsing the governor. The governor, Mr. Wildstein said, had previously ordered his administration to cancel a day\u2019s worth of meetings intended to help introduce the mayor to administration officials who could help him. \u201cGovernor Christie said no, no meetings with Mayor Fulop,\u201d Mr. Wildstein testified. \u201cHe\u2019s not getting any responses from the administration, just like Mayor Sokolich wasn\u2019t. \u201d Two days later, Mr. Wildstein testified, Mr. Samson reassured Mr. Baroni that he would help \u201cretaliate\u201d against a New York official who had ordered the lanes reopened. Two months later, when Mr. Christie had won   but reporters were continuing to pose questions about the lane closings, Mr. Wildstein met with Michael DuHaime, the governor\u2019s political strategist. Mr. Wildstein testified that he told Mr. DuHaime that he had directed the scheme, and that Mr. Baroni was involved, along with Ms. Kelly and Bill Stepien, the governor\u2019s campaign manager. He also told Mr. DuHaime that he had told Mr. Christie about it on Sept. 11. \u201cI told him that we had discussed it with Governor Christie and that Governor Christie seemed to be enjoying it,\u201d Mr. Wildstein testified. \u201cMr. DuHaime was upset with me,\u201d he added. \u201cHe thought this had been a very bad idea. \u201d He recalled Mr. DuHaime\u2019s saying, \u201cI wish you had spoken with me I would have told you not to do it. \u201d Mr. Wildstein said he told Mr. DuHaime that he was willing to resign \u201cso the story might go away\u201d and others would not get in trouble. \u201cMr. DuHaime did not think the story would reach that level,\u201d Mr. Wildstein testified. \u201cHe did not think the story would go as bad as it did. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562220.958741}
