And a   believer finds the truth at a pizza parlor.  Al Gore thought he would be bending the ear of the adviser Mr. Trump trusts most, his daughter Ivanka. Instead, the man bearing \u201cThe Inconvenient Truth\u201d went straight to the source: the   himself. \u201cI had a lengthy and very productive session with the \u201d Mr. Gore, the former vice president, told reporters at Trump Tower. \u201cIt was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the   Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued. \u201d Hundreds of scientists are also telling Mr. Trump in a new letter that climate change is real and needs to be addressed: \u201cWe urge you to decide if you want your presidency to be defined by denial and disaster, or acceptance and action,\u201d says the new letter, which will be sent on Tuesday and has already been signed by 700 scientists and academics from related disciplines. The letter lists six steps the   can take to help protect the nation\u2019s \u201ceconomy, national security, and public health and safety. \u201d Getting Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, to turn around on the issue might not be as unlikely as his public statements would make it seem. It may come down to who has his ear last. It must have felt familiar to Mr. Gore, confronting a   who had just lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College. In point of fact, Mr. Gore\u2019s loss to George W. Bush pales in comparison with Hillary Clinton\u2019s. If you\u2019re still counting, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s popular vote lead over Mr. Trump climbed to 2, 597, 156 over the weekend, five times Mr. Gore\u2019s final lead over Mr. Bush. And at 2 percentage points, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead has equaled Jimmy Carter\u2019s victory spread over Gerald Ford in 1976. On Tuesday, House Democrats will convene a forum on the \u201cElectoral College and the Future of American Democracy. \u201d No word on whether they will be picking up the tab to move Californians to Florida and Ohio. The electoral recriminations keep rolling in. A former Breitbart News reporter claimed last night on Facebook that he planted Clinton hecklers at her rallies, and has since deleted the post. The gunman who stormed a Washington pizzeria on Sunday confirmed that he was motivated by online articles that convinced him that the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, \u201cwas harboring sex slaves\u201d and that he was \u201carmed to help rescue them,\u201d according to documents released at his arraignment. After the suspect, Edgar M. Welch, \u201cfound no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant,\u201d he surrendered peacefully, the documents said. The truth now known, perhaps Mr. Welch could tell the son of the  \u2019s pick for national security adviser, who said on Twitter: Also, if he had kept his assault rifle stashed, the gunman could have enjoyed a pizza and a beer, but we Washingtonians understand the wait for a   table can be pretty long. The House majority leader said a   Congress would not support the  \u2019s vow to hit companies that move overseas with a hefty tariff on goods sent back to the United States. And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan hinted strongly that he wouldn\u2019t go along either. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into some kind of trade war,\u201d Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, said in response to vehement threats by Mr. Trump over the weekend. Mr. Ryan echoed Mr. McCarthy\u2019s view that an overhaul of the corporate tax code would better keep jobs in the United States than a punitive tariff on companies that send work abroad. \u201cI think we can get at the goal here, which is keep American businesses American, build things in America and sell them overseas. That can be properly addressed in comprehensive tax reform,\u201d the speaker told a Wisconsin reporter. In a storm of Twitter posts over the weekend, the   had been uncompromising on the proposal. An umbrella organization of Jewish groups is holding a Hanukkah party at the new Trump International Hotel in Washington, and one of its member groups is not too happy about it. \u201cIn the years to come, Jews in America are going to be regularly tested to make the right choices, and this is clearly not one of them,\u201d wrote Peter Pepper and Ann Toback, the president and executive director of the Workmen\u2019s Circle, in a letter to Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. In a telephone interview, Mr. Hoenlein said that the venue choice had been made by the partner for the party, the Azerbaijani Embassy, and that it was one of the few places that would hold a kosher reception on short notice. \u201cThere\u2019s no other significance to it,\u201d Mr. Hoenlein said, adding that Mr. Trump is not yet president, \u201cso there\u2019s no conflict. \u201d Of course, that partner, Azerbaijan, isn\u2019t terribly popular either. Mr. Trump has a message to the news media: Cover him the way he wants or he\u2019ll just have to keep tweeting  \u2014   regardless of the consequences. The  \u2019s victory tour started with a bang in Cincinnati when he took a shot at Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and prompted the crowd into another round of \u201cLock her up\u201d by saying how much he enjoyed beating up on Mrs. Clinton. The next dates are out: \u25a0 Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N. C. at 7 p. m. Tuesday \u25a0   Hall in Des Moines at 7 p. m. Central time Thursday. \u25a0 DeltaPlex Arena in Grand Rapids, Mich. at 7 p. m. Friday Retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis may have led the 1st Marine Division during the invasion of Iraq and later oversaw the campaign for Falluja, but he now thinks the Iraq War was a mistake. \u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d the  \u2019s choice to be secretary of defense told a conference in California, according to an audio tape obtained by The Intercept, \u201cwe will probably look back on the invasion of Iraq as a mistake  \u2014   as a strategic mistake. \u201d Perhaps not coincidentally, Mr. Trump  \u2014   his boss, should he be confirmed by the Senate  \u2014   had a similar change of views on the war, though the   has famously insisted he always opposed the invasion. Several groups who favor limiting immigration are voicing their opposition to Representative Michael McCaul as a potential secretary of homeland security, saying the Texas Republican has been weak on border security. Mr. McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has been a frequent critic of what he says is the Obama administration\u2019s failure to adequately combat the Islamic State. But groups like the Center for Immigration Studies say Mr. McCaul\u2019s efforts on border security and immigration have been weak and counterproductive. \u201cHe\u2019s been the chairman of this critical committee and never tried to push through legislation that adequately addresses border security, immigration and homeland security,\u201d said Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the center. The real aim may be less about opposing Mr. McCaul than opening a lane for the group\u2019s homeland security chief of choice: Mr. Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state. The Federation for American Immigration Reform did not directly oppose Mr. McCaul but said the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security needed to be someone who would implement real border and immigration security. \u201cIf Representative McCaul is chosen to head D. H. S. he will need to take a much more expansive view of border and immigration enforcement than he has in the past,\u201d said Dan Stein, the president of the federation.'"}, "time": 1742564522.913078}
