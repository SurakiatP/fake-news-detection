Barbra Streisand \\n\\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m either coming to your country if you\u2019ll let me in, or Canada,\u201d the singer told 60 Minutes in an interview in August. Streisand has been a vocal supporter of Clinton\u2019s candidacy, and appeared at a high-profile fundraiser for the candidate in New York City earlier this year.\\n2. Bryan Cranston \\n\\n\u201cI would definitely move. It\u2019s not real to me that that would happen. I hope to God it won\u2019t,\u201d Cranston said in October of the possibility of a Trump victory. The Breaking Bad star suggested he would take a permanent vacation to Vancouver.\\n3.

Jon Stewart \\n\\nThe former Daily Show funnyman may want to connect with billionaire space pioneer Elon Musk if Trump wins; he told People magazine last year that he would consider \u201cgetting in a rocket and going to another planet, because clearly this planet\u2019s gone bonkers.\u201d\\n7.

That\u2019s not the president I want. Find a way to make stuff work.\u201d\\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for me to move, you know. I can afford to go,\u201d she added.\\n11. Neve Campbell \\n\\nThe Scream and House of Cards actress said she would move back to her native Canada if Trump wins the election.\\n\u201cThey see someone off the cuff and broad, and they think \u2018ok, that\u2019s the voice we need, just someone honest,\u2019\u201d Campbell told the Huffington Post of the motivation behind the Republican candidate\u2019s support. \u201cBut his honesty is terrifying.\u201d\\n12.
