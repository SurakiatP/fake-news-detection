Esquire editor answers own question by naming and shaming Posted at 7:53 pm on October 26, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nAs Twitchy reported, cameras were out in force on campus last weekend to capture some door-to-door vote canvassing by young celebrities like nasty woman Katy Perry, 32, and Miley Cyrus. \\nIt\u2019s no surprise both were trying to coax millennials to vote for Hillary Clinton. But what about Taylor Swift, asked no one? Hang on one second; someone did ask. In a piece published by Esquire Wednesday, editor Matt Miller asks , \u201cWhy are influential celebrities remaining silent this election?\u201d Taylor Swift has 156,147,879 social media followers. Why is she remaining politically silent? https://t.co/SRqu5kNo1r \\n\u2014 John Hendrickson (@JohnGHendy) October 26, 2016 \\nWhy do these select entertainers get to keep their political opinions to themselves? \u201cMaybe these artists are protecting their brand?\u201d Miller posits, adding, \u201cFuck that! If their brand means to sacrifice the very values that make them human and a contributing member of this society, then they live a sad, hollow life.\u201d \\nBefore making some remark about Taylor Swift being a singer and not a politician, consider this: Taylor Swift is not a private citizen. Her opinion matters to more people than Paul Ryan's opinion ever will. \\n\u2014 John Hendrickson (@JohnGHendy) October 26, 2016 \\nSomeone\u2019s living a sad, hollow life. Though Miller wrote the piece, Esquire deputy editor John Hendrickson took most of the heat for it after publicizing the article by tweeting quotes from it. @JohnGHendy @esquire Because she's a pop star and not a political pundit? What do I win? \\n\u2014 Randy Wortinger (@randicus79) October 26, 2016 Maybe because she wants to sell music to both sides, you simpleton. @JohnGHendy @esquire \\n\u2014 Yes, Nick $earcy! (@yesnicksearcy) October 26, 2016 @JohnGHendy @esquire Because this is one of the most divisive elections of all time and she doesn't want to alienate 1/2 of her audience.\""}, "time": 1742562187.7765174}
