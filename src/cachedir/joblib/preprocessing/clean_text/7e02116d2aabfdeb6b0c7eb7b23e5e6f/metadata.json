Hillary Clinton\u2019s diagnosis of pneumonia has grounded her for a few days and shifted the focus of the presidential race to the candidates\u2019 health. Mrs. Clinton, 68, and Donald Trump, 70, have promised to release more detailed information from their doctors. The issue isn\u2019t just their state of vigor but whether they operate with more insularity than transparency. Mr. Trump also demanded that Mrs. Clinton apologize for calling some of his supporters \u201cdeplorables\u201d and released an ad showcasing the remarks on national cable and in four battleground states. _____ 2. President Obama will veto a bill that would allow the families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the plot, the White House said. Since both the House and Senate passed the legislation with majorities, the president could face the first veto override of his presidency. He also met with congressional leaders, above, to discuss measures needed to finance the government after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, since lawmakers have not agreed on a budget. _____ 3. The U. N. secretary general, Ban   is racing to get the Paris climate agreement into effect  \u2014   possibly even before the U. S. election. The pact goes into force when 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions formally sign on, conditions that are more than halfway met. The world\u2019s three largest emitters  \u2014   the U. S. China, above and Brazil  \u2014   are on board. This year is shaping up to be the third consecutive hottest on record, and some scientists warn that the oceans\u2019 ability to absorb excess heat has masked the scale of the problem. These graphics lay out the issues. _____ 4. The N. C. A. A. made a surprise announcement: All its championships are being moved from North Carolina for this academic year because the state passed laws the group said violated the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The N. B. A. already moved next February\u2019s   Game from Charlotte, and stars like Bruce Springsteen and Itzhak Perlman have canceled concerts in the state. _____ 5. Florida\u2019s offer of free Zika testing for pregnant women has increased rather than decreased their anxieties. That\u2019s because so many responded that state labs are overwhelmed, and the wait for results can stretch to six weeks, complicating already difficult decisions about possibly terminating pregnancies. Above, workers went door to door to take blood samples. _____ 6. Colin Kaepernick, above right, and his teammate Eric Reid knelt during the national anthem before the San Francisco 49ers played their first game of the season against the Los Angeles Rams (10:20 p. m. Eastern, ESPN). Kaepernick\u2019s refusal to stand for the anthem to protest racial injustice has emboldened players on other teams  \u2014   and in other sports  \u2014   to make their own symbolic gestures of dissent. Such moves have been rare, in part because athletes are often preoccupied with team morale and financial and branding issues. _____ 7. If you\u2019re forever playing   our television experts can speed you along. Their list of the best shows that emerged over the summer includes some of contenders for Emmys on Sunday, including the documentary series \u201cO. J.: Made in America\u201d (ESPN). There\u2019s also \u201cStranger Things,\u201d above, an oddly straightforward horror story set in 1983. Our experts also suggest a few newbies, like Amazon\u2019s promising pilots \u201cI Love Dick\u201d and the reboot of \u201cThe Tick. \u201d _____ 8. Feel whipsawed by the shift in the last few years from demonizing fat for health problems to blaming sugar? Historical documents discovered by a researcher show that the sugar industry paid several Harvard scientists in the 1960s to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and promote saturated fat as the culprit instead. \u201cThey were able to derail the discussion about sugar for decades,\u201d said a medical professor who helped bring the case to light. _____ 9. The Syrian   called for in an agreement by the U. S. and Russia had an uneven start. Violations were reported in the north and south of the country shortly after it went into effect. The timing coincided with Eid   the Muslim Feast of the Sacrifice, which commemorates a story central to Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Abraham\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his son at God\u2019s behest. One Syrian activist, pessimistic that the   would make any difference in the conflict, posted on Facebook: \u201cand they gathered like sheep in front of the guillotine. \u201d _____ 10. Millions of people are flowing over   paths in Saudi Arabia for the annual hajj. One of them is our Mideast reporter Diaa Hadid, and she\u2019s sending dispatches, videos and photos to help demystify the pilgrimage for  . There are little prayer counters, like spiritual Fitbits shopping sprees ritual haircuts and moments of great kindness, like being sprayed under a sweltering sun with the last ounces of water from strangers\u2019 bottles. _____ 11. Finally, this may hearten many Medicare beneficiaries: Claims for skilled nursing, home health care or outpatient therapy are not supposed to be rejected just because a patient has ceased to improve. In fact, a federal judge has ordered supervisors to do a better job of making that clear to health care providers and claims adjudicators. The actual rule is that Medicare must approve such services when they are \u201cnecessary to maintain the patient\u2019s current condition or prevent or slow further deterioration. \u201d _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
