Prosecutors said the operation had moved at least 200 tons of cocaine into the United States, had earned $14 billion in profits and had been protected by an army of assassins who killed thousands of people. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s arraignment, in Federal District Court, was both a news media spectacle and a pro forma counterpoint to his sudden extradition from Mexico on Thursday afternoon, when a police jet flew him from the border to MacArthur Airport in Islip, on Long Island. The brief court proceeding took place under tight security, with police vehicles, heavily armed guards and   dogs patrolling the grounds outside the courthouse. Dressed for his arraignment in a blue     blue pajama pants and blue sneakers, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, 59, stood with his   lawyers in front of Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in a   courtroom packed with prosecutors, federal agents and reporters. \u201cAre you Mr. Guzm\u00e1n?\u201d Judge Orenstein asked the defendant. \u201cS\u00ed, se\u00f1or,\u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n said. The judge then asked Mr. Guzm\u00e1n if he understood the charges he was facing. \u201cS\u00ed, se\u00f1or,\u201d he said again. Those charges had been detailed earlier on Friday at a news conference. At the briefing, Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, called the extradition of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, whose nickname means Shorty, a milestone in the pursuit of a trafficker who achieved mythic status in his homeland as a Robin   outlaw and a serial prison escapee. Saying that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n now faced life in prison on a charge of running a continuing criminal enterprise, Mr. Capers sought to play down Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s role as a folk hero and promised that he would not escape his American jailers. \u201cWho is Chapo Guzm\u00e1n?\u201d Mr. Capers said, flanked by a phalanx of   officials from local, state and federal agencies. \u201cIn short, he is a man who has known no other life than one of crime, violence, death and destruction. \u201d Even at a courthouse that has seen the prosecution of Mafia dons like John J. Gotti, the onetime Gambino family boss, and corrupt public officials like Meade Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic leader, the arrival of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n sent a charge through the building, where scores of international reporters were on hand. In an extraordinary confluence of events, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was taken from Mexico by plane on the eve of the inauguration of Donald J. Trump and was arraigned in Brooklyn only hours after Mr. Trump was sworn in. After the hearing, he was returned to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, a   federal jail that has housed some of New York\u2019s   federal defendants, including many facing terrorism charges. As the day began, prosecutors in Brooklyn issued a memo laying out their arguments for keeping Mr. Guzm\u00e1n in custody. They noted his vast wealth and asserted his propensity for violence and his penchant for escaping Mexican prisons  \u2014   most notably, the   Altiplano prison, where he lived in isolation under   surveillance. Nonetheless, he managed to flee after his associates dug a tunnel directly into his shower. Speaking at the news conference, Angel M. Melendez, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security investigations in New York, said he had been at the airport Thursday night when Mr. Guzm\u00e1n arrived. Mr. Melendez said he looked into Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s eyes and saw \u201csurprise, shock and even a bit of fear\u201d now that he was facing \u201cAmerican justice. \u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s escapes in Mexico came while he was serving a long sentence on   offenses. Although officials at the gathering refused to discuss details about security measures, Mr. Melendez said, \u201cI can assure you no tunnel will be built to his bathroom. \u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n is facing charges in six federal districts, and Mr. Capers said the decision had been made to prosecute him in Brooklyn, with the assistance of federal prosecutors in Miami, because the two offices working together could bring \u201cthe most forceful punch\u201d to the case against the leader of the Sinaloa cartel. Mr. Capers added that cases in Texas, in California, in Illinois and elsewhere would, for the moment, remain open. The investigation into Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s crimes was conducted by a host of agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In its memo filed Friday, Mr. Capers\u2019s office said it would seek a criminal forfeiture of $14 billion against Mr. Guzm\u00e1n and announced that it planned to call dozens of witnesses to testify about the staggering scope of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s criminal enterprise: its   shipments of drugs in trucks, planes, yachts, fishing vessels, container ships and submersibles, as well as its numerous killings of witnesses, law enforcement agents, public officials and rival cartel members. The memo also said the government had a vast array of physical evidence, including seized drug stashes and electronic surveillance recordings. The   memorandum of law  \u2014   supplemented with photographs of seized drugs and the planes, boats and submersibles used to smuggle them  \u2014   reads like a history of the modern narcotics business. Prosecutors contend that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n transformed the drug trade with unchecked brutality, remarkable efficiency and brazen corruption. The document tracks his progression from the 1980s, as a smuggler who transported Colombian cocaine to the United States and returned the profits to traffickers there so efficiently that he earned the nickname El R\u00e1pido, through the \u201990s, when he began consolidating his control in Mexico. As Colombian traffickers faced increased enforcement of extradition laws, and thus greater threat of prosecution in the United States, they ceded elements of the distribution networks in the United States to Mexican cartels, according to the memo. As Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s operations grew, prosecutors say, they became increasingly sophisticated. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n also established a complex communications network to allow him to speak covertly with his growing empire without detection by law enforcement, according to the memo. This included \u201cthe use of encrypted networks, multiple insulating layers of   and   methods of communicating with his workers. \u201d Mr. Guzm\u00e1n also established distribution networks in New York, New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Texas and California and created \u201cmassive   efforts that delivered billions of dollars in illegal profits generated from the cocaine sales in the United States to the Mexican traffickers and their Colombian partners,\u201d the memo said. \u201cThese changes,\u201d it added, \u201cenabled Guzm\u00e1n to exponentially increase his profits to staggering levels. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564465.516232}
