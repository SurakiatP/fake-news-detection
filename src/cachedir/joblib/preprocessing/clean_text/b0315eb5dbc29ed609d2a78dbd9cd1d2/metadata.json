[The   Democrat candidate for president has been solidly behind Minnesota Congressman and Muslim Keith Ellison, but recently a swell of support for former Obama Labor Secretary Tom Perez has been seen among many Democrats turned off by Ellison\u2019s laudatory comments about Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. One of Perez\u2019 newest and biggest supporters is no less than from former Vice President Joe Biden.  This week Biden came out with a formal endorsement of Perez, giving the former Obama appointee his biggest boost yet in the hunt for the Chairmanship of the Democrat National Committee. But in a February 1 Facebook post, Sanders slammed Biden and his endorsement saying it is only another example of the \u201cfailed   approach\u201d to lead the party. \u201cJoe Biden is a friend of mine and I have a lot of respect for Tom Perez. In terms of the next chair of the DNC, however, the question is simple,\u201d Sanders wrote in his post. \u201cDo we stay with a failed   approach or do we go forward with a fundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party? I say we go forward and create a grassroots party which speaks for working people and is prepared to stand up to the top 1 percent. That\u2019s why we have to support Keith Ellison. \u201d Sanders\u2019 divisive approach runs contrary to his own candidate\u2019s claims to want to bring the Democrat Party together. But many Democrats are even wondering why Sanders thinks he has a say in the matter since he has steadfastly refused to even join the Democrat Party in the first place. Texas Democratic chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, for instance, said Sanders\u2019 meddling was \u201cvery concerning,\u201d The Hill reported. \u201cIt is very concerning that Bernie Sanders is so intent on taking over a party that he\u2019s not even a member of  \u2014   that he\u2019d insult the beloved vice president  \u2014   and really the president  \u2014   about a failed status quo approach,\u201d Hinojosa said. The Texan went on to wonder why Sanders should even be concerning himself with the race for party chair. \u201cThis is coming from a man who is not even a member of our party,\u201d Hinojosa said. \u201cWe lost an election and all of a sudden we\u2019re all a part of a failed status quo? When he puts Joe Biden and Tom Perez in this category and paints with a broad brush he insults all of us. This is an election between loyal, qualified Democrats who love our party and the country. There\u2019s no need for him to lower himself to that level. \u201d Democrat strategist Jamal Simmons agreed, according to the paper. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get to set the standard for a party he\u2019s not a member of,\u201d Simmons said. DNC vice chairman R. T. Rybak also questioned Sanders\u2019 rhetoric, saying that the next party chairman needs to be \u201clooking forward, not back. \u201d Other Democrats lashed out at Sanders for his \u201cegoism\u201d and for attempting to open up old primary wounds. One Clinton ally reportedly griped, \u201cHe\u2019s opening these old wounds and it looks to me also like his ego is at play. Perez and Ellison are cut from the same progressive cloth. Either one would be a strong leader. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742563826.8503425}
