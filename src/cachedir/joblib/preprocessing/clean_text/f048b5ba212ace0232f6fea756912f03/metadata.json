This planet is called Nibiru (although Jupiter was the planet associated with the god Marduk in Babylonian cosmology).According to Sitchin, Nibiru (whose name was replaced with MARDUK in original legends by the Babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co-opt the creation for himself, leading to some confusion among readers) collided catastrophically with Tiamat (a goddess in the Babylonian creation myth the En\u00fbma Eli\u0161), which he considers to be another planet once located between Mars and Jupiter. This collision supposedly formed the planet Earth, the asteroid belt, and the comets. Sitchin states that when struck by one of planet Nibiru\u2019s moons, Tiamat split in two, and then on a second pass Nibiru itself struck the broken fragments and one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt. The second half, struck again by one of Nibiru\u2019s moons, was pushed into a new orbit and became today\u2019s planet Earth.\\n\\n\\nAccording to Sitchin, Nibiru (called \u201cthe twelfth planet\u201d because, Sitchin claimed, the Sumerians\u2019 gods-given conception of the Solar System counted all eight planets, plus Pluto, the Sun and the Moon) was the home of a technologically advanced human-like extraterrestrial race called the Anunnaki in Sumerian myth, who Sitchin states are called the Nephilim in Genesis. He wrote that they evolved after Nibiru entered the solar system and first arrived on Earth probably 450,000 years ago, looking for minerals, especially gold, which they found and mined in Africa. Sitchin states that these \u201cgods\u201d were the rank-and-file workers of the colonial expedition to Earth from planet Nibiru.\\n\\nThere is a lot of confusion about the origin of the word Nephilim and what it means. In Hebrew it literally means to fall. As in fallen angel. The Bible, the Talmud and the Koran (where they are referred to as Djinn) all speak of fallen angels. \\n\\nIn the Book of Genesis in the Bible it relates how the Nephilim produced children with humans. One was even depicted as killing Japheth, Noah\u2019s son, and taking his place whereupon he fathered many children with Japheth\u2019s unsuspecting wife which eventually populated much of Northern Europe.\\n\\nIn the following video, journey into the world of Fallen Angels, Satan, Shadow People, Aliens, Demons, Anunnaki, Archons, Ancient Giants, \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d & Genetic Hybrids. Almost all of what we know about the Nephilim comes from the Holy Bible in Genesis Chapter 6. If you\u2019ve studies or looked into the Nephilim at all, or even if you haven\u2019t, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find the video below refreshingly different than many other videos on the topic. I certainly did, and I\u2019ve seen a ton. \\n\\nWATCH THE VIDEO: \\n\\nLocklip \\nSOURCE '"}, "time": 1742561903.704308}
