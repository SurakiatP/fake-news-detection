That is the only option available to losers, as they have taught us all so well over the last few months. \\n\u201cOf course, they might want to try and overthrow the democratic rule of law, but then we might find we get some new portmanteaus like \u2018crying Brexitears\u2019 and \u2018throwing a Brexitantrum\u2019.\u201d Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!
