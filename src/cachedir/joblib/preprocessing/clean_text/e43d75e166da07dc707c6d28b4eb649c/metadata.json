The new target, while only a bit lower than last year\u2019s, continues a long streak of China trying to dampen expectations as the country grapples with thorny problems like the maturing of its economy, its considerable industrial overcapacity, a growing debt load and pernicious pollution problems. At the meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, China addressed issues such as pollution, debt and foreign policy. Li Keqiang, China\u2019s premier, called on Sunday for economic growth this year of \u201caround 6. 5 percent or higher, if possible,\u201d slightly more modest than last year\u2019s target of 6. 5 to 7 percent. Actual growth last year, according to official data, was 6. 7 percent. Even with the slight drop in projected growth, many economists argue that China\u2019s annual target remains too ambitious and is adding to its   problems. But Mr. Li defended the target. \u201cThe projected target for this year\u2019s growth is realistic,\u201d Mr. Li said in a report issued on Sunday before lawmakers convened. \u201cAn important reason to stress the need for stable growth is to ensure employment and improve people\u2019s lives. \u201d In a separate report issued to the legislature, the National Development and Reform Commission  \u2014   which helps steer the economy  \u2014   said the growth target was meant to reassure the public at an anxious time. Later this year, the Chinese Communist Party will undergo a leadership   and officials have said that stability is essential. \u201cThis rate of growth is conducive to fostering healthy public expectations,\u201d the commission report said. China, it added, was \u201cfacing complex and volatile\u201d conditions this year. Since the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, China has rapidly expanded debt to stimulate the economy and to make sure that it hit fairly ambitious targets for economic growth. Reformers have called for lower targets that would not require so much debt to achieve. Mr. Li also tried to reassure a public that has grown increasingly angry about noxious air, water and soil left by decades of feverish industrial growth, and burning coal is a main culprit. \u201cWe will work faster to address pollution caused by coal burning,\u201d Mr. Li said. Those steps would include trying to cut the amount of coal used for winter furnaces and heaters. \u201cAll key sources of industrial pollution will be placed under    online monitoring,\u201d he said. But China\u2019s appetite for coal remains enormous. Mr. Li said that China would keep cutting excess coal production this year, but more slowly than previously. He said that this year the government aimed to shut down at least 150 million metric tons of coal production. Last year, he said, the government cut 290 million tons. In terms of other pollutants, Mr. Li said that sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions would be cut 3 percent this year and that fine particles of pollution in the air, which are of particular threat to health, would decrease \u201cmarkedly\u201d in \u201ckey areas. \u201d He also said that energy consumption would decline by 3. 4 percent per unit of economic output  \u2014   a calculation that will still allow increases in emissions of global warming gases. Mr. Li did not mention President Trump, whose campaign language suggested a tougher stance against China on trade and regional issues. These annual reports by China\u2019s prime minister are traditionally used for laying out generalities, not specific policies. But Mr. Li built on an effort by the president, Xi Jinping, to promote China as a reassuringly stable and mature power in uncertain times. \u201cIn the face of profound changes in the international political and economic landscape, China will always be on the side of peace and stability,\u201d he said. On trade, Mr. Li said China will continue to oppose protectionism. \u201cEconomic globalization is in the fundamental interests of all countries,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cChina will not shift in its commitment to promoting global economic cooperation. \u201d But Chinese officials were circumspect about the government\u2019s latest increase in military spending. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for the National People\u2019s Congress, Fu Ying, told reporters that the rise would be about 7 percent. But the documents released at the opening of the legislative meeting left people guessing about the exact size of China\u2019s official defense budget for 2017, unlike previous years. Credit in China grew about 20 percent a year between 2009 and 2015, and the level of corporate debt in particular has alarmed economists who worry about a rising number of bad bank loans. Mr. Li said that the government was looking to lower debt loads in the economy from a splurge of bank lending, but he suggested it would be done a \u201cprudent\u201d way that would not risk an economic shock. But the Ministry of Finance budget report, issued alongside Mr. Li\u2019s report, outlined a tougher approach to local governments that have collected debt to pay for infrastructure. \u201cHigher priority will be given to preventing and controlling local government debt,\u201d the budget report said. Provincial governments would develop \u201clocal contingency plans\u201d to deal with debt risks, it said. Foreign companies have become increasingly vocal about business barriers, intellectual property theft and other problems in the Chinese market. Some are turning elsewhere to establish a base for production. Mr. Li held out an olive branch, promising to \u201cmake big moves to improve the environment for foreign investors. \u201d He said that service industries, manufacturing and mining would become more open to these investors. He also promised that, contrary to most expectations and previous experience, foreign companies would not be discriminated against on license applications, setting standards or government procurement. The country has laid out plans  \u2014   called the Made in China 2025 initiative  \u2014   for it to seize a global lead in a long list of key   and manufacturing industries in the next eight years. Legislators gave polite applause to most of Mr. Li\u2019s plans. But one new policy drew vigorous clapping in a country where a national grid of   routes has quickly made   travel commonplace: Mr. Li said the government would end roaming charges on cellphones used outside the province in which the phone numbers were initially registered.'"}, "time": 1742628568.9733171}
