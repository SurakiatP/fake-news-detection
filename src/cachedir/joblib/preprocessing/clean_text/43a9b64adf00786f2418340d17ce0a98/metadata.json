Relatives were not informed of the deaths of their loved ones. The transfers of mentally ill patients were seen as business opportunities. Those were some of the findings of a South African government investigation published on Wednesday that determined that 94 psychiatric patients died of negligence last year after being moved by the authorities in Gauteng Province to facilities that were likened in some cases to concentration camps. The report prompted calls for criminal prosecutions. More than 1, 300 patients under state care were transferred last year from a unit of Life Healthcare Group, a private hospital group in South Africa, to 27 charitable organizations in an effort by the health department in the province to save money. Pretoria, the country\u2019s administrative capital, and Johannesburg are in Gauteng. The investigation was opened last September after 36 patients were found dead after being moved to some of the facilities operated by the charitable organizations. The report, by Professor Malegapuru W. Makgoba, the South African health ombudsman, found that the death toll was nearly 100, however. Investigators found facilities that were overcrowded and \u201cfull of hungry patients,\u201d adding that some were wearing pants held together with shoelaces. Other patients complained of rotten food and said they went weeks without medication. The decision to move the patients \u201cwas unwise and flawed,\u201d the report said, \u201cwith inadequate planning and a chaotic and rushed or hurried implementation process. \u201d All 27 of the organizations operated under invalid licenses, it said, so patients who were transferred there had died in \u201cunlawful circumstances. \u201d The authorities in Gauteng Province, along with some of the care centers, could not be reached for comment. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that only one person has died from a mental   illness,\u201d Professor Makgoba told local new outlets on Wednesday. The others died from \u201cthings like dehydration, diarrhea, epilepsy, heart attacks, all other things except mental illness. \u201d None of the care centers had professional doctors, nurses, psychiatrists or other therapists that normally cared for the patients, Professor Makgoba said in a separate interview on Thursday. \u201cYou have state patients in licensed institutions and you put them into unlicensed institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cI was shocked. \u201d The families of patients, as well as activists and psychiatrists, had vigorously opposed the plan to move the patients, arguing that it was dangerous to send them to facilities that were not equipped to handle them. Christopher Archer, of the South African Society of Psychiatrists, one of the groups that opposed the transfers, said that it was clear that \u201cprecipitous action had been taken without proper planning and these patients were moved prematurely before the facilities were property vetted. \u201d Public health services in South Africa are under enormous strain and severe budgetary constraints, Mr. Archer said in an interview. \u201cThere are more patients than there is money and this was considered a move to try to restrain public spending,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it turns out it was completely inappropriate. \u201d The head of the provincial government\u2019s health department, Qedani Mahlangu, resigned on Tuesday, just before the report was published, and there were mounting calls for David Makhura, the premier of Gauteng Province, to do the same. President Jacob Zuma thanked Professor Makgoba for his report, noting that it would help the government \u201censure that such a tragedy does not recur in the health sector,\u201d according to The Associated Press, but many South Africans said they were unconvinced. If 94 mental patients had died from official negligence in a \u201cnormal democracy,\u201d the entire national government would have been forced to resign, Barney Mthombothi, a former editor of Financial Mail, a South African business publication, wrote on Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742564487.1475716}
