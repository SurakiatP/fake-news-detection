They claimed 15 killed and 25 wounded, labeling the victims \u201capostates.\u201d \\nAfghan government officials put the toll a lot lower, saying only four were killed and seven wounded in the attack. Nangarhar is the main base of operations for ISIS forces in Afghanistan, though they\u2019ve recently begun to pop up around several other provinces. \\nWhether the council was at the point of establishing an anti-ISIS coalition or not, this is in keeping with the group\u2019s reaction to any sign of growing local resistance, with ISIS having similarly made an example of tribal groups in Iraq and Syria during their establishment there.
