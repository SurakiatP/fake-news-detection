President Donald Trump signals a deeper, spiritual battle that is taking place over America\u2019s soul. [Lou Engle, the founder of several Christian ministries, has highlighted two recent events that give cause for concern to Christians: the Women\u2019s March on Washington, with its close alliance with the U. S. abortion lobby, and recent calls to use witchcraft to \u201cbind\u201d and utterly destroy the president.  In an essay in Charisma Magazine, the charismatic leader of \u201cThe Call\u201d wrote that the Women\u2019s March \u201cwas the first shot across the bow, heralding a revolutionary rise against the president of the United States,\u201d and the fellow citizens who elected him. The March was also an uprising against \u201cthe foundational biblical truths upon which our nation was founded,\u201d Engle said. \u201cSoon after, the second shot was manifested publicly: an unprecedented global summons of witchcraft to curse President Trump, his Cabinet and all of those aligned with a biblical worldview,\u201d Engle wrote. \u201cSuddenly, the whole controversy was elevated to a global spiritual dimension, inaugurating a spiritual battle that cannot be won on the playing field of protests and political arguments. \u201d \u201cOnly the church has the answer to this unprecedented manifestation of witchcraft. Spiritual strategy must be used to overcome this   brazen challenge of the powers,\u201d he said. Understanding fierce ideological battles in spiritual terms is no novelty for Christians. As Saint Paul wrote some 2, 000 years ago, \u201cwe wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. \u201d In this battle, Engle sees great cause for hope, since many Americans do not identify with the anger, extremism and above all visceral hate being directed toward the president and those who voted for him. \u201cHundreds of thousands of women watched the March, heard the vitriol and could not identify with the radical ideologies being expressed that would not acknowledge God\u2019s Word and ways in the public controversy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis new woman declared deep inside her heart, This is not my revolution. \u201d Lou Engle is not alone in his analysis. Philadelphia Archbishop Charles J. Chaput recently expressed his astonishment at the mainstream media\u2019s ongoing war against Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to me how hostile the press is to everything the president does,\u201d Chaput told a radio talk show host last month. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be partisan in my comments here, but it seems to me if we are really serious about our common responsibilities, we support the president,\u201d Chaput said, adding that good citizens should \u201cwish him success rather than trying to undermine him. \u201d As a way of joining in the spiritual battle, Engle has proposed three days of fasting and prayer for the nation, beginning on Wednesday, March 8. In what he is calling an \u201cEsther fast,\u201d in commemoration of the Jewish heroine Esther, Engle invites the nation to fast and pray for three days leading up to the Jewish deliverance feast of Purim, which begins this year on Saturday evening, March 11. Among the many intentions of this Lenten \u201cEsther fast,\u201d Engle proposes that Christians and all people of good will pray in particular for the overturning of the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which, together with Doe v. Bolton, struck down existing abortion laws and granted abortion on demand for the full nine months of pregnancy for the entire country. Follow Thomas D.
