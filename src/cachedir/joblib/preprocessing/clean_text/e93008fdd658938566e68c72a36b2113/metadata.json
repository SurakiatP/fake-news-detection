She has a million stories. Trouble is, by the time she\u2019s finished, her time is up: \u201cGotta go!\u201d This leaves no room for me to share my news. So while I know her son\u2019s ACT scores, she wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you the first thing about my family. This has been going on for over a year. Is there a way to point out the imbalance that won\u2019t make me sound needy or her  ? VALERIE, CONN. I have a newish therapist, and I\u2019m going away for a spell this summer. So I asked if he would consider phone sessions. \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d he said, with a look that verged on repulsion. In his experience, patients on the phone often interpret silence as a signal to keep talking, leading to 50 minutes of blather. Perhaps this notion, combined with the fact that your    seems to be initiating all these calls, explains her conversational dominance. (Or maybe she\u2019s a narcissistic witch.) One idea: Try dialing the phone yourself. It\u2019s conceivable that your    will back off a little, and you will become \u201cCharles in Charge\u201d for the length of the calls that you place. If not, here\u2019s another: Though I have preached for years that we should pick up the phone at the first sign of trouble in our   do the opposite here. After your next   call, send her an email: \u201cYour story about Charlie\u2019s ACT\u2019s made me think of a funny one from when Sarah took them. Remind me to tell you when we next speak. \u201d Then do so at the beginning of your next call. She may get the hang of taking turns. Now, this advice is predicated on the assumption that your    is a good person with an annoying phone tic, and that normal attempts to jostle your way into the conversation have failed. But we may have different definitions of jostling. There\u2019s no crime in saying: \u201cHang on! You won\u2019t believe what your brother did,\u201d after she tells you a story about her husband. Not every conversationalist will lay out the red carpet for us. Sometimes we have to make our own breaks. My husband and I married last September. We have a surprising number of friends who attended the wedding but have not yet sent gifts. We had a small registry that sold out quickly, so some folks probably saw that it was sold out, made a mental note to buy something else, then forgot. It\u2019s not a big deal to us. But we\u2019re worried that some friends got us gifts that may have been lost at the wedding or in the mail, and they are now wondering why we haven\u2019t sent them   notes. What should we do? DAVID, NEW YORK I applaud the mental gymnastics of trying to turn your \u201csurprising number\u201d of    friends into victims of the United States Postal Service. (You and your hubby should head to Rio for spots on the Olympic tumbling squad.) For every package that is not delivered, millions are. And absent some catastrophic event at your wedding reception, I suspect you are in possession of all of the presents left for you there, too. Don\u2019t obsess over tiny risks. The trick here is turning your friends\u2019 attendance at your wedding into the big prize. Because that\u2019s all you\u2019re getting. Sorry. If you want to send them   notes for being part of your big day, knock yourself out. But it seems over the top to me. For what it\u2019s worth, your assessment of the situation  \u2014     registry leading to giftlessness  \u2014   seems about right. Next time, register for everything in sight. (Books, anyone?) I came across a travel package to Japan that sounded perfect for my husband and me. He mentioned it to his running buddy, who immediately said that he and his wife were in: \u201cWe\u2019d love to join you. \u201d Philip, they weren\u2019t invited! It\u2019s a   trip, and we\u2019ve never traveled together before. More important, they are not adventurous eaters, and I don\u2019t want to spend my limited travel time scouting for Americanized food in Asia. Fortunately, the trip was sold out. Now, another has come up, but I\u2019m afraid that Japan is off the table if we want to travel alone. Isn\u2019t it too risky to book the trip and try to keep it top secret? C. S. NEW JERSEY Has anyone else noticed that it seems to be masochist week at Social Q\u2019s? Don\u2019t let impromptu statements by your husband\u2019s running buddies dictate your travel schedule. Book your vacation and hold your head high. No need for secrecy. When your husband (inevitably) mentions the trip to his friend, coach him to say, \u201cWe decided to make it a second honeymoon and go alone. \u201d Your objections to   travels with this couple sound sensible, but no reason is required. Propose a long weekend to the Berkshires instead. (But only if you want to go with them.)'"}, "time": 1742564277.603568}
