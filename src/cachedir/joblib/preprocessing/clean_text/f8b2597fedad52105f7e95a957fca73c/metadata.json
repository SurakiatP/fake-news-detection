Then he offered a suggested quotation: \\n\u201cLike: I was there at the White House when Huma was a young intern, and now she\u2019s an integral part of the team. She\u2019s as multi-faceted as she is bright, and when you combine that with her humility, you couldn\u2019t ask for a better colleague.\u201d \\nMerrill tells Fisher, \u201cFeel free to tweak that, put it in John\u2019s voice, or blow it up.\u201d \\nFisher forwarded Merrill\u2019s email to Podesta, asking him if he\u2019d be willing to provide a quote. \u201cComms (communications) thinks it might lend an air of community to the piece,\u201d she wrote to Podesta. \\nPodesta\u2019s reply: \u201cChange bright to \u2018wicked smart\u2019 and after humilty add \u2018and strategic sense.'\u201d \\nThe complete email exchange, as provided by WikiLeaks, can be seen here : \\nThe July 2, 2015 Politico profile of Abedin described her as \u201cClinton\u2019s longest-serving aide.\u201d It said that \u201clike a mother monitoring her child on the playground, she never let Clinton drift out of her line of sight, ever vigilant and poised to act.\u201d Post navigation\""}, "time": 1742562929.2976797}
