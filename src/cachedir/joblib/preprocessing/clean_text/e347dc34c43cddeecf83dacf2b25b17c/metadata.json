The letter does not say that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. The letter states that emails were found that were pertinent to the email investigation while looking into an unrelated matter. \\nThe letter FBI Director Comey reads like what it is, an update on an investigation. The FBI is dotting the Is and crossing the Ts. Comey\u2019s letter destroys the Republican claim that there was a conspiracy to cover up Clinton\u2019s emails. Republicans, including Donald Trump, have spent months criticizing Comey\u2019s investigation, but it turns out that they were wrong. \\nIt would take something unprecedented and dramatic to change the FBI\u2019s original findings. Director Comey made it clear that the agency\u2019s work might not be completed before the election. \\nThe email story that Republicans and the media love, but voters have never cared about is back in the news, but it remains an empty scandal. \\nThe FBI\u2019s reopened investigation does open the door for Republicans to continue their bogus witch hunt if Hillary Clinton wins the White House. Unless voters want two more years of conspiracy investigations instead of action, today\u2019s developments have made voting for Democrats in House and Senate contests more vital than ever.'"}, "time": 1742628518.0807652}
