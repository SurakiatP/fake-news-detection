A revival of Lanford Wilson\u2019s \u201cBurn This,\u201d starring Mr. Gyllenhaal, that was scheduled to begin performances in February at a    Hudson Theater, is instead being postponed, the producers Stacey Mindich and Jessica R. Jenen said in a brief statement Friday evening. They said the postponement was \u201cdue to scheduling conflicts with the show\u2019s star,\u201d and that \u201cthe show is now aiming for its Broadway bow during the   season. \u201d Mr. Gyllenhaal, primarily known for his work on film, has appeared on Broadway once before, in \u201cConstellations,\u201d a   play by Nick Payne, which ran for three months in 2014 and 2015. The Ambassador Theater Group, which is reconverting the Hudson from a hotel event space into a theater, said it plans to announce another production soon. Mr. Gyllenhaal\u2019s fans, however, have another opportunity to see him onstage in New York: Next week he is scheduled to star in four concert performances of \u201cSunday in the Park with George\u201d at New York City Center.'"}, "time": 1742562193.73858}
