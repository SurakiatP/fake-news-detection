The UN aid chief and former Tory member of the British parliament Stephen O\u2019Brien set the tone by declaring himself \u201cincandescent with rage\u201d over the inability of the Security Council to take action. \u201cAleppo has essentially become a kill zone,\u201d he said. The fact that both Russian and Syrian warplanes have halted their strikes against the Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militias that control eastern Aleppo for the past 10 days was brushed aside by Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the United Nations, who represents the living embodiment of imperialist \u201chuman rights\u201d hypocrisy. Clueless Americans\u2019 tax dollars at work: Samantha Power doing her Neocon best to stir up further trouble for humanity. Taunting Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin, she declared. \u201cYou don\u2019t get congratulations and credit for not committing war crimes for a day or a week.\u201d Continuing her tirade, Power asked, \u201cDoes Russia believe that all of the children in eastern Aleppo are Al Qaeda members?\u201d Such outrage over the fate of civilians and children is highly selective. None of the representatives of US imperialism and its allies evinced even a spark of rage over the killing of men, women and children in government-controlled western Aleppo, which is regularly bombarded by mortars and rockets provided to the Al Qaeda \u201crebels\u201d by the Pentagon and the CIA. On Thursday, rocket fire claimed the lives of six children in the west of the city, where the vast majority of the population lives. Three Syrian children died at their school, where 14 other students were wounded. In a separate attack, three young brothers died when a rocket struck their home. Nor for that matter, as far as the human rights imperialists are concerned, can the slaughter of civilians in US air strikes elsewhere in Syria be compared in any way to the deaths caused by Russian bombs in Aleppo. Amnesty International issued a report Tuesday on 11 separate strikes by the US-led \u201ccoalition\u201d in which it said some 300 civilians were killed. The Pentagon has acknowledged only one death in these bombing raids. Other monitoring groups have put the civilian death toll inflicted by the US air war in Syria at well over 1,000. All told, the Pentagon admits to killing only 55 civilians in two years. Power\u2019s jibe that the Russians view every child in Aleppo as a member of Al Qaeda applies with equal force to the Pentagon, whose bombs apparently kill only members of ISIS. Power is herself a veteran practitioner of this kind of grotesque double standard. This crusader for human rights took the effective position that \u201cevery child in Gaza was a member of Hamas\u201d during the 51-day Israeli siege of 2013 that killed over 2,100 Palestinians and wounded another 11,000. During this one-sided slaughter, the US ambassador used her post at the UN to relentlessly proclaim Israel\u2019s right to \u201cdefend\u201d itself. Waving the filthy imperialist human rights banner, she was also one of the leading proponents of the US-NATO war in Libya that killed tens of thousands and left the country in ruins, as well as the war for regime change in Syria, which has killed over 300,000 and driven millions from their homes. T he hypocrisy and double standard of the war crimes denunciations against Russia over Aleppo emerges most starkly in relation to the launching earlier this month of a US-led siege of the Iraqi city of Mosul, just over 300 miles to the east, which was overrun by ISIS in 2014. While the Russians are indicted for turning Aleppo into a \u201ckill zone,\u201d the Western media routinely refers to the American onslaught as the \u201cliberation\u201d of Mosul. To that end, US warplanes, rocket launchers and heavy artillery are relentlessly pounding the city of over a million, which analysts acknowledge will be reduced to rubble. The head of the US military\u2019s Central Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, boasted in an interview with AFP that his forces had killed \u201c800 to 900 Islamic State fighters.\u201d He said not a word as to how many civilians had died under the US bombardment; nor has the US corporate media shown any interest in that subject. When one horrific incident did come to light\u2014the bombing of a Shia mosque near Kirkuk last Friday in which 17 women and children lost their lives and scores were wounded\u2014the Pentagon brushed it aside and the media largely ignored it. Even as US officials, parroted by the press, indict ISIS for using Mosul\u2019s population as \u201chuman shields\u201d\u2014a timeworn alibi for the slaughter of civilians\u2014they ignore and tacitly support Al Qaeda\u2019s use of terror and violence to prevent civilians from fleeing from the besieged neighborhoods of eastern Aleppo. While the actions carried out by the Russian military against the civilians trapped in eastern Aleppo are no doubt reprehensible, they are not the real concern of those screaming about war crimes. Their fear is that the Al Qaeda-linked militias that serve as the principal proxy force in the war for regime change are facing a final rout. Power trying to dragoon the UN Russian delegate, V. Churkin. Encouraged and rewarded by their hypocritical masters, the empire\u2019s goons know no limits to their audacious indecency. More fundamentally, the crimes of Russia[\u2014such as they are, and that, in itself needs careful contextual examination\u2014 Editors] in Aleppo pale in comparison to those carried out by Washington in the region, and for that matter, around the globe. Have those who feign shock and rage over the Russian bombs dropped on Syria forgotten \u201cshock and awe?\u201d The US invasion and occupation of Iraq took an estimated 1 million Iraqi lives. Are these champions of human rights unaware of the ongoing slaughter in Yemen, where over 10,000 people have died under Saudi airstrikes carried out with US supplied bombs and missiles and made possible by extensive intelligence and logistical aid from the Pentagon? Why is there no rage over a war by the ruling monarchy of the Middle East\u2019s wealthiest nation against the region\u2019s poorest, in which the systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure and a blockade imposed with the aid of US forces is threatening the population with starvation? When it comes to war crimes, the Kremlin oligarchy represented by Vladimir Putin is in the minor leagues. Since the end of World War II, and the US atomic bombs that killed some 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, virtually every US president has engaged in wars of military aggression that entailed war crimes, many of them on a scale surpassed only by the atrocities carried out by Hitler\u2019s Third Reich. The Korean War resulted in 3 million civilian deaths; in Vietnam, the US killed some 3 to 4 million civilians. Afghanistan\u2019s tragic and protracted encounter with US imperialism, dating back to the CIA-orchestrated war of regime change of the 1980s, claimed the lives of between 1.5 and 2 million more. Meanwhile, Washington remains at war in at least seven different countries, where civilian deaths continue to mount daily: Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. The source of the feigned rage and tears over Aleppo is the fact that the US war for regime change in Syria has turned into a debacle. Moscow launched its intervention in defense of the interests of Russia\u2019s ruling capitalist oligarchy, not those of the Syrian masses. Nonetheless, it has presented an obstacle to the US drive to assert its hegemony over the entire oil-rich region of the Middle East. The unrelenting \u201chuman rights\u201d propaganda and demonization of Russia over Aleppo stands as a warning. US imperialism is preparing a major escalation, not only of the US intervention in Syria, but of its confrontation with Russia itself, carrying with it the real and present danger of a nuclear war. \u2014Bill Van Auken'"}, "time": 1742564168.091605}
