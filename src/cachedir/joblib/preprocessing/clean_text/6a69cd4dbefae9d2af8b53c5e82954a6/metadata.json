Only 12 hours into Election Day and Eric Trump has already broken the law. \\nThe Trump family isn\u2019t known for their ability to follow the law. Eric Trump apparently decided to start off his day by voting for his narcissistic dad and then breaking the law by posting a picture of his completed ballot on Twitter. Image via Buzzfeed \\nThis just happens to violate New York election law. Oops. But hey, it\u2019s not like this has been a law for a long time right? Only 126 years. The law stipulates that any person who \u201c[s]hows his ballot after it is prepared for voting, to any person so as to reveal the contents \u2026 is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d \\nEric Trump was quickly notified that his tweet, featuring a pic of his ballot, was illegal. Image via Buzzfeed \\nThe law was recently challenged by a group of voters who asked a federal judge to issue an injunction that would allow voters to take ballot selfies. The judge denied their request, ruling on Nov. 3 that, \u201cThe public\u2019s interest in orderly elections outweighs the plaintiffs\u2019 interest in taking and posting ballot selfies.\u201d \\nAccording to the judge, the posting of ballot selfies would slow down the voting process, causing unnecessary delays, and threaten the guarantee of \u201celection integrity.\u201d \\nEric Trump eventually removed his tweet, but thanks to screenshots, it hasn\u2019t actually gone away. I have to ask at this point, can\u2019t these people get anything right? Seriously, they managed to screw up voting? By breaking the law? With Twitter ? Of course, they did. \\nFeatured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742628319.158141}
