[The former Olympic gold    TV star, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, challenged the president in a   interview with Diane Sawyer set to air Friday night.  \u201cYes, I did vote for Trump, but here\u2019s the deal breaker with the Republican party,\u201d Jenner told Sawyer, according to a preview clip of the interview released Friday. \u201cAnd the deal breaker is, you mess with my community, you do the wrong thing with our community, you don\u2019t give us equality and a fair shot, I\u2019m coming after you. \u201d Jenner told Sawyer that what the LGBT community needs from Republican legislators is \u201cfederal guidance,\u201d including on transgender service in the military. \u201cJust like the previous administration said that it was ok to serve as a trans person in the military,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cWe have frontline people, ok? I\u2019m talking Marines, trans guys, on the frontline, fighting for our country. I\u2019m trying to get, especially the Republican party, to make a change. \u201d Friday night\u2019s interview with Sawyer comes nearly two years to the day after Jenner first came out as a transgender woman in a 2015 interview with Sawyer. During that interview, Jenner said he had always leaned more conservative in his politics, identified as a Republican, and said he believed in the Constitution. Jenner spoke out in support of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, telling Stat magazine in June that the Republican candidate was better on LGBT issues than his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. \u201cEverybody looks at the Democrats as being better with these issues. But Trump seems to be very much for women,\u201d Jenner said at the time. Jenner also attended Trump\u2019s inauguration. But In February, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians and I Am Cait star criticized Trump for lifting federal guidelines concerning transgender bathroom use, calling the decision a \u201cdisaster. \u201d \u201cYou made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me,\u201d Jenner said in a video posted to Twitter. Jenner is set to release a book of memoirs, Secrets of My Life, next month. In an excerpt from the book published earlier this month, the reality star claimed to have undergone successful gender reassignment surgery in January, nearly a year and a half after first coming out as transgender. Jenner\u2019s interview with Sawyer airs Friday night at 10ET on ABC.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742562215.0319512}
