Trump on Monday for refusing to release his tax returns, asserting he had something to hide, and for misleading voters about his success as a businessman and ability to improve the American economy. Mr. Buffett, known to investors as the Sage of Omaha, said a monkey throwing darts at the stock pages in 1995, when Mr. Trump first offered stock in his Atlantic City hotels, would have come out far ahead of anyone who listened to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201csiren song\u201d and invested in his company that lost money year over year. The attack from perhaps the nation\u2019s most revered investor undercut a core argument of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy: that his success as a businessman qualified him to run the country despite his lack of political experience. Mr. Buffett appeared at a rally with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, in his hometown, Omaha. Taking on Mr. Trump, he pledged to personally transport 10 Nebraskans to the polls on Election Day on behalf of Mrs. Clinton and urged others to do the same. His appearance made him the latest billionaire to come out strongly against Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy  \u2014   after speeches by Michael R. Bloomberg at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia and by Mark Cuban over the weekend  \u2014   as Mrs. Clinton enlists their support to question Mr. Trump\u2019s business acumen. Mrs. Clinton was campaigning in Nebraska  \u2014   a traditionally Republican state  \u2014   as she sought to seize on momentum from the Democratic convention last week. On Monday, a CBS News poll, the first major national telephone survey after her nomination, showed her enjoying a bump since Republicans nominated Mr. Trump. They were tied at 42 percent after the Republican National Convention, but she now leads him, 46 percent to 39 percent. By campaigning in Nebraska, Mrs. Clinton was trying to pick up support in one of just two states that allocate electoral votes by congressional district. In 2008, Barack Obama won a single electoral vote in the state\u2019s Second District against Senator John McCain, though he lost it in 2012 in his more closely fought   race against Mitt Romney. In his address introducing Mrs. Clinton to the crowd, Mr. Buffett pointed out what most in the audience at a high school gym knew: that their votes could be disproportionately influential because of the state\u2019s peculiar Electoral College system. \u201cWe live in a very special place,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. Noting that Jonathan Karl of ABC News predicted on Sunday that the Electoral College could come down to a    tie, Mr. Buffett said, \u201cI am looking at the people that can change that 269 to 270. \u201d Mr. Buffett harshly criticized Mr. Trump for claiming that he had made \u201csacrifices\u201d by building buildings and working hard, an argument he made after Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of an Army captain killed in Iraq, said during a speech at the Democratic convention, that Mr. Trump had \u201csacrificed nothing\u201d for the country. Mr. Buffett said he, like Mr. Trump, had made a lot of money. \u201cI have not sacrificed,\u201d he told the rally. \u201cHow in the world can you stand up to a couple of parents who lost a son and talk about sacrificing because you were building a bunch of buildings?\u201d Mr. Buffett quoted a famous rejoinder to Senator Joseph McCarthy during his 1950s   hearings: \u201cHave you no sense of decency, sir?\u201d Mr. Trump was campaigning on Monday in Ohio and Pennsylvania, two swing states that Mrs. Clinton visited over the weekend and where Mr. Trump is pushing his   message hard. Although Mr. Romney won all but one of Nebraska\u2019s 93 counties four years ago, the Clinton campaign sees opportunity this election cycle. The Second District sent a Democrat, Representative Brad Ashford, to Congress in 2014, and he was one of the rare members of his party to unseat an incumbent during a Republican wave. Maine is the only other state to split its electoral votes. In a reverse image of Nebraska, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign hopes to pick up a vote in more conservative, rural northern Maine. The Clinton campaign hired a Nebraska state director about a month ago, when it also started spending precious resources on TV ads in the state. \u201cThere\u2019s serious dollars and I would say serious politicos who have been hired,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, the incoming chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party. At the Philadelphia convention, Ms. Kleeb helped mollify and motivate delegates supporting Senator Bernie Sanders, who carried the Nebraska caucuses during the primary race. More than 1, 000 people snaked back and forth in a parking lot to hear Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Buffett. Among those awaiting the speakers was Jim Magill, a retired chief master sergeant in the Air Force. A Republican, he said he supported Mrs. Clinton and did not believe Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to veterans. He was appalled, he said, about the Republican nominee\u2019s criticism of the Khans. \u201cIt was deplorable somebody would say anything like that about a veteran who died for his country to his parents,\u201d Mr. Magill said. \u201cHe should have been slapped. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563031.3730059}
