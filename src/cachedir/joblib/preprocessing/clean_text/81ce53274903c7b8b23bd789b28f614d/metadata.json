Podesta told her she\u2019d be shown a new poll showing how Clinton is doing against Hillary and Jeb Bush. \\nTanden said she wasn\u2019t familiar with what the poll results would be, but she thought the email would be rough, IJR is reporting . \\n\u201cPS can you imagine what the Republicans would do to [Bernie] if he were the nominee?\u201d \\nTo which Tanden replied: \\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what the poll actually says. \\nLet\u2019s hope the Democratic party is not suicidal.\u201d \\nThen Podesta dropped the hammer: \\n\u201cDo we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered? \\nLike whole thing is fucking insane.\u201d \"Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email?

They haven\u2019t confirmed their accuracy, but they certainly haven\u2019t denied them. It\\'s been 3 weeks since @WikiLeaks began publishing Podesta emails. Not one doc has been claimed \u2013 let alone demonstrated \u2013 to be doctored. \\n\u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 27, 2016 \\nThere\u2019s more coming. We will have to see what comes of them, but there\u2019s one takeaway from this: Clinton\u2019s people have known for a long time that she was using a personal server.'"}, "time": 1742561937.962886}
