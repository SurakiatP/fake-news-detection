What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at europebriefing@nytimes. com. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 The U. S. presidential race has opened a schism in the Republican Party. Donald J. Trump berated leading party members who have withdrawn support after a recording of him demeaning women in lurid terms became public. We take you inside the final weeks of Hillary Clinton\u2019s cautious  \u2014   and surprisingly risky  \u2014   campaign. \u201cI\u2019m the last thing standing between you and the apocalypse,\u201d she said in an interview.  \u2022 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has indefinitely postponed a trip to France after the French government said talks would be devoted solely to the Syrian crisis. The move came after President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, called for a war crimes inquiry. Mr. Johnson also called for protests outside the Russian Embassy in London. \u2022 A major terrorist attack in Germany was narrowly averted, the head of the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency said, after the arrest of a    Syrian refugee suspected of having ties to the Islamic State. The Islamic State\u2019s propaganda operations have dropped off drastically as military pressure rises. \u201cThey\u2019re dropping the utopian sales pitch they started with,\u201d a new study says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s hurting their recruiting effort. \u201d \u2022 Samsung has killed its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, an embarrassment for the tech giant.

She also expressed support for protesters demanding wider freedoms. At least 500 people have been killed in antigovernment demonstrations in the past year. Back in Berlin today, she is scheduled to meet with President Idriss D\u00e9by of Chad to discuss how to deal with Boko Haram and the waves of Africans trying to reach the Continent. \u2022 A Yemeni working for Unicef talks about raising his four children amid the country\u2019s violence. \u201cMy little boy will be 3 in December,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he is already three wars old. \u201d His    daughter wrote on Facebook, \u201cWe sleep afraid, we wake up afraid and leave our homes afraid. \u201d \u2022 Central banks, including the Bank of England, see Bitcoin\u2019s technology as another way to complete and record transactions, or even to issue their own currencies. \u2022 The World Health Organization urged countries to impose a 20 percent tax on sugary drinks to battle the growing obesity epidemic. \u2022 Hungary\u2019s largest opposition paper has halted publication after years of financial losses. Some say government interference played a role. \u2022 Keep your spending decisions separate from your saving decisions, advises our personal finance columnist. Don\u2019t believe that \u201cspending your own money saves you money in the long run. \u201d \u2022 Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. The euro fluctuated against the dollar overnight, and the pound gained. \u2022 The New Yorker: \u201cTurkey\u2019s   Coup. \u201d A comprehensive look at whether Fethullah Gulen, the exiled cleric, tried to topple the Turkish government in July. \u2022 Der Spiegel: \u201cRefugee Helps Germans Hunt ISIS. \u201d A Syrian journalist is helping the German authorities in their search for Islamic State supporters who came to Europe as refugees. \u2022 Bloomberg: \u201cMeet the Parents, Australia\u2019s   Housing Lender. \u201d More than half of   buyers in Australia get help from Mom and Dad. \u2022 A trend of people dressing up like clowns and scaring others has spread from the United States to Britain. \u2022 To hundreds of soccer players in England, Charles Porter is the person they call to make their life go a little smoother. \u201cWe live and die by our discretion,\u201d he said in his   interview. \u2022 \u201cL\u2019Odyss\u00e9e,\u201d a film on the life of the French ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, opens in French cinemas. \u2022 Vineyards in Piedmont, Italy, are encroaching on forests that are home to the white truffle. A new movement is trying to restore the region\u2019s woods to save the mushrooms. In October 1915, as World War I raged across Europe, London received reports of scores of people having been executed in   Belgium, and of hundreds being arrested. Some of the civilians who were killed had sheltered wounded British and French soldiers, whom they had smuggled to safety. Edith Cavell, a British nurse, helped Allied soldiers escape and was killed by the German Army for treason on this day 101 years ago. She was viewed as a hero and a symbol of Britain\u2019s war effort, and the news media called her \u201cour Joan of Arc. \u201d \u201cWhat poor psychologists the German officials are!\u201d one Dutch newspaper wrote about her execution. Allied forces put out recruitment posters calling for volunteers to \u201cavenge\u201d her death. A statue of Ms. Cavell stands near Trafalgar Square in London with an inscription that begins, \u201cPatriotism is not enough. \u201d Her dog, Jack, was embalmed and is on display at the Imperial War Museums. Stella Rimington, a former director general of the British intelligence service MI5, said in a BBC report that she narrated last year that there was  evidence that Ms. Cavell had spied for Britain. Secret messages were concealed in the clothes of soldiers the nurse helped return to Britain, Ms. Rimington said, adding, \u201cEspionage was still in its infancy. \u201d Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.
