Ergo, U.S. District Judge Anna Brown could not release them; instead she approved the U.S. Marshals\u2019 request to take them into custody. \\nWhen the marshals attempted that, however, a scuffle broke out between them and Ammon Bundy\u2019s lead attorney, Marcus Mumford: \\nAfter the verdicts were read, an attorney for group leader Ammon Bundy demanded his client be immediately released and repeatedly yelled at the judge. U.S. marshals tackled attorney Marcus Mumford to the ground, used a stun gun on him several times and arrested him. \\nMumford later explained to reporters what exactly had transpired: \\nAlso speaking with reporters, another one of Ammon\u2019s attorneys reportedly shared his belief that an acquittal would be achieved in the Nevada case as well. \\n\u201cWhen the jury here hears the whole story, I expect the same result,\u201d attorney Daniel Hill reportedly told the Associated Press, adding that he intended to ask for \u201cclient\u2019s release from federal custody pending trial in Nevada.\u201d \\nAccording to The Oregonian , the Bundy brothers\u2019 trial is set to begin Feb. 6, 2017. Their notorious father, Cliven Bundy, is slated to go on trial that day as well.'"}, "time": 1742562103.9271398}
