C.  \u2014   New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind ( ) has penned an open letter and accompanied it with a video titled, \u201cQuestions for Linda Sarsour from Assemblyman Hikind,\u201d asking the leftist Sharia advocate why she allegedly supports terrorism.[  \u201cYour support for terrorism on many different occasions,\u201d Hikind says in the video. \u201cThat\u2019s the question that all of us have that we don\u2019t understand. And, maybe, Linda you can respond to everyone so that we understand better. \u201d Sarsour, who was selected to deliver the keynote speech at CUNY\u2019s School of Public Health on June 1, has held controversial positions and associations in the past. \u201cI invite Linda Sarsour to publicly address these vital points about her past and her agenda,\u201d Hikind says. WATCH  RETWEET! Social justice activist or terrorist advocate? @lsarsour has some questions to answer. #ExposeSarsour pic. twitter.   \u2014   Dov Hikind (@HikindDov) May 1, 2017,  Hikind noted that Sarsour stood on a stage with convicted Palestinian terrorist Rasmea Odeh last month and said she was \u201chonored and privileged\u201d to do so. Odeh, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was convicted by an Israeli court for her role in the murder of Israeli students Leon Kanner and Eddie Joffe. Odeh is scheduled for deportation from the United States after she pled guilty to falsifying information on her U. S. immigration papers. \u201cThe actions of Rasmea Odeh who you praise, Linda Sarsour. You need to explain it,\u201d Hikind said. He then asked Sarsour to explain her reported glorification of rock throwing by Arab children at Israelis, calling it \u201cthe definition of courage. \u201d The definition of courage. #Palestine pic. twitter.   \u2014   Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) October 12, 2015,  \u201cYou think this is a courageous act to pick up rocks and throw them at cars?\u201d Hikind posited. He noted that those rocks have seriously injured people and killed people in cars. In 2013, a    girl died after the car she was in was attacked by rocks. Adele Biton was in a coma for two years before succumbing to her injuries and developing pneumonia. In a press release, Hikind noted, \u201cI hope everyone who admires Sarsour\u2019s association with the Women\u2019s movement \u2014  which I also support \u2014  will watch this brief but important video. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742628385.9187765}
