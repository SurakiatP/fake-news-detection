Viacom and its chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, fired back with everything they had on Saturday, attempting to discredit a sudden move by Mr. Redstone to change succession plans for his $40 billion media empire. Not only did Mr. Dauman and two Viacom directors raise questions related to Mr. Redstone\u2019s competency, but they also declared that Mr. Redstone had been manipulated and used by his daughter. The renewed scrutiny over Mr. Redstone\u2019s capacity came less than two weeks after a California judge dismissed a case on a similar issue without ruling on whether Mr. Redstone was mentally competent. It was sparked by an unexpected development on Friday, in a family and corporate tale that becomes messier by the week. Mr. Redstone ousted Mr. Dauman from the trust that will control his companies when he dies or is declared incompetent. He did so after expressing dissatisfaction with the performance of Viacom, according to a lawyer working on behalf of Mr. Redstone. Mr. Dauman was also removed from the board of National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which Mr. Redstone controls both Viacom and CBS. Also ousted from both positions was George Abrams, a   representative of Mr. Redstone, a Viacom director for 29 years and an ally of Mr. Dauman. The development set off a new round in a   battle pitting Mr. Dauman, Mr. Redstone\u2019s longtime confidant, against Shari Redstone, Mr. Redstone\u2019s once ostracized, recently reconciled daughter. Ms. Redstone has publicly opposed Mr. Dauman\u2019s leadership at Viacom, and his removal from the trust is a significant victory in her effort to shape the future of her father\u2019s companies. Ms. Redstone is vice chairman of Viacom and CBS and is one of seven members on the trust. But in biting language on Saturday, Viacom executives and directors joined forces to depict the ousting of Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams as a shameful attempt by Ms. Redstone to influence her father and gain control of his companies. They also portrayed Mr. Redstone as being in such failing health as to be unable to make such a decision. Carl Folta, a spokesman for Viacom, said in a statement that Mr. Redstone had been unduly influenced by his daughter \u201cto accomplish her   goal, which Mr. Redstone has always opposed, of gaining control of National Amusements and Viacom. \u201d Mr. Folta said the move to oust Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams was \u201ccompletely inconsistent with his long expressed wishes and intent, and extremely disruptive and damaging to Viacom and all of its shareholders. \u201d For his part, Mr. Abrams said, \u201cThe Sumner Redstone I knew would never have taken this action. \u201d And Frederic V. Salerno, Viacom\u2019s lead independent director, raised questions about Mr. Redstone\u2019s competence, saying the board decided last week to eliminate Mr. Redstone\u2019s compensation \u201cbased upon his recent complete lack of communication with the Viacom board and management team and his silence during recent board meetings, as well as recent public disclosures raising concerns about his health. \u201d In a statement on Saturday, Ms. Redstone said, \u201cI fully support my father\u2019s decisions and respect his authority to make them. \u201d Removing Mr. Dauman from the trust has raised the question of whether Mr. Redstone, or the trust after he dies, will move to oust Mr. Dauman as a director and as chief executive of Viacom. The company, the owner of the MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable networks and the Paramount Pictures film and television studios, has suffered a 40 percent decline in its stock price over the last year and has reported persistent weak results. \u201cIs Philippe Dauman dead man walking now?\u201d asked Richard Greenfield, a media analyst with BTIG Research. Referring to Mr. Redstone, he said, \u201cIf he is competent enough to change the trust, he is competent enough to use his voting power to change management. \u201d Whether Mr. Dauman will pursue legal action is not clear. During the public sparring on Saturday, two questions persisted. Did Mr. Redstone have the capacity to eject Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams from their positions? And to what extent was Ms. Redstone involved? Mr. Redstone, who has not been seen publicly since his 92nd birthday party last May, will turn 93 on Friday. While he continues to control Viacom and CBS, much about his condition has been shrouded in mystery beyond the fact that he has suffered minor strokes and has a severe speech impediment. The transcript of videotaped testimony presented during the trial showed a fiery, if somewhat feeble man who responded to some basic questions but could not answer others, such as his birth name. If Mr. Redstone lacked the capacity to make corporate decisions, as Mr. Dauman asserted, analysts said that would raise questions about whether Mr. Redstone\u2019s control should already have passed to the trust. Yet until Friday, neither Mr. Dauman nor Mr. Abrams, nor other directors of Viacom or CBS, publicly claimed that Mr. Redstone lacked mental capacity. In a declaration six months ago for the civil suit challenging Mr. Redstone\u2019s mental capacity, Mr. Dauman described his boss as \u201cengaged, attentive and as opinionated as ever. \u201d Mr. Redstone\u2019s lawyers, in a statement issued Friday, sought to use Mr. Dauman\u2019s own words against him. Citing his remarks, Michael C. Tu, a partner at the law firm Orrick, Herrington  Sutcliffe, said \u201cthat is exactly the Sumner Redstone who made these decisions. \u201d In his statement on behalf of Mr. Redstone, Mr. Tu said his client took \u201cdecisive and lawful action\u201d to remove Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams from their positions after he had \u201cexpressed his concerns regarding Viacom\u2019s performance to Messrs. Abrams and Dauman, both Viacom directors, and received no response from them. \u201d Mr. Folta of Viacom said that there had been no communication from Mr. Redstone and that the only contact came through \u201cwritten communication on Tuesday from Mr. Tu, a lawyer previously unknown until this week to anyone associated with Sumner other than Shari Redstone. \u201d Mr. Folta added that during a Viacom board meeting on Tuesday evening and all day Wednesday, \u201cnot a sound was heard from Sumner, who was connected by phone,\u201d and that Ms. Redstone, also connected by phone, \u201cdid not raise a single concern during the board session on any topic. \u201d Mr. Redstone engaged the new law firm after the suit challenging his capacity was dismissed on May 9. \u201cSumner had concerns related, as everybody knows, to the potential sale of Paramount and with respect to other corporate matters,\u201d said Robert N. Klieger, a partner of the law firm Hueston Hennigan who represented Mr. Redstone during the suit over his competency. \u201cI recommended to Sumner that he engage corporate counsel to represent him on those matters and helped facilitate getting Orrick on board to represent him. \u201d Mr. Folta and Mr. Salerno said that Ms. Redstone had denied Viacom directors access to her father. Dr. Brian Crowley, a psychiatrist in Washington who has frequently testified in civil and criminal trials at what he called the \u201cintersection of psychiatry and law,\u201d said there were two related issues in the situation: mental competency and \u201cundue influence. \u201d \u201cThere is no rigid definition of civil competence,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes he have the mental capacity to know what he\u2019s doing? Does he have the ability to exercise judgment and free will?\u201d While Mr. Redstone is a vulnerable person and may be subject to undue influence, not all influence is undue, Dr. Crowley said. \u201cHave they used their influence to in effect meet their own needs, rather than to help him make his own decision?\u201d he asked.'"}, "time": 1742564209.2641113}
