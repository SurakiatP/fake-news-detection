The decision to use the apartment as a museum was made in December 2015, and a small exhibition was held in the space in May. \\n\u201cSmall and very intimate, [the exhibition] was only put on for 10 days. We brought a first edition of The Master and Margarita and a few important bits of paraphernalia. It was an announcement of the future of this space as a museum,\u201d Peter Mansilla-Cruz, the director of the museum, told RBTH. \\nBulgakov lived in this apartment in the 1920s and 1930s and it is where he wrote his best-known work, The Master and Margarita . The novel recently was part of Google\u2019s online reading project. \\n\u201cThe house where Bulgakov lived and worked is a memorial to our cultural heritage,\u201d said Mansilla-Cruz, \u201cbehind its fa\u00e7ade is a 19 th century mansion, which was rebuilt and reconstructed from top to bottom in the Soviet period. The apartment was occupied by yard and district services, and by lifters at the Housing Department, so it is suitably well-worn. It has been redesigned inside \u2013 the arch which led into his famous office has been re-laid with brick.\u201d \\nBulgakov described the apartment in another of his works, Heart of a Dog . \\nFrom the exhibition \u201cManuscripts don\u2019t burn\u201d at Bolshaya Pirogovkaya St., 35A. Source: Moskva Agency \\nThe development of the museum\u2019s concept and the restoration will continue into 2017, but Mansilla-Cruz says that the place will become a memorial space furnished with Bulgakov\u2019s desk and other artifacts. \u201cLuckily, many of his photos from that time have been preserved, so all the details can be restored.\u201d \\nMoscow is already home to the State Bulgakov Museum. It is located near metro Mayakovskaya at 10 Bolshaya Sadovaya Street, the address at which Woland (Satan) and his entourage lived in The Master and Margarita . The museum organizes tours around Moscow featuring sites connected to Bulgakov. Related '"}, "time": 1742564100.4991355}
