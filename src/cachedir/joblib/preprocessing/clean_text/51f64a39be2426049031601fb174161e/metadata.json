USA!\u201d, Trump said he was \u201chumbled by this endorsement from true freedom fighters\u201d and recognized the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), a Cuban dissident organization composed of the wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters of political prisoners. \u201cThey march quietly to church every Sunday and\u2026 are subject to physical and verbal violence and abuse by government-sanctioned mobs,\u201d Trump noted, adding that Clinton \u201cturns a blind eye to the human rights violations that occur every single day.\u201d\\nMiami\u2019s Bay of Pigs Museum is a spiritual home for the Brigada 2506, the official name of the Cuban freedom fighters who embarked on the mission to overthrow Castro in 1961. It features a wall commemorating the martyrs killed during the operation \u2013 including a number of non-Cuban American fighters \u2013 as well as a variety of memorabilia from both the operation and Cuban history generally, including a collection of the flags used throughout the island\u2019s history.\\nBay of Pigs veterans have nearly unanimously asserted that the mission to free Cuba failed because leftist icon president John F. Kennedy failed to provide the air support the group had been promised after the fighters had deployed. Air support was critical to the design of the military operation.\\n\\nTrump\u2019s visit highlights the largely adversarial relationship Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have maintained with the Cuban exile community in the United States.\\nThe Clinton presidency is stained with the blood of dozens of Cubans seeking freedom. Among them are the 41 killed in July 1994, when the Cuban government sunk the \u201cMarch 13\u201d tugboat , seeking to arrive in the United States. Cuban government officials killed ten children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years in that operation; the Clinton White House did not issue a significant response to this act.\\nIn 1996, the Cuban government shot down two planes belonging to the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue in international waters, killing four Cuban-Americans, including U.S. citizens. Bill Clinton said of the attack , \u201cthis shooting of civilian aircraft out of the air was a flagrant violation of international law. It is wrong and the United States will not tolerate it.\u201d The Cuban government never faced trial for this violation, however, or significant repercussions for the act.\\nTowards the end of the Clinton tenure, in 2000, Clinton ordered the siege of a residential home in Miami, where Cuban exile child Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, 7 years old, was residing with his family. Gonz\u00e1lez was abducted from his home at gunpoint and returned to Cuba in an operation observers at the time described as \u201cresembl[ing] Munich 1940 more than Miami 2000.\u201d\\nGonz\u00e1lez, now an adult, is a prominent communist propaganda figure .\\nHillary Clinton herself has said that she supports President Barack Obama\u2019s concessions to the Castro regime announced on December 2014. While she was no longer his Secretary of State at the time, she took credit for his Cuba policies in her autobiography, Hard Choices . Since the Obama concession package, both violent arrests of dissidents and dangerous attempts to flee Cuba for the United States via the Caribbean Sea have skyrocketed.\\nA series of releases of emails from the organization Wikileaks shows that Clinton insiders, including campaign chairman John Podesta, are intimately acquainted with advocates for furthering business ties and emboldening the Castro regime, and that these advocates have influences Clinton\u2019s public statements on the issue.\\n  2016 Presidential Race , Hillary Clinton   Bay of Pigs , Cuba , Donald Trump , Hillary Clinton'"}, "time": 1742628545.5966353}
