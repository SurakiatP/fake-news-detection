No criminal charges were filed, but MF Global paid $132 million earlier this year in a civil settlement with MF Global customers.\\nTeneo\u2019s seemingly seedy behavior has long been a problem for the Clintons, and its alleged involvement in the MF Global scandal rippled across Clinton world. As revealed by an email chain published by Wikileaks, the Teneo-MF Global story was emailed to Chelsea Clinton the same days as publication, December 5, 2011.\\nResponding a day later , Chelsea told those in the email chain, which apparently included John Podesta, that this was not the first time Teneo had been a problem:\\nJohn, Bruce, Terry, Victoria, Jennifer \u2013 fyi re: below. I\u2019ve asked that it make my father\u2019s clips (it wld historically not as I understand it).\\nOn another note, I was in London Sunday and did a Foundation event Sunday evening and two people separately voiced concerns directly to me about Teneo , neither of whom I know well (one of whom is a friend of one of Marc\u2019s old colleagues, ie we know only tangentially) and Sara Latham (whom Victoria and Jennifer, I do know well \u2013 she worked for my Dad in the WH and lives in London) voiced serious concerns to Bari \u2013 including telling her Ilya has called Members of the House and Members of Parliament, \u201con behalf of President Clinton,\u201d for Teneo clients (eg for Andrew Liveris and Dow who\u2019s coming this month to London), without my father\u2019s knowledge and inelegantly and ineffectually at best and at worse has now precipitating people in London making comparisons between my father and Tony Blair\u2019s profit motivations. Which would horrify my father.\\nSara also told Bari she started working for Teneo, as Teneo, more than a year ago and then recently stopped because she was so upset, partly because of what Doug and Declan asked her to do/ pretend was happening for their clients at Davos- that\u2019s all I know. I am hoping to connect directly with Sara this week, if only to connect her belatedly into Victoria and Jennifer. I\u2019m speaking at an innovations in governance conference today here in Oxford and flying back later this afternoon. I will raise all of this and more with my father this evening. Wanted to update you all in the meanwhile about my augmented concerns post London and the below.\\n\u201cDoug and Declan\u201d are Doug Band and Declan Kelly, founding members of Teneo and longtime associates of the Clinton family.\\nChelsea Clinton is telling those on the thread in response to a press clip of the Human Events piece that she has been told by other people that Teneo is trading on her father\u2019s name for dubious purposes.\\nIn response to Chelsea\u2019s email, John Podesta emailed Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills saying \u201cWe need to move to a resolution of this quickly.\u201d\\nMills responded with a document that restructured Teneo, which Mills explained, \u201cessentially creates a full-time Personal office of the President headed by a new CEO/COS. That person \u2014 who is unaffiliated with any of the entities or Teneo \u2014 b/cs the decisionmaker on the allocation of the President\u2019s time and management and implementation of the President\u2019s desires with respect to each activity. Doug and Justin advise that person but do not make final decisions or have final implementation authority on any matters \u2013 which is consistent with what Doug has said he seeks \u2013 the ability to recommend but for others to be accountable for making the ultimate decisions.\u201d\\nWhile Chelsea was concerned with Teneo using Bill Clinton, other evidence demonstrates it was a two-way street. Teneo helped Bill Clinton make millions of dollars from speeches with corporations. They also helped raised large amounts of money for the Clinton Foundation and employed other associates of the Clintons.\\nLike most Clinton operations, it\u2019s never quite clear where the public service ends and the private gains begin.\\nThe post Clinton Network Concerned About Teneo\u2019s Consulting Behavior appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n'"}, "time": 1742628456.5383859}
