[It is an article of faith on the left that Russia wanted Trump to win the election because Vladimir Putin anticipated a more pliant approach, signaled by Trump\u2019s explicit desire to negotiate a better relationship. But the Russians may just as well have preferred Hillary Clinton, who had given Russia everything it wanted while serving as President Barack Obama\u2019s Secretary of State  \u2014   from the   \u201creset,\u201d to a surrender of U. S. missile defenses in Eastern Europe, to the sale of 20% of America\u2019s uranium reserves to a Russian company closely tied to the Russian state.  It is more plausible to suggest that Russia simply wants to disrupt American politics if it can get away with doing so, and would do the same regardless of which candidate won the election. Even if  \u2014   for argument\u2019s sake  \u2014   Putin once preferred Trump, that would not preclude him from trying to undermine President Trump now, if possible. And in the \u201c \u201d complex, Putin has found a particularly potent weapon, aimed directly at the president. One could not imagine a better way to create havoc for an adversary  \u2014   and the left is playing into the enemy\u2019s hands, eagerly and mindlessly, forgetting its own slavish enthusiasm for Russia for nearly a century. Holman Jenkins, writing in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday, notes that Putin found a unique vulnerability in the   of contemporary American politics, which makes devotees on either side more willing to believe the worst about the other. Partisans on both sides might share a conspiratorial mindset when relegated to opposition status, but only the Democrats can harness the alchemy of the mainstream media to \u201cnormalize\u201d fringe theories. Regardless, the flimsiness of the evidence against Trump is a clue. Jenkins notes that it was a dubious \u201cdossier\u201d that alleged that Russia had dirt on Trump that caused much of the initial suspicion last year  \u2014   and that it may well have been fed by Russian sources for that purpose. Add to that the recent revelation that FBI director James Comey suspected that a key email  \u2014   purportedly hacked by Russians, and which implicated Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a scheme to suppress any FBI investigation into Clinton  \u2014   was a fake, and a pattern seems to emerge. Moreover, many of the recent intelligence leaks that have attempted to tie Trump to Putin have been   at best  \u2014   in some cases, laughably so. The information that has been leaked could well have been fabricated  \u2014   or at least fed to unwitting U. S. Intelligence sources who were ready to believe, and convey, the worst. Sen. Lindsey Graham  \u2014   an early critic of Trump\u2019s Russia policy  \u2014   said as much on Sunday, when he speculated that an intercepted message from the Russian ambassador to his bosses back home, claiming that Jared Kushner wanted to set up a \u201cback channel,\u201d could well have been a   exposed on purpose to be intercepted by the U. S. Regardless, Trump is almost certainly right that the Russians are \u201claughing\u201d at us. The entire political and media establishment is utterly consumed by an obsession with Russian influence for which there is no actual evidence. It is a hysteria worse than that of the McCarthy years, because in those days there really were American communists trying to take over the U. S. government on Moscow\u2019s behalf. Thanks to the \u201c  complex,\u201d this may be the most powerful Russian disinformation campaign ever, and stands on the verge of bringing the American Republic to its knees. Journalists and elected Democrats are busily slapping each other on the back for \u201cstanding up for democracy. \u201d To the extent that they believe it  \u2014   when they are doing the opposite  \u2014   Russia is surely grateful.
