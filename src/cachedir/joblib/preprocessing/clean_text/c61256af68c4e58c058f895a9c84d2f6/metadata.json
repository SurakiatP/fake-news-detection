The issues discussed include Bill Clinton\u2019s past, Benghazi, the email server scandal and even alien life.\\nThe whistleblowing site has promised to release 50,000 messages from Podesta in the lead up to the US presidential election on November 8. A total of 34,197 communications have been released to date.\\nBill\u2019s past \\nBill Clinton\u2019s controversial past was evidently of concern to his wife\u2019s campaign team, which discussed how to handle questions on allegations of sexual assault against him.\\nPreparation for what the media might throw at her included the questions: \u201cWill you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?\u201d and \u201cHow is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did?\u201d \\nThe mail was sent by Ron Klain, a member of Clinton\u2019s debate preparation team, on January 12, 2016. Several days previous Paula Jones, one of Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers, gave an interview calling Hillary Clinton a \u201cliar\u201d and \u201ctwo-faced\u201d for trying to discredit her husband\u2019s accusers.\\nLet\u2019s hope the Democratic party is not suicidal \\nA July 2015 email from Clinton adviser Neera Tanden to Podesta discusses a CNN poll which she guesses will show, \u201cBernie doing pretty well w Hillary and doing as well against Jeb or close to it.\u201d \\n\u201cCan you imagine what Republicans would do with him if he were the nominee?\u201d Podesta replies, referring to Sanders.\\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what the poll actually says. Let\u2019s hope the Democratic party is not suicidal,\u201d Tanden says.\\n\u201cDo we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email?\u201d she asks. \u201cAnd has that person been drawn and quartered?\u201d \\n\u201cLike whole thing is f*cking insane,\u201d she adds.\\nAn October 2015 email chain between staffers discusses upcoming paid media ads about Benghazi and Clinton\u2019s email scandal.\\nThe group debates whether the ads should target Iowa and New Hampshire or be a national buy. \u201cI know the boss wants a national cable buy to reach the inside the beltway types, press and donors,\u201d Jennifer Palmieri says. \u201cBut press will hate this.\u201d \\nOren Shur replies, \u201cIf the objective is purely to undermine the Benghazi hearings, I think these spots will certainly help do that. But if the objective is to connect emails-Benghazi and conflate the two in voters\u2019 minds (which consultants feel is an imperative here), I\u2019m not sure we know whether we can credibly do that.\u201d \\nThe campaign appears to have decided to do a national ad on the subject.\\n\\nSmall tweaks A March 2016 email chain discussing Clinton\u2019s inaccurate statement about the late Nancy Reagan starting a national conversation about AIDS, when she did the opposite, reveals Clinton\u2019s unwillingness to admit mistakes, even when she is proven to be wrong.\\nThe subject of the meeting is described as \u201cthe difference between our contiguous universe nonviolent ETI and the celestials in our own universe.\u201d \\nThe team go back on forth on Clinton\u2019s statement about the issue. \u201cYESTERDAY I MADE A MISTAKE IN SPEAKING ABOUT NANCY REAGAN\u2019S record on HIV AND AIDS,\u201d it begins.\\n\u201cI think the chances of her OK-ing this statement with that top are slim,\u201d Megan Rooney says.\\n\u201cHere is a revised draft of a statement. It does include the words \u2018I made a mistake\u2019 in the first line,\u201d Rooney says. \u201cWe need a strategy for getting her to approve this. I don\u2019t know if that means someone who is traveling with her (Maya?) making the case\u2026 or something else.\u201d \\nA later draft was then sent, changing it to, \u201cI said something inaccurate when speaking about the Reagan\u2019s\u2019 record on HIV and AIDS.\u201d \\n\u201cThe Secretary approved the statement, with small tweaks,\u201d Rooney says.\\nExtraterrestrial disclosure \\nFormer astronaut Edgar Mitchell, known for his correspondence with Podesta regarding extraterrestrials, emails Podesta regarding the \u201cPhoenix Lights\u201d incident in 1997, in which thousands of people reported sightings of hovering lights in the sky.\\nMitchell \u201cwas on the phone just as they were happening over Phoenix with an eyewitness describing on March 13, 1997. This incentives about disclosure, while other reports like Roswell disincentives,\u201d according to the mail from April 2015.\\nThe subject of extraterrestrial disclosure is \u201cnow more important than ever\u201d according to another mail sent on Mitchell\u2019s behalf a month later.\\n\u201cIt is also imperative that after your talk with Edgar, he then speak directly with President Obama via Skype for historical purposes, about the same issue, while the President is still in office,\u201d Podesta is told.
