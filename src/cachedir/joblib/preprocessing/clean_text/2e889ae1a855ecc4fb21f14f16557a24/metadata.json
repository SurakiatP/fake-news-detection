Mr. Trump used the first roughly 10 minutes of his remarks to energy executives at a shale industry conference here to address the current unrest  \u2014   including in Charlotte, N. C. after an   man was fatally shot by the police  \u2014   before turning more broadly to the plight of the nation\u2019s largely black urban areas. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you\u2019re watching on television at night,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Some interpreted the Republican nominee\u2019s remarks as specifically addressing the violent demonstrations in Charlotte, or at least the protests that have sprung up around the country this year in response to police shootings. But Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said he was not referring to Charlotte or the broader protest movement, which is often led by  . \u201cHe wasn\u2019t talking about Charlotte specifically,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cAs he has done in many different venues on many different occasions, he is addressing a major concern that authorities and moms all across the country are raising with him, which is indiscriminate drug use and opiate addiction. \u201d Before turning to the topic at hand  \u2014   energy  \u2014   Mr. Trump said he first wanted to address \u201cthe turmoil unfolding right now in our country. \u201d \u201cWe have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,\u201d he said. \u201cMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. \u201d He also worried aloud whether the protests and unrest had diminished the nation\u2019s international standing. \u201cOur country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world\u2019s leader  \u2014   how can we lead when we can\u2019t even control our own cities?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe honor and recognize the right for all Americans to peacefully assemble and protest and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others. \u201d Earlier, in an interview on \u201cFox  Friends,\u201d Mr. Trump addressed his call on Wednesday to broaden the use of    policing to other cities across the nation. Asked about the policy, which is loathed by many   and whose legality has been questioned, Mr. Trump said he was specifically referring to the use of increased    in Chicago  \u2014   a city that has been besieged by crime and gun violence. But he also asserted his general support for the policy  \u2014   \u201dThey\u2019ll stop, they\u2019ll frisk, and they\u2019ll take the gun away, and they won\u2019t have anything to shoot with,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Fox  \u2014   and he reiterated that support during his speech here on Thursday. \u201cLook at the example we had in New York of Mayor Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Mr. Trump said, saying that the    policies, which were instituted during Mr. Giuliani\u2019s tenure as mayor, had helped curb murder and other crimes in the city. \u201cThink of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable. \u201d But Mr. Trump, whose support among   voters is still in the single digits in most polls, also tried to strike a more inclusive, conciliatory note, speaking of the \u201c    residents who live in these communities\u201d and \u201csuffer the most as a result of these riots. \u201d He called for more law enforcement, more community engagement and \u201cmore effective policing. \u201d \u201cOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the   parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations,\u201d he said. \u201cFor every one violent protester, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep  \u2014   really to sleep safely at night. To be able to walk on the streets. To be able to go to the grocery store. \u201d Later, Mr. Trump stopped by Geno\u2019s, the famous Philadelphia cheesesteak place, to sample the city\u2019s signature sandwich. Turning to the assembled cameras and reporters, Mr. Trump repeatedly pressed, \u201cWho wants one?\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m going to get one for Hillary,\u201d he joked. A man in the crowd shouted back: \u201cThen she\u2019ll choke on it!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563680.4594047}
