[Her chief rival in the race for the French presidency, centrist Emmanuel Macron, pointedly waved an EU flag from the podium at a campaign rally the next day.  Love it or loathe it, the European Union has become a   issue in the election, fanning fears far beyond France in the wake of Britain\u2019s Brexit vote that a \u201cFrexit\u201d could doom the    bloc. \u201cRarely has the European issue held such a   place on all the candidates\u2019 platforms as in this electoral campaign,\u201d said analyst Pierre Vimont of the Carnegie Europe think tank. In the five years since France\u2019s last presidential vote, Europe has seen a massive migrant crisis and a rise in populism, both contributing to the Brexit vote. None of the four main French candidates can afford to be neutral on the EU, whether they portray it as the source of all woes or a guarantee of peace and stability. Like Macron, conservative candidate Francois Fillon is bullish on Brussels, highlighting the   leadership axis and defending the euro. Both candidates met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during the campaign. Arrayed on the other side are Le Pen, who advocates leaving the EU immediately, and   candidate   Melenchon, who demands a renegotiation of key treaty provisions. \u201cPositions have hardened,\u201d said Manuel Lafont Rapnouil of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cMelenchon was very influenced by what happened to (Greek   party) Syriza,\u201d which gave in to European demands after months of crisis. Syriza, the party of Greek premier Alexis Tsipras, endorsed Melenchon, saying he \u201crepresents hope for change for France and Europe\u201d. Le Pen, on the other hand, \u201cis riding the wave of Brexit\u201d and Donald Trump\u2019s surprise accession to the White House, he said. The ideological underpinnings of the two candidates\u2019 eurosceptism are worlds apart, however.  \u2014   \u2018Dictatorship of banks\u2019  \u2014   Le Pen stresses economic, monetary and territorial \u201csovereignty\u201d along with a \u201cnational preference\u201d for French citizens in the workplace and the allocation of state benefits. Melenchon vows to end the \u201cnightmare\u201d of an EU that submits its members to \u201cthe dictatorship of the banks\u201d and the austerity policies they impose. But both promise a showdown with Brussels and say they are certain to come out on top given the strength of France within the bloc. Le Pen says she will launch six months of talks aimed at withdrawing France from the   Schengen area, as well as from the euro, before calling a referendum on whether the French want to leave the EU  \u2014   a   \u201cFrexit\u201d. For his part, Melenchon has a   approach summed up as \u201cchange the EU or leave it\u201d: a Plan A by which France will renegotiate its membership terms and a Plan B for a unilateral Frexit. As for the single currency, a poll carried out in early March found that more than 70 percent of the French oppose quitting the eurozone. On the eve of Sunday\u2019s first round, Melenchon has toned down his euroscepticism, saying that he would prefer for France to stay in the EU and the eurozone. Le Pen has also adjusted her rhetoric, focusing more on FN staple issues such as immigration and security  \u2014   the latter question surging to the fore after Thursday\u2019s jihadist killing of a policeman in the Champs Elysees. On the   side, Macron says he has \u201cEurope at heart\u201d wants to bolster the eurozone and is the only candidate who favours CETA, the   agreement between the EU and Canada that will provisionally come into force in a few weeks. Fillon, more protective of French sovereignty, wants a   of the balance of power between Brussels and EU members states.   Giuliani of the Robert Schuman Foundation said both Fillon and Macron are too complacent with the status quo, calling the EU planks of their platforms \u201cunimaginative\u201d. Candidates should talk about the EU\u2019s renewal and how France needs to revitalise its role within it, Giuliani said.'"}, "time": 1742562408.7089217}
