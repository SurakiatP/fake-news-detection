[He also revealed the investigation found thousands of Clinton\u2019s emails on the seized laptop of Anthony Weiner, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin\u2019s husband, including classified emails.  Comey said it made him \u201cmildly nauseous\u201d to think he could have had some impact on the election, but that he believes he did the right thing and to this day, would not change his mind. \u201cIt makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election. But honestly, it wouldn\u2019t change the decision,\u201d he told the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing. He explained that investigators found metadata on Weiner\u2019s laptop that showed there were thousands of Clinton\u2019s emails on the device, and that they believed the emails could include those missing from her first three months as secretary of state. Comey said after repeatedly telling members of Congress that the FBI had concluded its investigation into Clinton, the only right thing to do was to let Congress know the case was reopened. \u201cI could see two doors and they were both actions. One was labeled \u2018speak,\u2019 the other was labeled \u2018conceal,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHaving repeatedly told this Congress, we are done and there\u2019s nothing there, there\u2019s no case there, there\u2019s no case there, to restart in a hugely significant way, potentially finding the   that would reflect on her intent from the beginning and not speak about it would require an active concealment, in my view,\u201d he said. He said \u201cspeak would be really bad,\u201d but \u201cconcealing in my view would be catastrophic. \u201d He said he was asked by a junior lawyer whether he thought his decision would help   Donald Trump, but said he did not \u201cfor a moment. \u201d \u201cNot for a moment because down that path lies the death of the FBI as an independent institution in America. I can\u2019t consider for a second whose political fortunes will be affected in what way,\u201d he said. Comey said the investigation into Weiner\u2019s laptop showed that Abedin had regularly forwarded emails to her husband, likely for him to print out for her. He said Abedin forwarded \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of emails to Weiner, 40, 000 of which they reviewed. Three thousand of those were   and 12 of them contained classified information, he said. But he said Abedin and Weiner were not charged with any wrongdoing since investigators did not find a general sense of criminal intent  \u2014   a decision that Sens. Lindsey Graham ( ) and Ted Cruz ( ) scoffed at. \u201cOn its face, anyone dealing with classified information should know that that conduct is impermissible,\u201d Cruz said. Graham said someone should be prosecuted for allowing Weiner to have access to classified information. Weiner is a former New York congressman who resigned after he was caught sending a sexually explicit photo of himself to a woman. He later was involved in several more similar scandals, and after an article claimed he had engaged in \u201csexting\u201d with a    girl, investigators seized his laptop. Despite Comey\u2019s impassioned defense of why he announced the investigation, Democrats on the committee continued to criticize him. The FBI director has come under fire from Democrats since Clinton\u2019s loss in November to Trump. Clinton herself on Tuesday said she was \u201con the way to winning\u201d until Comey\u2019s announcement. \u201cI was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey\u2019s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but were scared off,\u201d she said at an international women\u2019s conference. \u201cIf the election were on October 27, I\u2019d be your president,\u201d she added. Sen. John Cornyn ( ) during the hearing apologized to Comey for Clinton\u2019s remarks, and said she was blaming \u201ceveryone but herself. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562630.6258776}
