RAIN OR SHINE,\u201d organizers wrote. The march is scheduled to coincide with the arrival of attendees to the Super Bowl. Attendees have been encouraged to use public transportation. Some of the seating capacity of these buses and trains could be taken up by protesters in an attempt to slow down the attendees\u2019 arrival to the NRG Stadium. The protest is expected to end before game time. A massive security operation is underway in advance of Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl LI presentation. Additional resources have been brought in from local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. U. S. Customs and Border Protection is adding resources to the effort to maintain safety at the event. The agency tasked with securing our nation\u2019s borders and ports of entry is providing aviation and electronic resources in addition to manpower. \u201cLOOK @CustomsBorder working with many partners @HoustonTX to ensure safe #SB51 #SEESOMETHINGSAYSOMETHING,\u201d the agency tweeted on Saturday.
