Donna Edwards ( ).  During the discussion, Santelli accused Todd of \u201cpicking sides\u201d and dismissed Mitchell\u2019s defense of the attention given to the Russian hacking controversy by the media. Partial transcript as follows: DAVID BROOKS: Putin is a guy who murders journalists, who has destroyed the democratic process in his own country and now suddenly he feels the freedom to try to do that in our country. It\u2019s not normal statecraft. (CROSSTALK) RICK SANTELLI: To see Russians happy because Trump won  \u2014   on election night, I never saw you so unhappy. You pick sides. Everybody picks sides. ANDREA MITCHELL: That\u2019s not true, Rick. CHUCK TODD: Who picks sides? MITCHSLL: That\u2019s just not true. Let\u2019s get back to the facts here. SANTELLI: What are the facts? We were hacking [Angela] Merkel\u2019s phone. Everybody does it. MITCHELL: Rick, here\u2019s the difference. We do it, they do it. What made this different is that the Russians weaponized it by transferring it through intermediaries to WikiLeaks. They dumped it out. We do it and hold it. They do it and hold it. (CROSSTALK) MITCHELL: Let me finish my sentence  \u2014   WikiLeaks was out from the end of the summer and it was being investigated. SANTELLI: So where were these headlines then? (CROSSTALK) MITCHELL: There was plenty of headlines. There was no proof of who did it. SANTELLI: People in charge of intelligence are political as well. DONNA EDWARDS: What happened here is the intelligence gathering that normally takes place was operationalized by the Russians to interfere with our elections. If you look at the report  \u2014   MITCHELL: They did it in Ukraine. They\u2019re doing it in Germany. EDWARDS: They\u2019re doing it in Germany right now and this is really serious. We\u2019re not going to get over by just saying everybody does it. SANTELLI: Right, we should be solving the problem instead of making it a political hot potato. Let me see the Cuban missiles on the island picture. Trump needs to see it before networks need to see it. MITCHELL: I went to the hearing  \u2014   SANTELLI: Oh the hearing. There\u2019s hearings on everything. They\u2019re kabuki theater. MITCHELL: Well Rick, if you had been there you would have seen something very different.
