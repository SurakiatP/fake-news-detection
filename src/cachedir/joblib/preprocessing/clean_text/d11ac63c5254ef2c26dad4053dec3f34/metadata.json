The U. S. State Department issued its remarks on the matter on Thursday, warning against the referendum taking place before the ultimate defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq. A coalition including Kurdish Peshmerga forces,   Iraqi Shiite militias, and the Iraqi military are currently fighting to eradicate the Islamic State completely from its final major stronghold in the country of Mosul. \u201cWe support a unified, stable and a federal Iraq. We appreciate and understand the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Iraqi Kurdistan,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. \u201cWe   \u2026     encourage the regional authorities to engage with the government of Iraq on the full range of important issues, including the future of relations between Baghdad and Erbil, on the bases of the Iraqi constitution. \u201d Nauert added concern that the referendum could damage efforts to address \u201cmore urgent priorities\u201d than a free Kurdistan, including the fight against the Islamic State. American officials have long expressed a belief that Kurdistan would become an independent state in the near future, however. \u201cKurdish independence is on a trajectory where it is probably not if, but when,\u201d Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, the head of Pentagon intelligence, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month. \u201cAnd it will complicate the situation unless there\u2019s an agreement in Baghdad \u2014  an agreement that all of the parties can live with. \u201d The KRG, based in Erbil, cooperates with the United States on   activities and maintains friendly relations with neighbors like Turkey, currently embroiled in a regional conflict with two other Kurdish entities, the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK). The KRG has repeatedly demanded that both the YPG and PKK stay out of KRG territory. The Turkish government has, nonetheless, loudly opposed the KRG independence referendum, with officials calling the vote a \u201cgrave mistake. \u201d Prime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m personally referred to the vote as \u201cirresponsible. \u201d The Kurdish outlet Rudaw quotes a Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) member saying that Turkish officials also privately \u201cthreatened\u201d Iraqi Kurds who sought to organize the referendum. Barzani announced through a Twitter statement on Wednesday that the referendum would take place on September 25. The presidential office also released an official announcement confirming that the KRG leadership had \u201cdecided that the date for the independence referendum shall be Monday, September 25, 2017. It will be on that day when the people of the Kurdistan Region, as well as those living in the disputed areas, will cast their votes on whether they accept independence for the Kurdistan. \u201d The announcement triggered mass exclamations of support from Kurds on social media, according to Kurdistan24, which notes that \u201cKurds are believed to be the largest stateless nation in the world, estimated to be over 40 million. \u201d Many added the Kurdish flag to their profile photos and expressed support for Barzani. Opinion polls among Kurds also corroborate the strong support for independence that appeared online. We crossed the Rubicon with that decision, there is no going back,\u201d KRG senior adviser Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters Thursday. \u201cA referendum is a democratic process, no democratic country can oppose having a referendum we are not talking about independence, we are talking about the referendum. \u201d The Kurdish outlet BasNews reports that   Arab Iraqis also appear supportive of the move, with a Turkmen political leader expressing support for the \u201csignificant\u201d measure, and a Yazidi leader stating, \u201cKurdish Yezidis support referendum and independence of Kurdistan Region. \u201d Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742562300.0970984}
