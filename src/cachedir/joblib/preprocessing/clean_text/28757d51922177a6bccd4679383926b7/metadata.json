The room full of Second Amendment fanatics panicked when one of Trump\u2019s fans yelled \u201cgun!\u201d and Trump was rushed from the stage. Immediately, Trump\u2019s campaign began spinning the lie that this man had intended to assassinate Trump. \\nIn fact, all he was armed with was a poster saying \u201cRepublicans Against Trump.\u201d The whole incident was over nothing. But it didn\u2019t stop Trump\u2019s fans from pretending this proved Trump was a profile in courage. His campaign\u2019s social media director retweeted a (false) message that Trump was back on stage after an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d\u2013 like he was Teddy goddamn Roosevelt, speaking with a bullet in his chest .

He returned to the stage precisely because there was no threat . Mere minutes after agents tackled the \u201cassassin\u201d they realized the guy was a harmless protester carrying a poster and had no weapons. He was released shortly afterwards. \\nMeanwhile, there is an example of a candidate staring down a scary situation and not blinking. It\u2019s Hillary Clinton. \\nUnlike the poster-carrying Republican, a protester in Iowa once rushed Clinton\u2019s stage and actually almost got within arm\u2019s reach of her. She took a quick glance as her Secret Service detail tackled the protester\u2026 and kept talking. Protester tries to storm the stage as Clinton speaks in Iowa.

And she \u2013 again \u2013 just stared the person down. \\nSo let\u2019s hear Trump\u2019s followers call Hillary Clinton brave for doing what Trump did not. We\u2019ll wait. \\nFeatured image via CNN'"}, "time": 1742563810.6776745}
