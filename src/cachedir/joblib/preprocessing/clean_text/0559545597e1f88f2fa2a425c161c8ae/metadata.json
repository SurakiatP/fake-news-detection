The ballroom, a forbiddingly cavernous space, can be a comedy slaughterhouse. Bombing there means hearing a sad symphony of the HVAC system and clinking silverware, or maybe seeing Henry Kissinger nodding off at Table 27. (I saw it happen during Rich Little\u2019s set in 2007, in the middle of Mr. Little\u2019s Nixon impersonation no less.) But the   gig can also give a topical comedian like Mr. Wilmore a chance to stitch his name into the   fabric of America, before an audience that includes the president and some 2, 700 powerful people in government, media, politics and show business. \u201cStephen\u2019s was the bravest,\u201d Mr. Wilmore told me as he looked out from the stage at the ballroom. He was referring to the seminal performance that Stephen Colbert gave in 2006. Playing his   Comedy Central character, an egotistic conservative talk show host, Mr. Colbert mockingly defended the Iraq war and the Washington press corps\u2019 coverage of it. The act, typical of his show, wilted inside the hall. But it was a hit out in the world because it tapped the growing perception that a   relationship between journalists and government officials produced credulous reporting that helped start a war under false pretenses. It was the perfect pairing of a comedian and the moment. Mr. Wilmore, whose \u201cNightly Show\u201d occupies Mr. Colbert\u2019s old 11:30 time slot on Comedy Central, knew he was part of a similar pairing, \u201cone of those accidents of timing,\u201d he said. Yes, he was a leading black comedian performing at the last correspondents\u2019 dinner for the nation\u2019s first black president. But his appearance was also coming during a national conversation about race and law enforcement race and the news media  \u2014   including at The New York Times  \u2014   and race and economic injustice. Mr. Wilmore has branded this year\u2019s political campaign \u201cThe  \u201d of the White House. And now here he was, getting ready to address an overwhelmingly white crowd of reporters  \u2014   a sign of how far journalism has to go in achieving meaningful diversity  \u2014   in the middle of a party weekend that can give official Washington the same sense of remove that the decadent capital city has in the \u201cHunger Games\u201d movies. I asked him if there would be any \u201cWhite House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner So White\u201d jokes. No, he said. He hinted at an inner tension between going for a big political statement and going for laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s why I say Stephen did the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever seen, you know?\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause you want to go and have a good time, get laughs and have everybody say, \u2018Yeah, you killed. \u2019\u201d Before the dinner, Mr. Wilmore\u2019s hotel suite was a show business version of a groom\u2019s room before a wedding. Pacing around the living area were his manager his agent his publicist one of his writers, Robin Thede friends like Kenya Barris, who created the TV sitcom \u201c \u201d and his parents, Betty and Larry Wilmore. The whole group was to meet the president and first lady before heading into the hall. Mr. Wilmore was in his tuxedo  \u2014   he is a necktie man, not a bow tie man  \u2014   and staying quiet, getting into the zone. \u201cI\u2019ve always been proud of him,\u201d Betty Wilmore told me as we all headed to the elevator. Mr. Wilmore seemed to cringe a little  \u2014   as a son would  \u2014   when she remembered showing up as the sole cheering section for his high school basketball team in California. \u201cWhy do I have to remember this?\u201d Mr. Wilmore said. Mr. Wilmore said he was ready, but he and his producer had one fear: that President Obama, who would go first, would step on Mr. Wilmore\u2019s act. That\u2019s what he did to Seth Meyers at the 2011 dinner, by releasing his birth certificate that afternoon (\u201cThanks for the timing on that,\u201d Mr. Meyers had said then, holding up pages of birth certificate jokes.) But Mr. Obama\u2019s typically commanding performance on Saturday left Mr. Wilmore\u2019s jokes more or less unscathed. And Mr. Wilmore came forward with a routine that gave his audience some uncomfortable moments that clearly came through on   (which is how I watched it because The New York Times stopped going to the dinner starting in 2008). Calling the dinner \u201cNegro night,\u201d Mr. Wilmore said Fox News would cover the speech from him and Mr. Obama as \u201cTwo thugs disrupt elegant dinner in D. C. \u201d He joked that MSNBC now stood for \u201cMissing a Significant Number of Black Correspondents,\u201d a reference to its cancellation of a show hosted by Melissa  . \u201cSome of our finest black journalists are here tonight,\u201d he said, and then added, \u201cDon Lemon is here too,\u201d a reference to the black journalist on CNN. (Mr. Lemon responded with a   salute.) His high notes included telling the president to butt out of comedy, seeing as how Mr. Wilmore doesn\u2019t go around \u201csigning executive orders, pardoning turkeys, not closing Guant\u00e1namo. \u201d But sometimes the crowd groaned or fell silent, prompting him at one point to say, \u201cYou guys are tough, man. \u201d But at the end he got serious, speaking about how proud he was that Mr. Obama had proved \u201ca black man can lead the entire free world,\u201d and ended by saying \u201cYo, Barry, you did it,\u201d and referring to Mr. Obama with an affectionate twist on the  . They embraced. As Mr. Wilmore made his way through a light rain to the Vanity Fair and Bloomberg News   at the French ambassador\u2019s residence  \u2014   where Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. mingled with stars like the actresses Helen Mirren and Rachel McAdams  \u2014   the reviews started trickling in. Brian Lowry\u2019s synopsis on CNN Money carried the headline \u201cLarry Wilmore gets groans and grimaces. \u201d \u201cWilmore Underwhelms,\u201d The Hollywood Reporter reported. But then the counternarrative emerged, suggesting that his routine played better outside the bubble. A Daily Beast review likened his act to Mr. Colbert\u2019s, and The Drudge Report gave him a screaming headline: \u201cComedian Eats the Press!\u201d Leaning against a doorjamb at the party, Mr. Wilmore told me the whole experience was \u201csurreal. \u201d The motto of his show is \u201cKeep it 100,\u201d as in keep it real, and, he said, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to keep it 100, I gotta do the jokes. \u201d Reality can be in short supply every year during this weekend. The Correspondents\u2019 Association deserves credit for having a comic like Mr. Wilmore at its dinner. And regardless of whether you liked Mr. Wilmore\u2019s act, you can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t keep it 100. Bad things happen in Washington when people don\u2019t.'"}, "time": 1742561883.228704}
