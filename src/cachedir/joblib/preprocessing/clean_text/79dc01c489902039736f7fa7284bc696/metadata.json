Surely the polls she tracked anxiously were not to be trusted, she said. Surely Donald J. Trump, the man with the garish golden tower across town, would not be allowed to reach the White House. \u201cWe have to have more faith in the American public,\u201d said Ms. Donohue, 61, a longtime New Yorker now living in Seattle. A man behind her could not suppress a loud snort. Then Cathi Anderson, who was shopping with Ms. Donohue, mentioned yet another distressing poll, this one from Ohio, which showed Mr. Trump ahead. Ms. Donohue nodded grimly. Just in case her faith in the American electorate was misplaced, Ms. Donohue said, she had retained her Irish citizenship. For both parties, every election can feel like the most vital of a lifetime, the one day standing between a   nation and its imminent demise. Among liberals, there is an especially rich tradition of \u201c\u201d as even some practitioners call it, at the faintest sign of shakiness from their candidate. But as Hillary Clinton lurches toward Election Day, her supporters at times seem overwhelmed by a tsunami of unease, exacerbated by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s bout of pneumonia and a   acknowledgment of the illness. They are confronting a question they had assumed, just a few weeks ago, they would not need to consider in a race against the most unpopular presidential nominee in modern times: Could Mrs. Clinton actually blow this? \u201cIt\u2019s like someone dropped ice water on the head of America,\u201d Julie Gaines, the owner of Fishs Eddy, a home goods store in Manhattan, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s increased odds. \u201cEveryone sobered up. This could happen. \u201d The creeping dread has accelerated in recent days, reaching critical levels even by Democratic standards. Mrs. Clinton became sick. Several polls tightened to the margin of panic, with Mr. Trump overtaking her in surveys in Ohio and Florida. And even as Democrats hoped on Friday that Mr. Trump\u2019s latest gambit  \u2014   seeking to distance himself from his long history of \u201cbirtherism\u201d  \u2014   would backfire, there is a fear that no scandal can sink him. A cartoon in The New Yorker captured it best: A woman sits in her psychiatrist\u2019s office, perspiring in distress. The doctor scribbles on a pad. \u201cI\u2019m giving you something for Hillary\u2019s pneumonia,\u201d the caption reads. Supporters of Mrs. Clinton have greeted the moment with varying degrees of alarm, according to interviews with dozens of them across the country. They read warily about the health of her lungs and her   field operations. They reassure one another by reminding themselves of President Obama\u2019s two winning campaigns, which encountered similar fits of concern after Labor Day. But even some zealous Clinton defenders have grown frustrated with their candidate, marveling at the prospect of her snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, for which some say they would never forgive her. The campaign\u2019s decision last week not to acknowledge Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pneumonia until two days after a diagnosis, once video surfaced of her stumbling out of a Sept. 11 memorial service on Sunday, has especially rankled. \u201cThey kept it from us,\u201d said Sonia Ascher, 74, a former campaign volunteer, sitting with her husband and son at a coffee shop in Portsmouth, N. H. \u201cIt was just another thing again, another mistake, which she really can\u2019t afford right now. \u201d The gloom seems to be spreading. Maurice Doucet, 55, a software engineer from Portland, Ore. wondered aloud on Wednesday how the race had gotten this close, lamenting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state. \u201cThe rational side of my brain goes, \u2018There\u2019s no way people are actually going to switch sides,\u2019\u201d he said of voters\u2019 movement toward Mr. Trump. \u201cBut the emotional side,\u201d he added, his voice trailing off moments later. In Washington Square Park in Manhattan, among smitten college students and acoustic guitars, Guillermo Vidal, 75, grimaced at the thought of a Trump presidency. His friend\u2019s bichon   mix, Dipsy, sat on the bench beside him, looking fretful. Mr. Vidal was asked what was troubling Dipsy. \u201cShe\u2019s a Democrat,\u201d Mr. Vidal said dryly. Then there are those who traffic in angst professionally, who are straining to consider even the chance of a Trump election. \u201cThe possibility of that is too horrifying to broach,\u201d Larry David, the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d   and \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d star, wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s like contemplating your own death. \u201d Surely Mr. David had done that, too? \u201cI can\u2019t go there,\u201d he said. In liberal enclaves, some modest contingency planning has begun. Threats of relocation are a bipartisan ritual every four years, expanding the audience for Canadian home listings. But this time, voters seem to be taking their research a bit more seriously. Ramona Gant, 28, a graduate student in Chicago, said she had just renewed her passport with the election in mind. Ms. Donohue\u2019s friend at Zabar\u2019s, Ms. Anderson, also of Seattle, mused that Vancouver was not too far up the road. Mike Brennan, 67, from Ventura County, Calif. is keeping an eye on the stock market. \u201cIf it looks like it\u2019s going to be close,\u201d said Mr. Brennan, a Republican supporting Mrs. Clinton, \u201cI\u2019ll pull my money out. \u201d For many Americans, Mr. Trump\u2019s momentum has registered as a more visceral threat, heightening concerns that had festered since his candidacy began. Ahtziry Barrera, 18, a college freshman from Orlando, Fla. arrived in the United States more than a decade ago from Mexico. Under an Obama administration policy known as DACA, which Mrs. Clinton has vowed to protect, Ms. Barrera has been allowed to stay in the country because she entered as a child. \u201cA lot of people were not taking him seriously. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s not going to win.\u2019 But it happened,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump\u2019s success in the Republican primary race. \u201cIt is a big stress on me, knowing that Nov. 8 is the day I\u2019ll know whether my future is going to be secure or not. \u201d Some optimists have preached calm, reminding one another of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s organizational advantages and holding out hope that she can best Mr. Trump decisively on a debate stage. While allowing that Mrs. Clinton has not run a perfect race, many of her admirers have cast blame elsewhere, singling out the news media, the Republicans who nominated Mr. Trump and, of course, the man himself. Gloria Steinem, the feminist leader and a Clinton supporter, said in an email that she had sensed a growing worry in recent weeks, fearing that Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy was becoming \u201clegitimized by \u2018media evenhandedness\u2019\u201d that had made his assorted scandals seem more banal. \u201cThere are things any campaign could do better, but in this case, I fear it\u2019s like blaming the victim instead of the bully  \u2014   dissociating in the hope that we won\u2019t be bullied, too,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018If only she hadn\u2019t been walking in that neighborhood.   \u2026    \u2019\u201d Others hold tight to an abiding belief, perhaps against their better judgment, that everything will work out. \u201cI still believe in humanity,\u201d said Nadia Johnson, 22, a Brooklyn resident lunching at a Whole Foods this week. She quickly added a request: Ask her again in November.'"}, "time": 1742563275.5598614}
