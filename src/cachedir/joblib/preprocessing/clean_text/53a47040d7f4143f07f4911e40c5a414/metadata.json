It was an annual agony waiting to see if the victim would forget his lines \u2014in which case he would be prompted in a stage whisper by the Headmaster on the dais behind him\u2014but agonizing suspense is not the main reason I think of that scene this Election Day. Whatever happens, it\u2019s time to say: let us now praise famous Trumps. \\nElection Day suspense may be agonizing, but one thing at least is certain: The next President is not going to be Jeb Bush. Or Marco Rubio. Or even the tragically-misguided Rand Paul. \\nYet at one point it appeared absolutely certain that Bush or Rubio would get the GOP nomination. (And it\u2019s not at all clear they could have done better in the general election: for example, WikiLeaks has revealed that the Clinton campaign had even bigger opposition research files on Rubio than it did on Trump\u2013 Presidential Horse Race 2016: Wikileaks proves Trump was the best Republican to run against Hillary , by Jeffrey A. Rendall , Conservative HQ, October 26, 2016.) \\nTrump single-handedly destroyed every Establishment candidate. He thus gave America at least another chance to avoid the Amnesty/ Immigration Surge that the GOP elite, in combination with the rest of the Ruling Class, has been conspiring to unleash for more than fifteen years. \\nIndeed, by exposing to the Republican base their own party Establishment\u2019s selfishness, spite, and sheer treachery in the face of the very real threat of a third Obama term, Trump may have finally rescued his country from the apparently endless Blight of Bush \u2014to say nothing of the horrible prospect of a Curse of Kasich. \\nDonald J. Trump is infinitely better than all previous GOP nominees on VDARE.com\u2019s key issue of immigration, in the sense that one is infinitely more than zero (I think that\u2019s right\u2014have to check the details with John Derbyshire ). Nevertheless, Trump has frequently driven us crazy by forgetting to use the issue, not exploiting it enough , not remembering the details , not exploring build-outs like the deeply unpopular birthright citizenship, the need for Official English , etc. etc. \\nBut all of that fades in the face of of his extraordinary unflinching will\u2013in defiance of literally the entire world, including an illegal alien would-be assassin promptly dispatched down the Main Stream Media Memory Hole\u2014and the breathtaking relentless fury of his closing campaign. \\nTo adapt sprint coach Sam Mussabini\u2019s line to come-from-behind winner Eric Liddell in the old movie Chariots Of Fire: It\u2019s not the prettiest race we\u2019ve ever seen, Mr. Trump\u2014but certainly the bravest. \\nLike a lot of British emigrants\u2014I came to the U.S.in 1970 \u2014 I am mildly Anglophobic . And, although I guess I prefer slick Oxbridge Righties\u2014let\u2019s make that \u201cRighties\u201d\u2014 like Professor Andrew Roberts (pro- Thatcher , pro- Brexit ) to slick Oxbridge Lefties like Andrew Sullivan and the late Christopher Hitchens , I still found Roberts\u2019 recent Wriston Lecture, sneering snobbishly at Donald J. Trump and indeed at the whole 2016 U.S. election process, hard to take. (The Manhattan Institute has posted a video here ; there\u2019s a synopsis, and a link to an adaptation that appeared in the Wall Street Journal , here .) \\n(Interestingly, I\u2019d say at least a few of the glittering crowd of New York fat cats seemed to agree). \\nThe Wriston Lecture is black tie, which meant that my young wife began kicking me under the table with a particularly sharp-toed shoe when the Manhattan Institute\u2019s genial President, Larry Mone , [ ] asked for questions. I don\u2019t usually ask questions at these events\u2014I lack evangelical zeal\u2014but I did obediently get up and try to catch Larry\u2019s eye. \\nI\u2019ve known Larry for many years, but despite this (or perhaps because of it) he didn\u2019t call on me. \\nBut this is what I would have asked: Professor Roberts, as one Limey to another\u2014I have to say I don\u2019t think you get these Yanks. This is not the Cambridge Union. It\u2019s the Wild West. You may think Donald Trump is uncouth. But he\u2019s nowhere near as uncouth as Lyndon B. Johnson\u2014I presume you\u2019ve read Caro \u2019s biography\u2014and he was one of the seminal Presidents in American history, for better or worse. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but there was a real debate on principles in the Republican primaries. Trump is against these managed trade deals. The GOP Establishment \u2014and the entire political class\u2014is for them. Trump is against promiscuous interventions overseas\u2014in fact, he\u2019s against what both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson warned against: entangling alliances. The GOP Establishment\u2014and the entire political class\u2014is for them. Above all, Trump is against current immigration policy, which on current course will reduce whites into a minority by 204 0\u2014a demographic transformation without precedent in the history of the world. The GOP Establishment\u2014and the entire political class\u2014is for it. So there was a debate about principles\u2014and Donald Trump won. I can\u2019t recall any such principled debate in Britain\u2014with the exception of Brexit. The Establishment has got things sewn up pretty tight there. How can you not see this? (You were right about Brexit, though). \\nAs I write this, I have no idea if Donald Trump will win the Presidency. I do know that if he loses, the GOP Establishment, amid the cooing of the MSM/ Democrats, will go back to sleep on immigration, as it did after Proposition 187 in 1994, Arizona\u2019s Prop 200 in 2004, and SB 1070 in 2010, Montana\u2019s Legislative Referendum 121 in 2012 , Oregon\u2019s No On 88 initiative in 2013, and Dave Brat\u2019s primary defeat of Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014 .'"}, "time": 1742628463.8515368}
