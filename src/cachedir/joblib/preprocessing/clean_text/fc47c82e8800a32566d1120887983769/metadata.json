House of Representatives on Friday for disavowing the UN Security Council\u2019s resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity as a \u201cflagrant violation of international law. \u201d[\u201cAfter the outrageous   resolution at the UN, the U. S. House of Representatives voted yesterday resoundingly to support Israel and reject this   resolution,\u201d Netanyahu said.  \u201cI want to thank the U. S. House of Representatives, which reflects the tremendous support Israel enjoys among the American people. They voted to either repeal the resolution at the UN or change it  \u2014   and that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do. \u201d \u201cDemocrats and Republicans alike know that the Western Wall isn\u2019t occupied territory,\u201d he added. A similar measure is expected from the Senate this week. House Resolution 11 called on the U. S.  \u2014   which abstained from the Security Council vote  \u2014   to \u201coppose and veto future United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek to impose solutions to final status issues, or are   and  . \u201d \u201cThe passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 undermined the longstanding position of the United States to oppose and veto United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek to impose solutions to final status issues, or are   and   reversing decades of bipartisan agreement,\u201d the resolution continues, in reference to President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to abstain from the vote. The resolution echoes Israel\u2019s view that the UN vote will make peace even more elusive, saying it \u201cundermines the prospect of Israelis and Palestinians resuming productive, direct negotiations, contributes to the politically motivated acts of boycott, divestment from and sanctions against Israel and represents a concerted effort to extract concessions from Israel outside of direct negotiations. \u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan urged the entire House to support the resolution. \u201cI am stunned  \u2014   I am stunned at what happened last month,\u201d Ryan said in a statement on the floor. \u201cThis government, our government, abandoned our ally Israel when she needed us the most. \u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby said over the weekend that the Obama administration\u2019s decision to abstain from the vote \u201cwas about preserving the   solution, which we continue to believe is the only way to ensure Israel\u2019s future as a Jewish and a democratic state  \u2014   living    in peace and security with a viable and independent Palestinian state. \u201d However, many Republicans have expressed the view that the   solution is no longer viable. \u201cThe   solution has run its course,\u201d said Rep. Steve King ( ) who is a close confidant of the incoming Trump administration. Israel is concerned that Obama may seek more resolutions defining parameters for a peace framework at the UNSC during his final days in office. However, the president\u2019s foreign policy adviser, Ben Rhodes, has denied this and said the administration intends to use its veto. Meanwhile, Israel announced on Friday that it was cutting funding as \u201can act of protest\u201d against UN agencies that are considered to be  . \u201cIt is unreasonable for Israel to fund bodies that operate against us at the UN,\u201d Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said. \u201cThe UN must end the absurd reality in which it supports bodies whose sole intent is to spread incitement and   propaganda. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562067.878936}
