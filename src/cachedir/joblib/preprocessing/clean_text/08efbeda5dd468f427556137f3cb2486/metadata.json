The spy said the response from the FBI was \u201cshock and horror.\u201d \\nThe report alleges that Trump and his \u201cinner circle\u201d have accepted a regular \u201cflow of intelligence from the Kremlin and that Russian intelligence claims to have \u201ccompromised\u201d Trump on his visits and could \u201cblackmail him\u201d. \\nDavid Corn at Mother Jones reported: \\nMother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer\u2019s conversations with Russian sources, noted, \u201cRussian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.\u201d It maintained that Trump \u201cand his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.\u201d It claimed that Russian intelligence had \u201ccompromised\u201d Trump during his visits to Moscow and could \u201cblackmail him.\u201d It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on \u201cbugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.\u201d \\nThe former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was \u201cshock and horror.\u201d The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos\u2014some of which referred to members of Trump\u2019s inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,\u201d he says. \\nIn August, Corn reports, the FBI asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he \u201ccontinued to share information with the FBI\u201d which he says made it clear there was a \u201cpretty substantial inquiry going on.\u201d \\nIf this report is accurate, the spy\u2019s information confirms what Senator Harry Reid says intelligence experts and FBI Director James Comey already shared with him regarding \u201cexplosive information\u201d regarding ties and coordination between Donald Trump and Russia. \\nThis report also rings true given report about the Trump server repeatedly being connected to Russia, including Trump\u2019s server possibly communicating with a Russian bank. \\nIt also makes sense given the many ties to Russia within Trump\u2019s own campaign and indeed Trump\u2019s own rhetoric regarding NATO and Russia. Trump changed the Republican Party platform\u2019s pro-Ukraine proposals and talked about weakening NATO, both of which mirrored Putin\u2019s wish list. NBC reported Monday evening that the FBI is in the preliminary stages of investigating Trump\u2019s ex-campaign manager\u2019s connection to Russia. \\nDonald Trump has already been busted for reading Russian propaganda at his rallies, as Newsweek\u2019s Kurt Eichenwald uncovered an instance of Trump reading propaganda directly from Putin at a rally in Pennsylvania. \\nEichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the Russians have been hacking into American emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election, \u201cThe Russians have been obtaining American emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of them\u2014falsifying them\u2014in hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election. The big question, of course, is why are the Russians working so hard to damage Clinton and, in the process, aid Donald Trump?\u201d \\nThe answer to why Putin is trying so hard to defeat Clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her. Unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is no pushover. According to former U.S. officials, Putin sees Clinton as a \u201cforceful proponent of \u2018regime change\u2019 policies that the Russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival.\u201d \\nTrump has been acting like someone already groomed by the Kremlin. He\u2019s been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy, he is easily flattered and easily manipulated. It\u2019s also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him \u2013 see the Billy Bush bus tape of Trump bragging about sexual assault. Trump is easy bait. \\nThe fact that the FBI Director felt compelled to announce something about Hillary\u2019s emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aide\u2019s emails and even then he wasn\u2019t sure what they said or even if they were duplicates, but he chose to keep this explosive information about Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia under wraps is very disturbing. \\nThis isn\u2019t a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the FBI follows about ongoing investigations. This is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate. But the fact that they come from different sources and that Trump willingly staffed his own campaign with Russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak \u2014 these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions.'"}, "time": 1742561765.9356725}
