C. meeting in 2017 for worried elites worldwide to discuss how to deal with   Donald J. Trump. [\u201cThe World Economic Forum is listening to Donald Trump,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Stephen Morris and Erik Schatzker wrote on Sunday. \u201cThe organization will convene a special meeting in Washington this year to discuss issues raised during the  \u2019s campaign and the populist wave that swept him to victory, WEF founder Klaus Schwab told Bloomberg Television on Sunday. The gathering will explore U. S. investment and   opportunities for companies that participate in the forum, he said. \u201d  Klaus Schwab, who in 1971 founded the group that eventually became the World Economic Forum which hosts the annual retreat for business, political and cultural elites in the Swiss Alps, told Bloomberg that the event in Washington, D. C. \u2014  which was previously not planned \u2014  is going to be meant to address globalist concerns with the rise of populism as evidenced by the election of Trump to the presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s very natural that with the new administration we plan a major event in the U. S. to see what are the implications of the new president and how the business community could engage,\u201d Schwab said, adding that in Davos in 2017 there are populists present who the globalists plan to hear from to try to assuage a \u201csilent fear\u201d of the masses. \u201cPeople have become very emotionalized, this silent fear of what the new world will bring,\u201d Schwab added. \u201cWe have populists here and we want to listen. We have to respond to these individuals\u2019 fears and to offer solutions. It\u2019s not just enough to listen we have to provide answers and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for in Davos. \u201d Schwab said that the Davos gathering is not supposed to be about the glamorous parties and receptions for the elites present, or about the \u201coutrageous excesses of life\u201d exhibited by them there, but rather his goal is to create a \u201cglobal village\u201d where in the words of Morris and Schatzker \u201cparticipants can mull weighty issues facing the world without the distractions of a large city. \u201d \u201cMy biggest fear is that we will believe there are very simple answers to very difficult questions,\u201d Schwab said. \u201cThe right solution will require a lot of effort and many steps in the right direction. I am optimistic that in a new   world we still have the notion of a joined and shared destiny. \u201d In 2017, the \u201cParty of Davos\u201d so to speak, the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual gathering there in the Swiss Alps, is as Breitbart News has previously reported a gloomier event than usual. Last year, the world elites gathered in Davos were certain that British voters wouldn\u2019t vote to Leave the European Union and that Donald J. Trump would never be elected president of the United States \u2014  and that all these fears of populist uprisings around the world would never materialize. But they were wrong, and now Davos attendees are scrambling to try to figure out why.'"}, "time": 1742563348.0143127}
