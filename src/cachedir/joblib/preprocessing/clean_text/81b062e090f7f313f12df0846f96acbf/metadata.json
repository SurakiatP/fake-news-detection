These apologies are easy and usually readily accepted, often with a response like, \u201cNo problem. \u201d But when \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d are the words needed to right truly hurtful words, acts or inaction, they can be the hardest ones to utter. And even when an apology is offered with the best of intentions, it can be seriously undermined by the way in which it is worded. Instead of eradicating the emotional pain the affront caused, a poorly worded apology can result in lasting anger and antagonism, and undermine an important relationship. I admit to a lifetime of challenges when it comes to apologizing, especially when I thought I was right or misunderstood or that the offended party was being overly sensitive. But I recently discovered that the need for an apology is less about me than the person who, for whatever reason, is offended by something I said or did or failed to do, regardless of my intentions. I also learned that a sincere apology can be powerful medicine with surprising value for the giver as well as the recipient. After learning that a neighbor who had assaulted me verbally was furious about an oversight I had not known I committed, I wrote a letter in hopes of defusing the hostility. Without offering any excuses, I apologized for my lapse in etiquette and respect. I said I was not asking for or expecting forgiveness, merely that I hoped we could have a civil, if not friendly, relationship going forward, then delivered the letter with a jar of my homemade jam. Expecting nothing in return, I was greatly relieved when my doorbell rang and the neighbor thanked me warmly for what I had said and done. My relief was palpable. I felt as if I\u2019d not only discarded an enemy but made a new friend, which is indeed how it played out in the days that followed. About a week later I learned that, according to the psychologist and author Harriet Lerner, the wording of my apology was just what the \u201cdoctor\u201d would have ordered. In the very first chapter of her new book, \u201cWhy Won\u2019t You Apologize? ,\u201d Dr. Lerner points out that apologies followed by rationalizations are \u201cnever satisfying\u201d and can even be harmful. \u201cWhen \u2018but\u2019 is tagged on to an apology,\u201d she wrote, it\u2019s an excuse that counters the sincerity of the original message. The best apologies are short and don\u2019t include explanations that can undo them. Nor should a request for forgiveness be part of an apology. The offended party may accept a sincere apology but still be unready to forgive the transgression. Forgiveness, should it come, may depend on a demonstration going forward that the offense will not be repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s not our place to tell anyone to forgive or not to forgive,\u201d Dr. Lerner said in an interview. She disputes popular thinking that failing to forgive is bad for one\u2019s health and can lead to a life mired in bitterness and hate. \u201cThere is no one path to healing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many roads to letting go of corrosive emotions without forgiving, like therapy, meditation, medication, even swimming. \u201d Hardest of all, Dr. Lerner said, is to forgive a nonapologetic offender, like my aunt whom I had loved dearly and who served as my second mother after mine died. But when I, raised Jewish, married a Christian, she refused to come to the wedding and never apologized for the intense hurt her absence had caused. Although I made several attempts to restore the relationship, she always managed to deflect them, and to this day, more than half a century later, I cannot forgive her. The focus of an apology should be on what the offender has said or done, not on the person\u2019s reaction to it. Saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d shifts the focus away from the person who is supposedly apologizing and turns \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d into \u201cI\u2019m not really sorry at all,\u201d the psychologist wrote. As to why many people find it hard to offer a sincere, unfettered apology, Dr. Lerner pointed out that \u201chumans are   for defensiveness. It\u2019s very difficult to take direct, unequivocal responsibility for our hurtful actions. It takes a great deal of maturity to put a relationship or another person before our need to be right. \u201d Offering an apology is an admission of guilt that admittedly leaves people vulnerable. There\u2019s no guarantee as to how it will be received. It is the prerogative of the injured party to reject an apology, even when sincerely offered. The person may feel the offense was so enormous  \u2014   for example, having been sexually abused by a parent  \u2014   that it is impossible to accept a mea culpa offered by the abusive parent years later. Righting a perceived wrong can be especially challenging when it involves family members, who may be inclined to cite history  \u2014   he was abused by his father, or she was raised by a distant mother  \u2014   as an excuse for hurtful behavior. \u201cHistory can be used as an explanation, not an excuse,\u201d the psychologist said. \u201cIt should involve a conversation that allows the hurt party to express anger and pain if an apology, however sincere, is to heal a broken connection. \u201d As she wrote: \u201cNondefensive listening [to the hurt party] is at the heart of offering a sincere apology. \u201d She urges the listener not to \u201cinterrupt, argue, refute, or correct facts, or bring up your own criticisms and complaints. \u201d Even when the offended party is largely at fault, she suggests apologizing for one\u2019s own part in the incident, however small it may be. Dr. Lerner views apology as \u201ccentral to health, both physical and emotional. \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 are the two most healing words in the English language,\u201d she said. \u201cThe courage to apologize wisely and well is not just a gift to the injured person, who can then feel soothed and released from obsessive recriminations, bitterness and corrosive anger. It\u2019s also a gift to one\u2019s own health, bestowing   integrity and maturity  \u2014   an ability to take a cleareyed look at how our behavior affects others and to assume responsibility for acting at another person\u2019s expense. \u201d Beverly Engel, the author of \u201cThe Power of Apology,\u201d relates how her life was changed by a sincere, effective apology from her mother for years of emotional abuse. \u201cAlmost like magic,\u201d she wrote, \u201capology has the power to repair harm, mend relationships, soothe wounds and heal broken hearts. An apology actually affects the bodily functions of the person receiving it  \u2014   blood pressure decreases, heart rate slows and breathing becomes steadier. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562312.9467833}
