The Fox News pundit and Trump propagandist has been live tweeting some sort of mental breakdown and it\u2019s entirely unclear what the endgame is. \\nIt started like this: For reasons unknown, on his radio show Hannity told listeners that he would be asking Donald Trump for help in shipping the Obama family \u2013 all of whom are Americans \u2013 to Kenya after the election. \\nIf you\u2019re saying to yourself \u201cWow, that sounds pretty racist\u201d the answer is yes, yes it is . There is no universe in which a person telling America\u2019s first black president to go back to Africa cannot be construed as a racist statement. That is, unless you happen to reside in the fantasy world that Sean Hannity currently lives in. \\nAfter getting rightfully hammered for the comments, Hannity either got very drunk or had a psychotic break and tweeted out a profoundlymisspelled defense of what he said. The tweets wouldn\u2019t pass a breathalyzer. \\nTweet #1 (now deleted): \\nLiberal media. It\u2019s was Josh Ernest who refuse to amswee teh ? Will Obama stay in the US if DT wins. I mentioned I\u2019d pay a charter to \u2026 \\n\u201camswee teh ?\u201d Really? \\nTweet #2 (now deleted): \\nLiberal media 2 Any country they choose. 1- Canada where the satire piece was written Kenya where he visited \\nThe second tweet also linked to the website of infamous conservative provocateur Chuck Johnson, a racist white nationalist who once proposed the theory that Obama was a gay prostitute. Johnson is so morally repugnant that he was officially permanently banned from ever holding an account on Twitter. \\nAfter waking up, Hannity got back on Twitter to do damage control. According to him, these incoherent cries for help weren\u2019t what they looked like, he just didn\u2019t have his glasses on\u2026 Half asleep and didn't put my glasses on. Lol. I wish I had a better excuse. https://t.co/GUvw7ef2AV \\n\u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 27, 2016 \\nHe also doubled down on his defense of telling Obama to go to Africa. I said I'll send him anywhere he wants to go. I mentioned Canada first, Kenya where part of his family is today, Jakarta where he once lived https://t.co/wvNxCMTXYu \\n\u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 27, 2016 \\nNone of which \u201canswee teh ?\u201d of why the Obama family should be exiled to another country in the first place. Glasses or not, that\u2019s a level of fascist thinking that has been relatively unthinkable in American democracy. Only since the rise of Trump, and his avowed policy of going after his political and personal enemies after he\u2019s elected, would the idea of banning a former president from the country even be imagined. Now it\u2019s being normalized by a Fox News pundit with an audience of millions. \\nSean Hannity has been a hack for many years, but Donald Trump finally completely severed his grip on reality. We\u2019re witnessing what happens when a man with major delusions gets to indulge them in front of an audience of millions each night on a major network \u2013 and it isn\u2019t pretty. \\nFeatured image via Fox News Share this Article!\""}, "time": 1742562193.6426408}
