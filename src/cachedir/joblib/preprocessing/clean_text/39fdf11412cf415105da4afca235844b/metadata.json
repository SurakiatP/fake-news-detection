[The new figure, equivalent \u00a384. 5 billion, reflects stricter demands made by Germany and France, in particular in relation to   farm payments and EU administration fees, according to an analysis by the Financial Times.  European Commission president   Juncker and chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier have previously said the UK would be expected to pay around \u20ac60 billion (\u00a350. 75 billion). The British Government\u2019s lawyers, however, and a House of Lords committee have said the UK has no legal responsibility to pay the \u00a350 billion bill and the prime minister is opposed to handing over a large amount. David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, reiterated these claims Wednesday morning, as well as implying the escalating demands were merely part of the EU\u2019s negotiating tactics. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme Wednesday morning, Mr. Davis said recent comments from his European partners should be \u201ctaken with a pinch of salt\u201d. \u201cYou have seen in the mixture of gossip and spin there are attempts to shape opinions, try to put across robust points of view,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is merely preliminary to negotiations. The simple truth is that this is early manoeuvring. We have to deal with it with equanimity. \u201d Speaking to ITV Tuesday night, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ll not be paying 100 billion. What we\u2019ve got to do is discuss in detail what the rights and obligations are. \u201d The rising bill reflects a hardening of the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiating stance. According to the Financial Times, the French and Polish governments have pushed for the inclusion of   annual farm payments, whilst the Germans are against granting Britain a share of EU assets. The UK would also be held to guarantees and loans to countries such as Ukraine and Portugal, with Britain being reimbursed as the loans are repaid. Over the period of a decade or more, therefore, the repayments would reduce the net size of the \u201cBrexit bill\u201d to between \u20ac55 billion and \u20ac75 billion. Mr. Barnier has previously said the UK will not be able to begin discussions on a future trade deal with the bloc, or guarantee the rights of UK citizens in the EU, until the bill is settled.'"}, "time": 1742561663.008227}
