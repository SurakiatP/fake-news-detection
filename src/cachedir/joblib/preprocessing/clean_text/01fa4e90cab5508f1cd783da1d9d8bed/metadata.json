News of the shootings, which took place last Wednesday, was quickly eclipsed by other developments in Washington, and even in Kansas, but the same cannot be said of the Sharma household of Mumbai, where Ms. Sharma has received emphatic maternal lectures about her plans to move, starting first thing in the morning. \u201cShe asked me: \u2018Why do you even need to go to the States? Why do you need to go to a country that doesn\u2019t want you? I\u2019m going to be scared for your life every day,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sharma said. Even as she endeavored, patiently, to convey to her mother the difference between Kansas and New York City, where she hopes to move, Ms. Sharma felt her own apprehensions growing, as the days passed and President Trump made no statement on the crime. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely very scary for me at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if a brown person is dead, like it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201d The body of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, the    software engineer fatally shot in the Olathe, Kan. bar, was expected to arrive by Monday in Hyderabad, a technology hub where immigration to the United States has long been viewed as the surest path to success. Indians were relatively welcoming of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, and many here express admiration for his business empire and promised crackdown on terrorism. But even before Wednesday\u2019s shootings, that optimism had been diluted by fears that America might no longer welcome immigrants. India is second only to China as a feeder to American colleges, with around 165, 000 students enrolled in the   school year, according to the Institute of International Education. Indians are the largest recipients of temporary skilled worker visas, known as   visas, which the Trump administration intends to cut back. And close to half a million Indians, who mostly went to the United States legally as students or tourists or on work visas, have stayed on after their visas expired, the Pew Research Center estimates. Reports of rising American hostility toward immigrants have stunned many Indians, said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who visited Hyderabad recently. \u201cI had a guy on a plane sitting next to me, who turned to me and said, \u2018Is it true, what they say about America under Trump? \u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a kind of confusion: What is happening to the United States? People can\u2019t believe what they\u2019re reading. \u201d Ill treatment of Indian immigrants has, in the past, caused serious damage to bilateral relationships. In 2009 and 2010, reports of racially motivated crimes against Indian students in Australia set off demonstrations outside the Australian Embassy in New Delhi, where Australia\u2019s prime minister was burned in effigy. After that, the number of Indians applying for student visas plunged by nearly half, with severe costs to Australian educational institutions. The diplomatic effect of the shootings in Kansas has been muted so far. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not commented on them, though the subject will certainly be raised this week, along with the thorny issue of curtailing   visas, when Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visits Washington. Some Indians who had planned to go to the United States said they were hesitating. Manavi Das, who is considering several universities, said she was \u201cconstantly looking to see if the school is in a red state, or has witnessed a shooting in recent times. \u201cAfter a certain event in November,\u201d she said, \u201cI have found my apprehensions turned up a notch. \u201d Sunny Choudhary, 23, said he had decided not to apply to graduate engineering programs in the United States, because \u201crecent conditions, they are turning into, I think, hostile conditions. \u201d After Mr. Trump was elected, he added, \u201cmy parents said: \u2018No, you should not go there. Now we won\u2019t let you go there.\u2019 \u201d He said that, like many of his friends, he had narrowed his search to Europe. And some Indian parents could use their persuasive talents to encourage their children to return home. \u201cFor this   period, after the transfer of regimes, I think Indians can come back and serve their country,\u201d said Suguna Kadiyala, 73, whose daughter has been in the United States for 20 years. Nageswara Rao, 71, whose son and daughter work in the software sector in the United States, said he was \u201cnot much worried,\u201d though he does dispense regular advice on safety measures. \u201cIt is always better to keep away from bars,\u201d he said. His children are safe, he added, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t go to these bars where white people are more. \u201d He continued, \u201cI give them advice to be a little bit careful and don\u2019t get into a wrangle with anybody. Just have your own peaceful life. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562131.7321548}
