On Nov. 8, Stephen Colbert was hosting a live election night special for CBS\u2019s sister cable network, Showtime. A program that was built around an expected Hillary Clinton victory went off the rails almost as soon as it went on the air at 11 p. m. As election returns came in, audience members, who had been asked to shut off their phones an hour earlier, gasped as it became clear that Donald J. Trump could very well become president. Mr. Colbert looked dumbstruck. Sensing the gravity of the moment, Chris Licht, the executive producer of \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d walked over to Mr. Colbert\u2019s desk during a musical performance. \u201cStop being funny and go and just be real,\u201d Mr. Licht told the host. What followed was what Mr. Licht described in a recent interview as the turning point for Mr. Colbert, who had struggled to gain his footing on CBS after shedding the    character that made him famous on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cColbert Report. \u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s when he became himself,\u201d he said. Five months later, \u201cThe Late Show\u201d has done what a year ago seemed unthinkable: It has become the most viewed show in late night. Mr. Colbert\u2019s show has reeled off nine consecutive weeks of ratings victories over Jimmy Fallon\u2019s   \u201cTonight Show,\u201d and is poised to make it 10 in a row when the latest numbers come out on Tuesday. NBC executives have taken solace in the fact that Mr. Fallon still commands a lead in the age demographic vital to advertisers, and are skeptical that this Colbert surge will last forever. It is more than possible that Mr. Colbert and Mr. Fallon, over time, could settle into a battle that will go back and forth. But at this time last year, Mr. Colbert was losing by more than a million viewers to Mr. Fallon and feeling pressure from within CBS, which had named him the successor to David Letterman with much fanfare. The company\u2019s chief executive, Leslie Moonves, had serious concerns about the show, and the network\u2019s 12:35 a. m. host, James Corden, was outshining him. And now? \u201cIt\u2019s pizza day,\u201d Mr. Colbert said in his   office last Tuesday. Throughout the offices of \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d staff members could be heard saying, \u201cPizza! Pizza!\u201d  \u2014   celebrating a reward that comes on Tuesdays when they beat \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in the ratings. Just like \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and MSNBC\u2019s   lineup, Mr. Colbert has benefited from his decidedly   point of view. But even though Mr. Trump\u2019s victory appears to have   turned the   comedy race upside down, Mr. Colbert\u2019s rise is the product of months of meticulous work. The goal: to earn the chance to be  \u2014   as Mr. Licht put it  \u2014   \u201cresampled\u201d by viewers. For its first six months, \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d which debuted in September 2015, was adrift. Mr. Moonves was concerned enough to express his frustrations to Mr. Colbert over dinner at the 21 Club in Manhattan, shortly after a live edition of the show fizzled despite a prime spot immediately after the Super Bowl in February 2016. Chief among Mr. Moonves\u2019s concerns was how uncomfortable Mr. Colbert looked on a big stage. He thought the host was worrying over too many trivial details, from the stage lighting down to the color of the dressing rooms. \u201cOn the old show, all of us handled all those responsibilities,\u201d Mr. Colbert said, acknowledging that the CBS show was a much bigger undertaking. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a control freak, and everything  \u2014   everything  \u2014   went through my skull. \u201d Within weeks, Mr. Colbert conceded that a change had to be made. And Mr. Moonves turned to Mr. Licht, an executive producer who had been a career newsman. \u201cI set up a blind date, and I held my breath,\u201d Mr. Moonves said. Mr. Licht, 45, had created a hit as the founding executive producer of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and then accomplished something no one had done before him: He created a morning show on CBS that actually drew some ratings. The TV world rolled its eyes when CBS paired Charlie Rose with Gayle King on \u201cCBS This Morning. \u201d But Mr. Licht found success in allowing the   along with Norah O\u2019Donnell, to be themselves and to talk freely about the most pressing topics of the day. Viewers responded. When Mr. Moonves approached him about Mr. Colbert, Mr. Licht said he didn\u2019t watch the show he quickly burned through several episodes. \u201cMy cleareyed scouting report was: \u2018This is all over the place. This doesn\u2019t seem cohesive, which suggests to me that behind the scenes, it\u2019s chaotic,\u2019\u201d Mr. Licht said. Then he and Mr. Colbert sat down for a   drink. They hit it off instantly. \u201cThe deal was, he said, \u2018Listen, let me make these decisions and don\u2019t try to take them back from me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Colbert remembered. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018O. K. well, don\u2019t debate with me what\u2019s funny. \u2019\u201d So Mr. Colbert focused on the comedy and his performance, and Mr. Licht dealt with management issues that the host had been expending energy on: staffing, budgets, sales meetings, the works. Mr. Licht also made changes to the show, including shortening the opening credits and giving \u201cThe Late Show\u201d a signature segment by preceding those credits with a comedy sketch. Within two months, he suggested regularly doing live shows after major events. If the show was going to become   on the news, he said, this only made sense. It also brought a necessary rigor to the staff. Mr. Colbert had done, by his estimation, about a dozen live shows over 10 years at \u201cThe Colbert Report. \u201d Over the past nine months, he has done 15. He pointed to the live shows he did during the political conventions as truly  . \u201cTwo weeks of that changed all of our approach to the show, and it also changed the trust I had to place in my staff,\u201d Mr. Colbert said. \u201cYou cannot do two weeks of live shows and be a control freak. \u201d Mr. Colbert became much more forgiving of \u201ca flub here or a flub there,\u201d Mr. Licht said. That is a valuable lesson, said Mr. Licht, who believes that certain imperfections foster intimacy with the audience. \u201cAt \u2018CBS This Morning,\u2019 I said, \u2018Guys, there are going to be mornings where Charlie\u2019s tired and he doesn\u2019t smile, and we\u2019re going to have to live with that,\u2019\u201d Mr. Licht said. \u201c\u2018Gayle is going to ask questions at the wrong time, and we\u2019re going to have live with that. \u2019\u201d He continued: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to manufacture perfection. Then you build authenticity, and they become more comfortable with each other. Your job as a producer, in my mind, is to allow that to happen and get out of the way. \u201d Then, in September, on NBC, Mr. Fallon tousled Mr. Trump\u2019s hair when he was a guest on his show, causing an uproar. Some critics of Mr. Fallon say that moment was the breaking point that led to his declining ratings this year. \u201cThe theory that that hair tousle made a difference is based on the supposition that Jimmy\u2019s fans went to him for political acumen,\u201d Mr. Colbert said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. They go there for fun. They go there for his nature, his spirit. \u201d Mr. Colbert and his writing staff, meanwhile, developed a   point of view on how they felt about Mr. Trump. Mr. Colbert\u2019s election night special on Showtime attracted only 238, 000 viewers, fewer than a tenth of his usual viewership. But in the final minutes of the show, Mr. Colbert scrapped a prepared closing monologue about the importance of coming together after a polarizing election, and went  off script. He was personal, and he discussed, bluntly, the searing divides in the country. \u201cYou stripped away script, you stripped away everything,\u201d Mr. Licht said. \u201cAnd you leave this bare, exposed human being. \u201d That moment, Mr. Colbert said, was possible only because of the live shows he had done in the previous months. \u201cThat\u2019s when it changed for us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when it started to feel like when you walk off the stage and say, \u2018God, what a great freaking job, that I get to do this! \u2019\u201d (He used slightly more colorful language.) Two weeks into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, Mr. Colbert beat Mr. Fallon for the first time. Beyond the political moment, however, Mr. Colbert said he felt more comfortable on the Ed Sullivan Theater stage than ever before. \u201cI always had to keep a certain amount of distance as the character,\u201d he said of his time at Comedy Central. \u201cI always had to be a little of a facsimile of me that they were getting  \u2014   obviously because I was playing somebody named me who wasn\u2019t me, but even on top of that there was a little bit more of a distance from the audience. \u201d Mr. Colbert runs out onto the stage every night these days, and   audience members in the front row. A cameraman circles around him, and Mr. Colbert looks directly into the lenses and says, \u201cHey. \u201d Mr. Licht said Mr. Colbert had started doing that on his own just about three months ago, a brief, intimate moment between the host and the viewer, watching at home, right before bed. \u201cI\u2019m so much more comfortable on my feet now,\u201d Mr. Colbert said. \u201cI\u2019m a quicker and better writer. I am more comfortable being myself in front of an audience. I like this new relationship with the audience. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563862.8800364}
