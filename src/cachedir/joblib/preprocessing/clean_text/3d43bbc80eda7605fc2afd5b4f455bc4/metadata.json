If he can find a way to rein in some of  \u2014   some of the more unhealthy impulses, listen to his staff, bring on a full complement of political appointees who will help him govern. \u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m very concerned about the tweets, obviously,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cAnd very concerned about the direction we\u2019re taking in a lot of  \u2014   in a lot of national security areas.
