Proposition 227 required all public schools in the state teach \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d in English, with limited-English proficiency (LEP) students transitioning to fully English classes as quickly as possible. \\n{snip} \\nAcross the state, the English proficiency of LEP students tripled in just a few years , and math scores rose as well. \\nBut now, with California\u2019s immigrant population higher than ever, the state is poised to reverse course. \\nPolls indicate the Proposition 58 is likely to pass. Ironically, supporters of the measure place an emphasis on English rather than foreign tongues. They argue that the bill will allow for \u201cdual immersion\u201d programs, where both native English and native Spanish speakers can learn in a bilingual environment. In the long run, they argue, this will increase multilingualism and provide the state with a competitive advantage. \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742564611.7649412}
