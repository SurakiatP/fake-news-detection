The supermoon occurs when the moon is slightly closer to Earth than it typically is, and the effect is most noticeable when it occurs around the same time as a full moon. \\nIt can appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than usual, according to NASA. \\nThe word supermoon was coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle, AccuWeather\u2019s Mark Paquette says. Nolle used the term to describe a new or full moon that occurs when the moon is at or near its closest approach to Earth. \\nInstead of a supermoon, astronomy site Slooh.com is calling it a \u201cmega beaver moon,\u201d which includes the moon\u2019s folklore name for November. \\nAccording to the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac , the November moon was named the beaver moon partly because, \u201cfor both the colonists and the Algonquin tribes, this was the time to set beaver traps before the swamps froze, to ensure a supply of warm winter furs.\u201d \\nContributing: Mary Bowerman, USA TODAY \\nFollow @MaryBowerman on Twitter.
