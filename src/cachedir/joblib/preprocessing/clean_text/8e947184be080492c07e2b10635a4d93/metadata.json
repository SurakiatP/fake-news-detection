[I will end common core. It\u2019s a disaster. https:  . #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 pic. twitter.   \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2016,   On Monday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said, \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any Common Core anymore,\u201d citing the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) which was passed in 2015. ESSA, she claims, \u201cdoes away with the whole argument about Common Core. \u201d The secretary\u2019s comments came just several weeks after Trump returned to his   campaign statement that he wanted to end Common Core and make education policy once again the domain of state and local governments. \u201cCommon Core, I mean, we have to bring education more local,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe can\u2019t be managing education from Washington. \u201d The president continued: When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally and they\u2019ll do a much better job  \u2026     And I like the fact of getting rid of Common Core. You know, Common Core, to me, we have to end it. We have to bring education local, to me. I\u2019ve always said it, I\u2019ve been saying it during the campaign, and we\u2019re doing it. While campaigning in 2016  \u2014   after the enactment of ESSA  \u2014   Trump listened to millions of grassroots parents and teachers who asked him to cut off federal funding for and end the superstructures that made Common Core possible in the first place. \u201cCommon Core is a disaster,\u201d Trump noted time and again. While he provided few details of his education plan, he acknowledged the frustration of parents in their attempt to eradicate the Common Core system of math and English language arts standards and tests, and the accompanying massive student data collection, in their states. \u201cFor the first time in any presidential campaign, an education issue claimed a place of importance with grassroots citizens,\u201d writes American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins at the Library of Law and Liberty, explaining the basis for the grassroots\u2019 ire at the progressive Common Core policies: In the early days of Common Core, almost no one outside the federal and state education bureaucracies or the insular world of \u201ceducation reform\u201d had ever heard of it \u2014  even though the standards would ignite the largest   grassroots movement in American history. Common Core was adopted by state executive branch officials in response to \u201cincentives\u201d from federal executive branch officials, with (in almost every case) no consent from or even notice to elected state legislators. In a joint statement to Breitbart News, parent activists Heidi Huber of Ohio and Jenni White of Oklahoma agree \u201cthe very reason   billionaire Donald Trump appealed to the everyday   Core mom is because he appeared to understand the kitchen table politics of grassroots America. \u201d Toward the end of his campaign, Trump\u2019s message about ending Common Core was overshadowed by a new message about school choice  \u2014   one that received significant attention with the announcement of DeVos as his selection for federal education secretary. DeVos had been a major backer of school choice and school vouchers in her home state of Michigan. She had also been a supporter of Jeb Bush and his education foundation, and, ultimately, served as an   delegate for establishment Republican candidate John Kasich at the GOP convention. Meanwhile, grassroots parent groups in Michigan also noted that DeVos lent financial and service support to organizations that promoted the Common Core. Upon her nomination by Trump, however, DeVos denied she supported the Core. \u201cI do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen Governors such as John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense. \u201d DeVos\u2019s nomination was accompanied by a level of controversy rarely seen for an education secretary. The left  \u2014   led by teachers unions  \u2014   began to work against her because of her support for school choice which, they claimed, would redirect funding from public schools. The mainstream media focused its energy on the battle between its own leftwing public school supporters and \u201cconservative\u201d DeVos. As the left often does, it also often made the decision to mock the secretary unfairly, rather than deal with her on the actual issues. After a very shaky confirmation process  \u2014   which required Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie vote in the Senate  \u2014   DeVos was finally confirmed. But the controversy continued within the GOP as the secretary began to fill her department with many individuals with ties to   Core Jeb Bush, as well as Indiana  \u2014   where Common Core was \u201crepealed,\u201d but then simply \u201crebranded\u201d with a new name. Trump\u2019s constitutionalist base continued the drumbeat on eliminating the U. S. Education Department and Washington bureaucrats\u2019 influence on local education policy. Two bills were introduced in Congress with that end in mind, one by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie (R) and the other by North Carolina Rep. David Rouzer (R). Though DeVos has continued with comments that Common Core is no longer an issue because of its elimination through ESSA, those who have studied the federal law and observed the secretary\u2019s choice of staffers say her comments are typical of the establishment GOP. According to Huber and White, \u201cTrump\u2019s selection of Betsy DeVos was not only disappointing, it telegraphed more of the same tone deafness of the previous administration. \u201d \u201cBetsy DeVos was confirmed and began assembling a team of staffers, most of whom represent pretty establishment Republican experience and positions,\u201d Joy Pullman, managing editor at The Federalist, also tells Breitbart News. The author of a newly released book, The Education Invasion: How Common Core Fights Parents for Control of American Kids, Pullman notes that while school choice is a positive goal, the idea that the federal government should be involved in regulating it in any way suggests the Trump education department is not planning on reducing its influence, as Trump had originally promised. She explains: Everyone without financial or political incentives to the contrary, such as teachers unions, knows that choice exists and it generally works. The real conversation is whether government will destroy it by using laws and regulations to commandeer private and charter options or stay true to the promise of the word \u201cchoice\u201d and truly let parents control the style and content of their children\u2019s curricula. Many questions remain unanswered about the Trump administration\u2019s leadership on these issues, and there has been absolutely no action on Trump\u2019s repeated campaign pledge to \u201celiminate Common Core. \u201d On the plus side, Trump signed legislation in March that, via the Congressional Review Act, rolled back two   education policies  \u2014   one regarding teacher training programs, and another regarding meeting some ESSA directives. The ESSA rule concerned states\u2019 accountability in identifying failing schools and reporting their plans for improving them to the federal government. Nevertheless, ESSA still requires states to submit their overall education plans to the U. S. Education Department. In March, DeVos\u2019s office released a new guide on how states may fulfill their requirement to the federal government. The guide features a \u201crevised template\u201d offered by the education department itself, and adds that two private groups  \u2014   the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association  \u2014   both of which own the copyright to the Common Core standards, may assist states with an \u201calternative template. \u201d Ann Marie Banfield, education liaison with the New   Cornerstone Research and Policy Institute, tells Breitbart News DeVos\u2019s messages are at odds with how Trump campaigned on education issues: Trump campaigned with the promise to get rid of Common Core and even referenced Gov. Jeb Bush as someone who supported the federal education reform that parents never asked for. The appointment of Betsy DeVos has left many of us underwhelmed and disappointed. You don\u2019t appoint a Jeb Bush crony and expect parents who\u2019ve been fighting against Common Core to be thrilled. In February, conflict between Trump and DeVos was reported by the New York Times, as the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned Obama\u2019s   directive, which effectively permitted children to change their sex by simply declaring they have the \u201cgender identity\u201d of the other sex. DeVos reportedly objected to changing Obama\u2019s policy, but was overruled by Trump and Sessions. Pullman observes that Trump\u2019s rollback of Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance is \u201ca win, but it was done over the objections of Secretary DeVos, which is worrisome. \u201d \u201cEven if you think it\u2019s okay to force naked boy bodies and naked girl bodies into the same private facilities, the federal government has no authority to do what Obama\u2019s Education and Justice departments did in this regard,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe would ask president Trump  \u2014   as he completes the first 100 days of his administration  \u2014   to consider the tens of thousands of parents who believed his promise to end Common Core, and implore him to invite leading parent activists to the table,\u201d say Huber and White. \u201cIt would undoubtedly benefit President Trump, but more importantly, it would serve the children he promised to deliver from the special interests of the FedEd complex. \u201d Emmett McGroarty, senior fellow at American Principles Project, tells Breitbart News DeVos is not supporting Trump in his stated education agenda. \u201cSecretary DeVos is undermining the Trump presidency,\u201d he asserts. \u201cGreat presidents have a great vision and are able to bring it into reality. That invariably means overcoming the timid in their own administration and in Congress. That\u2019s the hurdle President Trump faces. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628313.5199955}
