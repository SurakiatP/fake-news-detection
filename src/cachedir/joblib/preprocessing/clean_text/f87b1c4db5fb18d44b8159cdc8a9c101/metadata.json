Yale College Republicans barbecuing by union fast site pic. twitter.   \u2014   gabrielwinant (@gabrielwinant) April 28, 2017,  The hunger strike concerned Yale\u2019s unwillingness to negotiate a contract with its graduate teachers, who voted to unionize in February. The union, known as Local 33, is a subgroup of the international labor union UNITE HERE. The university\u2019s refusal is currently being appealed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) with the university reportedly hoping to hold out until Donald Trump appoints a new batch of   members to the NLRB. Asked about his reaction to the barbecue, Local 33 Chairman Aaron Greenberg told The New Haven Register, \u201cI\u2019m not really focused on that. I\u2019m focused on making sure we have lots of water, make sure I\u2019m healthy. We have a check in with our nurse this afternoon. We are focused on that. \u201d In fliers distributed before the strike, the organizers asked others to participate with them in solidarity, urging people to \u201csit with us and lift our spirits,\u201d and \u201c[join in] when one of us cannot continue. \u201d Greenberg also attacked the university for \u201csiding with Donald Trump over members of their own community\u201d by taking an   stance. \u201cI think that is unacceptable. I think that is despicable. They say we have to wait, so we are waiting without eating,\u201d he said.
