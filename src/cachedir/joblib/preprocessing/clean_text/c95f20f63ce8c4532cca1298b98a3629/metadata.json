Performed during a matinee show at the MGM Grand Hospital yesterday, health care personnel applaud the act, calling it the best combination of entertainment and treatment in recent memory. \\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been much to write about since Philip Rogers rode in a wheelchair through a halfpipe back in 2001,\u201d wrote local entertainment reporter Eva Roberts. \u201cAll we\u2019ve had is magic mouthwash and pet therapy , but that\u2019s about it. McDowell\u2019s death-defying leap against patient safety precautions was a much needed breath of fresh air.\u201d Thankfully, the Joint Commission wasn\u2019t there to witness it. \\nThe 55-year-old McDowell has always been a lifelong adventurer. His youth saw participation in skateboarding, snowboarding, and motocross biking until \u201ca few too many broken bones \u201d sidelined him for good over two decades ago. However, it was during this most recent hospitalization that McDowell felt the old itch come back and thought the hospital was just the place to get things started. \\n\u201cThe way I saw it, the worst thing that happens, I get set on fire and there\u2019s a burn unit right here; or if I broke a bone, I knew ortho , PT, and OT would be ready and waiting,\u201d explained McDowell. \u201cBest case scenario I\u2019ve provided a hospital, a setting not typically known for world-class entertainment, something to talk about for weeks, months, maybe even years to come.\u201d McDowell idolized Rogers and his wheelchair X Games jumps, and wanted to make a name for himself in a hospital one day. \\nAfter convincing his transport tech to arrange the ramps accordingly and give him a good running push, McDowell used his arms and body to steer the hospital bed before he took off \u201clike a Haldol blowdart ,\u201d guiding himself through the heart of the ring of fire. His landing was perfect, no bedsheets were singed, and everyone there to witness the feat got on their feet to give McDowell a rousing standing ovation . \\nThough McDowell is being treated for asthma exacerbation, he reassures his family, friends, and Gomerblog that the smoke inhalation while passing through the smoky ring of fire was \u201cminimal,\u201d\u201cworth it,\u201d and \u201cbetter than a ring of my aunt\u2019s perfume.\u201d \\nMcDowell finishes an albuterol nebulizer treatment, takes the mask off, and hacks up some charred mucous. \u201cIf it brought a smile to even one person who looked up from their charting , it was worth it, it was totally worth it.\u201d 87 Shares '"}, "time": 1742562737.4909503}
