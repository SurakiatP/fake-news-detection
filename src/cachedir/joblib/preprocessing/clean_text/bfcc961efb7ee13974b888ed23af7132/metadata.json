On his way home from a conference of Democratic attorneys general in Florida, Mr. Ferguson landed a week ago in the center of a political and legal firestorm.   International Airport was in disarray, with protests massing. Gov. Jay Inslee, a fellow Democrat, had sent word to the attorney general\u2019s staff that he wanted to mount a   attack on the president\u2019s decree. Within two days, Mr. Ferguson had become a leading combatant in a battle with the president of the United States, filing a dramatic challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban that yielded a ruling from a federal judge on Friday freezing the order\u2019s implementation. A genial    with an earnest demeanor, Mr. Ferguson cuts an unlikely figure as an antagonist for the most pugilistic president in modern times. He is seen in the state less as a   showman than as a former member of the King County Council with a wonky sensibility and an eager manner. But Mr. Ferguson, by his own account and the description of his associates, was incensed and offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s sweeping immigration restrictions. And having landed in Seattle on the first full day the ban was in effect  \u2014   while demonstrations grew across the country  \u2014   he went home to greet his family and then went to work devising a plan to cripple Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy. In an interview, Mr. Ferguson said he had concluded from the start that Mr. Trump\u2019s order was \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional,\u201d and that any appropriate response would have to aim at neutering it entirely. Eschewing the approach of other   states, which have challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s order by highlighting the claims of individual plaintiffs, Mr. Ferguson and his office opted to draft a complaint arguing that the ban would cause drastic damage to Washington State as a whole. Mr. Ferguson said that the state solicitor general, Noah Purcell, a former Supreme Court clerk for David H. Souter, had suggested last weekend that the state enlist major private companies as allies. And so the attorney general spoke by telephone with a host of executives, including the corporate counsels of Expedia and Amazon, who agreed to supply forceful declarations for the state\u2019s suit, describing the damage that the White House order could inflict. Mr. Ferguson said he had recognized at the time that this was a potentially risky approach, seeking a more sweeping victory with a comparatively untested legal strategy. But Mr. Ferguson, a former state chess champion, explained in precise language that he had decided it was a gamble worth taking. \u201cFrom my standpoint there is risk in everything, but I am someone who believes in calculated risk,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said in the interview. \u201cOne just needs to be comfortable with that. And when it comes to the constitutional rights of my people, the people I represent, I\u2019m prepared to take a calculated risk on their behalf. \u201d Mr. Inslee, also in an interview, said he strongly backed Mr. Ferguson\u2019s approach, viewing Mr. Trump\u2019s order as a unique threat to their state\u2019s economy, which depends heavily on international trade, and to the state\u2019s diverse population. In his view, the governor said, the state was right to make \u201cany plausible claim\u201d to take down the order. Few other states adopted such a daring strategy. Mr. Ferguson said he had invited other Democratic attorneys general to join in his lawsuit, finding only one taker so far: Lori Swanson of Minnesota. Mr. Ferguson said there were other states still weighing whether to join him. Mr. Inslee described the Friday ruling as a special kind of victory for Washington State, which draws relatively little attention in national politics but tends to race ahead of national trends on social issues. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our nature and history,\u201d Mr. Inslee said. \u201cThis is the first time this administration has been reined in. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561736.359563}
