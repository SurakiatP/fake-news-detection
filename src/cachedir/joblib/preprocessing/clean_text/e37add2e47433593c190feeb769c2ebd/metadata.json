[The series  \u2014   which wrapped production in March  \u2014   will follow the legendarily   insult comic as he dines out with and interviews Hollywood celebrities at his favorite Los Angeles restaurants.  Judging by the trailer, the   season will include interviews with Sarah Silverman, Zach Galifianakis, Jimmy Kimmel, Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler. Rickles also reportedly interviewed Martin Scorsese, Billy Crystal, Vince Vaughn, Marisa Tomei and Robert De Niro. The trailer features classic Rickles   including a great one on Poehler. After Poehler tells him how honored she is to be able to get to talk to him, Rickles replies: \u201cThat\u2019s really sweet. When your name came up, I said \u2018I don\u2019t want her.\u2019 And they said, \u2018Be nice, she needs it. \u2019\u201d Galifianakis also earned Rickles\u2019 approval with a zinger of his own. Dinner with Don is the first project from AARP Studios.
