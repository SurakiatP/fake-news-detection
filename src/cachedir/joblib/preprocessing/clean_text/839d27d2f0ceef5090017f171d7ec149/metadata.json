[A who\u2019  of stars  \u2014   including actresses Sally Field and Rosie Perez, Westworld star Jeffrey Wright, comedian   Key, Boardwalk Empire actor Steve Buscemi and other activists  \u2014   appear in the video released Tuesday, titled \u201c#StandUpForUS. \u201d   \u201cWe demand that you block nominees who threaten the rights of women, the LGBT community, people of color, immigrants and the poor,\u201d Key and Field say in the video. The message is meant to encourage the \u201cdear members of Congress,\u201d the entertainers say, to \u201cvigorously oppose\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cracist, sexist,           policies. \u201d \u201cThe majority of Americans, regardless of who they voted for, did not vote for racism, for sexism, or for xenophobia. And yet, Donald Trump won,\u201d the various stars recite. Supporters are asked to spread the video on social media and sign a petition posted on the   website MoveOn. org. \u201cWe won\u2019t remain silent. We\u2019ll work harder to mobilize our votes, and our communities. But we need you and expect you to have our backs,\u201d the stars and activists say. It\u2019s the first   political PSA of the year, after a number of similar videos were released in the   to November\u2019s presidential election. Last month, actor Martin Sheen led a group of celebrities in a video PSA which urged Republican electors in the Electoral College to ignore their states\u2019 voting results and vote to deny Donald Trump the presidency.
