They\u2019re nervous. They\u2019re frightened about what they see happening to the American government. And this Trump regime \u2014  I don\u2019t call it an administration, I call it a regime. That\u2019s how they act. They have appointed several former generals, that\u2019s very   to the rest of the world. They have billionaires who have been appointed to cabinet positions, some of whom have no experience whatsoever in the field in which they are now in charge. That\u2019s very frightening to people. \u201d \u201cCronyism at the highest levels has many people in this country nervous and around the world as well,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s going to be plenty of opportunities in the future, unfortunately, for the American people to express themselves, and I think we as Democrats will be able to support that effort when we believe it\u2019s warranted. \u201d (  Grabien) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562831.7256277}
