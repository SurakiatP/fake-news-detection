There are indications the casino magnate will pony up even more by the end of the week. \\nTwo senior Republican sources familiar with the donation described it to Fox News as a \u201cmassive\u201d amount of money to be spent during the final week of the presidential race and a sign that Adelson, who has largely been on the sidelines after initially suggesting he would give $100 million to help Donald Trump, is now going all in on the Republican nominee. GOP donors pouring-last minute money into the race: \\nThe money will benefit Future 45 , a Super PAC launched by the Ricketts family in Chicago, founders of TD Ameritrade. The group has recently been running a television ad in battlegrounds comparing Clinton to Richard Nixon, calling her a \u201csecretive, paranoid politician who destroyed 30,000 pieces of evidence.\u201d \\nThe Republican sources said the contribution was made in the last few days as the FBI re-ignited its investigation of Clinton\u2019s email server, and could spark other big GOP donors \u2013 who may have thought the Democratic nominee was coasting to victory just days ago \u2014 to step up their support of Trump in the final days. \\nMost importantly, one source familiar with the Adelson contribution revealed he is considering pouring as much as another $25 million dollars into the race before Election Day on November 8. \\nThe first major contribution came as Trump visited Adelson\u2019s Venetian resort and casino in Las Vegas for a rally with supporters on Sunday. Trump praised Adelson and his wife, Miriam, without any reference to the money that went to the Super PAC. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.
