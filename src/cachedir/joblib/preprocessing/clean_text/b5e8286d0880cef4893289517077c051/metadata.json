What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at europebriefing@nytimes. com. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 The Iraqi government has begun its battle to reclaim Mosul from the Islamic State. The militants\u2019 hold on the sprawling city lent the most credence to their claim to rule a fledgling nation. European Union foreign ministers are meeting today to discuss recent developments in Syria. Rebels claim to have captured the village of Dabiq, forcing the Islamic State from a stronghold. \u2022 Russia\u2019s furious response to American, British and French accusations of war crimes in Syria sent diplomatic relations into the kind of tailspin not seen for decades. Some analysts believe that President Vladimir V. Putin is raising the stakes for coming negotiations over Syria. Talks are expected to resume in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday. \u2022 France is confronting entrenched   bias, brought to a head after a Chinese migrant living in a Paris suburb was beaten to death. The death exposed the complexities of the country\u2019s volatile racial tensions, which have often been portrayed too simplistically as defined by frictions involving the large Muslim minority. Economic weakness and a rise in inequality appear to be causing a disturbing growth in ethnic nationalism in countries around the world. \u2022 A court in London is considering whether a set of archaic rules known as the royal prerogative would allow Prime Minister Theresa May to start the clock on leaving the E. U. without the kind of involvement Parliament is demanding. And The Sunday Times of London published an  \u201cBrexit\u201d column that Boris Johnson, now the foreign secretary, wrote before deciding to embrace the movement. \u201cHold your breath,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThink of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. \u201d \u2022 Silicon Valley is taking sides in the U. S. presidential race as the election on Nov. 8 approaches. Much of the sentiment being openly expressed is in opposition to Donald J. Trump, but Peter Thiel, a tech billionaire, is giving $1. 25 million to support his candidacy. Meanwhile, Republican leaders and election officials from both parties are countering claims by Mr. Trump that a conspiracy is underway between the news media and the Democratic Party to commit vast election fraud. The candidates\u2019 third and final debate is on Wednesday, with most polls heavily favoring Mrs. Clinton. \u2022 Montenegro\u2019s governing party won parliamentary elections on Sunday, according to unofficial results, but failed to secure an absolute majority. The outcome of coalition negotiations will determine whether the country continues on its Western course under the longtime prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, or turns back to Russia, its traditional ally. \u2022 A sweeping accord on banning hydrofluorocarbons reached in Kigali, Rwanda, could be even more   than the Paris climate accord. And it might not have happened without the active backing of the world\u2019s chemical companies, which are disrupting their own businesses to fight climate change. \u2022 Russia and India are moving forward with a revitalized relationship after signing billions of dollars\u2019 worth of military and energy deals at a summit meeting over the weekend. \u2022 China is in the midst of a dizzying housing bubble, but the growing use of mortgages could make this property boom particularly unstable. \u2022 E. U. trade ministers will meet on Tuesday to decide on a free trade deal with Canada, known as CETA. \u2022 Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 The Economist: \u201cEurope Is Trying to Teach Its Gender Norms to Refugees. \u201d Teaching sexual conventions is tricky, especially when there is no agreement on what those norms should be. \u2022 NPR: \u201cIn Fight Against Food Waste, Brits Find A Worthy Battlefield. \u201d A campaign encouraged food manufacturers to reduce the portion sizes of prepackaged meals. \u2022 Deep Dives: \u201cThe (Mobile) Games Women Play. \u201d A   reminder that many of the people downloading games to their smartphones are women. \u2022 In Aleppo, Syria, a drone video reveals destruction so complete that our architecture critic says it obliterates even a sense of time. \u201cAt a glance,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe video could show Berlin in 1945 or Grozny, 2000. Mass death erases all distinctions. \u201d \u2022 The death of Thailand\u2019s revered king has brought both the country and the crown prince, above, to the brink of an ascension neither appears to be ready for. His lavish lifestyle in Germany has caused great anxiety in the kingdom. \u2022 China sent two astronauts to an orbiting space lab for a   stay earlier today. Beijing\u2019s space program calls for a permanent space station by 2018, an unmanned rover to Mars in 2020 and an astronaut to the moon in 2025. \u2022 The United States has been so successful protecting wild horses in the West that   herds are overgrazing public lands. About 46, 000 horses are now held on ranches at a cost of $49 million a year. Weather and wars are responsible for many disasters these days. But two centuries ago, one was caused by an unusual culprit: beer. On Oct. 17, 1814, the London Beer Flood took the lives of eight people in a densely populated slum known as St. Giles Rookery. A series of vats exploded at a brewery, breaking through a wall. Witnesses described a wave of porter ale and debris up to 15 feet high. An \u201cimmense mass of ruins\u201d is how one newspaper described the scene. Among the victims were said to be a mother and daughter having tea. Others killed included mourners attending a wake. Decades earlier, the poverty of St. Giles inspired \u201cGin Lane\u201d by the artist William Hogarth. Perhaps because of the neighborhood\u2019s reputation, accounts of onlookers trying to scoop up the free booze became part of the tragedy\u2019s lore. A local pub pays tribute to the anniversary with special beers on tap. One that was once served was called the Beer Flood Porter. Sean Alfano contributed reporting.
