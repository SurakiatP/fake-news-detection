Well done, DSCC! \\nCorruption \\n\u201cClinton Foundation: Inurement\u201d [ Amy Sterling Cassill ]. Word of the day: \u201cThe concept of \u201cinurement\u201d is one that most nonprofit organization board members should be familiar with. In common language, \u201cinurement\u201d is a concept that means a board member, donor, or employee can\u2019t benefit excessively from the organization\u2019s funds.\u201d \\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Companies Destroyed Emails in Defiance of Court Orders\u201d [Kurt Eichenwald, Newsweek ]. Oppo garbage truck unloads\u2026. \\nWar Drums \\n\u201cHarry Reid\u2019s incendiary claim about \u2018coordination\u2019 between Donald Trump and Russia\u201d [ WaPo ]. \\nBut there is no public evidence to support Reid\u2019s claim of actual \u201ccoordination\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. And were that to be the case, it would be a scandal of epic proportions. Asked what evidence exists of such a connection, Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson cited classified briefings. \u201cThere have been classified briefings on this topic,\u201d Jentleson said. \u201cThat is all I can say.\u201d \\nNudge nudge wink wink. Say no more! Say no more! \\nThe Voters \\n\u201cSigns Grow of Another Third-Party Fizzle\u201d [ Wall Street Journal ]. \u201cBut it appears increasingly likely that no outside candidate will take a meaningful chunk of the national vote, as seemed plausible in the early summer. The combined clout of Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein fell from 17% of registered voters in July to 9% in the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. The running RealClearPolitics polling average of all four candidates is even less generous, showing Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein dropping from around 12% at various times this summer to just 7% now.\u201d \\nRealignment \\n\u201cWould Trump \u201cMake a Deal\u201d With The Left?\u201d [ Michael Tracey ]. I doubt it. And would the Left make a deal with Trump? Still, if the deal were to prevent a war\u2026 \\nThe Trail \\n\u201cFT endorsement: For all her weaknesses, Clinton is the best hope\u201d [ Financial Times ]. \\n\u201cDonald Trump has a path to victory again thanks to Florida\u201d [ WaPo ]. \u201cRemember that winning Florida isn\u2019t a luxury for Trump \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity. If Clinton wins the 18 states (plus D.C.) that every Democratic presidential nominee has carried between 1992 and 2012, she has 242 electoral votes. Add Florida\u2019s 29 to that total and Clinton is at 271 and the election is over.\u201d \\nDemocrat Email Hairball \\n\u201cHow Clinton plans to deal with Comey\u2019s October surprise\u201d [ Politico ]. \u201cProjecting confidence\u201d and \u201cgalvanizing supporters.\u201d Those are the talking points? Really? Seems a little meta. \\nStats Watch \\nPersonal Income and Outlays, September 2016: \u201cPersonal income rose a solid but slightly lower-than-expected 0.3 percent\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cInflation data are mixed to soft. \u2026 Yet the core rate, which excludes food & energy, failed to show much lift\u2026. The consumer wasn\u2019t putting September\u2019s increase in income into savings as the savings rate edged 1 tenth lower to what is a still respectable 5.7 percent.\u201d But: \u201cPersonal consumption has been the major driver of GDP since the end of the Great Recession. Last Friday\u2019s 3Q2016 GDP showed this was no longer true \u2013 and this month\u2019s consumption (last month of 3Q2016) does show some life in consumption \u2013 but the 3 month rolling average did decline \u2013 and year-over-year growth was unchanged from last month\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nChicago Purchasing Managers Index, October 2016: \u201cThe Chicago PMI has been bumpy all year and is once again for the October report, down 3.6 points at 50.6 to indicate abrupt month-to-month slowing in composite activity\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cNew orders are part of the slowing as is production. Signs of strength come from employment, which is back into the expansion column, and from prices paid.\u201d \\nDallas Fed Manufacturing Survey, October 2016: \u201cThe month\u2019s advance indications on factory conditions have shown isolated strength as does the October report from the Dallas Fed where production, though slowing, expanded for a fourth straight month\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cThe general activity index did improve but still remains negative\u2026 [C]apital expenditures, at plus 8.7, are at a two-year high. Hours worked, however, are negative.\u201d And: \u201cThis survey remained in positive territory but new orders and unfilled orders remain in contraction. This really is not that positive of a report\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cEINHORN SLAMS TESLA: \u2018Years of over-promising and under-delivering from a promotional CEO'\u201d [ Business Insider ]. \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cU.S. authorities are investigating whether middlemen in the $5 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market posted fake bids, rigged auctions and gave confidential information to others who then profited from it, according to people familiar with the situation\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. \\nHoney for the Bears: \u201cWe are forecasting marginal slowing of the economy \u2013 with the economy frozen in a condition of snails pace growth. The majority of sectors are not changing their rate of economic expansion\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \u201cOne of our litmus test recession indicators is trucking employment \u2013 which is continuing in recession territory. Consider that rail movements, industrial production, and wholesale trade are all in contraction. Prior to the Great Recession, this would have been a 100% guarantee that a recession is underway.\u201d \\nHoney for the Bears: \u201cWhere the Next Crisis Will Come From\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. \u201cNext year ends in a 7. If you\u2019re superstitious or a little loose with statistics, that makes us due for another financial crisis. The biggest one-day stock drop in Wall Street history happened in 1987. The Asian crisis was in 1997. And the worst global meltdown since the Great Depression got rolling in 2007 with the failure of mortgage lenders Northern Rock in the U.K. and New Century Financial in the U.S\u2026. Keep an eye on depressed lenders, shadow banks, and China.\u201d \\nPolitical Risk: \u201cA Little-Noticed Fact About Trade: It\u2019s No Longer Rising\u201d [ New York Times ]. \u201c[The Hanjin bankruptcy] was a moment that made literal the stagnation of globalization\u2026. The United States is no exception to the broader trend. The total value of American imports and exports fell by more than $200 billion last year. Through the first nine months of 2016, trade fell by an additional $470 billion. It is the first time since World War II that trade with other nations has declined during a period of economic growth\u2026. But there are also signs that the slowdown is becoming structural. Developed nations appear to be backing away from globalization.\u201d \\nPolitical Risk: \u201cHow do I protect myself if Trump is elected?\u201d [ Calculated Risk ]. \u201cQuite a few readers have asked me this question. My usual answer is that I expect Ms. Clinton to be elected President, and that the expansion will continue\u2026. The general rule is don\u2019t invest based on your political views. However policy does matter for investing and the economy. As an example, it was obvious to invest in oil when George W. Bush became President. And insurance companies like United Healthcare and Aetna seemed like good bets with a President Obama.\u201d So, Halliburton with Clinton? Raytheon? General Dynamics? Lockheed Martin does a lot of IT, so I guess that would be a two-fer\u2026 \\nRapture Index: Unchanged [ Rapture Ready ]. Close: 189. Record High: 189. \\nToday\u2019s Fear & Greed Index: 31 Neutral (previous close: 34, Fear) [ CNN ]. One week ago: 53 (Neutral). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed).

Well, that\u2019s appalling. And another Silicon Valley company above the law! \\n\u201cThe KKK was originally a giant, lucrative pyramid scheme\u201d [ Quartz ]. The KKK made its members pay for their own sheets from a monopoly supplier! (The Nazi Party made its members pay for their uniforms, too.) \\nCorruption \\n\u201cA $72-million apartment project. Top politicians. Unlikely donors.\u201d [ Los Angeles Times ]. \u201cNo one is registered to vote at the run-down house on 223rd Street. The living room window has been broken for months. A grit-covered pickup sits in the dirt front yard with a flat tire. Yet dozens of donations to local politicians \u2014 totaling more than $40,000 \u2014 have come from four of the people who have lived there over the last eight years.\u201d That\u2019s so dumb. If you want to launder money, you set up a family foundation. What\u2019s wrong with these people? \\n\u201cWhen CIA and NSA Workers Blow the Whistle, Congress Plays Deaf\u201d [ The Intercept ]. \\nNews of the Wired \\nOh dear: Leave it to @twitter to demonstrate in its own survey that it has no idea why people use Twitter. pic.twitter.com/AFc8njltNf \\n&mdash; Thomorrow Wong (@7homwon6) December 11, 2015 \\nPersonally, I use Twitter to curate a network of news sources and personal contacts, a task for which Facebook is miserably unsuited. It\u2019s really unfortunate that Twitter is controlled by stupid money, and that Twitter\u2019s management hates its users. Where\u2019s the damn edit button? \\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s Free Basics Is an African Dictator\u2019s Dream\u201d [ Foreign Policy ]. \u201cBut there\u2019s a dark side to Free Basics that has the potential to do more harm than good \u2014 a side that suggests that Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t get Africa after all. The app is essentially a cheap version of the internet, a fact that by itself implies that some people aren\u2019t good enough to merit the whole thing. Even worse, it\u2019s a version of the internet that gives Facebook \u2014 and by extension the corporations and governments that partner with Facebook \u2014 total control over what its users can access.\u201d \\n* * * \\nReaders, feel free to contact me with (a) links, and even better (b) sources I should curate regularly, and (c) to find out how to send me images of plants.
