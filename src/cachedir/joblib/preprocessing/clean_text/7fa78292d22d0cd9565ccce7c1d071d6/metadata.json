In the film a 16-bit Phil runs through Walford, gathering scotch eggs challenged along the way by adversaries such as Ian Beale, Dot Cotton and Sharon. \\nThe duo\u2019s previous Mitchell tributes include; \\nA Lego Eastenders set; \\na Phil action toy; \\nand conceptual art pieces\u2026 Speaking exclusively to The Poke Douggy said \u201cI start doing these photoshopped images about 15 years ago, just to stick up in the office as a joke. Over the years I noticed Phil was cropping up on the odd funny picture floating around online so I decided to go do a bunch more of my own. I met Osymyso in 2001 and used to go to all the Bastard nights he DJ\u2019d at, he was famous at the time for his \u2018Pat and Peg\u2019 song so we\u2019d both been dabbling in messing around with Eastenders, despite the fact that neither of us watch the show.

Which in itself is quite weird as we only know Eastenders from Phil\u2019s perspective.\u201d \\nfor more wonderfully warped Mitchell magic visit Utter Philth'"}, "time": 1742562521.2049503}
