If the original order were indeed a matter of pressing national security  \u2014   which the Ninth Circuit doubted  \u2014   that would reinforce the point.  According to that logic, there might only be two reasons for Trump to persist in appealing the Ninth Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court. One is that the Ninth Circuit ruling is so bad  \u2014   it makes no reference to the underlying statute, and would give even a   hijacker the right to sue to come to the U. S.  \u2014   that it deserves to be publicly rejected. However, it is not going to be persuasive to other courts, and would likely be overturned or limited to the facts of this particular case, eventually. The other reason for Trump to go to the Supreme Court is that he has said publicly said he would do so. He would lose some credibility, and perhaps suffer some embarrassment, were he to withdraw. Yet ego alone should not trump national security. But the reality is that Trump actually has no choice: he has to go to the Supreme Court, because the left would likely sue to stop any executive order he issued on the subject. Given the left\u2019s determination to oppose anything and everything he does  \u2014   even blocking new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos from visiting a school on Friday  \u2014   it is a safe bet that they would simply sue in a Ninth Circuit court again, and Trump would likely be forced to appeal to the Supreme Court in any case. So even if there is an extremely urgent national security threat, Trump might have to wait months, even to improve on the first order. And so it is ugly to say, but is likely true, that the courts may have increased the threat of terror to our country. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
