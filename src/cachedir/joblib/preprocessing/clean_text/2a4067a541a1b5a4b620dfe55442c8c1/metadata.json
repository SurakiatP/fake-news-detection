(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) \\nWith just over a week to go before Election Day , the North Carolina NAACP on Monday filed a lawsuit to stop what it describes as a Republican-led effort to snuff out the African-American vote. \\n\u201cThis is our Selma and we will not back down and allow this suppression to continue,\u201d said Rev. William Barber II, president of the organization. \\nAccording to the civil rights organization, wrongful challenges to voters\u2019 eligibility are happening in at least three counties\u2014Beaufort, Moore, and Cumberland\u2014and are disproportionately affecting African Americans. \\nThe suit (pdf) states that \u201ca small number of individuals have recently challenged the registration of approximately 4,500 voters, based exclusively on mass mailings that were returned as undeliverable.\u201d A press statement from the group says the challenges stem from \u201ca coordinated campaign led by individuals with GOP ties.\u201d Registration cancellations based on that alone is in violation of the National Voting Registration Act, the group says. \\nThe complaint, filed Monday in federal court in the Middle District of North Carolina, states, \u201cin many cases, voters purged by Defendants still reside at the addresses where they are registered to vote, or have moved within the county and remain eligible to vote there.\u201d \\nThe suit is asking for the wrongfully canceled voting registrations to be restored. \\nAmong the plaintiffs is James Edward Arthur Sr., who\u2019s lived in Beaufort County his entire life. He is African American and has been a registered voter for five years. He was among the over 130 voters in that county to have his registration cancelled based on the challenge of an undeliverable mass mailing\u2014even though he moved within the county. \\n\u201cI did not receive notice from the State or Beaufort County that my voter registration had been challenged, or that a hearing had been set to determine whether I would remain on the State\u2019s list of eligible voters,\u201d he said, referring to the procedure that election officials must follow when a challenge has been made. \\n\u201cIf I knew my right to vote was in jeopardy, I would do whatever I could to protect it. I want and plan to vote in the upcoming election, but I am concerned that since my registration has been canceled I will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted,\u201d he added. \\nAnother plaintiff is James L. Cox, also African American and another lifelong resident of Beaufort County. His voting eligibility was also part of the en masse challenges\u2014even though he currently resides at the address on his voting records. \\nThe suit\u2014filed months after a federal appeals court said the state\u2019s voter ID law was created \u201cwith discriminatory intent\u201d\u2014says that though African Americans make up less than 26 percent of the county\u2019s residents, they account for over 65 percent of the challenges. \\n\u201cThe Tar Heel state is ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts by Republicans to suppress the voice of voters,\u201d Barber added. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this emergency step to make sure not a single voters\u2019 voice is unlawfully taken away.\u201d \\nThe suit also comes as voters in the state take part in \u201cthe Souls to the Polls\u201d initiative . \\nMontica Taulmidge, a former organizer in Raleigh, told CBS it\u2019s \u201can opportunity for people to come with their congregations right after church and to vote as a community of faith.\u201d \\n\u201cOur communities of faith are super important to us so being a part of a church family,\u201d she said, \u201cand saying we are going to be civically minded, we are going to be civically active and engage in this process, is a huge deal for a lot of people.\u201d This work by Common Dreams is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike International License.\""}, "time": 1742561799.5691288}
