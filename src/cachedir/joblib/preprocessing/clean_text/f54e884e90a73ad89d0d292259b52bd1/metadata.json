The GOP plan is doomed for failure. Instead of returning the insurance market to the vigor of a free market, the government will be supporting it with tax credits  \u2014   the flip side of the ACA insurance penalty. Gianoli says the difference between Obama\u2019s health insurance plan and Ryan\u2019s proposal amounts to semantics: The difference is considering whether the bottle is half full or half empty. In other words, there really isn\u2019t any difference. Further, the stipulation of preventing the insurance industry from   premiums from initial policy inception will lead to continued gaming of the system that will not be adequately adjusted by the \u201c30% penalty\u201d for interrupted coverage. Hopefully, this plan will not be passed. Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, also observes to Breitbart News that the new proposal  \u2014   kept secret by Ryan until its release  \u2014   \u201cis 57 pages with a number of \u2018repeal this\u2019 and \u2018repeal that\u2019 clauses, but no \u2018repeal ACA. \u2019\u201d \u201cSo to paraphrase Nancy Pelosi, what is still in it?\u201d Orient asks. \u201cWas that the subject of secret meetings with special interests?\u201d Orient continues: \u201cRefundable\u201d tax credits  \u2014   for those who don\u2019t owe taxes  \u2014   are still a subsidy. It is still redistribution of wealth, with winners (those who get the subsidy) and losers (those who pay for it). And the chief winner is the \u201chealth plan. \u201d It gets money the supposed beneficiary may get nothing, or only rationed care from a narrow network. \u201cThe problem is comprehensive   payment,\u201d Orient adds. \u201cThe bill perpetuates this disastrous concept. A true   bill  \u2014   \u201cthere shall be a free market in health insurance\u201d  \u2014   would remove all federal mandates, subsidies, barriers to competition, or protections or advantages for cartels. \u201d Conservatives such as former House Freedom Caucus chairman Jim Jordan and Virginia Rep. Dave Brat also object to Ryan\u2019s proposed Obamacare repeal plan, asserting it is still Obamacare in a different form. \u201cThe bill maintains many of the federal features including a new entitlement program as well as most of the insurance regulations,\u201d Brat said. \u201cNow [they] are saying we\u2019re going to do repeal and replace but the bill does nothing of the sort. [Speaker] Paul Ryan has always said the entire rationale for this bill is to bend the cost curve down, and so far I have seen no evidence that this bill will bring the cost curve down. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628325.4409413}
