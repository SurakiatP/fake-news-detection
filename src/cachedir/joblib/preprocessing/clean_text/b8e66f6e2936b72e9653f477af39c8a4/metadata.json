[Breitbart News recently reported on the issue here.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is defending the deportation of a   convicted illegal immigrant DREAMer who applied for protection under the   \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019 DACA program. Calling it one of Trump\u2019s biggest \u201c\u201d said Krikorian today, \u201cDuring the campaign, now President Trump had said he was going to end that (DACA) on day one because it\u2019s an unconstitutional action by the president. And of course he\u2019s right, it\u2019s illegal. And they\u2019ve done nothing to it. They\u2019ve done absolutely nothing. \u201d He continued, \u201cAnd what\u2019s remarkable is not that they didn\u2019t fully follow through on that promise because politically I can see how immediately pulling work permits from hundreds of thousands of young people, each one of whom will get his own news story, could be something you want to avoid politically. But they haven\u2019t even stopped issuing DACA work permits to new people who didn\u2019t have them before. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
