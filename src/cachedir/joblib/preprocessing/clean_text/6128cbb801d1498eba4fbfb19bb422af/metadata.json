My car was never keyed before I had that sticker and never again after I removed it. What a coincidence\u2026 \\nFrom CNN : Los Angeles police are looking for the man who destroyed Donald Trump\u2019s Hollywood Walk of Fame star with a sledgehammer and a pick ax. Police tweeted Wednesday that they\u2019re seeking the public\u2019s help in identifying the vandalism suspect. \\nThe man identified himself as James Otis, an heir to the Otis family\u2019s elevator fortune , in an interview with CNN on the Walk of Fame Wednesday morning. He said he was doing it to help the 11 women who have accused Trump of sexually assaulting them, and other victims who he said could come forward in the future. \\n\u201cI had four or five family members sexually assaulted, and I\u2019m terribly upset that we have a presidential nominee who\u2019s become sort of a poster child of sexual violence,\u201d Otis said. \\nCNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment and not yet gotten a response. \\nOtis managed to remove the gold emblem from the middle of the star and damage the star itself and the area around it. The shape of the star was still recognizable after Otis had vandalized it. \\nLeron Gubler, President/CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said work to repair the star will happen immediately but the star is expected to remain covered for several days. \\nGubler said the Chamber is working with the police and intends to prosecute to the full extent of the law. \u201c When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark,\u201d Gubler said. \\nOtis said he plans to sell parts of Trump\u2019s star and donate the proceeds \u201cto the women who have been sexually assaulted by Mr. Trump.\u201d \\n\u201cI know I can sell it. I think I can get over $1 million for this star, to be distributed to these women and many others that will be going forward,\u201d he said. \\nOtis noted he previously auctioned off personal items belonging to Mahatma Gandhi, saying he \u201cdonated all the money to countries that were fighting dictatorships with non-violent strategies.\u201d That 2009 auction of Ghandi\u2019s possessions attracted news coverage at the time, including by CNN , and Gandhi\u2019s items were sold for $1.8 million. \\nOtis said he knows he might be arrested \u2014 though he doesn\u2019t want that to happen. \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742562650.4025586}
