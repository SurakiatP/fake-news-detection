Phelps has faced plenty of distractions in his 16 years as an Olympic swimmer, but nothing like this. Phelps\u2019s    son, Boomer, was in the stands to take in his first Olympic trials, and Phelps\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Nicole Johnson, was sending him photographs to commemorate the occasion. She had forgotten that Phelps\u2019s phone held his prerace playlist, a mix of songs from Eminem, Young Jeezy and a more recent addition, Eric Church. With victories in the   butterfly, the   individual medley and the   butterfly at the trials in June and July, Phelps qualified for his fifth Olympics. His vibrating phone signified the cheer, but also the challenge, of juggling his old, proven routines and a new, unpredictable life. The five weeks after the trials in Omaha were a blur of training swims and video chats. Phelps had more on his mind than the two opportunities that he will have in Rio, in the 100 butterfly and the 200 I. M. to join the track and field Olympians Al Oerter and Carl Lewis as the only Americans to win an individual event four times. To chase the record of Oerter and Lewis, Phelps had to leave behind in Arizona his main sources of inspiration, his fianc\u00e9e and their son. He had looked forward to seeing both during the designated family weekend at a training camp in San Antonio in July, but Johnson reluctantly canceled the trip after Boomer developed a fever and a nagging cough. \u201cSo now it\u2019s like I\u2019m always worried that he\u2019s sleeping right, breathing right, getting enough food, getting better,\u201d Phelps, 31, said the next day after a practice. \u201cSo it is challenging,\u201d he added. \u201cWe just left FaceTime on yesterday, even if we weren\u2019t saying anything. \u201d Johnson and Boomer made the trip to Atlanta, the site of a second training camp, a little over a week later. They were planning to rejoin Phelps in Rio de Janeiro, where they will serve as the most demonstrable proof of the transformation Phelps has undergone since his last turn as an Olympic star. \u201cHe\u2019s just very grounded, and he\u2019s living well,\u201d Bob Bowman, Phelps\u2019s longtime coach, said, adding, \u201cThe swimming is far from the only thing that he is doing. \u201d Phelps has won a record 23 Olympic medals, including 19 golds, through meticulous planning. In preparation for past Olympics, he counted his strokes in case his goggles filled with water and prohibited him from gauging the distance between walls, as they did in the   butterfly final at the Beijing Games in 2008. In September 2013, Bowman handed him a schedule for the 1, 068 days leading up to the Rio Games. In the aftermath of Phelps\u2019s arrest in 2014 for driving under the influence, his second such arrest, and his subsequent   stint in a recovery center, he set out to apply the same detailed approach to his personal life. He   contact with his father, Fred, from whom he had been estranged for several years. In February 2015, Phelps became engaged to Johnson, whom he had dated off and on since 2007, and mapped out the future: After the Olympics, the couple would get married, embark on a long and luxurious honeymoon and then start a family. The plan went awry when Johnson became pregnant in the fall. \u201cMichael was more excited than I was,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe was over the moon about having a kid. \u201d Phelps\u2019s rapprochement with his father, she said, freed him to embrace the next nonswimming chapter in his life. \u201cIt relieved him of this anger that he held on to for so many years,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt could have affected the way he looked at himself as a father. \u201d Phelps credits his personal growth, evident in his teammates\u2019 voting him a team captain for the first time in his Olympic career, to a different reconciliation  \u2014   the one he initiated with Johnson four months before his D. U. I. arrest in Baltimore in September 2014. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I love her to death. We\u2019ve been able to grow as a couple through everything we\u2019ve been through, the positive changes I\u2019ve made in my life. \u201d The two met at the ESPYs in 2007. Phelps was presenting an award with the racecar driver Danica Patrick, and Johnson was an athlete guide who harbored dreams of becoming a Formula One racing correspondent. As such, she was not thrilled to be assigned to usher Phelps around. \u201cI really wanted to escort Travis Pastrana,\u201d she said, referring to the motorsports and action sports star. To Johnson\u2019s surprise, \u201cMichael and I just completely hit it off,\u201d she said. They both had divorced parents, and they made each other laugh. Within days, they were a couple. Johnson chose not to attend the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, where Phelps won eight gold medals to surpass Mark Spitz\u2019s record for a single Games, because she did not want to distract Phelps from his singular pursuit of history. \u201cMy friends all thought I was crazy for not going,\u201d said Johnson, who was around for the madness that ensued as Phelps waded into the celebrity culture and was carried out to sea by fame\u2019s riptide. Phelps\u2019s mother, Debbie, recalled one moment of many that had illustrated how different her son\u2019s life had become. She was on the phone with Phelps, who was with Johnson at an outdoor shopping mall in Newport Beach, Calif. when it became obvious that she no longer had his full attention. As she recalled, he said: \u201cMom, I have to call you back. Kobe just pulled up. \u201d He meant the N. B. A. star Kobe Bryant, who had rolled down the tinted window of his car to greet Phelps. Johnson, a graduate of the University of Southern California, had her own experience with the crosscurrents of a public life. She entered beauty contests, enticed by the scholarship money. In November 2009, she won the Miss California U. S. A. pageant, held in Palm Springs. During her 2010 reign as Miss California, she gained a better understanding of the competing interests that were tugging at Phelps. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put your heart into things when you feel you\u2019re being pulled in so many different directions and people are taking advantage of you,\u201d she said. The two drifted apart, got back together again in 2012 and then broke up, presumably for good, before the London Olympics. Phelps, who had been unable to commit either to Johnson or to swimming, overcame his haphazard preparation to win six medals, including four golds. Then he retired, accelerating the downward spiral that Johnson said had begun after the 2008 Games. \u201cHe lived in a bubble for a long time,\u201d Johnson said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to develop as a person when you need them to perform at such a high level. He had to grow up really, really fast. \u201d Phelps returned to swimming in 2013. The following year, he was in Rio de Janeiro for a swimming clinic when he turned to his agent, Peter Carlisle, and started to say, \u201cIf I ever get a chance to get Nicole back. \u201d Before he could continue, Carlisle corrected him, saying, \u201cNo, when you get her back. \u201d A week after that conversation, Phelps sent Johnson a text that laid bare his feelings for her. \u201cAnd here we are in 2016 with a child and going to Rio,\u201d Phelps said. It was a little more complicated than that. Johnson was seriously involved with someone when she received Phelps\u2019s text. She wrote him back, saying she was dating someone and would not do anything to jeopardize the relationship. But a few weeks passed, and she could not get Phelps\u2019s words out of her mind, which she took as a sign. Johnson broke up with her boyfriend and cautiously resumed contact with Phelps. To the delight of everyone in his inner circle, they got back together and have been a team since. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really fun journey over the last couple of years,\u201d Phelps said, \u201cand a journey that I think has made me the person who I am and helped me transform to me just being me. \u201d Allison Schmitt, a   Olympian who lived with Phelps and Johnson for the past year so she could train with Bowman at Arizona State, said Phelps had met his match in Johnson, who can turn potential arguments into playful exchanges with parries like, \u201cYou can go put on your grouchy pants, Michael, because I know you had a really hard workout. \u201d After a workout at Arizona State in March, Phelps mentioned a round of golf that had been arranged for him at Whisper Rock, an exclusive   club. When Johnson had found out about his plans, he acknowledged, she had chided him for playing at a club that did not allow women. \u201cShe is perfect for him,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty confident in her own right. She didn\u2019t need or want his money. She is her own person. \u201d It is not easy being a   figure\u2019s other half, though. In April, shortly before Boomer\u2019s birth, Phelps retrieved his phone from his pocket during an interview. He called up Johnson\u2019s Instagram page and read a message a stranger had posted that began, \u201cWe want to see your abortion. \u201d It only got worse from there. \u201cPeople send her those all the time,\u201d Phelps said with a sigh. \u201cShe\u2019ll look at it, delete it and go on with her day. \u201d Phelps described himself as thankful for Johnson and their sweet life together. He knows how close he came to not knowing such joy. There is a song by Eric Church, one of his favorite artists, about a man named Michael who has a boy who is \u201cstarting to look like me. \u201d The man is a recovering alcoholic pining for the family he lost because of his addiction. That song, Phelps said, is not on his playlist.'"}, "time": 1742564492.3337133}
