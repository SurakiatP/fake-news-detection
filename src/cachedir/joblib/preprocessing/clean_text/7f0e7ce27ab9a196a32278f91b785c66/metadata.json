[While attempting to defend his CBS colleague John Dickerson, Colbert said Trump\u2019s mouth is only \u201cgood for is being Vladimir Putin\u2019s c*ck holster. \u201d  Outraged by the remark, social media users quickly made the hashtag #FireColbert a top trending topic on Twitter Tuesday. \u201cColbert\u2019s homophobic rant was disgusting and we won\u2019t tolerate this   behavior,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cLiberals ruin the careers of conservatives all the time, so the #FireColbert campaign is just giving libs a taste of their own medicine,\u201d argued another. Some called Colbert a \u201chomophobe\u201d and a \u201cbigot. \u201d #FireColbert Colbert is a  .

I NEVER tune in because of his   attitude towards @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #FireColbert,  \u2014   Rep. B. J.

Disappointing that CBS supports and empowers this. #firecolbert,  \u2014   Michael Oxley (@Truthchampion16) May 2, 2017,  I don\u2019t know that it was homophobic, but Colbert\u2019s comment was very inappropriate and not funny enough to be worth the risk  #firecolbert,  \u2014   Kimbro13 (@kimbro1360) May 2, 2017,  Some social media users called for a boycott of CBS and the network\u2019s advertisers. Time for him to go.  Total trash.  I will boycott advertisers. #FireColbert,  \u2014   hank_1972 (@Hank_1972) May 3, 2017,  Boycott CBS #FireColbert,  \u2014   Tricia Ann (@TriciaC0324) May 3, 2017,  German Lopez, a reporter for   news outlet Vox, wrote that Colbert\u2019s joke pointedly mocked gay people. \u201cIn a setting in which Colbert is deliberately trying to find a way to insult Trump, it\u2019s telling that he resorts to suggesting that Trump is engaging in sexual acts with another man. The suggestion is that the worst thing that could happen for these men is if they engaged in homosexual acts together, as if that devalues them as men or emasculates them. \u201d Colbert\u2019s      monologue also included fat jokes about President Trump. \u201cMr. President, I love your presidency. I call it \u2018Disgrace the Nation,\u2019\u201d he began. \u201cYou\u2019re not the POTUS you\u2019re the \u2018BLOTUS.\u2019 You\u2019re the glutton with the button. You\u2019re a regular \u2018Gorge Washington.\u2019 You\u2019re the \u2018 \u2019 but you\u2019re turning into a real \u2018 . \u2019\u201d \u201cSir, you attract more skinheads than free Rogaine,\u201d Colbert continued. \u201cYou have more people marching against you than cancer. You talk like a   gorilla that got hit in the head. \u201d Tonight: Stephen tells the President everything journalists, restrained by their dignity, wish they could say. #LSSC pic. twitter.   \u2014   The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) May 1, 2017,  Colbert did not address the firestorm surrounding his comments during Tuesday night\u2019s episode of The Late Show, opting instead to continue to blast Trump and Putin.  The CBS host compared the president to author Stephen King, saying Trump just \u201cmakes things up. \u201d He also aired a   clip of Trump\u2019s quotes taken out of context. Colbert\u2019s ratings have risen steadily since Inauguration Day. The CBS host has regularly beaten   rival Jimmy Fallon\u2019s Tonight Show since January, though Fallon still usually leads in the adults   demographic.
