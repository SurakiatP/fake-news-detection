Partial transcript as follows: STELTER: Let me read from your Newsweek column. Let\u2019s put part of it on screen here. You said, \u201cThe media strategy is to show Trump as an inept and craven sociopath. The Trump strategy is to show that the media people are hopeful prigs, out of touch with the nation. \u201d And you mentioned me. You said, \u201cThe media correspondent for CNN turns to the camera every Sunday morning and delivers a pious sermon about Trump\u2019s perfidiousness. \u201d I hope I pronounced that right. Tell me about that particular issue. Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong, trying to fact check the president? WOLFF: I think it\u2019s  \u2014   and I mean this with truly no disrespect, but I think you can border on being sort of quite a ridiculous figure. It\u2019s not a good look to repeatedly and   defend your own  . The media should not be the story. Every week in this religious sense, you make it the story. We are not the story. STELTER: There\u2019s room for one hour a week on CNN for this? WOLFF: Listen, I love your show. I just wish you wouldn\u2019t turn to the camera and lecture America about the virtues of the media and every one trying to attack it. The media will be fine. STELTER: The media doesn\u2019t need defending at this moment? WOLFF: The media does not need defending by the media certainly. You know, and so far, the media is  \u2014   I mean, \u201cThe New York Times\u201d front page looks like it\u2019s 1938 in Germany every day. STELTER: No, it does not. Give me a break. WOLFF: \u201cThe New Yorker\u201d as I say, has left all of its standards behind and now become, you know, an opinion vehicle constantly.
