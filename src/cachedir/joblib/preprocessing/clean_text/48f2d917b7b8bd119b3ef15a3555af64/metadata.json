[CNN, citing a White House source, reports:  Trump met with his national security team before his dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping in    Thursday, where he made the decision to pull the trigger on the biggest military action of his presidency, an administration official says. He sat through dinner with the President Xi as action was under way. Trump was briefed after dinner by Secretary of Defense James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, according to the report. The message would not have been lost on the Chinese president, whose visit was expected to include difficult discussions about the threat of North Korean ballistic missiles, as well as about China\u2019s ambitious naval expansion on artificial islands in international waters. \u201cHe does what he says   \u2026     He\u2019s sending a message to the Chinese,\u201d former General Jack Keane told Sean Hannity on Fox News. \u201cHe\u2019s telling the Chinese that, listen, the North Koreans are trying to weaponize intercontinental ballistic missiles and the rhetoric is they will use them against my country and my people. Don\u2019t push me into a corner where I have to use a military option to deal with them. That would be horrific. That would mean war on the Korean peninsula,\u201d Keane said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll get the Chinese attention for sure, as a result of that. It\u2019s not rhetoric. We\u2019ve had rhetoric for eight years, with passivity, and no action. \u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
