Of course they\u2019re all looked into and that\u2019s why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official,\u201d commented Gannon. \\nThe NC State Board Of Election released the following statement regarding the complaints: \\nThe N.C. State Board of Elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touch-screen voting machines in several counties. \\nSimilar reports have been made in recent elections, and we take them very seriously. \\nWe want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touch-screen machines accurately record voters\u2019 selections. \\nTouch-screen machines are tested thoroughly before each election. They are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy. If a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine, they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately. If needed, the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration, and the voter may be moved to a different machine. \\nAlso, each touch-screen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot. As with paper ballots, voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot. On touch-screen machines, voters also can review a real-time audit log that records all of their selections. \\n\u201cWe urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots, and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials,\u201d said Kim Westbrook Strach, executive director of the N.C. State Board of Elections.'"}, "time": 1742563852.6846502}
