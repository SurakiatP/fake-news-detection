[Anthem addressed House Republicans in a letter, saying  the \u201ctime to act is now\u201d to address the faltering individual insurance market. The health insurance giant urged Republicans to move \u201cas quickly as possible. \u201d  Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish wrote to the chairmen of the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees that the leadership\u2019s bill \u201caddresses the challenges immediately facing the individual market and will ensure more affordable health plan choices for consumers in the short term. \u201d The health insurance company supports the Ryan plan\u2019s provisions to repeal Obamacare\u2019s health insurance tax, temporarily continuing Obamacare\u2019s   subsidies, and doling out tax credits for those on the Obamacare exchanges. Anthem CEO Swedish explained, \u201cThese provisions are essential and must be finalized quickly to have the intended impact on products and prices to benefit consumers. \u201d The Blues Association asked the Republican leadership to drop a   30 percent premium surcharge on individuals who fail to maintain their health insurance throughout the entire year, warning that it could destabilize the market. Republicans added the provision to the bill. Senator Rand Paul ( ) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that the insurance companies stand to benefit from Paul Ryan\u2019s Obamacare repeal plan. Paul said that \u201cThey actually subsidize the insurance companies. Right now, insurance companies are losing money and Obamacare has this rescue thing called \u2018risk corridors\u2019 to bail out the insurance companies. Paul Ryan has got the same thing, he just calls it reinsurance and it\u2019s $100 million worth. I predict that might not even be enough. So I don\u2019t like any of it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564415.294598}
