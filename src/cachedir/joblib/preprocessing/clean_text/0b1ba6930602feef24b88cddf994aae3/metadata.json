Tim Walberg ( ) attempted to conduct a Q and A with his constituents in Jackson, Mich. [Walberg was continually interrupted when he tried to answer questions, with people shouting slogans in unison, many of those reflecting the sentiment expressed on townhallproject. com, a website sponsored by moveon. org, the Center for American Progress, and Indivisible.  The website includes instructions for sign making and provides specific questions that should be asked at the town halls, all of them opposing the policies of President Donald Trump and the   Congress. Many of the people at Walberg\u2019s town hall stood for much of the   meeting, even after they were asked to remain seated, and held up signs that read \u201c24 million,\u201d the Democrats\u2019 talking point on how many people will lose their insurance if the American Health Care Act replaces the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. People chanted \u201csingle payer,\u201d \u201ctell the truth,\u201d \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cpeople will die\u201d and asked Walberg questions promoted by the left, including questions about President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns and whether Walberg supports calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Trump\u2019s alleged ties to the Russians and the firing of James Comey as FBI director. Walberg attempted to answer all of the questions posed, even after it became clear that, as Walberg put it, \u201ccommunity organizers\u201d had infiltrated the town hall. The media covering Walberg\u2019s town hall offered a different perspective, including the Detroit Metro News, which ran a story with the headline \u201cU. S. Rep. Tim Walberg\u2019s town hall meeting in Jackson was a hot mess. \u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time a Republicans\u2019 town hall meeting did not go smoothly, and it most certainly won\u2019t be the last,\u201d the article said. \u201cAt the end of the video you can hear the crowd shouting \u201cshame\u201d over and over and many boos as well,\u201d the article said.  \u201cWalberg did tell MLive that he feels optimistic about the town halls, though, and has done one in every county he represents in 2017. \u201d VIDEO: 50:30  \u2014   58:00  \u2014   relevant chants, '"}, "time": 1742561785.7289326}
