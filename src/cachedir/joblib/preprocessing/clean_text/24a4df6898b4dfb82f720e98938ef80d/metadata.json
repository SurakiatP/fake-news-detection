There is a lot of voter fraud.\\nIn the video, NYC Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections Alan Schulkin is caught on hidden camera at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party admitting that there is widespread voter fraud in New York City.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, they should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Schulkin, who elaborated on the types of voter fraud that are taking place in New York.\\nVoter fraud has been labeled as a right-wing myth by the left, but Schulkin, a Democrat, confirmed everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst fears, going against the grain of his own party.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You know, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an ID\u00e2\u20ac\u015aLike I say, people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize, certain neighborhoods in particular they bus people around to vote,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Schulkin.\\nWhen asked about which type of neighborhoods the busing of voters takes place in, Schulkin confirmed that it was minority neighborhoods, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they get busses and they move people around.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\nSchulkin expressed concern over voter fraud and suggested that Mayor Bill de Blasio was to blame for a lot of the voter fraud taking place in New York City.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He gave out ID cards. De Blasio. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in lieu of a driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license, but you can use it for anything. But, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absurd. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\nDespite having disapproval with de Blasio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faulty ID program and widespread voter fraud, Schulkin also expressed concerns over safety in the polling locations as well as the potential for voter fraud, specifically with regards to Muslims wearing burkas.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153They detonate bombs in the public schools, which we are using. That could disrupt the whole election\u00e2\u20ac\u015aYour vote doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even count, because they can go in there with a burka and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they are a voter.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\nIt is clear after listening to a New York City Democratic Election Commissioner that the Democrats are in denial of the fraud that surrounds them. Schulkin confirms that voter ID laws are something that New York City desperately needs as a way to curb voter fraud.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742564222.3837154}
