Way to go, Asher\u2019s parents!] \\nAsher Nash may only be 15-months old, but he\u2019s got the face of an angel. \\nHis mother knew of her son\u2019s potential, despite his disability, and wanted an opportunity for him to be represented in the modeling world. \\nBut Meagan Nash ran into some issues: A talent agency wouldn\u2019t even send out Asher\u2019s photos \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t even give him a shot. Her story was picked up by a few local organizations, all fighting for Asher. \\n\u201cThe second reason, which is very near and dear to my heart, is acceptance. Without truly accepting my son and others with special needs, there can be no inclusion for them in the future,\u201d Meagan said. \\nSoon, her story went viral, and the children\u2019s line OshKosh B\u2019gosh responded, offering little Asher a spot in their 2017 campaign. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t want [OshKosh] to use him because of this fuss we are making on the Internet. I want them to use him because they value him and see how much he could contribute to their advertisement,\u201d Nash said .'"}, "time": 1742564542.1934166}
