Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment \\n\u201cBanks, intelligence, arms companies.. foreign money etc.. is all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well. \\n\u201cMedia owners and even journalists themselves.\u201d \\nRussia Today released a teaser from the interview which sees Mr Pilger asking if while Mrs Clinton was secretary of state, the State Department was approving massive arms sales, while the Clinton Foundation was also receiving money from them \\nAssange replied: \u201cUnder Hillary Clinton \u2013 and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it \u2013 the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. \\n\u201cDuring her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628429.026304}
