Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain had just left Washington on Friday evening after a tense but successful first visit with President Trump for a   flight to Ankara, Turkey, for her next awkward encounter, with the increasingly autocratic Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. By the time she had landed in Turkey, however, Mr. Trump had signed his executive order halting entrance to the United States of all Syrian refugees and of most citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Mrs. May was beginning to feel the backlash. After she termed the executive order an American issue, criticism erupted even among her own members of Parliament. She was accused of appeasement by a former British diplomat. Protesters gathered outside Downing Street on Monday night, and more than 1. 5 million signatures collected on an internet petition demanding that Mrs. May rescind her invitation for Mr. Trump to visit Queen Elizabeth II. A close relationship with any American president is regarded as crucial by allies and foes alike, but especially by intimates like Britain, Canada, Japan and Mexico. Yet like moths to the flame, the leaders of those nations are finding that they draw close at their peril. While Mrs. May is the latest prominent figure to suffer repercussions for her handling of Mr. Trump, the leaders of those other three close allies have also felt the sting of public anger soon after what seemed to be friendly telephone calls or encounters. They then find themselves facing a   situation, either openly criticizing the leader of their superpower ally or pulling their punches and risking severe criticism at home. One Western leader to escape this fate so far is the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has kept a cool distance from Mr. Trump. In a telephone call on Saturday, she reminded him of Washington\u2019s obligations under the Geneva Conventions to accept refugees fleeing war, a view underlined by her official spokesman. The danger of playing nice with Mr. Trump should come as little surprise to his country\u2019s allies. Besides campaigning on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, he has regularly argued that allies have been taking the United States for a ride, in trade, security and financial terms. While he has been cordial in public settings with the leaders of those allied nations, Mr. Trump has turned on them soon afterward. \u201cThe problem for May is that Trump doesn\u2019t value relationships. He values strength and winning,\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, the director of research at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior State Department official. \u201cIf you rush to the White House to offer a weak hand of friendship, you guarantee exploitation. \u201d While Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order was clearly not aimed at Britain, he signed it on Friday, just a few hours after Mrs. May left. \u201cYou can show up at his doorstep and hold his hand so he doesn\u2019t fall down a ramp, but that doesn\u2019t mean a few hours later when he\u2019s signing an order he thinks at all about how it affects you, your politics or your citizens,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. Particularly problematic for Mrs. May was her offering the invitation to Mr. Trump to undertake a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II this year, which was accepted. The internet petition to Parliament calling for the cancellation of the invitation says the visit \u201cwould cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen. \u201d By Monday evening in Britain, there had been more than 1. 5 million signatures, and some were enjoying themselves watching the numbers rise in real time. At a large protest outside Downing Street, people urged Mrs. May to cancel the state visit and said that while relations with Washington were important, they should be cooler toward Mr. Trump. Amber Curtis, 21, a film student who is   and   said that she worried for her family and friends in America. \u201cIt sends a bad message if he comes here after this ban,\u201d Ms. Curtis said of Mr. Trump. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I want no relationship at all, but he cannot come here under the terms of this ban. The terms need to be renegotiated. \u201d Negma Yamin, 50, a teacher of Pakistani origin, was in tears. \u201cI\u2019m so upset as a fellow Muslim I hate the persecution,\u201d she said. Mrs. May \u201cshould absolutely have no relationship with him,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate with a person like that. What is he going to do with the people? He\u2019s dividing the U. S. he\u2019s dividing the world. \u201d On Monday, Downing Street insisted that the invitation stood. But who knows how Mr. Trump will react? The Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, has had a similar experience to Mrs. May\u2019s  \u2014   twice. Last year, in the name of conciliation and dialogue, he invited Mr. Trump to Mexico, a somewhat questionable move given Mr. Trump\u2019s contempt for Mexico and his promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, raise tariffs, deport millions of Mexicans, and build (or finish) a border wall and make the southern neighbor of the United States pay for it. The visit was widely viewed in Mexico as a national humiliation. It left Mr. Trump looking stronger and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto looking weaker, especially when Mr. Trump, in an immigration policy speech in Phoenix the same day, insisted again that Mexico would pay for the wall. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto persisted after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, apparently aiming, like Mrs. May, to influence the new president and to moderate what many hoped was just hyperbolic campaign talk. But just before the two men were to meet in Washington, Mr. Trump issued executive orders calling for the wall and greatly restricting immigration. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto called off the meeting only when Mr. Trump threatened on Twitter to cancel it unless Mexico agreed to pay for the wall. Embarrassed and cornered, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto moved first, an act of defiance that provided a rare moment of public approval for the unpopular president. But given the importance of bilateral ties, he did speak to Mr. Trump the next morning for an hour, without setting a new date to meet. \u201cThis is neither a victory nor a defeat,\u201d said Fernando Dworak, an analyst in Mexico City. \u201cIt is the bell ringing in a boxing match. \u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has the distinction of being among the first to feel the sting of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. In a meeting in November in New York, Mr. Abe urged Mr. Trump, then the   not to abandon a major trade deal, the   Partnership. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s first actions in office was to abandon the deal, which many considered a victory for China, even though the pact had already been blocked in the Senate. Mr. Trump has long questioned the United States\u2019 financial and military commitment to Japan\u2019s security, and he has criticized the automaker Toyota for planning to produce cars in Mexico. An editorial in the Mainichi Shimbun, a   paper in Japan, questioned why Mr. Abe was not taking a stronger stand against Mr. Trump: \u201cIt is hard to understand why the prime minister is defending a president who destroyed the trade accord  \u2014   formed after nearly six years of arduous negotiations  \u2014   on his fourth day in office. \u201d Given the stakes, Mr. Abe has refrained from open criticism of Mr. Trump and is scheduled to meet with him in Washington early in February. The Trump effect has been felt even in Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has come under criticism for saying it is not his job to comment on the domestic policies of other countries. This after securing a pledge from the president on Sunday to honor an Obama administration agreement to accept refugees detained on the Pacific islands of Nauru and Manus. In Canada, too, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has had his Trump moments. Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular in the country, but as Mr. Trudeau\u2019s father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, once said, proximity to America \u201cis in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly or temperate the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt. \u201d So instead of provoking a fight, Mr. Trudeau moved swiftly to make contact with officials in the new administration and reshaped his cabinet to promote ministers with experience in the United States. Mr. Trump made problems right away for the Canadian leader by giving the   to the Keystone XL pipeline, putting Mr. Trudeau in an uncomfortable position between environmentalists and oil producers. If Mr. Trump goes after Canada on trade issues, as seems likely, Mr. Trudeau is expected to become significantly more vocal and critical. But to date he has avoided public criticism of the American president, a reticence that may have helped over the weekend, after Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. Canada was able to get quick clarification from the White House that the directive would not affect the movement of Canadian citizens and dual nationals into the United States. After fumbling its initial response, Britain got essentially the same clarification 15 hours later, which London hailed as a result of its special relationship with Mr. Trump. While Britain may have been influential, however, the White House was already narrowing the initial interpretations of the executive order. But not before Mrs. May was attacked for timidity in the face of outrage by her own legislators and by the opposition. Still, the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d has never been an equal one, so some degree of humiliation often goes with the territory.
