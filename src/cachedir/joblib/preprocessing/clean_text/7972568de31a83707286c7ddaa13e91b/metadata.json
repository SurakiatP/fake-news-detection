When it\u2019s a bit warmer out you can raise it in a brief moment to provide full sun and rain. To get started you need some PVC pipe and plastic, both of which can be found for cheap at most hardware stores. This design is much sturdier than you might think and is perfect for a variety of climates. Make sure to choose a spot that gets at least 6 hours of sun per day, then build it in a single afternoon to protect your plants all season long!
