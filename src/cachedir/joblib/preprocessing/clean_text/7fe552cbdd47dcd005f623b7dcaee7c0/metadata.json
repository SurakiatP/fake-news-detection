Legions of fans seemed to grant her wish on Tuesday in the hours after her death at age 60. One after another, in words both   and deeply personal, admirers paid tribute to Ms. Fisher by \u201ccoming out\u201d on Twitter with their own stories of mental illness. [ Read the obituary | Carrie Fisher and \u201cbipolar pride\u201d ] Ana Marie Cox, senior political correspondent for MTV with 1. 3 million followers on Twitter, was among the first to tweet. \u201cI really did think, \u2018What would Carrie do? \u2019\u201d Ms. Cox said in a subsequent telephone interview, as she described trying to decide how open to be about her own health. Choking back tears as she spoke, Ms. Cox continued: \u201cI really did identify her as a feminist icon, a model for being a tough smart girl. But where she really pushed the boundary of what we could talk about in polite company or impolite company was her mental illness and her openness about that. \u201d Almost immediately after her tweet, some of Ms. Cox\u2019s followers began sharing their own stories about mental illness. Jeremy Hitchcock, 34, a computer programmer from Manhattan, was seeing the new movie \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d on Friday when he heard other audience members sharing the news that Ms. Fisher had suffered a heart attack hours earlier. Mr. Hitchcock, who was so devoted to the space saga that he named his son Luke after the character Luke Skywalker, said in an interview that he was devastated by her death. After seeing Ms. Cox\u2019s tweet, he decided to do something he\u2019d never done before, something that terrified him. He announced publicly that he has bipolar disorder. The Chicago radio personality Julie DiCaro also followed Ms. Cox\u2019s lead, tweeting to her 31, 000 followers that she suffers from depression. She also began the hashtag #InHonorOfCarrie. Within a couple of hours, the hashtag had reached 182, 000 unique viewers as people began opening up about their struggles with bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, suicide  \u2014   often for the first time in such public fashion. \u201cI wanted to do something that wasn\u2019t about her being beautiful or a sex symbol,\u201d Ms. DiCaro said of Ms. Fisher, \u201cbut about her being a woman who wasn\u2019t afraid to speak out about mental illness. She became a hero to me because of who she was off the screen more than who she was on the screen. \u201d \u201cPeople who struggle with these issues often feel like they\u2019re going it alone,\u201d Ms. DiCaro continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s comforting that Carrie, or Princess Leia  \u2014   who\u2019s cooler than Princess Leia?  \u2014   was comfortable speaking publicly about her struggles. It made me feel comfortable. \u201d Ms. Fisher has said that she was first given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder at the age of 24, but that it wasn\u2019t until five years later that she actually accepted it. In time, she spoke often about her lifelong struggles with both addiction and bipolar disorder and her desire to erase the stigma of mental illness. She wrote her 1987 novel \u201cPostcards From the Edge\u201d after a stint in rehab following a   drug overdose. It was during her autobiographical   stage show, \u201cWishful Drinking,\u201d that she first posited the idea for \u201cBipolar Pride Day. \u201d Dr. Barron Lerner, a medical historian, said that while public outpourings are common after a celebrity\u2019s death, the nature of the tribute to Ms. Fisher is unusual. \u201cThe fact that they are outing their mental illness needs to be acknowledged as it remains far more stigmatized than other diseases,\u201d said Dr. Lerner, an internist at New York University Langone Medical Center and author of the book \u201cWhen Illness Goes Public. \u201d \u201cRather than just saying \u2018R. I. P. Carrie,\u2019 it is much more powerful to take a courageous step oneself to honor the memory of someone famous who also struggled with what you have,\u201d he added. Ms. Cox, who also writes the \u201cTalk\u201d column for The New York Times Magazine, said that while it felt risky to tweet about her bipolar disorder, she received a number of emails and tweets from people close to her who also cope with mental illness. And the overwhelming response on social media has convinced her it was a fitting tribute to Ms. Fisher. \u201cI think she would be floored,\u201d Ms. Cox said. \u201cI think she would be happy. It\u2019s a powerful thing. \u201d Ms. Fisher\u2019s efforts to destigmatize mental illness and addiction took new form this year as she started writing the column \u201cAdvice From the Dark Side\u201d for The Guardian. Characteristically funny and cleareyed, Ms. Fisher fielded questions from readers on bipolar disorder and dysfunctional marriages, among other topics. She ended one memorable exchange with a line that was often tweeted on Tuesday:'"}, "time": 1742628372.8554273}
