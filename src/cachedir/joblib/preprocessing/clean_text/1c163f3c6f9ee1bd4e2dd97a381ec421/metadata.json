However, Fox News reported Monday that the casino magnate had added $25 million to the millions he\u2019d already donated to Trump\u2019s campaign. The report also indicated he may give more by the end of the week. \\nHis change of heart reportedly came in the wake of FBI Director James Comey\u2019s announcement Friday that the bureau had discovered hundreds of thousands of emails that may be relevant to the bureau\u2019s ongoing investigation into Clinton\u2019s possible misuse of emails, and timing may indicate that Adelson now believes the GOP candidate has a real shot at winning the election. \\nThe donation, described to Fox News as a \u201cmassive\u201d amount of money to be spent in the final week of the campaign, was given to Future 45, a pro-Trump super PAC. Future 45\u2019s latest ad argues that the Democratic nominee cannot be trusted with the presidency as the Clinton Foundation has received millions of dollars from regimes around the world that persecute women and minorities. \\nA source told Fox News that Adelson is considering contributing up to $25 million more as the White House race enters its final few days. \\nIn May, Adelson bucked a substantial number of Republican Jews who opposed Trump \u2014 even though by that time it was clear he would be the party\u2019s presidential nominee \u2014 endorsing the pugnacious real estate magnate and reality TV star and appealing to other top Republican Jewish donors to follow suit. \\nThe New York Times reported at the time that Adelson was prepared to spend up to $100 million to elect Trump, a greater sum than he has invested in previous elections. \\nIn the following months, however, Adelson seemed to sour on Trump, instead focusing on congressional races amid fears of the Republicans losing control of Congress due to Trump\u2019s weak polling numbers and numerous controversial statements. He gave at least $40 million to super PACs focused solely on the fight for Congress, and the $10 million he initially dedicated to a pro-Trump super PAC was spent only on advertising in states with competitive Senate races. \\nTrump\u2019s campaign has been plagued by charges of anti-Semitism, racism and sexism, and the nominee has been accused of running a divisive, hate-driven campaign. \\nAdelson is a prominent donor to Jewish causes and a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
