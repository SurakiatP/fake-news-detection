This week, the accusation was repeated in a resolution of the European Parliament calling for stronger counter-measures in defense of European values against \u201cinformation warfare\u201d from Moscow. \\nThe charges \u2014 that Russian media are only an instrument of state propaganda directed at the domestic population to keep Russian citizens in line and at foreign audiences to sow dissent among Russia\u2019s neighbors and within the European Union \u2014 are taken as a matter of faith with almost no proofs adduced. Anyone who questions this \u201cgroup think\u201d is immediately labeled a \u201ctool of Putin\u201d or worse.

(Russian government photo) \\nI experienced this firsthand in March 2015 when, as one of three debaters on \u201cThe Network,\u201d a Euronews public affairs program, I objected to remarks by a fellow panelist, Chairman of the European Parliament\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee Elmar Brok, who maintained that Putin crushed all liberties and his country has no free press. \\nBased on my familiarity with the many different political lines of the Russian print media and of the patently unintimidated Kremlin-critics behind the national radio station Ekho Moskvy and television station Dozhd\u2019, I countered that, for example, Russian coverage of events in the Donbass was more multi-sided and free than coverage in the U.S. \\nBrok lashed out with the slanderous question: \u201cAnd how much did the Kremlin pay you to say that?\u201d The broadcaster then allowed this video-taped exchange to air freely. \\nI have ruminated on this exchange ever since and sought incontrovertible proof of the relative freedom of expression on Russian broadcast media. My close examination of the wildly popular political talk shows on Russian television first as a spectator and then as a participant has provided just that. \\nI have written previously about my initial experience going back six months to when I first took part in a program on the Rossiya 1/Vesti 24 state channel, Yevgeni Popov\u2019s \u201cSpecial Correspondent.\u201d I mentioned at the time the nearly permanent presence on these programs of domestic opposition figures as well as of foreigners from the U.S., Ukraine, Poland and Israel, in particular, who could be counted on to present views on the political topic of the day\u2019s discussion at sharp variance with the Kremlin line. \\nAssessing the Talk Shows \\nIn early autumn I appeared on the same presenter\u2019s new show \u201cSixty Minutes,\u201d as well on what is probably the most respected show of this genre, \u201cSunday Evening with Vladimir Soloviev,\u201d another Rossiya 1 production. Soloviev has done feature-length television interviews with Vladimir Putin and may be considered to be as close to power as people in this medium get. His personal views are probably more nationalist than the ruling United Russia party, but on his shows he, too, gives time on air to very diverse Russian and foreign views.

(RT photo) \\nIn the past month, I broadened my experience with the Russian talk show format by participating in shows on the other major state channel, Pervy Kanal (\u201cTime Will Tell\u201d) and on the country\u2019s largest commercial television channel, NTV (\u201cThe Meeting Place\u201d). This accelerated learning was facilitated by the U.S. presidential elections, which made Russian-speaking talking heads from America like myself a rather hot commodity on Russian television at least briefly. \\nIn speaking to fellow panelists during break time, in interviews with presenters, I gathered some inside information about the production side of the talk shows, including their target audiences, their technical aspects and their substantive positioning. \\nAnyone looking over Russian television programming in general quickly finds that talk shows as a format take up a very large part of broadcast time. Of course, the focus of talk shows may be highly diverse, and political talk shows were traditionally an evening phenomenon, as is the case with the Rossiya 1 shows cited above, while daytime programming more typically focuses on housewives\u2019 concerns, daydreams of romance or tips for cooking, and the like. \\nIn this sense, it was a bold move when two years ago Pervy Kanal decided to launch a daily two-hour political talk show (\u201cTime Will Tell\u201d) in mid-afternoon. As expected, the target audience proved to be stay-at-home women and viewers aged 50 and above, although it appears there are also a fair number of viewers watching the program in the work place. \\nGoing Daytime \\nThe ratings captured by this show typically are in the 20s, meaning that 20 or so percent of all television viewers in Russia at the given time are tuned to the given program, yielding an audience numbering in the millions. On Nov. 9, when I appeared on the show dedicated to analysis of the U.S. election results, the numbers spiked to 30 percent, as one might well understand given the very great interest among ordinary Russians in the outcome of the race for the U.S. presidency and the outlook for war or peace.

(Image from RT\u2019s live-streaming of the event.) \\nAs \u201cTime Will Tell\u201d presenter Artyom Sheinin explained to me, the decision to appear on daytime television called for certain production decisions differentiating the programs from the evening talk shows. Firstly, the expectation of a less sophisticated audience meant that the language of panelists should be free of political science jargon and allusion to little known names or philosophies. \\nSaid Artyom, panelists are asked to pitch their arguments as they would \u201ctalking to their kids, their mom or their lover.\u2019\u2019 On the other hand, overly calm discussion is not seen as a benefit. The presenter explains that his audience sitting at home at mid-day is in need of \u201can adrenaline shot,\u201d and the normal penchant of Russian panelists to shout down one another in a free-for-all is not discouraged in the way it is on evening programming. The evening viewer is assumed to have come home from work and is seated in his armchair before the television, wants his nerves soothed more than excited. \\nAll Russian political talk shows on the main channels are produced in the afternoon, Moscow time, and all feature on screen the caption \u201cLive On Air.\u201d However, where and when these shows are broadcast live versus rebroadcast from video tapes is another matter. \\nFor example, the Rossiya 1/Vesti programs are broadcast live to the Russian Far East, where they appear at the end of prime-time evening broadcasts. Then they are re-broadcast at local evening prime time in each of the eight other time zones of the Russian Federation lying to the west, showing last in Moscow. \\nIn this regard, two years ago when it launched \u201cTime Will Tell,\u201d Pervy Kanal took a second unparalleled risk by broadcasting live to Moscow in the afternoon. From a political standpoint, this was like a high-flying trapeze act without the benefit of a safety net. \\nIn fact all of these programs are also video-taped, and all the major channels make the tapes available for internet viewing on their websites in full or shortened versions. \\nSimilar Formats \\nJust as Russian television has often copied studio design and presentation formats from American television (I think in particular of the way the \u201cTonight Show\u201d has been replicated on major Russian channels), so they copy from one another. In fact, if you turn on any of the political talk shows I cited above, you will find rather similar studios with live audiences. A military parade on Red Square. May 9, 2016 Moscow. (Photo from: http://en.kremlin.ru) \\nIndeed, at Pervy Kanal, the producers remark jokingly that when NTV decided to launch its own afternoon talk show, \u201cThe Meeting Place,\u201d that network picked up not only the production format and studio design but also some of the production staff. The format of having male-female pairs of talk show hosts also has spread widely in the industry. \\nBut there appears to be a significant difference between these shows on the degree to which they are \u201cscripted\u201d by management upstairs, the degree to which they are free discussion. Perhaps the most scripted is this season\u2019s new entry at Rossiya 1, \u201cSixty Minutes,\u201d in which presenters Yevgeni Popov and Olga Skabeyeva are reading off teleprompters and the audience applause is aggressively prompted. On the other hand, the lead presenter on Pervy Kanal\u2019s \u201cTime Will Tell,\u201d Artyom Sheinin proudly says that he has no script handed to him, that what he says on air is what he himself prepared or is thinking at the time. \\nOne ubiquitous fact is that the panelists are not scripted and if anyone is cut off in mid-sentence it is by other panelists vying for the microphone, not by the presenter keeping the political line of discourse in check. Except in the case of senior politicians, who are given the respect their rank demands, no panelist is safe from interruptions and the audience encourages a culture of gladiators in the arena, with applause punctuating the debates. \\nOn NTV there is the additional expression of audience disapproval, but that is rare. The benefits of these ground rules go to the quick-witted as well as to the loudest voices, whatever their political complexion. \\nThe culture of these talk shows is permeated by a newsroom mentality. Some of the presenters, especially on Rossiya 1/Vesti 24, come from television journalism and have gotten their appointments as a reward for successful work in the field, especially in hazardous areas. Such was the background of talk show host Yevgeni Popov, who for years reported from Ukraine, initially during the Orange Revolution days and later during the Maidan protests. \\nThe content of each program on all channels is subject to change at the last minute as are the list of invited panelists in case of breaking news. This favors inviting panelists who are living in the Moscow area. They can be invited and disinvited at short notice. In fact, all the major political shows on the three channels I observed from inside use many of the same Russian and foreign panelists chosen from among political scientists at universities or think tanks, journalists and Duma or Federation Council members. \\nWestern Voices \\nTo be sure, not all panelists come down to the studio. A very few lucky experts are given air time from remote locations, their close-up image projected onto a wall-sized screen. \\nOne such \u201cregular\u201d on the Rossiya 1/Vesti 24 channel is Dimitri Simes, president of The Center for the National Interest in Washington, D.C. These vignette appearances get special treatment, without any interruption from other panelists and only respectful questioning from the host. \\nPanelists in greatest demand can be seen leaving one show early so as to be able to get over to another studio on a different channel when there is the rotation of panelists between advertising breaks. None is in greater demand than the American Michael Bohm, who in the dark days of worsening relations with the West provided all channels with highly fluent statements in Russian of the latest policy position of the Washington Consensus, often accompanied by Russian folk expressions. \\nThis has been especially appreciated by television producers representing the more hardline supporters of the Kremlin for whom Bohm is the kind of American the audience loves to hate, his every remark justifying demands for greater military expenditures by the Kremlin. Nonetheless, it remains true that through Bohm and a few other Westerners on these shows, the full blast of Western critiques of Kremlin policy gets prime broadcasting time in Russia. \\nThe senior politicians brought in as panelists come from all the Duma parties, not just the ruling United Russia. In the past half year, I noted in particular the frequent presence of the leader of the nationalist LDPR party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, while Gennady Zyuganov of the Communists or Sergey Mironov, leader of Just Russia, have been rare birds. \\nOn the other hand, there have been frequent appearances by the Liberals of the Yabloko party, which never made it past 1 percent of votes cast in the latest parliamentary elections, not to mention the minimum 5 percent threshold for Duma representation. \\nThe talk show programs are prepared with great professionalism. Behind each there is extensive research to find appropriate archival and/or latest visuals. The administrative chores involved in arranging logistics for the panelists chosen are also considerable. The team members I have encountered were uniformly dedicated, working crazy hours to get their job done. \\nEncouraging Strong Opinions \\nI also noted a peculiar complicity between the staff \u201chandlers\u201d and us panelists. Clearly, production staff is rewarded for finding \u201cfresh blood\u201d panelists who play out well, and they make sure that their dogs in the race are well tended with coffee, tea, and, if needed, a shot of brandy during breaks to keep their spirits high. \\nOn the Rossiya 1/Vesti 24 talk shows presenters and the panelists all are wired with headset microphones. However, on both Pervy Kanal and NTV, only the presenters are wired, while panelists are seated next to production assistants holding microphones, which they make available upon request. Indeed, the assistants act as coaches to newcomers like myself, whom they urge to speak louder, speak faster, etc. to get the greatest debate effect out of us. \\nIn conclusion, my firsthand experience with the Russian political talk show phenomenon left me with no doubt that this is bona fide journalism serving the public interest, exposing the broad Russian television audience, from everyone\u2019s parents and grandparents to business leaders and university dons, to a great many different competing and well-presented views on the major issues of the day, both domestic and international. \\nThis reality is sharply at variance with what U.S. and Western European mainstream media would have us believe about Putin\u2019s Russia. \\nGilbert Doctorow is the European Coordinator of The American Committee for East West Accord Ltd.
