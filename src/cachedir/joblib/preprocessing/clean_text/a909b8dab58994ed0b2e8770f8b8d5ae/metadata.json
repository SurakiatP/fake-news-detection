When you look back at how you\u2019re targeted, particularly your content, do you see any points that the left is making that may be valid?\u201d  \u201cAh, no, not really!\u201d replied MILO. \u201cThey\u2019re determined to smear and lie and misrepresent at every available opportunity anyone who dares to be even slightly right of center. Now they\u2019re particularly upset with me because I happen to be a conservative gay guy and have black boyfriends and God knows what else so they can\u2019t get me on racism, they can\u2019t get me on sexism, they can\u2019t get me on homophobia, they can\u2019t get me with any of their usual strategies. \u201d MILO continued, \u201cThey are left with the horrifying prospect of actually having to argue on the facts, on the merits and reasoned logic and data and they\u2019re not very good at that. Because they haven\u2019t been doing that for about thirty years and they\u2019ve forgotten how. \u201d MILO further stated, \u201cThe name calling strategies and the smear tactics simply don\u2019t work on me, they haven\u2019t worked for some time actually it\u2019s just that nobody really realised. This last election we saw exactly what the results are when the media goes after people they\u2019re and baselessly calls them names, people tend to vote almost out of spite and mischief and defiance of the politically correct establishment. They vote for somebody, even somebody like Donald Trump. \u201d \u201cI think my success is part of that too, there\u2019s sort of two MILO\u2019s really, there\u2019s the MILO that the Breitbart fans know, my readers know, the people who come to my shows know which is a sort of slightly waspish, trolly, mischievous provocateur who thinks very deeply, reads very widely, and asks people to reconsider things that they thought they knew. And then there\u2019s the version in the media which is some sort of bizarre,   white supremacist monster. Nobody recognises that picture in the same way that they didn\u2019t really recognise the picture of Donald Trump painted by CNN and The New York Times. \u201d \u201cTrust me, nobody at Breitbart cares about having a token gay on staff,\u201d said MILO discussing what it\u2019s like to be a non stereotypical conservative. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t give two tosses one way or the other, the fact is they like me because I\u2019m mischievous and fun and interesting and smart and they just want me around to start conversations. You know there\u2019s always this sort of assumption, which comes precisely from the identity politics that I\u2019m attacking, that there must be something wrong with you, there must be some sort of tokenism going on, you\u2019re somebody that was sort of acquired and broken into, you\u2019re a black guy who somehow accidentally ended up Republican or you\u2019re a gay who somehow accidentally ended up Republican and there\u2019s something wrong with you so they\u2019re using you because you\u2019re atypical of the whole, well I\u2019m not atypical of the whole. \u201d MILO continued, \u201cIn the last election in the UK, 50% of gay men said that they were voting for the conservatives, for the   party in the UK. There are vast numbers of homosexuals, not just in the Republican party but who love Donald Trump because of course they do! He\u2019s bombastic, he\u2019s fantastic and camp and all the rest of it but he\u2019s also, A) very strong on Islam and B) very strongly against political correctness. Things that are very important to gays. \u201d \u201cNow nobody covers that,\u201d said MILO. \u201cNo one really pays attention to it, you\u2019ll never really see it in the New York Times, but it is a fact, and I\u2019m very much not a token, in fact I\u2019m what   politics looks like now and because the media has been covering this so badly for so many decades you just haven\u2019t worked that out yet. This is what young conservatives look like, they\u2019re fun, mischievous, dissident, punk, trolly, good looking, fashionable. The trendy direction to go, if you want to irritate your parents, you want to get tossed out of polite society, all the things that you would have done if you were a punk in the 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s or you were looking at Madonna in the 90\u2019s who was being banned from MTV, well what do you do now? You put on one of Donald Trump\u2019s red MAGA hats. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a token, I\u2019m what the future of conservative politics has to look like,\u201d he stated.
