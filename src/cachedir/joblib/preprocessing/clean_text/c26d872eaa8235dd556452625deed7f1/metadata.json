Joe Manchin III praised President Donald Trump\u2019s reversal Tuesday of President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cClean Power Plan,\u201d which created a regulatory regime that targeted the coal mining industry and   energy plants. [\u201cSince I was governor, I have fought against unnecessary bureaucratic regulations that harm our way of life with no regard for the catastrophic economic impacts they have on West Virginians,\u201d said the only Democrat to stand and applaud during the president\u2019s joint address to Congress.  \u201cWe need to strike a balance between the environment and the economy. The Clean Power Plan never achieved that balance. Rolling back this regulation is a positive step towards preventing further job loss, increases to consumer energy bills, and more damage to our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must stop ignoring the damage these regulations caused our energy sector, our economy and our way of life in West Virginia,\u201d the senator said. The president touched on the human side of what he called the War on Coal in his remarks Tuesday after signing the executive orders. I actually, in one case, I went to a group of miners in West Virginia  \u2014   you remember, Shelly  \u2014   and I said, how about this: Why don\u2019t we get together, we\u2019ll go to another place, and you\u2019ll get another job you won\u2019t mine anymore. Do you like that idea? They said, no, we don\u2019t like that idea  \u2014   we love to mine, that\u2019s what we want to do. I said, if that\u2019s what you want to do, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. And I was very impressed. They love the job. That\u2019s what their job is. I fully understand that. I grew up in a real estate family, and until this recent little excursion into the world of politics, I could never understand anybody who would not want to be in the world of real estate. (Laughter.) Believe me. So I understand it. And we\u2019re with you 100 percent, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. Okay? The \u201cShelly\u201d Trump was calling out was  Senator Shelly Moore Capito ( ) Manchin\u2019s fellow senator from the Mountain State. Manchin said Trump gets it on coal and the effects of the last administration\u2019s approach towards coal. \u201cThis step by the administration recognizes that the Clean Power Plan went beyond the bounds of EPA\u2019s authority, instead of working against us and imposing   economic wounds like the last administration,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564047.9570544}
