Then, in 2015, Mr. Ghenie drew more attention when he commandeered the Romanian pavilion at the Venice Biennale. These days, this    artist\u2019s work has sold for as much as $9 million at auction, with a waiting list of private buyers \u201cspread out between four continents,\u201d according to Marc Glimcher, the president of Pace gallery, which represents Mr. Ghenie in New York and is giving him a solo show opening in January. Mr. Glimcher added that \u201c134 people think they\u2019re first in line. \u201d Amid a decline in the market for young artists whose prices skyrocketed just a year ago, Mr. Ghenie is enjoying nosebleed prices at auction  \u2014   but not everyone profiting from his success is entirely thrilled. \u201cThe market is overreacting,\u201d said Thaddaeus Ropac, whose gallery represents Mr. Ghenie in Paris. \u201cWe would be happy if everything were strong but not crazy. \u201d Last month, Mr. Ghenie\u2019s 2008   painting, \u201cNickelodeon\u201d  \u2014   depicting eight blurred figures in heavy overcoats  \u2014   was the top lot at Christie\u2019s in London after a bidding war pushed it to $9 million. That was more than four times its high estimate and a far cry from what the biggest Ghenies go for privately: about $650, 000. Just a few months before that, at Sotheby\u2019s in London, Mr. Ghenie\u2019s 2014 \u201cSunflowers in 1937,\u201d which pictures van Gogh\u2019s masterpiece with Nazi overtones, went for $4. 5 million  \u2014   more than five times its high estimate. Why all the fuss? \u201cHe is an extremely talented painter  \u2014   I don\u2019t think anyone can deny that,\u201d said Ali Subotnick, a curator at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, which in 2008 acquired two of Mr. Ghenie\u2019s \u201cPie Fight\u201d studies. \u201cBut it\u2019s a little absurd. \u201d Several factors have contributed to what art experts describe as a perfect storm for the Ghenie market at auction: a demand for painting  \u2014   as evidenced by the strong sales for artists like Francis Bacon, Gerhard Richter and Jenny Saville Mr. Ghenie\u2019s limited output (10 to 15 paintings a year) the scarcity of masterpieces coming up for sale an affordable price point relative to the top of the market and an eager pool of wealthy Asian buyers. \u201cPrivate buyers missed out on buying these works early on, and they\u2019re playing \u201d said Brett Gorvy, Christie\u2019s worldwide chairman for postwar and contemporary art. As they have with other artists of limited output  \u2014   like Peter Doig and Mark Tansey  \u2014   \u201cbuyers can flip\u201d Mr. Ghenie\u2019s works, Mr. Gorvy added, \u201cquickly double or triple their value as soon as they take them out of the gallery. Only a few artists have that. \u201d At its postwar and contemporary auction on Nov. 15, Christie\u2019s is selling Mr. Ghenie\u2019s 2015 painting \u201cThe Bridge\u201d  \u2014   featuring the spectral figure of a man on a bridge that recalls the Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte\u2019s \u201cLe Pont de l\u2019Europe\u201d and the Expressionist Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d  \u2014   for an estimated $1. 5 million to $2. 5 million. \u201c\u2018The Bridge\u2019 has a lot of commercial aspects  \u2014   a sense of Impressionism, Munch, Bacon, Darwin,\u201d Mr. Gorvy said, adding that it is one of several Ghenies owned by the undisclosed seller. \u201cWe said, \u2018Sell one, keep five. \u2019\u201d Mihai Nicodim said he sold \u201cThe Bridge\u201d out of his Los Angeles gallery two years ago for about $400, 000. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing it come up for sale again so quickly,\u201d Mr. Nicodim said. \u201cBut when it gets to this level, you can\u2019t blame the collectors. \u201d In response to several interview requests, Mr. Ghenie  \u2014   who divides his time between Berlin and Cluj, Romania  \u2014   said on Monday in an email, \u201cSorry for the silence, but I\u2019m so immersed in work that I can\u2019t think of anything else right now. \u201d But he is clearly aware of art market pressures. \u201cThe market is so crazy,\u201d he told The New York Times at the 2015 Biennale. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to see people make so much money so quickly. I feel I\u2019m being speculated. It\u2019s not me. It\u2019s the new art world. \u201d Born in Baia Mare, Romania, in 1977, Mr. Ghenie graduated from the University of Art and Design in Cluj in 2001. After trying to make it as an artist in Vienna and Sicily, he returned to Cluj and started the Plan B gallery with Mihai Pop in 2005. Having grown up in Nicolae Ceausescu\u2019s repressive Romania, Mr. Ghenie in his work wrestles with chapters of   European history. His \u201cPie Fight\u201d paintings, for example, draw on Hollywood slapstick even as they depict menacing Nazi figures the smeared faces might have begun to deteriorate or simply been covered in layers of cream. \u201cYou will see Ceausescu, Stalin, Hitler, Mengele,\u201d said Alex Branczik, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art, Europe, who said he was the first to put a Ghenie work in an evening sale, in 2013. That piece, \u201cDr. Mengele 2\u201d (2011) sold in London for $190, 000 after an estimate of $47, 000 to $63, 000. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to sell a portrait of Mengele,\u201d Mr. Branczik said. \u201cIn a way, we were testing the water. \u201d Mr. Ghenie\u2019s galleries  \u2014   which include Galerie Judin in Berlin and Plan B  \u2014   contend they are trying to avoid the speculative fervor that has surrounded other young artists, like Lucien Smith and Oscar Murillo, whose rapidly rising values have declined precipitously because of oversupply and high prices. \u201cWe\u2019re working on major museum shows,\u201d Mr. Ropac said, \u201cbecause this is what he needs now, not another auction record. \u201d Still, the frenzy has had an impact on private sales. Since Mr. Ghenie came to Pace five years ago, his prices have increased about 40 to 50 percent, according to Mr. Glimcher. Dealers say auction houses offer tempting guarantees: undisclosed amounts promised to sellers regardless of a sale\u2019s outcome. At the same time, some skeptics in the art world say the Ghenie craze is largely hype. \u201cEvery gallerist will tell you there\u2019s a waiting list,\u201d said one art adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to alienate clients. Galleries, for their part, say they are making sure that Mr. Ghenie attains institutional bona fides. In addition to the Hammer, Mr. Ghenie\u2019s work is so far held by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Tate. \u201cFor me, he\u2019s still at a relatively early point in his career, but he\u2019s made some extraordinarily strong, powerful paintings,\u201d said Gary Garrels, the senior curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco museum, which acquired Mr. Ghenie\u2019s painting \u201cThe Trial\u201d and a \u201cPie Fight\u201d study. \u201cI don\u2019t think every painting is successful, but he is an artist for the long haul that I intend to follow. \u201d Mr. Ghenie has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kuns, in Belgium and the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Bucharest. \u201cHe\u2019s almost like a parallel to Neo Rauch 10 years ago,\u201d Ms. Subotnick, of the Hammer Museum, said, referring to a German artist. \u201cGhenie has had a similar influence on a school of artists from Bucharest. \u201d Whether Mr. Ghenie proves to have staying power remains to be seen. \u201cFashions change quickly  \u2014   there\u2019s always going to be a backlash,\u201d Mr. Gorvy said. \u201cThen the question is, how long does it take for that artist to get back on top?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628608.5355697}
