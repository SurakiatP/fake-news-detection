He continued: \u201cUnfortunately, we have leaders that stimulate fear, and that fear causes us to do really terrible things. I think that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re talking about in the film. We have to be really careful how we talk to each other and characterize each other. The most horrible thing Trump has done is conflate the terms refugee and terrorist. It means the same thing in the U. S. now. A refugee used to be someone who you had empathy for, who you wanted to help and give refuge to. Now we\u2019re afraid of them. We have to really understand what he and this conservative movement has done and not forget we\u2019re all in this together. We can\u2019t escape each other\u2019s realities. We have to embrace each other and love each other. \u201d In The Dinner, Gere plays ambitious politician Stan Lohman, who  \u2014   together with his wife (Rebecca Hall) brother (Steve Coogan) and his brother\u2019s wife (Laura Linney)  \u2014   must decide what to do when their children are caught up in a heinous,   crime. At the panel for the film, Coogan also got in a jab at Trump when he was asked whether his character, Paul Lohman, suffers from mental illness: \u201cYes, he does have a mental illness. But compared with the president of the United States, it looks like a mild headache. \u201d The 67th annual Berlinale kicked off this week and runs until February 18. The Dinner will compete with 17 other films for the festival\u2019s top Golden Bear prize.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742562096.5677102}
