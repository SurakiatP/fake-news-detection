In fact, Mr. Spicer said, when Mr. Trump charged in a Twitter post last weekend that Mr. Obama \u201chad my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower,\u201d he was referring generally to surveillance activities during the 2016 race  \u2014   not to an actual telephone wiretap. \u201cThe president was very clear in his tweet that it was, you know, \u2018wiretapping,\u2019\u201d Mr. Spicer said, using his fingers to make a gesture suggesting quotation marks. \u201cThat spans a whole host of surveillance types of options. \u201d Mr. Spicer said there have been \u201cnumerous reports from a variety of outlets over the last couple months that seemed to indicate that there has been different types of surveillance that occurred during the 2016 election. \u201d The remarks were the first time the White House sought to explain the accusation Mr. Trump made in a series of posts on Twitter saying Mr. Obama \u201cwas tapping my phones\u201d and calling the former president a \u201cbad (or sick) guy. \u201d The explanations came as the Justice Department asked the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee, who had given a Monday deadline to produce proof of Mr. Trump\u2019s claim, for more time \u201cto determine what if any responsive documents exist. \u201d Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser, said in an interview on Sunday that Mr. Obama could have employed any number of devices other than a traditional telephone wiretap, even including a microwave oven. Ms. Conway clarified on Monday that she was not accusing the former president of snooping via a kitchen appliance, arguing that her comments had been taken out of context. \u201cI\u2019m not Inspector Gadget,\u201d she said Monday on CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign. \u201d But in an interview with a columnist for The Record of Bergen County, N. J. the day before, she said Mr. Obama\u2019s alleged spying efforts against Mr. Trump could have been far more extensive than a telephone wiretap. \u201cWhat I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other,\u201d Ms. Conway told the paper. \u201cYou can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets  \u2014   any number of ways. \u201d Surveillance can even be carried out with \u201cmicrowaves that turn into cameras,\u201d she added. \u201cWe know this is a fact of modern life. \u201d The unusual and shifting explanations from Mr. Spicer and Ms. Conway reflected the contortions that members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle have employed to explain the president\u2019s explosive accusation, which he has yet to address personally. Neither Mr. Trump nor anyone at the White House has presented any evidence for the claim, instead asking Congress to investigate it as part of its inquiry into Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election. Both the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee have requested that the Department of Justice provide evidence it may have for Mr. Trump\u2019s charge, but Mr. Spicer said on Monday that the president had not instructed the department to furnish any. He suggested that Mr. Trump had relied on multiple news reports, including in The New York Times, to make his charge. \u201cIt is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the 2016 election cycle, and now are wondering where the proof is,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. The Times and other news outlets have reported extensively on surveillance in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, particularly related to Russia\u2019s efforts to influence the election. But The Times has never reported that intelligence or   officials were themselves spying on Mr. Trump. What The Times and other news organizations have reported is that American intelligence agencies have communication intercepts that officials believe show contacts between associates of Mr. Trump and Russian officials during the campaign. Still, several   websites, including Infowars, which traffics in conspiracy theories and whose eccentric operator, Alex Jones, has interviewed Mr. Trump, have erroneously asserted that The Times and others had reported that the president was under surveillance. In a story dated March 6, Infowars cited a Jan. 19 article in The Times detailing how American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining intercepted communications as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and Trump associates. \u201cFlashback: NYT admits wiretaps used against Trump,\u201d the headline read. The story noted that The Times \u201cdidn\u2019t specifically mention that Trump himself, or Trump Tower, was bugged,\u201d but the caveat has not stopped Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters from insisting that The Times was a source for the president\u2019s tweet. Ms. Conway told CNN that in her interview, she had not been referring to the president\u2019s charges when she talked about microwave surveillance, nor could she offer any proof of his allegations. \u201cI\u2019m not in the job of having evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what investigations are for. \u201d Ms. Conway said she had never meant to imply that Mr. Obama had used a microwave to spy on Mr. Trump.'"}, "time": 1742562292.038789}
