It\u2019s a power grab & undermines democracy. Time we had the right to sack them. \\n\u201d Article 50 is an EU trap we must not fall in to. It will tie us into the EU for years. The government must appeal. People power must win.\u201d \\nLabour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cThis ruling underlines the need for the Government to bring its negotiating terms to parliament without delay. \\n\u201cLabour respects the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. \\n\u201cBut there must be transparency and accountability to parliament on the terms of Brexit . \\n\u201cLabour will be pressing the case for a Brexit that works for Britain, putting jobs, living standards and the economy first.\u201d \\nLiberal Democrats Leader Tim Farron welcomed the ruling. \\nHe said: \u201cGiven the strict two year timetable of exiting the EU once Article 50 is triggered, it is critical that the government now lay out their negotiating to Parliament, before such a vote is held.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562719.794236}
