Robert Spencer \\nThe objective of this libelous new report from the hard-Left money-making and incitement machine the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is made plain within it: \u201cBefore you book a spokesperson from an anti-Muslim extremist group or quote them in a story, research their background \u2014 detailed in this in-depth guide to 15 of the most visible anti-Muslim activists\u2014 and consider the consequences of giving them a platform.\u201d \\nThey wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat, blaming us for a supposed rise in \u201cIslamophobia.\u201d If they really want to stamp out suspicion of Islam, of course, they will move against not us, but the likes of Omar Mateen, Syed Rizwan Farook, Tashfeen Malik, Nidal Malik Hasan, Mohammed Abdulazeez, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the myriad other Muslims who commit violence in the name of Islam and justify it by reference to Islamic teachings. \\nThe SPLC doesn\u2019t do that because its objective is not really to stop \u201cIslamophobia\u201d at all, but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of \u201cIslamophobes,\u201d who can only be stopped if you write a check to the SPLC. That\u2019s what this is really all about. \\nIn constructing this illusory edifice, the SPLC labels me and fourteen others \u201canti-Muslim extremists.\u201d We are, of course, no more \u201canti-Muslim\u201d than foes of the Nazis were anti-German, but note the word \u201cextremists.\u201d That\u2019s the mainstream media and Obama administration\u2019s term of choice for jihad terrorists. In what way are we \u201cextremists\u201d? Has anyone on the SPLC\u2019s hit list (and given the SPLC\u2019s track record of inciting violence against its targets, that is exactly what it is) ever blown anything or anyone up? Beheaded anyone? Boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people? No, all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and Sharia oppression. The SPLC is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin, the non-Muslim bin Ladens and Awlakis. Until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so, however, the SPLC\u2019s libel is only that: a libel. \\nIt\u2019s also passingly ironic that the SPLC list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company, as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as \u201cIslamophobes.\u201d But their temporizing and pandering didn\u2019t work: they ended up on the Index of Prohibited Thinkers anyway, as will, ultimately, anyone who dares to note that Islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings. \\nThe \u201creport\u201d as a whole stands as an example of the Left\u2019s strange tendency to present true statements as if they were self-evidently false, without bothering to explain why. Apparently the SPLC knows its supporters and is aware that it doesn\u2019t need to bother with troublesome things like, you know, facts. \\nThe SPLC\u2019s hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as self-evidently false. For example, it says that Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch \u201caccuses immigrant-run stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps.\u201d This is a case that Corcoran makes with evidence \u2013 evidence that the SPLC doesn\u2019t bother to try disproving. It says that Steven Emerson of the Investigative Project on Terrorism \u201chas claimed that the Obama administration \u2018extensively collaborates\u2019 with the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d That he actually has done so doesn\u2019t seem to bother them. As Andrew C. McCarthy has noted , \u201cBarack Obama has spent his presidency cultivating Islamists, particularly from the international Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates in the United States.\u201d The SPLC also hits Emerison for having \u201casserted that Europe is riddled with \u2018no-go zones.\u2019\u201d Regarding \u201cno-go zones,\u201d here are some news articles from just the past few weeks: \\nGermany: Police \u201csick\u201d of citizens\u2019 no-go zone fears \\nThe SPLC excoriates Brigitte Gabriel of ACT for America for saying that any \u201cpracticing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah \u2026 who goes to mosque and prays every Friday, who prays five times a day \u2014 this practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen of the United States.\u201d Yet it says nothing, of course, about the many teachings of the Qur\u2019an that contradict American Constitutional principles: the denial of the freedom of speech, the death penalty for apostasy, the devaluation of women, and more. How to reconcile these teachings with U.S. citizenship, the SPLC did not bother to explain. \\nThe SPLC quotes David Horowitz saying: \u201cThere are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists \u2014 and that includes people in the Democratic Party, even those who are anti-terrorist.\u201d Here again, no refutation is offered \u2013 yet the Left\u2019s dalliance with Palestinian jihad groups and overall anti-Americanism make it impossible to dismiss Horowitz\u2019s assertion. \\nFrank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, we\u2019re told, \u201cis gripped by paranoid fantasies about Muslims destroying the West from within.\u201d The SPLC doesn\u2019t bother to mention the Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America , the captured Muslim Brotherhood internal document that explained that Brotherhood members \u201cmust understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and \u2018sabotaging\u2019 its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God\u2019s religion is made victorious over all other religions.\u201d \\nIn attacking Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, the SPLC descended to outright fabrications. Notes Geller : \u201cTheir claim that I insist that Obama is the \u2018love child\u2019 of Malcolm X is patently untrue. The SPLC also states that I \u2018have spoken to a neo-fascist group in Germany,\u2019 when in fact I have never even been to Germany.\u201d It characterizes former FBI agent John Guandolo\u2019s claim that CIA director John Brennan was a convert to Islam as an \u201coutlandish accusation,\u201d when in fact \u201ca U.S. asset assigned overseas with Brennan in Saudi Arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that Brennan was indeed the target of a Saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion. Brennan has also stated publicly that he visited Mecca, which is impossible for a non-Muslim to do unless he is a special guest of the Saudi King.\u201d \\nEven more strangely, the SPLC targets Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman who grew up as a Muslim in Somalia, suffered genital mutilated at the hands of Muslims, is under death threats from Muslims, and lives in exile from her homeland because of Muslims. Instead of trying to discredit her, the SPLC should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against Sharia oppression. But the SPLC has other priorities. \\nOf me, the SPLC concedes that I am a \u201creal intellectual\u201d but complains that I am \u201centirely self-taught in the study of Islam.\u201d An odd objection. One cannot be both \u201cself-taught\u201d and a \u201creal intellectual\u201d? In any case, it\u2019s false: I am indeed mostly self-taught in the study of Islam, and make no secret of or apologies for it; every day\u2019s headlines proves me correct. Nonetheless, the fact is that I did first read the Qur\u2019an and began studying Islam in earnest while at the University of North Carolina. My claims, says the SPLC, are \u201cprovably false,\u201d but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true, without any attempt to refute them. \\nIt even says that I have \u201creferred to Barack Obama as \u2018the first Muslim president.\u2019\u201d This one epitomizes the dishonesty of the SPLC. The quote comes from an article I wrote in 2007 discussing how Obama was not a Muslim, stating that his obvious affinity for Islam and the Muslim world could make him into \u201cour first Muslim president\u201d the way Bill Clinton was called \u201cour first black president.\u201d After eight years of Obama, I\u2019d say I was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion. \\nThe SPLC, finally, hits me for having \u201ceven suggested that the media may be getting money to depict Muslims in a positive light.\u201d \\nThe facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the SPLC: George Soros funded a report on \u201cIslamophobia\u201d on Twitter and gave $200,000 to the Center for American Progress for a defamatory report on alleged \u201cIslamophobes.\u201d He also spent $600,000 for favorable coverage of the Muslim migrant inundation, bought favorable coverage of the Iran deal , and bought \u201cIslamophobia\u201d propaganda after the San Bernardino jihad massacre. \\nBut what need does the SPLC have of facts? It knows its readers won\u2019t check up on the veracity of its claims, but will accept them at face value, since the SPLC is of the camp of the saints, the enlightened and tolerant Left. Those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the SPLC feels bound to respect.\""}, "time": 1742562384.3643715}
