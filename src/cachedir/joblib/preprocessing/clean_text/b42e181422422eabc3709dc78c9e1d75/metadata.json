As Channel NewsAsia reports, the holiday is routinely denounced as an example of \u201cWestern decadence\u201d by \u201cIslamic clerics and some pious Muslims. \u201d[Muslim   students in the city of Surabaya staged a protest and chanted \u201cSay no to Valentine,\u201d while the National Muslim Youth Association \u201curged females to avoid using emoticons and an excessive amount of fragrance in a  \u2019s Day message. \u201d  \u201cThere is a certain pride about this positive action carried out by the students,\u201d beamed the headmaster of the school in Surabaya, which Channel NewsAsia describes as \u201crun by an Islamic organization. \u201d Just in case any students do not take positive action on their initiative, the UK Express reports that government officials in Surabaya, which is the   city in the country, ordered the city\u2019s schools to ban Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations. The provinces of West Java and Aceh have taken similar measures. According to Reuters, authorities outright banned Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations in some parts of Indonesia and Pakistan because it \u201cencouraged casual sex and ran counter to cultural norms. \u201d In the city of Makassar, police raided stores and pulled condoms off the shelves, having received reports that \u201cthe minimarts were selling condoms in an unregulated way. \u201d Deutsche Welle quotes the mayor of Makassar complaining that condoms were sold \u201cas if they were candy,\u201d and warned shop owners they could lose their licenses if they sell condoms to unmarried people. There is an alarming political undercurrent to this  \u2019s Day push by Indonesian Muslims, as Deutsche Welle explains: Valentine\u2019s Day this year falls a day before the capital, Jakarta, goes to the polls to elect a new governor in a vote widely viewed as a test of the country\u2019s religious tolerance. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnically Chinese Christian, is running for   in a campaign marked by accusations that he insulted the Koran. The claims have led to hardline Islamic protests and a trial for blasphemy. The case has been criticized as unfair and politically motivated. Purnama is going up against two Muslim candidates, and his opponents have repeatedly urged people not to vote for him because he is not a Muslim. Tens of thousands of conservative Muslims have in recent weeks rallied at mosques against Purnama, whose lead in the polls has slipped. If he loses the vote because he is not a Muslim and is jailed for blasphemy, analysts say, it would be a blow to the country\u2019s reputation as a pluralist democracy. Reuters notes that while the highest Islamic clerical council in Indonesia declared a fatwa (religious injunction) against Valentine\u2019s Day in 2012 because they deemed the holiday \u201ccontradictory to Muslim culture and teachings,\u201d Indonesian law protects religious diversity, and the holiday is still big business in cities like Jakarta. The Islamic Republic of Pakistan, by contrast, banned public Valentine\u2019s celebrations in Islamabad and instructed media not to promote the holiday, to the dismay of florists.'"}, "time": 1742628436.393272}
