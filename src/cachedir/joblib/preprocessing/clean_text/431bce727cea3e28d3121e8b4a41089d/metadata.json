It was a   January day. The snow was so high that her daughter had to come over to take the dog out. \u201cI have lung cancer and it\u2019s the dead of winter,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d Help came in the form of a heating subsidy: money from the federal government, delivered by the Highland County Community Action Organization, a small nonprofit in rural southern Ohio, where Ms. Feltner lives. Now, that program is on the chopping block. It is one of many cuts in President Trump\u2019s new budget proposal that would inflict the deepest pain on the most vulnerable Americans  \u2014   a great number of whom voted for him. \u201cI understand what he\u2019s trying to do, but I think he\u2019s just not stopping to think that there are people caught in the middle he is really going to hurt,\u201d said Ms. Feltner, 57, who was a nurse for 25 years and voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cHe needs to make some concessions for that. I was a productive citizen. Don\u2019t make me feel worthless now. \u201d As news of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget begins to sink in across the country, Americans are trying to parse what the changes to the government\u2019s spending plan might mean for them. It is only a proposal, an opening bid in what is likely to be a protracted public argument over national priorities. But it is important because it signals what the new president is thinking, his wish list for the size and shape of government. In two days of interviews with beneficiaries of programs at risk in 11 states, many people said they did not see themselves reflected in Mr. Trump\u2019s vision for the government. And some felt surprise at what has been left out. Ms. Feltner said that without the heating subsidy she would probably have to move in with her daughter and two teenage grandchildren. \u201cI\u2019d still like to have a little dignity left, and not have to move in with someone else,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to be the one packing up the food in the food pantry for people,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m the one in line. \u201d Another proposed cut would defund the Appalachian Regional Commission, which was founded in 1965 to strengthen economic growth in a   swath of the country. Of the 420 counties in the commission\u2019s footprint, 399 voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cI hate to see him cut us,\u201d said Chris Farley, 32, of Delbarton, W. Va. who was laid off from his job operating a drill at a surface coal mine in 2015 and is now in a jobs and education program partially funded by the commission. Mr. Farley worked in coal for 11 years. When he was 18, his father, a miner, helped get him a job driving a truck that carried rocks. The pay was good: He was making $20 an hour when he was laid off  \u2014   a punch he did not see coming. The only work he found afterward paid minimum wage. With a wife and    daughter, he struggled to pay the bills. \u201cI tried everywhere to get a job,\u201d he said. \u201cI mowed lawns. I cut weeds. I hauled trash. \u201d Last year, his mother texted him about a job in farming through a local nonprofit called the Coalfield Development Corporation, which is partially supported by the Appalachian Regional Commission. It pays him $11. 50 an hour for 33 hours a week growing cucumbers and raising chickens and pigs. It also pays for him to attend community college six hours a week where he working toward an associate degree. His grade point average is 4. 0. \u201cI never dreamed I\u2019d be going back to school,\u201d he said. \u201cI love it. It\u2019s amazing. College is totally different than high school. Back then I was young and I didn\u2019t care. \u201d The farm had its first full year last year: a good cucumber harvest, a lot of eggs sold. Mr. Farley was reminded of eating beans and tomatoes at his grandparents\u2019 farm as a boy. \u201cI blew up the mountains,\u201d he said, \u201cand now I\u2019m reclaiming the mountains. \u201d Another worker in the Coalfield Development jobs program is Tracy Spaulding, 19, the son of a longtime miner. When his father was laid off after nearly 30 years, he made ends meet by buying an industrial saw and cutting lumber. The younger Mr. Spaulding has skipped the mine altogether: He works in a wood shop making things like TV stands, cabinets and headboards for beds. In November, Mr. Spaulding cast his first vote for president. He chose Mr. Trump, something he tries not to talk about with his friends who didn\u2019t. \u201cThey get really sore about it,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I like Donald Trump. That\u2019s just how I feel, I like him. A lot of people don\u2019t and I understand that. \u201d When asked what he thought about the proposed cut to the commission, he thought for a bit. \u201cHe ain\u2019t pulled nothing on us yet,\u201d he said. He thought more. \u201cI believe I\u2019d be a little bit mad about it if he made that cut and I lost my job and schooling, you know? But things happen. People get laid off every day. I\u2019ll make it one way or another. \u201d In Staten Island, N. Y. Raymond DeNozzo, 53, a carpenter who has lived in Sutton, W. Va. for 28 years, was back home visiting his father on Friday. He, too, voted for Mr. Trump. He believes his adopted state\u2019s coal industry was decimated under President Barack Obama. He supports increased spending on veterans and on the military, and, at least in theory, cuts to some social programs. He thinks that welfare discourages people from working, for instance. \u201cWe need to teach our children to work and go out and be independent,\u201d he said. But his wife is a schoolteacher, their health insurance is through her job, and Mr. DeNozzo worries about the potential cuts to schools that could result from Mr. Trump\u2019s budget. School consolidations are already overburdening teachers, he said. And they can also harm students, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern,\u201d Mr. DeNozzo said. \u201cWill he keep the little schools open?\u201d Some of the programs in Mr. Trump\u2019s sights are like unloved stepchildren, with alphabet soup acronyms unfamiliar to anyone except fiercely dedicated  . But they can have outsize effects on people\u2019s lives. Money from a Community Development Block Grant helped pay to remodel Shantell Swenson\u2019s bathroom and kitchen in Salt Lake City, making it easier for her to use a wheelchair in her home and allowing her to cook on a stove for the first time. There have been other benefits, too. \u201cNow instead of spitting my toothpaste into a cup I can roll under the sink,\u201d said Ms. Swenson, 33, who has cerebral palsy. Tired of lifting her legs into and out of a standard bathtub and begging landlords to change it, she scraped together her savings to buy a small house last May. The bathroom was finished in September, and the kitchen is on track for April. She calls the work life changing. \u201cI would be old and gray and partially retired before I could have been able to afford this on my own,\u201d she said. Ms. Swenson said she did not \u201crage toward\u201d Mr. Trump \u201clike some people I know. \u201d But when she heard about his proposed budget cuts, she said, she was \u201cboiling with anger. \u201d One of those proposed cuts would kill the Legal Service Corporation, which funds 133 civil legal aid programs in the 50 states at a cost of $385 million. That funding stream makes up 40 percent of the budget for Legal Aid Services of Oklahoma, whose lawyers saved Paula and Joe Frye from losing their   home. The Fryes, who live in Warner, had missed a $14 tax payment four years earlier. They learned that their property had been put up for auction only when a man pulled up to their home and Mr. Frye asked him what he wanted. \u201cThe man said he wanted to look at the land for sale,\u201d said Mrs. Frye, a retired turkey hatchery worker. They were unable to resolve the unpaid bill themselves, but the land was sold at a county auction for $5, 000. The Fryes could not match that, or afford a lawyer. Only when they turned to Legal Aid did a lawyer there discover a technical flaw in the county\u2019s handling of the tax arrears and the Fryes got their home back. \u201cThis is all we had,\u201d Mrs. Frye said. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Legal Aid, I guess we\u2019d just live in our car. \u201d The Fryes, who did not vote, said they were reserving judgment on Mr. Trump. Some things are probably beyond the president\u2019s control, Mr. Frye said. Mrs. Frye said they would be watching. \u201cI guess until we see exactly what he does do, then I\u2019ll know if I like him or wish he had lost,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742628476.2989054}
