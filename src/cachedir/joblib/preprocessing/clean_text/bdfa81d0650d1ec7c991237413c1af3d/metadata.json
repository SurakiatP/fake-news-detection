How many Russians did he kill?  \u2014   Bruins73 (@Bruins1973) January 9, 2017,  @RussianEmbassy This is grossly offensive. Pepe is a recognised symbol of Neo Nazis . U people are in the gutter with them obviously,  \u2014   Spartacus (@Livlonanprsper) January 9, 2017,  Popular internet meme Pepe the Frog was added to the   League\u2019s hate symbol database in September, where it currently sits alongside the swastika, Nazi SS lightning bolts, and various Ku Klux Klan imagery. Hillary Clinton, George Stephanopoulos, NBC\u2019s Katy Tur, and Heat Street have also branded the cartoon frog a symbol for white supremacy, seemingly basing their claims on a Daily Beast article that interviewed two notorious trolls, Jared Taylor Swift and Paul Town. During the interview, Swift and Town attempted to link the meme to white supremacy, with Swift boasting that he had managed to trick the media on his   Twitter account afterwards. Following this interview, Pepe has been used as a scapegoat by the left to brand   conservatives, libertarians, and even Donald Trump, Jr. as racist. The branding has prompted many users to fight back against the Clinton Campaign, mainstream media, and ADL\u2019s ruling that Pepe is an offensive icon, branding it a \u201cwar on memes. \u201d Several popular YouTubers have also defended the cartoon frog, while   iPhone game Build the Wall: The Game was rejected from Apple\u2019s App Store for featuring Pepe, and eventually even his silhouette.
