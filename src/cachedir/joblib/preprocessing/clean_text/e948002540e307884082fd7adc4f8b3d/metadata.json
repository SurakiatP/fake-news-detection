Hollywood\u2019s first awards show of the year was  \u2014   like so much in today\u2019s headlines  \u2014   brought to you by Donald J. Trump. Even before Meryl Streep took the   to the   he loomed over Jimmy Fallon\u2019s monologue. The last time Mr. Trump appeared with Mr. Fallon on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d the host tousled his hair during a softball interview. Mr. Trump\u2019s subsequent election was both an affirmation of celebrity\u2019s power and a repudiation of most celebrities\u2019 politics. So beyond \u201cMoonlight\u201d versus \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d a big question hanging over the awards was how, or whether, Mr. Fallon would address the Republican elephant in the room. The night began with exactly the kind of bit you\u2019d figure Mr. Fallon would start with: a   parody of scenes from the musical mash note to Los Angeles, \u201cLa La Land. \u201d It was a fitting choice, if not an especially hilarious one, at the most escapist of awards shows. Music and   comedy are the strength of Mr. Fallon\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show. \u201d (He brought his bandleader, Questlove, along as D. J.) And just as \u201cLa La Land\u201d is a bubbly tribute to performers and their dreams, Mr. Fallon\u2019s talk show is a stage for celebrities  \u2014   and politicians  \u2014   to perform their likability. In his monologue, Mr. Fallon seemed determined to show that his   hand had claws. He said the awards results were \u201ctabulated by the firm of Ernst  Young and Putin. \u201d Referencing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans who wondered what would have happened if King Joffrey  \u2014   the show\u2019s sadistic, petty    \u2014   had lived, he said, \u201cin 12 days we\u2019re going to find out. \u201d His   jokes felt out of character the rest were ordinary. (He did show off his talent for impressions, doing a Chris Rock that reminded us how sharp Mr. Rock had been at the Oscars.) The most memorable part may have been at the beginning, when Mr. Fallon\u2019s Teleprompter went out. He vamped for a bit, and after the commercial break he returned with a joke  \u2014   likening his mishap to Mariah Carey\u2019s singing disaster on New Year\u2019s Eve  \u2014   that it seemed half of Twitter had already made at that point. Mr. Fallon handled his technical   much better than the diva. But he didn\u2019t make much of it either, and that summed up the night. He wasn\u2019t bad this year just didn\u2019t seem like his cultural moment. You had to wonder what last year\u2019s host, the vitriolic Ricky Gervais, might have done, or Mr. Fallon\u2019s other predecessors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who made acerbic jokes in good fun. Entertainers can make an audience forget the turbulent times with a tour de force performance. (See Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig, who did a brilliant bit about their first visits to the movies going horribly wrong  \u2014   someone might want to call their agents and lock them down to host next year.) They can make art out of troubles. (See many of the night\u2019s winners, such as the     \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson. \u201d) Or they can lay it between the lines. Hugh Laurie seemed to compare his character in \u201cThe Night Manager\u201d to the  : \u201cI accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere. \u201d It was Meryl Streep, receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award, who repudiated Mr. Trump, for a \u201cperformance\u201d during the campaign in which he mocked a disabled reporter. \u201cIt sank its hooks in my heart,\u201d she said. Call me biased (that reporter is a colleague at The Times) but it was as passionate and devastating as any scripted clip played that night. Ms. Streep also said that without Hollywood\u2019s performers from around the world, \u201cyou\u2019ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts. \u201d Did that persuade anyone for whom those   are entertainment? There is a school of thought that it does nobody good for celebrities to deliver political diatribes, coded or not, on a night that celebrates the fortune of the fortunate. But their work says something, like it or not. The 2016 election was, among other things, a cultural argument: overtly and subtextually, it was in part about how comfortable America was with change, diversity and inclusion  \u2014   about whether there was some   homogeneous \u201cgreatness\u201d that America had lost. The awards, and the acceptances, often served as an answer, a message that the social gears have not totally been thrown in reverse. \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a film about a young black man growing up gay, won best drama. FX\u2019s \u201cAtlanta,\u201d set in the   scene of the Georgia city, won best TV comedy or musical, and its creator, Donald Glover (who also won best actor in a comedy or musical) thanked \u201call the black folks in Atlanta. \u201d And Tracee Ellis Ross, star of \u201c \u201d (whose title Mr. Trump once railed against on Twitter) dedicated her award to women of color: \u201cI want you to know that I see you. We see you. \u201d Sometimes, this Globescast said, art is an escape. Sometimes it\u2019s a call to arms. And sometimes seeing, and being seen, is a statement in itself.'"}, "time": 1742562143.5868416}
