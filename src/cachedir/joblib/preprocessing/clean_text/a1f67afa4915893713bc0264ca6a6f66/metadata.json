The uncertainty surrounding the Rio Olympics has become more pronounced in tennis, with four top players in the last five days having announced that they will skip the Games, now only two and a half weeks away. Two men,   Milos Raonic and   Tomas Berdych, and two women,   Simona Halep and   Karolina Pliskova, expressed concerns over Zika, which had been largely minimized by players who answered questions about the virus during the French Open and Wimbledon. \u201cI concluded that the risks are too high for my career and for my health, especially as a woman,\u201d Halep said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cFamily is much too important for me and I can\u2019t risk not being able to have one of my own after my career in tennis is over. \u201d Berdych, who reached the Wimbledon semifinals, said previous tournaments had kept him too busy to think about the Olympics until recently. \u201cObviously, I\u2019ve known about the virus a long time, since when it all started,\u201d Berdych said Tuesday at the Citi Open in Washington. \u201cBut of course the season was going on\u201d Berdych, who said he hoped to compete in the 2020 Olympics, said that he could not justify the risks that he saw to his life after tennis. \u201cI\u2019m going to play two, three, four years, and then the rest of my life will be another 60 years, something like that,\u201d Berdych said. \u201cIf something happens that makes that not the way you want it, because of one week or one tournament, you might have a sad life. No, I don\u2019t think so I don\u2019t want to take that risk, even if the risks are possibly small or whatever. \u201d Although several male players removed themselves from Olympic consideration because of a desire to focus on ATP events  \u2014   which Raonic also cited in an interview after his initial announcement  \u2014   only one player had mentioned Zika before late last week as a reason for not traveling to Brazil. That was Alexandr Dolgopolov, who pulled out in June and cited Zika as a particular concern giving his existing medical concerns, which include Gilbert\u2019s syndrome, a liver condition. Concerns over Zika had been discussed privately, however. Horia Tecau, who had planned to play mixed doubles with Halep, a fellow Romanian, before she announced her withdrawal, said that Halep had expressed concerns weeks ago about the virus. Tecau, who still hopes to qualify for the mixed doubles event with a   partner, said the withdrawals by Halep and other athletes had disappointed him, especially given what he sees as the relatively low risk posed by the virus. \u201cWhen I keep hearing about this virus, if you sit down and think about all the stuff that we go through during the year, with everything that\u2019s happening in the world now, there\u2019s a lot of risk everywhere,\u201d Tecau said. \u201cI think this Zika virus is a very small percentage out of that risk. It\u2019s not a solid enough reason. \u201d As an example of overblown concern, Tecau pointed to a report from the United States State Department about concerns regarding the Olympic Games that the ATP had distributed to players. While 20 of the 33 pages focused on crime and security, less than one page focused on Zika. Other players are also confident. Denis Kudla, an American, expressed faith in organizers\u2019 preparedness and said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot more than that to not go to the Olympics. \u201d Brazilians, such as Bruno Soares, a doubles champion at this year\u2019s Australian Open, have been outspoken about assuaging the panic over the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world or something like this,\u201d Soares said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a little bit of my duty just to try to inform people. \u201d Soares has cited the   ATP event in Rio de Janeiro in February, when mosquitoes are in season, as reason for his fellow players to be at ease. \u201cSo many guys came to me in the last swing in Europe saying, \u2018What\u2019s the real situation over there? \u2019\u201d Soares said. \u201cInternational media is just making such a huge thing out of it. I\u2019m saying: \u2018Listen, guys: I\u2019m from Brazil. We played the Rio event in the summer, when the mosquitoes are way worse  \u2014   they don\u2019t really grow during winter  \u2014   and there was zero cases.\u2019 If you go to Brazil, there\u2019s no worry about that. People are just living normal lives. \u201d Others remain concerned over the mixed signals. Samantha Stosur, an Australian, said she was \u201cabsolutely, 100 percent going\u201d but admitted that she had more questions about these Games than about the three previous Olympics she had attended. Eugenie Bouchard, a Canadian, remains undecided. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone knows enough about it to really give a good opinion on whether, as athletes, we should go or not,\u201d Bouchard said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if the health of my future babies is worth it. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to decide in my head. \u201d Sloane Stephens of the United States said that she had received conflicting medical advice but that she planned to go  \u2014   and to pack the mosquito nets she had already bought. \u201cOne doctor I talked to said, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t go, because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u2019 and yada, yada,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cAnd some other doctors are like, \u2018You know, if this is your dream and you want to go play the Olympics? Go. \u2019\u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564300.8644958}
