Many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the (conservative) right as opposed to the (liberal) left. \\nThe logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the Democrats win over Republican voters in the general elections \u2014 voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate. \\nThe GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, is perceived by many as more leftist than rightist, which would give Clinton the edge among conservative voters. \\nWho knew the placement or direction of an arrow could spell victory or defeat for an American presidential candidate?
