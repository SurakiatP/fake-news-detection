( Karen Murphy / (CC BY-ND 2.0) ) \\nIn an essay in The New York Times Magazine, columnist Maureen Dowd sheds light on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\u2019s climb through New York\u2019s high society. \\n\u201cWe are in the final days of the first presidential contest between two New Yorkers in 72 years,\u201d Dowd writes. \u201cOn election night, the party and the wake will both be held in Manhattan. Hillary will hold hers at the Javits Convention Center, with its literal glass ceiling\u201d. \\nDowd examines the Clintons\u2019 move from Washington D.C. to New York after Bill left the presidency: \\nWith Hillary\u2019s Senate bid underway, the Clintons held out their tin cup. They had been fund-raising in the city nonstop since 1990, but the asks intensified as they started their foundation in 2001 and rubbed shoulders with all the new wealth on Wall Street, which was driven by hedge funds and technology funds. With book deals and lucrative speeches and Bill\u2019s role as an adviser to Ronald Burkle\u2019s private-equity firm, Yucaipa, the Clintons worked their way out of the debt accrued by legal bills from a cascade of federal investigations to earn an estimated $230 million in the next 15 years. \\nAs the Clintons fashioned a new life in New York, Trump was transforming himself as well \u2014 from a risk-taking developer facing bankruptcy to a low-risk licenser of his name for other people\u2019s projects, from a brazen builder to a gilded reality-TV star on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d He had come out of Queens, a pushy New York kid with family money but no social tools to climb the society ladder. \u201cEven stuck out on Avenue Z, his head was always in Manhattan,\u201d says Wayne Barrett, author of the biography \u201cTrump: The Greatest Show on Earth.\u201d Gwenda Blair, author of \u201cThe Trumps,\u201d says Trump, resplendent in the \u201970s in his three-piece burgundy suit with matching shoes and matching limo, recalled \u201cthis strapping lad from the provinces who comes to the city, like a figure out of Balzac\u2019s \u2018Lost Illusions.\u2019?\u201d \\nThe New York society scene was set by the Rockefellers and the Astors with a tradition of civility, philanthropy and the arts at its heart. Even those who make money the rough way \u2014 especially them \u2014 adopt this genteel facade. Michael Bloomberg is the quintessential emblem of this model and Donald Trump is the quintessential raspberry to it. One top New York foundation official who requested anonymity \u2014 many people will only speak anonymously about the Trumps and the Clintons, because both clans are known to be vindictive \u2014 notes that \u201cin the community of plutocrats and superachievers who come to New York, Donald Trump is seen as persona non grata. He\u2019s not a civic leader.\u201d New York, this person says, is a place where private-equity C.E.O.s like Henry Kravis and Stephen Schwarzman see themselves making commitments to the public good. Their status doesn\u2019t come only from being in charge of powerful corporations. \u201cIt also comes from some attachment to a hospital or university or cultural center. Trump was never part of that ecosystem.\u201d When the tightfisted Trump hosts a charity event for veterans or a charity golf tournament, it is dismissed as something to polish the Trump brand. Trump has turned off many people in the worlds of real estate, banking and law with his strong-arming, fee-shaving or stiffing, bankruptcies and litigiousness. \u201cMost real estate guys won\u2019t go near him,\u201d a leading New York financial executive says. \u201cYou lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.\u201d \\nTrump thumps his chest about money, acting as if he\u2019s Bloomberg-wealthy, while the Clintons pretend they have less than they do. Trump wants to belong, to get more legitimacy by elbowing his way into the power crowd, while the Clintons passed that threshold of belonging after two terms in the White House. A top media mogul dismisses all three as outsiders: \u201cNo one here thinks of the Clintons as New Yorkers, and Donald is a bridge-and-tunnel person. He\u2019s always been a poseur in New York.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628446.3276062}
