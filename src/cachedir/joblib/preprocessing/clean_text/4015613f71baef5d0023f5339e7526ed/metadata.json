The Orange County medical examiner\u2019s office released its report of Mr. Mateen\u2019s autopsy on Friday, the same day local officials began to distribute their   findings about the victims of the attack, during which Mr. Mateen pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State. The 32 death reports released on Friday were the first time that the authorities so publicly cataloged and detailed the injuries of the dead. The medical examiner\u2019s office said in a statement that it had begun notifying family members on Thursday that the reports would be released under the state\u2019s public records law. The office said it expected to publish all of its assessments by Wednesday night. Officials reported their findings about the deaths of 28 men, including Mr. Mateen, and four women. The youngest victim whose autopsy was published was an    woman the oldest was a    man. Most of those who were killed died of multiple gunshot wounds, the autopsies showed. The placing of the shots varied some people were wounded in the head, while others were shot in the torso, and still others were struck in their arms, neck or lower extremities. It was not clear on Friday whether anyone besides Mr. Mateen had been killed from police gunfire. Citing the continuing inquiry, a spokeswoman for the Orlando police referred a request for comment to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which did not respond to a message. But Orlando\u2019s police chief, John Mina, left open the possibility in June, when he said, \u201cThat\u2019s part of the investigation, but here\u2019s what I will tell you: Those killings are on the suspect. \u201d The reports had a certain uniformity  \u2014   each person\u2019s death, for instance, was declared a homicide  \u2014   but the scores of pages also carried small hints about individual lives. One man had been wearing two beaded bracelets when he was gunned down, while another young woman had worn \u201can elaborate yellow metal necklace\u201d to Pulse. Another person had carried his photo identification from the Y. M. C. A. Mr. Mateen, his autopsy report noted, had been dressed in tan pants, a holster attached to a black belt. He was struck by gunfire in several places, including the chest, the abdomen and the foot. Mr. Mateen died after a protracted standoff with the police, who feared that he would set off explosives, as he had threatened to do. Once the authorities gained access to the nightclub with the aid of an armored vehicle, officials traded gunfire with Mr. Mateen, who was 29. The medical examiner\u2019s office said Friday that it would not discuss individual cases. But in an interview in June, the county\u2019s chief medical examiner, Dr. Joshua D. Stephany, said it appeared that all of the victims had died quickly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear anyone suffered,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone went down where they were. I don\u2019t think anyone had prolonged suffering. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562758.0302694}
