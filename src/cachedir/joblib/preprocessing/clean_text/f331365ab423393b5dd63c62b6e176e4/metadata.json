In fact, the likelihood of no-holds-barred nuclear war is, at best, negligible \u2014 but the odds of unhindered conventional warfare have increased markedly over the past week.\\nScroll Down For Video Below A senior NATO diplomat, who spoke with Reuters under condition of anonymity and cited \u2018Western intelligence,\u2019 gave the startling assessment Wednesday that Russia is \u201cdeploying all of the Northern fleet and much of the Baltic fleet in the largest surface deployment since the end of the Cold War.\\n\u201cThis is not a friendly port call. In two weeks, we will see a crescendo of air attacks on Aleppo as part of Russia\u2019s strategy to declare victory there.\u201d\\nIndeed, Russian ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad eagerly accepted President Vladimir Putin\u2019s military assistance in its chaotic and complex conflict, which largely involves U.S.-created and Saudi Arabia-funded Islamic State militants; U.S.-trained and armed \u2018moderate rebel\u2019 terrorists; Syrian government forces; and the altogether controversial Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition. Considering the decimation taking place, that assistance is absolutely justifiable.\\nOf course, that farcically simplified explanation requires the contextualization of an intricate web of extenuating circumstances \u2014 nearly any one of which could spark a powderkeg.\\nRussian military endeavors in Syria have already earned a vow by the U.S. to defend itself \u2014 and by logical extension, that would include whichever rebel groups it considers \u2018moderate\u2019 enough not to deserve being targeted. With Russia planning an all-in offensive, some analysts have warned, the Pentagon could facilely decide to undertake direct \u2018defensive\u2019 measures.\\nAt the heart of the U.S.\u2019 multi-fronted proxy war with Russia sits a highly-propagandized, baseless narrative of \u201cRussian aggression\u201d \u2014 a claim thoroughly saturating American political rhetoric to shift both focus and blame from the true substantive aggressor the world over: the United States.\\nSave for scanty disagreement from Western-centric analysts, this American aggression \u2014 marked by an obstinate quest for dominance and control \u2014 has us all perilously hurtling for needless war on a global scale.\\nAnd needless, if not highly suspect, aptly characterizes the U.S. recent destruction of several strategic radar sites inside Yemen following dubious claims the U.S.S. Mason had come under missile attack by Iran-allied Shi\u2019a Houthi rebels. Although American politicians and corporate media swiftly proffered those claims as steel truth \u2014 even amid a nascent investigation by the Pentagon \u2014 the Department of Defense\u2019s own preliminary statement cast doubt about veracity.\\n\u201cThe initial thoughts is that this [attack] was aimed at them,\u201d DoD spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis statedshortly after the purported incident last Tuesday.\\nNonetheless, the belligerent move by the U.S. spurred Iran to deploy an entire fleet of military vessels to the same Gulf of Aden waters from whence the response attack had been launched.\\nNow, despite the abrupt and official military entree into the Yemeni war, Reuters reported, the \u201cPentagon declined to say on Monday whether the USS Mason destroyer was targeted by multiple inbound missiles fired from Yemen on Saturday, as initially thought, saying a review was under way to determine what happened.\u201d\\nBut the U.S. propaganda machine truly hit a fever pitch today, thanks to an altogether shady exclusive report courtesy of Reuters \u2014 amplifying an altogether unproven claim Iran has been directly supplying Houthi rebels with missiles, arms, and \u2018cash.\u2019\\nIn fact an unsurprisingly unnamed and unverifiable \u201csenior U.S. administration official\u201d delivered an accusation of potentially staggering consequence, telling Reuters:\\n\u201cWe have been concerned about the recent flow of weapons from Iran into Yemen and have conveyed those concerns to those who maintain relations with the Houthis, including the Omani government.\u201d\\nOman, of course, flatly denies such allegations.\\n\u201cThere is no truth to this,\u201d Omani Foreign Minister Yousef bin Alwi told Saudi newspaper Okaz in an interview last week. \u201cNo weapons have crossed our border and we are ready to clarify any suspicions if they arise.\u201d\\nIn fact, though Reuters cites several anonymous diplomats and officials, the accusation Iran has been supplying anything directly to the Houthis has yet to be unassailably proven \u2014 and such reports do little more than proffer a narrative suitable not only to maintain new U.S. military endeavors in Yemen, but to recklessly provoke a proxy Iranian conflict.\\nSuch psychological operations are, of course, not unusual for the United States \u2014 and extend to a statement given by President Barack Obama on Tuesday concerning Russia.\\nIn a blatant attempt to discredit Donald Trump for a supposed fondness for Putin, Obama, as usual, invoked the Russian aggression narrative \u2014 however, this spiel came complete with a pointedly significant re-characterization about the Russian military.\\n\u201cWe think that Russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours and has to be a part of the solution on the world stage rather than part of the problem,\u201d the president explained, surreptitiously upgrading the Cold War foe\u2019s capabilities than its previous status as mere \u201cregional power\u201d in umpteen previous statements.\\nThis not-at-all-minor point most does effectively two things: grows in less cagey American minds the palpability and thus legitimacy of a Russian threat, and renews Cold War propaganda pitting two global superpowers as mortal enemies \u2014 ostensibly setting up a pre-justification to act in even pre-emptive self-defense anywhere on the planet this proxy war plays out.\\nAdditionally, in a matter of weeks, disfavor over U.S.\u2019 actions has cemented military and other alliances between a quickly mounting number of former, longstanding American allies and other traditional Western foes \u2014 the vast majority of which align with Russia.\\nAfter a subtly significant geopolitical snub during a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to negotiate a ceasefire in Syria, which infuriated Saudi Arabia, Egypt fomented a friendly military relationship with UNSC presiding body, Russia.\\n\u201c[F]or the first time,\u201d beginning October 15, Reuters reported, \u201cjoint drills between Egyptian and Russian paratrooper units\u201d began in Egypt, and will continue through the 26th. Further, the growing rift with Saudi Arabia indicated Egypt might have been weighing options for a different ally for some time. Reuters wrote:\\n\u201cA halt to shipments of Saudi fuel to Egypt under a $23 billion aid deal shows that a rift between the Arab world\u2019s richest country and its most populous may be deeper than previously thought, which could leave Egypt desperate for a new sponsor.\u201d\\nEgypt hasn\u2019t been alone in jumping ship \u2014 and the Middle East isn\u2019t the sole locus of conflict.\\nDuring a four-day visit at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping this week \u2014 amid deteriorating relations with the United States \u2014 Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte asserted it is \u201conly China that can help us.\u201d\\nThis massive shift in alignment could have highly consequent repercussions in the territorial dispute over the South China Sea \u2014 another conflict in which the U.S. has embroiled itself in several proxy wars, including Russian-backed China.\\nIn fact, although the Philippines had been at the center of that quarrel, unnamed Chinese officials prior to the ongoing meeting announced China would \u201cconsider giving Filipino fishermen conditional access to disputed waters in the South China Sea after the presidents of the two countries meet in Beijing this week.\u201d\\nNow, following through on intimations the Philippines would cleave from the West, Duterte just made a historic and stunning announcement today, to an auditorium in Beijing packed with over 200 Chinese and Philippine business people, including Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli:\\n\u201cIn this venue, your honours, in this venue, I announce my separation from the United States. Both in military, not maybe social, but economics also. America has lost.\u201d\\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019ve realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to [President Vladimir] Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world \u2014 China, Philippines and Russia. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d\\nAs another geostrategic and commercial waterway of international importance, the South China Sea\u2019s role in the U.S. proxy war is second only to the Red Sea and access to it \u2014 but the presence of American naval vessels in both those waters and neighboring East China Sea has been deemed an aggressive threat by China and its strengthening ally Russia, as well as North Korea.\\nJoint naval and military drills conducted by the U.S. and ally South Korea and the planned installation of the U.S.\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile system along the latter\u2019s borders inflamed tensions with North Korea \u2014 who has been testing ballistic missiles for months, much to the consternation of the two nations and ally, Japan.\\nOn Wednesday, in response to this perceived aggression, North Korea issued a severe admonishment to the two countries that even \u201cminor signs of aggression\u201d would greenlight Pyongyang to flatten Seoul in a defensive first-strike nuclear attack.\\n\u201cIt has been too long a time since our revolutionary armed forces switched to a principle of pre-emptive strike in the conduct of war, in response to the aggressive war provocations of our enemies,\u201dPyongyang stated, as cited by UPI, ominously adding a \u201cruthless pre-emptive strike is to be applied even in the face of minor signs of aggression.\u201d\\nNot known for backing down from delicate situations, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declared its intent to deploy THAAD \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d after meeting with South Korean officials in Washington, and told the press:\\n\u201cLet me be clear. Any attack on the United States or its allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons will be met with an effective and overwhelming response. \u201cWe do not, and we will not, accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.\u201d\\nLeaving nothing open to misinterpretation, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter clarified in a separate press statement that, in defense of Seoul, the United States guaranteed \u201cfull spectrum\u201d use of its response capabilities \u2014 meaning nuclear missiles are anything but off the table.\\nShortly afterward, according to NBC News, \u201cU.S. Strategic Command said it had detected what it believed to be a failed missile launch near the northwestern North Korean city of Kusong.\u201d Director of the North Korean Foreign Ministry\u2019s Institute for American Studies, Lee Yong Pil, told NBC News Pyongyang will absolutely strike first if Pyongyang perceives it necessary, saying,\\n\u201cThe U.S. has nuclear weapons off our coast, targeting our country, our capital and our dear leader, Kim Jong Un. We will not step back as long as there\u2019s a nuclear threat to us from the United States.\u201d South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, saying its allies would employ \u201call tools in the toolkit\u201d for defense, asserted,\\n\u201cWhat is most important is to continuously demonstrate our capability and deterrence with our commitment and actions so that Pyongyang can feel the panic under their skins.\u201d North Korea might be known for blustery rhetoric it refuses to back with significant action \u2014 but continued provocation by the United States might elicit a response far more detrimental than words.\\n'"}, "time": 1742562160.2950501}
