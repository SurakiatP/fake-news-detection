Justices across the ideological spectrum said the laws under which he had been convicted gave prosecutors too much power to say that routine political favors amounted to corruption. \u201cIt puts at risk behavior that is common,\u201d said Justice Stephen G. Breyer. \u201cThat is a recipe for giving the Justice Department and prosecutors enormous power over elected officials. \u201d Mr. McDonnell, a Republican, was prosecuted on charges that he had used his office to help a businessman, Jonnie R. Williams Sr. who had showered the governor and his wife with luxury products, loans and vacations worth more than $175, 000. The gifts themselves were legal, and the question in the case was whether they were part of a corrupt bargain in which Mr. McDonnell reciprocated by using the power of his office to help Mr. Williams. Mr. McDonnell, who attended the argument on Wednesday, arranged meetings for and attended events with his benefactor. But Mr. Williams, whose company made a diet supplement, did not have any real success in obtaining support for his product from the state. A jury found that Mr. McDonnell\u2019s actions amounted to corruption, and a federal appeals court upheld the conviction. Noel J. Francisco, a lawyer for Mr. McDonnell, said his client should not have been convicted, as he did not \u201cmake a government decision or urge someone else to do so. \u201d The corruption laws, he added, were \u201cnot meant to be comprehensive codes of ethical conduct. \u201d Michael R. Dreeben, a lawyer for the federal government, said such a narrow definition was \u201ca recipe for corruption\u201d that would \u201csend a terrible message to citizens. \u201d Justice Breyer responded that \u201cI\u2019m not in the business of sending messages in a case like this,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m in the business of trying to figure out the structure of the government. \u201d Justice Anthony M. Kennedy also sounded frustrated, saying that \u201cthe government has given us no workable standard\u201d to distinguish political favors from criminal acts. Mr. Dreeben took a hard line, saying that a vacation or an expensive lunch traded for arranging a meeting could be sufficient. But he added that it was hard to prove criminal intent. Justice Kennedy reacted with sarcasm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell the senators, the officials with the lunches, that \u2018don\u2019t worry, the jury has to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019\u201d he said. Some justices said that even the standard urged by Mr. McDonnell\u2019s lawyer converted too much ordinary conduct into a crime. \u201cThe word \u2018influence\u2019 is too broad,\u201d Justice Breyer said, \u201cbecause every day of the week politicians write on behalf of constituents letters to different parts of the government, saying, \u2018Will you please look at the case of Mrs.    who was evicted last week? \u2019\u201d Justice Kennedy said he would limit the definition of unlawful corruption to the \u201cexercise of governmental power to require citizens to do or not to do something, or to shape the law that governs their conduct. \u201d Asking another official to have a meeting with a donor, he suggested, was not enough. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who seemed sympathetic to the government, probed the implications of such a standard, asking Mr. Francisco whether it would be lawful to charge $1, 000 for a meeting. \u201cIf there\u2019s no indicia that you\u2019re actually trying to influence the outcome, and it really is just a meeting, yes,\u201d Mr. Francisco said. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said it might matter who was arranging the meeting. \u201cIf it\u2019s the president who calls and says, \u2018I want you to look at this matter for my constituent,\u2019 that might exercise considerably more influence,\u201d he said. But Chief Justice Roberts was considerably more animated and skeptical in questioning Mr. Dreeben, the government\u2019s lawyer. The chief justice quoted from a supporting brief filed by several former White House counsels of both parties who warned that if the decision were upheld, it would \u201ccripple the ability of elected officials to fulfill their role in our representative democracy. \u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s extraordinary that those people agree on anything,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said. Last year, the Supreme Court allowed Mr. McDonnell to stay out of prison while the court considered whether to hear his case, McDonnell v. United States, No.  . That unusual order was a powerful hint that the court might be inclined to rule in his favor. In their Supreme Court briefs, Mr. McDonnell\u2019s lawyers relied on the Citizens United decision in 2010, in which the Supreme Court said that \u201cingratiation and access\u201d were \u201cnot corruption. \u201d That year, the court ruled in favor of a former Enron executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, saying that a federal anticorruption law governing \u201chonest services\u201d applied only to bribes and kickbacks. On Wednesday, Chief Justice Roberts noted that three members of the court  \u2014   Justices Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, who died in February  \u2014   would have gone further in the Skilling case and ruled that the law was unconstitutionally vague. \u201cMaybe the experience we\u2019ve had here,\u201d the chief justice said, \u201cand the difficulty of coming up with clear enough instructions suggests that the caution the court showed at that point\u201d  \u2014   in construing the law narrowly rather than striking it down  \u2014   \u201cwas  . \u201d Mr. Francisco, who had a good day, stumbled near the end of his presentation, referring to Justice Ginsburg as \u201cJustice O\u2019Connor. \u201d \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened in quite some time,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court, retired in 2006. Mr. Dreeben\u2019s outing was rockier, but it ended in a tribute from Chief Justice Roberts, who congratulated him on presenting his 100th Supreme Court argument, a rare achievement. While a majority of the justices seemed inclined to vote in Mr. McDonnell\u2019s favor, it was not clear that they would agree on a rationale. As Justice Breyer put it, Mr. McDonnell\u2019s case presented \u201cas knotty and complicated and difficult and basic a problem as I can think of. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562800.9286542}
