In a visit to the Central Intelligence Agency intended to showcase his support for the intelligence community, Mr. Trump ignored his own repeated public statements criticizing the intelligence community, a group he compared to Nazis just over a week ago. He also called journalists \u201camong the most dishonest human beings on earth,\u201d and he said that up to 1. 5 million people had attended his inauguration, a claim that photographs disproved. Later, at the White House, he dispatched Sean Spicer, the press secretary, to the briefing room in the West Wing, where Mr. Spicer scolded reporters and made a series of false statements. He said news organizations had deliberately misstated the size of the crowd at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday in an attempt to sow divisions at a time when Mr. Trump was trying to unify the country, warning that the new administration would hold them to account. The statements from the new president and his spokesman came as hundreds of thousands of people protested against Mr. Trump, a crowd that appeared to dwarf the one that gathered the day before when he was sworn in. It was a striking display of invective and grievance at the dawn of a presidency, usually a time when the White House works to set a tone of national unity and to build confidence in a new leader. Instead, the president and his team appeared embattled and defensive, signaling that the pugnacious style Mr. Trump employed as a candidate will persist now that he has ascended to the nation\u2019s highest office. Saturday was supposed to be a day for Mr. Trump to mend fences with the intelligence community, with an appearance at the C. I. A. \u2019s headquarters in Langley, Va. While he was lavish in his praise, the president focused in his   speech on his complaints about news coverage of his criticism of the nation\u2019s spy agencies, and meandered to other topics, including the crowd size at his inauguration, his level of political support, his mental age and his intellectual heft. \u201cI just want to let you know, I am so behind you,\u201d Mr. Trump told more than 300 employees assembled in the lobby for his remarks. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has questioned the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia meddled in the United States election on his behalf. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about Mr. Trump, he accused the intelligence community of allowing the leak and wrote on Twitter, \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d On Saturday, he said journalists were responsible for any suggestion that he was not fully supportive of intelligence agencies\u2019 work. \u201cI have a running war with the media,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey are among the most dishonest human beings on earth, and they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. \u201d \u201cThe reason you\u2019re the No. 1 stop is, it is exactly the opposite,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cI love you, I respect you, there\u2019s nobody I respect more. \u201d Mr. Trump also took issue with news reports about the number of people who attended his inauguration, complaining that the news media used photographs of \u201can empty field\u201d to make it seem as if his inauguration did not draw many people. \u201cWe caught them in a beauty,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the news media, \u201cand I think they\u2019re going to pay a big price. \u201d Mr. Spicer said that Mr. Trump had drawn \u201cthe largest audience to ever witness an inauguration,\u201d a statement that photographs clearly show to be false. Mr. Spicer said photographs of the inaugural ceremonies were deliberately framed \u201cto minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall,\u201d although he provided no proof of either assertion. Photographs of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009 and of Mr. Trump\u2019s plainly showed that the crowd on Friday was significantly smaller, but Mr. Spicer attributed that disparity to new white ground coverings he said had caused empty areas to stand out and to security measures that had blocked people from entering the Mall. \u201cThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. He also admonished a journalist for erroneously reporting on Friday that Mr. Trump had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office, calling the mistake  \u2014   which was corrected quickly  \u2014   \u201cegregious. \u201d And he incorrectly claimed that ridership on Washington\u2019s subway system was higher than on Inauguration Day in 2013. In reality, there were 782, 000 riders that year, compared with 571, 000 riders this year, according to figures from the   transit authority. Mr. Spicer also said that security measures had been extended farther down the National Mall this year, preventing \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d from viewing the ceremony. But the Secret Service said the measures were largely unchanged this year, and there were few reports of long lines or delays. Commentary about the size of his inauguration crowd made Mr. Trump increasingly angry on Friday, according to several people familiar with his thinking. On Saturday, Mr. Trump told his advisers that he wanted to push back hard on \u201cdishonest media\u201d coverage  \u2014   mostly referring to a Twitter post from a New York Times reporter showing    frames of Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd and Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009. But most of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers urged him to focus on the responsibilities of his office during his first full day as president. However, in his remarks at the C. I. A. he wandered off topic several times, at various points telling the crowd he felt no older than 39 (he is 70) reassuring anyone who questioned his intelligence by saying, \u201cI\u2019m, like, a smart person\u201d and musing out loud about how many intelligence workers backed his candidacy. \u201cProbably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same wavelength, folks. \u201d But most of his remarks were devoted to attacking the news media. And Mr. Spicer picked up the theme later in the day in the White House briefing room. But his appearance, according to the people familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking, went too far, in the president\u2019s opinion. Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance at the C. I. A. touched off a fierce reaction from some current and former intelligence officials. Nick Shapiro, who served as chief of staff to John O. Brennan, who resigned Friday as the C. I. A. director, said Mr. Brennan \u201cis deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump\u2019s despicable display of   in front of C. I. A. \u2019s Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. \u201cBrennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself,\u201d Mr. Shapiro added. \u201cI was heartened that the president gave a speech at C. I. A. ,\u201d said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the C. I. A. and the National Security Agency. \u201cIt would have been even better if more of it had been about C. I. A. \u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that he had had high hopes for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit as a step to begin healing the relationship between the president and the intelligence community, but that Mr. Trump\u2019s meandering speech had dashed them. \u201cWhile standing in front of the stars representing C. I. A. personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country  \u2014   hallowed ground  \u2014   Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cHe will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world. \u201d Mr. Trump said nothing during the visit about how he had mocked the C. I. A. and other intelligence agencies as \u201cthe same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. \u201d He did not mention his apparent willingness to believe Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who is widely detested at the C. I. A. over his own intelligence agencies. He also did not say whether he would start receiving the daily intelligence briefs that are prepared for the president. The agency sees the president as its main audience, and his dismissal of the need for daily briefings from the intelligence community has raised concerns about morale among people who believe their work will not be respected at the White House. Since the election, hopes at the C. I. A. that the new administration would bring an infusion of energy and ideas have given way to trepidation about what Mr. Trump and his loyalists have planned. But the nomination of Mike Pompeo, a former Army infantry officer who is well versed in issues facing the intelligence community, to lead the C. I. A. has been received positively at the agency. \u201cHe has left the strong impression that he doesn\u2019t trust the intelligence community and that he doesn\u2019t have tremendous regard for their work,\u201d Mark M. Lowenthal, a retired C. I. A. analyst, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe obvious thing to do is to counter that by saying, \u2018I value you. I look forward to working with you. \u2019\u201d \u201cHe called them Nazis,\u201d Mr. Lowenthal added, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of the intelligence community. Mr. Lowenthal said Saturday\u2019s visit should have been \u201ca stroking expedition. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563400.9126387}
