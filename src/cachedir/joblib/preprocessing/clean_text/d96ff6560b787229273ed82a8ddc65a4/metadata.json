[In the article, entitled \u201cScraping by on six figures? Tech workers feel poor in Silicon Valley\u2019s wealth bubble,\u201d the employee complained that his   salary was \u201cpretty bad\u201d for the area.  \u201cI didn\u2019t become a software engineer to be trying to make ends meet,\u201d proclaimed the employee. \u201cFamilies are priced out of the market. \u201d \u201cThe biggest cost is his $3, 000 rent  \u2014   which he said was \u2018ultra cheap\u2019 for the area  \u2014   for a   house in San Francisco, where he lives with his wife and two kids,\u201d reported The Guardian sympathetically. \u201cHe\u2019d like a slightly bigger property, but finds himself competing with groups of twentysomethings happy to share accommodation while paying up to $2, 000 for a single room. \u201d \u201cThe prohibitive costs have displaced teachers, city workers, firefighters and other members of the middle class, not to mention   residents,\u201d they continued. \u201cNow techies, many of whom are among the highest 1% of earners, are complaining that they, too, are being priced out. \u201d The Guardian also covered other Silicon Valley employees in the piece who were earning \u201cbetween $100, 000 and $700, 000 a year\u201d but still allegedly had trouble \u201cmaking ends meet. \u201d \u201cOne Apple employee was recently living in a Santa Cruz garage, using a compost bucket as a toilet. Another tech worker, enrolled in a coding bootcamp, described how he lived with 12 other engineers in a   apartment rented via Airbnb,\u201d The Guardian reported. \u201cIt was $1, 100 for a fucking bunk bed and five people in the same room. One guy was living in a closet, paying $1, 400 for a \u2018private room,\u2019\u201d one man complained, while a female employee added, \u201cWe make over $1m between us, but we can\u2019t afford a house  \u2026     This is part of where the American dream is not working out here. \u201d Several San Francisco residents mocked the employees for their complaints. \u201cScraping by in the Bay Area on a   salary sure must be difficult!\u201d joked San Francisco Chronicle reporter Lizzie Johnson.
