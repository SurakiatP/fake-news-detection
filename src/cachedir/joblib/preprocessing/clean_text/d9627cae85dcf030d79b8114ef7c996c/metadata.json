Go to any fashion show and you can see it: a woman or man in a colorful, kooky   swarmed by photographers jostling for the best shot and calling, \u201cLook over here!\u201d and, \u201cWho are you wearing?\u201d  \u2014   lemmings in the land of the   . But Bill Cunningham, who began it all, was never among them. Since his death on Saturday, many of the memorials and the hagiographies that have poured out over the internet have dubbed Bill (I can\u2019t call him Mr. Cunningham, as I\u2019ve known him, and been squeezed up next to him on fashion show benches, for too long) the father of street style, and rightly so. Still, a more accurate way to think of him might be as someone who applied the tenets of visual journalism to fashion. He began his career as a reporter, after all, and his photographs were simply another expression of the same discipline: They weren\u2019t filtered, airbrushed or staged. He was among the first to recognize the value of observing what people wore in their everyday life, and to understand that it was a reflection of identity and culture, a means of communication used by all, and thus a crucial historical record. Before there was Scott Schuman, a. k. a. \u201cThe Sartorialist,\u201d or Tommy Ton, or Phil Oh, there was Bill, riding his bicycle, reporting on what he saw: the idiosyncratic and the ubiquitous, but above all, the honest. His subject was not what was manufactured to catch his eye, but what people wore to feel part of the group, or to stand out from the group, or to otherwise telegraph their place in the world  \u2014   be it at a   charity ball or at a popular shopping street corner, no matter. Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, has often been quoted as saying, \u201cWe all dressed for Bill. \u201d It\u2019s a lovely and genuine sentiment  \u2014   both fashion and society are peppered by women whose dream was to be photographed by Bill, and having him take your picture became a   seal of approval  \u2014   but the truth is, he wouldn\u2019t have wanted anyone to dress for him. He wanted to understand and record how they dressed for themselves. He himself dressed the part. He created his own uniform years ago, calculated to take himself out of the (bigger) picture: a blue French worker\u2019s jacket, khakis and sneakers. It spoke, proclaiming very loudly, \u201cThis is not about me. \u201d But it was about his eye. He taught me (his pictures taught me) that while what was on the catwalks was interesting, it was what happened to the clothes afterward  \u2014   how they were used, or not used  \u2014   that really mattered. It wasn\u2019t that he rejected fashion he loved it, with a   enthusiasm for discovery. But he understood that its power was personal. Clothes are the front line of communication they are the first thing we say about ourselves to each other, and the first judgment we make in turn. That was his story. And it is why his videos and columns were so obsessively interesting. Harold Koda, the former head of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, once told me that the debate over whether fashion belonged in the museum had been resolved when the powers that be started seeing fashion as a decorative art that represented popular attitudes and mores  \u2014   toward beauty, craft and society  \u2014   at a specific moment in time. This belief also drove Bill, whose thousands of pictures now comprise an invaluable portrait of popular identity in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. They recorded the casualization of life, the rise of the cause ribbon, the advent of the \u201cIt\u201d bag and the problem of global warming (What the hell do you wear when it\u2019s summer in January and snowing in April? ). Street style has become an increasingly ersatz game, less about unique and the revelatory than marketing, with brands shipping clothes to popular stars to wear in theoretically   shots  \u2014   clothes they have not chosen, mind you, but been given (or even paid to wear). In the same way that the red carpet has become an advertising vehicle, so, too, have many sidewalks. Bill represented the truth behind all of that. His legacy is our reality, and we should not forget.'"}, "time": 1742563316.9881704}
