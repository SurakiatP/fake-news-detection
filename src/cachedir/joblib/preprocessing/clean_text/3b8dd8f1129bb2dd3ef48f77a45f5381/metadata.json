S. southern border. [White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the tax with reporters on the way back from Philadelphia after Trump spoke to both houses of Congress.  \u201cIf you tax that $50 billion at 20 percent of imports  \u2026     we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone,\u201d he said, pointing out that an import tax would be similar to other countries. The wall would save money, Spicer explained, by slowing down illegal immigration, and reducing the expenses needed for border enforcement. When asked if the American consumer would suffer as a result of such a tax, Spicer argued that the economy would adjust. \u201cI think what its going to do is lift up the wages of American workers as well,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now we have an influx of cheap labor. Its going to put the American consumer back, net net, to make sure the American workers get lifted up as well. \u201d Spicer clarified afterwards that he was only offering a proposal. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked over and over again \u2018how could you possibly do this, there\u2019s now way that Mexico will pay for it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s one way. Boom. Done. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562754.8530366}
