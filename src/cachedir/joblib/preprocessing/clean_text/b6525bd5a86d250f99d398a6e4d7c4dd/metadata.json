She claimed in the meeting that she speaks with HRC 2-3 times a week and that she was told by the Secretary that the only reason she opposes TPP is to get \u2018labor off her back\u2019 and that once she is elected President she will reverse position. I have worked with our Western Political Director Jessica Meija, and she has connected with the Congresswoman\u2019s COS to clarify the inaccuracy of what she said and push back on her comments. This was not helpful with labor. [ Wikileaks (attachment)]. \u201cInaccuracy.\u201d Of course, of course. \\nTPP: \u201c[Our Revolution,] the progressive group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders has begun a targeted campaign to sway at least five House Democrats to oppose the TPP in hopes it could change the outcome of a ratification vote \u2014 and it\u2019s getting some results\u201d [ Politico ]. \u201cOur Revolution, which Sanders formed in late August to support liberal candidates, has set its sights on at least five other fence-sitting lawmakers. In a vote that\u2019s expected to have razor-thin margins, plundering just a few Democratic votes the White House hoped to gain could make all the difference. The target list includes Reps. Seth Moulton (Mass.), Ed Perlmutter (Colo.), Beto O\u2019Rourke (Texas), Derek Kilmer (Wash.), and Pennsylvania state Rep. Dwight Evans.\u201d \\nTPP: \u201cIn Thursday, Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers published a report warning that if the TPP isn\u2019t passed, a China-backed trade agreement will takes its place. That could put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage when they try to sell to customers in Japan and other Asian nations. The report argues that if China\u2019s Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership goes into effect, at least 35 U.S. industries as diverse as plastics, fishing and footwear will be at risk of increased competition from China in the Japanese market\u201d [ FiveThirtyEight ]. So they\u2019ve settled on this messaging, now? And: \u201c[I]f Clinton wins, Obama might be able to put together a coalition of Republicans and trade-friendly Democrats* to support the treaty. In other words, TPP isn\u2019t dead yet.\u201d * Especially those looking for jobs on K Street. \\nTPP: \u201c\u201dIf TPP is not passed and RCEP is enacted, which is what all these countries say they are planning to do, then U.S. businesses would face a direct loss of competitive position,\u201d said Jason Furman, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers\u201d [ Reuters ]. \u201cThis would displace U.S. goods and be worse than simply maintaining the trade status quo, Furman said. The study identifies 35 industrial sectors employing 4.7 million people with $5.3 billion in sales to Japan that would face such a disadvantage.\u201d \\nTPP: \u201cJapan\u2019s ruling parties push TPP through committee after opposition walkout\u201d [ Nikkei Asian Review ]. \u201cThe next hurdle for the trade deal is a vote during a plenary session of the House of Representatives, expected early next week. It will then be sent to the Diet\u2019s upper house, the House of Councillors.\u201d \\nTPP: \u201cWorking-class U.S. residents already lose about $1,800 annually because wages have been depressed by global competition on labor rates, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. TPP would deepen this problem\u201d [ Detroit Free Press ]. I know the cheap goods are supposed to make up for this, but when your jobs and and what you can afford to buy are both crapified\u2026. \\n2016 \\nDays until: 3! \\nCorruption \\n\u201cTwo former Christie administration insiders charged in a bizarre scheme of political retaliation against a mayor who refused to endorse the governor for re-election were found guilty Friday on all counts in the long-running Bridgegate saga\u201d [ Newark Star-Ledger ]. \u201c\u2018In keeping with the disgrace that was this trial, one of the things the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office should be ashamed of is where it decided to draw the line on who to charge and who not to charge,\u2019 Baroni\u2019s attorney Michael] Baldassare said. \u2018\u2026 They should have had belief in their own case to charge powerful people, and they did not.\u201d Hmm. I wonder which \u201cpowerful people\u201d Baldassare has in mind? \\nOur Famously Free Press \\n\u201cBehind all the Times\u2019 fawning profiles of Clinton \u2014 and the denigrating pieces not only on Trump but also Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders \u2014 was a cozy understanding between Times reporters and the Clinton campaign, WikiLeaks has shown us, that getting Clinton elected is something of a collaborative effort\u201d [ MarketWatch ]. \u201cEditors at the Times, the Washington Post and elsewhere justify this hostility because they have determined that Trump is an existential threat to democracy and the worst presidential nominee in history and can\u2019t be treated as an ordinary candidate. So why do the polls show the worst nominee ever running neck-and-neck with the candidate President Barack Obama has praised as the most qualified person ever to run for president? Do these editors know something that tens of millions of American voters are missing? Whose job is it really to decide what poses a threat to our democracy \u2014 a handful of editors in the corporate media or the voters?\u201d \\nThe Voters \\nNew Hampshire : Clinton 44%, Trump 44%, Johnson 5% ( UMass Lowell ) \\nIowa : Trump 44%, Clinton 41%, Johnson 5% ( RABA Research ) \\nVirginia : Clinton 45%, Trump 38%, Johnson 5% ( Roanoke College ) \\nGeorgia : Trump 48%, Clinton 46%, Johnson 4% ( Landmark ) \\nMissouri : Trump 52%, Clinton 41% ( PPP ) \\nNew Hampshire : Clinton 48%, Trump 43% ( PPP ) \\nNevada : Clinton 48%, Trump 45% ( PPP ) \\nWisconsin : Clinton 48%, Trump 41% ( PPP ) \\nPennsylvania : Clinton 48%, Trump 44% ( PPP ) \\nNorth Carolina : Clinton 49%, Trump 47% ( PPP ) \\nWisconsin : Clinton 44%, Trump 38%, Johnson 7% ( Loras College ) \\nIf I plug all the states where Clinton is ahead into the New York Times \u201cpaths to victory\u201d calculator , Clinton wins \u2014 even if Trump wins Florida. Of course, last I checked, NH was dead even, not Clinton up 4, and I don\u2019t have the chops to assess how good any of these polls are. \\n\u201cTrump is finishing the race the way many Republicans wished he could have run it from the start: fiercely on message and on offense\u201d [ RealClearPolitics ]. \u201cTrump has largely adhered to his teleprompters and resisted controversial tweets this week. As Clinton campaigned a few days ago with Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe winner with whom Trump has infamously feuded, the GOP nominee focused primarily on higher costs for Obamacare and the revived FBI investigation into emails pertinent to Clinton\u2019s private server. The campaign believes those issues bolster his closing argument that Clinton is corrupt and a vestige of old politics, while he says he\u2019s an agent of change.\u201d \\n\u201cOur polling data suggests that the missing whites aren\u2019t exactly conservative populists who support Mr. Trump. They\u2019re just dissatisfied: They don\u2019t like their candidate, and they don\u2019t like the other party\u2019s candidate much either\u201d [ New York Times ]. \u201cThe registered white missing Democrats, for instance, support Mrs. Clinton by only 61 percent to 19 percent. The missing registered white Republicans support Mr. Trump by only 69 to 13.\u201d \\n\u201cElection Update: Why Clinton\u2019s Position Is Worse Than Obama\u2019s\u201d [Nate Silver, FiveThirtyEight ]. \u201cIn the table below, I\u2019ve run a head-to-head comparison showing how many electoral votes each candidate was projected to have at various margins of victory or defeat. For instance, Obama had a lead in states (and congressional districts) totaling 332 electoral votes in our final 2012 forecast. Clinton leads in states totaling only 272 electoral votes, just two more than the minimum she needs to win the Electoral College.\u201d In brief, Clinton is stronger than Obama among highly educated voters in states that she would win anyhow , and weaker among white voters without college degrees in states that are close. \\nWar Drums \\n\u201cThe U.S. government believes hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next week\u2019s presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling, American officials told NBC News. The effort is being coordinated by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, but reaches across the government to include the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department, current and former officials say\u201d [ NBC ]. \u201d Officials are alert for any attempts to create Election Day chaos, and say steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet. But what is more likely, multiple U.S. officials say, is a lower-level effort by hackers from Russia or elsewhere to peddle misinformation by manipulating Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms. For example, officials fear an 11th hour release of fake documents implicating one of the candidates in an explosive scandal without time for the news media to fact check it. \\nThe Trail \\n\u201cWith Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump breathtakingly close in polls of key states, analysts are beginning to factor in the possibility of recounts that would delay the outcome\u201d [ MarketWatch ]. \u201cBear in mind that a candidate would have limited time to contest the vote. This year, the Electoral College is due to meet on Dec. 19. By law, electors meet on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.\u201d A recount would make Florida 2000 look like a walk in the park, especially because Clinton, bless her heart, is unlikely to let herself be rolled, unlike Gore. \\nMichigan: \u201cHillary Clinton is hanging onto a narrow 4-point lead over Donald Trump in Michigan heading into the last weekend before Tuesday\u2019s election, with a new Free Press poll showing clear momentum for the Republican nominee in a state that several weeks ago was believed all but decided for the Democrat\u201d [ Detroit Free Press ]. \u201d [T]he number of undecided voters \u2014 13% \u2014 remains extraordinarily high for this late in an election cycle, speaking to the high unfavorable marks voters give both major party candidates.\u201d Normally, I\u2019d say a 4% lead is a lot, but those undecideds. Wowsers. \\nRealignment \\n\u201cWho Broke Politics?\u201d [Paul Krugman, New York Times ]. \u201cSo how did all our political norms get destroyed? Hint: It started long before Donald Trump. On one side\u2026.\u201d Hint: You will read to the end of the column without finding the \u201cOn the other side\u201d that \u201con one side\u201d sets up. I mean, it wasn\u2019t mean Republicans who prevented Obama from throwing the banksters in jail, was it? \\n\u201cAmerica and the Abyss\u201d [Andrew Sullivan, New York Magazine ]. Of course, if Trump really were a fascist, the Democratic Establishment would fight him tooth and nail. Right? \\n\u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t break one of our two great and ancestral political parties. He won the nomination because the Republican Party was already broken, and those responsible for the party, the elected officials and thinkers, didn\u2019t know. Now they do\u201d [Peggy Noonan, Wall Street Journal , \u201cDemocracy\u2019s Majesty and 2016\u2019s Indignity\u201d]. \u201cSoon they will begin that stage of political mourning known as the symposia process. They\u2019ll discuss how to repair, renew, keep the party together. Or the party will, over the next few cycles, split apart\u2026 The Democratic Party and its lobbyist/think-tank/journalistic establishment in Washington have long looked to me to be dominated by people devoted mostly to getting themselves in the best professional position and their kids into Sidwell Friends School. They want to be part of the web, the arrangement. They want to have connections, associates, a tong. They want to be wired in. They don\u2019t want to be I.F. Stone, alone, reading the fine print of obscure government documents. And Clintonism\u2014for years the biggest web, the securest source of money, a real tong with enforcers and reward-dispensers\u2014has long been a sound route to all of this. You may have to bend rules to be part of it, accept unsavory deals and characters, but it is warm and cozy in there.\u201d And: \\nOne thing I saw this year was that sincere conservatives wholly opposed to socialism had real respect for Bernie Sanders because they saw his sincerity. He wasn\u2019t part of the web and they honored him for it. \\nI never thought I\u2019d find myself writing this, but for punditry I\u2019ll take Nooners over Krugman\u2019s hackery or Sullivan\u2019s hysterical ranting. It\u2019s been quite a year. \\nDemocrat Email Hairball \\n\u201cThe Podesta Emails Part 29\u201d [ Wikileaks ]. \\n\u201c[A] meeting between POTUS and HRC at a critical time\u201d [ Reddit (aliteralmind)].

Particularly the genesis of the meeting in previous meeting between Podesta and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough in an \u201coffsite\u201d Starbucks near the White House. If I were Putin, I\u2019d have that Starbucks wired to the gills. \\n\u201cWhat the WikiLeaks emails tell us about Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign (and what they don\u2019t)\u201d [ Los Angeles Times ]. Death of a thousand cuts. \\n\u201cThe real Clinton email scandal is that a bullshit story has dominated the campaign\u201d [Matt Yglesias, Vox ]. Oh, Matty. \\nStats Watch \\nEmployment Situation, October 2016: Unemployment Rate \u2013 Level (4.9 %); Participation Rate \u2013 level (62.8%) [ Econoday ]. \u201cSolid payroll growth is not the whole story of the October employment report. Average hourly earnings are rising, up an outsized 0.4 percent in the month with the year-on-year rate, at 2.8 percent, suddenly near 3.0 percent and at its recovery peak\u2026 The unemployment rate is down 1 tenth to 4.9 percent and, for some, is already signaling full employment for the labor market.But negatives are scarce in this report, where strength is emphatically underscored by the unexpected acceleration in average hourly earnings which further includes an upward revision to September. Today\u2019s report marks a solid opening to fourth-quarter data and will raise talk of a wage-inflation flashpoint\u2026\u201d Gotta take the punchbowl away from lower orders! But: \u201d The number of persons working part time for economic reasons was essentially unchanged in October. This level suggests slack still in the labor market\u201d [ Calculated Risk ]. Moreover: \u201ct\u2019s also worth noting that the standard measure of unemployment \u2014 now at 5 percent \u2014 doesn\u2019t capture the lingering weakness in the market seen in the broader U6 measure, which includes discouraged workers, other workers marginally attached to the labor force and those in temporary jobs because they can\u2019t get full-time work. The conventional unemployment measure is a hair below its mean from 2003-7, which is 5.2 percent. The broader U6, however, at 9.7 percent is higher than its 2003-7 mean of 9.1 percent. This is just another sign that there\u2019s still slack in the labor market.\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. And: \u201cShould we believe the employment numbers in this report? There is little evidence of political bias in past election cycles\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \u201cTo sum this report up \u2013 employment is continuing to tread water \u2013 growing little better than the theoretical working population growth. However, note that the household survey removed 43,000 to the workforce (which is the reason the unemployment rate declined). There was really nothing good or nothing really terrible \u2013 although manufacturing declined. The year-over-year rate of growth significantly declined this month.\u201d Again, the Econoday summary is just a little too breathless for this Maine bear. \\nInternational Trade, September 2016: \u201cA decline in imports helped pull down the nation\u2019s trade gap sharply in September, to $36.4 billion from a revised $40.5 billion in August. Imports, reflecting declines for capital goods and also consumer goods, fell 1.1 percent while exports, showing an especially strong gain for capital goods, rose 0.6 percent\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cDeclining imports are a plus for the GDP calculation but are not signals of strength for domestic demand, whether business demand for capital goods or business expectations for consumer imports ahead of the holidays.\u201d And: \u201cDeclining imports are a plus for the GDP calculation but are not signals of strength for domestic demand, whether business demand for capital goods or business expectations for consumer imports ahead of the holidays\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nJobless Claims: \u201cHowever, comparing initial claims today with the past is the proverbial apples to oranges. An important fact in looking at claims data is that vastly fewer people today are eligible for unemployment benefits. In other words, the number of unemployed people who can\u2019t receive jobless benefits \u2014 and thus are not in the initial claims data \u2014 has risen relative to those who have unemployment insurance\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. As Mosler has been saying. \\nHousing: \u201cResidential remodeling has recovered to 38% of the peak it attained prior to the Great Recession. New residential construction, on the other hand, is only at 17% of the peak\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nRetail: \u201cThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has just announced that Samsung is having to recall its top-load washing machines due to a risk of impact injuries. The exact hazard listed was that the washing machine top can unexpectedly detach from the washing machine chassis during use, posing a risk of injury from impact\u201d [ 247 Wall Street ]. \u201cWhat matters here is that this will not be a cheap recall. You can drive a smartphone back to the store or mail it in cheaply. Have you ever tried moving a washing machine, or just dealing with getting a technician out to deliver or fix one? And the size of this recall is huge \u2014 about 2.8 million total units!\u201d Korea is really having its troubles, isn\u2019t it? Samsung is a failing national champion, Hanjin went bankrupt, and there\u2019s a ginormous scandal with their President. \\nShipping: \u201cIn August, the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA) reported its first quarterly volume decline for the first time after 25 straight quarters of growth. Earlier this week, marked its second straight quarterly volume decline, officially extending more of an unwelcome streak\u201d [ Logistics Management ]. \u201cTotal third quarter intermodal volume movements\u2014at 4,348,634\u2014were off 4.6 percent annually, following a 6.1 percent second quarter decline at 4,271,162. The first quarter of 2016 saw volumes rise 2.0 percent annually. \u2026 Like recent quarters, domestic containers were the lone metric to see an increase.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cOrders for heavy-duty commercial trucks in North America plummeted 46% in October from the same month last year, providing a grim outlook for truck manufacturers in the coming year\u201d [ Wall Street Journal , \u201cTruck Orders Tumbled 46% in October \u201c]. \u201cIn an analyst note Thursday, Stifel said the October order total was the weakest since 2009, falling well below expectations. \u201cOctober orders are critical as they represent the traditional start to the order season for trucks to be produced the next year,\u201d the report said.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cAfter four days [!!!] firefighters have finally managed to douse the terrible tanker blaze that killed many workers at a shipbreaking site in Gadani, Pakistan. Rescue work inside the hull of the Indonesian ship cannot start however as the steel plates are still too hot\u201d [ Splash 247 ]. \u201cWhile there are now 21 confirmed dead, the eventual death toll could hit triple figures with many unaccounted for inside the hull of the ship and a number of the 60 workers sent to hospital deemed to have such severe burns that they are unlikely to survive.\u201d The human cost of excess capacity. \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cGoPro\u2019s forward statements are not believable, in light of its recent performance, and management\u2019s ability to forecast. It is also essentially a one-product company, and that product does not sell very well\u201d [ 247 Wall Street ]. \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cthe app economy may have passed its peak. CB Insights analyzed the company descriptions of thousands of startup companies receiving VC funding for the first time between 2010 and today, scanning for buzzwords that describe the companies\u2019 field of focus. While \u2018app] is still the keyword that shows up in the most company descriptions, the share of startups working with apps in some way has declined for three straight years\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \u201cLooking at the terms with the largest increase in mentions in startup company descriptions between 2010 and 2016 possibly allows us to glimpse into the future and gives us an idea of what the next big thing might be. According to CB Insights\u2019 analysis, these terms are \u2018virtual reality\u2019, \u2018machine learning\u2019 and \u2018natural language.'\u201d I think reality is quite virtual enough already, thank you. \\nThe Fed: \u201cCentral bank independence \u2018comes from an understanding of the macroeconomic policy problem that is not relevant to current times,\u2019 Summers said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund\u201d [ MarketWatch ]. \u201cDuring the question-and-answer session, Summers said he did not think that entitlement reform should be on the immediate agenda for the next administration. He said that policy makers should focus solely on accelerating growth. If they are successful in sparking demand, the long-run debt-to-GDP ratio will be sustainable, he said.
