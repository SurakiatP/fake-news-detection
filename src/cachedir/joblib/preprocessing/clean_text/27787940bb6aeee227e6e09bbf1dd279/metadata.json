The memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president. \\nIn one arrangement, Kelly introduced Bob McCann, the head of UBS Wealth Management, to Clinton at an event in 2009. \\nAfter the meeting, McCann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting Clinton to give several paid speeches. \\nAnother arrangement involved the Laureate Foundation, which donated more than $1 million to the Clinton Global Initiative. \\nLaureate was a \u201cpersonal advisory services business,\u201d the memo said, paying Clinton \u201c$3.5\\u2009million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman.\u201d \\nThe cozy relationship with the Clintons put the Baltimore-based Laureate at high-profile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe. \\nThe Band memo also includes a section about \u201cFor-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e., Bill Clinton Inc.).\u201d \\nSome of the speeches \u201csecured\u201d by Teneo include two $450,000 addresses delivered to UBS in 2011 and 2012, as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches, if he chose to give them. \\nAnother secured event was a $1 million fee for Clinton to speak at two one-hour sessions during an event in Hong Kong. The fee included $400,000 for a private plane. \\n\u201cSince 2001, President Clinton\u2019s business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements,\u201d the memo reads. \\nThe relationship between Band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter Chelsea Clinton in another e-mail. \\nChelsea specifically called out Band and Teneo for \u201chustling\u2019\u201d business opportunities out of the foundation. \\n\u201cI continue to want \u2014 and to try \u2014 to disintermediate myself from this muddle, edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in \u2014 while also being a responsible board member, daughter and person,\u201d Chelsea wrote in the 2011 e-mail. \\nThe relationship between foundation donors and Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department was raised through e-mails obtained by Citizens United in which top Hillary aide Huma Abedin appeared to vet donors\u2019 access to the Clintons based on their links to the CGI. \\nIn a December 2012 e-mail in which a CGI official asks for Band and a few others to meet with Hillary during a trip to Ireland, Abedin writes to Band, \u201cAre these legit cgi people?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562450.248251}
