The heart-on-chip is composed of a small piece of flexible polymer with integrated sensors that contains living human heart cells , which can mimic the physiological response of a human heart. \\nThe sensors collect data on the beating of the heart-on-chip, which can be used to study how tissue responds to drugs or toxins. \\nScientists from the Wyss Institute at Harvard University believe the technology is a more accurate alternative to testing drugs on animals, and hope it can decrease the number of animals used for testing. \\n\u201cWe are pushing the boundaries of three-dimensional printing by developing and integrating multiple functional materials within printed devices,\u201d Jennifer Lewis, senior co-author of the study said in a press release. \\nOther organs, including bones, lungs, the liver, and gut can also be made into organs on a chip. \\nHowever, it is noted that obtaining data from these chips is costly and can only be done using high-speed cameras or microscopy.
