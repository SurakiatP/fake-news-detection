Fettuccine With Asparagus and Smoked Salmon This elegant pasta dish from Florence Fabricant is so easy, it feels like cheating. Make a quick    sauce then toss with pasta, smoked salmon and steamed asparagus. (Here\u2019s a shortcut: Cook the asparagus with the pasta.) Frozen peas are a welcome addition, and dried dill will do if you don\u2019t have, can\u2019t find or can\u2019t afford the fresh sort. Dutch Baby Also known as a German oven pancake, this giant popover is simple: Just dump the ingredients  \u2014   eggs, flour, sugar, milk and a pinch of nutmeg  \u2014   into a blender and give it a good whirl. (You can also whisk everything together in a bowl.) Then pour it into a hot, ovenproof skillet or baking dish that\u2019s sizzling with melted better and bake for about 25 minutes. Serve with confectioners\u2019 sugar, maple syrup or jam. If you\u2019re serving it for dessert, a scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate ganache would not hurt. Salmon Roasted in Butter Here\u2019s a    dish from Mark Bittman that makes a stunning meatless main course. In a hot oven, melt butter with a sprinkle of fresh herbs in a roasting pan or a large ovenproof skillet until it sizzles. Add the salmon, flip, remove the skin, then allow to roast a few minutes more. Shower with more fresh herbs and serve. Fifteen minutes from start to finish. Garlicky Chicken With   Sauce Get ready to file this foolproof recipe under \u201cthe dishes I return to again and again. \u201d It\u2019s that good. Yes, there are anchovies, but don\u2019t let that scare you. They dissolve, and in cahoots with the garlic, capers and lemon, they make an outrageously flavorful sauce. Melissa Clark calls for boneless chicken thighs here they\u2019re more forgiving and cheaper. But you can use breasts. (Just reduce the cooking time by about 3 minutes.) Serve with rice, which absorbs the heavenly sauce in the most wonderful way. Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse With Fleur de Sel This recipe is like the party trick of desserts. Developed by the molecular gastronomist Herv\u00e9 This, it requires only good bittersweet chocolate, fleur de sel and a strong arm. Melt the chocolate with a bit of water, then pour into a bowl submerged in an ice bath. Whisk for three to five minutes until it\u2019s fluffy, garnish with a bit of salt and serve. Want more?
