The attack are being coordinated in our view by the same groups involved in the expanding scourge of globalization. \\nMore: \\nOn 25 October 2015, Christoph Biro wrote of the masses of migrants who were travelling through the Syrian countryside and remarked on the assaults and property damage committed by migrants, reports Kurier. \\nCalling the majority of the migrants \u201ctestosterone-driven Syrians\u201d, Mr. Biro recounted the multiple reports of migrants carrying out, in his words, \u201cextremely aggressive sexual assaults\u201d. \\nHe also detailed Afghan men had slashed the seats of the trains that were transporting them to Germany because they refused to sit where Christians had previously sat. \\nBiro did not perform the acts but merely reported on them and drew a conclusion. But nonetheless he may go to jail. \\nHis case is not isolated but part of a trend. It is one that has reached the US, where Hillary Clinton has hinted at the adoption of similar approaches should she become president. \\nIn fact, both Clinton and President Barack Obama have suggested that those who are involved in \u201chate speech\u201d via media presentations ought to suffer \u201cconsequences.\u201d \\nThe argument is that such writing disturbs civil society and encourages violence. But this is wrongheaded. People should be prosecuted for actual violence \u2013 for deeds not words. \\nZeroHedge reports: \\nA couple of days ago we noted that protests in North Dakota, over the Dakota Access Pipeline, were growing increasingly hostile with police arresting over 125 people just last weekend alone. \\nAnother startling discovery from the weekend was reports of police efforts to shoot down multiple media drones which some thought indicated an increasing hostility toward press seeking to cover the protests. \\nCertainly, Deia Schlosberg, a documentarian who was recently charged with three felonies for filming activists shutting off oil pipelines, would tend to agree. \\nThe point here is that Schlosberg is not being prosecuted for deeds, only for her coverage. \\nThis is part of a larger effort to conflate reporting with \u201cdoing\u201d \u2013 and marks a virtual revolution in the way journalism is conducted. \\nIn the future, if this tact is pursued, it will be government and law enforcement that can decide what\u2019s going to be covered, depending on the interpretation of the coverage. \\nConclusion: If the reporting is seen as \u201cinciting\u201d violence or disturbance of civil society, the reporter can face legal consequences as grave or graver than the individuals actually performing the actions. This amounts to virulent censorship.'"}, "time": 1742628336.8854167}
