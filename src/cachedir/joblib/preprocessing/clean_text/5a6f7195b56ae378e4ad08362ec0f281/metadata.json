Spouting all sorts of shite about redrawing maps and taking back what is rightfully theirs. Gas all the same,\u201d shared Louth native Trevor Gorman, whose uncle would periodically go up north for something called \u2018training\u2019 in the 90s. \\n\u201cLook, you\u2019ll just have to give me some time. People in the Middle East are well accustomed to violent loonies hiding behind a religion to commit horrible acts, but this is all new to us, and him being Irish\u2026 that\u2019s mad,\u201d said Cavan man Sean Dignam, from the comfort of a stool in an IRA owned pub. \\nThe view from across the country found people similarly shocked that an Irishman could find himself part of a morally compromised, ideologically bankrupt outfit. \\n\u201cTheir followers out there, they\u2019re bold a pup from what I hear, but Muslims lads here shoudl really out denouncing that right now,\u201d shared Dubliner Ciaran Mackey. \\n\u201cThe Jihadis go on and on about how there only concerns are Islamic terror and that, but then ya read they\u2019re selling drugs too, which goes against everything they be saying or beliefs and that. And they do other awful stuff like abusing girls. I tell ya, we don\u2019t have any terrorists in Ireland, but if we did, they wouldn\u2019t be at that craic at all,\u201d added Mackey.'"}, "time": 1742562952.1926804}
