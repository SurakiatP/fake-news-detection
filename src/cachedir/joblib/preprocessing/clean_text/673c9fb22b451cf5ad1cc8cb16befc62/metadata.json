Tweaking that for an insurance company was pretty easy. \\n\u201cI simply liked a number of Facebook pages about driver safety, signed a petition calling for lower speed limits on UK roads, added a couple of driving safety courses as Life Events, and even put a couple of posts on my historic timeline about how people are \u2018driving way too fast past the school these days\u2019. \\n\u201cAlso, Driving Miss Daisy is now my favourite film, by the way. \\n\u201cIt would definitely have got me cheaper car insurance. It was a flawless plan. \\n\u201cOf course, Facebook has now put an end to that \u2013 the bastards.
