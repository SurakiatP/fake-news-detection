A bigger newsroom is coming in Washington, the better to cover a   whose candidacy it embraced. Mainstream news outlets are   in the wake of being shocked by Donald J. Trump\u2019s election last week. But the team at Breitbart News, the   opinion and news website that some critics have denounced as a hate site, is elated  \u2014   and eager to expand on a victory that it views as a profound validation of its cause. \u201cSo much of the media mocked us, laughed at us, called us all sorts of names,\u201d Alexander Marlow, the site\u2019s editor in chief, said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cAnd then for us to be seen as integral to the election of a president, despite all of that hatred, is something that we certainly enjoy, and savor. \u201d Breitbart not only championed Mr. Trump its chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, helped run his campaign. On Sunday, Mr. Trump named Mr. Bannon as his chief White House strategist and senior counselor, further closing the distance between Breitbart\u2019s newsroom and the  . Those who consider Mr. Trump, who has vilified the news media, a threat to the free press view Mr. Bannon\u2019s appointment as more cause for alarm. Critics say Breitbart now has the potential to play an unprecedented role in a modern presidency, as a weaponized media adjunct for the White House. \u201cIt will be as close as we are ever going to have  \u2014   hopefully  \u2014   to a   media enterprise,\u201d said Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who quit the site this year, saying it had turned into a de facto \u201csuper PAC\u201d for Mr. Trump. Breitbart has been denounced as misogynist, racist and xenophobic, and it served as a clearinghouse for attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s adversaries, spreading unsubstantiated rumors about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and undermining its own reporter, Michelle Fields, after she accused Corey Lewandowski, then Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, of assaulting her. The site frequently boasts about knowing the pulse of its readers. News articles with evocative headlines, like \u201cParis Streets Turned into WARZONE by Violent Migrants,\u201d are frequently followed by comments from readers about \u201cthe enemy within,\u201d migrant \u201cscum\u201d and the \u201c  media. \u201d Breitbart\u2019s writers often vilify the Black Lives Matter movement, emphasizing what they say is a wave of \u201c   crime. \u201d But the site\u2019s influence on social media, where more and more Americans now consume information, has been palpable. On election night, Breitbart\u2019s Facebook page received the   number of user interactions on the entire platform  \u2014   beating Fox News, CNN and The New York Times. Mr. Marlow, the editor, praised Mr. Bannon on Sunday, saying, \u201cSteve understands the voters, the American people, better than just about anyone. \u201d But he rejected the premise that Breitbart could become an American version of Pravda. \u201cOur loyalty is not going to be to Donald Trump our loyalty is to our readers and to our values,\u201d Mr. Marlow, 30, said. \u201cThat\u2019s regardless of what role Steve has. \u201d \u201cIf Trump runs his administration and honors the voters who voted him in, we\u2019re all good,\u201d Mr. Marlow added. \u201cBut if he is going to turn his back on those values and principles that drove his voters to the polls, we\u2019re going to be highly critical. We\u2019re not going to think twice about it. \u201d For now, Breitbart is supporting the  . Its   Day coverage has been, if anything, emboldened: \u201cMeltdown Continues: Wave of Fake \u2018Hate Crimes\u2019 Sweeps Social Media,\u201d read a headline on its home page on Sunday, attempting to cast doubt on a wave of reports of intimidation and harassment by Trump supporters. \u201c  Crybabies March by Thousands Nationwide,\u201d read another. The site\u2019s expansion of political coverage comes at a time when other news outlets in Washington are concerned about staying relevant with readers  \u2014   and girding for tensions with a   who denounces reporters as dishonest, or worse. A spokesman for the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, which coordinates press coverage of the White House, declined to comment on Mr. Bannon\u2019s appointment. Andrew Breitbart, the site\u2019s founder, who died in 2012, \u201cused to talk about the   complex,\u201d recalled Ben Shapiro, Breitbart\u2019s former editor at large. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a more   complex than Breitbart and the Trump team,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fascinated to see if there are any points of departure, any points of criticism at all. \u201d Outlets like Fox News, which has a large Republican audience, insist that Breitbart is no competitor, saying that an   outlet with few known personalities can hardly compete with television networks that reach tens of millions of homes. Breitbart receives far fewer unique web visitors than Fox News\u2019s digital sites, according to statistics from comScore. Still, its Facebook audience has more than doubled in the last year, and it frequently sets the agenda for social media users with their own mass followings. The site has spotlighted nationalist views and conspiracies once relegated to the   fringe. Larry Solov, Breitbart\u2019s chief executive, declined on Sunday to provide revenue figures for the site. Nor would he comment on whether Mr. Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs banker, retains a financial stake. (Mr. Solov is a part owner, along with Andrew Breitbart\u2019s estate and the family of Robert Mercer, a wealthy Trump donor.) Speaking by telephone from Hearst Castle in California, which he was visiting for a postelection vacation, Mr. Solov said that his teams had been flooded with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from reporters and even some aspiring journalists with no experience, \u201cwho feel motivated and energized. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve built a community, and I really emphasize that,\u201d Mr. Solov said. \u201cPeople come to us because they feel they belong to something. \u201d Mr. Marlow, the editor, said the site\u2019s international expansion was tied to upcoming elections in France and Germany. He said that Breitbart planned to support the candidacy of Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s   National Front party. \u201cThere\u2019s an underserved readership\u201d in Europe, Mr. Marlow said, before referring to the recent \u201cBrexit\u201d vote. \u201cIt\u2019s the same readers who had been ignored in Britain and had been ignored in the United States. \u201d On Sunday, with Mr. Bannon elevated to one of the country\u2019s most powerful positions, the site took on a celebratory air. Linking to a story about Mr. Bannon\u2019s new role, the @BreitbartNews Twitter account wrote, to its more than 400, 000 followers: \u201cWhat a time to be alive. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563495.4812777}
