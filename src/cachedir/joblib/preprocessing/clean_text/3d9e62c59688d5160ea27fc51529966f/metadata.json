America will be undergo a tremendous test in the next term, as terrorism, war, a divided population and the global economy all threaten to explode on his watch, leaving the situation open to exploit by the advisors and appointees of the Deep State, and the secret societies that create and steer world affairs. \\nAfter decades as a billionaire businessman, Trump is finally playing ball in the big leagues, and that means some very serious characters at work in and around his office of power. \\nIf Trump thinks he\u2019s now the big boss, he\u2019d better be very careful and watch is back. History has a lot to say about JFK\u2019s assassination \u2013 because it concerns his attempt to oust the shadow powers from his administration. \\nRon Paul on Trump\u2019s Election: Beware of the Shadow Government \\nby The Daily Sheeple\\nFormer congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul appeared on RT to talk about the election of Donald Trump as president, and he voiced major skepticism on whether Trump will actually follow through on many of his campaign promises.\\n\\nPaul referenced Trump\u2019s independence as being a political outsider and that this possibly could have a more favorable outcome than we might have seen with Hillary Clinton in the Oval Office. However, he notes that we cannot determine what plans for Trump\u2019s presidency the shadow government might have. Speaking of this secret power structure, he said:\\nYou know, we look at the president, we look at what he said, we look at what he might do, and we look at his advisors, but quite frankly, there is an outside source, which we refer to as a deep state or a shadow government. There is a lot of influence by people that are actually more powerful than our government itself, our president and on up. I mean, you take for instance how our government gets involved in elections around the world, whether it\u2019s in the Middle East or Ukraine. \\nPaul is not particularly pleased with the war-driven neoconservatives who are beginning to surround Trump. \u201cUnfortunately, there has been several neoconservatives that are getting closer to Trump. And if he gets his advice from them then I do not think that is a good sign,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the campaign, he did talk a little bit about backing off and being less confrontational to Russia and I like that. He criticized some of the wars in the Middle East at the same time. He believes we should accelerate the war against ISIS and terrorism.\u201d\\nPaul thinks that the Wikileaks release of the nearly 60,000 hacked Podesta emails is what ultimately secured Trump to the presidency, but he thinks that the hidden power structure is brewing something in the background to maintain their dominion over the US presidency. \u201cYes, Trump is his own guy, more so than most of those who have ever been in before. We hope he can maintain an independence and go in the right direction. But I fear the fact that there is so much that can be done secretly, out of control of our apparent government and out of the view of so many citizens,\u201d he cautioned.\\nPaul does not have high hopes that Trump will follow through on his campaign promise to disengage from the NATO alliance. He expects that Trump\u2019s intentions as president will become clear once we see who he appoints to his cabinet.\\nThis article was written and originally published at The Daily Sheeple . \\n'"}, "time": 1742563840.6274722}
