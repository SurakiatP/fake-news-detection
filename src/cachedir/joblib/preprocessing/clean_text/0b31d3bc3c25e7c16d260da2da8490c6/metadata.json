I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general,\u201d Clinton said in response to a question from Fox News debate moderator Chris Wallace.\\n\u201cThis would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the Russians and Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground \u2026 I think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in Syria.\u201d (Fox News, emphasis added)\\nAt present, under the Obama administration, the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the \u201cNo Fly zone\u201d.\\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff are appointed by the Secretary of Defense.\\nUnder a Clinton presidency, a new Secretary of Defense as well as a new Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, firmly committed to \u201cA No fly Zone\u201d over Syria would be appointed.\\nMich\u00e8le Angelique Flournoy, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy is Hillary\u2019s choice for the position of Secretary of Defense, who favors the \u201cNo Fly Zone\u201d option. \\nAccording to Defense One: \u201dThe woman expected to run the Pentagon under Hillary Clinton said she would direct U.S. troops to push President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces out of southern Syria and would send more American boots to fight the Islamic State in the region.\u201d\\n\\n\\nConfirmed by the Leaked Emails Michele Flournoy is a crony of the Clintons. She has \u201ccalled for \u201climited military coercion\u201d to help remove Assad from power in Syria, including a \u201cno bombing\u201d zone over parts of Syria held by U.S.-backed rebels.\u201d This is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including ISIS Daesh from actions by Syrian and Russian forces.\\nAccording to Defense One: \\nFlournoy, and several of her colleagues at the Center for New American Security, or CNAS, have been making the case for sending more American troops into combat against ISIS and the Assad regime than the Obama administration has been willing to commit.\\nSince Russia\u2019s increased involvement, the facts on the ground in Syria, she said, \u201cDo not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to.\u201d U.S. policy should be the removal of Assad even if that meant \u201cusing limited military coercion,\u201d Flournoy said, at Monday\u2019s annual CNAS conference in Washington.\\nFlournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased U.S. intervention; for instance, she acknowledged her support for U.S. \u201cstrikes using standoff weapons \u2014 to retaliate against Syrian military targets\u201d to enforce the no-bomb zone.\\nThe press reports, however, did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of General Dunford and Secretary of Defense Carter at the Arms Services Committee Hearing:\\nLet me see if the Chairman wants to add anything.\\nSenator Wicker: Well, let me just ask this, if you don\u2019t mind, Secretary Carter. It would help if the barrel bombing ended. And I spoke to a Democratic colleague of mine today. I\u2019ve been calling for a no-fly zone to stop the barrel bombing, and I asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that. And he said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cI want to call it something else, rather than a no-fly zone,\u201d but that this particular Senator it is a fact that this particular Senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present \u2014 to prevent the barrel bombing.\\nWhat is your position about that? And wouldn\u2019t it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage? Secretary Carter: I don\u2019t know the specific proposal which you\u2019re discussing with your colleague. I\u2019ll make one comment and see if the Chairman wants to add anything. Senator Wicker: I think he was talking about a no-fly zone \u2013\\nSecretary Carter: Well, okay.\\nSenator Wicker: \u2014 but described in more palatable terms.\\nSecretary Carter: There are \u2014 a number of different proposals have been made, but I \u2014 the one that I think it the focus on right now is the one Secretary Kerry\u2019s trying to promote, namely a no-fly zone for the Russians and the Syrians who are attacking the Syrian people . If they\u2019re talking about a no-fly zone for American aircraft fighting ISIL, needless to say, that \u2014 that\u2019s not going to get any enthusiasm, get strong opposition from me.\\nSenator Wicker: I\u2019m speaking about a \u2013\\nSecretary Carter: But, I think that\u2019s what a \u2014 but \u2014 it\u2019s not called that, but Secretary Kerry is trying to get a standdown of the Syrian and Russian air force. And if he\u2019s successful, that would be a good thing.\\nLet me ask the Chairman if he has anything to add.\\nGeneral Dunford: Senator, the only thing I\u2019d say is, you know, as the situation on the ground changes, I think I have a responsibility \u2014 we, the joint force, has a responsibility \u2014 to make sure the President has a full range of options. We have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions. The conditions on the ground will change, and we\u2019ll continue to look at those options and make sure they\u2019re available to the President.\\nSenator Wicker: What about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped?\\nGeneral Dunford: All options \u2013\\nSenator Wicker: What do you think of that option, sir?\\nGeneral Dunford: Right now, Senator, for all of the airspace in Syria, it would require war against Syria and Russia. That\u2019s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I\u2019m not going to make. \\n\\nConcluding Remarks \\nFrom the above testimonies and statements, one thing is clear. Decision-makers at highest levels of the US government and the military believe in their own propaganda. They are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda. And this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a \u201cpeace-making operation\u201d.\\nIt is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a \u201cno fly zone\u201d will be taken under the Obama administration prior to the November elections and the instatement of a new president of the US in January 2017.\\nConsequently, the next three months will be absolutely crucial for Syria. \u2013i.e. During this period, the counterterrorism campaign waged by Syria with the support of Russia and Iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country.\\nThe foot-soldiers of the Western military alliance will be defeated on the ground. If this objective is achieved, it will inevitably have an impact on \u201cUS options\u201d regarding the proposed deployment of ground-forces and the No Fly Zone. What prevails, however, is an attempt on the part of Washington to redeploy its ISIS terrorist foot-soldiers in Mosul by transferring them from Iraq to Syria.\\nDelivered by The Daily Sheeple \\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ). \\nContributed by Global Research of Centre for Research on Globalization . \\nThe Global Research website was established on the 9th of September 2001, two days before the tragic events of September 11.
