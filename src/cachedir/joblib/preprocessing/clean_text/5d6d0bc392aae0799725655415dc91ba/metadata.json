The American tech giant\u2019s search engine alone gobbles up roughly 90 percent of the European market. But a landmark court ruling intended to rein in Google has instead put it at the forefront of Europe\u2019s enforcement of Internet privacy. That has upended conventional wisdom about the company and raised questions about the role of commercial interests in protecting people\u2019s privacy, often with little or no transparency. In the almost two years since Europeans gained the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d on the Internet, Google has passed judgment in over 418, 000 cases  \u2014   roughly 572 a day  \u2014   from people wanting links of certain search results to be removed, according to the company\u2019\u2019s records. It has approved fewer than half of those requests, all behind closed doors. Google\u2019s total number of   judgments is double those of most of Europe\u2019s biggest individual national authorities over the same period, even though these public agencies address a wider range of data protection complaints. Despite a history of animosity toward the company, national regulators have handed over the review powers to Google with few complaints, saying they are merely following Europe\u2019s complex data protection rules. Other search companies, including Microsoft, have been given the same authority, though their number of judgments pales by comparison. Some consumer groups and privacy experts are not satisfied with that arrangement. They have sounded alarm bells over a   company  \u2014   one that relies on tapping into people\u2019s digital lives to make billions of dollars and that is the subject of multiple privacy and antitrust investigations  \u2014   playing such a central role in protecting individuals\u2019 data, and doing so in such a secretive manner. Google has not responded to requests, including an open letter last year from primarily European and American academics, to explain how its review process works. And since 2014, when \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d was enshrined, the company has declined to give any journalists access to its team of fewer than 50 employees  \u2014   mostly lawyers and paralegals based at its Dublin offices  \u2014   who review the demands. Google also did not respond to questions for this article about the decision process. \u201cIt\u2019s a   solution,\u201d said Luciano Floridi, a University of Oxford professor who previously sat on an advisory council to help Google handle its role as a de facto privacy regulator. \u201cIf Europe really wanted to regain control over personal data, giving Google this type of power is an odd outcome. \u201d Less than 1 percent of Google\u2019s decisions are appealed to Europe\u2019s privacy authorities, according to the regulators\u2019 statistics, and those authorities said they generally ruled in the company\u2019s favor. But several individuals who sent requests to Google told The New York Times that the lack of detail over how these decisions were made left them frustrated and, in some cases, angry that a company adjudicated on such delicate matters. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to publicize their own privacy cases. \u201cIf governments were handling \u2018right to be forgotten,\u2019 they would have to publish data,\u201d said Martin Husovec, a professor at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society in the Netherlands, and a signatory of the open letter to Google. \u201cBut with Google, we can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening behind the company\u2019s closed doors. \u201d After Europe\u2019s highest court ruled in May 2014 that people with connections to the Continent could ask search engines like Google and Microsoft\u2019s Bing to remove links about themselves from online search results, the companies were handed the power to decide which of these requests were legitimate. Citing European privacy rules, the European Court of Justice mandated that search engines, and not a public body, should be the first port of call for the decisions. Europe\u2019s top court did not require that companies make their   process open to public scrutiny. People\u2019s privacy requests must relate to online information, like personal circumstances or a past criminal conviction, that is no longer relevant or not in the public interest, definitions that privacy lawyers say are inherently fuzzy. Thus far, that has mostly involved people demanding mundane information like phone numbers or addresses be removed from links to online directories (the largest collective group of sites affected). Individuals have also requested that links to references about themselves on social media, including Facebook, be taken down. In some cases, however, newspaper articles, including one in The Times covering somewhat questionable business practices, have been removed from European search results. Elsewhere, a Romanian website that publishes court proceedings has been hit with complaints. People requesting the removal of links must submit an online form, attaching an official ID. Though Google would not comment publicly about the review process, two company executives gave some detail on how decisions were made. They spoke to The Times on the condition they not be named. Typically, requests are sent to Google\u2019s legal team. Straightforward rulings, like those that involve a public figure who cannot legally apply for links to be removed, are handled by junior staff members. Tougher decisions are referred to senior lawyers who must weigh an individual\u2019s privacy against the public\u2019s right to information, the company officials said. When Google\u2019s team accepts a request, it informs an individual that the privacy demand has been successful, while also notifying the website that links to certain European search results have been removed. The website cannot appeal the decision. If Google refuses the request, the company must tell an individual that the decision can be appealed, but does not specifically explain why the submission failed. Some European officials remain wary of handing Google the power to make privacy decisions, though they declined to comment publicly on the   privacy process. But regulators acknowledge that the company\u2019s system  \u2014   which has so far dealt with removal requests for 1. 4 million links  \u2014   has proved surprisingly straightforward. Some officials also remain satisfied that Google makes these initial privacy rulings despite a lack of openness over how decisions are made. \u201cWhen it comes to appeals, we agree with Google most of the time,\u201d said Mathias Moulin, a deputy director at the Commission National de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, the French privacy authority. This muted official response  \u2014   from both European regulators and politicians  \u2014   is partly because agencies lack the financial, technical and human resources to handle the substantial influx of \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests, according to regulatory officials and legal experts. Still, for privacy campaigners and some regulators, Google\u2019s regulatory track record remains outweighed by Europe\u2019s effectively handing the policing of one of its fundamental rights to a   company. \u201cIs Google the right entity to have such power over these decisions?\u201d said Johannes Caspar, supervisor at the Hamburg data protection authority, the primary regulator in Germany that oversees American tech companies such as Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and Facebook. \u201cWe have to live by European law, and that says Google must decide. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563654.7929187}
