It was Sept. 11. At the Victoria Beckham show  \u2014   held downtown not far from where many, including two presidential candidates, were gathering at National September 11 Memorial  Museum  \u2014   attendees observed the two moments of silence before the first model walked the runway. It was part of a formal recognition of how, every year, Sept. 11 falls somewhere on the New York Fashion Week calendar and how, for 15 years, designers and attendees have struggled with how to mark that day in an appropriate way. This year, for the first time, the Council of Fashion Designers of America blocked off the 9 a. m. time slot on the Fashion Calendar  \u2014   roughly the time the planes hit the Twin Towers  \u2014   in acknowledgment, and donated $15, 000 to the Sept. 11 museum. \u201cWe lived it, saw it, smelled it and refused to be defeated,\u201d Diane von Furstenberg wrote in an email, referring to New Yorkers who were in the city on that day. Ms. von Furstenberg, the chairwoman of the C. F. D. A. board, also noted the resilience: \u201cWe are not victims. We built a better building, an entire neighborhood. We are proud but we don\u2019t forget. Living fully is the only way to honor those who perished on that terrible day 15 years ago. \u201d In fact, in 2001, the World Trade Center was hit by the terrorist attacks just as that day\u2019s fashion shows were about to start in Bryant Park. At the time, the tragedy was met with confusion and uncertainty. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018What\u2019s happening with fashion week? Am I going to sneak in? \u2019\u201d said Humberto Leon, who had not yet founded Opening Ceremony and was still a fashion hopeful. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t know what was happening. I remember saying to somebody, \u2018No, nobody\u2019s going to have their show. \u2019\u201d Within hours, fashion week had been suspended, many shows canceled. Vogue and Carolina Herrera joined forces to offer some of the younger, fledgling brands the opportunity to show later, at Ms. Herrera\u2019s showroom. This year, throughout the day, front row chatter kept to the usual fashion week banter, about weather and logistics, but designers made acknowledgments in their show notes and programs, even if not aloud. \u201cWe have to,\u201d said Sander Lak, the designer of Sies Marjan. \u201cWe can\u2019t deny the fact that this is the 15th anniversary. \u201d He is a recent arrival to New York, unlike many others on the fashion week calendar who were living or working in the city in 2001. As a \u201cnew New Yorker,\u201d he said, he wanted to pay tribute to the occasion but did not think the shows should have been paused for the day. \u201cI think you should continue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should celebrate life, and beauty hopefully  \u2014   the joys of making things. \u201d Joseph Altuzarra, who had just come to the United States from Paris to attend Swarthmore College in the fall of 2001, said he felt conflicted at his show at 5 p. m. \u201cIn a way, I think it\u2019s a great message of rebuilding and going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also obviously a very sad day. It was really important for me in the program to address it. I feel dual emotions. It\u2019s sort of how I felt when I was watching the ceremony this morning. It\u2019s obviously incredibly sad, and there\u2019s a sort of positivity also that you hear about rebuilding. \u201d That message was echoed by Mr. Leon and Carol Lim of Opening Ceremony, who closed the day with an 8 p. m. show that was also a political pageant, urging action and optimism. \u201cWe were actually excited,\u201d Mr. Leon said of the overlap. \u201cIt made sense. We\u2019re doing a very celebratory act to commemorate it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562306.2781286}
