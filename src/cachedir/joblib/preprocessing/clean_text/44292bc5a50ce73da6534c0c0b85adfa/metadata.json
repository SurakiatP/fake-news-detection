But an orange talking STD has driven me to this recording studio! And now Moby is on the drums while Elizabeth Banks plays bass. So we can try to convince the USA not to shoot itself in the face.\u201d \\nAt this point in the game, if you haven\u2019t accepted that Donald Trump is a serial sexual predator who has made his entire business career off the backs of others and his entire political career off of appalling and un-American ethnonationalism who would destroy our economy and leave the world at the mercy of the predatory ambitions of dictators like Vladimir Putin, this song isn\u2019t going to convince you. But it\u2019s a fun little diversion that still hits home just how critical the result of this election is going to be. \\nWatch it here:'"}, "time": 1742562519.661279}
