[Noting that Germany received more than a million migrants in 2015 alone, the Algerian engineer and writer highlighted how former investment banker Macron \u201ctravelled to Berlin to pay tribute to Angela Merkel\u2019s welcome policy\u201d and warns Macron\u2019s approach to migration is \u201cdangerous\u201d.  Drawing attention to the globalist   president\u2019s declaration that \u201cthere is no French culture\u201d in her interview with Le Figaro   said he also has a \u201cblind spot\u201d with regards to integration policies. The engineer, who was a member of France\u2019s High Council of Integration, went on to contend there is \u201chardly any\u201d common ground between Macron and his   rival, Francois Fillon. \u201cFor one, French culture does not exist, when the other is part of a desire to continue France from a cultural point of view,\u201d the author of Decaying France told the broadsheet newspaper. \u201c[Macron has] repeatedly made clear the fact his line on these issues is globalist and multicultural, and so his positioning on migratory flows and French culture is coherent. \u201c[He sees France] as a country with open doors and windows, under the reign of a \u2018buffet culture\u2019 under which everyone places his and her dishes on the table and people only take what suits them. \u201d   also drew attention to remarks in which Macron described France\u2019s colonisation of Algeria as a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d writing that the   president\u2019s objective was to \u201cseduce\u201d voters of North African descent. But, noting the accusation \u201cis likely to pit different groups against each other\u201d she warns: \u201c[The comments were] extremely serious at a time when France is at war, targeted by terrorists who justify their acts with what [the nation] is and what it has been. \u201d   said Macron represents a continuation of the \u2018Terra Nova\u2019 strategy on the left, referencing the \u201cprogressive\u201d think tank whose name has become synonymous with a strategy in which minorities are encouraged to band together to fight against \u201can electorate that defends against change\u201d. Last year, Wikileaks revealed Macron, a former Rothschild banker, was working on an alliance with Hillary Clinton before her shock defeat in the U. S. presidential election. The globalist candidate had requested the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s presence at a private roundtable dinner in October with several European politicians, according to an email published by Wikileaks. Breitbart London reported Macron announced the world has entered an age of mass migration which will be inescapable for Europe. \u201cWe have entered a world of great migrations and we will have more and more of it [migration]\u201d he declared during a debate on climate change. And earlier this month, maintaining that the mass migration of people from the third world to Europe will only accelerate, the establishment favourite to win the election said immigrants are good for France and bring \u201cfresh bursts of creativity and innovation\u201d to society.'"}, "time": 1742564391.9646459}
