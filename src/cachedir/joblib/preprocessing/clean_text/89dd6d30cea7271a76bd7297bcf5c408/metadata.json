INSIDER\u2019\u2013 Manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of Trump presidency. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE\u2019s Shawn Helton) \\nThe Free Thought Project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated anti-Trump protests organized in part by by the George Soros NGO MoveOn: \\n\u201cWashington, D.C. \u2013 Billionaire globalist financier George Soros\u2019 MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump \u2014 exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation \u2014 and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. \\nWednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle , and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. \\nIn light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it\u2019s an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous.\u201d \\nSoros\u2019 affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: \\n\u201cAmericans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results \\nHundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. \\nTonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. \\nThe gatherings \u2013 organized by MoveOn.org and allies \u2013 will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trump\u2019s bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible. \\nWithin two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon.\u201d \\nSoros Agit-Prop Empire \\nLast year during the ongoing European migrant crisis, startling claims were levied by Hungarian PM Victor Orban (left photo), concerning the role played by Soros. \\nPM Orban contended that the founder and chair of Open Society Foundations (Open Society Institute), was entrenched in a \u201c circle of activists,\u201d that \u201cinadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network.\u201d \\nThe stunning declaration by Orban recalled the misguided machinations of \u2018The Occupy Movement\u2019 ( aka OWS) in 2011, as well as the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, along with other Black Lives Matter protests this past year \u2013 all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants (along with paid provocateurs) into violent action and social unrest. \\nBack in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It\u2019s worth mentioning, that MoveOn also supported the Obama campaign in 2008 and according to the website, Sanders was the only other candidate to reach the \u201cthreshold for an endorsement.\u201d \\nAs we said back in March, professional political agitator flash mobs, had been mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign \u2013 as \u2018activists\u2019 attempted to take away Trump\u2019s \u2018strength in numbers\u2019 at his rallies. This was confirmed at events in both Ohio, and at a Trump primary campaign event the University of Illinois Chicago earlier this year, where hundreds of BLM activists and Sanders supporters, triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage , shortly after Trump started speaking, then again at Reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort Trump away. \\nIn a Politico article in early 2016 entitled \u201c Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter ,\u201d we gained deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: \\n\u201cMajor donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,\u201d said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement.\u201d \\nIt worth noting how Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to \u201cboost\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign . Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump\u2019s rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond. \\nLook for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country \u2013 as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances. \\n\u2018SOCIAL ENGINEERING\u2019\u2013 Political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media, NGO\u2019s and social media. (Image Source: abc news ) \\nDuring the last month, it was revealed how investigative non-profit Project Veritas found evidence that the DNC paid participants to incite violence at Trump rallies during the course of the 2016 election. \\nIf those reports are accurate \u2013 reports which have gone unchallenged so far \u2013 this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also US criminal law. \\nPAID PROTEST?\u2019\u2013 Social justice warriors incite anti-Trump violence across the US. (Image Source: youtube ) \\nUSA Color Revolutions \\nBoth the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption, and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare. These political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions. Ultimately, a radical globalist and cultural marxist \u201cprogressive\u201d agenda is at play \u2013 eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial \u2018color\u2019 upheavals, and where possible \u2013 weakening a country\u2019s national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public\u2019s political perspective. \\nThis is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization \u2018color revolution\u2019 campaigns overseas , and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US. \\nOverseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. \\nInside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org , as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week\u2019s protests. \\nIt still remains to be seen if Trump\u2019s stated dynamic political vision for America can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world, in addition to helping economic woes at home, or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism. This remains to be seen. \\nCertainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s total silence over their own party\u2019s role in fomenting this week\u2019s unrest \u2013 one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable \u2013 to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency. \\nBut one thing is for sure \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the 45th president and the public should question why. \\nLegal Action Against Soros Groups \\nIn a recent report featured at RT news we learn that George Soros and BLM activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge: \u201cThe father of the Dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a Black Lives Matter protest is suing the organization\u2019s activists and George Soros for $550 million . In a separate suit a Baton Rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a BLM protest. \\nThe father of Patrick Zamarripa filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and other groups for allegedly \u201cinciting a war on police\u201d that led to the death of his son. \\nThe lawsuit filed in US District Court in Dallas on Monday seeks $550 million in damages. \\n\u201cWhile Defendant Black Lives Matter claims to combat anti-black racism,\u201d the lawsuit said, according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram, \u201cthe movement has in fact incited and committed further violence, severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities, Jews, and Caucasians. Defendant Black Lives Matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang.\u201d \\nThe misguided machinations behind the anti-Trump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the president-elect. Will these protest groups be a reboot of the OWS movement, occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into 2017 and beyond? \\nMore from the Duran below\u2026 \\n\u2018NEO BLACK BLOC?\u2019\u2013 Black bloc provocateurs, have violently escalated protest movements since the 1980\u2019s, all the way through 2011\u2019s Occupy Wall Street Movement and beyond.
