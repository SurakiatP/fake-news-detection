Terry McAuliffe of Virginia used his executive power on Friday to restore voting rights to more than 200, 000 convicted felons, circumventing the   legislature. The action effectively overturns a Civil   provision in the state\u2019s Constitution aimed, he said, at disenfranchising  . The sweeping order, in a swing state that could play a role in deciding the November presidential election, will enable all felons who have served their prison time and finished parole or probation to register to vote. Nearly half are   a core constituency of Democrats, Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s political party. Amid intensifying national attention over harsh sentencing policies that have disproportionately affected   governors and legislatures around the nation have been debating  \u2014   and often fighting over  \u2014   moves to restore voting rights for convicted felons. Virginia imposes especially harsh restrictions, barring felons from voting for life. In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin, a newly elected Republican, recently overturned an order enacted by his Democratic predecessor that was similar to the one Mr. McAuliffe signed Friday. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, vetoed a measure to restore voting rights to convicted felons, but Democrats in the state legislature overrode him in February and an estimated 44, 000 former prisoners who are on probation can now register to vote. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we\u2019ve had a horrible history in voting rights as relates to    \u2014   we should remedy it,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said in an interview Thursday, previewing the announcement he made on the steps of Virginia\u2019s Capitol, just yards from where President Abraham Lincoln once addressed freed slaves. \u201cWe should do it as soon as we possibly can. \u201d Republicans in the Virginia Legislature have resisted measures to expand voting rights for convicted felons, and Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s action, which he said was justified under an expansive legal interpretation of his executive clemency authority, provoked an immediate backlash. Virginia Republicans issued a statement Friday accusing the governor of \u201cpolitical opportunism\u201d and \u201ca transparent effort to win votes. \u201d \u201cThose who have paid their debts to society should be allowed full participation in society,\u201d said the statement from the party chairman, John Whitbeck. \u201cBut there are limits. \u201d He said Mr. McAuliffe was wrong to issue a blanket restoration of rights, even to those who \u201ccommitted heinous acts of violence. \u201d The order includes those convicted of violent crimes, including murder and rape. There is no way to know how many of the newly eligible voters in Virginia will register. \u201cMy message is going to be that I have now done my part,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said. Nationally, an estimated 5. 85 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions, according to The Sentencing Project, a Washington research organizations, which says one in five   in Virginia cannot vote. Only two states, Maine and Vermont, have no voting restrictions on felons Virginia is among four  \u2014   the others are Kentucky, Florida and Iowa  \u2014   that have the harshest restrictions. Friday\u2019s shift in Virginia is part of a national trend toward restoring voter rights to felons, based in part on the hope that it will aid former prisoners\u2019   into society. Over the last two decades about 20 states have acted to ease their restrictions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. In Kentucky, Mr. Bevin, who took office in November, promptly overturned an executive order issued by his predecessor, Steven L. Beshear, just before he left office. Then, last week, Mr. Bevin signed into law a less expansive measure, allowing felons to petition judges to vacate their convictions, which would enable them to vote. Previous governors in Florida and Iowa took executive action to ease their lifetime bans, but in each case, a subsequent governor restored the tough rules. Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, said Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s decision would have lasting consequences because it will remain in effect at least until January 2018, when the governor leaves office. \u201cThis will be the single most significant action on disenfranchisement that we\u2019ve ever seen from a governor,\u201d Mr. Mauer said, \u201cand it\u2019s noteworthy that it\u2019s coming in the middle of this term, not the day before he leaves office. So there may be some political heat but clearly he\u2019s willing to take that on, which is quite admirable. \u201d Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of a voting rights project at the Brennan Center, said Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s move was particularly important because Virginia has had such restrictive laws on voting by felons. Still, she said,\u201cCompared to the rest of the country, this is a very middle of the road policy. \u2019\u2019 Ms. P\u00e9rez said a number of states already had less restrictive policies than the one announced by Mr. McAuliffe. Fourteen states allow felons to vote after their prison terms are completed even while they remain on parole or probation. Advocates who have been working with the Virginia governor say they are planning to fan out into Richmond communities Friday to start registering people. Experts say with the stroke of his pen, Mr. McAuliffe has allowed convicted felons to begin registering to vote, and that their voting rights cannot be revoked  \u2014   even if a new governor rescinds the order for future released prisoners. But the move led to accusations that the governor was playing politics he is a longtime friend of  \u2014   and   for  \u2014   Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee for president, and former President Bill Clinton. In the interview, Mr. McAuliffe said that he was not acting for political reasons, and that few people outside his immediate staff knew of his plan. He said he did not consult with Mrs. Clinton or her campaign before making the decision. The executive order builds on steps the governor had already taken to restore voting rights to 18, 000 Virginians since the beginning of his term, and he said he believed his authority to issue the decision was \u201cironclad. \u201d Prof. A. E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia School of Law, the principal draftsman of a revised Constitution adopted by Virginia in 1971, agreed, and said the governor had \u201cample authority. \u201d But Professor Howard, who advised Mr. McAuliffe on the issue, said the move might well be challenged in court. The most likely argument, he said, is that the governor cannot restore voting rights to an entire class of people all at once. Virginia\u2019s Constitution has prohibited felons from voting since the Civil War the restrictions were expanded in 1902, as part of a package that included poll taxes and literacy tests. In researching the provisions, advisers to the governor turned up a 1906 report that quoted Carter Glass, a Virginia state senator, as saying they would \u201celiminate the darkey as a political factor in this State in less than five years, so that in no single county of the Commonwealth will there be the least concern felt for the complete supremacy of the white race in the affairs of government. \u201d Mr. McAuliffe, who took office in 2014 and campaigned to restore voting rights to felons, said that he viewed disenfranchisement as \u201ca remnant of the poll tax\u201d and that he had been \u201ctrying to figure out what more I can possibly do. \u201d The governor\u2019s action Friday will not apply to felons released in the future his aides say Mr. McAuliffe intends to issue similar orders on a monthly basis to cover people as they are released. \u201cPeople have served their time and done their probation,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said. \u201cI want you back in society. I want you feeling good about yourself. I want you voting, getting a job, paying taxes. \u2019\u2019'"}, "time": 1742562049.3316038}
