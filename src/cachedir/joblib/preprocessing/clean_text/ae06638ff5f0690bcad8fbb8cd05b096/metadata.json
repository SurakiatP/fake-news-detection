[The Mercury News reported that two California lawmakers Friday introduced legislation to replace private insurance with a   health care system covering all 38 million Californians \u2014  including its undocumented residents.  \u201cWe\u2019ve reached this pivotal moment,\u201d Sen. Ricardo Lara (  Gardens) told the Mercury News in an interview Friday, \u201cand I thought to myself: `Look, now more than ever is the time to talk about universal health care. \u2019\u201d The article went on to report that the proposal dubbed the \u2018Healthy California Act\u2019 introduced by Lara and former Assembly Speaker, now State Senator Toni Atkins, (  Diego)  \u2014   was submitted just before the deadline for new legislation \u2014  and for such a sweeping proposal, it remarkably short on specifics. Atkins said in a prepared statement obtained by Mercury News, \u201cIn light of threats to the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s important that we are looking at all options to continue to expand and maintain access to health care. The Healthy California Act is an essential part of that conversation. \u201d After a week that has brought California\u2019s crumbling infrastructure into focus \u2014  as back to back storms threatened the nation\u2019s tallest dam in Oroville, California, and forced Gov. Brown to request Federal Emergency Funds from President Trump \u2014   Brown and Democrat legislators have come under scathing criticism for squandering money on benefits for illegal aliens and public sector unions at the expense of   infrastructure. Only California Democrats would launch a new social program with no specific details or any identifiable funding source in a state that is perpetually broke, and where ObamaCare is unpopular with over 46% of voters \u2014  including a lot of Democrats.
