She answered, \u201cI think it\u2019s more what our country is about. We have criticized other countries that said we utilize you as a workforce, but you\u2019re not fully present in our country. In my view, it\u2019s very important for us to say the path to citizenship is the dignity that these people  \u2014  . \u201d She added, \u201c[I]f it\u2019s something that forbids citizenship, no, I couldn\u2019t sign on to that. If we want to talk about  \u2014   I think there are plenty of ways we can work in a bipartisan way on immigration.
