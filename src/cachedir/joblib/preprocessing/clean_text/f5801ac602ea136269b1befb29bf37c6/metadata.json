[\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Donald Trump, but I am so tired of hearing celebrities talk about not being a fan of Donald Trump, that it almost seems like white noise,\u201d Thomas said in an interview with The Hill. \u201cI think that he\u2019s a man that\u2019s not really equipped for the job, but I think no one really cares what I think about that. \u201d  \u201cI have opinions, but my opinions are as a    husband, father, taxpayer. No matter what I say, they always kind of come across as a guy who sings music and it\u2019s always, \u2018Well you need to shut up! \u2019\u201d the   singer continued. Thomas also acknowledged that a large part of Trump\u2019s base thinks the president is \u201ckilling it right now,\u201d and said it would be difficult to criticize them despite his own political opinions. The \u201cLonely No More\u201d singer was a featured speaker Tuesday at the American Society for Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Foundation\u2019s ninth annual \u201cWe Write the Songs\u201d event at the Library of Congress. Thomas has been advocating on behalf of songwriters, whom he claims are being robbed of their royalties by big businesses that take advantage of antiquated federal regulations. \u201cAmerican songwriters, composers and music publishers are some of the most   small business owners and entrepreneurs in the country because   of the income that songwriters receive is subject to federal regulation,\u201d Thomas wrote in an   published Wednesday at Quartz. \u201cAnd you better believe the big,   Wall   music streaming companies are happy to take advantage of these regulations to pay songwriters less than fair value for their work and are actively fighting updates to these regulations so they can continue to build their businesses on the backs of songwriters,\u201d he added.
