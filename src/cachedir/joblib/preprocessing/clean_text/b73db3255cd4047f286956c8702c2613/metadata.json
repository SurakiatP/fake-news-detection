Sundberg\u2019s hands were allegedly being held behind her back by Varona, FiberOne reported. The suspects and the material witnesses drove her to a rest area alongside a highway, according to the police report. Varona was seen kicking the back of one of her legs, forcing her to the ground. Rodriguez then allegedly shot her at least 13 times in the head. After shooting the woman, Mendez Villenueva reportedly wrote a note in Spanish on a piece of carboard and placed it on her back. He secured the message in place by stabbing it into her back with a knife, the report obtained by FiberOne revealed. The group then fled the scene, traveling to a convenience store where they purchased some beer. The Pacific Northwest has experienced crime from foreign nationals in the past.
