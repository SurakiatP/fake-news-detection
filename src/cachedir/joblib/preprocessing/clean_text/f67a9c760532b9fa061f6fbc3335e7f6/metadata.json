He made fun of me, and I didn\u2019t know how to respond. He told me I was ugly. I was massive. He called me names. He called me Miss Piggy, Miss Housekeeping, Miss Eating Machine\u2026.For years, afterward, I was sick fighting back eating disorders.\u201d \\nMachado added, \u201cIt\u2019s clear. It\u2019s really clear that he does not respect women. He just judges us on our looks.\u201d \\nIt is smart to take every opportunity to remind voters that as a human being, Donald Trump has consistently behaved in public like trash. He is a man who hates women and treats more than half of the population like objects. \\nHaving Machado introduce Clinton in Florida was also savvy politics. Trump has never demonstrated the personal restraint needed not to take the bait. Machado\u2019s comments should cause Trump to blow up again, and throw his dire campaign even further off message. \\nHillary Clinton is setting Trump with a masterful trap. No one has been better at feeding negative Trump news cycles than the candidate himself. Trump can\u2019t resist defending himself, and Hillary Clinton is setting the Republican nominee up to open his mouth and wallow in his own sexist mud.'"}, "time": 1742563968.187939}
