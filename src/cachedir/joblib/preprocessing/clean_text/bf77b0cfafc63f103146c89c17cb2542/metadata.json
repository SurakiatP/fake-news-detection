The immediate trigger for the sanctions, which drew from a list of targets drawn up last year by the Obama administration, was Iran\u2019s missile test last Sunday. The exact details of the test remain shrouded in considerable mystery. But the way the two countries jabbed at each other  \u2014   with the White House saying it would \u201cno longer tolerate Iran\u2019s provocations that threaten our interests,\u201d and Iranian state news media vowing retaliation  \u2014   had distinct echoes of the darkest days before the July 2015 nuclear accord was reached. In striking that deal 19 months ago, the Obama administration was gambling that, over time, Washington and Tehran would learn how to manage their differences and cooperate on one or two discrete projects, starting with eliminating the Islamic State. But that era never arrived. And with the announcements on Friday, it became clearer than ever that leaders in both countries now see an advantage in taking a hard line  \u2014   each betting that the other does not have the stomach for a risky, expensive confrontation. \u201cThe danger is that this is the first stage in an escalation that could culminate in a military confrontation between Iran and the United States, or Iran and Israel,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThe entire eight years of the Obama administration was an example of unprecedented but largely unreciprocated overtures for cooperation with Iran in the Middle East. The Iranians weren\u2019t interested. And now, the Iranians sense the rest of the world would not line up with the Trump administration. \u201d The sanctions themselves are unlikely to have a significant effect on Iranian action. They strike at specific companies and arms traders from Iran to Lebanon and China. Mr. Obama took similar steps a year ago, after another Iranian missile test. But by and large, his administration tried to   tensions  \u2014   and at one point even assured European banks that, under the nuclear deal, they were free to resume transactions with Iran without fear of American retaliation. In announcing the new sanctions, the White House made clear that it planned to call out every violation, and respond. The Treasury Department took the unusual step of describing the inner workings of three networks that produce technology for Iran around the globe, in an effort to expose front companies and signal a new level of pressure on Tehran. \u201cThe international community has been too tolerant of Iran\u2019s bad behavior,\u201d said Michael T. Flynn, the president\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cThe ritual of convening a United Nations Security Council in an emergency meeting and issuing a strong statement is not enough. The Trump administration will no longer tolerate Iran\u2019s provocations that threaten our interests. \u201d Kate Bauer, a former Treasury official who is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the sanctions and the announcements surrounding it were \u201ca way to take back the narrative, to declare that this is not a \u2018  era. \u2019\u201d \u201cBy providing so much public detail about the networks that feed Iran\u2019s missile program,\u201d she said, \u201cthey will cause significant disruption. \u201d Even inside the White House it is unclear how much further, beyond sanctions, President Trump is willing to take the confrontation. While he suggested during his campaign that he might scrap the nuclear deal, which he described as a \u201cdisaster,\u201d both his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, made clear during their confirmation hearings that the world was better off with the accord, for the next decade at least, because of its prohibitions on Iran amassing enough enriched uranium or separated plutonium to manufacture even a single nuclear weapon. The Iranians have largely complied with every provision of the deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which conducts regular inspections of the nuclear facilities. When small violations have been found, the Iranians have quickly rectified them, including by shipping fuel out of the country. But nothing in the nuclear agreement deals with Iran\u2019s support of Hezbollah or other terrorist groups, or its missile testing. A United Nations Security Council resolution, also negotiated in Vienna as the nuclear accord was being completed, calls on Iran to show restraint in testing, and prohibits test flights of a missile that could carry a nuclear warhead. Iran maintains that none of its missiles are designed for that purpose, though outside experts note it would be fairly easy to alter one to fit a warhead. It is unclear exactly what Iran was testing last weekend. Its missile traveled about 600 miles before its   vehicle exploded. That may have been accidental, or an intentional detonation. Reports in Germany have suggested that a cruise missile  \u2014   harder to strike with missile defenses  \u2014   was also launched, but American officials have not confirmed that. But in both Washington and Tehran, the test itself was clearly less important than the symbolism of the moment. Mr. Trump wanted to demonstrate he would not tolerate even minor infractions of Iran\u2019s commitments. For their part, the Iranians wanted to demonstrate that they would continue any activity not specifically prohibited by the nuclear accord, and would not be intimidated. On Friday, hours after the sanctions were announced, the Foreign Ministry in Tehran promised to impose \u201clegal restrictions\u201d on an unspecified number of American individuals and entities  \u2014   in effect, a retaliatory blacklist. Since Americans are already prohibited from doing business in Iran, it was far from clear what they had in mind. In a statement carried on state television, the ministry said the identities of the American targets would be announced later, and that those targeted \u201cwere involved in helping and founding regional terrorist groups. \u201d That appeared to be a response to a part of the sanctions aimed at Iran\u2019s support for various proxy forces in the region, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen. A senior administration official called Iran\u2019s moves \u201cdestabilizing. \u201d Asked whether the administration believed Iran controlled everything that Houthi rebels were doing in Yemen, he conceded that Tehran may not make every tactical decision but said it arms and supports the rebels. He said that the sanctions were \u201cinitial steps in response to Iranian provocative behavior. \u201d The official spoke at a briefing for reporters under rules, set by the administration, that prohibited naming those conducting it. Democrats did not criticize the sanctions, and even some former members of the Obama administration said they saw value in pushing back against the Iranians. But Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, warned against provoking Iran into further action. \u201cI urge the administration to bring clarity to their overall strategy towards Iran, and to refrain from ambiguous rhetoric  \u2014   or provocative tweets  \u2014   that will exacerbate efforts to confront those challenges. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628534.438553}
