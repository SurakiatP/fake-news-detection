I knew we were headed towards communism when the American electorate chose Clinton, not once, but twice. I knew because I\u2019d gone to high school with Bill Clinton\u2019s wife, Hillary Clinton, and I knew her politics. It frightened me, but I thought we could recover. With the election of Obama, not once, but twice, we are now truly a communist nation. There are barely any threads of the Republic left to grab onto and the nation still sleeps. If we don\u2019t awaken the \u201csleeping giant\u201d soon, the Gulags of Russia will become an American reality. KJLN \\nA Russian government official bragged that Barack Obama was a KGB operative and that his presidency had been planned since birth, an American physicist and government contractor reports. Tom Fife, an American computer networking specialist and international businessman, reported the alarming facts about the Kremlin\u2019s connection to Barack Obama. The boast from a Communist Party official reportedly occurred during a business trip to Russia,16 years before Barack Obama was ushered into the presidency of the United States. \u201cIt was like an elastic band snapping all the way from 1992,\u201d Fife shakily admitted, upon recall of the exact moment he realized the Communist official had been telling the truth. \\n\u201cIt was a very, very scary feeling.\u201d \\nFife, a physicist and computer engineer, had been traveling to Russia for a joint venture with a state-owned company when the shocking revelation was revealed to him. After several business meetings, Fife and his partner were invited to the company owner\u2019s home at the end of the journey for a farewell dinner. \\nThe owner\u2019s wife was a Communist Party official and was \u201cclimbing two ladders\u201d, as Fife puts it, one ladder being the KGB and the other being the traditional Russian society and business ladder. As the evening wore on, the female Communist official became increasingly agitated over a perceived slight and her emotions spilled over. \\n\u201cYou Americans like to think you\u2019re so perfect!\u201d she snarled. \u201cWell, what if I told you that very, very soon you\u2019re going to have a black president\u2026 and he\u2019s going to be a Communist!\u201d \\nThe KGB operative was not finished. As she had now dropped this bombshell on the entire gathering, she felt compelled to continue. \\n\u201cHis name is Barack,\u201d she sneered. \u201cHis mother is white and his father is an African black. He has gone to the best schools, he is what you would call \u2018Ivy League\u2019.\u201d \\nFife recalls being stunned and shocked at the words flowing from the Communist\u2019s mouth as she continued to rattle off an incredibly precise set of details about this Communist operative who was to supposedly become president of the United States. \\nThe Communist official then stated that he was from Hawaii, but would very soon be elected to the Chicago state legislature. This has turned out to be an eerily prescient prediction, as Barack Obama was not elected State Senator until 1996, a full 4 years afterwards, as he took Alice Palmer\u2019s seat. \\nIn 1992, Obama had recently graduated from Harvard Law School and accepted a position as a Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School. Perhaps the most shocking revelation is how deep the Soviet Communist network has embedded itself into American political and educational culture. A quick review of Obama\u2019s political \u201ccareer\u201d shows a track that was inexplicably greased, from his tuition payments at Columbia and Harvard, to a position at UOC Law School, to his eventual electoral \u201cvictories\u201d at the Illinois State Senate, United States Senate, and U.S. Presidency. \\nBarack Obama\u2019s parents ostensibly met in a Russian language class. This could have been where his mother was recruited by Barack Obama Sr, who could have already been working undercover for the KGB. In order to brainwash the child from an early age, they surrounded him with diehard Communists and fellow KGB agents, such as Frank Marshall Davis, a known Communist Party USA official. The Soviet KGB directly funded the CPUSA. This would fit directly into what the Russian Communist said about \u2018Barack\u2019, boasting \u201cHe has been raised to be an atheist and a communist.\u201d \\n\u201cHe will be a blessing for world communism,\u201d Fife recalled her saying, after getting over the initial shock of hearing the current president was a KGB agent. The creepy prediction stayed with the physicist upon his return to the United States, although he paid it no mind until he began to hear of a swiftly rising political star named Barack Obama. When Fife learned that this same Barack was running in the2008 presidential election, everything snapped into place and he knew he had to tell someone. Today, Fife admits that it deeply disturbs him and that he has never been able to shake the ominous feeling of foreboding about what comes next, now that the KGB official\u2019s prediction has come true. \\n\u201cIt never leaves you, having someone tell you that they\u2019ve engineered the takeover of your country,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite scary.\u201d \\nSee also Dr. Eowyn\u2019s May 24, 2010\u2019s post on this, \u201c Obama, A Sleeper Agent For World Communism .\u201d Rate this:'"}, "time": 1742561989.0581427}
