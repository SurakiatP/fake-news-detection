[Tripp says she was prompted to go public about the issue in response to the NBC comedy sketch show\u2019s negative portrayal of President Donald Trump and top White House officials. She charged the show and the mainstream news media were engaged in a deliberate \u201ccampaign of disinformation, confusion, and essentially propaganda. \u201d  Tripp also opened up about the personal toll she said the media\u2019s negative portrayal had on her, describing how she banned television from her house for three years in the late 1990\u2019s and at times engaged in binge eating as a coping mechanism. She was speaking on this reporter\u2019s weekend talk radio program, \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio,\u201d broadcast on New York\u2019s Am 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. In the interview, Tripp divulged she has been quietly writing a book about her experiences working directly adjacent to Hillary Clinton\u2019s second floor West Wing office, where Tripp was afforded a front row seat into some of the most infamous scandals to rock the Clinton White House, misdeeds that she says partially prompted her to finally go public about the Lewinsky affair.  She explained she was also motivated to go public to protect Lewinsky. SNL \u2018Had an Agenda\u2019 During the Clinton administration, Tripp first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside Bill Clinton\u2019s Oval Office. After three months, Tripp was asked to work for the White House Counsel\u2019s office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons for their infamous alleged misdeeds.  Tripp\u2019s office was located adjacent to Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Tripp documented evidence of Lewinsky\u2019s phone calls about her relationship with Bill Clinton and submitted the evidence to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair. Throughout the scandal, SNL repeatedly depicted Tripp, played by Goodman, as a wrongdoer who betrayed her friend by recording conversations with the younger Lewinsky in a bid to land a book deal, even though Tripp never published a book. In a previous interview on my show, Tripp explained she went public because she believed her own life and Lewinsky\u2019s were in danger, saying that Lewinsky was threatening Clinton with outing the relationship. During our interview on Sunday, Tripp commented on the SNL portrayals of her. \u201cI had always been a great fan of John Goodman,\u201d Tripp said. \u201cI think he is funny. And actually, in the beginning I thought his portrayal was funny. But over time, I came to realize that there was more there than comedy alone. \u201d Tripp recalled SNL comedian Dana Carvey \u201cdid just amazing impersonations of President Bush. But it was just good clean fun. Much the way you saw Obama portrayed on Saturday Night Live. \u201d \u201cAnd this was different,\u201d she said, referring the show\u2019s portrayal of her.  \u201cIt had an agenda. It had a focus. And it was a means to an end. And the means to an end was to use any and all opportunities to discredit and to vilify me.   \u2026     What happened to me and what is happening today frankly is something completely different and scary. \u201d Tripp continued: \u201cMany people don\u2019t know this, but as soon as the (Lewinsky) story broke, Hillary Clinton is documented as saying, \u2018Get me anything and everything on Linda Tripp.\u2019 Which I knew she would do. They couldn\u2019t discredit me professionally because they had promoted me many times over the time that I was in the White House. So, they were lost on that score. So, they had to make me into a villain. \u201d She took issue with the show\u2019s framing of her as the offender. \u201cQuite apart from being a betrayer, I believe I helped Monica Lewinsky. But the real issue is how the Clinton machine in conjunction with the media portrayed me as evil repeatedly. And frankly I don\u2019t present well photographically so I helped them. \u201d Tripp subsequently said she found it interesting that liberals espouse \u201chollow claims to champion civil rights of all, want the federal government to assign gender neutral bathrooms, but were okay with SNL portraying me as a transgender villain. Their PC protections only apply to liberals. \u201d Media Coverage of Trump \u2018A Sabotage of the Truth\u2019 Meanwhile, Tripp said during Sunday\u2019s interview that she sees SNL\u2019s current negative portrayal of Trump and top administration officials, including Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway and White House Spokesman Sean Spencer, as part of a larger news media campaign aimed at discrediting the president and his policies. \u201cNow I think what is going on on SNL is a part of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all of a piece, though. It\u2019s almost a psychological warfare tactic. I worked with special operations for many years. And I can\u2019t overstate the effectiveness of this campaign that they are waging. \u201cYou have to understand that the media backed one candidate. And after she was defeated and after a campaign where the   mainstream media, which is a true misnomer, advocated essentially as an arm of the DNC. After her defeat, they have done nothing but double down in an attempt to take down what they perceive as their opponent. Because he had the nerve to actually win. When, if you will recall, virtually everyone in the mainstream media laughed on air about even the possibility of his winning. \u201d Tripp called the rampant   media coverage a \u201ccampaign of disinformation, confusion, and essentially propaganda. \u201d \u201cIt is a sabotage of the truth. And it\u2019s on a grand scale. And for me it is painful to watch because even though the president has a bully pulpit, even he is at the mercy of what people refer to as the mainstream media. A private citizen has no chance. But even the president will face obstacles because this is an orchestrated effort. \u201d Mocking Took a Personal Toll, Tripp described how SNL\u2019s mocking and the larger negative coverage in the news media caused her to go into hiding, created body image issues, and led to binge eating as a coping mechanism. \u201cI know that I went into hiding,\u201d she stated.  \u201cI know that I have never been a vain person. I kind of have always been a pretty straightforward person. I have never obsessed about my looks. I guess I have never been that much of a girly girl. So, I was stunned at how I looked number one in the pictures. \u201d \u201cRealizing that I had deteriorated in such an extreme way in my years following my exposure to the Clintons. And that is kind of how I cope. I eat myself into oblivion and it shows when I can\u2019t deal on any level with what I am seeing. \u201cI took TVs out of my house. We didn\u2019t have TV in my house for a good three years. Because I couldn\u2019t bear to see all the negativity and all the untruths. And it was a helpless feeling because as a private citizen you have virtually no chance at all to defend yourself. They can create the monster that they choose to create. And you are literally helpless to combat that. \u201d One of many examples of SNL\u2019s targeting of Tripp was a skit jeering Tripp\u2019s February 1999 interview with   reporter Jamie Gangel. In the skit, the mock Gangel stated: \u201cMiss Tripp, no one understands, no one. No one understands why you did what you did. You betrayed your friend by taping private current phone conversations. \u201d Tripp\u2019s character, played by Goodman, replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that. Not because I think it was a horrible, gutless, soulless thing to do but apparently, it\u2019s against the law in the state of Maryland. And they want to prosecute me for it. Big time. \u201d \u201cDo you feel bad about what you have done?\u201d asked Gangel\u2019s character. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d Goodman replies, as Tripp. \u201cYou went out of your way to betray a friend\u2019s confidence. To end a relationship between two consenting adults and in the process caused an investigation that cost the American taxpayer tens of millions of dollars all in the hopes of getting a book deal. \u201d \u201cWell,\u201d retorted Tripp\u2019s character, \u201cif you put it that way no. I did what I did because I\u2019m a patriot. As a New England Patriot. I\u2019m their new starting outside linebacker. \u201d Far from that characterization, Tripp said on Sunday she documented evidence of Lewinsky\u2019s phone calls in order to help Lewinsky. Speaking last September on my show, Tripp made similar remarks. She stated at the time: I say today and I will continue to say that I believe Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made and action I took. That may sound melodramatic to your listeners. I can only say that from my perspective I believe that she and I at the time were in danger, because nothing stands in the way of these people achieving their political ends. I think that had it not become public when it did, particularly in light of the Paula Jones lawsuit, which was coming to a head with President Clinton\u2019s deposition, that we may well have met with an accident. It\u2019s a situation where unless you lived it as I did you would have no real framework of reference for this sort of situation. Book, Tripp revealed during the interview that she has been working on a book for the past five years. Besides the Lewinsky issue, her front row seat during her White House days afforded her access to some inside stories on the scandals known as Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater, and she says she personally witnessed the handling of documents from Vince Foster\u2019s office the morning after the Deputy White House Counsel was found dead in an apparent suicide. Tripp stated the book would contain her \u201cversion of what happened and what caused me to go forward and the motivation that propelled me forward in the face of overwhelming obstacles. \u201d \u201cI mean you just do not go up against the president of the United States for frivolous reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly, not for a book. I do think it may be time to put it out in the public domain. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
