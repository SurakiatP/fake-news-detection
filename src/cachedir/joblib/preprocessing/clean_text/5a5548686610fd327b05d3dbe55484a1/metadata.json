While the deaths have crossed the unpardonable mark of 300, the Govt. as usual, continues to undercut the number to less than the half of the actual deaths. Even taking the official figure of 121 deaths, it an extremely serious case and calls for an urgent, comprehensive action, in a situation when state apathy and delay have been primary reasons for these avoidable deaths on such a large scale. \\nWe are indeed shocked that the \u2018Team of Experts\u2019 sent by the Centre has tried to absolve the Government of all responsibility by attributing the deaths to consumption of some local seeds (Bana Chakundi) and not to JE and governmental delay, thereby blaming the adivasis themselves for the deaths! When as per the Orissa Govt\u2019s statistics, itself 32 cases are \u2018confirmed JE\u2019, there out to have been remedial medical response on a war-footing considering the seriousness of JE, which can be fatal or can lead to life-long intellectual, behavioral or neurological impairments in many cases. It is also a serious question as to why the Govt. did not ensure timely incorporation of JE immunization in the public health delivery, as per WHO standards and remained in denial mode. The extremely casual response of the medical department, State Govt. and now even the Centre through this \u2018Expert Team\u2019 only demonstrates that even in this time of crisis, the concern is more their \u2018onus\u2019 and \u2018image\u2019 than the life of the children. \\nPublic Health Expert Dr. Sylvia Karpagam in her reasoned counter to the Centre\u2019s report questions that when the so-called toxic seeds are consumed all round the year and by all families in the tribal region, since generations, it is intriguing as to why this epidemic erupts here only on children and why now. One likely reason might be that the presence of JE, in the already malnourished children, could have been aggravated by the consumption of the seeds, in some cases. But for the Central Team to take a generalized and extrapolated position on the basis of only 5 urine samples (out of 121 official, admitted death) is certainly not a scientific way of medical research or does it appear convincing in the present circumstances. Many other experts as well have questioned the Central team\u2019s unilateral conclusions, merely on the basis of toxicity in the urine samples, especially since JE cases and deaths have been reported across the district even in the Malkangiri town. \\nIt is also pertinent to note that the Expert team has remained completely silent on the crucial role (or failure) of the anganwadis and ICDS monitoring system in the state in providing nutritional and health support to children in the tribal areas. This is despite the fact that the Apex Court has, time and again attached highest priority to ensure health and nutrition in all the tribal tracts and hamlets across the country, in the form of hot cooked meals. This situation is clearly in violation of the orders of the Supreme Court in the Right to Food Case (Civil Writ Petition No. 196/2001). In fact, one has to only go through the fact finding reports by Right to Food Campaign in Malkangiri districts conducted in 2012 as well as 2016. The abysmal situation of Public Health Infrastructure and Food Distribution systems are one of the main reasons behind the regular outbreak of JE disease. The rampant malnutrition, under staffed public health institutions, abysmal health infrastructure are providing the perfect breeding ground for outbreak and spread of the disease. It is indeed ironical that while on the one hand the Union Ministry of Women and Child Welfare is pushing for packaged foods and gearing up to sign Corporate MoUs, in violation of SC\u2019s norms, on the other the anganwadis and ICDS servises in many areas of Malkangiri or elsewhere, especially in tribal areas seem to be utter disarray. \\nIn the light of this serious situation, NAPM: CALLS UPON the Centre and State to declare this as a medical emergency and ensure anti JE-immunization and other medical relief on a war-footing. DEMANDS an independent enquiry into this crisis by a multi-member team comprising of renowned public health professions, independent health activists and doctors. \\nCALLS UPON the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to immediately take cognizance of the situation and their team, including Commission members and medical experts to investigate the causes, recommend immediate measures and speed up action on the ground. \\nCALLS UPON the Governor of Orissa to make an immediate visit to the affected areas as the constitutional custodian of peace and good government for the tribal areas and ensure relief and justice to the adivasi children and families. \\nAPPEALS to the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court to immediate take up this matter in the ongoing Right to Food case (Civil WP 196/2001) and issue directions to the State and Centre and also monitor the proceedings before the Orissa High Court in the ongoing PIL against the JE. \\nAPPEALS to all progressive activists, students, the national media and pro-people medical experts to reach Malkangiri to assist the adivasis in whatever way possible, establish the scientific and true reasons of the scale of deaths, intervene to ensure immediate medical assistance and press for accountability of the state agencies and other actors involved. \\nMedha Patkar \u2013 Narmada Bachao Andolan and the National Alliance of People\u2019s Movements (NAPM); Aruna Roy, Nikhil Dey and Shankar Singh \u2013 Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan and National Campaign for People\u2019s Right to Information, Prafulla Samantara \u2013 Lok Shakti Abhiyan & Lingraj Azad \u2013 Samajwadi Jan Parishad \u2013 Niyamgiri Suraksha Samiti, NAPM, Odisha; Dr. Sunilam, Aradhna Bhargava \u2013 Kisan Sangharsh Samiti Suniti SR, Suhas Kolhekar, Prasad Bagwe \u2013 NAPM, Maharashtra; Milind Champanerkar, Editorial member, Andolan Magazine, Pune; Gabriele Dietrich, Geetha Ramakrishnan \u2013 Unorganised Sector Workers Federation, NAPM, TN; C R Neelkandan \u2013 NAPMKerala; P Chennaiah, Ramakrishnam Raju, Meera Sanghamitra, NAPM Telangana-AP, Arundhati Dhuru, Richa Singh, Nandlal Master \u2013 NAPM, UP; Sister Celia \u2013 Domestic Workers Union & Rukmini V P, Garment Labour Union, NAPM, Karnataka; Vimal Bhai \u2013 Matu Jan sangathan & Jabar Singh, NAPM, Uttarakhand; Anand Mazgaonkar, Krishnakant \u2013 Paryavaran Suraksh Samiti, NAPM Gujarat; Kamayani Swami, Ashish Ranjan \u2013 Jan Jagran Shakti Sangathan & Mahendra Yadav \u2013 Kosi Navnirman Manch,NAPM Bihar; Faisal Khan, Khudai Khidmatgar, J S Walia, NAPM Haryana; Kailash Meena, NAPMRajasthan; Amitava Mitra & Avik Saha, NAPM West Bengal; Bilal Khan, Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan, Mumbai, Bhupender Singh Rawat \u2013 Jan Sangharsh Vahini & Rajendra Ravi, Madhuresh Kumar, NAPM, Delhi \\nAlso endorsed by: Dr .Mohan Rao MBBS, PhD , Professor, Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, School of Social Sciences , Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi Share this:'"}, "time": 1742628459.3209553}
