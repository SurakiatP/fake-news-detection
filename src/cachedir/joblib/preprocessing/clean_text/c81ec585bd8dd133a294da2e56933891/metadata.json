No, no, the   drink of winter 2016, at least according to a small but dedicated circle of food blogs, is red wine hot chocolate. A post this fall on Martha Stewart\u2019s official Facebook page called it \u201cspectacular. \u201d Soon after, Cosmopolitan magazine called it \u201cthe best of both worlds. \u201d The Kitchn, a popular recipe site, called it \u201cthe answer to your   blues. \u201d And last month, The Daily Mail had an \u201cexclusive\u201d on a version of the recipe that had grown popular on Pinterest. The basic idea is not new. Most versions follow the same formula as the one posted in 2014 on Imma Eat That, a food blog that has frequently been cited as the recipe has rocked around the internet in the past few years. It\u2019s pretty easy to follow: Depending on your thoughts on hot chocolate, on red wine and on the trend of mixing two separate foods together in heretofore unimagined and occasionally unholy ways, this sounds like either the best idea or the worst idea. And when you can already easily add rum or whiskey or any other spirit to hot chocolate, what else can red wine really bring to the table? The first reaction most people had when they heard about this story? A crinkling of noses and the occasional \u201ceww. \u201d It was definitely mine. The key is to start with a good hot chocolate, said Jacques Torres, a New York pastry chef whose public identity is so fused with chocolate that he is known as \u201cMr. Chocolate. \u201cYou\u2019re going to use real chocolate,\u201d he said, not cocoa powder, and warm it with milk and a bit of condensed milk for extra silkiness. \u201cFinished chocolate has all the flavor you want,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s smooth and silky it doesn\u2019t have any bitterness. \u201d Mr. Torres also suggested an important deviation from most of the recipes out there: Do not heat up the wine and the chocolate together. Make your hot chocolate and separately make some mulled wine only then should the two be combined. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get the spices, it\u2019s not going to be that good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it can be good with the spices. \u201d He suggested mulling the wine with allspice, and ancho and chipotle chiles \u201cso you have a little bit of heat with it. \u201d And so one cold Sunday I set about making this strange Frankendrink. I followed Mr. Torres\u2019s advice, using two especially dark chocolate bars for the hot chocolate. The mulled wine was a simmered mix of what was on hand: orange slices and sugar, water and an entire bottle of cheap red wine (I used a $9 malbec, minus a glass for drinking just in case this whole chocolate thing didn\u2019t work). Allspice, cloves, star anise and cinnamon rounded it out. And then I stood facing two simmering pots of liquid that my brain was still screaming should not be combined. Wine is good, I told myself. Hot chocolate is good. So both went into a mug, were stirred together and topped with a marshmallow. And it was absolutely delicious.'"}, "time": 1742628598.4877107}
