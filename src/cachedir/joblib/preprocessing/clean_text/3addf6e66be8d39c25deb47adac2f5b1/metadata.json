[\u201cMeryl Streep, one of the most   actresses in Hollywood, doesn\u2019t know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes,\u201d Trump writes on Twitter. \u201cShe is a Hillary flunky who lost big. \u201d  Streep accused of Trump making fun of a disabled reporter, lamenting that the event \u201csank its hooks in my heart. \u201d \u201cIt kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can\u2019t get it out of my head because it wasn\u2019t in a movie it was real life,\u201d she said. But Trump argued that he was simply showing the reporter \u201cgroveling\u201d for changing a 16 year old story to make him look bad. \u201cJust more very dishonest media!\u201d he concluded. Streep vocally supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign, and boldly celebrated that she would be the first woman president in a DNC convention speech.  \u201cYou\u2019re gonna make history again in November. Because Hillary Clinton will be our first woman president. And she will be a great president,\u201d Streep said at the time. \u201cAnd she will be the first in a long line of women. And men. Who serve with grit and grace. \u201d In June 2016, Streep also did an unflattering Trump impression during a performance at the Public Theater Gala, as she smeared a spray tan on her face and sang for the audience.  She also gave a tribute speech to Hillary Clinton during a 2012 Women in the World summit.  In December 1, 2012, Streep snapped selfies with Hillary Clinton as she prepared another run for president. During her Golden Globes speech, she fretted that Trump would make the country worse. \u201cDisrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose,\u201d she warned. \u201cDisrespect invites disrespect\u201d Meryl Streep pic. twitter.   \u2014   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) January 9, 2017, '"}, "time": 1742628375.0392973}
