They will have to find new coverage in a market that will likely have fewer options and higher prices, Bloomberg reported Friday. \\nThe coverage losses come after Aetna and UnitedHealth Group, as well as some regional insurers, announced they plan to leave Obamacare\u2019s markets in 2017 and instead offer individual coverage outside of the program\u2019s exchanges.That means there will be fewer, but more expensive, plans, and the same doctors and hospitals people used before may not be included under the Affordable Care Act, regulators and insurance customers told Bloomberg. \\nUtopian vision: healthcare for all. \\nReality: Americans are fined if they don\u2019t have health insurance. If they do have health insurance through Obamacare, they could lose it. And, it wasn\u2019t that good to begin with. \\nSee, that\u2019s the problem. Liberals always think the plans will work. \\nThere will be no bumps, no issues. Where did my unicorn go? \\nBut as Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini explains, \u201cproviding affordable, high-quality health care options to consumers is not possible without a balanced risk pool\u201d and many insurers agree\u2013they\u2019re \u201chaving trouble competing in Obamacare marketplaces and making money.\u201d \\nIt is predicted that for the first time in three years, Obamacare enrollment will shrink in 2017. The potential 1.4 million that will lose their health care next year will have fewer and costlier options. \\nMichael F. Cannon, a health policy expert at the Cato Institute, summed it up nicely: \u201cthe ongoing and nationwide exodus of insurers is just the latest piece of evidence that Obamacare is a failed law built on false promises.\u201d \\nI couldn\u2019t have said it better myself.'"}, "time": 1742628416.2531123}
