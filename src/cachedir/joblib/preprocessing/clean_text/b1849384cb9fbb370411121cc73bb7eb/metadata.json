[The video posted to Lakshmi\u2019s Instagram page is a compilation of supposed victories of the   protests that have appeared across the country. The video states, \u201cThink protesting doesn\u2019t change anything? In the last 48 hours the resistance has won major victories. \u201d  The video then takes credit for the rejection of Betsy Devos by two GOP senators, the cancellation of Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the   company, however Trump did meet with two   executives and Nordstrom cutting ties with Ivanka Trump\u2019s company despite Nordstrom explicitly stating that no boycott affected their decision to cut ties with Ivanka\u2019s company. The video then states, \u201cBerkeley protesters forced the cancellation of a hate speech by   Milo. \u201d The video fails to mention that innocent people were pepper sprayed, beaten with bats and chased by angry mobs or that the protest quickly devolved into a full blown riot with masked rioters destroying ATM\u2019s and Starbucks shops. A video posted by Padma Lakshmi (@padmalakshmi) on Feb 4, 2017 at 7:00am PST,  The video also fails to mention MILO\u2019s explicit rejection of white supremacy, white nationalism or any form of racism during a speech at UC Colorado Springs, \u201cWhite pride, white nationalism, white supremacy isn\u2019t the way to go,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe way to go is reminding them and yourselves that you should be aspiring to values and to ideas. \u201d \u201cYou should be focusing on what unites people and not what drives them apart,\u201d MILO concluded. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give a shit about skin color, a shit about sexuality  \u2026     You shouldn\u2019t give a shit about gender, and you should be deeply suspicious of the people who do. \u201d MILO will be appearing on Justice with Judge Jeanine tonight at 9PM ET on Fox News.'"}, "time": 1742628492.2159078}
