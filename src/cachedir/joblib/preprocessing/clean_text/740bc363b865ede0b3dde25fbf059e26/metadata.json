She also gives her perspective on God and her Mission: \u201cPoor us. poor kids who come to volunteer; we have such a difficult time ahead of us, a real fight. I am here to help my family \u2018wake up,\u2019 EVERYONE is sleeping.\u201d \\nCathy\u2019s Mother: \u201cMy nine-year-old daughter speaks \u2018star languages\u2019 to heal water. I live in Northern Europe and have four children. At the time of my first pregnancy, a \u2018voice\u2019 told me my children were not mine. They would only come through me. These children belong to no one. It wasn\u2019t until recently that I was aware there were such things as extra-terrestrials. My nine-year-old daughter is a special girl who finds the conventional world and rules difficult. She asks me why isn\u2019t she allowed to do things her own way. Cathy has healing abilities and dictated some healing words in an ET language to purify water. I noticed the water actually tasted different afterward. She says that star languages are from a place outside of the Universe. \\nCathy receives messages in ET languages and understands what they are saying to her. She says that they are important. \\nI showed her your presentation, where a woman does healing and writes several ET languages. My daughter responded with joy and excitement, \u2018She knows what I have written\u2019.\u201d \\nAstounding as Cathy\u2019s claim may be, a scientist from Northern Europe is researching ways to energize water and explains how this could be possible. \\nDr. Ohlson (Ph.D.) is a Swedish scientist referred to previously as coining the term letter people.. She is also studying water and its properties. Humanity Has to Believe in Itself: \\n\u201cIt is difficult, because first of all, we don\u2019t believe it, then if we believe but still have doubts, this prevents us from reaching this potential. We have to be at a point within ourselves to get in touch with our REAL truth in order to achieve this. \\n\u201cThere is a certain time we will achieve it, and if one person does, it will spread to other people, and this is the way it will start. But at what time I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d \\nCathy shares why the star kids have come to this planet at this time: \\n\u201cThe star kids have come to show us the way. They are the ones to start the process, helping the rest of humanity to wake up.\u201d \\nCathy says she is from Evening Land, to help us evolve. When her purpose is accomplished, she will go to the Day Light. We have already been in Day Land, but because we wanted to have more experiences, we came to this planet. \\nThe beings in Contact with her, like Emenoke, do not live on another planet. They are located at the \u2018edge of the universe\u2019 in the White Light. \\n\u201cThe \u2018light orb\u2019 is sent to protect us. My little brother has a blue orb that protects him.\u201d \\nMary: \u201cYou said he will also be a teacher \u02d7 in what way?\u201d \\nCathy: \u201cHe will be my teacher, as I will be, and he will be home schooled so he will retain true knowledge.\u201d \\nM: \u201cWhat do your guides teach you?\u201d \\nC: \u201cThey are teaching me different knowledge so I can teach adults. The danger is that it can be changed and then the true information is lost. Then people get confused and lost by making fun of the star children, or not believing them. Many Star Kids are destroyed by education.\u201d \\nM: \u201cHow many star kids are there?\u201d \\nC: \u201cForty or fifty percent of people of a hundred, but many get lost and only twenty percent will remember who they are.\u201d \u201cWe Have to Wake Up!\u201d \\n\u201cThe beings want us to wake up and see reality as it is, to understand how powerful we really are. Some individuals from Day Land and Evening Land have come here to help humanity with the Awakening. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous to come here to help because our past life memories can be deleted at birth and some of this is destroyed by society and education, drink and drugs. Those who come here are aware of the dangers and still want to come and help. We are not awake yet.\u201d \\nM: \u201cHow can we wake up?\u201d \\nC: \u201cWe have to increase our energy as we don\u2019t have the energy required; it\u2019s stolen from us.\u201d \\nM: \u201cHow can we protect our energy?\u201d \\nC: \u201cAt present, we only have point five percent (.05%) of our energy. We need to have one point five percent (1.5%). \\nHow might we begin to increase our energy? Cathy says: Don\u2019t get angry about small things. Don\u2019t speak on mobile phones for a long time. Don\u2019t eat white sugar. Don\u2019t watch TV. Don\u2019t use microwaves. Don\u2019t have wireless internet.\u201d 3 5 \\n\u201cSomething important will happen in the next five years on this planet. The parents have to listen to us. We need to educate the parents.\u201d \\nAn Excerpt from the forthcoming book The New Human by Mary Rodwell About Raven Raven Fon is a freelance writer and a globetrotting journalist.
