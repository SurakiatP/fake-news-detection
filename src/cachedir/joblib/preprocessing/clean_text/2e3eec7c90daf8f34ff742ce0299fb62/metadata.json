No surprise, its biennial has grown up, too. Perhaps less expected: So has the art in it. This show\u2019s strength and focus make it doubly important at a time when art, the humanities and the act of thinking itself seem under attack in Washington. The 2017 Biennial, the first held in the expansive Renzo   structure on Gansevoort Street, is an adult affair: spatially gracious to art and visitors alike, and exceptionally good looking, with an overall mood of easy accessibility. My first thought: It needs a little more edge. Yet this show navigates the museum\u2019s obligations to a broader public and its longtime   audience with remarkable success. Organized by Christopher Y. Lew, the Whitney\u2019s associate curator, and Mia Locks, an independent curator, it has some immature inclusions and other letdowns. But once you really start looking, there\u2019s edge all over the place. The show spotlights 63 artists and collectives working at the intersection of the formal and the social, and in this it announces a new chapter of   political art  \u2014   though one already brewing in small museums, galleries and studios. Many of these artists confront such American realities as income inequality, homelessness, misogyny, immigration, violence, hatred and biases of race, religion and class. But they are equally committed to the artistic exploration of media and materials, and to the creation of bold and strange things to see and think about. Important messages are conveyed through perception. Take Henry Taylor\u2019s gripping history painting of Philando Castile dying in the passenger seat of his car in a St. Paul suburb, having just been shot by a policeman whose gun, arm and uniform are visible through the car window. We are inside the car, in the driver\u2019s seat, bearing witness with Diamond Reynolds, Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, as she   his mortal injury on a cellphone. Mr. Castile, a school cafeteria manager, has the noble head of a Greek bronze, complete with a jawline beard and an eye whose flat whites the Greeks would have made from silver or alabaster inlay. His shirt is spattered with paint, not blood. Mr. Taylor\u2019s style is harsh but it doesn\u2019t overplay. Samara Golden\u2019s \u201cThe Meat Grinder\u2019s Iron Clothes\u201d is a dystopian combination of mirrors and eight   miniature interiors  \u2014   including some upside down  \u2014   that create endless kaleidoscopic reflections of class conflict. Overlooking the Hudson River, it includes a drab office full of computer stations, an   aspirational Upper East Side living room and some merging of   hospital and prison featuring pink wheelchairs and filthy toilets. The melding of pleasure and horror it can elicit would have delighted Georges Bataille, the radical philosopher for whom \u201ctruth has only one face: that of a violent contradiction. \u201d This Biennial follows the lead of Kerry James Marshall\u2019s painting retrospective at the Met Breuer last fall, which set a high standard for social engagement sustained by formal ambition. This presentation is also an important bookend to the 1993 Biennial, a raucous, untidy show unforgettable for the   issues it threw in viewers\u2019 faces  \u2014   and for often overly didactic, hectoring and visually dry art. The current Biennial reflects the emergence of artists committed to political subject matter but unwilling to limit themselves artistically or to lecture viewers. Mr. Marshall, who presides here in absentia, has lots of company. Some of the breathtaking openness and diversity of contemporary art is evident in this show\u2019s participants and its range of media  \u2014   from painting, which is plentiful and mostly but not entirely figurative, to digital and   art. Nearly half are female, and half nonwhite its demographics argue that not only do black lives matter (along with Hispanic, Asian, Muslim and immigrant lives) they are essential to our quality of life  \u2014   physical, emotional, cultural, linguistic, economic, educational, environmental. The show is promising from the start, in the lobby, which is festooned with 10 opulently embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d banners by Cauleen Smith, a Chicago artist whose work is also in the film program. Serious yet melodramatic, they contrast statements of stark deprivation (\u201cI Cannot Be Fixed\u201d) with images of exposed hearts weapons burning eight balls broken pencils and a large, injured eye, conjuring faith, superstition, violence and thwarted expression. The intensity grows in the gallery off the lobby, where Rafa Esparza, of Los Angeles, has inserted \u201cFigure Ground: Beyond the White Field,\u201d a magical circular room (and floor) made of adobe bricks. It is in, but not of, the museum, and Mr. Esparza has invited five artists not officially in the Biennial to exhibit their work here, most notably Beatriz Cortez, whose    \u201cCairn,\u201d assembled from large chunks of volcanic rock, is a fragile balancing act that speaks volumes about the precariousness of life today. The two main floors of the show, five and six, each begin with a large figurative painting. On the fifth floor, Dana Schutz\u2019s \u201cElevator,\u201d commissioned by the museum, is a weak, scattered reprise of a smaller, better painting in her last gallery show. Two smaller Schutz works here are stronger: \u201cShame,\u201d a study in contorted female   and especially \u201cOpen Casket,\u201d based on a famous photograph of Emmett Till, young, murdered and disfigured, in his coffin. Ms. Schutz doesn\u2019t picture his wounds as much as the pain of looking at them. On the sixth floor, the opener is Mr. Taylor\u2019s ambitious \u201cAncestors of Ghenghis Khan With Black Man on Horse,\u201d a   canvas. It lacks the clarity of the Philando Castile painting (whose furious title is \u201cThe Times Thay Aint a Changing, Fast Enough! \u201d) or \u201cThe 4th,\u201d a canvas of a black man at a backyard grill that has the heft of an official royal portrait from centuries past. The large gallery that Mr. Taylor\u2019s paintings share with Deana Lawson\u2019s meticulous   photographs  is one of the show\u2019s best. Like Mr. Taylor, Ms. Lawson addresses the dangers, contradictions and cultural richness of living in America as a black person. She does so by extending the staged efforts of photo artists like Jeff Wall and Stan Douglas but with slightly smaller, more insistent color images. Showing black people at home, they imply the ties and tensions of family and friendship and smolder with quiet determination. The ambiguous \u201cSons of Cush,\u201d revolving around two men, a tiny baby and a fist full of cash, is as full of symbols as a Renaissance painting. The show is punctuated with other smart, mutually enhancing pairings. On the fifth floor, the colorful paintings of Shara Hughes push natural forms toward feverish abstraction using the Fauves and early American modernists like Charles Burchfield. These analog visions sync up with the digital ones, directly adjacent, of Anicka Yi\u2019s \u201cThe Flavor Genome. \u201d This gorgeous     video alternates between the Amazon rain forest and a pristine lab to tell a fictive story of \u201cbioprospecting\u201d in the name of global consumerism. On the Hudson side of the sixth floor, Jessi Reaves\u2019s alternately raw and beautiful hybrids of found furniture and sculpture provide both seating and ingenious commentaries on design, modernism and waste. Their snarling energy is matched by their neighbors: the creepy coagulations of color, plastic, resin, drawing and grommets that form the paintings of KAYA, a collaboration consisting of the artists Kerstin Br\u00e4tsch and Debo Eilers. Some artists approach the unvarnished bluntness of the 1993 Biennial, with complexity. \u201cA Very Long Line\u201d  \u2014   a   video installation by the collective Postcommodity involving blurry images of tall fences shot from a moving car  \u2014   takes over the walls of a small gallery, capturing the viewer in a noisily rattling cage. When you learn that the fences are on the Mexican border, the piece becomes a visceral metaphor for the experience of feeling, or being, trapped, that is now the fate of so many undocumented immigrants. Jordan Wolfson\u2019s \u201cReal Violence\u201d provides a   view of a brutal   assault  \u2014   real violence that many Americans rarely see. Horrible to watch, it should at least shock almost anyone into a better understanding of how scarring it is to witness physical savagery. \u201cReal Violence\u201d finds an apt foil in the discombobulated sculptures of Kaari Upson in the same gallery: urethane casts of severely damaged couches   shades of red, silver and pink that suggest bodies at once powerful and pathetic. Impressively, the show\u2019s \u00e9minence grises are showing some of the best work of their careers. Larry Bell contributes \u201cPacific Red II,\u201d a majestic line of six large   volumes made from progressively lighter or darker sheets of red laminated glass that combines East Coast and West Coast Minimalism as never before. The weird symbolism in Jo Baer\u2019s paintings fuse the grays of her early Minimalist abstractions with visions of Irish myths and monuments. Other efforts deserving attention include the bravura abstract paintings of Carrie Moyer, among her best, and the gritty figurative ones of Celeste  . The choreographer Maya Stovall offers videos of modern dance on Detroit sidewalks, vividly juxtaposing art and life. Tuan Andrew Nguyen\u2019s video \u201cThe Island,\u201d an unlikely combination of fact and fantasy, revisits the tiny Malaysian island of Pulau Bidong, which sheltered tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees who fled their country in the 1970s and \u201980s. Pope. L\u2019s enormous room covered inside and out with a careful grid of embellished slices of baloney, embodies his usual sarcasm, even if the point about population breakdowns remains obscure. Oto Gillen\u2019s fugal   show \u201cNew York, 2015  \u2014  \u201d documents the denizens of our sanctuary city\u2019s public spaces  \u2014   homeless people, food vendors, police officers, bike messengers  \u2014   presenting a combination of striving and defeat (and surveillance). Providing contrast are shots of the luminous nocturnal beauty of skyscrapers under construction that will do nothing to succor the lives below. At the other end of the exhibition, Asad Raza\u2019s \u201cRoot sequence. Mother tongue\u201d brings brief respite: 26 young, often flowering trees facing the flickering light of the city. At a moment when a new president threatens to wipe out the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, this exhibition makes an exciting, powerful case for art. As seen here, art illuminates the diversity on which this country\u2019s greatness stands and  \u2014   through its mysterious alchemy of beauty and reality, tragedy and joy  \u2014   inspires us to think, know our better selves and fight back. 1. What\u2019s playing during Jordan Wolfson\u2019s violent   demonstration? A Hebrew prayer or blessing sung upon the lighting of the candles during Hanukkah. 2. How many times is Donald J. Trump\u2019s name mentioned? Twice. 3. How many artists not chosen by the curators are exhibiting in the show? A total of 42, in installations by Rafa Esparza (5) John Riepenhoff (7) and Occupy Museums (30). 4. How many of the 63 artists live in Los Angeles or New York City? 38. 5. How many of the New Yorkers live in Brooklyn? About 11. 6. What is the classroom on the fifth floor? It\u2019s a working classroom, set up by the Puerto Rican artist Chemi   to serve students of the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy on the Lower East Side. The students come to the museum for lessons the school displays work from Biennial artists. 7. What\u2019s with those raggedy circles drawn on the wall of each floor? The exhibition graphics were inspired by the Biennial catalog design by Tiguere Corporation, in San Juan, P. R. which includes   circles with slashes as a   element. The graphics appear on floors that include Biennial works. The single slash means \u201cthis floor has some Biennial works\u201d and the double slash or X means \u201cthis entire floor has Biennial works. \u201d 8. Why are cheap foam Statue of Liberty crowns in the gift shop? It\u2019s an addition from Puppies Puppies, the pseudonymous artist also responsible for a performance on the eighth floor: On weekends, a performer dressed as the Statue of Liberty appears on the Whitney\u2019s highest balcony.'"}, "time": 1742563034.4669797}
