[Gabriel is the Nick Clegg to Angela Merkel\u2019s David Cameron, with his Social Democratic Party (SDP) propping up her administration serving as the junior partner in her coalition government. He has butted heads with the German chancellor repeatedly in recent weeks, in an apparent attempt to put some distance between them in advance of this year\u2019s federal elections.  \u201cI once asked the chancellor, what would be more costly for Germany: for France to be allowed to have half a percentage point more deficit, or for Marine Le Pen to become president?\u201d Gabriel told Der Spiegel, as reported in EurActiv, referring to the populist leader of the French nationalists, who has won increasing support through her strong opposition to mass immigration and radical Islam. \u201dUntil today, [Merkel] still owes me an answer. \u201d The Saxon politician appeared to be indicating that he would like his senior partner to relax the rigid fiscal rules which govern the European Union\u2019s (EU) single currency zone, although he conceded that any proposal to transfer money from Germany to the Eurozone\u2019s struggling periphery would be \u201cextremely unpopular\u201d. As of late 2015, Germany had gained some 100 billion euros (\u00a370 billion) from the euro crisis which has been crippling countries such as Greece, discouraging any inclination for Berlin to veer from the status quo. \u201cBut I also know about the state of the EU. It is no longer unthinkable that it breaks apart,\u201d he added. \u201cShould that happen, our children and grandchildren would curse us,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause Germany is the biggest beneficiary of the European community  \u2014   economically and politically. \u201d Gabriel has also clashed with Merkel over mass migration, arguing for Salafist mosques to be shut down, their preachers deported, and communities dissolved. It was a surprising   by the socialist, who was calling for Germany to take \u201chalf a million\u201d migrants a year for \u201cseveral years\u201d and \u201cmaybe more\u201d prior to election season.'"}, "time": 1742561943.647883}
