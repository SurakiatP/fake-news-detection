I\u2019ve been excited about this film since Dwayne Johnson previewed it last year at the D23 Expo for all things Disney. As much as the new   Miranda music sounds promising, what\u2019s really exciting is the chance to see a Disney princess who doesn\u2019t look like those we have already. I was already aging out of the children\u2019s movie demographic when my mom took us to see Robert Rodriguez\u2019s \u201cSpy Kids\u201d in 2001. Yes, it was a silly story: Children turn into spies to save their   agent parents. But my sister and I became obsessed. The suave   father was played by Antonio Banderas with a pronounced Spanish accent. The children were named Carmen and Juni (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) and the implication was that they were   or   Americans. As a daughter of Cuban immigrants who once struggled with her accent, I had never seen characters who looked or sounded like us as the heroes of their own story. \u201cSpy Kids\u201d is still one of the few positive examples I hold onto, 15 years later. I\u2019m not alone. There are many nonwhite women and girls who don\u2019t see movie characters who look the way they do, and the omission can affect their  . That\u2019s why the issue of diversity in movies for young people is just as important as pushing for inclusion across Hollywood, both behind, and in front of, the camera. So much of nonwhite representation in cinema is trivial at best, stereotypical at worst  \u2014   the wisecracking sidekick or the background player stuck there as a token. I remembered feeling that something was amiss about Tito the Chihuahua in Disney\u2019s \u201cOliver   Company\u201d (1988). Why did the only dog with a Mexican accent (voiced by Cheech Marin, who has a less embarrassing part in \u201cSpy Kids\u201d) have to   cars? I wanted to see more of the mechanic tomboy Audrey Ramirez (Jacqueline Obradors) in \u201cAtlantis: The Lost Empire\u201d (2001) and wished I could forget that \u201cCars\u201d (2006) has a barely visible lowrider named Ramone (Mr. Marin, again) that happens to be the only vehicle in Radiator Springs with hydraulics. I forgot that \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Groove\u201d (2000) was set in the Inca Empire, because none of the main voice actors (David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton) sounded as if they spoke our language. Yet one of the   videos in our home was \u201cThe Three Caballeros,\u201d a Disney animated guide to South America from 1944. Donald Duck is the American protagonist, joined by the Mexican rooster Panchito (Joaquin Garay) and the Brazilian parrot Jos\u00e9 (Jos\u00e9 Oliveira) on a   tour of Latin America. More than just a Technicolor spectacle (akin to \u201cFantasia,\u201d in terms of trippy animated musical sequences) \u201cThe Three Caballeros\u201d was a cultural explainer that didn\u2019t entirely reduce our stories to cheap tropes. As an indirect product of the Good Neighbor Policy, by which the United States invested in South American ties, the movie had incentive to avoid negative portrayals. When it came to Disney princess movies, my sister and I had very different experiences. It was always easier to find a princess who looked the way I do, because I was born with much paler skin than anyone in our family. My younger sister, Cristina, didn\u2019t decide to be Jasmine from \u201cAladdin\u201d during playtime friends assigned her the character. Back then, that was the animated figure that looked closest to her, and she didn\u2019t have many others to choose from. Luckily, the Disney renaissance of the 1990s gave us many more diverse heroines to treasure. Cristina adored Pocahontas\u2019s free spirit and modeled herself on the strong Mulan. But they often weren\u2019t the main princesses featured in Disney advertising or merchandise. And once their movies faded from store shelves, so would the dolls and the rest of their products. In those days, the newer princesses weren\u2019t stocked   like those of the classic era: Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora from \u201cSleeping Beauty. \u201d In this sense, \u201cMoana\u201d is another step in the right direction. Native Hawaiians are entering a rarefied pop culture circle, inclusion in a movie that will reach viewers around the world. Considering how women, and especially women of color, are rarely shown as leaders onscreen, this is no small victory. The evolving arc of Disney princesses  \u2014   from the damsel in distress Snow White in 1937 to the entrepreneurial dreamer Tiana in \u201cThe Princess and the Frog\u201d in 2009  \u2014   gives hope that we\u2019ll see more animated stories starring young female characters who look as if they could be from anywhere around the world. Then again, no tickets have been sold to a Disney movie starring a Latina princess. She doesn\u2019t exist yet. The company started a TV show, \u201cElena of Avalor,\u201d about such a character, but that series lacks the production values and marketing heft of a   movie. It seems like a halfhearted concession to Latinas  \u2014   half a Disney princess  \u2014   but it\u2019s more than other girls still waiting to see themselves on the big screen have received. There are many still waiting for a \u201cMoana\u201d to call their own, a movie to pass on to their children that speaks to them about their culture. My sister ended up working for a few months this year as a performer at one of Disney\u2019s theme parks. After several frustrating auditions, she was told she was too dark to play any character not covered in fur. She tried out to greet guests as Elena of Avalor, and she received the same answer: too dark. (She ended up playing characters while fully covered in costumes.) Not even as an adult does she fit in Disney\u2019s kingdom. But I\u2019m hoping that those days are numbered, and that she and other women and girls like her will never have to feel as if they didn\u2019t belong in the Happiest Place on Earth.'"}, "time": 1742564328.5422466}
