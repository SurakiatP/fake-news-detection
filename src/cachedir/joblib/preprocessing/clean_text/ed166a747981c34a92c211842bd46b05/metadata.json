Did anyone listen to his speech in Gettysburg, PA?He said, as a contract, and I quote, \"a constitutional amendment to OPPOSE term limits on all members of congress.\"I think he meant IMPOSE, but he is a business man that works with wording of contracts.I tried to find more information on his website, but there is no reference to it.I like Trump, it was a tough choice between Giant Meteor and Trump, but in the end, I voted early for Trump (AZ).What he is asking to do is change the constitution, which we should never take lightly.In this video on this website at ruffly the 16 min 40 sec mark, is says \"constitutional amendment to OPPOSE term limits on all members of congress\"I even turned on the CC function and it took it as OPPOSE too.The media is reporting it as IMPOSE, but that\\'s not what he said.I was wondering if anyone has direct reference from Trump\\'s camp.THX'"}, "time": 1742628415.4987283}
