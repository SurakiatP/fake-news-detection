What\u2019s not hard to believe is that the environmental health implications of the spill are stubbornly lingering. \\nGulf residents of variety of species are paying a high price for it \u2014 so high that litigation against BP for its role in the spill, officially deemed \u201c negligent ,\u201d is likely to continue for decades as people fight to get help with ongoing medical expenses. \\nLast year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the spill was linked to an uptick in dolphin deaths , illustrating that this unprecedented release of petroleum products in the Gulf had a lasting health impact for animals. \\nSimilarly, abnormalities in heart development among fish have also been connected to Deepwater Horizon exposure. Part of the problem is that sediments remain coated in oil and sludge . Because it was impossible to clean up every drop of crude from the Gulf, the oil that settled to the bottom continues to interfere with the embryonic development of a range of fish species. \\nBut humans aren\u2019t doing too well either. \\nIn the aftermath of the spill, people were exposed both to crude petroleum and to Corexit , a chemical dispersant used in unprecedented volumes during the cleanup. \\nSubsequent research has shown that in addition to having some hazardous health effects on its own, the combination of Corexit and the type of crude spilled during the Deepwater Horizon incident packs a hefty punch for marine animals. \\nIn the weeks following the spill, first responders reported symptoms like rashes, respiratory problems, headaches, seizures and depression. In response to the complains, agencies closely monitored these individuals. \\nAs the years went by, enough significant health problems arose for a class action lawsuit against BP.
