However, the 3 judges are demanding that this ancient law must be implemented otherwise the price of their wigs will become too expensive because of import duty and German rascals pumping up the prices in Euro\\'s as the GB Pound sinks out of trace! \\nThey are demanding that parliament must stop Brexit negotiations immediately! They have also asked the Scots and Northern Irish to organise referendums so they can eventually purchase their wigs via Edinburgh or Belfast because Scots are determined to stay in Europe even if they have to rebuild Hadrian\\'s Wall! \\nNigel Farage\\'s wig is wearing out rapidly, and being the mega-hypocrite that he is, ordered a new set of wigs from Herr Dummkopf, Made in Germany, before Mrs May eventually plunges the UK into an abyss that they will never get out of! Working class wig wearers don\\'t give a wank because they wear cheap imitations from China and are only interested in cheap booze drying up in Calais!
