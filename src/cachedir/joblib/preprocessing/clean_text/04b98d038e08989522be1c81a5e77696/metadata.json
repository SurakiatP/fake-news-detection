In a document marking the conclusion of the church\u2019s yearlong  Jubilee of Mercy, the pope extended a policy of allowing priests  \u2014   and not only bishops or special confessors  \u2014   to grant forgiveness for abortion, which the church considers a sin. The announcement was a signal of the pope\u2019s vision of a more welcoming, merciful and inclusive church. While firmly restating his opposition to abortion as \u201ca grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,\u201d the pope affirmed that \u201cthere is no sin that God\u2019s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father. \u201d The document, an apostolic letter, was signed on Sunday after a Mass denoting the end of the jubilee year. It was made public on Monday. Pope Francis\u2019 decision last year, at the start of the jubilee, followed in the footsteps of Pope John Paul II, who granted priests the same right during the previous holy year, in 2000. Under canon law, abortion brings automatic excommunication unless the person receiving or performing it confesses and receives absolution. Abortion is considered a \u201creserved sin,\u201d meaning that permission to grant forgiveness usually must come from a bishop. Bishops could already delegate the authority to grant absolution to parish priests  \u2014   and many bishops in the United States had done so  \u2014   but the practice varied widely by country and even by diocese. In parts of the world, observant Catholics who have sought absolution for abortions have faced delays at times, or even rejection. In some places, priests have been delegated the power to absolve abortions during certain times of year, like Lent, Archbishop Rino Fisichella, the president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization, said at a news conference at the Vatican on Monday. \u201cNow that right is extended to all priests,\u201d he said, noting that changes would have to be made to canon law to reflect the new practice. The decision underscores the pope\u2019s idea of a church that leaves nobody outside its doors, and the apostolic letter calls on the clergy and the world\u2019s 1. 2 billion Catholics to reflect, and to act, upon the message at the heart of the yearlong meditation on mercy. In the document, a blend of religious teachings and acute social commentary, \u201cPope Francis delineates the path of the future life of the church so that it can always be an instrument of mercy toward everyone, without ever excluding anyone,\u201d Archbishop Fisichella said. The archbishop said that the apostolic letter offered guidelines to priests who were called on to exercise forgiveness, referring to an April proclamation on family life that, among other things, created a path for divorced and remarried Catholics to receive holy communion. Francis\u2019 letter also noted that the church would celebrate a World Day of the Poor every November \u201cto help communities and each of the baptized to reflect on how poverty is at the very heart of the Gospel. \u201d He also called on the faithful to \u201cpromote a culture of mercy based on the rediscovery of encounter with others, a culture in which no one looks at another with indifference or turns away from the suffering of our brothers and sisters. \u201d At a ceremony naming 17 new cardinals on Saturday, the pope warned against what he described as a \u201cvirus of polarization and animosity. \u201d He said that \u201cin God\u2019s heart there are no enemies,\u201d and chided those who \u201craise walls, build barriers and label people. \u201d The comments were seen by some Vatican observers as a rebuke to calls by   Donald J. Trump to build a border wall and to restrict Muslims from entering the United States. Pope Francis did not single out any country, but he has expressed dismay over the harsh tone on immigration that Mr. Trump has taken. In February, the pope suggested that Mr. Trump was \u201cnot Christian\u201d because of the campaign promise to build a wall on the United   border. (Mr. Trump, who is not Catholic, called the pope\u2019s admonishments \u201cdisgraceful. \u201d) The pope on Saturday denounced the tendency to treat \u201ca stranger, an immigrant or a refugee\u201d as the enemy, warning that such thinking invited hatred. \u201cLittle by little, our differences turn into symptoms of hostility, threats and violence,\u201d he said. Harassment and violence against immigrants and other marginalized groups surged after Election Day in the United States, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate crimes and domestic extremist groups.'"}, "time": 1742564023.8647566}
