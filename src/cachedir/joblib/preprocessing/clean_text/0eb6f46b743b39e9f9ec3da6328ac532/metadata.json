However, the election proved that most Americans just don\u2019t care what celebrities have to say about politics. In a recent interview, comedian Bill Burr blasted arrogant celebrities, saying, \u201cYour ego is so f***ing big you think someone is going, \u2018well, I want to vote for Trump, but if he gets elected, we lose Cher!\u2019\u201d I could not agree more with what Burr said. These people are celebrities and have no knowledge of foreign relations, economics, or anything other than entertainment for that matter. The liberal celebrities feel their ability to read a script translates to the right to pontificate on the most important issues facing our country. Liberals have had Hollywood in their pocket for years. Other celebrities, such as Katy Perry, Robert De Niro, and Salma Hayek, all came out to support Hillary during the election. Why on earth do these people think anyone will change their vote just because an entertainer threatens to leave the country if his or her candidate doesn\u2019t win? Even if we did care, we all know they won\u2019t really move their entire lives to live in another country. Case in point: have any of these anti-Trump celebrities left yet? I didn\u2019t think so. But we should hold them to their vow! Every Hollywood liberal who threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected should start packing their bags. Send us a postcard when you are freezing your bums off in Canada! Celebrities only demonstrate one thing when they threaten to leave the US over election results: their disgusting arrogance. Do they honestly think they have a better idea about the economic conditions of the middle class than those actually living in the middle class? No. They just think they\u2019re entitled to the support of their fans. If they could come down to reality for two seconds and look at the election results, clearly regular Americans don\u2019t agree. To be frank, we care more about the future of our country than we do about any of these celebrities. Don\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019ll remember your hypocrisy and self-absorption when you threaten to leave if Trump is re-elected in 2020.
