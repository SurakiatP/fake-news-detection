I said this morning I\u2019d give begging a go, but the police in London are quite strict about that kind of thing and I was told to clear off\u201d. \\nThe grandson of four later added that he might try raising money as a street entertainer instead, and paint himself from head to toe in grey, cement like paint, stating he\u2019s very good at staying still. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve sent millions of emails to people around the world, asking them for a few bob, but you\u2019d swear I was asking for their first born or something,\u201d he added, \u201d Less than 1% of our readers give, but yet Wikipedia solves millions of drunken debates every minute; from who is your man starring in that film, to explaining the observational theory in quantum mechanics. Wiki saves time, and sometimes lives\u201d. \\nIf you wish to donate to Jimmy\u2019s cause, please click HERE'"}, "time": 1742628577.6509554}
