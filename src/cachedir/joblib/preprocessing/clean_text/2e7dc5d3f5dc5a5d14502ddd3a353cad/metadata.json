My thanks go out to all you manly men who\u2019ve resisted, defied, mocked, ignored or otherwise trashed the feminists\u2019 toxic agenda. Are you still opening doors for ladies, yielding your seats to them, or standing when they enter the room? Thank you. Are you teaching your sons to treat women with true respect rather than with the brutal \u201cequality\u201d that feminism dictates? Kudos to you. Do you refuse to deny the obvious differences in the sexes despite PC\u2019s orders to the contrary? Bravo! Do you revel in your God-given physical strength, your masculine orientation, your courage, honor, initiative and other male traits? Way to go! Do you love your wife as Christ does His Church, protecting her and your home and children as God designed you to do? May He richly bless you in this difficult task! \\nAmerica desperately needs many things: repentance and spiritual revival, love of liberty, rejection of all Marxism. But among our most devastating shortages are manly men who will vanquish the cultural and political nonsense enslaving us. \\nNow, gentlemen, go lift some weights and smoke a few cigars. 11:37 am on October 26, 2016'"}, "time": 1742562030.142199}
