[In an open letter, Rabbi Giuseppe Laras, the former chief rabbi of Milan, expressed his dismay that despite important advances in   relations, the Pope seems to repudiate them with his use of   rhetoric in his homilies.  \u201cWhat a shame,\u201d Rabbi Laras writes, that the official documents of the Catholic Church regarding the Jewish faith \u201cshould be contradicted on a daily basis by the homilies of the pontiff, who employs precisely the old, inveterate structure and its expressions, dissolving the contents of the aforementioned documents. \u201d As one example, the rabbi referenced the Pope\u2019s preaching on the law of \u201can eye for an eye,\u201d which, he said, the pontiff recently evoked \u201ccarelessly and mistakenly,\u201d leading to a misrepresentation of the meaning of the law for Judaism. Rabbi Laras is not the first Jewish leader to voice his displeasure over the pope\u2019s frequent references to the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the Jewish Pharisees and the \u201clegalism\u201d of the Jewish doctors of the law. Already in 2015, the chief rabbi of Rome, Riccardo di Segni, said that he had taken his complaints about the Pope\u2019s preaching directly to the pontiff himself, explaining exactly what he found offensive about his homilies. In his letter, Rabbi Laras associates the Pope\u2019s treatment of Judaism to what he sees as a broader problem with contemporary Catholic discourse involving the Jewish faith. Laras wrote that he was not alone in this impression, identifying a number of \u201cdisquieting facts,\u201d which \u201cmany of us have felt in the air for quite some time. \u201d These \u201cdisquieting facts\u201d include \u201ca substantial distrust of the Bible and a subsequent minimization of the Jewish biblical roots of Christianity,\u201d which, he said, seemed to indicate a new form of the ancient Christian heresy of Marcionism, which held that the God of the Old Testament was fundamentally different from the God worshiped by Christians. The biblical dichotomy between Old and New Testaments, Laras argues, signals \u201cthe resumption of the old polarization between the morality and theology of the Hebrew Bible and of Pharisaism, and Jesus of Nazareth and the Gospels. \u201d The rabbi also underscored the Church\u2019s \u201cembracing of Islam, which is all the stronger as the Christian side is more critical toward Judaism, now including even the Bible and biblical theology. \u201d He also identified an undercurrent \u201cof resentment, intolerance, and annoyance on the Christian side toward Judaism. \u201d These and other troubling signs were made very apparent by a recently published event guide for the upcoming fall conference of the Italian Biblical Association (ABI) Rabbi Laras contended. \u201cI observe with the highest displeasure and concern that this ABI program is substantially a defeat for the presuppositions and contents of   dialogue,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhich for some time now has been reduced, sadly, to fluff and hot air. \u201d \u201cI am, and this is a euphemism, very indignant and embittered!\u201d he said. Some Vatican observers have suggested that the Pope\u2019s remarks that have angered the Jewish community stem not so much from any   on the Pope\u2019s part as from his \u201ccarelessness in speech\u201d allied to his dislike of doctrinal precision. \u201cHe is possessed of so negative an attitude toward theology that he fails to frame his comments with the requisite precision,\u201d wrote Father Peter Stravinskas, author of The Catholic Church and the Bible, in a recent essay. At the core of the issues that have so distressed Rabbi Laras, he contends, is the Pope\u2019s deep dislike of doctrine, theology and Canon Law. \u201cFrancis consistently pits \u2018the Law\u2019 against \u2018the Gospel,\u2019\u201d Stravinskas writes, and his \u201callergic reactions to law make him see stark differences where complementarity is more in order. \u201d \u201cFrancis rails against law because of his predisposition against canon law and canon lawyers  \u2014   as well as moral theologians who represent the consistent trajectory of Catholic morality,\u201d he wrote. As a result, the Pope\u2019s \u201cuninformed and tendentious statements risk setting   relations back decades, if not centuries,\u201d Stravinskas claimed. Follow Thomas D.
