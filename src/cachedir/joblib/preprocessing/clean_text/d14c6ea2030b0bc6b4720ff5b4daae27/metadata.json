(4 hours ago) \\nWhen people asked Veronica Aguilar where her son was, she told them he had been placed in an institution in Mexico, according to court records. Only her three other children \u2014 two of whom slept on a bed just outside the closet door \u2014 knew the truth, and they said they were forbidden by their mother from saying anything, authorities say. \\nYonatan Daniel Aguilar\u2019s tortured life came to an end in August. Police later found the 11-year-old\u2019s battered, malnourished 34-pound body in the bedroom closet of the family\u2019s tiny Echo Park home. \\nThe grim details are laid out in records The Times obtained from Los Angeles County Juvenile Court this week. The records help explain how the people charged with his well-being \u2014 school officials, police, social workers and therapists \u2014 lost track of him despite earlier allegations of abuse. But they also raise new questions about whether more could have been done to save the boy who, court records suggest, might have been autistic and thus was treated differently. \\nLos Angeles police detectives investigating the case believed Aguilar\u2019s efforts to hide the boy were so effective that even the boy\u2019s stepfather, Jose Pinzon, didn\u2019t know Yonatan lived with them all along. \\nThe day of Yonatan\u2019s death, Moses Castillo, the supervising LAPD detective on the case, placed Pinzon and Yonatan\u2019s siblings together in a room \u201cto see the reaction,\u201d Department of Children and Family Services records state. As detectives and a county social worker stood by, Pinzon \u201cimmediately confronts the children that he had no idea that minor [Yonatan] was living in the house the whole time they were there,\u201d records state.

There was foam in his nose and medicinal cups of pink and red liquid near his body. He was going bald. \\n\u201cI took care of the problem by ruining my life,\u201d Aguilar told Pinzon, according to the court records.

(4 hours ago) \\nThe Times petitioned the court to release DCFS case records, as well as police and coroner\u2019s reports regarding Yonatan. Michael Levanas, the presiding judge of L.A. County\u2019s Juvenile Court, ordered the release of more than 160 pages of partially redacted records, saying they \u201cshed light on what was going on in the family\u2019s home\u201d and why the boy was left in his mother\u2019s care. \\nYonatan\u2019s family had been the subject of six reports to DCFS alleging possible abuse or neglect, records show. Yonatan\u2019s risk of abuse at home had been marked as \u201chigh\u201d four times from 2009 to 2012 by a computerized program intended to gauge social workers\u2019 level of intervention. Social workers, records show, declined to open a case, saying the allegations of physical abuse were inconclusive or unfounded. \\nDCFS Director Philip Browning said that the department had investigated several reports of abuse and neglect and that everyone interacting with the child and his family, including medical workers, teachers and police, thought \u201cthe child was in a safe environment.\u201d \\n\u201cWe talked to the school nurse, the school doctors, school counselors, the teachers, everyone, including the LAPD investigators, who all said everything was OK,\u201d Browning said, \u201cWe were very surprised what occurred here.

He was pulled out of school and kept hidden as the family moved from home to home, documents show. DCFS officials said they received no further reports about the boy and had no legal right to inquire about him without a report. \\nThe department\u2019s contact with the family began in 2002, before Yonatan\u2019s birth.
