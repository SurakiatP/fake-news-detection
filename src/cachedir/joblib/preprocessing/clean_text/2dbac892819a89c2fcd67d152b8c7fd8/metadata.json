In true Hollywood fashion, Ms.   returned to her hometown, Los Angeles, and from her brief visit spun Stars Hollow  \u2014   a charming New England small town with its own resident troubadour. Stars Hollow would become the setting for \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d her cultishly popular   dramedy that ran for seven seasons on the WB (and later the CW). Last weekend, more than 1, 300 fans, most of them women, many of them mothers and daughters, descended on this rural town in western Connecticut (population: 3, 500) for the first Gilmore Girls Fan Fest. They had come from Oklahoma and Minnesota and as far away as Brazil  \u2014   and paid as much as $250 per ticket  \u2014   to see the \u201creal\u201d Stars Hollow and meet some of the actors who play its residents. In a way, they wanted to do the impossible: to experience in waking life a dream town built on a studio backlot. In Stars Hollow, for instance, it would not have been chilly and pouring rain, and the community green would not have become a mud field. There would have been a gazebo in the center of town, something Washington Depot, one of the villages within the town, conspicuously lacks. But faced with these and other realities, the attendees cheerily persevered. They stood holding umbrellas in a line that stretched clear out the door of the Hickory Stick Bookshop to get signed copies of the cookbook \u201cEat Like a Gilmore\u201d by Kristi Carlson. They queued up in droves on the plaza to get a selfie with the   character Jackson (Jackson Douglas). They gathered in front of the stately town hall building, where three Gilmore cast members made an impromptu appearance on the steps to sing an acoustic rendition of \u201cWhere You Lead,\u201d the show\u2019s theme song. Brittany White, 31, a schoolteacher, drove two hours from Rhode Island with her mother, Nancy. She was carrying a coffee mug she made that read \u201cLuke\u2019s,\u201d a reference to the greasy spoon diner run by the show\u2019s resident heartthrob, Luke Danes. Both women were on a high from having just met Kirk, another Stars Hollow resident. \u201cThis is Stars Hollow for us,\u201d Brittany White said. \u201cI keep saying that little food market is like Doose\u2019s Market. Even the hardware store\u201d  \u2014   the Washington Supply Company  \u2014   \u201cis amazing. \u201d Sean Gunn, who played Kirk, was one of 20 or so actors and crew members to fly in for the fan fest (he hosted a cat adoption at 9 a. m. on Saturday). He believes the lasting popularity of \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d which went off the air nine years ago but will return next month with new episodes on Netflix, is due in part to the community togetherness it presents. Stars Hollow, Mr. Gunn said, is \u201can idealized version of the way a small town could function. \u201d The town of Lorelai Gilmore, a single mom, and her daughter, Rory, has a walkable main street lined with   businesses, a manicured village square, an   soda shop, a cozy inn, a decent public high school, a \u201cChurchogogue\u201d for both Christian and Jewish worshipers, and a citizenry of quirky, literate, engaged residents who participate in local government. It is a civic formula that has proved elusive for fans who have sought a   version to move to. Amy Do, a videographer and graphic designer who lives in the Bay Area, spent a week two years ago   around Connecticut, including in Washington Depot, a quest she chronicled on her blog, Finding Stars Hollow. \u201cI went during Christmastime because I thought it would give me a good magical feel with the towns blanketed in snow,\u201d Ms. Do said, adding that each place she visited lacked some crucial element. \u201cI noticed these main streets had a couple of boutiques here and there, but there wasn\u2019t a diner where you could get a burger,\u201d she said. \u201cOr there weren\u2019t people walking around. In Stars Hollow, you always see people walking around. \u201d (Indeed, they\u2019re called extras.) Vanessa Marano, another former cast member who was at the fan fest, is aware of the illusory quality of Stars Hollow whenever she auditions on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, Calif. where the set remains more or less intact. \u201cIt does look like a small town,\u201d Ms. Marano said, \u201cbut you know you\u2019re on a set because there\u2019s equipment everywhere. \u201d Washington Depot does not have a strollable main street or a diner either, but since it is where Ms.   stayed, it was the natural setting for a gathering of the Gilmores. The festival was dreamed up by Jennie Whitaker and her husband, Marcus, fans of the series who run a public relations firm based in Austin, Tex. As frequently happens in Connecticut, they were stuck in traffic near Hartford during a road trip this past summer and got to wondering about Washington Depot and why it had never honored its claim to   fame. Back home, Ms. Whitaker contacted the town\u2019s board of selectmen and soon found herself sitting in Washington Depot\u2019s town hall and meeting with its community leaders, many of whom were men over 65 who had never watched the show. \u201cThere are many cults to which I have been drawn, but this was not one,\u201d said Dan Sherr, 75, a resident who met with the Whitakers and supported their idea. While the head selectman, Mark Lyon, eventually gave the Whitakers approval for the festival, he and the others were doubtful that anyone would show up. There were also some residents opposed to the festival altogether. But \u201cwe sold out the event in 10\u00bd hours,\u201d Ms. Whitaker said. \u201cPeople have wanted something like this for so long. \u201d As if aware they were suddenly extras in a large production, many of the town\u2019s residents, particularly its savvier business owners, threw themselves into the festival. Jim Kelly turned over his law firm office to serve as a media hub and cast green room, while Liz Page offered free homemade chili and cornbread outside her gift shop, Newbury Place. Thanks to his       resemblance to Luke, Ms. Page\u2019s brawny husband, Alan, found himself wildly popular as he manned the slow cooker. Jay Combs, an owner of the Washington Supply Company, set up a Formica table with place settings and transformed a corner of the hardware store into Luke\u2019s Diner. All day, the   shop owner greeted   Lorelais and Rorys, borrowing their smartphones and trudging outside in the rain to snap souvenir pictures of them through the   window. \u201cThe fans are nuts, but not in a crazy way,\u201d Mr. Combs said. He added that \u201cbecause I\u2019m under siege, so to speak,\u201d he and his wife, like many town residents, have been watching \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and are on Season 3 (the year Rory graduates from high school). Throughout the day, Mr. Combs did hear rumblings from some fans who were disappointed that Washington Depot did not look more like Stars Hollow. A theory circulated that Ms.   had taken aspects of several nearby towns (the gazebo in New Milford, the main street of Kent) and Frankensteined the mythic community. It\u2019s a likely truth that Ms. Do, who did not attend the festival, had already discovered during her road trip. As in a wholesome TV show, though, in the end she learned a lesson. \u201cIt told me the only way to visit Stars Hollow,\u201d Ms. Do said, \u201cis to play an episode of \u2018Gilmore Girls. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563900.506006}
