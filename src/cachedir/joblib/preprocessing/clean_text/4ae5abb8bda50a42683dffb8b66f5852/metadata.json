He said the Supreme Court should not be in conflict with other branches of government \u201cbecause it is only an arbiter. \u201d The state television network VTV on Saturday published summaries of the court\u2019s most recent rulings in which the judges said they had \u201csuppressed\u201d parts of an earlier decision to nullify the legislature and allow the court to write laws itself. Judge Moreno said the court had also reversed a decision to strip lawmakers of their immunity from prosecution. The court\u2019s initial ruling, published on Wednesday night, prompted widespread outrage because it removed what most consider to be the last remaining check to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s growing power, the   legislature. The court, packed with judges loyal to Mr. Maduro, is considered to be controlled by the president. Saturday\u2019s decision appeared to have support among top officials in Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. Ernesto Villegas, the information minister, characterized the previous rulings as a mistake when he took to Twitter on Saturday to say that the court was \u201ccorrecting the rulings. \u201d But as of late Saturday, the court itself had not published its rulings on its website, leaving it unclear how far the court planned to go in restoring the legislature\u2019s powers, which it has been chipping away at for more than a year. Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, a Venezuelan political scientist, said the court appeared to consider the legislature to be in contempt, meaning that it might not be able to pass laws, even if the court agreed not to take over its legislative powers. The court has also spent the past year overturning major decisions made by the chamber, Ms. L\u00f3pez said, including a law granting amnesty to political prisoners and moves to block the president from expanding his power over the economy. That stalemate, she added, seemed unlikely to change. \u201cIt\u2019s like a chess game where you just moved one pawn,\u201d she said. Enrique S\u00e1nchez Falc\u00f3n, a Venezuelan constitutional expert, said he also believed that the court would continue to consider the legislature to be in contempt of the law and questioned whether it was even legal for its earlier decision to be revised. But the series of events had done damage to the rule of law in Venezuela, he said. \u201cThe constitutional order of Venezuela has been completely fractured,\u201d he said. On Saturday, the Venezuelan opposition showed no signs that it would accept the court\u2019s reversal as evidence that a respect for democratic principles had been restored. Several thousand protesters gathered in the streets in a show of support for the National Assembly. Witnesses said that security forces dispersed by firing tear gas canisters, which injured at least two lawmakers who had joined the protest. The court\u2019s initial decision also revealed dissent within Mr. Maduro\u2019s movement that could reflect limits on his march toward   rule. Chief among them was Luisa Ortega, the attorney general, who on Friday issued a dramatic rebuke to the president, holding a news conference in which she said that the rulings violated the inclusive spirit of Venezuela\u2019s laws. The decision by the court represented \u201ca rupture in the constitutional order,\u201d Ms. Ortega said. Ms. Ortega, a longtime follower of Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has remained loyal to Mr. Maduro. But she emerged as a leading critic when she spoke out against a massacre of civilians by the military in the Barlovento region, outside Caracas, in October. Am\u00e9rico Mart\u00ed, a Venezuelan lawyer and leftist leader, said that Ms. Ortega\u2019s dissent represented a \u201ckind of democratic reaction within Chavismo and a reflection of the international and national pressure\u201d the movement was facing. The court\u2019s decision generated condemnation outside Venezuela as well, with critics saying that the country had become a dictatorship in all but name. Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, a regional body that aims to promote democracy, trade, and economic and social development, called the move a \u201c  coup,\u201d while the United States and other countries condemned the decision as eroding the country\u2019s democracy. \u201cWhat we have warned of has finally come to pass,\u201d said Mr. Almagro, who has spent much of the past year chastising the government, even accusing Mr. Maduro of aiming to become a \u201cpetty dictator. \u201d Critics say the court\u2019s assault on the legislature is part of a longer slide away from democracy that has come as the government\u2019s popularity has declined amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory. Falling oil prices and years of economic mismanagement have left many Venezuelans facing shortages of food and basic medicines, setting off widespread protests. The government is holding at least 114 political prisoners, according to Penal Forum, a human rights group. Local elections that were to have been held last year have been postponed.'"}, "time": 1742562312.6137075}
