A.G\u2019s party from Ballotpedia . \\n* Previous week\u2019s margin in parenthesis (thus). Flipped states ( thus ). \\nStill very much a horse-race; Clinton flipped Florida (though by a tiny amount); but Trump flipped Nevada and North Carolina. (All this data is averaged over the 10/26 \u2013 11/6 time frame, and I can\u2019t imagine they capture late shifts in any direction.) To the Times interactive once again : \\nRemember the interactive focuses on swing states, listed in the table above. We give Trump every state where he is ahead: Ohio, North Carolina, Nevada (!), Iowa. Trump has 44 paths to victory; Clinton, 19. We reserve Florida and New Hampshire, because Clinton\u2019s margin in both states is razor thin, and give her Virgina, Pennsylvania, Wisconson, and Colorado: \\nSo even if Trump wins Florida, he has to win New Hampshire, too. Hoo boy. And to think all this campaign had to do was gag him and take away the Android phone he was tweeting from. The slightest bit of self-discipline on Trump\u2019s part, and Clinton is suddenly in the race of her life. Shows her extreme weakness as a candidate, and the decadence of the Democrat nomenklatura that forced her nomination through, not to mention the decadence of the political class, which can\u2019t seem to get approximately half the electorat to accept their view that Trump is history\u2019s worst monster, despite extraordinary unity of purpose and a deluge of propaganda. Prediction: This election will resolve nothing, and volatility will increase. \\nNow let\u2019s look at the House and Senate: \\nThis week, the House: \\nLooking good for our friend, gridlock. \\nThis week, the Senate: \\nLast week: \\nIt\u2019s a tossup (though you\u2019ve gotta note 7 of the 8 toss-ups are Republicans.

Three-quarters of the country will vote on a paper ballot this fall, says Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, a group that promotes best practices at the polls. Only five states\u2014Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, and New Jersey\u2014use \u201cdirect recording electronic\u201d (DRE) machines exclusively. But lots of other states use electronic machines in some capacity\u201d [ Wired ]. \\n\u201cLack of poll workers and low numbers of voting machines are key contributors to long voting lines, and precincts with more minorities experienced longer waits\u201d [ Brennan Center ].

That would be a letdown from their earlier hopes of a 54- or 55-seat advantage and put Republicans in the pole position to win back the chamber in 2018.\u201d \\nThe Trail \\nBest pro-Trump piece I\u2019ve seen: \u201cThe GOP\u2019s \u2018Ungrateful Bastard\u2019 Caucus\u201d [ American Greatness ]. \\nBest pro-Clinton piece remains: \u201cVote for the Lying Neoliberal Warmonger: It\u2019s Important\u201d [ Common Dreams ]. \\nThe best reasons I can think of to vote for each candidate (as opposed to against the other candidates). In no particular order: Trump: A realist foreign policy Clinton: More of the same Stein: Break the two-party duopoloy Johnson: Sanity on marijuna legalization \\nThese reasons are, of course, entirely incommensurate. \\n\u201cThe American Conservative Presidential Symposium\u201d [ The American Conservative ]. Michael Tracey: \u201cTrump might be better than Hillary on foreign policy (my top issue), but he\u2019s far too volatile to conclude that with any certainty, and he may well end up being catastrophically worse. The Clintons\u2019 outrageous stoking of a war fervor over Russia is quite simply depraved and should disqualify them from reentering the White House\u2026. Democrats deserve punishment for nominating a candidate with such severe legal problems, stifling a genuine populist insurgent in the most craven possible fashion (I supported Bernie Sanders but find his recent hectoring pro-Clinton conduct highly off-putting). Their shambolic, \u2018rigged\u2019 primary process can\u2019t be countenanced, nor can the 2016 electoral debacle as a whole, so I\u2019ll do my small part in rejecting this horror show by declining to vote.\u201d \\nRealignment \\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Ruling Elite Has Failed and Deserves to Be Fired\u201d [ Of Two Minds ]. \u201d The last failed remnants of the state-cartel hierarchies left over from World War II must implode before we can move forward. Healthcare, defense, pharmaceuticals, higher education, the mainstream media and the systems of governance must all decay to the point that no one can be protected from the destructive consequences of their failure, and no paychecks can be issued by these failed systems.\u201d Tellingly, the author omits the FIRE sector. So I would say their definition of elite is odd. \\n\u201c[E]ducation levels are a more significant factor this year. Obama won a majority of those with a high school diploma (or less) in 2012, while Romney won college-educated voters. This year the numbers are reversed. Among white voters with only a high school education, Trump leads by over 25 points. Among whites with a college degree, Clinton leads by about 10 percent. This is the first time since serious polling began in 1952 that this has happened [ RealClearPoltiics ]. And when I ask myself who sent the United States heading toward Third World status, it\u2019s not those without college degrees. In fact, it\u2019s Clinton\u2019s base. \\n\u201cThe Last Gasp of the American Dream\u201d [ The Archdruid Report ]. \\n[M]illions of Americans trudge through a bleak round of layoffs, wage cuts, part-time jobs at minimal pay, and system-wide dysfunction. The crisis hasn\u2019t hit yet, but those members of the political class who think that the people who used to be rock-solid American patriots will turn out en masse to keep today\u2019s apparatchiks secure in their comfortable lifestyles have, as the saying goes, another think coming. Nor is it irrelevant that most of the enlisted personnel in the armed forces, who are the US government\u2019s ultimate bulwark against popular unrest, come from the very classes that have lost faith most drastically in the American system. The one significant difference between the Soviet case and the American one at this stage of the game is that Soviet citizens had no choice but to accept the leaders the Communist Party of the USSR foisted off on them, from Brezhnev to Andropov to Chernenko to Gorbachev, until the system collapsed of its own weight\u2026 \\nIf George W. Bush was our Leonid Brezhnev, as I\u2019d suggest, and Barack Obama is our Yuri Andropov, Hillary Clinton is running for the position of Konstantin Chernenko; her running mate Tim Kaine, in turn, is waiting in the wings as a suitably idealistic and clueless Mikhail Gorbachev, under whom the whole shebang can promptly go to bits. While I don\u2019t seriously expect the trajectory of the United States to parallel that of the Soviet Union anything like as precisely as this satiric metaphor would suggest, the basic pattern of cascading dysfunction ending in political collapse is quite a common thing in history, and a galaxy of parallels suggests that the same thing could very easily happen here within the next decade or so. The serene conviction among the political class and their affluent hangers-on that nothing of the sort could possibly take place is just another factor making it more likely. \\n\u201cWhy Trump Is Different\u2014and Must Be Repelled\u201d [Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker ]. \\nFor the past months, and into this final week, as for much of the past year, many New Yorkers have been in a position that recalls parents with a colicky baby: you put the baby down at last, it seems safely asleep, grateful and unbelievably exhausted you return to bed\u2014only to hear the small tell-tale cough or sob that guarantees another crying jag is on the way. The parents in this case, to fill in the metaphorical blanks, are liberal-minded folk; the baby\u2019s cries are any indicators that Donald Trump may not be out of the race for President\u2014as he seemed to be even as recently as last week\u2014and may actually have a real chance at being elected. Disbelief crowds exhaustion: this can\u2019t be happening. If the colicky baby is a metaphor too sweet for so infantile a figure as the orange menace, then let us think instead, perhaps, of the killer in a teen horror movie of the vintage kind: every time Freddy seemed dispatched and buried, there he was leaping up again, as the teens caught their breath and returned, too soon, to their teendom. \\nOf course, Gopnik \u2014 a bad-faith liberal who should really stick to writing gauzy atmospheric pieces about Paris \u2014 is both passive-aggressive and infuriatingly smug. To \u201cfill in the metaphorical blanks,\u201d both the \u201ccolicky baby\u201d and the teen horror movie villain are infantilized and displaced versions of The Other: The Trump voter that Eurostar-rider Gopnik hates and fears, because he\u2019s afraid their going to kill him and take his stuff. \\nDemocrat Email Hairball \\n\u201cDow surges 300 points as FBI clears Clinton on eve of election\u201d [ USA Today ]. Hmm.

However, it is among the highest for the month of October in the survey\u2019s nine-year trend\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cThe latest spending average is similar to the $91 recorded in October 2008, a measure taken at the beginning of a steep slide in Americans\u2019 spending amid the financial crisis of 2008.\u201d Eight years of crap and back to square one, except for the lost wealth, of course. Best economy ever! \\nLabor Market Conditions Index, October 2016: \u201cAverage hourly earnings are one of 19 indicators tracked in the labor market conditions index but the component no doubt made an outsized contribution to the October composite which rose\u201d [ Econoday ]. (This is the Fed\u2019s experimental index.) \u201cElements of last week\u2019s employment report, especially wages, are consistent with a pivot higher for the labor market and today\u2019s gain in this index could be offering its own signpost.\u201d Dear Lord, a \u201cpivot. I thought \u201cpivot\u201d was a Beltway word, but it seems to have migrated. Ugh. \\nEmployment Situation (11/4): \u201c[T]he deceleration of employment growth continues in what\u2019s now been a very steady decline going on 2 years. And with employment growth decelerating at this rate it\u2019s likely the unemployment rate will remain elevated indefinitely\u201d [ Mosler Economics ]. \\nReal Estate: \u201cWhen it comes to the state of the industrial real estate market, landlords continue to have the upper hand over tenants, due to ongoing market factors, according to the Third Quarter Industrial Outlook report recently issued by commercial real estate firm JLL\u201d [ Logistics Management ]. \u201cLooking at total U.S. absorption, JLL observed that more than one-third is derived from four key markets that indicate a bulk of the activity still remains in primary industrial cities. These markets include: Chicago at 6.4 percent; Houston at 8.5 percent; Dallas/Fort Worth at 8.6 percent; and Philadelphia/Harrisburg at 10.5 percent\u2026. When asked to rank the top three types of occupiers for industrial estate property at the moment, [Aaron Ahlburn, director of industrial research for JLL] cited e-commerce, traditional retail, and 3PL [third-party logistics] and logistics/parcel delivery players.\u201d So, a bet on continued globalization? \\nShipping: \u201cTruck, rail pricing power may shift in early 2017\u201d [ Journal of Commerce ]. \u201cShippers moving freight throughout the US are enjoying the kind of pricing power they usually only hold during recessions, thanks to a thick layer of excess truck capacity and overstocked inventories, combined with lower fuel costs and fuel surcharges. The strong dollar and skittish consumer demand, at least for items bigger than packages, also play a role.\u201d Weirdly, the happy talk headline isn\u2019t supported by any data in the article. \\nShipping: \u201cCalls grow for Pakistan to adopt shipbreaking code in wake of last week\u2019s deadly inferno\u201d [ Splash247 ]. \u201cThe speakers at the [National Trade Union Federation] protest called for a shipbreaking code to be instituted in Pakistan, noting how workplace accidents at Indian breaking yards had dropped since New Delhi put in its own ship recycling regulations.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cThe world\u2019s seas were a safer place for those navigating them from June to September 2016, maritime security intelligence firm Dryad Maritime reported.Security incidents, including piracy, boardings and robberies, fell compared with the first half of 2016\u201d [ Lloyd\u2019s List ]. \\nShipping: \u201cCargo thieves have traditionally targeted compact high-value items such as cash and electronics, but lately, improved warehouse security has pushed the crooks to diversify their portfolios and start stealing a range of items, including food, alcohol, and clothing\u201d [ DC Velocity ]. \u201cRather than lurking around DCs [distribution centers], cargo thieves are increasingly focused on mobile targets like trucks and trailers. Examples of recent thefts include hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of salmon in Norway, cases of whiskey in London, and truckloads of nuts around the globe\u2026. In another escapade, thieves snatched six pallets of maple syrup destined for Japan from a Montreal company\u2019s truck yard, making off with $150,000 in sweet merchandise\u2026. In past years, these items might have been difficult to resell, but the Internet makes it easy to locate a buyer for almost anything.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201d transportation hiring suggests companies increasingly are putting workers in place to meet another big seasonal push toward web-based sales. They\u2019ll need sales demand to show up since hiring in the retail and manufacturing sectors both slipped back last month. Jobs at goods-producing companies overall were flat in October, a sign that any expansion in demand in the next couple of months will have to come from shipments heading to consumers\u201d [ Wall Street Journal ]. \\nHoney for the Bears: \u201cNew registrations of commercial vehicles in gross vehicle weight (GVW) classes 4 to 8 are down 4.2 percent through August of this year, according to the Englewood, Colo., consulting firm IHS Markit\u201d [ DC Velocity ]. \u201cThe statistics could foreshadow rough results for corporate earnings, since large trucks are almost exclusively used for business purposes\u2026 [Then again] part of the explanation for these statistics may be that owners are holding on to their vehicles longer.\u201d \\nThe Bezzle: \u201d DOJ, SEC now investigating Wells Fargo sales practices\u201d [ FCPA Blog ]. \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cAirbnb tide appears to be on the ebb\u201d [ Hotel News Notes ].

This is based on the Labor Market Conditions Index. \\nPolitical Risk: \u201cThis will be a light week for economic data\u201d [ Calculated Risk ]. \u201cThe key event will be the US election on Tuesday.\u201d That\u2019s so understated you\u2019d think McBride was a Brit! \\nPolitical Risk: \u201cWith the U.S. election just one day away, Bloomberg compiled a cross-asset guide to how Wall Street strategists predict the markets will react in the event that Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton wins the presidency. We\u2019ve also included a separate scenario on how they might move if the Democrats recaptured the Senate and the House of Representatives along with the presidency; a Trump victory likely entails that Republicans would keep control of both houses of Congress\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. \\nRapture Index: Closes down 1 on drug abuse [ Rapture Index ].

Michele Yezzo] longtime forensic scientist at the state crime lab now stands accused of slanting evidence to help cops and prosecutors build their cases\u201d [ Columbus Dispatch ]. \u201cIn the records, colleagues and supervisors described these concerns about Yezzo: She threatened to use a gun to shoot her co-workers and herself. She threw a 6-inch metal plate at one co-worker. She exposed her breasts to BCI agents at a bar, flipped off her boss and acted in a hostile manner to almost every lab employee, according to records. She was accused of calling an African-American scientist a racial slur, something Yezzo denies. She frequently broke into crying spells for no apparent reason Forensic scientists quit because of her erratic behavior. At one point her union, the Fraternal Order of Police, refused to back her.\u201d Wowsers.

The authorities have rightly adjusted to this reality by increasingly prosecuting companies rather than going after individual miscreants.\u201d \\nYikes! This extraordinary argument is cousin to the Lieutenant Calley defense , i.e., that soldiers bear no responsibility for crimes they were ordered to execute. The Economist here would have you believe that there\u2019s no such thing as an individual crime in a corporate context. \\nClass Warfare \\nOn neoliberalism [Matt Stoller, Facebook , via Atrios ]. \\nNeoliberalism is a kind of statecraft. It means organizing state policies by making them appear as if they are the consequences of depoliticized financial markets. It involves moving power from public institutions to private institutions, and allowing governance to happen through concentrated financial power. Actual open markets for goods and services tend to disappear in neoliberal societies. Financial markets flourish, real markets morph into mass distribution middlemen like Walmart or Amazon. \\nNeoliberalism is not faith in free markets. Neoliberalism is not free market capitalism. Neoliberalism is a specific form of statecraft that uses financial markets as a veil to disguise governing policies. \\nWhat oft was thought but ne\u2019er so well expressed \\nStoller is paraphrasing his review of Greta Krippner\u2019s Capitalizing on Crisis , which sounds well worth a read. \\n\u201cUncovering Credit Disparities among Low- and Moderate-Income Areas\u201d [ Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis ]. \u201cEggleston found that LMI [lower abd middle-income] neighborhoods with relatively better credit tend to be in metros with a larger percentage of white residents, and they are typically found in the East, West and parts of the upper Midwest.
