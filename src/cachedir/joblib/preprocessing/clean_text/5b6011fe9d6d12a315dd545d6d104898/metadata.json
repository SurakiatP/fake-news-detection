But there has been little organized resistance to her choosing hawkish foreign policy advisers. Indeed, Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment has purged almost anyone who isn\u2019t part of the neoconservative/liberal-interventionist \u201cgroup think.\u201d That\u2019s why pretty much everyone who \u201cmatters\u201d agrees about the need to push around Russia, China, Syria, Iran, etc. Reflecting that attitude, Sunday\u2019s lead editorial in the neocon Washington Post hailed the broad consensus within the Establishment for more warlike actions once President Obama is gone, taking with him what the Post calls Obama\u2019s \u201cself-defeating passivity.\u201d The Post praised a new report from the liberal Center for American Progress which calls for bombing the Syrian military and getting tough to \u201ccounter Iran\u2019s negative influence\u201d in line with what all the neocons \u2014 as well as Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 want the next President to do. The absence of any significant counter to this neocon/liberal-hawk \u201cgroup think\u201d represents one of the greatest dangers to the future of the human species, since this new hubris comes with a cavalier assumption that nuclear-armed Russia and China will simply accept humiliation dished out by the \u201cindispensable nation.\u201d If they don\u2019t, we can expect Official Washington to ratchet up tensions in a game of nuclear chicken with the expectation that the leaders in Moscow and Beijing will bow down to US \u201cexceptionalism\u2019 and slink away with their tails between their legs. Surely, that is what the armchair warriors at The Washington Post will demand and they have, of course, a spotless record of infallibility, such as their certainty that Iraq was hiding stockpiles of WMD in 2003. Editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt was so sure of that he wrote it as flat fact . Given the Iraq War catastrophe and the failure to find the WMD, you might have assumed that Hiatt was summarily fired and has never worked in journalism again. But, of course, you\u2019d be wrong. He is still the editorial-page editor of The Washington Post continuing to ladle out his extraordinary wisdom and brilliant insights. The New McCarthyism And, if you dare question those new certainties or note the risks of stumbling into a nuclear conflagration, the Post\u2019s editorial pages label you a Moscow stooge repeating Russian propaganda. That is what Post columnist Anne Applebaum wrote about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump when he warned about the risks of World War III if a President Hillary Clinton starts shooting down Russian planes over Syria. Rather than acknowledge the genuine risk of getting into a shooting war with Russia, neocon Applebaum declares such concerns unacceptable and offers a whiff of McCarthyism toward anyone who thinks such a thing. \u201cWhy is Russian state media using such extreme language?\u201d she asks darkly. \u201cAnd why is Trump repeating it?\u201d Then, with the typical perceptiveness of a neocon ideologue, Applebaum determines that the Kremlin is warning its citizens about the growing risks of nuclear war to scare them into line amid a recession that the US helped create as part of its \u201cregime change\u201d strategy to destabilize Russia by making its economy scream. A thoughtful person might stop here and wonder if the use of economic sanctions and other means to destabilize nuclear-armed Russia is such a good idea, but no mainstream person is allowed to raise such questions inside Official Washington. That would just make you a Russian puppet, in Applebaum\u2019s view. Applebaum then rants on with some wild conspiracy theories about Russian plans to exploit the US presidential transition: \u201cWhatever the outcome on Nov. 8, political uncertainty will follow: the months of transition, a change of White House staff, perhaps even the violent backlash that Trump may incite. This could be an excellent moment for a major Russian offensive: a land grab in Ukraine, a foray into the Baltic states, a much bigger intervention in the Middle East \u2014 anything to \u2018test\u2019 the new president. \u201cIf that\u2019s coming, Putin needs to prepare his public to fight much bigger wars and to persuade the rest of the world not to stop him. He needs to get his generals into the right mind-set, and his soldiers ready to go. A little nuclear war rhetoric never fails to focus attention, and I\u2019m sure it has.\u201d Reckless Drivel Perhaps the more immediate question here is why a major American newspaper runs such crazy and reckless drivel from one of its regular columnists. But the fact that the Post does so indicates how dangerous the moment is for humanity. For those of us who read the Post regularly, such insane rhetoric barely registers since we see similar nuttiness on a daily basis. But the \u201cgroup think\u201d that the Post and other mainstream publications create and then enforce explains why there is such unity among the Establishment as it presses ahead with these dangerous policies in much the same manner that almost the same cast of insiders \u201cgroup thought\u201d their way into the disastrous Iraq War. So, the wannabe insiders at the Center for American Progress and the more established pooh-bahs at the Brookings Institution and other preeminent think tanks know they have to promote \u201cregime change\u201d strategies and other forms of warmongering to appease Hiatt and his fellow neocon editorialists and columnists. In Washington, this \u201cgroup think\u201d has moved beyond the usual careerist and conformist \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d into something more akin to totalitarianism, at least on foreign policy issues. That is why it is hard to even come up with a list of sensible people who could survive the onslaught of character assassinations if they were to be proposed as senior advisers to a President Hillary Clinton. That is also why the attention of progressives, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, only on vetting domestic officials in a prospective Hillary Clinton administration is so insufficient. If a hawkish President Clinton surrounds herself with like-minded neocons and liberal hawks, the costs of their warmongering would surely swallow up the tax dollars necessary for domestic priorities \u2013 on infrastructure, education, health care, the environment and other pressing concerns. And, if the McCarthyistic intolerance of The Washington Post influences or infects her administration, the genuine risks of World War III will dwarf any other worries.
