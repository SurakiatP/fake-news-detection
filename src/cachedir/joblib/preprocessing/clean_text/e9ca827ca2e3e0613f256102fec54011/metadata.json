Wesley Morris, critic at large for The New York Times, joins its chief film critics Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott to survey the state of the debate now that people have actually seen the movie. The discussion may include spoilers. A. O. SCOTT The   backlash was another of those reactionary     that have become a fixture of our culture and our politics lately. The wounded   will keep on whining about their ruined childhoods, but meanwhile the debate has moved in other directions. The movie\u2019s feminist bona fides have been questioned, notably by Alyssa Rosenberg in The Washington Post, who wrote that she was \u201cmore dismayed by the idea that the uproar around \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 has pushed feminists into championing Paul Feig\u2019s remake\u201d than by the misogynist outrage over the   cast. And why is Leslie Jones\u2019s character, the only nonwhite Ghostbuster, also the only nonscientist? I have to say it makes me very happy when big commercial movies provoke serious political arguments, but before we dive into that particular fray I want to make a few statements I trust will not be terribly controversial. 1) Kate McKinnon should be in every movie from now on. 2) The new \u201cGhostbusters\u201d is like the old \u201cGhostbusters\u201d in that it gives comic performers who gained popularity on television and in more provocative projects a chance to widen their appeal and increase their earning potential with a mainstream  . 3) The old \u201cGhostbusters\u201d isn\u2019t that great to begin with. WESLEY MORRIS You\u2019re right on all counts. Kate McKinnon joins my personal Taraji P.   Stone \u201cmore, please forever\u201d club. But the politics around  this movie have nothing to do with the politics in this movie, of which, to Mr. Feig\u2019s credit, there isn\u2019t very much. His \u201cGhostbusters\u201d isn\u2019t defensive so much as pro forma and strangely sedate compared with the original movie and to what else these women can do (and have done). My favorite moments involved the characters being let off their leashes, like when Kristen Wiig is running around New York trying to tell the mayor and whoever else won\u2019t listen that terror is afoot. That\u2019s a great mode for her. As for Ms. Jones\u2019s given occupation as a transit worker, it leaves me, once again, annoyed by the optics. If the other Ghostbusters were, say, Ms. Henson, Jada Pinkett Smith and Gabourey Sidibe as the scientists, and Ms. Jones\u2019s Patty was still the subway worker, who\u2019d care? But under the circumstances, it just seems like the same questionable,     choice that movies have always made for black performers  \u2014   and an excuse for the plot to ride the subway. But, look: She\u2019s an equal member of the team and black people work in public transit. Politics! What do we make of the movie\u2019s fetishization of Chris Hemsworth? He\u2019s very funny as himbo  . But somebody involved with this movie clearly thinks he\u2019s utterly captivating  \u2014   or politically necessary, too. A lot of the plot hinges on him being   funny. And I actually found the comedic material to be there for him in a way it wasn\u2019t for almost everyone else, especially Melissa McCarthy, who, maybe, shouldn\u2019t be a straight man after all. I wanted gonzo from this movie and got dutiful. What\u2019s wrong with me? MANOHLA DARGIS Gonzo is tough to find in the current   landscape, which is radically different from what it was when the first movie opened in 1984. Given this, I think the new \u201cGhostbusters\u201d succeeds on its own fairly narrow commercial mainstream terms, but with some dividends, including a pretty, ditsy secretary (Mr. Hemsworth) and the new Bill Murray (our collective crush, Ms. McKinnon). The only thing I would add is that Ms. McCarthy was already a significant   draw in 2014 when Mr. Feig tweeted that he was making an   \u201cGhostbusters. \u201d Oh, and one more thought: The most interesting thing about the reboot isn\u2019t the movie itself but the misogynistic discourse that has swirled around it since this project was announced. I did my best to ignore the   chatter before I saw \u201cGhostbusters\u201d just because I avoid reading anyone else\u2019s opinion about a movie before seeing it. I knew that there was a contingent of angry male fans of course there were. There are always men enraged by women\u2019s autonomy, whether women are starring in a comedy reboot or \u201cThelma  Louise\u201d playing rock or video games demanding their reproductive rights running for president or, you know, doing anything that some men don\u2019t want them to do. The depths of this rage betray a deep fear about a loss of male power that\u2019s been central to the cultural, social and political landscape for decades. \u201cGhostbusters\u201d turns on the threat of one apocalypse the irrational hatred toward it turns on another end time. SCOTT I think what pleased me most about this \u201cGhostbusters\u201d was how     \u2014   how chill  \u2014   the movie was, notwithstanding the bombast of the climactic battle. I think we all agree that it has a generic,     quality. That\u2019s something it shares with the original, by the way, which far from being a transcendent masterpiece of cinematic imagination was a nice paycheck for the artists involved and an easy, inoffensive night out for the audience. Sorry if I ruined anyone\u2019s childhood. Mr. Feig, like Ivan Reitman before him, has assembled a workmanlike   about people at work. Professionalism may be the opposite of gonzo, but I think there\u2019s something (dare I say it) radical about how   this story is. Here\u2019s a movie about female friendship and collegiality  \u2014   which, of course, also entails rivalry, miscommunication and shifting allegiances  \u2014   that feels no need to entangle any of its heroines in a heterosexual romance plot. Ms. Wiig\u2019s character is distracted by the hotness of her secretary (I was reminded of Zero Mostel in the original \u201cProducers\u201d) but the real emotional stakes are between her and Ms. McCarthy. We don\u2019t know if any of the Ghostbusters are gay, bi, straight, married, single, celibate, polyamorous or whatever. It\u2019s not relevant. Any more than it would be in a western or a platoon picture or a Mafia epic or a movie about a bunch of tech bros building a  . (    assignment: \u201cGhostbusters\u201d is actually a remake of \u201cThe Social Network. \u201d) \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d \u201cThe Heat\u201d and \u201cSpy\u201d may have had naughtier (and funnier) jokes, but they were also careful to include   flourishes and semiplausible love interests. \u201cGhostbusters\u201d doesn\u2019t do that. Nor does it pander to the male gaze. And it\u2019s not really out to prove that women can be strong or funny or handle powerful weapons. In most movies, such offers of proof are accompanied by reassurances that the women in question are still sexy or maternal or eager to settle down with the right guy  \u2014   that they fulfill some kind of conventional idea of femininity. \u201cGhostbusters\u201d doesn\u2019t bother with any of that, and in the process seems to be on the verge of inventing a new set of archetypes. MORRIS Well, the movie does pander to this male\u2019s gaze, at least in its appreciation of Mr. Hemsworth\u2019s presumed hotness. There\u2019s a randomness to this movie, much of which is devoted to him. (Why does he decide he wants to bust ghosts, too? What\u2019s with all those cheesecake, shirtless head shots that keep showing up?) Still, the more I think about it the more I feel like every word of opprobrium or defense  \u2014   every profane or besotted emoji  \u2014   has been in some ways unfair to a movie that just wants to be. But Tony, your ascribing meaning and value to the workplace dynamics really struck me. These women are   owners who love their jobs. (To paraphrase the eternal Ray Parker Jr.: Bustin\u2019 makes \u2019em feel good.) That\u2019s a strong contrast to something like \u201c9 to 5\u201d (1980) whose women hated work because their boss was a pig. Now there\u2019s no boss, just an endless supply of ghosts. Progress! My objection to this movie is purely an exasperation with remakes of stuff that no one needs. (People of the world, for the love of Netflix, your childhoods are still available on demand!) Nonetheless, Manohla, your enthusiasm  \u2014   and my friend Katie\u2019s  \u2014   won me over, at least in this case. This is an elastic concept that can withstand all kinds of reconfigurations. It\u2019s not sacred. And to the girls in the audience, who know nothing about the battles roiling their parents\u2019 Reddit feeds, the comedic quartet of McCarthy, Jones, Wiig and McKinnon is just business as usual. But that\u2019s a difference that feels entirely generational, no? DARGIS Maybe it\u2019s generational but it\u2019s also a matter of awareness. Because while a   blockbuster may seem like business as usual to some, reams of data prove that movies like this remain an exception in the   industry. To cite (again) just one bummer study: From 2007 to 2014, women made up 30. 2 percent of all speaking or named characters in the 100   fictional films released in the United States. And while there\u2019s certainly awareness about this sexism, at least in some quarters, that hasn\u2019t translated into real industry progress. For a big studio like Sony, and in an industrial climate in which male superheroes keep studios going, \u201cGhostbusters\u201d is a gamble. The studio tried to revive \u201cGhostbusters\u201d for years. In 2009, when Dan Aykroyd talked to The Los Angeles Times about what was then \u201cGhostbusters 3\u201d (meaning another sequel, not a reboot) female Ghostbusters were part of the story. This iteration would star the original cast and involve the older Ghostbusters passing the proton torch to a new group that included some women. Mr. Aykroyd specifically mentioned Alyssa Milano and Eliza Dushku, casting that was eagerly greeted on some entertainment sites. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they have BOTH of them in the movie? That way they can towel the slime off each other,\u201d wrote one commentator on Screenrant. \u201cSlime her!\u201d a writer for Cinemablend enthused about Ms. Milano. Entertainment Weekly even ran a story  \u2014   \u201cPick the New \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 Girl!\u201d  \u2014   with a photo of Megan Fox, who it suggested could be \u201cThe Sexpot\u201d alongside Zoe Saldana (\u201cThe Geek Queen\u201d) Emma Watson (\u201cThe Touch of Class\u201d) and Charlyne Yi (\u201cThe Wild Card\u201d) who has \u201cjust the right   charm for the Ghostbusters crew. \u201d The stars of the new \u201cGhostbusters\u201d are adult women  \u2014   three over 40  \u2014   they\u2019re not girls or especially charming. And while some moviegoers may not need this particular remake, I think there are plenty of girl and women moviegoers who would say, yes, we do.'"}, "time": 1742562818.7798533}
