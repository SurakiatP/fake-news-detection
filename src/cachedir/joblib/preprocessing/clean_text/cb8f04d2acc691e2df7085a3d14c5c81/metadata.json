At airports around the world, the legal tug of war played out in starkly human terms, with travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries having to decide whether to board flights to the United States, unsure of whether they would be turned back once they landed. Yet here, in the cosseted confines of    those concerns seemed a million miles away. The guests had gathered for the 60th annual Red Cross ball, a staple of the Palm Beach social calendar, which this year carried the theme \u201cFrom Vienna to Versailles. \u201d In keeping with the Hapsburg and Bourbon motif, the male staff members wore powdered wigs and breeches the women were costumed in flouncy gowns and   beehive wigs in the style of Marie Antoinette, the queen guillotined in the French Revolution. The disconnect between high society and huddled masses would have been complete if not for the fact that   \u2019s proprietor  \u2014   the guest of honor that evening, though he had to stand in line with his wife to get into his own ballroom  \u2014   was the very person who had signed the immigration order and had gone to court to preserve it: Mr. Trump. \u201cWe\u2019ll win,\u201d the president said to a reporter on   duty, who asked him whether he was confident of the government\u2019s legal appeal. \u201cFor the safety of the country, we\u2019ll win. \u201d When another reporter asked whether he would abide by the federal court\u2019s ruling, Mr. Trump smiled thinly but did not answer, shifting from foot to foot, as the first lady, Melania Trump, resplendent in a pink evening gown and diamond and emerald earrings, stared serenely ahead. This is    in the first month of the Trump presidency, still making the transition from a   club for the tanned and surgically enhanced snowbirds of Florida\u2019s Gold Coast to the \u201cwinter White House\u201d that the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post always dreamed it would be after she built the   castle in the 1920s. Like his residence, Mr. Trump is also still in transition, caught between the demands of being president (a 5 p. m. phone call with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine) and the reassuring rituals of his old life (a round of golf at his club in nearby West Palm Beach). On his first weekend here since being inaugurated, the Red Cross ball fell into the   category. He had hosted the benefit several times over the past 20 years, said Dick Robinson, a friend and Palm Beach philanthropist, who stopped by to chat with the White House press corps, which now shows up alongside reporters from the local papers to chronicle events like this. The sight of Mr. Trump lining up with his guests was remarkable, given that presidents normally enter a room only after everyone else is seated, and then often to the strains of \u201cHail to the Chief. \u201d With his tuxedo jacket unbuttoned, clutching his wife\u2019s hand, he looked more like the   who spent years greeting the guests at his club. And yet there were myriad other signs of how Mr. Trump\u2019s life has changed, from the security checkpoint set up in an adjacent parking lot and the police boat that bobs in the Intracoastal Waterway to the Secret Service agents who peered into the crowd as he and Mrs. Trump shimmied to a band playing Bob Seger\u2019s \u201cOld Time Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s weekend also had that    vibe that most presidential getaways have. In addition to the call with Mr. Poroshenko, he spoke to Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy, Prime Minister Bill English of New Zealand and the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg  \u2014   a conversation that could not have been relaxing, given Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier assertions that the alliance is a Cold War relic. In its   summary of the Ukraine call, the White House described the exchange with Mr. Poroshenko as \u201cvery good\u201d and quoted Mr. Trump as saying, \u201cWe will work with Ukraine, Russia and other parties to help them restore peace along the border\u201d  \u2014   a statement that did not take account of the fact that Russia unlawfully annexed Crimea. Mr. Trump brought along his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, which suggested that he was briefed regularly on the legal battle over his immigration order. Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon both stayed at    which has guest rooms. Even when Mr. Trump was off the clock, he appeared preoccupied by the world outside. On Saturday morning, he began a Twitter tirade against the Seattle judge who had blocked the immigration order. Though he went quiet during the four and a half hours he was at the Trump International Golf Club  \u2014   the White House declined to confirm that he actually played golf or say who his partners were  \u2014   the Twitter posts resumed when he got back to the house. Even as his guests were mingling during cocktails, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cThe judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interest at heart. Bad people are very happy!\u201d When Mr. Trump bought    at a   price in 1985, he was viewed by many in this uppity enclave as a parvenu who would cheapen the legacy of the estate. Those days are gone  \u2014   especially now that he has the power to make his friends ambassadors to European capitals. But Mr. Trump still draws his share of catcalls  \u2014   some subtle, others not. Across the street from his golf club, the Palm Beach County Library had a sign in the front door advertising an evening with Amy Sherman, a reporter from The Miami Herald and PolitiFact Florida, to discuss how to expose disingenuous political figures. \u201cPants on Fire: How to   Politicians,\u201d it said. On Saturday, about 3, 000 demonstrators marched along Flagler Drive, carrying signs and chanting, \u201c    Donald Trump has got to go. \u201d About 300 managed to walk across the bridge to Palm Beach, according to The Palm Beach Post, where they got within 25 yards of    before encountering an armored security vehicle. At 8 p. m. when the fireworks exploded above the estate, they cast a glow on the crowd, witnesses said, giving them a better view of the show than the one enjoyed by the guests inside Mr. Trump\u2019s winter White House.'"}, "time": 1742563366.9691765}
