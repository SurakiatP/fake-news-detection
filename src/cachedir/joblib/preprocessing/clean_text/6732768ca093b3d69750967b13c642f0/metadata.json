Officials and witnesses said the floodwaters rushed through the downtown area after torrential rain fell between 7 and 9 p. m. It ripped up sidewalks, gutted many of the town\u2019s quaint shops and carried off vehicles, depositing some of them blocks away. The body of a woman was recovered from the nearby Patapsco River early on Sunday, and the body of a man was also found, said Mark Miller, a spokesman for Howard County, where Ellicott City is the county seat. \u201cThis was a different type of flooding than you would normally get when just the Patapsco rises  \u2014   far more devastating,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the water was a piston. The water came through with such force. \u201d Gov. Larry Hogan and Representative Elijah E. Cummings visited the destruction early on Sunday. Mr. Hogan signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for Howard County. Mr. Cummings, who has an office on Main Street, said in a statement that the flooding had \u201cdevastated countless businesses and residents in Ellicott City. \u201d \u201cRecovering from this disaster will be long and difficult,\u201d he said. The downtown area has been evacuated and closed off while emergency crews assess the safety of the buildings there. County officials asked residents to be patient during what some anticipated would be a monthslong rebuilding process. Founded in 1772 as a mill town, Ellicott City has for the past several decades catered to tourists with its historic charm and antique shops, said Shawn Gladden, the executive director of the Howard County Historical Society. The town\u2019s location in the Patapsco River Valley has made it susceptible to flooding. On Sunday, some of its roughly 65, 000 residents were already drawing comparisons to the two biggest floods in its recorded history, the flood of 1868 and flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. \u201cThey call them the   floods,\u201d Mr. Gladden said. \u201cAnd this one may rival that. \u201d The National Weather Service had issued warnings about potential floods on Saturday, and at one point sent a sharply worded bulletin: \u201cThis is a particularly dangerous situation. Seek higher ground now!\u201d Despite the warnings, the ferocity of the waters came as a surprise to many workers and residents in downtown Ellicott City, trapping them where they were. Inside Bean Hollow, the water rose swiftly to about three feet. With no time to flee, the coffee shop\u2019s workers scrambled to an apartment on the second floor. \u201cThis was a true flash flood,\u201d said Jim Bolton, who has owned Bean Hollow with his wife for about 14 years. \u201cBy the time people realized there was a potential hazard, it was far too late for anyone to do anything. \u201d Mr. Bolton said he expected the rebuilding of Ellicott City to be a long road. \u201cIt\u2019s decimated right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly had its share of floods and fires and all sorts of madness over the years. It will rise again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564530.1426384}
