At 2:30 a. m. as the light show was peaking, the two men sat on a grassy bluff here in the Wet Mountain Valley of southern Colorado, swaddled in blankets against the chilly mountain air and looking up at the stars in the torrent of the Milky Way. Every few seconds, a tiny chunk of space ice cast off by Comet   would blaze through Earth\u2019s atmosphere, silently streaking through the darkness. \u201cThere\u2019s one!\u201d the men called out. \u201cAnd another!\u201d \u201cI saw that. \u201d Night skies like this one are disappearing across much of the world, nibbled away by the   glow of city lights. American skies are no different. Four out of five Americans live in places where they can no longer see the Milky Way. But here, the tiny neighboring ranching and railroad towns of Westcliffe (population 568) and Silver Cliff (population 587) have decided to tap into the dwindling natural resource of darkness. The old silver mines that once made Silver Cliff Colorado\u2019s   town are long closed, and many ranchers are retiring. But there is still the night. So for more than a decade, the two towns and a local   nonprofit have been dialing down the dimmer switch. They have replaced streetlights and passed rules requiring that outdoor lights point down. The group built a small observatory with star guides who tee up its telescope and take people on a tour of the night. They coax homeowners to hood their porch lamps or dim a bright light outside their house. \u201cPeople out of ignorance go with whatever\u2019s cheap or whatever\u2019s brightest,\u201d said Ed Stewart, a board member of the local   group. \u201cYou multiply that by 200, 300, and there goes the sky. \u201d He said advocates met with homeowners\u2019 associations and held stargazing parties to sell the virtues of the night. When they gaze over the valley and see winking floodlights on a ranch or home in the hills, they see their next targets of persuasion. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go up to someone and say, you\u2019ve got a bad light, and legislate the problem away,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople resist that, especially in Colorado. \u201d The mayor of Westcliffe, Christy Patterson, said she once got a phone call complaining that her garage light was too bright. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have the light on,\u201d she said. In 2012, Mr. Stewart said a new store opened in town that flouted the area\u2019s nighttime sensitivities and became a glowing eyesore. He said people in the community wrote letters to the editor, urging the store\u2019s manager to change the lighting until, finally, the store relented. \u201cWe feel like they\u2019re a part of the community now,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. Last year, the International   Association, a nonprofit working to stop light pollution, rewarded their efforts by designating the two towns among a handful of   communities. Lovers of the night cheered  \u2014   they had put their community on the map by blotting themselves out. A trickle of amateur stargazers have taken notice and have started to visit, telescopes in tow. When you drive into either town, the streets are not  . Streetlights and porch lights glow along the main street, where photos of   ranches are posted on the front windows of real estate offices. But viewed from the mountain pass above the towns, Westcliffe and Silver Cliff look less like an island of light than a constellation in the dark valley. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many towns, even small towns, where you can stand in town limits and see the Milky Way like that,\u201d Mr. Linderer, 69, said from his camping chair. He and his wife, Margaret, who baked chocolate chip cookie squares for Friday\u2019s stargazing, moved here a decade ago. \u201cI moved here because of this,\u201d said Mr. Jarvis, 71, who retired here from Houston three years ago. \u201cSo did I,\u201d said Mr. Linderer. To the west, toward the Sangre de Cristo range, a pack of coyotes yipped as another streak flashed across the sky.'"}, "time": 1742563232.6789427}
