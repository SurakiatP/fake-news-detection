[Oh no, wait. It wasn\u2019t Al Gore. My bad. It was actually Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Shell speaking at an oil industry gathering at the U. S. oil capital of Houston.  Now do you see why I so hate Big Oil? Well, partly it\u2019s bitterness. For many years now, I  \u2014   and many sceptics like me  \u2014   have been accused by climate alarmists of being \u201cin the pay of Big Oil\u201d. But even though we deserve it for promoting fossil fuels so enthusiastically and fighting their critics so heroically, few of us have ever received even a penny for our troubles. That\u2019s because Big Oil is far too busy trying to greenwash its image  \u2014   as Shell itself did by sponsoring the Guardian\u2019s environment pages for many years  \u2014   to waste time on the plucky, outspoken heroes who do a better job for Big Oil\u2019s PR than the Big Oil\u2019s paid PR departments do. Mainly, though it\u2019s disgust. Big Oil has this public image of being an industry for fearless,   manly men who aren\u2019t afraid of getting their hands dirty or braving the environmentalists\u2019 wrath in order to do their ugly but important work supplying the world with   energy. Yet it\u2019s an image almost entirely undeserved. Almost everyone at a senior level in Big Oil is a craven, simpering, politically correct, spineless,   corporate shill. They\u2019re cowards who are scared of free markets, won\u2019t speak up for capitalism, won\u2019t even defend their core business. Typical of this attitude was the current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. One of his first moves on becoming CEO of Exxon in 2006 was to announce it would stop funding organisations like the Competitive Enterprise Institute \u201cwhose position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure the energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner. \u201d Unlike his punchier predecessor Lee Raymond, Tillerson clearly decided that discretion being the better part of valor, he would throw his industry\u2019s supporters to the wolves. One of the first big energy stories I covered for Breitbart was the incredible true story of how Chevron Oil fought off a $9. 5 billion damages case filed on behalf of Ecuadorean natives whose lands had supposedly been polluted as a result of Chevron\u2019s negligence. The truly incredible part of the story was that Chevron decided to defend the case. The more usual position of Big Oil is to surrender as soon as possible and settle out of court. If Big Oil won\u2019t speak out for the oil industry, who will? Sadly, the burden invariably falls to that small group of maverick believers in free markets and honest science who don\u2019t care about all the brickbats they get for being defenders of \u201cdirty fuel\u201d because they\u2019d rather speak the truth than be popular. Among them is Steve Milloy who, May 2008, intervened in an Exxon shareholder meeting on behalf of all those shareholders who think that Exxon\u2019s core business should be drilling oil and creating value for shareholders  \u2014   not getting distracted by trying to make themselves look cuter for their Watermelon (green on the outside, red on the inside) critics. Follow this link and you can hear the huge round applause Milloy won from shareholders when he proposed that Exxon should amend its   so that it no longer had to waste time on politicised interventions from \u201cnuisance shareholders\u201d. Stock ownership has become politicized. Many shareholders own stock in   corporations for the sole purpose of advancing the shareholders\u2019 own social or political agendas, while simultaneously assailing the corporations\u2019 legitimate business operations. These activist shareholders are \u201cnuisance shareholders. \u201d A primary tool of nuisance shareholders is the submission of   precatory (advisory) proposals for discussion and vote at annual meetings of shareholders. Proposals from nuisance shareholders can coerce management into making decisions not in the best interests of the Company and its bona fide shareholders, and turn the annual meeting into a   circus. You\u2019d think Exxon would have been grateful for this fire support from their public. Not one bit. We can see this from Exxon\u2019s response to a submission from Milloy that he intends to make a similar proposal at Exxon\u2019s next shareholder meeting this May. They applied to the SEC to try to get Milloy\u2019s proposal excluded. Happily, the SEC\u2019s lawyer wasn\u2019t having it.  It goes without saying that Exxon, like Shell, like most Big Oil companies, like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is now using its influence to try to prevent President Trump to fulfil his campaign trail promise to withdraw the U. S. from the UN Paris Climate Agreement. Ostensibly their excuse is that it would be bad for US international relations and \u201csend the wrong signals\u201d. In reality, it\u2019s for the worst of reasons. First, it\u2019s because spinelessness is an integral part of their corporate culture: they\u2019ve spent years surrendering to the green movement by paying it Danegeld and by paying lip service to its eco pieties  \u2014   and they\u2019re not about to grow a pair just because Donald Trump is president. Second, it\u2019s because they\u2019re so heavily diversified into   sectors like \u201crenewables\u201d and into unproven but lucrative technologies like Carbon Capture and Storage that they can\u2019t afford the massive hit they\u2019d suffer if Trump were to sever all ties with the Climate Industrial Complex. Big Oil is evil all right but not in the way the Greenies would have you think. It\u2019s because, heeding the voices of the industry\u2019s Wormtongues, Big Oil surrendered to the dark forces of Eco Mordor. It makes you hope that the smaller scale producers of the global fracking industry go from strength to strength  \u2014   and make the politically correct Big Oil monoliths history.'"}, "time": 1742564154.7523656}
