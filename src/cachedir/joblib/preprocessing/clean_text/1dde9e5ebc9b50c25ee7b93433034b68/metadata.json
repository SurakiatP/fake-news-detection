The unprecedented decision opened up and energized France\u2019s presidential race even as it added further turmoil to the country\u2019s unsettled politics. It also injected new uncertainty into the political dynamic of Europe as   and populist forces are gaining strength across the Continent, as well as in the United States. Mr. Hollande had kept France in suspense for months over whether he would seek another term, turning his choice into a kind of national guessing game. His surprise decision  \u2014   he had been expected to run  \u2014   was the latest in a series of shocks to French and European politics, which have been upended throughout the year by voter discontent with establishment governance, Mr. Hollande\u2019s included. The announcement  \u2014   issued by the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the seat of the presidency  \u2014   was greeted across the political spectrum as a courageous and dignified decision that, as Mr. Hollande himself made clear, was intended to place the interests of the country above his own. \u201cAs a Socialist, because that is my life\u2019s commitment, I cannot accept, I cannot come to terms with the dispersion of the left, with its splitting up,\u201d Mr. Hollande said in a somber statement. \u201cBecause that would remove all hope of winning in the face of conservatism and, worse yet, of extremism. \u201d So low had his ratings fallen  \u2014   Mr. Hollande plumbed historic depths in some surveys, going as low as 4 percent  \u2014   that many of his own Socialist colleagues had warned publicly that he was headed for certain defeat if he chose to run. More than that, hanging on to the mantle of   for the Socialists threatened to bring the party down with him, rendering it all but irrelevant in elections next spring. That prospect had split his own political grouping wide open. He was even forced to submit to a humiliating primary election  \u2014   also without precedent  \u2014   to decide who would be the party\u2019s candidate. Several of his former cabinet ministers had already announced they would run against him. Now, with Mr. Hollande out, the Socialists are thought to have improved their chances, even if only slightly. His    prime minister, Manuel Valls, is likely to step up as a leading contender in the primary. Mr. Valls is associated with a kind of toughness that analysts and citizens found lacking in Mr. Hollande, and that could help him compete in the general election against candidates from the right. Those now include a former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who was chosen on Sunday by the   Republican Party\u2019s voters, and the   National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen. Both have ridden a wave of nationalist fervor, anger over immigration and worries about Islamist terrorism, and Mr. Valls has sounded similarly   themes. At the same time, Mr. Valls could be tainted by his association with Mr. Hollande\u2019s administration, which has been a study in the slow slipping away of authority. For years an unremarkable Socialist functionary who rose slowly through the ranks, waiting for his turn, Mr. Hollande owed his narrow election in 2012 more to disgust with the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, than to any personal appeal he exerted. Still, the French left was delighted that after years in the political wilderness, it finally had an apparent champion in Mr. Hollande. But he never settled on a clear line of policy. First he campaigned as an   Socialist, with threats against finance. Once in office, he quickly veered to giving tax breaks to companies. Finally, he tried to push through a   overhaul, but largely backed down after huge street protests. Personal scandals did not help. His image as a leader was severely weakened early on when he was photographed on the back of a motorcycle going to a clandestine tryst with an actress. A   separation from his   partner followed, as well as a   book by her. He then dealt himself a final, perhaps fatal, blow by spending hours confiding the inner workings of his presidency to a pair of journalists. Their book of his confessions, published this fall, was greeted with outrage by members of his party, who were baffled that the man who held the country\u2019s highest office would commit such an act of political suicide. It also made clear that he held basic doubts about socialism, enraging what was left of the party\u2019s rank and file. Analysts have long pointed to Mr. Hollande\u2019s ideological fuzziness  \u2014   dangerous for a politician faced with a French electorate that has historically demanded clarity and authority from its top leader. But it was his failure to make a dent in France\u2019s unemployment rate  \u2014   much higher than the national figure of 10 percent among youth in some immigrant suburbs, where it approaches 40 percent  \u2014   that was perhaps the most decisive blow to his presidency. Months ago, Mr. Hollande suggested that he would not run again if he could not bring it down. He made good on that promise Thursday night. \u201cThe major commitment I made to you was to lower the unemployment rate,\u201d a melancholy Mr. Hollande said on national television from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Thursday night. \u201cAnd I devoted to that, with my government, all of my energy, took all of the risks. \u201d \u201cI lowered taxes on companies, because that\u2019s what is needed to create more jobs. I worked to boost hiring, making worker training a top priority,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. \u201cAnd I took the responsibility to reform the labor market. The results are there  \u2014   later than I had said that would be, I admit, but they are there. \u201d Actually, though, unemployment has not budged significantly during Mr. Hollande\u2019s term. Otherwise, his short speech was a dutiful laundry list of the things he said he had accomplished: legalizing   marriage, the Paris climate accord, help for schools, reorganizing France\u2019s local governments. It all lacked a defining stamp, as Mr. Hollande himself appeared to recognize. There was a sense of relief in the immediate reactions of his Socialist colleagues. \u201cThis was a difficult choice, reflective and serious,\u201d Mr. Valls said. \u201cI want to express to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande my emotion, my respect, my loyalty and my affection,\u201d Mr. Valls added. He did not announce his own candidacy, but he has been suggesting that he might do so soon. The National Front reacted with glee and mockery to Mr. Hollande\u2019s decision, even though it is now likely to face a much tougher Socialist opponent next year. \u201cIt was smart, smart of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,\u201d said Florian Philippot, a top National Front official. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for France and the French. It says much about the sense of weariness, the deliquescence, of this term. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628336.8376646}
