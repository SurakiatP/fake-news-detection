He went on to say, \u201cHillary IS that bad\u201d, and he should know. He has worked on the Benghazi Committee, as well as the investigation into her use of a private email server and the deletion of more than 30,000 emails from that account. \\nChaffetz is the Representative from Utah, and he is as reputable as anyone you will find in today\u2019s corrupt government. He did find confusion as to whom he would vote for, as he was disappointed with Trump when the widely distributed \u201csex tape\u201d came out. It threw him, but he simply cannot vote for Hillary, as he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt she is bad to the bone and will lead this Country into further destruction. I will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump , but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad. HRC is bad for the USA. \\n\u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 27, 2016 \\nRepublican congressman Jason Chaffetz, who hails from the newly-minted toss-up state of Utah, seemingly has had a change of heart: He now says he will indeed vote for Donald Trump . \\n\u201cI will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump, but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad. HRC is bad for the USA,\u201d Chaffetz tweeted Wednesday night.'"}, "time": 1742563235.188155}
