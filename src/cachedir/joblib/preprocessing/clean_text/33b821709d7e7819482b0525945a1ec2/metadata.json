There\u2019s also a wheelchair onstage at a small theater not far away, and it\u2019s drawing practically no attention at all. The gulf between the two says quite a lot. At the Belasco, the Broadway house on West 44th Street, the wheelchair is one of the conspicuous elaborations the director Sam Gold has brought to his production of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie,\u201d the beloved Tennessee Williams drama. The chair isn\u2019t just a prop it\u2019s a necessity for the actress playing Laura, Madison Ferris, who has muscular dystrophy. That bit of casting is, of course, a significant change from the shy girl with a limp that Williams called for in his play. And Mr. Gold\u2019s staging leaves no doubt that Ms. Ferris is not some   actress pretending to have a disability. He has her enter by painstakingly climbing stairs, one of several times that he takes her out of the wheelchair and confronts the audience with the difficulties of having severely limited mobility. Some leading critics have objected to the transformation of Williams\u2019s subtle play about a family enveloped in denial into something more strident. The kindest objections say that Mr. Gold\u2019s interpretation simply doesn\u2019t mesh well with the text harsher ones on theater chat boards have called his use of Ms. Ferris exploitative. Perhaps these detractors are focusing on moments like the one in which Amanda, Laura\u2019s mother, tells her: \u201cYou\u2019re not crippled. You just have a little defect  \u2014   hardly noticeable, even!\u201d How can such a line make sense when there\u2019s a wheelchair onstage? For one thing, this is a   \u201cmemory play,\u201d told through the recollections of Laura\u2019s brother, Tom (played by Joe Mantello). And memory is an interpretation of the past, not a literal playback of it. But, more than that, to live with a child with a disability is to be both isolated  \u2014   as this family is  \u2014   and susceptible to what seems to others like an unreality. My own daughter, who has a serious disability called Rett syndrome, is just three years younger than the    Laura. Is it easy for me to imagine a parent who sees a vastly different child than the outside world sees? You bet. As for the charge of exploitation, I read that as, \u201cIt was unpleasant to see Ms. Ferris pull herself along the floor by her arms I prefer that people with disabilities remain invisible, as they so often are. \u201d Broadway audiences are accustomed to seeing perfect bodies doing entertaining dance steps. Guess what, Broadway? One in five Americans has a disability, according to the census bureau. Nine blocks north and four blocks west of the Belasco, at the A. R. T.  York Theaters, Theater Breaking Through Barriers has a program of shorts running through Sunday. The company, which has been around since 1979, stages productions using actors with disabilities as well as   actors. The five plays on its current program include works by Neil LaBute and Bekah Brunstetter, a producer of the TV series \u201cThis Is Us. \u201d Nicholas Viselli, the company\u2019s artistic director, has put quirky interstitials between the plays  \u2014   a song, some monologues. Ryan Haddad, who is gay and has cerebral palsy, steals the show with a funny, deeply personal piece called \u201cHi, Are You Single?\u201d This is the type of production that\u2019s most likely to showcase actors with disabilities: intimate theater, small audience, $25 ticket. The program (which is called \u201cThe Other Plays: Short Plays About Diversity and Otherness\u201d) is   but it feels 1, 000 miles from the mainstream represented by the Belasco, where the best seat for \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d can set you back more than $200. Mr. Gold\u2019s brashest stroke in a production full of them may be the bridging of that divide  \u2014   taking a theatrical universe that has existed for some time on the outskirts and putting it on a Broadway marquee featuring the   names of Mr. Mantello and Sally Field, who plays Amanda. He\u2019s not the first to do so  \u2014   think back, for instance, to the breathtaking Deaf West reimagining of \u201cBig River\u201d in 2003, featuring a lot of deaf and    actors and sign language, or to the same company\u2019s 2015 \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d (which also had an actor who uses a wheelchair). But it remains a rare occurrence, and as a result Broadway remains unrepresentative of the full range of humanity. So do television, film and most other forms, though inroads are being made there, too. Does the casting of an actor with cerebral palsy to play a character with cerebral palsy on the ABC sitcom \u201cSpeechless\u201d seem manipulative? How about the coming introduction of a character with autism on \u201cSesame Street?\u201d Sometimes, what seems a cheesy gimmick or instance of exploitation is really just the front edge of needed change. Some theatergoers were probably outraged the first time a black Juliet was cast against a white Romeo. Did that change how some of Shakespeare\u2019s lines registered and imbue the play with new meanings? Sure. Is   casting now widely accepted and the theatergoing experience richer for it? Yes. Mr. Gold\u2019s production is hardly perfect. If you figure out that thing with keeping the house lights up for a third of the show, let me know. But at least with the Laura character, he has done what he intended. \u201cI\u2019m not very interested in pretend,\u201d he has said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in putting people onstage. I want people. And I want a world that reflects the real world. \u201d It\u2019s worth contemplating what that means from the audience\u2019s perspective. On those chat boards, some writers have complained that Ms. Ferris isn\u2019t very good. Here\u2019s the thing: We have been conditioned to define good acting in terms of facial expressions, comic timing, physical bits. An actor with a disability, especially one involving muscle control or cognitive impairment, isn\u2019t necessarily going to be able to give the kind of performance we\u2019re used to. Will Ms. Ferris impress someone looking for that kind of performance? Probably not. But she gives the most realistic portrayal of a person with muscular dystrophy that I\u2019ve ever seen. In any case, the overall package worked for me and showed me a different play, just as Deaf West did with \u201cBig River,\u201d one of my favorite musicals. The Amanda of this \u201cMenagerie\u201d is more in denial than other Amandas the gentleman caller, played by Finn Wittrock, who sees past Laura\u2019s disability, is all the nobler. And  \u2014   especially given the time frame of the play, an era before curb cuts and the Americans With Disabilities Act, Tom\u2019s decision to leave his family is not so much a personal liberation as a cruel abandonment. I don\u2019t really care whether this is what Williams intended. What I admire is the attempt, and the fact that this production has people talking about something other than whether Ms. Field\u2019s Amanda is better or worse than Cherry Jones\u2019s in 2013 or Jessica Lange\u2019s in 2005. Debates like that are the product of a theater of complacency. Debates like the one Mr. Gold has unleashed are what keep theater vigorous and challenging.'"}, "time": 1742564223.472249}
