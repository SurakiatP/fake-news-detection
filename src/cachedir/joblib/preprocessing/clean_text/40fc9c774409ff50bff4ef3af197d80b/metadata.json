In his victory speech Tuesday evening, it was that \u201cthe only card she has is the women\u2019s card. \u201d He said that \u201cif Hillary Clinton were a man, I don\u2019t think she would get 5 percent of the vote. \u201d In his telling, the women\u2019s card confers an enormous advantage. Indeed, current    polls between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have her with 55 percent of the   vote, suggesting that he believes the women\u2019s card is worth 50 points. That\u2019s nearly enough to assure any female candidate of victory. Yet this appears to be inconsistent with available data. Over the past decade, women have been elected to 17. 5 percent of House seats, meaning that they\u2019re outnumbered by men by roughly five to one. In fact, the women\u2019s card appears to be particularly unhelpful in the United States. Women\u2019s success in politics  \u2014   at least as measured by the proportion of seats they hold in the House compared with equivalent lower chambers in other nations  \u2014   ranks below that of nearly every other rich country. The United States is positioned between Greece and Bangladesh. Of course, Mr. Trump might object that he\u2019s not talking about House seats, but rather the presidency. Even there, the women\u2019s card appears quite unhelpful, as The Upshot\u2019s extensive search through United States data failed to locate a single woman who had ever been president.'"}, "time": 1742628595.1505294}
