The Pentagon announced no immediate changes, but supporters of Trump\u2019s decision say it will sweep away a veil of political obfuscation President Obama placed over troop deployments. [To put it bluntly, the Obama administration did not honestly report how many U. S. \u201cboots on the ground\u201d were placed in Iraq and Syria. As Reuters explains:  The Force Management Level system was introduced in Iraq and Syria during Barack Obama\u2019s administration as a way to exert control over the military. Obama periodically raised FML limits to allow more troops in Iraq and Syria as the campaign against Islamic State advanced. But the numbers did not reflect the extent of the U. S. commitment on the ground since commanders found often    ways to work around the limits  \u2014   sometimes bringing in forces temporarily or hiring more contractors. The force management levels, which are officially at 5, 262 in Iraq and 503 in Syria, are believed to be more than a couple of thousands troops shy of the actual number of U. S. forces in both countries. \u201cWe want our reporting to Congress and to the public to be more easily and clearly understood,\u201d said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White. \u201cWe will conduct a review to ensure that the numbers we provide to Congress and to the public accurately reflect the facts on the ground. This is about transparency. \u201d One particular area of clarity mentioned in the Pentagon\u2019s announcement is the number of troops on \u201ctemporary\u201d deployment. In the past, such temporary assignments were a convenient way to bypass the troop limits without admitting more American personnel were being deployed to the Iraq and Syrian theaters since \u201ctemporary\u201d deployments didn\u2019t count. \u201cBringing the authority really back here where it\u2019s historically been enables military commanders to be more agile, to more quickly and efficiently support partners, to have more rapid   and to keep units together,\u201d said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis. The Pentagon emphasized that it plans to continue its focus on training and equipping local forces, rather than dramatically increasing the number of U. S. troops in the region. As Reuters goes on to point out, President Obama\u2019s deception was not only directed at domestic audiences. Hostile entities in Iraq and Syria, notably   militia leaders like Shiite imam Moqtada   are already agitating for fewer American troops in the battle to recapture Mosul from ISIS. A larger U. S. footprint could mean political problems for the Iraqi government. Military. com calls Trump\u2019s order a \u201cmajor reversal of Obama administration policy\u201d and wonders if Secretary of Defense James Mattis will eventually have the authority to deploy more troops to Afghanistan where the security situation has been degrading steadily, and South Korea, where the security situation might degrade rather abruptly. The change announced by the Trump White House and Pentagon is limited to Iraq and Syria at the moment. \u201cThe decision by Trump to delegate more authority to Mattis followed complaints by three defense secretaries who served under Obama  \u2014   Robert Gates, Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel  \u2014   about being \u2018micromanaged\u2019 by White House officials on military matters,\u201d Military. com notes.'"}, "time": 1742562952.7496455}
