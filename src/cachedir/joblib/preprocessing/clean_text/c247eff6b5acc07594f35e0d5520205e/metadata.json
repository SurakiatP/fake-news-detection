Trump in Spain, screaming \u201cgrab patriarchy by the balls\u201d. [The protestors, from the infamous Ukrainian group FEMEN, grabbed the statue in the crotch area at the event at the Wax Museum of Madrid on Tuesday.  The activist group claimed responsibility for the protest on Twitter, saying: \u201cFEMEN just grabbed Trump\u2019s statue by the balls in Madrid. \u201d According to Reuters, Museum staff spent several minutes trying to restrain the woman before eventually bundling her out through a back door. FEMEN describes their \u201cideology\u201d as \u201cSextremism\u201d \u201cAtheism\u201d and \u201cFeminism\u201d and have become renowned for holding provocative topless protests in churches and other places. Their \u201cobjectives\u201d include \u201cprovok[ing] patriarchy into open conflict by forcing it to disclose its aggressive antihuman nature to fully discredit it in the eyes of history\u201d and \u201cpromot[ing] new revolutionary female sexuality as opposed to the patriarchal erotic and pornography. Gonzalo Presa, head of communications at the museum, called the woman\u2019s protest \u201cunpleasant\u201d and said he had hoped to give a \u201cspecial welcome\u201d to Donald Trump from Madrid. \u201cIf they want to do this they should do it directly to him. This is too easy,\u201d he told a Reuters reporter. Explaining their \u201cideology\u201d the group claim on their website: \u201cSextremism is female sexuality rebelling against patriarchy and embodied in the extremal political direct action events. \u201cSexist style of the actions is a way to destruct the patriarchal understanding of what is the destination of female sexuality to the benefit of the great revolutionary mission. \u201cExtremal nature of sextremism demonstrates intellectual, psychological and physical superiority of female activists from FEMEN over the bandogs of patriarchy. \u201cUnsanctioned format of the sextremism events represents the historical right of the woman to make her protest anywhere at any time and not to concert her action with the patriarchal   structures. \u201cSextremism is the woman\u2019s mockery of vulgar male extremism and its bloody mayhems and a cult of terror. \u201cSextremism is a   but highly aggressive form of provocation it is an   demoralizing weapon undermining the foundations of the old political ethics and rotten patriarchal culture. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628525.673074}
