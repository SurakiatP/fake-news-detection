Trump\u2019s inauguration. Jennifer Willis no longer plans to be one of them. Ms. Willis, a    wedding minister from South Carolina, had looked forward to taking her daughters to the march. Then she read a post on the Facebook page for the march that made her feel unwelcome because she is white. The post, written by a black activist from Brooklyn who is a march volunteer, advised \u201cwhite allies\u201d to listen more and talk less. It also chided those who, it said, were only now waking up to racism because of the election. \u201cYou don\u2019t just get to join because now you\u2019re scared, too,\u201d read the post. \u201cI was born scared. \u201d Stung by the tone, Ms. Willis canceled her trip. \u201cThis is a women\u2019s march,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be allies in equal pay, marriage, adoption. Why is it now about, \u2018White women don\u2019t understand black women\u2019?\u201d If all goes as planned, the Jan. 21 march will be a momentous display of unity in protest of a president whose treatment of women came to dominate the campaign\u2019s final weeks. But long before the first buses roll to Washington and sister demonstrations take place in other cities, contentious conversations about race have erupted nearly every day among marchers, exhilarating some and alienating others. In Tennessee, emotions ran high when organizers changed the name of the local march from \u201cWomen\u2019s March on  \u201d to \u201cPower Together Tennessee, in solidarity with Women\u2019s March on Washington. \u201d While many applauded the name change, which was meant to signal the start of a new social justice movement in Nashville, some complained that the event had turned from a march for all women into a march for black women. In Louisiana, the first state coordinator gave up her volunteer role in part because there were no minority women in leadership positions at that time. \u201cI got a lot of flak locally when I stepped down, from white women who said that I\u2019m alienating a lot of white women,\u201d said Candice Huber, a bookstore owner in New Orleans, who is white. \u201cThey said, \u2018Why do you have to be so divisive? \u2019\u201d In some ways, the discord is by design. Even as they are working to ensure a smooth and unified march next week, the national organizers said they made a deliberate decision to highlight the plight of minority and undocumented immigrant women and provoke uncomfortable discussions about race. \u201cThis was an opportunity to take the conversation to the deep places,\u201d said Linda Sarsour, a Muslim who heads the Arab American Association of New York and is one of four   of the national march. \u201cSometimes you are going to upset people. \u201d The post that offended Ms. Willis was part of that effort. So was the quotation posted on the march\u2019s Facebook page from Bell Hooks, the black feminist, about forging a stronger sisterhood by \u201cconfronting the ways women  \u2014   through sex, class and race  \u2014   dominated and exploited other women. \u201d In response, a New Jersey woman wrote: \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel not very welcome in this endeavor. \u201d A debate then ensued about whether white women were just now experiencing what minority women experience daily, or were having a hard time yielding control. A young white woman from Baltimore wrote with bitterness that white women who might have been victims of rape and abuse were being \u201casked to check their privilege,\u201d a catchphrase that refers to people acknowledging their advantages, but which even some liberal women find unduly confrontational. No one involved with the march fears that the rancor will dampen turnout even many of those who expressed dismay at the tone of the discussion said they still intended to join what is sure to be the largest demonstration yet against the Trump presidency. \u201cI will march,\u201d one wrote on the march\u2019s Facebook page, \u201cHoping that someday soon a sense of unity will occur before it\u2019s too late. \u201d But these debates over race also reflect deeper questions about the future of progressivism in the age of Trump. Should the march highlight what divides women, or what unites them? Is there room for women who have never heard of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d? And at a time when a presidential candidate ran against political correctness and won  \u2014   with half of white female voters supporting him  \u2014   is this the time to tone down talk about race or to double down? \u201cIf your   goal is to get as many people as possible at the march, maybe you don\u2019t want to alienate people,\u201d said Anne Valk, the author of \u201cRadical Sisters,\u201d a book about racial and class differences in the women\u2019s movement. \u201cBut if your   goal is to use the march as a catalyst for progressive social and political change, then that has to include thinking about race and class privilege. \u201d The discord also reflects the variety of women\u2019s rights and liberal causes being represented at the march, as well as a generational divide. Many older white women spent their lives fighting for rights like workplace protections that younger women now take for granted. Many young activists have spent years protesting police tactics and criminal justice policies  \u2014   issues they feel too many white liberals have ignored. \u201cYes, equal pay is an issue,\u201d Ms. Sarsour said. \u201cBut look at the ratio of what white women get paid versus black women and Latina women. \u201d For too long, the march organizers said, the women\u2019s rights movement focused on issues that were important to   white women, such as the ability to work outside the home and attain the same   positions that men do. But minority women, they said, have had different priorities. Black women who have worked their whole lives as maids might care more about the minimum wage or police brutality than about seeing a woman in the White House. Undocumented immigrant women might care about abortion rights, they said, but not nearly as much as they worry about being deported. This brand of feminism  \u2014   frequently referred to as \u201cintersectionality\u201d  \u2014   asks white women to acknowledge that they have had it easier. It speaks candidly about the history of racism, even within the feminist movement itself. The organizers of the 1913 suffrage march on Washington asked black women to march at the back of the parade. The issue of race has followed the march from its inception. The day after the election, Bob Bland, a fashion designer in New York, floated the idea of a march in Washington on Facebook. Within hours, 3, 000 people said they would join. Then a friend called to tell Ms. Bland that a woman in Hawaii with a similar page had collected pledges from 12, 000 people. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, let\u2019s merge,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bland recalled. As the effort grew, a number of comments on Facebook implored Ms. Bland, who is white, to include minority women on the leadership team. Ms. Bland felt strongly that it was the right thing to do. Within three days of the election, Carmen Perez, a Hispanic activist working on juvenile justice, and Tamika D. Mallory, a gun control activist who is black, joined Ms. Bland. Gloria Steinem, honorary   of the march along with Harry Belafonte, lauded their approach. \u201cSexism is always made worse by racism  \u2014   and vice versa,\u201d she said in an email. Ms. Steinem, who plans to participate in a town hall meeting during the march with Alicia Garza, a   of Black Lives Matter, said even contentious conversations about race were a \u201cgood thing. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about knowing each other,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhich is what movements and marches are for. \u201d But the tone of the discussion, particularly online, can become so raw that some   marchers feel they are no longer welcome. Ms. Willis, the South Carolina wedding minister, had been looking forward to the salve of rallying with people who share her values, a rarity in her home state, where she said she had been insulted and shouted at for marrying gay couples. But then she read a post by ShiShi Rose, a    blogger from Brooklyn. \u201cNow is the time for you to be listening more, talking less,\u201d Ms. Rose wrote. \u201cYou should be reading our books and understanding the roots of racism and white supremacy. Listening to our speeches. You should be drowning yourselves in our poetry. \u201d It rubbed Ms. Willis the wrong way. \u201cHow do you know that I\u2019m not reading black poetry?\u201d she asked in an interview. Ms. Willis says that she understands being born white gives her advantages, and that she is always open to learning more about the struggles of others. But, she said, \u201cThe last thing that is going to make me endeared to you, to know you and love you more, is if you are sitting there wagging your finger at me. \u201d Ms. Rose said in an interview that the intention of the post was not to weed people out but rather to make them understand that they had a lot of learning to do. \u201cI needed them to understand that they don\u2019t just get to join the march and not check their privilege constantly,\u201d she said. That phrase  \u2014   check your privilege  \u2014   exasperates Ms. Willis. She asked a reporter: \u201cCan you please tell me what that means?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562303.3225198}
