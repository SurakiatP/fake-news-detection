S. Supreme Court for a decisive ruling.  Trump tweeted: People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017, The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S. C.  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017, The basis of the legal challenges to Trump\u2019s executive orders is the argument that his executive order is really an effort to exclude Muslims from the U. S. on religious grounds, and is therefore a violation of the First Amendment. But Trump\u2019s tweets said nothing about religion. In fact, they arguably strengthen his argument that the executive orders are not motivated by religious bias, because they refer specifically to a \u201ctravel ban\u201d and not a \u201cMuslim ban. \u201d The government has argued that the travel restrictions would apply equally to people of all faiths from the countries subject to the temporary suspension. Only the word \u201cban\u201d is common to both phrases. While that word suggests the president might have intended more permanent restrictions, nothing in the wording of his orders provides for that. In a Washington Post article titled \u201cTrump\u2019s latest tweets will likely hurt effort to restore travel ban,\u201d correspondent Matt Zapotosky notes that the tweets \u201cmade clear  \u2014   despite his own press secretary\u2019s past remarks to the contrary  \u2014   that the executive order is a \u2018ban,\u2019 not a pause on some sources of immigration or an enhanced vetting system. \u201d But the press secretary\u2019s comments are irrelevant to the case, and so is the difference between a \u201cpause\u201d and a \u201cban. \u201d Zapotosky provided no further explanation as to how \u201ctravel ban\u201d conveyed religious bias against Muslims. Zapotosky argues that Trump\u2019s new endorsement of the first version of the \u201ctravel ban\u201d also helps build a case that it was motivated by religious bias  \u2014   but again, he fails to explain how. A federal court in Boston actually upheld that first version of the order on the grounds that the president had sweeping authority to designate classes of aliens that could be excluded from the country, and that the courts did not have authority to dictate national security policy. What appears to have happened is classic confirmation bias. Journalists and political critics of the president seem to have read \u201cMuslim ban\u201d into the phrase \u201ctravel ban,\u201d confusing wishful thinking on their part for legal analysis.
