Islam is not gay-friendly. It\u2019s the leftist idiot who would believe that it is despite a mountain of evidence showing the truth about Islam. \\nHowever \u2013 too many follow the company line. It is getting very demanding these days, and frankly very strange. But doesn\u2019t the left always do that? Whatever problem there is within the right \u2013 at least there is enough room, and more than the case now with the left. Well \u2013 at least for this \u2018cis\u2019 white male.

They\u2019re just afraid of the ridicule they will get by talking about it in within their liberal circles. Manual Paleologos October 27, 2016 @ 10:56 am \\nThe irony is that the LGBTQWERTY community is almost uniformly liberal. They support the people who are stoning them, throwing them from buildings, and hanging them. They have ceded any influence with the political Right, as no matter what the Right does, they will not get any meaningful Gay support. That means that just or unjust, there is absolutely no upside to supporting Gay issues. There is a small upside from the Christian Right, to pissing on them. \\nMeanwhile, although we disagree on some major issues, we are probably their best friends. We are the people who would die to protect them.'"}, "time": 1742628526.9755292}
