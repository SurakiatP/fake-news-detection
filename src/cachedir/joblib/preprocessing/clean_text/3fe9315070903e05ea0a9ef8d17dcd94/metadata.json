Trump chose Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be his health and human services secretary, the American Medical Association swiftly endorsed the selection of one of its own, an orthopedic surgeon who has championed the role of physicians throughout his legislative career. Then the larger world of doctors and nurses weighed in on the beliefs and record of Mr. Price, a suburban Atlanta Republican  \u2014   and the split among caregivers, especially doctors, quickly grew sharp. \u201cThe A. M. A. does not speak for us,\u201d says a petition signed by more than 5, 000 doctors. Mr. Trump and a   Congress are considering some of the biggest changes to the American health care system in generations: not only the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which is providing insurance to some 20 million people, but also the transformation of Medicare, for older Americans, and Medicaid, for   people. Mr. Price has favored those changes. Seven years ago, the A. M. A. \u2019s support helped lift President Obama\u2019s health care proposals toward passage, and the group has backed the law, with some reservations, since its adoption in 2010. But as Republicans push for its dismantlement, deep disagreements within the A. M. A. which has long wielded tremendous power in Washington, could lessen its influence. The concerns voiced by dissident doctors do not appear to imperil Senate confirmation of Mr. Price, but they do ensure that his confirmation hearings next month will be as contentious as any held for a Trump nominee, featuring a full public examination of the new president\u2019s proposed health policies. \u201cDoctors are divided big time,\u201d said Dr. Carl G. Streed Jr. a primary care doctor at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a member of the A. M. A. house of delegates, the organization\u2019s principal   body. The controversy began soon after Mr. Trump announced on Nov. 29 that he had chosen Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which controls Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal health insurance exchange, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Within hours, the A. M. A.  \u2014   the nation\u2019s largest medical advocacy group, which has nearly 235, 000 members and calls itself \u201cthe voice of the medical profession\u201d  \u2014   issued a statement saying it \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the selection. It noted Mr. Price\u2019s experience as a doctor, a state legislator and a member of Congress. It praised, in particular, his support for \u201cpatient choice and   solutions\u201d and his efforts to reduce \u201cexcessive regulatory burdens\u201d on doctors. The enthusiasm was understandable at one level: Mr. Price has been a member of the A. M. A. house of delegates since 2005 and was an alternate delegate for a decade before that, according to the A. M. A. and the Medical Association of Georgia. \u201cFor those who are attacking Dr. Price, I have to ask whom you would rather have at the helm of H. H. S.  \u2014   a career bureaucrat? A former governor who views doctors as a cost center to be controlled?\u201d said Dr. Robert E. Hertzka of San Diego, an anesthesiologist and former president of the California Medical Association. \u201cTom Price may turn out to be the best friend that physicians and patients have ever had in that role. \u201d Many doctors are not willing to take that chance. More than 750 people who identify themselves as members of the A. M. A. signed a letter to the association\u2019s board objecting to the endorsement. The \u201cunqualified support\u201d for Mr. Price is inappropriate, the letter says, because he has been \u201ca strong opponent of so much of our clearly delineated A. M. A. policy\u201d on issues like the Affordable Care Act, contraception and gay rights. Some doctors also said patients could be hurt by major changes in Medicare and Medicaid that Mr. Price, along with other House Republicans, has advocated. Dr. Andrea S. Christopher, 32, an internal medicine doctor at the veterans hospital in Boise, Idaho, said she had decided not to renew her A. M. A. membership over the endorsement, which she called especially upsetting to her generation of physicians. \u201cDr. Price has been an outspoken opponent of the Affordable Care Act, which has done so much to address the needs of our most vulnerable patients and reduced the uninsured rate to the lowest level on record,\u201d Dr. Christopher said. Dr. Kristin M. Huntoon, a    neurosurgery resident at Ohio State University in Columbus, said the group\u2019s support for Mr. Price had increased the chances that the Affordable Care Act would be dismantled  \u2014   and that has put her patients at risk. Ohio has extended Medicaid coverage to more than 600, 000 people under the federal health care law. If that expansion is reversed, Dr. Huntoon said, some patients will not receive imaging or treatment at an early stage of their disease, and they are more likely to arrive when tumors have spread to the brain. \u201cAt that stage,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s often nothing I can do for the patient. \u201d Physicians have long been a focus of Mr. Price\u2019s legislative efforts. He led the push to fix widely recognized flaws in Medicare\u2019s formula for paying doctors and supported changes in malpractice laws that could make it easier for doctors to defend themselves. He supported changes in Medicare that would allow doctors to get around fee limits by signing contracts with patients. He has also backed changes in antitrust law that would enhance doctors\u2019 bargaining power in negotiations with insurance companies. \u201cPocketbook issues  \u2014   the economic   of physicians  \u2014   may well be a factor contributing to the A. M. A. \u2019s endorsement,\u201d said Dr. Manan Trivedi, a former Democratic candidate for Congress, who is the president of the National Physicians Alliance, a group of 10, 000 doctors that opposes Mr. Price\u2019s confirmation. Dr. Patrice A. Harris, the chairwoman of the A. M. A. strongly defended the group\u2019s actions and suggested that Mr. Price could surprise critics as Dr. C. Everett Koop did in the 1980s, when he was surgeon general under President Ronald Reagan. Liberal politicians and women\u2019s groups initially criticized Dr. Koop because of his opposition to abortion, but when he stepped down after more than seven years in office, he was widely praised for his role in fighting AIDS and discouraging the use of tobacco. \u201cWe do realize that there is a diversity of opinion on Dr. Price,\u201d Dr. Harris said in an interview. \u201cWe respect that diversity. We take the concerns that have been expressed by some of our members and by physicians in general seriously. \u201cOur support for Dr. Price is based on our history with him, his extensive involvement with A. M. A. ,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s a longtime member, he\u2019s a delegate. For us, he has always been accessible. He listens, and he really knows how policies impact the delivery of care and the   relationship. \u201d Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said Mr. Price had been endorsed by many medical groups and was \u201cuniquely prepared\u201d for the job. \u201cIf confirmed,\u201d he said, \u201cDr. Price will work to restore the   relationship and clamp down on government overreach. \u201d Mr. Price has introduced legislation to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s health law, including its expansion of Medicaid and subsidies for the purchase of private insurance. He advocates tax credits to help people buy insurance, greater use of individual health savings accounts and   \u201c  pools\u201d for people with   conditions who might otherwise have difficulty finding affordable coverage. As a member of the House Budget Committee, and then its chairman, he has supported proposals to shift Medicare away from its   commitment to pay for medical services and toward a fixed government contribution for each beneficiary, which could be used for either private insurance or traditional Medicare. Such proposals could increase costs for some beneficiaries or limit the amount of care they receive, health policy experts say. Mr. Price has also backed turning Medicaid into block grants to state governments. Critics say that states would probably respond by restricting eligibility, cutting Medicaid benefits or reducing payments to health care providers. In leading efforts to repeal the president\u2019s health law, he is pursuing a goal in opposition to the policies of the A. M. A. In a 2010 letter to congressional leaders, Dr. J. James Rohack, who was then president of the A. M. A. said the law took \u201can important step toward improving the health of the American people,\u201d by \u201cextending coverage to the vast majority of the uninsured\u201d and \u201cimproving competition and choice in the insurance marketplace. \u201d Dr. Samantha G. Harrington, a doctor at Cambridge Hospital in Massachusetts, said she had canceled her A. M. A. membership because she found its endorsement of Mr. Price \u201cembarrassing and shameful. \u201d Dr. Thomas M. Gellhaus, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said Mr. Price had \u201cworked closely with us\u201d on many issues. But, he said in a recent letter to the congressman, \u201csome of the bills you supported in Congress would not serve women\u2019s health well. \u201d Mr. Price has supported efforts to restrict abortion and cut off federal funds for Planned Parenthood clinics. If confirmed, Mr. Price would be only the third physician to serve as secretary in the   history of the Health and Human Services Department and its predecessor, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.'"}, "time": 1742561822.9102426}
