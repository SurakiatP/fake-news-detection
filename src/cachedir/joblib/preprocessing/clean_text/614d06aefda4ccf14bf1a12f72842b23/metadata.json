Trump would face a virtual shutout on Tuesday. Of dozens of dailies in the state, only The Santa Barbara   has backed the Republican presidential nominee, Politico reported. But how do the publications line up on the rest of Tuesday\u2019s ballot? Research has shown that even in the digital age, endorsements by newspaper editorial boards still sway some minds. Their influence is greatest when the choice is unexpected, such as when The San Diego   came out in favor of Hillary Clinton, the first Democrat to be backed for president in the paper\u2019s   history. In such cases, roughly 5 percent of readers can be persuaded to switch their votes, said Brian G. Knight, a professor of economics at Brown University, who has studied newspaper endorsements. The effect is also likely amplified on questions further down the ballot, Dr. Knight said. For Californians overwhelmed by 17 statewide initiatives, along with choices on everything from school board candidates to complicated stadium plans, guidance from a newspaper can go a long way. We took a look at how six of the state\u2019s leading newspapers by number of subscribers  \u2014   The San Diego   The Orange County Register, The Los Angeles Times, The Mercury News, San Francisco Chronicle and The Sacramento Bee  \u2014   lined up on some propositions. \u2022 Proposition 56 (increases tobacco tax) Yes: 5 (  Times, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) No: 1 (Register) \u2022 Proposition 58 (restores bilingual education) Yes: 4 (Times, Register, Chronicle, Bee) No: 2 (  Mercury) \u2022 Proposition 61 (changes drug pricing) Yes: 0 No: 6 (  Times, Register, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) \u2022 Proposition 62 (abolishes death penalty) Yes: 6 (  Times, Register, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) No: 0 \u2022 Proposition 63 (tightens gun control) Yes: 5 (  Times, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) No: 1 (Register) \u2022 Proposition 64 (legalizes recreational marijuana) Yes: 5 (  Times, Register, Mercury, Chronicle) No: 1 (Bee) \u2022 Proposition 67 (bans plastic bags) Yes: 5 (  Times, Mercury, Chronicle, Bee) No: 1 (Register) Tuesday is Election Day.

In 1991, when Magic Johnson stunned America with the news that he had H. I. V. many figured he had little time left. \u201cAll of us thought it was a death sentence,\u201d Pat Riley, the former Lakers coach, told The Times\u2019s Harvey Araton years later. But in 2016, Johnson is, of course, very much alive. It was 25 years ago today that Johnson, then 32, told reporters at the Forum that he would leave the Lakers because of the diagnosis and dedicate himself to raising awareness about H. I. V. prevention. \u201cI think sometimes we think, well, only gay people can get it  \u2014   \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen to me,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here I am saying that it can happen to anybody, even me, Magic Johnson. \u201d Johnson mounted a pair of comebacks in the 1990s, but faced resistance from some players, notably Karl Malone, who expressed fears about playing with him. Johnson settled into a new life as a philanthropist, businessman and, in recent years, part owner of the Dodgers. His Magic Johnson Foundation funds prevention of H. I. V.  and other charitable goals. Johnson has said he has to remind people that he is not cured, but managing the infection with a cocktail of drugs. More than 1. 2 million people in the United States live with H. I. V. according to government data. During the 1991 news conference, Johnson told reporters, flashing his trademark smile, \u201cI plan on going on living for a long time, bugging you guys like I always have. \u201d This year, Johnson turned 57.
