Ms. Schumer was a gleefully raunchy comic who found a pointed feminist voice on her Comedy Central sketch show \u201cInside Amy Schumer. \u201d But in her new global tour, which comes to Madison Square Garden next month, she has slyly found an arena   language to match her evolving reputation. Ms. Schumer smuggles social commentary about gender into broad   bits. At one point on Friday, she lay down onstage, took off her high heels and invited a guy in the audience to try them on. After she flirted with him onstage, he stepped into the shoes and teetered awkwardly. Then she ordered him to walk around like she had, which he tried to do, uneasily. A man stumbling in woman\u2019s shoes is an easy joke, but this bit of crowd work evoked the old line about Ginger Rogers doing everything Fred Astaire did, except backward and in heels. It got a huge response, but around me, the women laughed louder. The most significant shift in her   is one of perspective. Her early work used the voice of a blinkered, entitled party girl who often said dumb and offensive things, many of which were   false. And yet there were moments when a different voice interrupted for a punch line that broke the fourth wall, like the  : \u201cMy best friend is black   \u2026     in this story. \u201d The early criticism of Ms. Schumer\u2019s work came from comedy snobs who dismissed her jokes as character comedy, shorthand for material rooted in a fake persona, an approach deemed by some to be inferior to   in your own personal voice. This distinction between character and personal comedy is rooted in na\u00efve notions about the authenticity of certain kinds of   a belief as simplistic as the one that indie   are more real than pop stars. But there is some truth (and usefulness) in these aesthetic categories, particularly when it comes to describing Ms. Schumer\u2019s evolution. In her new   when Ms. Schumer says something happened to her, she wants you to believe it. She also doesn\u2019t play dumb. She speaks in a confident, savvy voice that doesn\u2019t sound that different than the one you might read in interviews with her. This dovetails with the politics of her comedy, which offers a sustained critique of how the media and culture make women feel insecure and apologetic. You might say Ms. Schumer has merely changed rude personas, replacing the ditsy girl with that of the arrogant celebrity. If so, she\u2019s still keeping a firm eye on her audience\u2019s sympathies. Her harshest gibes are for famous people (Gwyneth Paltrow, the Kardashians) who market fantasies of perfection masked as something more down to earth. Ms. Schumer positions herself as a star so relatable she\u2019s not going to try to trick you into thinking she\u2019s relatable. While she delivered some topical jokes (a funny   about gun laws, a scene about meeting Hillary Clinton, for whom she appeared at a   before the show) the content of her material  \u2014   much of it new, some repurposed  \u2014   could still be described by the title of her first special: \u201cMostly Sex Stuff. \u201d She still favors a jaunty    style of joke that depends on pinpoint pauses. \u201cI\u2019m going to make him wait,\u201d she says about sex on a first date, waiting a beat. \u201cAll through dinner. \u201d Pivot, deepening voice: \u201cWe didn\u2019t go to dinner. \u201d Most of her laughs, however, are earned not from concise jokes but detailed stories, punched up by an animated performance style. Ms. Schumer has long cut sour material with a sweet glance, but now she uses a more theatrical vocabulary for such incongruities. When she describes telling her boyfriend that she is finished performing oral sex, she employs the cheery voice of a game show host. And when she gets really dirty, Ms. Schumer pairs jokes with pantomimes of tap dancing or a tip of a cap accompanied by a  . Ms. Schumer, who made the leap to movies last year with \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d makes a point of saying   is her favorite thing, but her comedy, like that of Louis C. K. increasingly leans on acting chops. She moves from prim scold to maniac princess to   aggression with alacrity  \u2014   and without ever seeming as if she\u2019s working too hard. She makes hustle look effortless. Yet after a breakthrough 2015, Ms. Schumer\u2019s stardom has shifted into a slightly precarious position. She remains at the center of pop culture  \u2014   her book, \u201cThe Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo,\u201d is on the   lists  \u2014   but often for reasons peripheral to her work. She\u2019s become a fixture on the online controversy circuit, garnering headlines not for the last season of her sketch show, but for accusations that she stole jokes (which she denies) and for criticism of comments about rape from one of her TV show\u2019s writers. Such   are part of being a famous and provocative comic today. And she has proved herself canny at negotiating the digital world, creating her own viral moments by releasing a clip of her handling a heckler or posting a photo on Instagram skewering double standards in publishing. Still, Ms. Schumer repeatedly called herself an awful famous person onstage here. \u201cI say what I mean,\u201d she said, \u201cso I probably won\u2019t be able to do this much longer. \u201d It\u2019s unclear exactly what she meant, but it\u2019s the kind of intriguing aside that makes you sit forward in your chair. In comedy, meaning what you say doesn\u2019t beat saying it in a meaningful way.'"}, "time": 1742562651.3613842}
