Maybe it\u2019s that, despite government claims to the contrary, it has been established that there\u2019s no way to vet the Mideast migrants entering our nation. Or it could just be good old-fashioned common sense. Whatever the case, a Michigan town has sent the federal government a clear message: We have no interest in participating in your so-called \u201cRefugee Resettlement Program.\u201d As Breitbart reports : Waterford Township trustees in Oakland County, Michigan, passed a resolution on Monday telling the federal government not to resettle any refugees, including those from Syria, within the township\u2019s boundaries, until the program \u201chas been significantly reformed.\u201d The resolution stated : \u201cThe Charter Township of Waterford will not actively participate in the Refugee Resettlement Program until the Program has been significantly reformed, and until it has been demonstrated that the Townships of Oakland County have the capacity to absorb refugees without diverting funds from needy residents or exposing their residents to unwarranted security risks.\u201d \\nWaterford Township isn\u2019t the first entity to cry foul over the feds\u2019 migrant-resettlement social engineering scheme. In late September, Texas formerly withdrew from the government program, although the feds have not given up on trying to flood the state with migrants (informative video on this subject below). And Breitbart tells us of \u201cOakland County, Michigan, where County Executive L. Brooks Patterson has said he intends to sue the federal government for resettling refugees in the county while failing to comply with the \u2018consultation clause\u2019 of the Refugee Act of 1980 that requires the federal government and the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to consult with state and local government officials prior to the placement of refugees within their jurisdictions.\u201d \\nThese state and local governments are right to be concerned about the Mideast migrants \u2014 especially since the feds have been less than honest. While the latter often claim the newcomers are thoroughly vetted, this is simply an impossibility. First, countries such as Syria don\u2019t have comprehensive Western-style databases containing reliable information on the citizenry. Even more significantly, you can bribe public officials in Syria (and most Third World and Muslim countries) and get official government documents stating you\u2019re whoever you want to be . This is why sources as varied as U.S. intelligence officials, the Greek government, and a NYC Syrian community leader have all warned that the Mideast migrants are unknown quantities . \\nIt is also clear that the current effort to place Muslim migrants in the West is a con. On this point I often quote Dr. Mudar Zahran, a Muslim refugee and Jordanian resistance leader living in Britain. While calling himself a \u201cpracticing Muslim,\u201d he also has a warning for the West : \\nKeep the Muslim migrants out of the West. \\nHis reasoning? As Zahran pointed out in a 2015 interview, \u201cSeventy-five percent of those arriving from Syria come from safe area[s]; actually, the ones in disaster areas cannot ... leave.\u201d He pointed out that most of them arrive from safe places such as Turkey or Jordan and bypass poor European countries, instead settling in nations such as Sweden or Germany, \u201cwhere there is a rich nation with a generous welfare system.\u201d \\nJust as significantly, as of the publication date of this Daily Mail report, the five richest Arab nations \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar \u2014 had refused to accept even one single Syrian migrant, despite these countries being far closer to the migrants\u2019 native lands. These nations, despite sharing faith and ethnicity with the migrants, seem to believe they \u201cwon\u2019t fit in.\u201d Yet if this is so, why should anyone think they\u2019d fit in (assimilate) in the West? \\nZahran spoke of this as well, saying that \u201cin most cases they [Muslims] don\u2019t seem to fully integrate\u201d and, furthermore, warning of \u201cpeople who want to turn Europe into a Muslim state.\u201d And the writing may already be on the wall, as the makers of the below video on Dearborn, Michigan \u2014 called \u201cDearbornistan\u201d by many \u2014 contend. \\nYet Dr. Zahran claims there\u2019s something more insidious at work here than just unwillingness to assimilate and Arab nations\u2019 indifference to coreligionist plight. As he put it, \u201cYou read Arab magazines and Arab newspapers; they are talking about, \u2018Good job! Now we\u2019re going to conquest [sic] Europe.\u2019 So it\u2019s not even a secret.\u201d \\nZahran might be referring to the hijra , which in Arabic means \u201cmigration\u201d or \u201cjourney\u201d; this is a type of jihad conducted not via a hot war but a cold demographic war whose goal is the subsumption of a target people. This aim is sometimes stated, as by the Muslim migrant here , who said that his goal in going to the West was to \u201cIslamize\u201d Europeans. Zahran calls this \u201cthe soft Islamic conquest of the West.\u201d \\nYet even Muslim migrants who don\u2019t arrive as stealth- hijra jihadists (and logic dictates that most don\u2019t), can still pose a problem. Germany is said to be \u201closing control of the streets\u201d and Sweden is much the same , after absorbing large numbers of Mideast migrants. Migrants in Germany committed 142,500 crimes during the first six months of 2016 \u2014 amounting to 780 crimes a day (and note: political correctness prevents many such crimes from being reported; the number is no doubt higher). In Sweden, police are so overwhelmed and demoralized that three officers a day quit their jobs, a significant number in a small nation. Moreover, more than 50 Swedish areas are now considered \u201cno-go zones,\u201d places where authorities fear to tread and civil law has broken down. \\nThis migrant lawlessness isn\u2019t hard to understand. British philosopher Edmund Burke noted, \u201cSociety cannot exist, unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without.\u201d In Muslim lands, a great proportion is \u201cwithout,\u201d with Draconian punishment being the norm; the chopping off of hands and heads and the blinding of people are not uncommon. Yet a prerequisite for the Western norm of relatively light punishment is that a greater proportion of that controlling power will be within. And when the Mideast migrants enter the West, it\u2019s often a \u201cWhen the cat\u2019s away, the mice will play\u201d situation. Add to this Koranic verses labeling non-Muslims fair game for plunder, rape, and deceit, and it\u2019s a toxic mix. \\nDespite this, the Obama administration forges on ahead with so-called \u201crefugee resettlement,\u201d having accepted 13,210 \u201cSyrian\u201d migrants thus far this year, a 675 percent increase over 2015. Note that Hillary Clinton has vowed to continue in this vein. And migrants of all kinds are now flooding into the United States , owing to our porous borders and Obama\u2019s refusal to enforce immigration law. The result? Our immigrant population is now at an all-time high . \\nAnd further note: Clinton has been caught admitting that she believes in \u201copen borders.\u201d \\nThe question is, does the West have a collective mind so open that its brain has fallen out? If over time we accept one million Muslim migrants and just one-tenth of one percent are terrorists or become so, that\u2019s 1,000 violent jihadists. Moreover, the current push to accept these migrants has nothing to do with compassion, but with importing socialist-leaning voters who can create an unassailable leftist voting bloc. Know that 85 percent of our new immigrants (and almost all illegal migrants) hail from the Third World and Mideast, and 70 to 90 percent of them vote Democrat upon being naturalized. It\u2019s a left-wing \u201chijra.\u201d \\nSo, yes, when the Left proclaims \u201cOur strength lies in our diversity,\u201d they literally mean their strength.
