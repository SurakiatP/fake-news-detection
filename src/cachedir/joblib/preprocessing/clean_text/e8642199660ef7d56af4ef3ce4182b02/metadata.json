As the nation delivered Donald J. Trump a stunning victory, California went the other direction, embracing a progressive agenda. The state resoundingly backed Hillary Clinton, delivering her its 55 electoral votes, but it wasn\u2019t enough to stem the wave of battleground states that lined up for Mr. Trump. \u201cProbably no state is going to be more shocked by tomorrow morning\u2019s headlines than California,\u201d Bruce E. Cain, a professor of political science at Stanford University, said late Tuesday. Still, he noted, large parts of California did support Mr. Trump  \u2014   mostly rural areas in the Central Valley and northern counties. Mindy Romero, the director of the California Civic Engagement Project at the University of California, Davis, said some state leaders err in seeing California as wholly blue. \u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d she said, \u201cand people do feel left out or marginalized. \u201d She added, \u201cThere will be areas of the state that are very glad to see Donald Trump win and I think we should recognize that. \u201d When California makes choices as a whole, however, as it did on 17 ballot propositions, the results tend to reflect the more populous liberal side. On Tuesday, voters did away with prohibitions against marijuana, raised taxes on cigarettes, extended an income tax on the wealthy, toughened gun control laws, loosened parole rules and overturned a law that restricted bilingual education in schools. Californians also sent the first black woman to the United States Senate since Carol Moseley Braun in 1999. Attorney General Kamala Harris easily defeated Representative Loretta Sanchez in the state\u2019s first   race, the result of the   primary system. \u201cI intend to fight for a state that has the largest number of immigrants, documented and undocumented,\u201d Ms. Harris told a crowd of supporters. \u201cOur ideals are at stake right now  \u2014   and we need to fight for our ideals. \u201d California will join four other states and the District of Columbia where recreational marijuana is allowed, and the decision could open the door to federal legalization. The passage of the measure will allow residents older than 21 to grow up to six cannabis plants at home and an ounce of marijuana. It also allows the state, county and city government to regulate and tax the growth and sale of marijuana. Voters also passed a measure supported by Gov. Jerry Brown that would increase the number of nonviolent inmates eligible for parole and allow the inmates to earn credit for good behavior. The measure was aimed at reducing the state\u2019s prison population and rolling back some of the    measures Governor Brown once championed. Showing just how much the state\u2019s attitude toward immigrants has changed over the last two decades, voters approved Proposition 58, repealing a measure that passed in 1998 and expanding bilingual education for the state\u2019s 1. 4 million English language learners. Buyers of gun ammunition will now have to undergo criminal background checks, and   magazines are illegal, after the passage of Proposition 63, a   measure brought by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. The measure will also create new requirements for lost or stolen firearms and ammunition. Voters approved a $2 tax increase per pack of cigarettes, an initiative that prevailed despite more than $70 million spent by tobacco companies to defeat it.   earners  \u2014   individuals earning more than $250, 000 a year  \u2014   will continue to pay more in taxes, as voters approved a measure that extends the tax increase passed in 2012 by an additional 12 years, till 2030. The revenue will primarily be used to fund public schools. Initiatives that would abolish the death penalty and impose price controls on pharmaceutical drugs were both behind in early vote counts. A plastic bag ban was ahead. In closely contested House races, Republican incumbents appeared to be holding on. In the Central Valley, the Republican David Valadao kept his seat, which was thought to be so endangered that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan came to the district to campaign for him. The Republicans Darrell Issa, Steve Knight and Jeff Denham were all leading in early vote counts. Dr. Cain, the Stanford professor, suggested that after the shock felt by many Californians over Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendance subsides, the state would enter familiar territory. \u201cCalifornia will be in mourning tomorrow,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cWe will go back into the mode that we were in during the Bush administration, which is we were the kind of the rebel state. \u201d Want to make sure your vote was counted?

[The New York Times] With the election behind us, how about a palate cleanser? Research has shown that the company of animals can do wonders for people in ill health. With that in mind, the San Diego Zoo has been partnering with children\u2019s hospitals across the country to show programming of its animals on televisions in patients\u2019 rooms. The television channel, known as San Diego Zoo Kids, features footage from the zoo\u2019s live cameras as well as hosts who tell stories about the animals. Since the initiative\u2019s debut in 2013 at Rady Children\u2019s Hospital in San Diego, it has spread to nearly 80 children\u2019s hospitals and Ronald McDonald Houses, a charity for sick children, across 26 states and three countries. On Tuesday, the zoo announced its latest partnership with a children\u2019s hospital in Phoenix. Erin Rice, the director of U. C. L. A\u2019s   Connection program, said scientists have found evidence that animal therapy can help lower blood pressure and raise oxytocin levels in patients. The San Diego Zoo program was a \u201cwonderful idea,\u201d she said. \u201cJust bringing the outdoors into a very sterile environment is helpful. \u201d California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
