He\u2019s already gotten to work appointing his new Cabinet members and laying the groundwork for his new administration. And if it wasn\u2019t already clear that things are going to be done Trump\u2019s way for the next four years, Donald Trump just whispered \u201cHope you like to make ham, motherfucker\u201d to a White House executive chef. \\nWow! It looks like Washington is going to be a very different place under President Trump! \\nThose who witnessed the encounter say that, during a recent visit to the White House, Trump caught sight of a high-ranking member of the White House kitchen, waved him over, and said, \u201cCome here, let me talk to you a minute,\u201d in a voice that was somehow both cordial and threatening. When the chef got close to Trump, the president-elect shook his hand, pulled him close, and began whispering that once he got sworn in, the chef would be doing nothing but cooking him ham 24/7. \\nMembers of the White House staff overheard the phrases \u201cHam is your life now, idiot\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t care what else you can cook. I only want ham\u201d as Trump whispered to the chef, whose eyes grew wide with silent fear as he listened to what our nation\u2019s newest president was telling him. They also say that Trump briefly smiled to wave to photographers before turning back to the chef with a dark and menacing expression on his face to continue whispering about ham. \\nNow that\u2019s the sign of a president who isn\u2019t afraid to shake things up! \\nWhile many Americans are deeply troubled by the bigoted rhetoric of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, those who voted for him as a protest against the political establishment have got to be pretty happy about a story like this one! No other president would grab a White House chef by the hand and whisper, \u201cYou live in Ham World now, motherfucker!\u201d \\nAnd it seems as if President-elect Trump has a concrete plan in place, as well! Trump didn\u2019t just tell the White House chef that he wanted ham in general; he had specific types of ham that he wanted, including \u201cbaked ham,\u201d \u201csmoked ham all the time,\u201d and \u201cham with frosting.\u201d Trump was also overheard telling the White House chef, \u201cYou\u2019re also going to be making something called a Pork Jackhammer, which I just invented during the limo ride over here. It\u2019s incredibly dangerous to make, and I want to eat it every day.\u201d \\nIt definitely looks like this is going to be a new era in Washington! You just know it\u2019s not going to be business as usual in D.C. anymore when Donald Trump isn\u2019t afraid to look a White House chef right in the eye and say, \u201cWhen I ask for Chinese food, that just means soy sauce on ham. When I ask for sushi, that\u2019s raw ham. President Trump will be eating barges of ham for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The moment I take the oath of office is the moment that your world becomes a pork-fueled hellscape.\u201d \\nPeople who voted for Trump wanted a maverick, and it looks like they got one! \\nAfter about two minutes of whispering ham-related threats, Trump stepped away from the chef and began smiling and waving at the surrounding press as if nothing had happened, but his message was clear: When Donald Trump becomes president, he\u2019s going to play by his own rules, and he\u2019s only going to eat ham! If President Trump has his way, life in the White House might become completely unrecognizable!'"}, "time": 1742564264.533715}
