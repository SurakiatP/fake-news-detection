Its host was Erick Erickson, a   redheaded former election lawyer and city councilman in Macon, Ga. who began blogging in 2004 on a site called RedState. com. Erickson, who is now 41, is a conservative absolutist who made his name in the   by \u201cblowing up\u201d  \u2014   in the Twitter parlance he jovially employs  \u2014   Republican leaders he viewed as insufficiently principled. In 2005, he played a role in torpedoing the Supreme Court nomination of the White House counsel Harriet Miers, publishing damaging admissions from White House sources that Miers had not been properly vetted. Five years later, he chided the National Rifle Association for being too willing to compromise, labeling it \u201ca weak little girl of an organization. \u201d He was a   critic of John McCain and Mitt Romney during their presidential runs, characterizing the former as \u201can angry old jackass\u201d and the latter as \u201cthe Harriet Miers of 2012. \u201d Along the way, Erickson became one of the new kingmakers of the Tea   G. O. P. A   Florida legislator and Senate hopeful named Marco Rubio reached out to him in 2009 when he was at 3 percent in the polls. A former Texas solicitor general, Ted Cruz, did the same in 2011. Rick Perry announced his 2012 presidential candidacy at Erickson\u2019s gathering. By 2015, a number of the coming cycle\u2019s aspirants  \u2014   Rubio, Cruz, Perry and Bobby Jindal  \u2014   had given him their personal cellphone numbers, and he had traded emails with Jeb Bush. And two months before that August\u2019s convention in Atlanta, a New   Republican consultant named Sam Nunberg reached out to Erickson to ask if he could accommodate one more speaker: Donald Trump. Erickson watched coverage of Trump\u2019s    announcement at Trump Tower on June 16 and was not particularly impressed. On the syndicated radio show he broadcasts from Atlanta, he offered his assessment with a dismissive chuckle: \u201cI guess he\u2019s ready to be spoiler, not president. \u201d He had met Trump once before, in July 2011, when he visited the 26th floor of Trump Tower to interview the businessman and    star. Trump had spent the past few months flirting with a presidential run only to decide, as he told Erickson that day, \u201cI have a great show that\u2019s a big success, and it\u2019s hard to say, \u2018I\u2019m gonna leave two hours of   television in order to get beat up by people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d The hourlong conversation struck Erickson as pleasant but unmemorable. What did stick with him was their exchange as he was leaving Trump Tower. \u201cTrump asked me if I played golf,\u201d Erickson told me recently. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m terrible. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Then, he said, Trump asked if he would be interested in coming to Trump\u2019s   in West Palm Beach, Fla. to play. \u201cI\u2019m very flattered  \u2014   I\u2019ve never been to West Palm Beach before,\u201d Erickson recalled. \u201cSeveral times, his office reached out. So finally I asked my wife, \u2018What do you think this is about?\u2019 She said, \u2018He wants to own your soul.\u2019 So I never went. \u201d Erickson did not see much of a political future for Trump, but he imagined that he might be good for ticket sales, if nothing else, at the RedState Gathering. He informed Nunberg that Trump could have a slot on the convention\u2019s second day. The evening before he was to speak in Atlanta, Trump went on CNN and denounced the Fox News host Megyn Kelly for her sharp questioning of him during a recent debate, speculating that Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever. \u201d When Erickson saw the footage that evening, he called Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and rescinded Trump\u2019s invitation on the grounds that he would be too much of a distraction. \u201cAnd that was that,\u201d Erickson would later recall with a sheepish grin. \u201cUntil the next day, when he\u2019s blowing me up. \u201d On Twitter, Trump called Erickson \u201ca major sleaze and buffoon\u201d and said that the \u201csmall crowds\u201d at the gathering were due to his absence. Trump\u2019s supporters soon piled on. This was to be expected, but what surprised Erickson were the attacks from people he regarded as his fellow   in the conservative revolution. On Twitter, the   host and Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham mocked \u201cJebState. \u201d The author and   provocateur Ann Coulter brought up some of Erickson\u2019s own crass utterances, like his characterization of the former Supreme Court justice David Souter in 2009 as a \u201c [expletive] child molester. \u201d The next week, 30, 000 readers of Erickson\u2019s email newsletter canceled their subscriptions. Erickson dug in, writing that Trump was \u201cout of his depth\u201d and lacking in \u201ccommon decency. \u201d But he was drowned out by Trump sympathizers with even bigger audiences than his own, like The Drudge Report and the online outlet Breitbart. It was one of the first salvos in what would open up in the year that followed into a civil war within the conservative media, dividing some of the loudest voices on the right. Days earlier, Erickson had unimpeachable credentials in the conservative movement. But by crossing Trump, he was now, in the eyes of his former allies, \u201ca tool of the establishment. \u201d The conservative media has always been a playground for outsize personalities with even more outsize political ambitions. The National Review founder William F. Buckley fashioned much of the intellectual genetic code of the Reagan Revolution, while also writing fringe groups like the John Birch Society out of the conservative movement and, for good measure, running for mayor of New York against the liberal Republican John Lindsay. In 1996, the former Nixon media consultant Roger Ailes brought his   ethos to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News channel and built the network into a transformational power in Republican politics before his fall this year amid accusations of sexual harassment. But alongside the   like Buckley and Ailes, the   landscape has also produced a class of rowdy entrepreneurs who wield their influence in more personal, protean ways. The godfathers mostly came to power in the 1990s:   antagonists like Rush Limbaugh, who began broadcasting nationally in 1988 and became talk radio\u2019s hegemonic power in the Clinton years, and Matt Drudge, who started his pioneering Drudge Report online in 1996. If these figures defied the stuffy ceremony of the East Coast think tanks, opinion journals and   columnists who traditionally defined the conservative intelligentsia, they rarely challenged the ideological principles of conservatism as they had existed since the Reagan era: small government, low taxes, hawkish foreign policy and traditional social values. What they mostly did was provide the Republican Party with a set of exceptionally loud megaphones, which liberals have often envied and tried unsuccessfully to emulate. Conservative talk radio and Fox News now collectively reach an audience of as many as 50 million  \u2014   most of them elderly white Republicans with a high likelihood of turning out in election years. And this isn\u2019t even counting the   online outlets that have flourished during the Obama years, thanks to a growing   economy and a presidency, particularly in the case of the Affordable Care Act, that gave conservatives common cause. Then came Trump. In a sense, the divide that he has opened up among conservative media figures is simply a function of the heartburn his ascent has caused among Republicans more generally, pitting voter against voter, congressman against congressman, Bob Dole against the Bushes. Some conservative media outlets threw themselves behind Trump from the beginning, explaining away his more radioactive statements and his    record as a conservative. Breitbart, whose former chairman, Steve Bannon, is now Trump\u2019s chief strategist, was an ardent early supporter, breathlessly covering Trump\u2019s ascent in the polls and his smackdowns of \u201clow energy\u201d Jeb Bush and \u201clittle Marco\u201d Rubio. But as Trump expanded into more sacrosanct targets  \u2014   Fox News\u2019s Kelly, George W. Bush\u2019s performance in the war on terror and Cruz  \u2014   the dissenting chorus among conservatism\u2019s dons grew louder. The Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer warned in December that Trump \u201chas managed to steer the entire G. O. P. campaign into absurdities. \u201d His Post colleague George Will predicted that a Trump nomination would mean the loss of conservatism \u201cas a constant presence in U. S. politics. \u201d The Weekly Standard editor William Kristol floated the idea of a new \u201c    party. \u201d And on the eve of the Iowa caucus, National Review devoted an entire issue to a single topic: \u201cAgainst Trump. \u201d Since Trump clinched the nomination, the dividing lines have become starker, the individual dilemmas more agonizing. Mark Levin, an influential   host, complains that among conservative commentators, Trump\u2019s message is endlessly repeated by what he derisively refers to as \u201cthe Rockettes. \u201d But Levin, too, recently announced to his listeners that he intends to vote for Trump, if only to prevent another Clinton presidency. As he put it to me, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be throwing confetti in the air if Trump wins,\u201d adding that he viewed the candidate as \u201ca liberal with some conservative viewpoints that he\u2019s not terribly reliable at sticking to. \u201d Others  \u2014   Sean Hannity, Ingraham, the former Reagan official and \u201cThe Book of Virtues\u201d author William Bennett  \u2014   have thrown in for Trump with a brio that strikes some in the business as unseemly. \u201cLook, we\u2019re in the opinion business, but there\u2019s a distinction between that and being a Sean Hannity fanboy,\u201d the     host Charlie Sykes told me. \u201cIt\u2019s been genuinely stunning to watch how they\u2019ve become tools of his campaign and rationalizing everything he\u2019s done. \u201d \u201cFor 20 years I\u2019ve been saying how it\u2019s not true that talk radio is all about ratings and we don\u2019t believe what we say,\u201d he went on. \u201cThen you watch how the media types rolled over for him. Obviously Donald Trump is very good for ratings, and at some point it\u2019s hard not to conclude they decided the Trump train was the gravy train. I\u2019ve been thoroughly disillusioned, and I\u2019m not alone in that. It\u2019s like watching \u2018Invasion of the Body Snatchers\u2019: Oh, my God, they got another one!\u201d When Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, the part of his announcement speech that most clearly foreshadowed the campaign to come had to do with immigration. \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d he told the crowd at Trump Tower. \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. \u201d The line struck Sykes as awfully familiar when he heard it. A month before, he had run a segment with Ann Coulter, who had just published her 11th book, an   screed titled \u201c\u00a1Adios, America!\u201d Sykes was well aware of Coulter\u2019s views, but he was taken aback when she began a riff on Mexican rapists surging into the United States (a subject that takes up an entire chapter of \u201c\u00a1Adios, America! \u201d). \u201cI remember looking at my producer and going, \u2018Wow, this is rather extraordinary,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen Trump used that line, I instantly recognized it as Ann Coulter\u2019s. \u201d In fact, Corey Lewandowski had reached out to Coulter for advice in the   to Trump\u2019s announcement speech. The address Trump delivered on June 16 bore no resemblance to his prepared text, which contained a mere two sentences about immigration. Instead, he   what Coulter today calls \u201cthe Mexican rapist speech that won my heart. \u201d When Trump\u2019s remarks provoked fury, Lewandowski called Coulter for backup. Three days later, she went on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher\u201d and, amid shrieks of laughter from the audience, predicted that Trump was the Republican candidate most likely to win the presidency. One evening this past March, Trump received Coulter at    his    in Palm Beach. Though in recent years the two had developed a rapport on Twitter, she had met him face to face only once before he declared his candidacy, a lunch date at Trump Tower in 2011. Over lunch, Trump gave Coulter the impression that he had read her books. He also gave her a few items from his wife\u2019s line of costume jewelry and told Coulter, who keeps a house in Palm Beach, that she was welcome to use the pool at    anytime. The golf resort was the chief staging ground for Trump\u2019s charm offensives against the conservative media. Many of its members have visited at Trump\u2019s invitation in recent years, joining the resident Gatsby for steak and lobster on the patio, where Trump squints and appears to listen intently while his guests dispense political wisdom  \u2014   though it is never clear whether he is actually interested in it, simply flattering his guests or sizing them up. When I dined with him on the patio this spring, Trump asked me eagerly about how I liked his odds in the election. Later, on the campaign trail, I watched him solicit the same counsel from random stragglers on the rope line. Coulter, at any rate, appeared immune to the whole routine. A week earlier, Trump bragged during a Republican presidential debate in Detroit that \u201cthere\u2019s no problem\u201d with the size of his penis. On the patio, Coulter told the candidate that no one wanted to hear about his endowment. She told Lewandowski that he should buy a dozen teleprompters and put them in every room of Trump\u2019s house until he learned how to use them. Reminding Trump that she had been his earliest and most dedicated advocate, she told him: \u201cI\u2019m the only one losing money trying to put you in the White House. You\u2019re going to listen to me. \u201d This appeal to the bottom line seemed to tweak Trump\u2019s conscience. He gave Coulter an open invitation to    waiving the $100, 000 membership fee. The following evening at the next Republican debate, he exhibited considerably more restraint, for which Coulter, with characteristic modesty, claims credit. \u201cCoulter delivers!\u201d she told me. Some of Trump\u2019s supporters within the conservative media are attracted to his actual positions on issues. One is his trade policy, on which many media personalities on the right are considerably more populist and protectionist than Republican Party leaders and Chamber of Commerce boosters. Throughout Obama\u2019s presidency, Laura Ingraham has warned of China\u2019s predations: \u201cThe trade war is on, and we\u2019re losing it,\u201d she has often said. For others, Trump\u2019s assurance that he will appoint Antonin   conservatives to the Supreme Court is reason enough for their support. But Trump also simply fulfills the ineffable urge many have to, as Michael Needham, the chief executive of the conservative policy group Heritage Action for America, puts it, \u201cpunch Washington in the face. \u201d This is true for Coulter, who, in her newly published paean to the candidate, \u201cIn Trump We Trust,\u201d writes that Trump is fit for the presidency not in spite of his crudeness but because of it: \u201cOnly someone who brags about his airline\u2019s seatbelt buckles being made of solid gold would have the balls to do what Trump is doing. \u201d But what really sold Coulter on Trump, she told me, was his hard line on immigration. Coulter told me that she had never given the issue much thought during her childhood in New Canaan, Conn. and her student days at Cornell. Then in 1992, the   journalist Peter Brimelow wrote a   essay for National Review titled \u201cTime to Rethink Immigration?\u201d which would later become a sort of   for today\u2019s   the ascendant   movement that has found its champion in Trump. Brimelow cast the current wave of American immigrants in dismal terms: less skilled, less European, less assimilated, less   and less Republican than the previous newcomers. Coulter, who was 31 and a law clerk at the time, remembers reading it and thinking, \u201cOh, my gosh, I\u2019ve been completely lied to!\u201d   years later, Coulter helped formulate Trump\u2019s   position, which she hailed on Twitter as \u201cthe greatest political document since the Magna Carta. \u201d (Her additional tweet on the subject  \u2014   \u201cI don\u2019t care if @realDonaldTrump wants to perform abortions in the White House after this immigration policy paper\u201d  \u2014   prompted Mark Levin to tweet back, \u201cThese have to be among the most pathetic comments of anyone in a long time. \u201d) Coulter has not always gotten her way with the candidate. At    that evening in March, she lobbied unsuccessfully for him to pick as his running mate Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, who is credited with selling Mitt Romney on \u201c . \u201d And her book tour for \u201cIn Trump We Trust\u201d hit a momentary snag when Trump told Sean Hannity that he would be open to \u201csoftening\u201d his immigration stance, though Coulter chose to believe that, as she told me, \u201cit was Hannity badgering him. \u201d Still, she has become the Trump campaign\u2019s most unrepentant brawler. When Khzir Khan, the   father of a U. S. Army captain who was killed in combat in Iraq, spoke critically of Trump at the Democratic National Convention, Coulter wrote on Twitter: \u201cYou know what this convention really needed: An angry Muslim with a thick accent like Fareed Zacaria[sic]. \u201d That tweet provoked disgust from fellow conservatives, among them Erick Erickson, who tweeted: \u201cWhat a terrible thing to say about a man whose son died for this country. \u201d When I reminded Coulter of Erickson\u2019s scolding, she let out a hearty laugh. \u201cI always hated him,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is one of the fantastic things. In any political movement, there are many people you think are losers and dorks, but your friends talk you into liking them, because they\u2019re on our side. Now all of those people are out. \u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cTrump has made my life better in so many ways. \u201d You will not find copies of \u201c\u00a1Adios, America!\u201d or \u201cIn Trump We Trust\u201d on any of the many bookshelves in the home of the Washington Post columnist George Will. A week after Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican presidential race in early May, Will and his wife, Mari, a Republican political consultant, gave a catered dinner party for Cruz and his wife, Heidi. The other guests were conservative donors, activists and journalists, along with their spouses. The Wills have been hosting these    encounters with political celebrities at their Maryland home for decades. In early 2009, Will\u2019s fellow conservative columnists gathered there to meet Obama a week before his inauguration. Among the guests that evening in May was Laura Ingraham. Ingraham is of proudly   heritage  \u2014   her mother was a waitress for almost 30 years and her father owned and operated a    carwash  \u2014   and does not share Will\u2019s reverence for decorum. She was an early defender of Trump\u2019s willingness to say things \u201cno one else is saying. \u201d While interviewing Cruz on her radio show six weeks before the Wills\u2019 party, she interrupted him to mock his Harvard Law degree. Still, Cruz knew that his political future relied on conservative   like Ingraham, and it was at his request that the Wills included her in the party. Over cocktails, the Cruzes spoke fondly of their experiences on the campaign trail, and the other guests listened politely, mindful of Cruz\u2019s recent humiliating defeat. Then midway through dinner, at a table set with glasses once used by Abraham Lincoln, Ingraham insisted that Cruz needed to throw his weight behind the man who had branded him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted. \u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t endorse him, where does that leave you?\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the public and you don\u2019t have the establishment. How can you be a leader of the conservative movement?\u201d Cruz amiably replied that such a decision did not have to be made right away. Others at the table joined in to defend him, but Ingraham would hear nothing of it. \u201cYou can\u2019t want Hillary Clinton elected,\u201d she goaded him. Will sat fuming silently. \u201cShe was quite animated,\u201d he would later recall. Cruz refused to offer his support to Trump that night or in the weeks to follow. Speaking at the Republican convention on July 20 moments before Cruz was to do the same, Ingraham taunted him: \u201cWe should all, even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos  \u2014   and we love you, we love you  \u2014   but you must honor the pledge to support Donald Trump now, tonight!\u201d The following morning on her radio show, Ingraham declared that Cruz\u2019s refusal to endorse had \u201ceffectively ended his political career. \u201d Will was no more persuaded by Ingraham than Cruz was. The first and only time Will met Trump was in March 1995, when, at Trump\u2019s invitation, he gave a speech at   . Years later on Twitter, Trump would ascribe Will\u2019s harsh view of him to Will\u2019s having \u201ctotally bombed\u201d with his performance that night. Will told me: \u201cHe started telling this story: \u2018The reason Will doesn\u2019t like me is I invited him to give a speech at    and I knew it was going to be boring, so I waited out on the patio.\u2019 Which raises two questions. First, if he knew it was going to be that boring, why did he invite me? And second, who would be the guy with the orange hair sitting in the front row?\u201d Will said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d in 2012 that Trump was \u201ca bloviating ignoramus\u201d and he has spent much of the past year predicting the candidate\u2019s imminent political demise. \u201cI thought even an entertaining bore could be a bore after a while,\u201d he told me. By late December of last year, however, his contempt had given way to alarm. \u201cConservatives\u2019 highest priority,\u201d he wrote in a Post column, \u201cmust be to prevent Trump from winning the Republican nomination\u201d  \u2014   even if it meant Hillary Clinton\u2019s election. Then on June 2, three weeks after his dinner party for Cruz, Will learned that his friend and fellow Republican Paul Ryan, the House speaker, had endorsed the nominee. Will considered the matter over martinis at home that evening. The next morning, he walked into his office and told his assistant: \u201cGo change my registration. This is not my party anymore. \u201d Recently I visited Will at his office, a   Georgetown brick rowhouse erected in 1811. Its walls are covered with framed photographs, several of them depicting the writer in his youth alongside Reagan and other titans of his former party. The dean of conservative pundits, now 75, wore a crisp pinstripe shirt and gray slacks, his customary owlish Mona Lisa expression a bit tighter than usual, owing to the subject matter. Will told me that he cast his first vote in 1964, for Barry Goldwater. He voted for the Republican candidate in every succeeding presidential election, until now. \u201cI don\u2019t use the word \u2018frightening\u2019 often,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s frightening to know this person\u201d  \u2014   Trump  \u2014   \u201cwould have the   codes. The world is getting really dangerous. His friend Mr. Putin is dismantling a nation in the center of Europe. Some   captain of a Chinese boat with    missiles might make a mistake in the next three years near the Spratly Islands. All kinds of things can go wrong. And the idea that this guy will be asked to respond in a sober, firm way? My goodness. \u201d He seemed genuinely despondent. \u201cGiven that, could you see yourself urging your readers to vote for Hillary Clinton?\u201d I asked. Will\u2019s lips pursed slightly. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s clear from everything I\u2019ve written that I think she\u2019d be a better president. That said, I\u2019m not going to vote for her. First of all, I\u2019m a Maryland voter. She couldn\u2019t lose Maryland if she tried. \u201d \u201cThen. . .. \u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t decided,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can imagine  \u2014   I get tons of emails: \u2018I, too, have left the Republican Party. What should I do?\u2019 Well, there are a number of legitimate options. Not voting is a legitimate expression of opinion. \u201d Ingraham and other conservative media personalities hailed Trump for having \u201ctapped into\u201d a shared and seething disquiet among predominantly white,    voters. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand on the part of those being tapped into,\u201d Will told me, \u201cis: What exactly do they want? I can think of nothing the American people have wanted intensely and protractedly that they didn\u2019t get. Took a while, but they got it. \u201d With a resigned   he looked at the ground and intoned, in the manner of a   monologue: \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be yuge. And it\u2019s all gonna get fixed. And we\u2019re all gonna be winners. \u201d \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t build that wall, I\u2019m pissed,\u201d Sean Hannity told me, reflecting on the prospects of a Trump presidency in the office of his radio show in Midtown Manhattan. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t repeal Obamacare, I\u2019m gonna be pissed. If he appoints a liberal jurist to the Supreme Court, I\u2019m gonna lose my mind. And by the way: I\u2019ll be screaming. Not talking  \u2014   screaming about it. But in fairness, if Trump doesn\u2019t keep his promises, you can also blame me, because I believed him. \u201d Although Coulter was Trump\u2019s earliest cheerleader among prominent   personalities, Hannity\u2019s stake in the election perhaps runs deepest of all, if only because of the size of his audience. He hosts the    show (after Limbaugh) on talk radio and the    program (after Bill O\u2019Reilly and Megyn Kelly) on cable news. More than 2. 4 million weekly viewers and 13 million listeners have witnessed Hannity sticking his neck out on behalf of a   politician and sometime Republican who has voiced support for Planned Parenthood while vowing to limit America\u2019s military footprint and shred trade deals that the G. O. P. has backed for decades. Hannity\u2019s critics on the right have accused him of essentially running hourlong daily Trump infomercials. When I asked him about this, Hannity responded with a   litany of sins perpetrated by the Republican establishment in concert with Obama: perilously low labor participation and homeownership rates, soaring national debt, Obamacare and so on. A Clinton presidency, he warned, would be \u201cObama on steroids. \u201d These were his motivations. \u201cMy conscience is clear. And I feel like Donald Trump would be a great president. \u201d Hannity told me that he had in fact never stayed at a Trump hotel property, played on a Trump golf course or visited   . \u201cI have my own place  \u2014   on the other Florida coast, in Naples,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need his place. I always got the sense people were asking him for something. I don\u2019t believe in asking for free stuff. \u201d Nonetheless, the two men have a mutual affinity that has spanned at least two decades. The MSNBC \u201cMorning Joe\u201d host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough theorized to me that their relationship has a psychological underpinning: \u201cDonald Trump, Sean Hannity, Bill O\u2019Reilly all share the same resentment that they will never be accepted into Manhattan\u2019s polite society no matter what they do. \u201d (Trump is from Queens Hannity and O\u2019Reilly are from Long Island.) Trump, in a recent phone conversation, offered me a somewhat simpler explanation: \u201cSean likes having me on his show, and that has to do with ratings more than anything else. \u201d No presidential candidate in history, Hannity told me, understands television better than Trump  \u2014   \u201cnot even close. \u201d On this score, I couldn\u2019t disagree. One evening this past spring, on his plane after a campaign event in Buffalo, Trump told me that at rallies, he always made a point of finding the TV cameras at the back of the media pen and noticing whether a red light was flickering. \u201cThat means they\u2019re airing it live,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo I make sure to say something new\u201d  \u2014   by which he meant newsworthy, the better to own the next news cycle. Trump was a TV star for more than a decade before he became a politician he watches TV news incessantly and understands the medium intimately. He knows the optimal time slots on the morning shows. He   the   lighting. He is not only on speaking terms with every network chief executive but also knows their booking agents. He monitors the opinions of hosts and regular guests more avidly than most media critics do and works them obsessively, often directly. Scarborough told me that Trump\u2019s family  \u2014   particularly Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner  \u2014   sometimes asked him for advice, and more than once \u201ccalled me and asked me to get him off the ledge. I\u2019ve said, \u2018I can do that, but six hours later he\u2019s going to revert to form.\u2019 I told Jared at one point: \u2018Jared, your    listens to me more when I\u2019m attacking him on television than when I\u2019m trying to convince him to be rational for the sake of the party.\u2019 I think he\u2019s a creature of TV. \u201d TV networks, in the mainstream as well as conservative media, have profited handsomely from Trump\u2019s   theatrics, but some of their   personalities like Hannity are drawn to him for reasons apart from ratings. The prospect of getting in on the ground floor of a Trump administration that is short on policy ideas and disdainful of old Washington hands amounts to a     opportunity. By employing the Breitbart publisher Steve Bannon, and by including both Ingraham and Roger Ailes in his debate preparations, Trump has implicitly encouraged the conservative media to consider itself part of the campaign team. I asked Hannity if it was true that, as a Trump confidant had told me, he wished to be considered as a potential Trump White House chief of staff. \u201cThat\u2019s news to me,\u201d he insisted, adding a politician\u2019s practiced nondenial denial: \u201cI have radio and TV contracts that I will honor through December 2020. \u201d Nonetheless, Hannity\u2019s service to the Trump campaign well exceeds that of ritually bashing Clinton and giving Trump free airtime. He has offered private strategic advice to the campaign. The same Trump confidant told me of at least one instance in which Hannity drafted an unsolicited memo outlining the message Trump should offer after the Orlando nightclub shooting in June. In public, Hannity has made it his mission to warn fellow conservatives  \u2014   naming names, like the columnist Jonah Goldberg and the National Review editor in chief Rich Lowry  \u2014   that if they do not soon climb aboard the Trump train they will, as the hashtag threatens, #OwnIt: Clinton\u2019s picks for the Supreme Court, her response to the Islamic State, her trade deals, all of it. Hannity maintains that his scolding of Trump\u2019s conservative dissenters derives from his fear of a Clinton presidency. \u201cIt\u2019d be pretty much over,\u201d he said. Taken alone, George Will or even National Review might have little impact on Trump\u2019s standing in the race, Hannity argued, but \u201ccumulatively they do. I can look at the poll numbers. If you go back to a month ago, he was garnering 73 percent of the Republican vote. The most recent, I think he had 88 percent. He needs to get to 93. \u201d And the key to the last 5 percent might very well lie with the noisy holdouts, like Erick Erickson. On Sept. 16, Erickson showed up at the National Press Club in Washington to participate in a debate sponsored by the National Religious Broadcasters. Erickson left RedState at the end of last year to concentrate on his radio show and his online opinion journal, The Resurgent, but he has remained influential among conservatives who do not support Trump. In July, when he learned that Ted Cruz was about to have a private meeting with the nominee on the eve of the convention, Erickson texted the senator: \u201cDon\u2019t endorse! Don\u2019t endorse!\u201d Later that evening, Erickson says, Cruz texted back: \u201cDidn\u2019t endorse! Didn\u2019t endorse!\u201d (Cruz finally announced that he would vote for Trump on Sept. 23.) The subject of the debate, inevitably, was Trump: specifically, whether evangelical Christians should support him. Being a lifelong evangelical himself, Erickson had some thoughts on the matter. Over the years, he had been condemned for his own offensive words, like the time he called the Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis \u201cAbortion Barbie. \u201d But he had recently apologized for many (though not all) of these statements and had called upon Trump to affect a similar posture of Christian humility. \u201c1 Corinthians is very explicit,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf someone holds one\u2019s self out to be a Christian and doesn\u2019t behave that way, Christians are supposed to judge him. This is a guy who\u2019s bragged about his affairs. \u201d This was Erickson\u2019s principal argument during the debate. Trump was not merely a sinner, he said, but a gleefully unrepentant one. Erickson\u2019s debate opponent, the Christian   host and fervent Trump supporter Janet Parshall, responded by reciting a litany of sinners in chief  \u2014   from Thomas Jefferson with the    child he fathered with a slave, to Warren G. Harding with his multiple liaisons, to Richard Nixon with his foul language memorialized on the White House tapes. \u201cWe are not electing a messiah,\u201d Parshall said. \u201cLast time I checked, he was appointed to office and he is not  . \u201d Erickson\u2019s debating partner, the conservative activist Bill Wichterman, argued that Trump appealed to the worst in America: His bullying, his lying and his bigotry were \u201ccorrosive to our national character. \u201d Erickson could testify to this. At one point, he was receiving as many as 300 emails a day from Trump supporters. Some of them referred to him as a \u201ccuck\u201d or \u201c . \u201d The word  \u2014   a   derivative of \u201ccuckold\u201d  \u2014   was new to Erickson, as were its originators in the    . More than one of the emails predicted that Erickson would be shot to death. At the local grocery store, a man walked up to Erickson\u2019s two young children \u201cand told them they needed to know their father was destroying this country by supporting Hillary Clinton,\u201d Erickson told me. And one evening, two people showed up on the Ericksons\u2019 doorstep to deliver a threat  \u2014   Erickson would not tell me what it was  \u2014   explicit enough that he later hired security guards. \u201cI\u2019ve never had Obama or Romney or McCain or Clinton supporters come to my home or send me nasty letters,\u201d he said. Did Trump beget all of this? If so, what begot Trump? Erickson argued that the fault lay with Beltway Republicans. \u201cThey\u2019ve broken so many promises,\u201d he said. \u201cThey promised to defund the president\u2019s immigration plan. They promised to defund Obamacare. They promised to fight the president on raising the debt limit. At some point, the base of the party just wants to burn the house down and start over. \u201d But even Erickson did not seem convinced that this alone explained what he saw as a nihilistic turn among Republican voters. \u201cI do think there are a lot of people that have just concluded that this is it  \u2014   that if we don\u2019t get the election right, the country\u2019s over,\u201d he said. As to where they might have gotten that idea, Erickson knew the answer. It was the apocalyptic hymn sung by   hosts like his friend and mentor Rush Limbaugh, whose show Erickson once   though in the time of Trump, it seemed unlikely he would receive another invitation. This February, Limbaugh, who has applauded Trump without endorsing him outright, posed to Erickson the question of whether a commentator should try to act as \u201cthe guardian of what it means to be a conservative. \u201d In effect, the legend of talk radio was laying down an unwritten commandment of the trade, which applies as well to cable TV: Do not attempt to lead your following. This was simple enough for an avowed Trump supporter like Ingraham. \u201cLaura\u2019s never missed an opportunity to build her career on the backs of others,\u201d Erickson told me. He counted Hannity as another mentor and admired his entrepreneurial cunning, saying: \u201cSean reflects his audience. He\u2019s not going to leave his audience. \u201d On his own radio show, Erickson found that the more he denounced Trump, the more female listeners he picked up. But most of the 300, 000 people who tuned in weekly during rush hour were men. While Erickson refused to abandon his principles, he did not wish to go broke, either. On Sept. 20, Erickson wrote a long post for The Resurgent titled \u201cReconsidering My Opposition to Donald Trump. \u201d He made no effort to disguise his moroseness. \u201cI see the election of Hillary Clinton as the antithesis of all my values and ideas on what fosters sound civil society in this country,\u201d he wrote, and described his manifold objections to her at great length. But, he went on, \u201cI have to admit that while I may view Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign as   I view Donald Trump\u2019s campaign as  . . .. While I see Clinton as having no virtue, I see Donald Trump corrupting the virtuous and fostering hatred, racism and dangerous strains of nationalism. \u201d The election left him adrift. \u201cI am without a candidate. I just cannot vote for either one. \u201d And so Erickson\u2019s conscience led him back to where he was 13 months ago. Nowadays, he told me, he was doing all he could to avoid discussing Trump and the election altogether  \u2014   a tall order for a   host. Responding to my look of bewilderment, he said, \u201cWhy dwell on the train wreck?\u201d Erickson believed he was not alone. \u201cPeople know where we\u2019re headed, don\u2019t like where we\u2019re headed and would rather talk about something else,\u201d he said. Erickson had won many fights. This one was the biggest yet, and he had lost. There was nothing left to do but step back from his megaphone, dwell on happier matters and wait for the next righteous cause.'"}, "time": 1742628322.7900453}
