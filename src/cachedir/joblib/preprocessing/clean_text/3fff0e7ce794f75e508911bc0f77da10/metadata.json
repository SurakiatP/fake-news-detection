Trump, possibly have in store for us now? No doubt about it: Campaign 2016 has been a smash hit. And to the news media have gone the spoils. With Mr. Trump providing   TV theatrics, cable news has drawn record audiences. Newspapers have reached online readership highs that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. On Wednesday comes the reckoning. The election news bubble that\u2019s about to pop has blocked from plain view the expanding financial sinkhole at the center of the    branch of the news industry, which has recently seen a print advertising plunge that was \u201cmuch more precipitous, to be honest with you, than anybody expected a year or so ago,\u201d as The Wall Street Journal editor in chief Gerard Baker told me on Friday. Papers including The Journal, The New York Times, The Guardian, the Gannett publications and others have responded with plans to reorganize, shed staff, kill off whole sections, or all of the above. Taken together, it means another rapid depletion in the nation\u2019s ranks of traditionally trained journalists whose main mission is to root out corruption, hold the powerful accountable and sort fact from fiction for voters. It couldn\u2019t be happening at a worse moment in American public life. The   forces that are eating away at print advertising are enabling a host of   players to pollute the democracy with dangerously fake news items. In the last couple of weeks, Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets have exposed millions of Americans to false stories asserting that: the Clinton campaign\u2019s pollster, Joel Benenson, wrote a secret memo detailing plans to \u201csalvage\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy by launching a radiological attack to halt voting (merrily shared on Twitter by Roger Stone, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign) the Clinton campaign senior strategist John Podesta practiced an occult ritual involving various bodily fluids Mrs. Clinton is paying public pollsters to skew results (shared on Twitter by Donald Trump Jr.) there is a trail of supposedly suspicious deaths of myriad Clinton foes (which The Times\u2019s Frank Bruni heard repeated in a hotel lobby in Ohio). As Mike Cernovich, a Twitter star,   news provocateur and promoter of Clinton health conspiracies, boasted in last week\u2019s New Yorker, \u201cSomeone like me is perceived as the new Fourth Estate. \u201d His content can live alongside that of The Times or The Boston Globe or The Washington Post on the Facebook newsfeed and be just as well read, if not more so. On Saturday he called on a President Trump to disband the White House press corps. He may not have to. All you have to do is look at the effect of the Gannett cuts on its Washington staff, which Politico recently likened to a \u201cblood bath. \u201d Even before this year\u2019s ad revenue drop, the number of   daily journalists  \u2014   nearly 33, 000 according to the 2015 census conducted by the American Society of News Editors and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Florida International University  \u2014   was on the way to being half what it was in 2000. That contraction in the reporting corps, combined with the success of disinformation this year, is making for some sleepless nights for those in Washington who will have to govern in this bifurcated,     environment. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest crisis facing our democracy, the failing business model of real journalism,\u201d Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri and a longtime critic of fake news, told me on Saturday. Ms. McCaskill said that \u201cjournalism is partly to blame\u201d for being slow to adjust as the internet turned its business model upside down and social media opened the competitive floodgates. \u201cFake news got way out ahead of them,\u201d she said. It does not augur well for the future. Martin Baron, the Washington Post executive editor, said when we spoke last week, \u201cIf you have a society where people can\u2019t agree on basic facts, how do you have a functioning democracy?\u201d The cure for fake journalism is an overwhelming dose of good journalism. And how well the news media gets through its postelection hangover will have a lot to do with how the next chapter in the American political story is told. That\u2019s why the dire financial reports from American newsrooms are so troubling. If the national reporting corps is going to be reduced even more during such an   readership boom, what are things going to look like when the circus leaves town? I surveyed the higher precincts of the industry last week, and what I found wasn\u2019t entirely gloomy there was even some cause for optimism. But there\u2019s going to be a lot of   and some bloodletting on the way to deliverance. It\u2019s pretty much taken as a given that the news audience will largely shrink next year, despite what is expected to be a compelling news environment. \u201cIs anything in 2017, politically speaking, going to be as sexy as it was in 2016? I\u2019m not going to play poker at that table,\u201d Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, told me on Friday. Still, though he\u2019s predicting a ratings fall of 30 percent or perhaps \u201cmuch more\u201d at MSNBC, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have financial pressure on my bottom line. \u201d That\u2019s not only because MSNBC and its competitors earned tens of millions of unexpected   dollars this year, but also because they still draw substantial income from cable subscriber fees. Newspapers are the originators of that   setup. But as lucrative print ads dwindle, and Facebook and Google gobble up more than   of the online advertising market, affecting   outlets, too, newspapers are scrambling to build up their subscriber bases and break their reliance on print ads. Mr. Baker of The Journal said he was confident that newspapers could make the transition but acknowledged a rough interim period that will require cuts and will be even harder to navigate or survive for smaller, regional papers (a practical invitation to municipal corruption). The cause for relative optimism comes from the performance of some of the more ambitious,   newspaper articles of the last year. The Times article revealing Mr. Trump\u2019s nearly $1 billion tax loss in 1995 drew some 5. 5 million page views. That\u2019s huge. The Washington Post doesn\u2019t share its numbers, but behold the more than 13, 000 online comments attached to just one of David A. Fahrenthold\u2019s articles about how Mr. Trump ran his charity in ways that clashed with philanthropic moral conventions. But in this new era, subscriber numbers are more important than    readership. Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, The Times\u2019s newly named deputy publisher, pointed to a bright spot in last week\u2019s earnings report. Mixed in with a   drop in print advertising revenue (!) was a 21 percent increase in digital advertising and, more important, the addition of 116, 000 new   subscriptions. The Times now has nearly 1. 6 million subscribers to its   offerings. \u201cIt shows people are willing to pay for great, original, deeply reported and expert journalism,\u201d Mr. Sulzberger said. \u201cThat will allow great journalism to thrive. \u201d It could be Pollyannaish to think so, but maybe this year\u2019s explosion in fake news will serve to raise the value of real news. If so, it will be great journalism that saves journalism. \u201cPeople will ultimately gravitate toward sources of information that are truly reliable, and have an allegiance to telling the truth,\u201d Mr. Baron said. \u201cPeople will pay for that because they\u2019ll realize they\u2019ll need to have that in our society. \u201d As The Times\u2019s national political correspondent Jonathan Martin wrote on Twitter last week, \u201cFolks, subscribe to a paper. Democracy demands it. \u201d Or don\u2019t. You\u2019ll get what you pay for.'"}, "time": 1742563194.2388184}
