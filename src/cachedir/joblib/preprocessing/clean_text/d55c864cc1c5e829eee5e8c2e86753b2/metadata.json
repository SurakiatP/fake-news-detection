It hasn\u2019t even tried to hide its bias in an attempt to destroy Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s chances at becoming president.\\nOver the weekend, CNN tried desperately to find anything it could to distract the American people from the FBI\u2019s announcement that it was reopening the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of an email server while she was secretary of state.\\nCNN ran a story on Sunday about a Trump rally in Colorado, only it blatantly lied about what Trump said at the rally in an attempt to smear him, Mediate reported .\\nThe article in question originally ran with the headline \u201cTrump, skeptical of mail-in balloting, encourages voting more than once if necessary.\u201d Here\u2019s a screen grab of the original.\\n\u201cIf you go to university center, they\u2019ll give you a new ballot, they\u2019ll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,\u201d Trump said at the rally, according to CNN\u2019s original article.\\nHowever there was more to that quote, which CNN decided not to run with.\\n\u201cIf you go to university center, they\u2019ll give you a new ballot, they\u2019ll void your old ballot. They\u2019ll give you a new ballot, and you can go out and make sure it get\u2019s in. Now in some places, they do that four or five times, but we don\u2019t do that. So by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,\u201d is the full quote of what Trump said.\\nBy selectively editing the quote, CNN made it appear that Trump was encouraging voter fraud.\\nAfter publishing the original story, CNN changed the headline, and the content, to actually reflect what Trump actually said. Initially, the network did not indicate it had done so. However, a line was later added at the end of the article to indicate it had been changed.\\nThe new headline can be seen below:\\n\\nCNN also took down the tweet that had the incorrect headline.\\nMaybe next time CNN will think twice before publishing such blatant lies. Instead of trying to cover up Clinton\u2019s corruption, maybe the network should just to its job and report on the news.\\nThis is what the media is doing these days, they chop speeches, edit them, falsify them! Let this be a warning to you for any future BS that may come out from the media. No matter how much they hype it. Do NOT believe anything the media tells you!\\nYou know what you have to do, go out and vote for Trump! Avoid electronic voting because the machines are owned by George Soros, a Clinton donor, request paper ballot because they are obligated by the law and if they refuse to give you a paper ballot, make a scene, call the cops on them.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742628487.9499052}
