Although this makes me technically a red diaper baby, I rejected all that baloney early on. These days, I write stories - mostly comedy science fiction - as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice, political commentary, and my writing projects. November 15, 2016 Culture \\nJohn Walker Lindh grew up in the Washington, D.C. area. His family brought him to California when he was ten. In another ten years, he would become known as the American Taliban. While in Afghanistan, he was known as Sulayman al-Faris, one of several Arabic monikers he\u2019s used over the years. Johnny joins the jihad There are moments when one realizes one\u2019s vacation is really starting to suck. \\nWhen he was twelve, the young Lindh saw Spike Lee\u2019s rather hagiographic film biography about Malcolm X. That began his fascination with Islam. While a teenager, he used the evocative email [email protected] and made several postings about rap music on Usenet. Sometimes he pretended to be Black, even having the nerve to \u201cdis\u201d Dr. Dre : \\n$hort Dog does hip hop no glory Wack like Dr Dre and his made-up gangster stories Sellout house nigga living honkey dory Saying he\u2019s broke in his own pool doing laps All these playground MC\u2019s fall off like scabs Skills disappear like alaka abracadab \\nDr Dre\u2019s a disgrace selling out to the talcolm He\u2019ll be left dead and naked in the outcome Word to brother Malcolm Dre shirts and hat\u2019s when will we see his cereal? \\nSo who\u2019s the poseur there, anyway? I\u2019m not sure whether to laugh at the sheer impertinence, or cry at the abuse of the English language. \\nWhen he was sixteen, he formally converted, beginning his fateful journey. Meanwhile, his family situation was on shaky ground. His father turned gay , living part-time with his male lover , and eventually divorced. \\nJohn began his world travels, twice venturing to Yemen, both times for nearly a year. Later, he stayed at a Pakistani madrassa. In May 2001, he went to Afghanistan to fight on behalf of the Taliban. Unfortunately for him, after September 11, American forces went to war with the Taliban. He was captured on November 25 after his unit surrendered in Kunduz. \\nThe CIA questioned him, and he claimed to be an Irishman. (That must have been an interesting conversation, perhaps \u201cAch, begorrah, top o\u2019 the mornin\u2019 to ye!\u201d Presumably, pretending to be black again wouldn\u2019t have gotten him very far.) Shortly after, the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising , and Lindh escaped. Hundreds died, including Mike Spann, one of his interrogators. After that, he was recaptured and\u2014following some rough treatment, not that I\u2019m shedding any tears about it\u2014questioned again. He announced defiantly that he wasn\u2019t in the Taliban, but rather Al Qaeda. His actions sealed his doom. \\nFighting for the Taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part. His actions after being captured were even dumber. What could he have done differently? In the beginning, he could\u2019ve said he was interested in Islam, and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad. Then he could have lied and told them he was press-ganged into the Taliban, and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen. \\nHe could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attempt\u2014potentially sparing many lives on both sides\u2014as well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself. Had he given a helpful warning about the uprising, likely they would\u2019ve concluded he was small fry and let him go. After that, he could\u2019ve become the star of the daytime TV talk shows. Then he could\u2019ve given speeches on the anti-war circuit, helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really aren\u2019t that bad or whatever. \\nInstead, he ended up faced with ten criminal charges, which could\u2019ve meant three life sentences plus ninety years. Finally getting smart, he copped a plea for twenty years, with the possibility of three off for good behavior. Now, he\u2019s in Federal prison, making the news back in 2012 by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer . What went wrong? \\n\\nAs Bush the Elder put it, Lindh was \u201csome misguided Marin County hot-tubber.\u201d Later, he apologized profusely for the remark. Still, I have to say that Bush 41 was onto something with that one; all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts . \\nThings could\u2019ve been different. Lindh didn\u2019t have to become a renegade. If he\u2019d made other choices, he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society, rather than counting the days in a prison cell. Still, his environment bears some responsibility for what he became. \\nHe was raised in the Catholic faith, but a stronger grounding in it\u2014as well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about Islam to balance out the picture \u2014might have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad. (A liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all that\u2019s bad. Or has liberalism become too wishy-washy to assert its own values?) There wasn\u2019t much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path; his mother converted to Buddhism and his father left for the gay community. \\nFor that matter, if he had acquired an appreciation for good music\u2014be it Mozart or Metallica\u2014perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have been so fascinated by irritating rap music. What kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be Black and laughably accuses Dr. Dre of selling out? On that note, as for Malcolm X, didn\u2019t Lindh have some cultural icons of his own? I have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own Irish-American heritage. \\nAll this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an \u201c anything goes \u201d environment. Islam speaks in absolutes, enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct, and they fight for what they believe in. (I can\u2019t fault them too much for that, although I disagree with their theology and actions on many points.) \\nGoing further, Islam offers paradise for believers\u2014promising seventy virgins to their martyrs\u2014and eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned; there\u2019s nothing wishy-washy about it. Indeed, embracing radical Islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the \u201canything goes\u201d world view. I certainly don\u2019t agree with Lindh\u2019s choices, but I can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism . \\nThis certainly isn\u2019t the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy. Jane Fonda\u2019s North Vietnam adventure comes to mind; an action she now regrets. More recently, there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in Iraq for their pal Saddam. For all their posturing, none of them got themselves blown up over there. (Leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified, 500 fewer Social Justice Warriors would\u2019ve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit.) \\nThen there\u2019s the odd case of Matthew Todd Miller , a Californian who went to North Korea, tore up his visa, and announced he was seeking political asylum. That one\u2019s an iffy case though; later he said \u201cI just wanted to speak to an ordinary North Korean person about normal things.\u201d Kids these days\u2026 In summary Don\u2019t let this happen to our youth. They must not grow up culturally bereft. \\nIn times past, children were taught about their country\u2019s heritage, instructed in their culture, and pride in their nation was instilled in them. It was a given that these were presented as good things. These days\u2014at least in much of the Western world\u2014this isn\u2019t happening. We can\u2019t count on the educational system\u2014and certainly the media\u2014to do that any more. \\nBecause of decades of cultural Marxism , young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization. \u201cAll societies, beliefs, and ways of life are equal, except yours are terrible.\u201d Those who don\u2019t see through that baloney end up rootless, alienated, and disconnected from their own culture. Some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful. This is basically what Social Justice Weenies think, something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue. \\nThis will have to change, of course. Hopefully, the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural Marxism are standing in the unemployment line. For now, we\u2019ll have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing, and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity. Teach them about their roots and why that\u2019s important. Don\u2019t let the TV be your child\u2019s babysitter. \u201cAnything goes\u201d is not a standard by which to raise our youth.\""}, "time": 1742561656.072656}
