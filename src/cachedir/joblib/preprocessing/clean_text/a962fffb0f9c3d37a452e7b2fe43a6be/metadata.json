Donald Trump needs to pivot fast on his core economic program and embrace cutting payroll taxes for the working class, not income taxes for the elites. That means jettisoning the campaign's $3.3 trillion individual income tax cut (10-years), which reflects warmed over GOP dogma about a Laffer Curve that has gone missing.
