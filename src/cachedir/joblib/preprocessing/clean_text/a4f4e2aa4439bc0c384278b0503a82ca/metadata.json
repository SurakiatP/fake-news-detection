Bernie Sanders (I. ) said Trump \u201cdid not tell the truth\u201d based on what he said during the campaign and what he has done so far as president of the United States.  \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. I mean, the point here is that, I think, all over grassroots America, whether they\u2019re Democrats, independents or Republicans, people are perceiving that Trump did not tell the truth in his campaign in terms of what he would do as president of the United States,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe was going to drain the swamp. Well, he\u2019s, in fact, appointed more billionaires to his Cabinet than any president in history, etc. etc. So, what I think has happened now, in Kansas, it is true that the Democratic candidate lost. It is true that the Democratic Party should have put more resources into that election. But it is also true that he ran 20 points better than the  \u2014   than the Democratic candidate for president did in Kansas. \u201d \u201cSo, what you\u2019re seeing in Kansas, what you\u2019re seeing in Georgia, I believe you\u2019re going to see it in Montana, I believe you\u2019re going to see it all over this country, is the many   red states, working people are going to wake up and say, wait a second,\u201d he continued. \u201cRepublicans want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and education, and they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent. No, that\u2019s not what we elected Trump to do. Yes, climate change is real. It\u2019s not a hoax. We got to move to sustainable energy. I think, all over this country, in red states and in blue states, people are beginning to stand up. They\u2019re beginning to fight back. They\u2019re demanding a government which does not just represent the billionaires, but represents the working class of this country.
