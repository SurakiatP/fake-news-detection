Bush, they don\u2019t know better. There are a lot of people who have lived in a relatively benign bubble, like young women who just assume that Roe v. Wade will always be the law of the land. I think that there\u2019s an innocence that is informing a lot of people\u2019s desire not to vote, or to vote for Jill Stein, but it\u2019s because they\u2019ve had eight years of Obama. And I think that that innocence is making some of them naive and delusional. \\nHe then goes on to detail just why a Donald Trump presidency is enough of a threat for him to be so undiplomatic in his approach. \\nI think there is something seriously broken inside him where he\u2019s an actual sociopath and on the spectrum pretty close to being a psychopath. He\u2019s done nothing to indicate that he\u2019s even capable of feeling empathy [for anyone] except for himself. \\n[A Trump presidency would be] death by 1,000 Republican cuts. It basically gives the NRA the ability to write gun policy. It gives the coal industry and the oil industry the ability to write energy policy. It\u2019s handing the keys to people who want to advance policy measures that are just \u2014 again, I try and be diplomatic, but they\u2019re trying to advance policy measures to protect their corporate interests or protect their personal interests but to the egregious detriment of our country. \\nWith Trump, you get a belligerent racist who\u2019s most likely a sociopath [and] definitely a racist and misogynist with no governing experience. And with Hillary, you get an incredibly bright, progressive, strong, experienced legislator. There\u2019s no choice unless you\u2019re ignorant, delusional or racist. \\nHe\u2019s absolutely right on that point. While the \u201cdeath by 1,000 Republican cuts\u201d is the threat posed by any Republican candidate for the Presidency, the figure of Donald Trump is a threat to our Republic as we know it, and there can be only one choice. \\nI\u2019ve given more money to Democrats this cycle than I\u2019ve ever given in an election season. I\u2019ve done phone-banking, tweeted, Facebooked and Instagrammed, probably to my own personal detriment \u2014 the detriment of my friendships [and] certainly the detriment of my professional life \u2013 but honestly, the results of this election are more important than most. I\u2019d rather lose fans and have a hand in trying to keep Donald Trump out of the White House than trying to protect a career. A career pales in comparison to the health and wellbeing of our country and our planet. \\nWhat I learned a long time ago is if you\u2019re a public figure and you\u2019re opinionated and outspoken, people will hate you for it \u2014 even if they agree with what you\u2019re saying. But it\u2019s really nice: I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and at this point I just don\u2019t care. What\u2019s someone gonna do \u2014 not buy my records? It\u2019s 2016, no one buys records anyway.'"}, "time": 1742564030.6524222}
