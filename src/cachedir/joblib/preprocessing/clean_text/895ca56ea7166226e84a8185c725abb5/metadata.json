The cash prize will be transferred to their accounts to avoid any inconvenience. \\nSoon after the news of demonetization broke, thousands of people thronged ATMs in various cities to withdraw cash, and an equal number of articles, depicting their ordeal, were published on select media outlets. Talented writers across the nation gave wings to their imagination and produced heart-wrenching stories of middle and lower middle class families during an emergency-like situation inflicted on them by a fascist government. \\nExperts believe the decision of Sahitya Academy, to encourage budding writers in their creative pursuits, is a move in the right direction to revive literary fiction in India. \\nWe had a chance to interact with one of the writers whose story has been shortlisted by the committee, and we asked him about his story. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a murder mystery,\u201d he replied nonchalantly, \u201cThe story is about a man who kills someone at the ATM for 2500 rupees.\u201d \\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s something different from what we have read so far. Can you reveal some of the details?\u201d we asked. \\n\u201cOk, see this story is about a man who has to pay his rent on 14th\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t he already too late?\u201d \\n\u201cHe pays his rent on 14th. Do you have any problem with that? Now don\u2019t interrupt me when I am narrating the story. So, he has to pay a rent of 5000 rupees, and at the same time Modi bans all 500 and 1000 rupee notes\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cBut Modi announced this on 8th and he pays his rent on 14th. So he had 7 days to withdraw the cash.\u201d \\n\u201cHe was out of station.\u201d \\n\u201cBut there are ATMs in other\u2026ok, please continue.\u201d \\n\u201cSo, he logs into his account to transfer the fund to his landlord\u2019s account, but he cannot remember his password because of the situation created by Modi. He clicks forgot password option but his mobile runs out of battery.\u201d \\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d \\nWe grabbed a handful of popcorn as the story took an interesting twist. \\n\u201cHe rushes to the nearest ATM and withdraws 2500 rupees, but he needs another 2500,\u201d he paused for dramatic effect and said, \u201cHe kills a man standing in the queue.\u201d \\n\u201cIn front of so many people! Cannot they see him?\u201d \\n\u201cNo, because he is wearing a mask. Now he enters the ATM again and withdraws another 2500 rupees.\u201d \\n\u201cBut PIN\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cHaha, the PIN is his year of birth.\u201d \\n\u201cYou mean the murderer\u2019s or the victim\u2019s?\u201d \\n\u201cThe victim\u2019s of course because that\u2019s his card.\u201d \\n\u201cOh ok, but how did the murderer know his year of birth.\u201d \\n\u201cBecause in the same year Sachin Tendulkar made his international debut. Got it?\u201d \\n\u201cUmm, ok. But don\u2019t you think he could just kill the landlord instead of killing a random person?\u201d \\n\u201cNo, because he is getting married to his landlord\u2019s daughter.\u201d \\n\u201cOk so, how is this murder solved?\u201d \\n\u201cOk so, here\u2019s how it goes. No one knows who did it. Police is clueless\u2026but the ATM card is not.\u201d \\n\u201cOh\u2026my\u2026God, we completely forgot about the ATM card.\u201d \\n\u201cYes, now the card takes revenge on behalf of its owner.\u201d \\n\u201cLike how the dog did in Teri Meherbaniyan?\u201d \\n\u201cKind of, but the dog in Teri Meherbaniyan addresses the issue in an aggressive manner but the ATM card in my story opts for a subtle approach. The card has a camera on it and it clicks photographs of the killer, which it later sends to the police.\u201d \\n\u201cHow\u2026I mean, ok. So, does he get caught in the end?\u201d \\n\u201cFor that you have to read the entire story.\u201d \\n\u201cIs there anything left?\u201d \\n\u201cYes the final paragraph. So what do you think?\u201d \\n\u201cBrilliant! No wonder they selected your story. I mean, we got to know about Sahitya Academy Award only last year when a few recipients returned\u2026but I am sure, it\u2019s a huge recognition.\u201d \\n\u201cDo you think I have a chance of winning it?\u201d \\n\u201cAbsolutely. Keep up the good work. Bharat tere tukde honge ,\u201d we concluded the interview on a happy note.'"}, "time": 1742562003.2481308}
