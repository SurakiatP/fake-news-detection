Thirty minutes into my first visit, I was still waiting for him to reach the part where he would help me get over the end of my relationship. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean,\u201d I said. \u201cEasy, open breathing. Big lungfuls of air. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI breathe all the time. \u201d I tried steering the conversation myself. \u201cI just think I need to work out what happened  \u2014   \u2014   \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not interested in what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in the last time you breathed normally. You\u2019re a young, healthy woman. But your paperwork tells me you\u2019re struggling at work, haven\u2019t eaten a full meal in weeks and can\u2019t sleep. You need to fix that. \u201d I thought therapy would help convince me that the loss of the person I had been devoted to for years was a good thing. Instead, something in Allan\u2019s blunt insistence on the symptoms and not the cause had put me on my heels. He peered over his notepad. \u201cYou\u2019re all hunched up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look miserable. Your homework for next week is to do the exercises I\u2019ll email you. You\u2019ve got six sessions, and I want you breathing and sleeping properly by the end of it. \u201d Cycling home afterward, I had already dismissed Allan\u2019s words and returned to my regular programming: raking through the seven years since I had met my ex, mining memories for details of where it went wrong. We had started with two years of silent longing (me) and dating other people (him) before finally feeling our way into a life and home together in London. Until one painful, protracted summer, he left. I had always prided myself on being strong, on being able to bounce back, but here I was, months later, wrestling with questions without answers at night and awakening to a frightening bleakness. Lying awake that evening, I wondered if I was making a mistake in outsourcing my problems. Allan\u2019s focus on breathing sounded suspiciously like mindfulness to me. I had another long night ahead, though, so I groped around the bedsheets for my phone, and that\u2019s when I saw his promised email. \u201cDownload the app in the link below,\u201d it read. \u201cWhen you use it, imagine a place you feel happy and safe. Hold that image in your mind. Then focus on your breathing. Use the app each night before you go to sleep. Exercise. \u201d My mind cast around for the prescribed happy place, settling on a pebble beach on the south coast of England where I had spent childhood summers. I tried to remember its hard, smooth stones, the sounds of my brother yelling from the sea. The app, Positivity with Andrew Johnson, started. In a Scottish burr, a man counted down from 10. With a twinge of curiosity, I tried breathing in. Allan had a point: My chest was tight with tension. I attempted to push the air down, and my tummy distended like a child\u2019s. As I tried to synchronize my breathing, the vision of the beach kept escaping and then reappearing, interrupted by jags of thought. Still, I kept trying every night. Learning how to breathe was at least something different, a quick break from analyzing my own   love story with exhausting precision. When I visited Allan a few weeks later, our conversation turned to intuition. \u201cWhat does your gut tell you about what you should be doing?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy gut?\u201d I felt embarrassed. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything in there. \u201d I looked down hopefully at my stomach. Privately, I had always wondered what people meant by intuition. \u201cYou mentioned that you were nervous, that you often experienced anxiety from the start of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do you think that was?\u201d I have always relied on the flush of adrenaline to get stuff done. Yet a deeper, more frantic energy than usual had seeped in during the months before my boyfriend left. This tension pushed the vacuum cleaner faster round the living room and infused the meals I had started to make from cookbooks. Our apartment had never looked so tidy. On rainy Sundays, I urged him to make plans for a trip to Paris, which he wasn\u2019t keen on. \u201cI find it hard to believe that my body knew something was up before my brain did,\u201d I said, petulance creeping into my voice. \u201cIntuition is a sense developed from your past experiences, books you\u2019ve read, sounds on the street, conversations, facial expressions,\u201d Allan said. \u201cAll valuable information. It can help you to distinguish between what is real and what is fake, to notice something dangerous. Perhaps you trust your thoughts more, though. \u201d \u201cThoughts are all I have, surely,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s where all that information ends up getting used. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of research that would disagree with you. Why not try listening to your body instead of your head? That\u2019s where all your feelings have been coming from. \u201d Feelings. We hadn\u2019t talked about feelings at all. But as the weeks passed, I found that painful emotions, long ossified and remote, began overtaking me in humiliating ways. Tears streamed down my face in supermarkets my shoulders heaved silently on family car trips. My feelings were like the drunk who shows up too late to the party, misjudging the mood. Yet it was a strange relief to find I was capable of them. The tears were new, and they felt animal. Salt burned a rash around my eyelids in a way that I suspected wasn\u2019t entirely about the end of a relationship. The breakup had done something else: It had caused a crack, and the breathing only seemed to be making it wider. Earlier,   secrets and disasters found the fissure and out they came, noisily, messily. They had been quiet for years, but now they wanted water and air. In Allan\u2019s company, I seemed to spend increasing amounts of time feeling like an idiot. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be difficult  \u2014   \u2014   \u201d He suddenly sounded kind. \u201cI don\u2019t think you are,\u201d he said. \u201cBut deep down, people often know when something is coming. When something has to change. \u201d The last time I spoke to Allan was on the phone I had work I couldn\u2019t get out of. He was as unrepentantly to the point as ever. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said as I apologized. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. But I wanted to say, if your   comes back, think seriously. Good luck. And don\u2019t forget to fill in the feedback form. \u201d Later that day, from across my office desk, my phone pinged. It was a message from my ex: \u201cDo you want to meet up? I\u2019d like to speak to you. \u201d How had Allan foreseen that? The old love drew me back in, even when reduced to digital form. \u201cWhen?\u201d I replied. \u201cWhere do you want to meet up?\u201d A few days later, after an evening of stilted small talk in a pub, we stood together on a London street streaming with people. It was a sharp, clear November night. I felt blindsided. Ten minutes earlier he had stared cryptically into my face and said: \u201cI think we should try again. I miss you. \u201d Words I had been willing him to say. \u201cI understand this is a surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you to decide. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d I mumbled. But then there was the beach. I had found that the more time I spent imagining that beach, the better I felt, the more I noticed things. That afternoon, for example, I had enjoyed how the cold air smelled of bonfires. Even now, flooded with fear, I had briefly thought how cheerful the city\u2019s scarlet buses looked as they slid past in the dark. I could see him waiting for a response, but I stood dumb. The traffic roared and I could feel my feet vibrating with the pavement. Cold wind brushed past, goading me. It was all in league with a new, internal voice, one that spoke quietly and unexpectedly. \u201cLeave him,\u201d it said. \u201cTake what you have and run. \u201d So with hardly a word, I turned and ran for the bus. That was a couple of years ago. Allan gave me no cure for heartbreak, but he did teach me some things. To look after my body, to pay it respect. To question my mind, which doesn\u2019t understand half as much as it thinks it does. To understand that the time spent in the gap between the endless stories we tell ourselves is the present. These days, I care more about being peaceful and happy than about being in love. I\u2019m not sure love is love if it consumes you, if it dominates your thoughts. Perhaps that\u2019s something else: obsession, limerence. While it\u2019s a trip to get lost in a relationship, finding yourself again can prove   and costly. But breathing freely, feeling alert to the world and being in touch with your emotions? Just $2. 99 at the app store. And a lot of work. Next I\u2019d like to try having love and happiness at the same time, though. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s possible.'"}, "time": 1742563179.8729646}
