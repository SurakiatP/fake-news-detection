Guys, we got one! pic.twitter.com/2hZUVxyP8K \\n\u2014 Black Women 4 Trump (@TallahForTrump) October 28, 2016 \\nThe pictures showed the row of downed Trump signs as well as a closeup of the specially designed trap on the first sign in the line.   \\nThe final picture was of the likely suspects pulled over a short distance away, car jacked up for a tire change. \\nThis is probably not the wisest thing an American voter could do to show support for Donald Trump, but it\u2019s hard to argue that the woman who chose to drive over the signs in an effort to destroy them didn\u2019t get exactly what she deserved. \\nHopefully this will teach a valuable lesson to this woman and other Trump haters out there that other people\u2019s property is best left alone.'"}, "time": 1742563577.4053226}
