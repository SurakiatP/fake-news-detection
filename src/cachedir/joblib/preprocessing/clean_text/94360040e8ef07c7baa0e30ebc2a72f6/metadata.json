A gathering of Japanese researchers from the University of Tokyo, under the supervision of Mio Watanabe, directed a series of examinations by which they figured out how to outwardly catch the energy of a man. With the help of profoundly sensitive cameras, the researchers could photo a person\u2019s unique aura. It has been found that the \u201csparkle\u201d is brightest in the morning and appears to \"blur\" at night. It is most obvious around the face, mouth, cheeks and neck. Do We All Have An Aura of Energy? \\nSpecialists trust that this procedure could turn into a system for use in the determination and treatment of numerous ailments. A \u201cblackout\u201d gleam around certain body parts may demonstrate the beginning of a sickness or other health-related problem. \\nTo enhance our understanding of this undetected world of energy, there are certain scientific experiments that are being carried out using a technique called bioelectrophotography. The currently proposed idea is that every one of us is constantly emitting energy, and bio electrophotography are going to help us capture these energy fields. These energy fields will show up as the light around the body, also known as your \u201caura\u201d . \\nThere have been studies done at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) Laboratory which suggest that our minds may have the ability to influence the certain output of devices, or Random Event Generators (REGs). These studies give us insight into something that many people don\u2019t even know, or believe, is there. \\nThis research also explains why \u201chealers\u201d claim to have the ability to see the aura of individuals. A study led in Spain has indicated some these healers show a neuropsychological quirk known as \"synesthesia\", giving an important clarification of their abilities. Essentially, synesthesia is a neurological condition in which one cognitive pattern leads to another cognitive example. \\n\u201c[They] have abilities and attitudes that make them believe in their ability to heal other people, but it is actually a case of self-deception, as synesthesia is not an extrasensory power, but a subjective and \u2018adorned\u2019 perception of reality\u201d. - University of Granada \\nThis article (Mind over matter: Unseen world of energy now uncovered with Bioelectrophotography) is free and open source.
