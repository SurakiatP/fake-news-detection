S.  border wall quickly. [\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d said one woman whose brother was killed by an illegal alien. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal. I\u2019m so happy, so happy, and excited and can\u2019t wait for him to become our president tomorrow. \u201d  Asked by Breitbart News\u2019 Washington political editor Matt Boyle what she wants to see done on Day One of Trump\u2019s presidency, she said: \u201cBuild that wall! Build that wall, stop illegal immigration. Keep American families from being killed by illegal immigrants. \u201d Dan Golvach, whose son, Spencer, was killed by a   illegal alien, told Trump to stick to his guns. \u201cKeep being yourself,\u201d Golvach said. \u201cNo other candidates that were in this race reached out to us. He did. He treated us like family. He knows us by name. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen him when the cameras aren\u2019t on,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd he\u2019s sincere. He\u2019s a great man. Full of energy. And I think that if anybody can turn this country around, the way it needs to be, it\u2019s Donald Trump. \u201d WATCH: Agnes Gibboney, a legal immigrant whose son Ronald da Silva was murdered in 2002 by an illegal alien, said Trump\u2019s promises to enforce immigration meant a great deal. \u201cIt means a lot. Not only to me, so I wouldn\u2019t lose another loved one, but to everybody in this country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to secure our borders, enforce our laws. We need to do what\u2019s right. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561755.8359835}
