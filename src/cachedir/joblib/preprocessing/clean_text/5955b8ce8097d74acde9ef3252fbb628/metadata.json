Iranian officials had been showing caution since Mr. Trump took office last month. Despite expressing anger at his policies and comments, even   have taken care not to provoke the new American president. But on Tuesday, it became seemingly apparent to Iran\u2019s leaders that Mr. Trump is not easily ignored. After Ayatollah Khamenei spoke out sarcastically about Mr. Trump, others expressed worries. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in an interview with a local newspaper that he expected \u201cdifficult times ahead\u201d for Iran, now that Mr. Trump was in charge. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, defended the nuclear agreement between his country and six world powers, including the United States, by saying that the deal was \u201c \u201d for all. But Mr. Trump  \u2014   who has described the nuclear agreement as \u201creally, really bad\u201d but has not made any moves to alter it  \u2014   disparaged Iran again on Twitter, this time in a defense against criticism that he is too close to Russia and its leader, President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Trump wondered how President Barack Obama could have made a nuclear agreement with Iran, a country Mr. Trump described as \u201c#1 in terror. \u201d Mr. Trump seemed to be summarizing comments by his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, who on Sunday called Iran the \u201cbiggest sponsor of state terrorism. \u201d Many Iranians have expressed astonishment and ridicule at such assertions, pointing to terrorist groups that despise Iran and the West. First Al Qaeda, responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and more recently the Islamic State, which has been killing thousands in the Middle East and is responsible for committing and inspiring attacks in Europe and the United States. \u201cTrump is trying to corner Iran, to make us bow before the U. S. and change our behavior, or face confrontation,\u201d said Nader Karimi Joni, a political activist close to Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government. Mr. Trump included Iran on  a list of seven predominantly Muslim countries whose citizens have been barred from entering the United States under an executive order that has been blocked, for now, in the American court system. Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, warned Tehran last week that it had been put \u201con notice\u201d after an Iranian missile test. Washington imposed new economic sanctions on 25 people and entities after the missile launch, which Mr. Flynn said had violated a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution approved after the United States and other world powers reached an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program. Iran has asserted that its missile tests do not violate that resolution and fall within its rights to  . In another possible move against Iran, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers are debating an order intended to designate its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, according to current and former officials in the United States briefed on the deliberations. For Ayatollah Khamenei, Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent appears to have vindicated many suspicions harbored by the Iranian leader, who has said many times that the United States cannot be trusted. \u201cHe has proven what we have been saying for more than 30 years  \u2014   we would always speak about the political, economic, moral and social corruption in the U. S. administration  \u2014   this man revealed it during the election campaign and since then,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to a translated text of the speech. Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Iran\u2019s leaders, said Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cthreatening and ranting\u201d style reflected a miscalculation of Iran\u2019s power. \u201cHe will soon realize Iran will not be intimidated,\u201d Mr. Taraghi said. The history of animosity between both countries is long and deep. Several American administrations, including Mr. Obama\u2019s, have argued for years that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, because of its support for the Lebanese Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which the United States regards as terrorist organizations. Iran has also been held responsible by the United States for several terror attacks, most decades ago. One of them, of course, was the seizure of 54 members of the American Embassy staff in Tehran for 444 days during the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Iran also has been accused of involvement in a 1983 bomb attack at a Marines barracks in Lebanon, where 241 service personnel died. In 2003, a federal judge ruled that Hezbollah carried out the attack at the behest of Iran. Several judges have ordered Iran to pay billions of dollars in damages. Iran denies the accusations. Iran has pressed several claims against the United States. Iran holds the United States responsible for having supported Saddam Hussein with intelligence, funds and weapons after he attacked Iran in 1980, dragging both countries into a   war where thousands of Iranians and Iraqis died. In 1988, an American naval vessel, the Vincennes, shot down an Iran Air commercial plane, flying over the Persian Gulf to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. All 290 people aboard died. Iran called the attack deliberate and the United States called it a mistake. Under a settlement at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the United States offered no apologies and was ordered to pay around $60 million in damages to families of the victims. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides apparently view Iran and its clerical leaders as a leading source of evil. During his inaugural speech, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201cunite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth. \u201d At the time, many thought he meant the Islamic State, but in books and speeches both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Mattis said Iran was radically Islamic and described the country as the biggest threat to peace in the Middle East. In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said: \u201cIran is playing with fire  \u2014   they don\u2019t appreciate how \u2018kind\u2019 President Obama was to them. Not me!\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s Friday posting in biting fashion with his own remarks on Twitter. \u201cIran should\u2019ve appreciated Obama!\u201d he wrote, adding, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State: \u201cHow come? Appreciate him for #DAESH, war in Iraq Syria or public support for 2009 unrest?\u201d In a   post, he said that Iranians would hold a rally on Friday, the 38th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, to show \u201ctheir position toward threats. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563715.6073437}
