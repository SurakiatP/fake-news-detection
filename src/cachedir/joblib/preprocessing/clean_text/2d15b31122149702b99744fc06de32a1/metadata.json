[Legendary college basketball coaches Mike Krzyzewski of Duke and Roy Williams of North Carolina teach their players about basketball and offer life lessons too \u2014  like on correct bathroom usage. The two voiced their disdain for the state of North Carolina\u2019s  law that requires people use the bathroom that corresponds to their biological gender in government buildings and   universities.  The law reads, \u201cPublic agencies [and local boards of education] shall require every multiple occupancy bathroom or changing facility to be designated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex. \u201d As a result of the Tar Heel state\u2019s legislation, the NCAA pulled the University of North Carolina as a venue for the popular March Madness tournament for 2017. Coach Williams explained to USA Today his contempt for the law and the state\u2019s unwillingness to repeal it, saying, \u201cI\u2019m very sad, very disappointed about the whole thing, which apparently is something that\u2019s really, really hard to change. \u201d Coach K preached his words of wisdom on March Bathroom Madness while criticizing his home state and complimenting NCAA replacement venue, Greenville, South Carolina. \u201cThey have the right to host it whether our state is smart enough to have it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a contest of one against another. \u201cIt would be nice if our state got as smart and also would host not just basketball tournaments but concerts and other NCAA events. But maybe we\u2019ll get there in the next century, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see. \u201cLook, it\u2019s a stupid thing. That\u2019s my political statement. If I was president or governor I\u2019d get rid of it. And I\u2019d back up my promises. As unusual as that might be. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to get too political. \u201d South Carolina knows well the ramifications of the NCAA\u2019s political agenda. For fourteen years the home state of Fort Sumpter, where soldiers fired the first shots of the Civil War, were denied hosting the premier NCAA basketball tournament for flying the Confederate flag on the capitol grounds. In July 2015   Nicky Halley ordered the flag removed. '"}, "time": 1742562879.4970722}
