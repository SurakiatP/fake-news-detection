Michael Flynn to resign in response to an \u201cerosion\u201d of trust between the two. [\u201cThe issue pure and simple came down to a matter of trust and the president concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security adviser,\u201d Spicer said during the White House press conference on Tuesday. He also revealed that there was \u201ca series of other questionable instances\u201d that also contributed to the erosion of the president\u2019s trust.  Spicer said that Trump was \u201cconcerned\u201d about Flynn after it was clear that he had misled the Vice President about phone conversations with his Russian counterparts about sanctions. After the Justice Department notified the White House counsel that they had evidence Flynn was not telling the truth, Spicer confirmed that they investigated the legal ramifications of his actions. Spicer revealed that the Justice Department didn\u2019t notify the administration about their knowledge of the calls until January 26, nineteen days ago.  Spicer added that Flynn\u2019s actions were not illegal, as determined by the White House counsel, but it created what he called an \u201cunsustainable situation. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why the president decided to ask for his resignation, and he got it,\u201d Spicer added.'"}, "time": 1742562839.2936938}
