But not anymore. Since Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in November, consumer sentiment has diverged in an unprecedented way, with Republicans convinced that a boom is at hand, and Democrats foreseeing an imminent recession. \u201cWe\u2019ve never recorded this before,\u201d said Richard Curtin, who directs the University of Michigan\u2019s monthly survey of consumer sentiment. Although the outlook has occasionally varied by political party since the survey began in 1946, \u201cthe partisan divide has never had as large an impact on consumers\u2019 economic expectations,\u201d he said. At the same time, familiar economic data points have become Rorschach tests. That was evident after the government\u2019s monthly jobs report on Friday Republicans\u2019 talking points centered on a   low in the unemployment rate, while Democrats focused on a sharp decline in job creation. \u201cI find it stunning, to be honest. It\u2019s unreal,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington. \u201cThings that were less politicized in the past, like how you feel about the economy, have become more politicized now. \u201d Indeed, the    views underscore yet another front on which Americans remain polarized five months after the election, and with President Trump nearing his 100th day in office. There are some tangible reasons for the split. Many Republican states, including the Midwestern swing states that provided Mr. Trump\u2019s margin of victory, have experienced a more sluggish recovery over the last eight years  \u2014   and are thus more invested in the change promised by Mr. Trump. Many Democratic states have bounced back more vigorously. Hence their political and economic viewpoints were jolted by November\u2019s election result. For example, Vermont, Colorado and Massachusetts  \u2014   all carried by the Democrats  \u2014   are thriving, with an unemployment rate below 4 percent. In Republican strongholds like Alaska, Georgia and Alabama, the rate is well above the national average of 4. 5 percent.    Republicans aren\u2019t the only ones who are feeling more upbeat, whether or not it\u2019s justified by the data. Sentiment among business leaders who backed Mr. Trump has also surged since the election. David Congdon, chief executive of Old Dominion Freight Line, the trucking giant, never expected Mr. Trump to win when he voted for him in November. \u201cI fell out of bed when I got up in the morning on Nov. 9,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite know what I was voting for. \u201d But despite misfires in Washington like the failed attempt to roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s health care policies, Mr. Congdon is definitely feeling more positive. \u201cTrump\u2019s got a hard road ahead of him, but I think he\u2019s off to a decent start,\u201d said Mr. Congdon, who recently joined other transportation executives for a meeting with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. \u201cI\u2019m personally optimistic about the economy for the rest of the year, and I think we will see an uptick in terms of freight deliveries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have picked up our hiring. \u201d Economists, too, find their outlook shifting with the political landscape. Before the election, Heather Boushey, a top adviser to Hillary Clinton during the campaign, thought \u201cthe economy was on the right track, with slow and steady growth like we\u2019ve had over the past few years. \u201d Now she is much more pessimistic, especially about the economy\u2019s   prospects. Although she is pleased that the Affordable Care Act survived Republican efforts to repeal it, the gridlock has led her to believe that Mr. Trump will never get a big infrastructure spending package through Congress. \u201cI am losing hope that we will make those   investments over the next few years,\u201d said Ms. Boushey, executive director of the liberal Center for Equitable Growth. The University of Michigan researchers have their own way of measuring the gulf between the two viewpoints and how quickly it has flipped. Among Republicans, the Michigan consumer expectations index was at 61. 1 in October, the kind of reading typically reported in the depths of a recession. Confident that Mrs. Clinton would win, Democrats registered a 95. 4 reading, close to the highs reached when her husband was in office in the late 1990s and the economy was soaring. By March, the positions were reversed, with an even more extreme split. Republicans\u2019 expectations had soared to 122. 5, equivalent to levels registered in boom times. As for Democrats, they were even more pessimistic than Republicans had been in October. As at the voting booth, the split in perceptions could have   consequences. If behavior tracks the   sentiment among Democrats, who account for 32 percent of respondents in the survey, prophecies could quickly become   by affecting spending and investing decisions. \u201cIf   of the population cut their consumer spending by 5 percent, you get a recession,\u201d said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist who served in the Clinton administration and advised Al Gore and Hillary Clinton on economic policy during their Democratic presidential campaigns. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen, but it\u2019s not beyond the realm of the possible. \u201d To be sure, even if Democratic consumers pulled back, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily bring on a recession. A burst of spending by bullish Republicans, who equal 27 percent of those polled by the Michigan researchers, could counteract much of that drag. And independents, who are the largest cohort in the survey, at 41 percent, remain fairly optimistic about future growth. It is rare for \u201crising optimism to coexist with increasing uncertainty,\u201d said Mr. Curtin, the Michigan expert. \u201cThe current level of optimism clearly indicates that no economywide spending retrenchment is underway, but the prevailing level of uncertainty will limit growth in discretionary spending. \u201d Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and was Mr. Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser during his first term, said he, too, was struck by the big swing in economic sentiment. \u201cIt is a remarkably big switch from October,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are a Democrat, you are primed for negativity. It carries through in your view of everything else. \u201d A prominent Democrat himself and a strong Hillary Clinton backer, Mr. Summers is nonetheless slightly more optimistic than he was late last year, because the data on housing starts and business investment intentions has been positive, not because of the new administration\u2019s policies. Whether the optimists or pessimists prove more prescient about the economy\u2019s trajectory, Mr. Summers said, the split in perceptions will persist. \u201cI\u2019d bet there will be some minor convergence,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there will still be a large divergence on what should be a matter of objective reality. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563104.9691317}
