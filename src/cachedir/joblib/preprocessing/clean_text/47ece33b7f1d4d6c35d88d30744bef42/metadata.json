Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 The Trump administration detailed plans to deport millions of immigrants, releasing expansive new rules that allow rapid deportations and the expulsion of undocumented immigrants who have committed even minor offenses. Here\u2019s how deportation works. The shift in enforcement faces resistance from many states and dozens of   sanctuary cities. The new rules will be high on the agenda as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the head of Homeland Security, John Kelly, visit Mexico this week. _____ \u2022 Mr. Trump spoke out for the first time about a rising trend of incidents and threats targeting Jews and Jewish institutions, saying that   is \u201chorrible,\u201d and \u201cpainful. \u201d He commented during a visit to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, calling the venue \u201ca meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms. \u201d A riot in an immigrant neighborhood in Sweden came two days after Mr. Trump baffled that country with claims  \u2014   based on a Fox News feature  \u2014   that it had seen a surge in crime and violence linked to refugees. _____ \u2022 China\u2019s suspension of coal imports from North Korea is seen as punishment for the North\u2019s weapons programs, but it may also add pressure on the U. S. to hold talks with the country. A North Korean government delegation has plans to meet in New York in early March with former U. S. officials involved in North Korea policy. Beijing also voiced its opposition to patrols by a U. S. aircraft carrier strike group in the South China Sea. _____ \u2022 The bodies of 74 migrants washed up on the coast of Libya, an ominous opening of the high season for sea crossings to Europe. \u201cIf they are starting strong like this, it means we could see a lot of deaths this year,\u201d an aid official said. _____ \u2022 And an   panda, Bao Bao, boarded a     flight to China, which retains rights to cubs born of its loaned pandas.

How the   got their money and what they do with it are matters of global importance. \u2022 Yahoo and Verizon slashed $350 million from the price that Verizon would pay to buy Yahoo\u2019s core internet businesses.

He travels to China next month and hosts Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India this summer. [Jerusalem Post] \u2022 The pilot of a plane that crashed into a Melbourne shopping center, killing himself and four passengers, was under investigation for a \u201cnear collision\u201d with another plane in 2015. [Sydney Morning Herald] \u2022 China\u2019s internet users have flocked to a viral video of a fierce scuffle between two groups of takeout deliverymen, which shows how intense the field\u2019s turf wars can be. [Caixin] \u2022 Milo Yiannopoulos, who has been testing the limits of provocative language in the U. S. lost a book contract, a conservative platform and his job after the publication of a video in which he condones sexual relations with boys as young as 13.

[The Asahi Shimbun] \u2022 \u201cPorcelain bumping\u201d is a common swindle in China: pedestrians faking injuries to extort motorists. But in an age of   cameras, it\u2019s getting a lot harder to pull off. [The New York Times] \u2022 Is your morning granola actually healthy?

When the sun rises over Abu Simbel in Egypt this morning, rays of light will reach a temple\u2019s dark inner sanctum and shine on statues of gods and of Pharaoh Ramses II, who commissioned the temple\u2019s construction. That phenomenon, which must have struck the pharaoh\u2019s subjects with awe, occurs only twice each year. According to legend, the temple was designed that way to honor the days of the ancient ruler\u2019s coronation and his birthday with sunlight. But if the legend\u2019s true, then the light has been arriving a day late for several decades. In the 1960s, the    temple was moved inland to save it from rising water levels caused by the Aswan Dam. More than a thousand blocks of stone were meticulously cut and transported to its current location. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose a single baboon,\u201d an engineer working on the project told The Times then. He was referring to the scores of carved baboons at the temple\u2019s entrance, which are shown barking at the rising sun. The move pushed back, by a day, the arrival of sunlight to the inner sanctum. It now happens on Feb. 22 and Oct. 22. The mummy of Ramses II has also narrowly avoided obliteration in recent decades. In 1974, it was flown to Paris where scientists attempted to slow its deterioration. Egypt issued the mummy a passport on that occasion, its profession listed as: \u201cKing (deceased). \u201d Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.
