Radical leftists are calling for thousands upon thousands of activists to descend upon Washington D.C. on Inauguration Day, and they are planning to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as they possibly can. And if you doubt that the \u201cNot My President\u201d movement can pull this off, you may want to consider that 25,000 protesters showed up in New York City on Saturday on very short notice. These people are bitter, angry, frustrated and incredibly motivated. At this point they still have more than two months to organize their forces, and many are expecting that this is going to be the most chaotic Inauguration Day in American history. \\nOne of the Facebook pages that is attempting to recruit protesters for Inauguration Day is entitled \u201cProtest at the Inauguration: Stand Against Trump, War, Racism and Inequality\u201d. So far, 7,800   that they will be attending on this page alone, and another 26,000 have expressed interest in the protest. The organizers of this particular page are very clear about why they believe that the inauguration of Donald Trump must be protested \u2026 \\nDonald Trump is a racist, sexist bigot. We believe that tens of thousands of progressive people will be in the streets on Inauguration Day and in the weeks and months afterward. \\nHow one voted on election day is one thing, but even more important is whether we succeed in building a mass movement that can truly change the country, and the world. \\nWaiting for the same politicians who led to the rise of Trump to now stop him is a lost cause. \\nOn Facebook and Twitter, the hashtag #DisruptJ20 is already generating an immense amount of buzz. This movement appears to be very well funded, and they have already produced some very slick videos promoting the upcoming inauguration protest. #DisruptJ20 : Call for a bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald #Trump on January 20, 2017 pic.twitter.com/EGU65bOtNG \\n\u2014 stimulator (@stimulator) November 11, 2016 \\n#DisruptJ20 even has an official website now, and they are openly calling for a national strike on January 20th in addition to the chaos that they plan to cause in Washington\u2026 \\nOn January 20th, the day of the Presidential Inauguration, protesters will rally to interrupt Trump\u2019s coronation. You can help organize, and you can attend the march . You can also heed calls to strike , wherever you are in the country. \\nOn January 21st, millions of women will converge on Washington DC specifically to oppose the Trump administration\u2019s promised attack on women\u2019s rights and freedoms. Join them. \\nAnd on the #DisruptJ20 Facebook page , the organizers are very open about the fact that they plan to bitterly fight against Donald Trump every step of the way\u2026 \\nOn Friday, January 20, 2017, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as   call on all people of good conscience to join in disrupting the ceremonies. If Trump is to be inaugurated at all, let it happen behind closed doors, showing the true face of the security state Trump will preside over. It must be made clear to the whole world that the vast majority of people in the United States do not support his presidency or consent to his rule. \\nTrump stands for tyranny, greed, and misogyny. He is the champion of neo-nazis and white Nationalists, of the police who kil l the Black, Brown and poor on a daily basis, of racist border agents and sadistic prison guards, of the FBI and NSA who tap your phone and read your email. He is the harbinger of even more climate catastrophe, deportation, discrimination, and endless war. He continues to deny the existence of climate change, in spite of all the evidence, putting the future of the whole human race at stake. The KKK, Vladimir Putin, Golden Dawn, and the Islamic State all cheered his victory. If we let his inauguration go unchallenged, we are opening the door to the future they envision. \\nTrump\u2019s success confirms the bankruptcy of representative democracy. Rather than using the democratic process as an alibi for inaction, we must show that no election could legitimize his agenda. Neither the Democrats nor any other political party or politician will save us\u2014they just offer a weaker version of the same thing. If there is going to be positive change in this society, we have to make it ourselves, together, through direct action. \\nFrom day one, the Trump presidency will be a disaster. #DisruptJ20 will be the start of the resistance. We must take to the streets and protest, blockade, disrupt, intervene, sit in, walk out, rise up, and make more noise and good trouble than the establishment can bear. The parade must be stopped. We must delegitimize Trump and all he represents. It\u2019s time to defend ourselves, our loved ones, and the world that sustains us as if our lives depend on it\u2014because they do. \\nSome have noted that 2017 will be the 100 year anniversary of the communist revolution in Russia, and many on the radical left are now openly using the word \u201crevolution\u201d to describe what they would like to see here in the United States. \\nAnd this call to protest Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration appears to have originated with a Marxist politician out in Seattle \u2026 \\nA self-avowed Marxist member of the Seattle City Council who is part of the George Soros-funded Occupy Wall Street movement has called for a \u201cmassive protest\u201d   Trump and a \u201cnationwide shut down\u201d on Inauguration Day. \\nKshama Sawant went on an anti-Trump rant following the election that stirred up progressives\u2019 emotions against Trump voters, calling them part of \u201ca racist agenda.\u201d \\nSawant held a press conference calling for a mass protest in Seattle. That protest was attended by students, members of Seattle\u2019s LGBTQ community, as well as Occupy members and Muslims. \\nMany had been hoping that the nationwide protests against Donald Trump would be quieting down by now, but that does not appear to be happening. Instead, they just seem to keep getting more intense. Just check out what took place around the country on Saturday \u2026 \\nSeventy-one people were arrested in Portland, Oregon, where crowds threw burning road flares at officers. \\nHundreds gathered outside City Hall in Los Angeles to face off against riot police after a daytime march with drew 8,000 people. \\nOther rallies took place in Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Washington DC, and Phoenix, as the anti-Trump backlash continued to grow. \\nIn Indianapolis, crowds chanted \u2018kill the police\u2019 as they threw rocks at officers in a separate protest. \\nAt other times, Barack Obama has stepped in and condemned protests when they have gotten violent. \\nSo why is he just sitting back and saying nothing now? \\nAs the president of the United States, shouldn\u2019t he be trying to calm everyone down? \\nIt is easy to see how the \u201cNot My President\u201d movement could continue to grow and reach a crescendo on January 20th, 2017. \\nNormally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and gladness for the nation, but this time around we may see unprecedented scenes of chaos, rioting and violence. \\nAt this point, there appears to be no possible way that the entire nation is going to unite behind President Trump, and many are wondering if we are now entering four years of the worst civil unrest that the United States has ever experienced.

Could it be he was actually working behind the scenes to protect and help set up these organizations during his entire presidency? Seems obvious that with the speed and organization with which they have begun marching in the streets since Wednesday the organizations were in place well before the election was held, yes? Almost as if someone deliberately wanted Trump to win to begin the riots acoss the nation! A.S. \\nEvery person involved with those riots should be put in prison for life! They are vermin, cockroaches, evil people. I didn\u2019t see republicans or conservatives protesting Obama like this after both of his election wins. I hope this country turns around soon. lg \\nGod raises up leaders as he wishes. Apparently, there was a supernatural force behind Mr. Trump victory. At the time when he was prayed for by leading evengalicals God almighty put His hand on him. His saw the humidity in his heart. No matter what the enemy is throwing at him no harm shall come near him. With all the hate that has originated from the west coast toward Mr. Trump has not gone unnoticed by God. I believe a day of reckening will soon scent on the west coast. Brace yourself America. Keep Mr. Trump in your prayers. \\ntheir dustructive divisive agenda'"}, "time": 1742564464.0280774}
