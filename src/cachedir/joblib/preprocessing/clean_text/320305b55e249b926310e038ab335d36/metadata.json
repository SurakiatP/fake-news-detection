We did our best, people just don\u2019t seem to be interested. There\u2019ll be a big crying match when rich people go on safari in Kenya in 2065 and there\u2019s nothing but trees and like, two crows, but it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t fucking warn them, y\u2019know?\u201d \\nFollowing the change of wildlife to wilddeath, it was also announced that Mankind would be renamed Manpricks.'"}, "time": 1742628439.6022232}
