It\u2019s a notice from my privatized water company threatening a water shut-off in 3 days unless I allow them to change my analog water meter (works just fine). \\nAt first I thought it was because I owed them money on a past -due water bills so I called this global corporation up, who incidentally is owned by get this, RWE based in Germany, and who, incidentally controls 70% of Amerika\u2019s municipal water supplies. Don\u2019t believe me CHECK IT OUT! \\nI\u2019m talking about American water, INc here\u2013a facist/globalist/statist outfit if ever one existed. Hey Donald, can we shut these bastards down and let WE THE PEOPLE have our own water? Please. Pretty Please! \\nOf course, our grand-parents and great grand parents never lived under this globalist hell, but I digress. \\nI phoned this water co. up and I was informed by one of their know-nothings that I had to comply with the alleged PUC directive to allow them into my home or my water would be shut off until I agreed to allow them into my home. Does the word EXTORTION still have meaning \\nAnyway, aside from being bilked 10 cents a gallon for what amounts to municipal waste water ( some families pay $4,000 a year for water here), \\nI am faced with a dilemma! Do I allow some idiot techs to install their dangerous new smart water meter or should I follow the instructions in this youtube video? \\nI await your sound advice, whomever you are reading this. \\nJ \\nall rights reserved under the Constitution for the United States of America 1789 Share this:'"}, "time": 1742564111.444839}
