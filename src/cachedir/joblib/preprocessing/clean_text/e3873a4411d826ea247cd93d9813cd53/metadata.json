[Salvo Riina, who was released from prison in 2011 but prohibited from returning to Sicily, obtained special permission from the court to attend his niece\u2019s baptism in his native town of Corleone, and furthermore convinced a Catholic priest in Padua to issue a declaration that Riina is a practicing Catholic in good standing and therefore a suitable godfather for the child.  On learning of the gangster\u2019s role in the baptism, the bishop of Monreale, Michele Pennisi, stated Wednesday: \u201cNeither I, nor the offices of the Curia were informed. Allowing the son of Riina to be the baptismal godfather was an imprudent and reprehensible choice, which I do not approve. \u201d The baptism was performed last December 29, but the circumstances only recently came to the attention of Bishop Pennisi, who is one of Sicily\u2019s most vocal critics of Cosa Nostra, the local branch of the Italian Mafia. Salvatore \u201cTot\u00f2\u201d Riina ruled over Cosa Nostra from the early 1980s through the dramatic period of the early 90s, when he notoriously ordered the assassination of two antimafia prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. He was eventually arrested in 1993 and is serving several life sentences in an Italian   prison. Riina\u2019s youngest son Giuseppe Salvatore (\u201cSalvo\u201d) reportedly killed his first victim before he turned 20, and was later arrested in 2002 and sentenced two years later for crimes of Mafia association, extortion,   and money laundering. Salvo Riina was released in 2011, but the district   prosecutor of Palermo forbade Riina from returning to Sicily, saying he had never interrupted his relations with Cosa Nostra. Since then, Riina has lived in the norther Italian city of Padua. The bishop of Monreale said he understood why the local priest accepted Riina as godfather for the baptism, since he had presented a valid certificate from his local pastor, \u201cstill, I will not change my mind about what happened,\u201d he said. Bishop Pennisi recalled that the godfather \u201cmust be the guarantor of the faith and must give witness with his actions. \u201d \u201cAnd I am not aware that the young man has ever expressed words of repentance for his conduct,\u201d he said. Bishop Pennisi has announced that soon he will carry out a pastoral visit to Corleone. \u201cWe need clear words about the mafia,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain episodes are no longer tolerable. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
