I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.\u201d\\n\u201cGod forbid we put someone like that in the White House,\u201d he added, referring to Hillary.\\nKallstrom, a who was assistant Director of the FBI in charge of the New York office during the 1990s, knows all about crime families, having tracked down mobsters, and swindlers for years.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money.\u201d Kallstrom said.\\nThe former FBI official, perhaps most well known for his criminal inquiry into the downing of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, said of Hillary \u201cshe\u2019s a pathological liar, and she\u2019s always been a liar.\u201d\\nReferring specifically to the FBI investigation into her email server, Kallstrom said \u201cThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation.\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I\u2019m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.\u201d he added, referring to the Attorney General.\\n\u201cSo this investigation was without the ability to serve subpoenas, serve search warrants, and obtain the evidence that they ended up begging for. It was just ludicrous what went on.\u201d Kallstrom added, noting that theFBI \u201cleft so much stuff on the table\u201d.\\nKallstrom also noted that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the top brass at the bureau were directly responsible for holding back the investigation.\\n\u201cThe agents are furious with what\u2019s going on, I know that for a fact,\u201d he said.\\nOn Friday Kallstrom stated that he thinks \u201csomething big is going to happen\u201d in the coming days, and that Comey \u201ccouldn\u2019t hold onto it any longer\u201d and had to reopen the investigation because had he not, \u201cthe locals would have stepped in,\u201d meaning the regular FBI agents who have seen the bombshell evidence against Clinton.\\nThe full interview can be viewed here .\\nThe Washington Post also reported Monday that regular FBI agents have been pushing hard for the Clinton Foundation to be investigated over claims it gave favors and special access to donors.\\nThe report notes that it was the Justice Department that shut down the line of inquiry into the foundation.\\n\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742628576.0944839}
