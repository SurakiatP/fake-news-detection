Especially as I already have a horrendously prejudiced grandparent. \\n\u201cStop saying I could do better. You might think so, but by any realistic measure she\u2019s already way out of my league, okay?\u201d \\nFollowing the letter, newspapers agreed that what would be lovely is getting out the family album to show this new girl photos of Harry dressed as a Nazi. \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742561627.612135}
