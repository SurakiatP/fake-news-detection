Two days before Tuesday\u2019s primaries in California and five other states, Mr. Sanders repeated his pledge not to concede even if Mrs. Clinton acquires enough delegates to reach 2, 383, the threshold for securing the nomination. A win in California is critical to Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan to stay in the race through the convention and would give him a significant lift. But with her victory in the Puerto Rico primary on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton is only 28 delegates short of the threshold and will most likely declare victory on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders, however, insists that the convention will be contested because he is still lobbying superdelegates  \u2014   party officials and state leaders who cast their final votes at the convention  \u2014   to withdraw support from Mrs. Clinton and back him instead. He plans to make the case that he is a stronger candidate against Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. A number of polls, he said, show he can beat Mr. Trump by larger margins than Mrs. Clinton can. On Sunday, Mr. Sanders opened a new line of attack against Mrs. Clinton, criticizing donations made by foreign governments while she was secretary of state to the Clinton Foundation, the organization founded by former President Bill Clinton. When Mr. Sanders, who greeted fans in West Hollywood, was asked by reporters if he remained committed to pushing for a contested convention, he said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d was. A convention is typically seen as contested when a candidate cannot reach the necessary delegate count using both pledged delegates and superdelegates. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton conceded to Barack Obama shortly after the final primary and before the convention. But Mr. Sanders is promising to break with tradition and extend his fight further than initially expected. Mr. Sanders reiterated his stance on Sunday at a restaurant filled with disco lights as he urged supporters to back him. \u201cWe need a real change in this country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said to a cheering crowd at the restaurant, Hamburger Mary\u2019s, in West Hollywood, \u201cand we need a government which represents all of us, not just the 1 percent. \u201d During a news conference on Saturday in Los Angeles, Mr. Sanders said it would be wrong for Mrs. Clinton to claim victory on Tuesday based on her total delegate count. News media outlets should not call the race, he said, unless she reaches the threshold with only pledged delegates. \u201cIt is extremely unlikely that Secretary Clinton will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to claim victory on Tuesday night,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cNow, I have heard reports that Secretary Clinton has said it\u2019s all going to be over on Tuesday night. I have reports that the media, after the New Jersey results come in, are going to declare that it is all over. That simply is not accurate. \u201d Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders in both pledged and total delegates. In a sign of his campaign\u2019s urgency to win in California, Mr. Sanders criticized the Clinton Foundation during an interview on Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union. \u201d \u201cIf you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, governments which are dictatorships?\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of civil liberties or democratic rights in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he told the interviewer, Jake Tapper. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of respect there for opposition points of view for gay rights, for women\u2019s rights. Yes, do I have a problem with that? Yes, I do. \u201d Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton spent Sunday campaigning in California, where polls indicated a tight race. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Clinton visited black churches, appealing to a demographic that had given her important support in past nominating contests. In Oakland, Mrs. Clinton spoke at Greater St. Paul Church. Tailoring her remarks to her audience, she recalled working briefly in Oakland in the 1970s, and she praised the Golden State Warriors, who were set to host Game 2 of the N. B. A. finals. Mrs. Clinton also talked about issues like gentrification and gun violence and told congregants how difficult it was to be president. \u201cI wish it was only about making speeches,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cYou know, just get up there and promise the moon and make all of these rhetorical flourishes. That\u2019d be a lot easier than what the job is. \u201d Mr. Clinton visited First African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Los Angeles, where he took aim at Mr. Trump and addressed criticism that he and his wife were part of the \u201cpolitical establishment. \u201d \u201cThis is not an establishment campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an inclusion campaign. \u201d Mr. Sanders spent much of his day walking around greeting voters in several places, including the Santa Monica Pier, where dozens of fans hugged and snapped photos with him. Some shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s our next president!\u201d But there were signs of opposition from Clinton supporters. One woman shouted, \u201cGet out of the race!\u201d As Mr. Sanders shook hands, he quickly moved past Jenny Swiatowy, 33, who sat next to a fruit arrangement with a sticker showing her support for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cIn the beginning, I thought it was great for him to come out as a new candidate with a new voice and to start bringing out the young new voters,\u201d said Ms. Swiatowy, who works at a record label. \u201cBut it\u2019s time to concede and unite the party. \u201d Mr. Sanders, though, was not bowing to the pressure. \u201cSee you in Philly,\u201d he told one smiling supporter.'"}, "time": 1742562923.4646714}
