Furious at a lecture organized on campus, demonstrators wearing   outfits smashed windows, threw rocks at the police and stormed a building. The speech? The university called it off. Protest has been synonymous with the University of California, Berkeley, from the earliest days of the free speech movement, when students fought to expand political expression on campus beginning in 1964. Those protests would set off student activism movements that roiled campuses across the country throughout the 1960s. Since then, countless demonstrators have flocked to Sproul Plaza each day to have their voices heard on issues from civil rights and apartheid to Israel, tuition costs and more. But now the university is under siege for canceling a speech by the incendiary   writer Milo Yiannopoulos and words like intolerance, long used by the left, are being used by critics to condemn the protests on Wednesday night that ultimately prevented Mr. Yiannopoulos from speaking. Naweed Tahmas, a junior who is a member of the Berkeley College Republicans, the group that invited Mr. Yiannopoulos to campus, said the cancellation had made him more determined to fight for freedom of speech on campus. \u201cI\u2019m tired of getting silenced, as many conservative students are,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we support freedom of speech, we should support all speech including what they consider hate speech. \u201d When the event was canceled, the Republican student group reacted by writing on their Facebook page, \u201cthe Free Speech Movement is dead. \u201d More than 100 faculty members signed a letter opposing the visit by Mr. Yiannopoulos in recent weeks. \u201cWe support robust debate, but we cannot abide by harassment, slander, defamation, and hate speech,\u201d they wrote. On Thursday, heated arguments broke out at Sproul Plaza between students who said Mr. Yiannopoulos  \u2014   a provocateur editor at Breitbart News who is known for his attacks on political correctness and offensive,   writing  \u2014   was too inflammatory to be invited to campus and those who argued that he should have been allowed to speak. The university made it clear they believed the people who resorted to violence on Wednesday night  \u2014   a group, clad in black clothing and carrying sticks  \u2014   had come from outside the campus. The university estimated on Thursday that the rioting had caused around $100, 000 in damage. Whatever the origins of the violent mob, the university was and remains divided over the meaning of free speech at a time of national political tumult. \u201cI think we need to have a serious conversation about protests. This is going to be a big part of our lives for the next four years,\u201d said Kirsten Pickering, a graduate student at the university. She and others described the violence as a \u201cpotential teachable moment. \u201d \u201cWe need to sit down and talk about what is acceptable,\u201d she added. Troy Worden, a   student and a member of the College Republicans, said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d invite Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak on campus again, and Mr. Tahmas added that the Republican student group is a racially diverse group that does not consider Mr. Yiannopoulos to be a white nationalist. Criticism of the decision to cancel the speech came from outside the university as well. On Twitter early on Thursday, President Trump went as far as to threaten withholding federal funds from the university for failing to stop \u201cviolence on people with a different point of view. \u201d Mr. Yiannopoulos has cultivated a sizable following among the     movement with his speaking events, podcast interviews and articles. He travels around California on a tour bus airbrushed with his likeness. Since embarking in September on his speaking tour of American campuses, he has been trailed by protests. But the events have also attracted pockets of   anarchists clad in face masks and spoiling for a fight. Some university organizers withdrew invitations to Mr. Yiannopoulos over security concerns. At the University of California, Davis, on Jan. 13, his speech was canceled as it was set to begin after a tense standoff between protesters and police officers. A week later, on Inauguration Day, a man was shot during protests outside Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s speech at the University of Washington in Seattle. He was to cap his tour this week at Berkeley. In the weeks leading up to the event, campus administrators faced tremendous pressure from student groups and faculty members to cancel it. In a video of himself posted on Facebook after the cancellation on Wednesday night, Mr. Yiannopoulos criticized the \u201chard left, which has become so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years. \u201d \u201cThey simply will not allow any speaker on campus, even somebody as silly and harmless and gay as me to have their voice heard,\u201d he added. One group that has been outspoken in favor of allowing Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak is the veterans of the university\u2019s free speech movement. \u201cI\u2019m really a little fatigued with all of this, \u2018Oh my goodness, cover my ears, someone will say something that will upset me, I can\u2019t tolerate that,\u2019 \u201d said Jack Radey, who was a    activist during the original free speech movement at Berkeley. \u201cThere are racists, sexists, piggery of various kinds who will say really terrible things. And that is part of the world,\u201d Mr. Radey said by telephone from Oregon, where he is retired. \u201cLearn how to fight back. Don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, no. We can\u2019t allow someone to speak because someone might be offended.\u2019 \u201d In a letter to The Daily Californian, Berkeley\u2019s student newspaper, Mr. Radey and other members of the Free Speech Movement Archive board of directors, a grouping of some of the movement\u2019s activists, said Mr. Yiannopoulos was \u201ca bigot who comes to campus spouting vitriol so as to attract attention to himself. \u201d But they said free speech was paramount. \u201cBerkeley\u2019s free speech tradition, won through struggle  \u2014   suspension, arrest, fines, jail time  \u2014   by Free Speech Movement activists is far more important than Yiannopoulos, and it is that tradition\u2019s endurance that concerns us,\u201d they wrote.'"}, "time": 1742562327.4319925}
