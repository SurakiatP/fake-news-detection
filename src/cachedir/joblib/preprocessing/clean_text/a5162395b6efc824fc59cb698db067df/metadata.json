[\u201cThe EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers,\u201d reported the Independent on Friday. \u201cThe US company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay. \u201d  The Independent continued to claim in their report that \u201cFines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 per cent of their global turnover, which in Google\u2019s case could be about $9bn of its 2016 turnover. \u201d \u201cApart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged   practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results,\u201d they explained. \u201cThe regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. \u201d Google has previously been accused of rigging and changing their search results in their favor, most notably during the 2016 U. S. Presidential Election. Autofill suggestions about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s health were censored, despite the popularity in searches, as well as other search suggestions which conveyed negative messages about Clinton, including \u201cCrooked Hillary. \u201d During an investigation, users discovered that every other popular search engine featured these popular search suggestions apart from Google, who were major backers of Clinton\u2019s campaign. Last year, WikiLeaks founder and editor Julian Assange claimed that Google was \u201cdirectly engaged in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign,\u201d Negative search suggestions about other candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz were not similarly censored. In September, Google was also accused of manipulating the search results for \u201cJihad\u201d to promote a post from the Islamic Supreme Council defending Jihad as a \u201cmisunderstood concept,\u201d while in April the search engine announced that they would be further manipulating results to combat \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201chate speech. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
