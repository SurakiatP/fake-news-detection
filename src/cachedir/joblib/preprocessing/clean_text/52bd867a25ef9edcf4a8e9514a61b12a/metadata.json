They have been together for decades, and while the truth has trickled out, technology has opened the floodgates. Enter Anonymous. The hard-to-define hacking group is doubted by many though they often get things exactly right. Their ideas about Huma Abedin, Hillary\u2019s top assistant, have enough merit to be worth a look, though what you see may frighten you. Allegedly, Huma has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, as her mother is a member of the Brotherhood\u2019s female counterpart. No question, she is tied to Saudi Arabia, as she was raised there. She was born in the United States, and at age two, her family moved to Saudi. Huma returned at age 18, then started her intern career with Hillary Clinton at the age of twenty. She worked for her mother\u2019s magazine, a Jihadist publication that promotes Sharia law. The Muslim World League funds the Abedin family business, and they also funded al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. Who is Human Abedin, in truth? The video below from Anonymous reveals more: \\nWith news of Huma\u2019s estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, dominating the news recently, much is being presented in the news media on Weiner and Abedin\u2019s connection to Hillary Clinton, with the ongoing FBI investigation being primary. \\nAs you may expect, Anonymous, as a group, joins WikiLeaks in their desire to expose the corruption of Hillary Clinton. Conflicts of interest, political scandals, money laundering, pay-for-play on an international scale, and more are the focus on Anonymous. \\nThe amount of information that is available on Hillary Clinton is intimidating, as her career has run for decades. \\nTake a look at the video below, also from Anonymous, and consider how she and Huma Abedin have found themselves in their current set of controversial circumstances.'"}, "time": 1742628539.7146378}
