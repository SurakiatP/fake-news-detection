For the first time in decades, the New York presidential primaries will be consequential to both the Democratic and the Republican nominations. \u201cIf you have a legitimate chance of victory, this is really your    time,\u201d David Birdsell, dean of the Baruch College School of Public Affairs, said of the candidates. So we\u2019ve heard them debate our values, weigh into local politics and barnstorm our public spaces with booming speeches. It\u2019s all to connect with New York\u2019s diverse voters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got liberal pockets, conservative pockets, upstate, downstate and the city,\u201d Mr. Birdsell said. \u201cThat keeps the conversation alive  . \u201d It\u2019s crunchtime. Our primaries come late in the voting calendar. And we\u2019re a   state, with 95 Republican and 291 Democratic delegates up for grabs. Donald J. Trump, for one, is looking for a big win here to avoid a contested convention and push past a troubling few weeks for his campaign. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio are also fighting, particularly to peel away as many delegates as possible from Mr. Trump. And a big win in New York could help Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fight for another day for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton. Especially if you\u2019re part of a crucial voting bloc, New York City could shape the outcome. The fun starts Tuesday.

During the city\u2019s brief reign as the nation\u2019s capital, George Washington and his family lived at 3 Cherry Street in Lower Manhattan. In Kips Bay, a townhouse at 123 Lexington Avenue was the home of Chester A. Arthur and where he took the oath of office in 1881. A few blocks south, a townhouse at 28 East 20th Street (now a replica) was the childhood home of Theodore Roosevelt, the only president born in New York City. And among the others, an apartment at 142 West 109th Street in Morningside Heights was where President Obama lived when he was a junior at Columbia University. It was even available for rent in 2010. At the time the landlord did not charge a presidential premium. New York Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a. m. till late morning. You can receive it via email.
