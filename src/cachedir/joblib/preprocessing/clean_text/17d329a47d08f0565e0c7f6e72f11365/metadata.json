Sam Brownback\u2019s veto of a bill to expand Medicaid, ending a quest that came improbably close to succeeding in this deep red state despite Mr. Brownback\u2019s unyielding opposition. In spite of a torrent of phone calls and   pleas from constituents over the weekend, and   lobbying by hospital leaders who said that expanding Medicaid would help save a number of rural hospitals from closing, the vote was 81 to 44, three short of the   majority needed for an override. The effort to expand Medicaid to cover 150, 000 additional   people in Kansas had been closely watched nationally, in part because it came just after President Trump and Republicans in Congress tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Success might have provided momentum in some of the other 18 states that have not yet expanded Medicaid under the health law to cover far more   adults. While two Republican lawmakers who had originally voted against expanding Medicaid switched sides and voted to override, two others who had supported the expansion bill when it passed the House in February voted to sustain the veto. One of them, Representative Clay Aurand, a Republican from Belleville, said he hoped Kansas could find a way to expand Medicaid in \u201ca more   way. \u201d Supporters of the expansion had argued that it could save lives and jobs. \u201cWe have the ability to help people who truly need it the most,\u201d Representative Cindy Holscher, a Democrat from Olathe, told her colleagues. \u201cWe have the ability to make a decision today that will save lives  \u2014   not just one, but potentially thousands. \u201d Representative Susan Concannon, a Republican from Beloit and a leading proponent of the expansion bill, said, \u201cWhat we know most of all is that if we do this, it will prevent closures of hospitals. \u201d Opponents of expansion questioned whether Kansas could afford it, expressed doubts about whether the federal government would continue to pay for most of it if the health care law eventually is repealed, and suggested the promised benefits to rural hospitals were overstated. Mr. Brownback vetoed the measure almost as soon as it reached his desk on Thursday, saying that the cost to the state would be \u201cirresponsible and unsustainable,\u201d and that it would be \u201cunwise\u201d to expand Medicaid while President Trump and Congress were still vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He also said the bill was unacceptable because it did not include a work requirement for beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion. While the federal government has never allowed states to require that people have jobs in order to receive Medicaid, the Trump administration has hinted that it may. Some   states are considering asking for changes to their Medicaid programs that could reduce recipients, including work requirements, premiums and even lifetime limits on Medicaid coverage. The vote in Kansas came five months after an election in which moderate Republicans and Democrats replaced a number of conservatives in the Legislature, breathing new life into an effort that had stalled for years. The House of Representatives voted 81 to 44 in February to expand Medicaid. The Senate followed last week with a    vote health committees in both chambers heard often emotional testimony from uninsured Kansans and from medical providers. The Affordable Care Act originally required all states to expand Medicaid to all adults earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, but the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out if they wished. Still, the law has played a major role in reducing the number of Americans without health insurance, with about 11 million   adults gaining coverage in the 31 states that have chosen to expand the program. In the 19 states that have not expanded Medicaid  \u2014   including some of the biggest, such as Florida and Texas  \u2014   millions of   people are stuck in a \u201ccoverage gap,\u201d earning too much for Medicaid under their states\u2019 stringent guidelines but too little to qualify for subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. David Jordan, executive director of Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, an advocacy group that formed last year to push for expanding Medicaid, said supporters were not giving up. \u201cThe problem of 150, 000 Kansans not having access to health care doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561961.629162}
