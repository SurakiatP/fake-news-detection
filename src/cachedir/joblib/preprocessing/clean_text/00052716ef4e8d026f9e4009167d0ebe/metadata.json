R.  \u2014   In March 1954, Rafael Cancel Miranda smuggled a gun into the United States Capitol and, with three other Puerto Rican nationalists, opened fire from the visitors\u2019 gallery. Five members of Congress were wounded. The attackers, three men and one woman, were swiftly arrested and tried. Mr. Cancel Miranda, then 23, received the longest sentence, 85 years. He served 25 years before his sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter. Today, Mr. Cancel Miranda is the last surviving attacker. He lives with his wife, Angie, on a quiet lane of bungalows in a part of San Juan where the streets take their names from stars and constellations. His eyesight is failing, but he still turns out for the occasional independence event, where younger people receive him as a legend. His ancient enmities are now fresher than ever because of the island\u2019s catastrophic $72 billion debt, which has placed Puerto Rico into what amounts to federal receivership. A   panel appointed by Congress and President Obama will soon hold sway over the island and its finances, which collapsed after years of   borrowing to cover rising   costs. To longtime nationalists like Mr. Cancel Miranda, it is yet more proof that colonialism is alive and well here. This helps Mr. Cancel Miranda explain something odd that happened this summer. In June, the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro J. Garc\u00eda Padilla, traveled to New York City and told a special committee of the United Nations that despite all appearances, Puerto Rico was still a colony of the United States. He sought the United Nations\u2019 help in achieving   for the island, which is a territory of the United States. \u201cPuerto Rico is hungry and thirsty for justice,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said. The special committee has called on Washington to \u201callow the Puerto Rican people fully to exercise their inalienable right to   and independence. \u201d To understand why Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla\u2019s remarks were so unusual, it helps to know that his Popular Democratic Party claims to have already freed Puerto Rico from the colonial yoke. The island\u2019s independence is a signature issue: The party takes credit for negotiating a unique status for Puerto Rico  \u2014   that of an \u201cassociated free state\u201d  \u2014   which is said to provide the best of both worlds, statehood and independence, without forcing Puerto Rico to choose. The party says it achieved that in 1954, and that Puerto Rico has been an \u201cassociated free state\u201d since. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie!\u201d Mr. Cancel Miranda said in a recent interview. \u201cWe never controlled our own country. \u201d Unusual events this year have brought many Puerto Ricans to much the same conclusion. In January, in a double jeopardy case, the United States Supreme Court held that Puerto Rico had no independent prosecutorial authority  \u2014   just the authority bestowed on it by the United States Congress. Few on the mainland may have paid attention, but in Puerto Rico, the decision prompted the Popular Democratic Party\u2019s president, David Bernier, a candidate for governor, to call for \u201can urgent review of the structure of the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. \u201d The party that invented the \u201cassociated free state\u201d was now questioning it. Next, Mr. Obama\u2019s administration invoked the territories clause of the Constitution as it pushed for a law allowing Puerto Rico to restructure its big debt. The clause gives Congress the power to enact \u201call needful rules and regulations\u201d for United States territories, and its use sent a strong signal to Puerto Rico that the island had no power to carry out its own law. When Congress passed the   law in June, it placed Puerto Rico\u2019s financial affairs under federal oversight, handled by a   board. This was widely seen as proof that \u201cassociated free state\u201d was a meaningless term. \u201cSeven unelected people are going to be controlling our lives,\u201d said Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Santiago, a senator from the Puerto Rican Independence Party who, like Mr. Bernier, is running for governor. \u201cIt\u2019s a dictatorship. \u201d She said the debt crisis had set profound changes in motion and she hoped Puerto Rico could finally \u201chave a legitimate process of decolonization. \u201d A White House spokeswoman, Brandi S. Hoffine, said it was clear that \u201cthe people of Puerto Rico want the issue of status to be resolved,\u201d and referred to the recommendations of a presidential task force for how that might happen. \u201cThe president remains committed to the principle of   for the people of Puerto Rico,\u201d she said. In an interview at his home, Mr. Cancel Miranda said the previous decolonization  \u2014   the one carried out by the Popular Democrats  \u2014   had been a sham, and had provoked the attack on Congress. He played grainy    video footage of himself as a young man, refusing to apologize for the shooting during questioning. Then he filled in some details. The United Nations had declared the 1950s a \u201cdecade of decolonization,\u201d he said, and Puerto Rico was put on a list of colonies to be freed. But, he said, Washington had merely appeared to go along with the proceedings  \u2014   its main preoccupation was the Cold War. It wanted to remove Puerto Rico from the list of colonies, but not give it full autonomy, Mr. Cancel Miranda said, which might have meant losing the island\u2019s ports, airfields and other strategic assets. Historians say United States officials helped to draft Puerto Rico\u2019s first Constitution, adding a provision  \u2014   now in dispute  \u2014   that   bonds be paid before everything else if money was tight. Washington also poured money into infrastructure on the island and offered tax breaks to American companies that came to Puerto Rico and created jobs. For better or worse, those programs won over some elected island officials who had previously favored independence. They devised the term \u201cassociated free state,\u201d which was said to mean that Puerto Rico was a sovereign coequal of the United States, pursuing common interests by mutual agreement. The term in Spanish, \u201cestado libre asociado,\u201d is used in Puerto Rico\u2019s Constitution. (The   version calls Puerto Rico a commonwealth.) In 1953, a United Nations special committee held hearings on whether Puerto Rico\u2019s name could be removed from the list of colonies. Mr. Cancel Miranda said he was there, listening as American delegates testified that Puerto Rico now had free elections, a Constitution and other essentials of  . Other witnesses, however, said it was all  . When the committee reconvened and voted, Mr. Cancel Miranda said, Washington\u2019s view prevailed. \u201cThat\u2019s when the nationalists said, \u2018We have to send a message,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cancel Miranda said. \u201cThat was the reason for the attack on Congress. \u201d Their message was silenced for decades by long prison sentences. Over the years, memories of the attack faded on the mainland. And in Puerto Rico, the ballot replaced armed insurgency. The Independence Party is respected but has not earned many votes  \u2014   though its popularity is growing, Ms. Santiago said. Now, it seems that most Puerto Ricans believe the associated free state was a sham, even if it is not clear what they will do about it. \u201cYou saw what I said in 1954: \u2018I\u2019m not sorry,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cancel Miranda said. \u201cAnd 62 years later, I\u2019m still not sorry. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563884.52036}
