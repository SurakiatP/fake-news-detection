The   panel, suggesting that the ban did not advance national security, said the administration had shown \u201cno evidence\u201d that anyone from the seven nations  \u2014   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  \u2014   had committed terrorist acts in the United States. The ruling also rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that courts are powerless to review a president\u2019s national security assessments. Judges have a crucial role to play in a constitutional democracy, the court said. \u201cIt is beyond question,\u201d the decision said, \u201cthat the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action. \u201d The decision was handed down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. It upheld a ruling last Friday by a federal district judge, James L. Robart, who blocked key parts of the travel ban, allowing thousands of foreigners to enter the country. The appeals court acknowledged that Mr. Trump was owed deference on his immigration and national security policies. But it said he was claiming something more  \u2014   that \u201cnational security concerns are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections. \u201d Within minutes of the ruling, Mr. Trump angrily vowed to fight it, presumably in an appeal to the Supreme Court. \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. At the White House, the president told reporters that the ruling was \u201ca political decision\u201d and predicted that his administration would win an appeal \u201cin my opinion, very easily. \u201d He said he had not yet conferred with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on the matter. The Supreme Court remains   and could deadlock. A    tie there would leave the appeals court\u2019s ruling in place. The administration has moved fast in the case so far, and it is likely to file an emergency application to the Supreme Court in a day or two. The court typically asks for a prompt response from the other side, and it could rule soon after it received one. A decision next week, either to reinstate the ban or to continue to block it, is possible. The travel ban, one of the first executive orders Mr. Trump issued after taking office, suspended worldwide refugee entry into the United States. It also barred visitors from seven   nations for up to 90 days to give federal security agencies time to impose stricter vetting processes. Immediately after it was issued, the ban spurred chaos at airports and protests nationwide as foreign travelers found themselves stranded at immigration checkpoints by a policy that critics derided as  . The State Department said up to 60, 000 foreigners\u2019 visas were canceled in the days immediately after the ban was imposed. The World Relief Corporation, one of the agencies that resettles refugees in the United States, called the ruling \u201cfabulous news\u201d for 275 newcomers who are scheduled to arrive in the next week, many of whom will be reunited with family. \u201cWe have families that have been separated for years by terror, war and persecution,\u201d said Scott Arbeiter, the president of the organization, which will arrange for housing and jobs for the refugees in cities including Seattle Spokane, Wash. and Sacramento. \u201cSome family members had already been vetted and cleared and were standing with tickets, and were then told they couldn\u2019t travel,\u201d Mr. Arbeiter said. \u201cSo the hope of reunification was crushed, and now they will be admitted. \u201d Several Democrats said they hoped the appeals court ruling would cow Mr. Trump into rescinding the ban. Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California, said in a statement that the ban \u201cis rooted in bigotry and, most importantly, it\u2019s illegal. \u201d \u201cWe will not stop,\u201d Ms. Bass said. But some Republicans cast aspersions on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision and predicted that it would not withstand a challenge in the Supreme Court. \u201cCourts ought not   sensitive national security decisions of the president,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said in a statement. \u201cThis misguided ruling is from the Ninth Circuit, the most notoriously   court in America, and the   court at the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident the administration\u2019s position will ultimately prevail. \u201d Trial judges nationwide have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, but no other case has yet reached an appeals court. The case in front of Judge Robart, in Seattle, was filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota and is still at an early stage. The appeals court order issued Thursday ruled only on the narrow question of whether to stay a lower court\u2019s temporary restraining order blocking the travel ban. The appeals court said the government had not justified suspending travel from the seven countries. \u201cThe government has pointed to no evidence,\u201d the decision said, \u201cthat any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. \u201d The three members of the panel were Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush. They said the states were likely to succeed at the end of the day because Mr. Trump\u2019s order appeared to violate the due process rights of lawful permanent residents, people holding visas and refugees. The court said the administration\u2019s legal position in the case had been a moving target. It noted that Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, had issued \u201cauthoritative guidance\u201d several days after the executive order came out, saying it did not apply to lawful permanent residents. But the court said that \u201cwe cannot rely\u201d on that statement. \u201cThe White House counsel is not the president,\u201d the decision said, \u201cand he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the executive departments.\u201c It also mentioned \u201cthe government\u2019s shifting interpretations\u201d of the executive order. In its briefs and in the arguments before the panel on Tuesday, the Justice Department\u2019s position evolved. As the case progressed, the administration offered a backup plea for at least a partial victory. At most, a Justice Department brief said, \u201cpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future\u201d should be allowed to enter the country despite the ban. The appeals court ultimately rejected that request, however, saying that people in the United States without authorization have due process rights, as do citizens with relatives who wish to travel to the United States. The court discussed, but did not decide, whether the executive order violated the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion by disfavoring Muslims. It noted that the states challenging the executive order \u201chave offered evidence of numerous statements by the president about his intent to implement a \u2018Muslim ban. \u2019\u201d And it said, rejecting another administration argument, that it was free to consider evidence about the motivation behind laws that draw seemingly neutral distinctions. But the court said it would defer a decision on the question of religious discrimination. \u201cThe political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions,\u201d the decision said. \u201cFor now, it is enough for us to conclude that the government has failed to establish that it will likely succeed on its due process argument in this appeal. \u201d The court also acknowledged \u201cthe massive attention this case has garnered at even the most preliminary stages. \u201d \u201cOn the one hand, the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies,\u201d the decision said. \u201cAnd on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination. \u201d \u201cThese competing public interests,\u201d the court said, \u201cdo not justify a stay. \u201d The court ruling did not affect one part of the executive order: the cap of 50, 000 refugees to be admitted in the 2017 fiscal year. That is down from the 110, 000 ceiling put in place under President Barack Obama. The order also directed the secretary of state and the secretary of homeland security to prioritize refugee claims made by persecuted members of religious minorities. As of Thursday, that means the United States will be allowed to accept only about 16, 000 more refugees this fiscal year. Since Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, 33, 929 refugees have been admitted, 5, 179 of them Syrians.'"}, "time": 1742563418.1816435}
