The reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign, it will be because Republicans are coming back to Trump. \\nThere are few undecided voters in this election, and even if all the Republican base come home to Trump, it won\u2019t be enough for Trump to win, because he is losing where the presidential election is really held. Trump is getting crushed at the state level. \\nRepublicans have been trying to build Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails into a story for years, and they have failed at every turn. \\nHillary Clinton led the election while under Congressional investigation. Hillary Clinton led the election while under FBI investigation. Hillary Clinton is leading the election today. The message that Republicans and the media don\u2019t want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails, and they don\u2019t care. \\nVoters are smarter than Republicans and the press give them credit for. The Hillary Clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that Clinton did anything wrong. \\nIf the polls tighten a little, this will be the best news in the world for Hillary Clinton and Democrats, because it will destroy any potential for Democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls. \\nWhat Geoff Garin witnessed is probably going to end up being very accurate. James Comey\u2019s letter to Congress is unlikely to move swing states and change the outcome of the presidential election.'"}, "time": 1742563533.8962767}
