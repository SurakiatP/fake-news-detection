[It never gets old! Also, this exercise reminds us of the many things we are thankful for this week: Donald Trump, the cluelessness of his opponents, and Nexis transcripts.  Our featured GOP consultant this week is Matthew Dowd, chief strategist for the   campaign and   Mr. Magoo. Nominally a conservative in a liberal business, Dowd couldn\u2019t pull off a full Arianna, so if he wanted to sit in a warm studio on Sunday mornings issuing pronouncements as if from Mount Olympus, he had to come up with an act. Even a guy like Dowd  \u2014   wrong on everything else, from the time of day to whether it\u2019s raining  \u2014   accurately sussed out what the media wanted: a   playing \u201cthe conservative. \u201d How else to explain the fact that the entire American media refused to have on anyone who supported the man who just won a landslide presidential election? The territory Dowd carved out for himself was: patriotic sage, above partisanship, announcing on every subject that both sides were wrong, he alone was right. This made him a regular panelist on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d with George Stephanopoulos. Dowd\u2019s \u201cboth sides are wrong\u201d offering to the   church was condescending and tiresome, but it would help if he were, from time to time, correct. Instead, from the moment Trump announced, Dowd treated us to hilariously boneheaded prognostications that were instantly proved wrong and never acknowledged as he issued each successive boneheaded prediction. On Feb. 7, 2016, Dowd pronounced that the nominations would be wrapped up in \u201cApril for the Democrats and May for the Republicans. \u201d Trump won the nomination by May 4 and Hillary won it in June  \u2014   two months after Dowd\u2019s confident prediction. On April 3, Dowd said Trump \u201ccan\u2019t win a general election for all intents and purposes. \u201d (\u201cFor all intents and purposes\u201d is what consultants add to   statements to make them sound weighty.) Trump won the election  \u2014   and he won it with far more electoral votes than Dowd\u2019s candidate ever got. On May 1, Dowd said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a    election, unfortunately. \u201d Trump won both white men and white women, decisively. White women without a college degree carried the Midwest for Trump. (See here.) Dowd spent several Sundays in May assuring viewers that a   candidate would be on stage at the debates: \u201cI think there is likely to be somebody else standing in the debates and that changes the dynamics. \u201d That never happened. After Trump wrapped up the nomination, Dowd claimed he had predicted it! \u201cWell, I was very bullish on Donald Trump in the primaries,\u201d he said on May 8. His use of the term \u201cbullish\u201d was, well,  . As for Trump winning the general election, Dowd declared it \u201cunlikely. \u201d (Based on his fantastical recollections of his own predictions, I assume he is currently claiming to have predicted Trump\u2019s win in the general election.) In the week leading up to the election, Dowd was a whirling dervish of soothsaying on Twitter: NOVEMBER 1, \u201c@matthewjdowd Any expenditure of time or money by Trump in PA, VA, MI and NH is a total waste. Campaign mismanagement if they keep it up. \u201d Of the four states Dowd considered \u201ca total waste\u201d for Trump to campaign in, he won the two biggest, worth more than twice as many electoral votes as the other two combined  \u2014   and one of those he lost by only 0. 3 percent. NOVEMBER 2, \u201c@matthewjdowd clinton has a better chance of carrying Arizona than trump does of carrying Mi or Wi\u201d Trump carried both Michigan and Wisconsin. Hillary did not win Arizona. NOVEMBER 4, \u201c@matthewjdowd Look for sure signs Trump will lose: 1. \u2018The only poll that matters is election day\u2019 2. \u2018Our vote doesn\u2019t show up in polls.\u2019 3. \u2018Truman\u2019\u201d Although Trump never made any excuses  \u2014   he won!  \u2014   all three of those statements turned out to be true. (See Time magazine\u2019s \u201cMadam President\u201d issue.) NOVEMBER 5 was Dowd\u2019s Latino Appreciation Day: \u201c@matthewjdowd even if Trump gets the exact % of votes of whites, blacks  Asians as Bush in 2004, Trump would lose by 3 million votes due to Latinos. \u201d \u201c@matthewjdowd Trump will lose latino voters by a larger margin than romney. Who set a new modern low. \u201d \u201c@matthewjdowd It looks like Trump campaign was right, the silent hidden vote is showing up: Latinos are voting at record levels. Motivated by Trump. \u201d Trump won more of the Hispanic vote than either McCain or Romney  \u2014   and probably more than Bush, for whom we only have nonsense numbers (as both Republican and Democratic analysts agree  \u2014   see here and here). NOVEMBER 6, \u201c@matthewjdowd If trump loses Ohio and Florida one reason is that Clinton campaign head faked them into thinking he had chance in Michigan.  media helped\u201d Trump won Michigan. Also Ohio and Florida. On Nov. 6  \u2014   48 hours before the election  \u2014   Dowd announced on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Trump would lose, \u201cand lose badly. \u201d Bored with his own omniscience, Dowd explained, \u201cGeorge, to me, this election has been   \u2026     incredibly predictable actually from the primary. \u201d Mr. Magoo had more wisdom to impart: \u201cOn election night, Hillary Clinton\u2019s margins among nonwhite voters and among   voters are going to be the highest margins we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201d Dowd\u2019s sweeping declarations turned out to be less accurate than a blindfolded monkey throwing darts in a bar. On Twitter, Dowd assured his readers: NOVEMBER 7, \u201c@matthewjdowd Clinton wins by five points. Over 300 electoral votes. Trump loses by more popular votes than Romney. \u201d Final electoral vote: Trump, 304 Clinton, 227. TV bookers couldn\u2019t get enough of Dowd. What smugness! What monumental cluelessness! ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d is a show famous for confronting guests with their own prior statements. Would ABC play this game with its own Powerhouse Roundtable prognosticators? Surely a man of Dowd\u2019s integrity would come on the air and admit, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have been more wrong!\u201d HELLO! That didn\u2019t happen at all! Dowd was allowed to sit out the Sunday after the election. The following Sunday, he was in his usual seat on the Powerhouse Roundtable, right back to giving his sweeping, grinning predictions, with no acknowledgment that he had been spectacularly  \u2014   and characteristically  \u2014   wrong in every prediction he\u2019d made, all year long. That\u2019s why Dowd is our   Mr. Magoo. As Trump is being sworn in and visions of the wall are dancing in your head, remember that if he ever runs out of bricks, he can always use Republican consultants.'"}, "time": 1742562666.3684149}
