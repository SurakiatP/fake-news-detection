[The GOP overhaul \u201cis much more disliked than the ACA [Obamacare] and [President Bill] Clinton\u2019s health care reform bill were when they were first introduced,\u201d the site reported. March 23. \u201cAcross nine surveys, the [American Health Care Act] has garnered an average of just 32 percent in favor compared with 45 percent opposed. \u201d   Clinton\u2019s 1993 healthcare plan was dubbed \u201cHillarycare\u201d by GOP opponents because first lady Hillary Clinton played a central role in designing the doomed proposal for a   healthcare network. Opponents are also more enthusiastically opposed to Ryancare than its supporters are supportive, says the site, adding: enthusiasm is on the side of those against change  \u2014   just as it was in 1993 and 2009. In the most recent Fox News poll, only 17 percent of Americans strongly favored the AHCA  \u2026     Forty percent strongly opposed it. SurveyMonkey and YouGov polls show comparable splits. These numbers look a lot like an NPR poll from late July 2009, in which only 25 percent of Americans were strongly in favor of Obama\u2019s health care bill and 39 percent were strongly against it  \u2026     Even in early November 1993, a Wirthlin Group survey found that those strongly opposed (27 percent) [to Hillarycare] outnumbered those who were strongly in favor (21 percent). The new report was backed up by a Quinnipiac poll released March 23, which showed that swing voters and GOP supporters dislike the bill, which was drafted under the supervision of House Speaker Paul Ryan.  : Whites   a college degree (Trump\u2019s base) oppose AHCA by 26 points. https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) March 23, 2017,  Read it all here.
