The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers, creeks and drains. It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality. \u201cIt\u2019s poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem,\u201d said Anthony Boxshall, the agency\u2019s manager of applied sciences, noting that the waste was coming from people, dogs, horses, cows, birds and other animals. Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems, including gastroenteritis. Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the   Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip, affecting the city\u2019s bayside beaches the most. The agency, which takes regular water samples, rates beaches. A \u201cgood\u201d rating means that the water is suitable for swimming. \u201cFair\u201d means that rainfall has affected the water. \u201cPoor\u201d means people should avoid it. Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual. \u201cWhen the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit, Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach,\u201d said Sam Riley, who lives in the city. \u201cI was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer, but now I\u2019m concerned about whether the water is clean. \u201d Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beaches\u2019 water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued. The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops.'"}, "time": 1742562980.643679}
