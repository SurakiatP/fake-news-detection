When bullet casings fly from a machine gun, each one is clearly visible rather than appearing in a blur. When Billy Lynn (Joe Alwyn) a soldier on leave from Iraq, tears up at the national anthem or experiences battle flashbacks during the smoke bombs of a Destiny\u2019s Child performance, the emotions in his eyes register with uncommon clarity. On the other hand, when Steve Martin mugs as the owner of a pro football team, his face contains a level of detail normally preferred by dermatologists. These are the   of working at a high frame rate, the speed at which a film is shot and, in some cases, projected. The rate has a strong effect on an image\u2019s sharpness. Mr. Lee shot \u201cBilly Lynn\u201d at 120 frames per second, far faster than 24, the standard for about 90 years. Few theaters are presenting it at that rate, so most viewers are out of luck  \u2014   or perhaps better off, depending on your views on frame rates. For some directors, like Peter Jackson  \u2014   who shot \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d at 48 frames per second, to largely negative reaction  \u2014   and James Cameron, higher frame rates are the future of movies, an opportunity to correct the motion blur that afflicts   action sequences shot at the standard rate. Introducing \u201cBilly Lynn\u201d at the New York Film Festival last month, Mr. Lee, who won a directing Oscar for his work with   digital cinema on \u201cLife of Pi,\u201d expressed trepidation about reaction to what he called \u201ckind of an experimental movie\u201d and asked the audience to keep an open mind. He had reason to worry. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter offered a typical reaction. The film, he wrote in his review, had the \u201csomewhat distancing   sharpness of many outsize     TVs. \u201d High frame rates aren\u2019t new they\u2019re used in video games and on television. And that\u2019s the problem: Viewers, accustomed to the softer texture of movies, see the extreme sharpness of    cinema and feel intuitively that they\u2019ve stumbled into a theatrical broadcast or a football game. \u201cIf you start increasing the frame rate of the movie, whether it\u2019s 48 or 60 or 120, it can tend to start looking like a television show,\u201d said Douglas Trumbull, a director and special effects expert who has been a pioneer in high frame rates. In the 1970s, he developed the Showscan process, which ran at 60 frames per second. Still, he said, there is no need for that association: \u201cI can guarantee you that we can make a    movie that does not look like television. \u201d The 24    rate, at which most movies, even digitally projected ones, are shown, was always something of an accident. At the dawn of sound, when the rate was standardized, going more slowly would have muddied the audio and going faster would have exceeded the sensitivity of existing film stocks, said Dean Goodhill, one of the editors of \u201cThe Fugitive\u201d and an inventor of MaxiVision48, a    process from the late 1990s that never got beyond a demonstration clip. There were other experiments with frame rates in the celluloid era. The   process of the 1950s ran at 30 frames per second. Cinerama used three simultaneous projectors and ran at 26 frames per second. In both cases, the higher rates were needed to accommodate outsize screens that made flicker and blur more visible. Tim J. Smith, an academic who studies visual cognition at Birkbeck, University of London, said there is no scientific reason 24 frames per second should be more appealing to viewers. \u201cWhat we\u2019re coming into the cinema with is the same audiovisual sensory system we have before we go into the cinema,\u201d he said. In theory, he said, the move to a higher frame rate should \u201clead to more natural, more effortless processing by the viewer\u2019s visual system. \u201d Acculturation may be the main reason moviegoers find the sharpness  . \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that people are sensitive to it,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing a crispness to the image, which is unfamiliar in the cinema context. Their main frame of reference seems to be TV or video, and kind of implied by that association is \u2018cheapness\u2019 or \u2018documentary\u2019 or \u2018immediacy.\u2019 Is it good to have that? It\u2019s hard to know. \u201d But the film historian David Bordwell said that high frame rates have only   as a solution to a problem that is specific to digital cinema, particularly murky digital   which grows less murky when frames are added. He noted that at least on a   screen, there was never any of the dreaded stammer in the panning shots of Kenji Mizoguchi, Max Oph\u00fcls or Jean Renoir. \u201cPeople who doubt it should see the films (on film, not video) to check,\u201d he wrote by email. For Mr. Trumbull, who demonstrated   rates for Mr. Lee but did not take part in the production of \u201cBilly Lynn,\u201d the increased film speed of his Showscan process was a natural outgrowth of the move toward bigger screens and bigger spectacles in the 1950s and 1960s, but a faster rate was never taken up as the industry moved toward multiplexes and tiny auditoriums. He was effusive about Mr. Lee and his willingness to experiment  \u2014   a \u201cwonderful, brave and courageous effort,\u201d he said. But after watching the movie at the New York Film Festival, he wasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cI was really upset when I was at the premiere of \u2018Billy Lynn\u2019 that it was in a very narrow,   theater,\u201d he said. He felt that it was projected with too much illumination, that it needed dark time between frames. (We don\u2019t perceive them as such, but movies are successions of still images  \u2014   and on most projectors, each flash is interspersed with moments of darkness.) \u201cBilly Lynn\u201d has almost no darkness. In response, Ben Gervais, the film\u2019s technical supervisor, said, \u201cWe found that there was no real advantage in terms of the way that the movie felt\u201d with added dark time. Mr. Trumbull also said that it was crucial to present the film on a screen that filled a wider frame of vision, like Imax, to show the benefits of   rates and to keep cinematic texture. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t draw conclusions about high frame rates as a result of \u2018Billy Lynn\u2019 being incorrectly presented,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be really tragic. \u201d Mr. Trumbull has a competing   rate format, Magi, which is different from Showscan. But he said Magi has solved what he sees as the problems of \u201cBilly Lynn. \u201d It may also be necessary, he added, for filmmakers to alter their approaches to suit the format. He recalled his own experience working on the visual effects of \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d for which the camera motion was slowed so that the visuals would look smooth on a giant screen. \u201cThat\u2019s what kind of led to the style of the movie,\u201d he said. Like Mr. Trumbull, Mr. Goodhill said that it was possible to retain the cinematic texture while gaining the clarity of the higher frame rate. MaxiVision48  \u2014   lavishly praised in 1999 by Roger Ebert, among others  \u2014   looked \u201cboth new and traditional at the same time,\u201d he recalled. But he emphasized that he doesn\u2019t necessarily regard that texture as the right one. \u201cThat\u2019s up for the individual artist to decide. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562384.9237027}
