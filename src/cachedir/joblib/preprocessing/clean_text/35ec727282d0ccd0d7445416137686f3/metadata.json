The highlights (and our longer analysis): \u2022 Mrs. Clinton, wearing a white suit and a wide smile, accepted the Democratic nomination for president shortly before 11:00 Eastern time. \u201cIt is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America\u2019s promise,\u201d she said over a roaring crowd, \u201cthat I accept your nomination for President of the United States. \u201d She welcomed the night\u2019s historic nature, invoking her mother and her daughter, and tried to shed light on the motivation of her life\u2019s work. But mostly, she used a nearly hourlong speech to lay out a vision of America   in opposition to the one Mr. Trump put forth last week in Cleveland. To Mr. Trump\u2019s promise that \u201cI, alone, can fix it,\u201d Mrs. Clinton countered that \u201cnone of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone. \u201d _____ \u2022 Chelsea Clinton, who grew up in the national spotlight, introduced her mother  \u2014   \u201cmy wonderful, thoughtful, hilarious mother\u201d  \u2014   in starkly personal terms. Recounting notes left when her mother was out of town, conversations at the dinner table, and even Mrs. Clinton\u2019s failed 1994 health care fight, Ms. Clinton said she is often asked how does her mother \u201ckeep going amid the sound and the fury of politics?\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s how,\u201d she answered: \u201cIt\u2019s because she never, ever forgets who she\u2019s fighting for. \u201d _____ \u2022 John R. Allen, the retired   Marine Corps general who commanded American forces in Afghanistan and elsewhere, delivered a thundering endorsement of Mrs. Clinton because, he said, \u201cthe stakes are enormous\u201d not to. Flanked by fellow veterans, Mr. Allen said that Mrs. Clinton would use all the \u201cinstruments of American power\u201d to defeat ISIS, strengthen NATO, and honor its treaties. \u201cWithout any hesitation or reservation,\u201d Hillary Clinton will be \u201cexactly, exactly the kind of    America needs,\u201d Mr. Allen said. With Mrs. Clinton as commander in chief, \u201cour international relations will not be reduced to a business transaction. \u201d _____ \u2022 \u201cI\u2019m Michael Jordan, and I\u2019m here with Hillary,\u201d Kareem   the N. B. A. hall of famer, deadpanned as he appraised a perplexed convention hall. \u201cI said that because I know that Donald Trump couldn\u2019t tell the difference,\u201d he clarified, with a smile. Speaking more seriously, Mr.   who is Muslim, warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants amounted to the kind of tyranny warned of by the country\u2019s founders. _____ \u2022 Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio brought attention back to manufacturing and trade policy, arguing that Donald J. Trump was not the authentic champion of American workers he claimed to be. Highlighting the foreign provenance of many of Mr. Trump\u2019s products and the clients and investors his businesses have harmed, Mr. Brown said the only thing Mr. Trump\u2019s business record made certain was that \u201cDonald Trump looks out only for Donald Trump. \u201d _____ \u2022 The night\u2019s final speaking slot for a   went to Representative Xavier Becerra of California, the son of Mexican immigrants. Reiterating many of the night\u2019s themes, he urged those listening to walk with Mrs. Clinton as she had with them. \u201cNow is not the time to turn back. \u201d _____ \u2022 Republicans for Clinton? The night featured at least two: Doug Elmets, an aide who worked in Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House, and Jennifer Pierotti Lim, the director of health policy at the U. S. Chamber of Commerce. They had a message for fellow Republicans dissatisfied with Mr. Trump: Mrs. Clinton may not be perfect but her hands are steady. \u201cI knew Ronald Reagan. I worked for Ronald Reagan,\u201d Mr. Elmets said. \u201cDonald Trump, you are no Ronald Reagan. \u201d _____ \u2022 Some Democratic women of the Senate took turns testifying to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s work and character  \u2014   often in highly personal terms. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri recalled calls from Mrs. Clinton this year when she was diagnosed with cancer. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York talked of how Mrs. Clinton had inspired her to enter public life. And Senator Barbara Boxer of California remembered the \u201cworkhorse, humble, steady and ready to learn\u201d who arrived in the Senate in 2001. _____ \u2022 Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, a rising star within the Democratic Party, spoke of his grandmother, a Mexican immigrant who settled in Texas as a young girl. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a rapist or a murderer,\u201d he said, referencing Donald J. Trump\u2019s contentious remarks about why he would build a wall along the border with Mexico. \u201cShe was a    orphan. \u201d _____ \u2022 Invoking the memory of his father and the record of his home state, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York tried to paint a picture of the party as one of \u201cdreamers\u201d and \u201cdoers. \u201d Republicans under Mr. Trump, on the other hand, he said, \u201cfan the flames of fear and offer a scapegoat\u201d for the country\u2019s problems: notably, those different from themselves. \u201cFear is a powerful weapon. It can excite and motivate,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. But, \u201cfear will never build a nation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563643.0070255}
