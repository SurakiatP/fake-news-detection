Other high-level VA officials directly responsible for the suffering of America\u2019s veterans received tens of thousands of dollars worth of bonuses \u2014 and Uncle Sam isn\u2019t asking for any of it back. \\nIf that doesn\u2019t make your blood boil, you aren\u2019t paying attention.   \\nThis is government corruption at its absolute finest. While ordinary citizens who did their duty to this country are forced to drain their bank accounts because the government screwed up (again), executives and corrupt officials get to live large. \\nCorruption like this is why Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is so popular. Washington is indeed a swamp , and he is the only one who can drain it. Someone like Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, a 30-year insider, isn\u2019t going to fix what is broken. \\nOn Wednesday morning, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that the Pentagon would be \u201csuspending\u201d its program to collect the bonuses from the soldiers who had improperly received them, Fox News reported, although it was presumed that the program would be resumed once some kinks had been worked out. \\nIf we had a federal government that actually spent money correctly and held people accountable for mistakes, these former soldiers wouldn\u2019t be in precarious financial situations today.
