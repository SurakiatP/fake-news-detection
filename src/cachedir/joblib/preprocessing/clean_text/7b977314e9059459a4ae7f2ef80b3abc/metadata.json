[\u201cAt Google   this year, we announced Google for Jobs, a new   initiative focused on helping both job seekers and employers, through collaboration with the job matching industry,\u201d declared Google in an official blog post on Tuesday. \u201cOne major part of this effort is launching an improved experience for job seekers on Google Search. We\u2019re happy to announce this new experience is now open for all developers and site owners. \u201d  \u201cFor queries with clear intent like [head of catering jobs in nyc] or [entry level jobs in DC] we\u2019ll show a job listings preview, and each job can expand to display comprehensive details about the listing,\u201d they continued. \u201cIf you already publish your job openings on another site like LinkedIn, Monster, DirectEmployers, CareerBuilder, Glassdoor, and Facebook, they are eligible to appear in the feature as well. \u201d Employers will be able to list their available positions on the search engine, along with their company logo, job details, and reviews and ratings from current employees. Users looking for a job will be able to filter terms and positions in their determined location, allowing them to find more specific openings than other job listing sites. \u201cFor added convenience going forward with any job hunt, it will also be possible to turn on alerts for a particular job search, with Google sending a notification via email when relevant new positions are advertised online,\u201d explained TechRadar. \u201cWe should hopefully see this functionality introduced in the UK (and other territories) before too long, but for now, as mentioned, this is a   proposition. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
