At least that was the case for me after my first trip to South Africa to visit the family of the woman who eventually became my wife. At 28, I was still pretty new to flying, and spending the better part of an entire day trapped in an airborne steel tube was just what I needed to stop worrying and learn to love the miracle of air travel. O. K. the truth is, I still don\u2019t love to fly. But after that first marathon ride from New York to Johannesburg, which is among the longest   flights in existence, my focus has at least shifted from how to survive to how to make the long haul as painless as possible. The simplest way to guarantee a decent meal and some legroom is to upgrade to first class, but if you don\u2019t have the luxury of spending a few hundred extra for premium seats, all is not lost. \u201cMost air carriers configure their   economy cabins with slightly more legroom and added amenities,\u201d said  Patrick Smith, a pilot who is author of \u201cCockpit Confidential: Everything You Need to Know About Air Travel. \u201d These amenities typically include free access to entertainment consoles, meals and alcoholic beverages. In other words, airlines are not completely evil, and are less likely to    you during   flights. That also applies to legroom. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of leg space available in economy class during my first long haul to South Africa. But this does vary by airline. South African Airways has roomier seats (by one to two inches) on its nonstop flight from New York to Johannesburg than any other airline that flies between those two cities, according to Routehappy. com, a useful site that allows you to compare amenities before booking. Consider Seatguru. com when trying to find the most comfortable seat. But these freebies and a little extra legroom will get you only so far. A smartly packed   bag is essential. \u201cA big mistake is expecting the flight attendants to take care of everything for you,\u201d said Kara Mulder, a flight attendant who chronicles her   experiences on her blog, The Flight Attendant Life.  Ms. Mulder recommends taking your own water, a sweatshirt and socks to keep you warm (I never fly without my hoodie) and some of your favorite healthy snacks. \u201cDon\u2019t just eat the free food the flight attendants serve because it\u2019s there,\u201d Ms. Mulder said. \u201cYour body will respond differently to different foods when at altitude. \u201d Dry oatmeal and dried fruit are favorites of Ms. Mulder. I\u2019ve found trail mix and protein and granola bars to be safe and sustainable options. I\u2019ve also learned not to be shy. If you napped your way through mealtime or did not pack enough water, take a walk to where the flight attendants are and ask for what you need. You still have 13 hours to go. Nothing puts a damper on a vacation like a blood clot in the knee. Studies have found that   travel increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, and that height is an additional risk factor, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s still a rare condition, but the C. D. C. recommends \u201cambulation,\u201d which is a fancy word for walking and thigh exercises, and suggests aisle seats for those who are particularly tall. Even if you\u2019re not concerned about a blood clot, walking and stretching will make you less miserable in general, and there is plenty you can do without even leaving your seat. How about a little yoga at 39, 000 feet? \u201cWhen it comes to a physical release, the yoga exercises help right away,\u201d said Kajuan Douglas, a yoga instructor in New York City. \u201c You feel the physical stretch, and it\u2019s like you have just awakened from sleep. \u201d You do not have to be a yogi to benefit from these stretches. The simplest ones can bring instant satisfaction. For beginners, Mr. Douglas recommends the \u201cLocust Bind\u201d stretch, which involves interlacing your fingers behind your back and drawing your shoulder blades toward each other, and \u201cseated twisting,\u201d placing your hand on your opposite knee or thigh and twisting from the upper back. It may seem hard to do when the toddler behind you is kicking your seat or your neighbor is snoring. \u201cTo help overcome these difficulties, I bring more awareness to my breath or add a simple mantra,\u201d Mr. Douglas said. \u201cSimply recite \u2018inhale let, exhale go\u2019 \u201d mentally as you breathe. \u201d If there is a silver lining to having 16 hours to kill, it\u2019s that you can at least get something accomplished like work or reading that novel you\u2019ve yet to make a dent in. But it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, especially if you do not plan ahead. You may be distracted by turbulence or the drink cart rolling by, and that first gin and tonic leads to another. Before you know it, you\u2019re poking at the entertainment console and pondering which Adam Sandler movie you haven\u2019t already seen 10 times. \u201cI\u2019m an author and blogger who writes about air travel,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201cbut I find it almost impossible to get anything done, even with my subject matter all around me. \u201d Compartmentalizing your time is the way to go, and can make the flight feel much shorter. \u201cDevote blocks of time to certain tasks,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cPick out a couple of movies to watch that\u2019s three or four hours right there. Spend a couple of hours reading, then a couple of hours napping if you can, and so on. \u201d If you are intent on getting work done, you could try something like the Pomodoro Technique, which divides work into   intervals and separates them by short breaks. \u201cI can be on a   flight and not watch one movie from the plane\u2019s   entertainment system sometimes, simply because I planned out my tasks and airplane relax time so well,\u201d Ms. Mulder said. \u201cThose are good flights. \u201d That still feels like an oxymoron to folks like me but less so these days.'"}, "time": 1742564198.4745815}
