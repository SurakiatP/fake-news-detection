Elsewhere, this might lead to praise, but in Camden  \u2014   where 40 percent of residents live below the poverty line, the murder rate compares to that of El Salvador and one of the most interesting experiments in American policing is underway  \u2014   Chief J. Scott Thomson sees aggressive ticket writing as a sign that his officers don\u2019t get the new program. \u201cHanding a $250 ticket to someone who is making $13, 000 a year\u201d  \u2014   around the per capita income in the city  \u2014   \u201ccan be life altering,\u201d Chief Thomson said in an interview last year, noting that it can make car insurance unaffordable or result in the loss of a driver\u2019s license. \u201cTaxing a poor community is not going to make it stronger. \u201d Handling more vehicle stops with a warning, rather than a ticket, is one element of Chief Thomson\u2019s new approach, which, for lack of another name, might be called the Hippocratic ethos of policing: Minimize harm, and try to save lives. Officers are trained to hold their fire when possible, especially when confronting people wielding knives and showing signs of mental illness, and to engage them in conversation when commands of \u201cdrop the knife\u201d don\u2019t work. This sometimes requires backing up to a safer distance. Or relying on patience rather than anything on an officer\u2019s gun belt. And Chief Thomson has told officers that when they respond to shootings  \u2014   or after the police open fire  \u2014   they should carry the wounded into their cruisers and rush to the hospital, rather than wait for an ambulance. Such changes were shaped partly by headlines and YouTube videos from far beyond Camden, a city of some 80, 000 that for decades has been synonymous with blight and decline. The unrest in Ferguson, Mo. after a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in 2014, and the video from Staten Island of a dying Eric Garner gasping through a police chokehold, ignited a national dialogue about policing and race. Police departments were pressured to reconsider their policies for using force. Nationwide, many departments responded by issuing   cameras turning to \u201c \u201d training in an effort to shoot fewer people and paying more attention to how the police are perceived by black residents. Across the country, the political momentum for police reform has slowed over the last year, even before the election of President Trump, whose administration has taken the position that federal efforts to make the police more accountable have made them less effective. Ambush attacks in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La. last year left eight officers dead, shifting the national discussion away from excessive force and toward the dangers officers face. But not in Camden, where changes have been openly received and are taking hold within the department. \u201cThe old police mantra was make it home safely,\u201d said Tyrrell Bagby, 25, an affable   Camden police officer. \u201cNow we\u2019re being taught not only should we make it home safely, but so should the victim and the suspect. \u201d Officer Bagby has saved 22 lives since joining the force in 2014 by administering naloxone, a drug that reverses opioid overdoses. An early sign that Chief Thomson\u2019s message was taking hold among his officers came on Nov. 9, 2015, when a    man walked into a Crown Fried Chicken, behaved menacingly toward customers and employees, brandished a steak knife and left. Outside, officers ordered him to drop the knife, according to video from police body cameras. But the man began walking away, slashing the knife through the air as he went. For several minutes, the officers formed a cordon around the man and walked with him for a few blocks, trying to clear traffic ahead and periodically instructing him to drop the knife. The crisis ended when the man did just that. Had the episode taken place a year before, \u201cwe would more than likely have deployed deadly force and moved on,\u201d Chief Thomson said. The chief said he had stressed to his officers that the department \u201cdoes not treat repositioning as retreating,\u201d and that backing up to put a car between a suspect and an officer \u201cis not an act of cowardice. \u201d Few videos like it have emerged in the annals of American policing. Another lifesaving initiative in Camden, actually a mandate, is for officers to drive gunshot victims to a hospital if waiting for an ambulance would cause a delay. The policy, known as \u201cscoop and go,\u201d was modeled after a longstanding Philadelphia policy. But in much of the country, officers view picking up victims as the ambulance crews\u2019 job. Sgt. Angel Nieves, 45, a   Camden officer, said the policy \u201cstunned\u201d him when it was put into effect in November 2015. He had been taught to \u201ckeep your distance  \u2014   you don\u2019t know what these guys have,\u201d alluding to H. I. V. Then he thought of \u201cwhat happened in places like Ferguson,\u201d where officers had left Mr. Brown\u2019s body on the street, provoking outrage. \u201cIn light of what happened there,\u201d he said, \u201cany department that doesn\u2019t go with a \u2018scoop and go\u2019 policy is just asking for it\u201d  \u2014   that is, asking for trouble. Chief Thomson, 45, who leads the department of 400 officers, is president of a prominent police research group and has emerged as a significant voice in American policing. But he is an unlikely reformer. A Camden officer since 1994, he became chief in 2008 mainly because he was next in a   line. The department had gone through five chiefs in five years. \u201cThey looked at me and said, \u2018Well, he looks like he won\u2019t get indicted in the next six months  \u2014   he\u2019ll do,\u201d Chief Thomson recalled. The force was, he said, \u201capathetic, lethargic and corrupt,\u201d and yet still the \u201cmost effective government agency in Camden. \u201d The city, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, was once a manufacturing powerhouse  \u2014   this is where Campbell\u2019s invented condensed soup in a can and where RCA built many of the nation\u2019s first television sets. But the city fell into a long decline. Today there are glimmers of optimism. The Philadelphia 76ers opened a training facility here, and a few major companies are moving to Camden. But it is still a contender for the poorest and most dangerous city in America. Grandmothers warn children, \u201cPlay in the streets, die in the streets. \u201d The streets are not meant as a metaphor. Just being outside is considered dangerous. A Roman Catholic nun in Camden, Sister Helen Cole of Guadalupe Family Services, a social services agency, periodically hears from suburban friends offering to donate bicycles. \u201cI don\u2019t take them, because our kids in this community, they will not ride bikes outside,\u201d she said. The number of homicides in Camden has dropped significantly since 2012, when the city recorded 67, the most on record last year, the total was 44. In 2013, the remnants of the Camden force  \u2014   half had been laid off  \u2014   were disbanded. A new department was formed, again with Chief Thomson at its helm. It was a maneuver that lowered salaries and pension obligations. It allowed the chief to bring on new officers and a new culture. The improvements in public safety since then are particularly strong in North Camden, a neighborhood 10 blocks long and about that many wide, full of   homes, many long abandoned. Addicts from the suburbs often drove there to buy heroin from street dealers. In 2013, police officers were sent to walk patrols in the neighborhood for 12 hours. They were told to knock on doors and introduce themselves. If they needed to use a bathroom, they had better make some friends. The city razed abandoned homes. Drug dealers were arrested or pushed indoors or out of the neighborhood. Initially, at least, residents were discouraged from congregating outdoors. In interviews, several residents who had been stopped by the police, or even arrested, grudgingly conceded that things were better. \u201cMetro came out beasting  \u2014   they locked everybody up,\u201d recalled Tee Tee Nobles, 28. Since then, however, he has felt it safe enough to let his daughters, ages 8 and 2, run around outdoors. Before, he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t let them outside. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628547.3247993}
