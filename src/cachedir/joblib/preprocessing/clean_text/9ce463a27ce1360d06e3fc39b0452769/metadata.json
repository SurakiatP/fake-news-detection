Bush lost. Chavez remained and got the country\u2019s gold back. All 144 tons. He died after a massive looting of the private enterprises. His daughter ended up being worth $4.5 billion and Chavez set in motion the process of systemic destruction of the country. Maduro now has the country in a death spiral, is selling off the gold to Citibank to pay the bills and just announced that the newest currency will would be 200 times more than the largest bill now in circulation. That bill will be 20,000 bolivars. Black market value is $13 USD Currency controls are now in place with limits on ATM withdrawals. IMF estimates inflation of 1600% next year, 2900% in 2018 and 3500% in 2019. Those are low because IMF is wrong on any calculations like this \\nSo what\u2019s with precious metals in Venezuela? Silver and gold go a long way to purchasing power but the consumer finds no goods on the shelves.
