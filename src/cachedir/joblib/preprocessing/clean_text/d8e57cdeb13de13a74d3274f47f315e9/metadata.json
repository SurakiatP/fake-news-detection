And if we kick them all out you\u2019ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts,\u201d Streep said Sunday. White told TMZ Sports Monday, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be everybody\u2019s thing and the last thing in the world I expect is an uppity,   old lady to be in our demographic and love mixed martial arts. \u201d \u201cIf you really look at who follows the UFC and is into mixed martial arts, it\u2019s everybody,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t expect an   old woman to be a big fan of mixed martial arts and listen, everybody\u2019s into whatever  \u2014   I\u2019m not a big fan of golf. It doesn\u2019t mean people should stop watching it. If you don\u2019t like it, change the channel. \u201d As far as foreigners go, White pointed to his fighters from all over the world and fights that take place in different countries to show how uneducated the comment was. \u201cWe have fighters from all over the world,\u201d White said. \u201cWorld champions, men and women, we do fights in tons foreign countries. She\u2019s not educated about the sport and it was a completely uneducated comment. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742561890.2367115}
