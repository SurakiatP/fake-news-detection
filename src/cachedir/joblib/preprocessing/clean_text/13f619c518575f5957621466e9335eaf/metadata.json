Water. Sacred burial grounds. Grandmother Earth. \\nOpponents site potential environmental risks to water resources like the Missouri and Mississippi rivers to defend their stance against the 1,172-mile long pipeline, which would have the capacity to transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the Bakken oilfields of North Dakota to markets across the U.S. \\nWhat many ignore, however, is another facet of the #NoDAPL [2] movement: Native sovereignty. \\nMost of the confrontations between water protectors and law enforcement are occurring near the Standing Rock Reservation. The reservation currently takes up roughly 3,625 square miles [3] across southeastern North Dakota and into South Dakota. More than 8,000 people [4] live in scattered communities, all connected by a common history\u2014one which includes land theft and treaty violations. \\nThe construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline has brought this history to the current day. \u201cOur standoff is on treaty land, so we have every right to defend what is rightfully ours,\u201d says Cody Hall, a Lakota civil rights activist with the Cheyenne River Tribe who has spent time on the frontlines in North Dakota. \\nWhen he speaks of \u201ctreaty land,\u201d he\u2019s referring to land allotted to the Great Sioux Nation by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851 and 1868. \\n\u201cOur standoff is on treaty land, so we have every right to defend what is rightfully ours.\u201d \\nThe revised treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation in 1868, which the federal governement would eventually shrink to what became the Standing Rock Reservation. The treaty land crisscrossed between seven present-day states\u2014North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana\u2014including the reservation and unceded territories reserved for hunting. \\nThese boundaries were created to ensure peace between Native people and colonizers. The temptations of gold, however, meant that travelers were soon in tribal territory. Almost immediately after its conception in 1851, the U.S. violated the treaty by not policing its citizens\\' entry onto Native land. \\nFor Native Americans, treaties function as the law of the land. Article VI of the U.S. Constitution clearly states: \\nThis Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. \\nThe U.S. government would honor treaties\u2014until they interfered with Manifest Destiny. \u201cIt was all about colonial expansion,\u201d says Frank Pommersheim, a professor at the University of South Dakota School of Law who specializes in Indian law. In 1877, without consent from the Sioux, the United States stole their sacred Black Hills. The land was the center of their world, their birthplace. \\nThis act set in stone U.S.-tribal relations. From then on, the United States slowly diminished the land it left for tribal peoples. By 1889, the Great Sioux Reservation became what it is today: 3,625 square miles tucked between North and South Dakota, stripped of ancestral burial grounds and lush buffalo populations with which the Sioux used to coexist. \\nIn 1903, fewer than 30 years after the Black Hills seizement, the Supreme Court ruled in Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock [5] that Congress may unilaterally break treaties between the U.S. and Native Americans using its plenary power. \u201cIt is unfortunately a part of American law. That basic precept is totally unacceptable to Native people in the context of treaties,\u201d Pommersheim explains. \"It is just a collision between cultures and different understandings and interpretation of what treaties actually mean.\" \\n\u201cAlmost immediately after its conception in 1851, the U.S. violated the treaty by not policing its citizens\\' entry onto Native land.\u201d \\nHe is correct that a vast number of Native Americans find this unacceptable. \\n\u201cTo us [these treaties] are very much still alive and a part of our everyday life,\u201d says Remi Bald Eagle, the intergovernmental affairs coordinator for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. \u201cWe still honor those treaties, and I know the chairman has said that he expects America to do the same.\u201d \\nAnd while the U.S. has violated said treaties over the past century, it\u2019s never declared the treaties null or void, Bald Eagle adds. \\nWith the Treaty of Fort Laramie in mind, water protectors opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline have tried to take action. On October 23, pipeline opponents declared eminent domain [6] over land owned by Energy Transfer, the company behind the pipeline, by citing the treaty. Joye Braun, an Indigenous Environmental Network organizer, said in a statement: \\nWe have never ceded this land. If DAPL can go through and claim eminent domain on landowners and Native peoples on their own land, then we as sovereign nations can then declare eminent domain on our own aboriginal homeland. We are here to protect the burial sites here. Highway 1806 has become the no surrender line. \\nThe Sacred Ground Camp had already existed for over a month with about 300 people camped out, but occupiers extended the camp on October 23 by creating three road blockades to prevent militarized law enforcement from entering. (This came just a day after police arrested roughly 127 water protectors [7] directly across the road from where private security for Energy Transfer had unleashed dogs [8] on activists one month earlier.) The camp also intended to halt construction where the remaining proposed pipeline route would connect with the Missouri River. \\nFour days after declaring eminent domain for the camp, on October 27, law enforcement from seven states arrived there fully equipped with riot gear, all-terrain vehicles, armored vehicles and helicopters. They arrested 141 water protectors [9]\u2014after beating them with batons and issuing pepper spray. Law enforcement ultimately destroyed the camp, along with its tipis and sweat lodges. \\n\u201cWe did everything in our power that we could do to defend our camp in a nonviolent approach,\u201d says Cody Hall of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. \u201cBecause the only way to really defend it would have became a violent approach because you\\'re meeting officers with a force of weaponry.\u201d \\n\u201cWe still honor those treaties, and I know the chairman has said that he expects America to do the same.\u201d \\nThere are now talks of using the treaty to legally regain land rights to end the pipeline\\'s construction, according to Hall and others on-site. There is a precedent for taking this approach: In May, the Lummi in Washington state called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reject a coal terminal permit on the premise that it would harm Lummi fishing grounds, which the federal government is legally mandated to protect per an 1855 treaty. The Lummi won [10]. No terminal was built, fishing grounds were not harmed and the treaty was honored. \\n\u201c[DAPL] brings to the surface all the issues dealing with treaties,\" says Bald Eagle. \"It brings up all the wrongdoings that have been happening in the past. The American government has repeatedly shoved all of their wrongdoings underneath the rug, and the issue with the Dakota Access Pipeline has pulled that rug off, and now we have to look at everything that\u2019s been done wrong.\u201d \\nHe lays out three choices for the U.S. government: correct its wrongs, put the rug back or commit another wrong. \\nPresident Barack Obama [11], when interviewed by social media news site NowThis, stated that the Corps is figuring out [12] how to reroute the pipeline over the next several weeks, saying, \"There is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans.\" But construction has nearly reached the Missouri River, sacred water for the Sioux.
