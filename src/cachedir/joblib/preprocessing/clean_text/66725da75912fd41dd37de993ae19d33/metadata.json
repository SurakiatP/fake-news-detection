It\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye \u201cEleanor Rigby\u2026Lives in a dream/Waits at the window, wearing a face/That she keeps in a jar by the door/Who is it for?\u201d The Beatles, Eleanor Rigby Editor's Note The analogy of the mask and the role it plays in our lives provides fertile ground for discussion of this (endless) political season. That each of us plays some role in this farce (in the classic sense of that word) is an important recognition. More than any election in my lifetime I have heard \u201cyou can\u2019t make this shit up.\u201d A classic statement of life imitating art imitating fantastical life. Unfortunately, for many of us, myself included, this feels more like a nightmare from which I cannot wake myself. There is a world in the balance. One could say that there always in when dealing with a deck stacked with the arsenal of the United States. However, now we are dealing with an unfolding environmental catastrophe which will leave more dead than we can count. The new estimate from the World Wildlife Fund is that two-thirds of the world\u2019s wildlife will be extinct by 2020. That is less than 4 years. Those species deaths will certainly be accompanied by the decimation of countless human lives as well. So pick your stage and which play is real. T he idiocy of the Presidential election race will soon be over, as will the endless pseudo-debates and the droning of the commentators, who have been prattling on for more than a year, as if there were something to consider about this sick farce; as if the deep state had not been directing this life-movie from the start.\\nGore Vidal got a laugh when years ago he referred to Ronald Reagan as our \u201cacting president.\u201d But we\u2019ve had four acting presidents since and their acts have left millions dead and wounded around the globe, including thousands of American troops. Now we have the sordid spectacle of an election campaign that is so patently phony that \u201cdelusionary\u201d is the only word that can describe the thinking of those who take it seriously. Many Americans have acquiesced in this ongoing tragedy, playing their parts in this deadly charade. The ghosts of all America\u2019s victims walk among us, and they will haunt us until we come to life by admitting our own complicity in their deaths. The show must not go on, but it will, as long as we keep acting our parts. \\nNorman O. Brown so well describes our stage set: \u201cAncestral voices prophesying war; ancestral spirits in the danse macabre or war dance; Valhalla, ghostly warriors who kill each other and are reborn to fight again. All warfare is ghostly, every army an exercitus feralis (army of ghosts), every soldier a living corpse.\u201d \\nThe Obama administration repeatedly sets the stage by talking about and waging an endless war, a thirty year war, a long struggle, an open-ended war. Soon Obama\u2019s feral, war loving understudy, Hillary Clinton, will take center stage as he exits right, after promoting her. \u201cThis is not me going through the motions here,\u201d he recently said. \u201cI really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton.\u201d The role-playing, black face of empire will be replaced by the role-playing female face of empire as the audience cheers, hiding from their masked selves their part in a face-saving, phony performance. Without a complicit audience, the performance can\u2019t go on. But it does, or, as Kurt Vonnegut put it, \u201cso it goes.\u201d But the act is wearing thin. \\nThe autumnal season and especially the Halloween weekend of ghosts, the dead, and masks has me thinking of my own experience with acting, and how understanding the nature of our complicity in a mass act of bad faith is so important. \\nHaving grown up as the only brother among seven sisters, I was always my parents\u2019 favorite son. With such dumb luck, I never felt the need to be someone I wasn\u2019t and so accepted my favored fate. But from an early age I learned from my sisters what it meant to \u201cput on your face.\u201d Like most girls in a cosmetic culture, they would stand or sit in front of a mirror dutifully applying lipstick, cover-up, and mascara (Italian, maschera , mask) in preparation for their entrances onto the social stage where they would face so many other faces facing and eyeing them. Mirrors meeting mirrors, looking-glass selves. It seemed to the boy I was, such an exhausting act. \\nAt the time I had only a dim awareness of life the movie. \\nThen, when I was a young teenager, I had the great opportunity to learn how to be a public phony and put on a face. I got to lie to a national television audience and got paid for my deception. The show was a very popular one \u2013 To Tell the Truth \u2013 one of many game shows my parents, sisters, and I appeared on. We were a \u201ctheatrical\u201d family, not trained actors, but a brood of faces unconsciously hoping to discover who they were through their acts. My parents had started this by accepting an invitation to appear on a show hosted by Johnny Carson, Do You Trust Your Wife? (The show was later renamed Who Do You Trust? \u2013 an apt, albeit grammatically incorrect, appellation for the paranoid Cold War years.) But I didn\u2019t then care about politics; I just wanted to put on a good face and lie well while ostensibly telling the truth. I succeeded by convincing two of the celebrity panelists that I was who I wasn\u2019t \u2013 Robert McGee \u2013 and getting paid $250 for my act. Lying seemed so easy; all you needed was a good mask and a convincing demeanor. This was my public lesson in \u201cputting on your face.\u201d \\nEver since then, I\u2019ve been fascinated by masks, liars, and the role of acting on the social stage. Ghosts of the Past by Ian Kath. \\nAs the Halloween weekend transpires, this enchantment increases. I think of how all persons are, by definition, masked, the word \u2018person\u2019 being derived from the Latin, persona, meaning mask. Another Latin word, larva, occurs to me, it too meaning mask, ghost, or evil spirit. The living masks light up for me as I think of ghosts, the dead, all the souls and spirits circulating through our days. While etymology might seem arcane, I rather think it offers us a portal into our lives, not just personally, but politically and culturally as well. Shakespeare was right, of course, \u201call the world\u2019s a stage,\u201d though I would disagree with the bard that we are \u201cmerely\u201d players. It does often seem that way, but seeming is the essence of the actor\u2019s show and tell. But who are we behind the masks? Who is it uttering those words coming through the masks\u2019 mouth holes (the per-sona , Latin, to sound through). \\nHalloween. The children play at scaring and being scared. Death walks among them and they scream with glee. The play is on. The grim reaper walks up and down the street. Treats greet them. The costumes are ingenious; the masks, wild. The parents stand behind, watching, smiling. It\u2019s all great fun, the candy sweet. So what\u2019s the trick? When does the performance end? \\nAs Halloween ends, the saints come marching in followed by all the souls. The Days of the Dead. Spirits. Ghosts walk the streets. Dead leaves fall. The dead are everywhere, swirling through the air, drifting. We are surrounded by them. We are them. Until. \\nUntil when? Perhaps not until we dead awaken and see through the charade of social life and realize the masked performers are not just the deadly politicians and celebrities, not only the professional actors and the corporate media performers, but us. \\nLying is the leading cause of living death in the United States, and the pharmaceutical companies have no prescription for this one. Not yet, anyway, as far as I care to know. \\nIt seems to me that Albert Camus was right, and that we should aspire to be neither victims nor executioners. To do so will take a serious reevaluation of the roles we play in the ongoing national tragedy of lie piled upon lie in aggressive wars around the world and in election farces that perpetuate them. The leading actors we elect are our responsibility. We produce and maintain them. They are our mirror images; we, theirs. It is the danse macabre , a last tango in the land of bad actors, our two-faced show. This masquerade ball that passes for political reality is infiltrated by the ghosts of all those victims we have murdered around the wide world. We may choose not to see them, but they are lurking in the shadowy corners. And they will haunt us until we make amends. \\n\u201cDo you not know there comes a midnight hour when everyone has to throw off his mask?\u201d warned Kierkegaard, \u201cDo you believe that life will always let itself be mocked? Do you think you can slip away a little before midnight in order to avoid this? Or are you not terrified by it?\u201d \\n\u201cWhenever I take up a newspaper,\u201d Ibsen added, \u201cI seem to see ghosts gliding between the lines. There must be ghosts all the country over, as thick as the sands of the sea. And then we are, one and all, so pitifully afraid of the light.\u201d \\n\\nEdward Curtin is a writer and sociologist.
