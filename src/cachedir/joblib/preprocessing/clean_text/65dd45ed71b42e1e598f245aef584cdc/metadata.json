[\u201cWe\u2019re going to do repeal and replace,\u201d he said. \u201cVery complicated stuff. And we\u2019re going to get a health bill passed we\u2019re going to get health care taken care of in this country. \u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re going to be very, very proud as not only the media and reporters, you\u2019re going to be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care,\u201d Trump said to reporters during a press conference. He adds: Obamacare is a complete and total disaster. They can say what they want. They can guide you any way they want to guide you, and, in some cases, they guide you incorrectly. In most cases, you realize what\u2019s happened  \u2014   it\u2019s imploding. As we said, some states have over a hundred percent increase, and \u201817  \u2014   and I said this two years ago  \u2014   \u201917 is going to be the bad year. It\u2019s going to be catastrophic. Trump said that while politically his team could \u201csit back, and wait, and watch, and criticize, and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it,\u201d but ultimately, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people. \u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want to own it, politically,\u201d he said. \u201cThey own it right now. So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in \u201917 and, believe me, we\u2019d get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. \u201d Trump said that, as soon as Rep. Tom Price is approved as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, his administration would be submitting, \u201cessentially simultaneously,\u201d a proposal to repeal and replace. Trump said Obamacare\u2019s deductibles are \u201cso high\u201d that \u201cpeople go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof. \u201d \u201cObamacare is the Democrats\u2019 problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take the problem off the shelves for them. We\u2019re doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742561802.6718647}
