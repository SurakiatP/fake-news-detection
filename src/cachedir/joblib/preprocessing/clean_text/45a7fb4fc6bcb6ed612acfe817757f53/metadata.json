Just ask the Pentagon, which has 10 big   supercarriers that it uses around the world to protect air and sea lanes and to mount airstrikes. There\u2019s generally at least one of them stationed near the Middle East at all times. So, as other countries join in military action against extremists in the world\u2019s hot spots, can\u2019t they send their own carriers into action? Well, they could if they had any. But, aside from the 10 American giants, there\u2019s currently only one big carrier in the whole world that can handle such a job  \u2014   and it doesn\u2019t belong to Britain, Russia or even China. It\u2019s the Charles de Gaulle, the flagship and pride of the French Navy, and it\u2019s been sent several times to join the fight against the Islamic State in Syria and in Libya. The carrier\u2019s strike group performed so well in pounding the militants in the region that the United States Navy awarded it a Meritorious Unit Commendation in June. And President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France announced on July 13 that the Charles de Gaulle would be redeployed to the Middle East this fall. Though it is   the Charles de Gaulle isn\u2019t quite a supercarrier  \u2014   it\u2019s shorter and much lighter, and doesn\u2019t pack the same punch. But neither does it rate down among the small escort carriers and helicopter carriers that a number of navies employ. It is considered a   fleet carrier, and these days, it has that category practically to itself. Russia has the Admiral Kuznetsov, but that ship has been plagued with mechanical problems and doesn\u2019t leave port often, though there are reports that it will operate in the eastern Mediterranean in the autumn. A partially completed sister carrier was sold to China, but it has yet to complete trials. India has an older Russian castoff that rarely sails, and Brazil\u2019s      fleet carrier, the S\u00e3o Paulo, is being refitted. Britain, which got out of the fleet carrier game years ago for cost reasons, is getting back in: A newly built carrier, which is larger than the Charles de Gaulle, is expected to be commissioned next year. Another will follow several years after that.'"}, "time": 1742562705.5568466}
