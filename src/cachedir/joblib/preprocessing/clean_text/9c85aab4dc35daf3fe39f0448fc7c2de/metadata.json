Maeril, who lives in France, originally designed it for bystanders wanting to make Muslim citizens feel welcome after the terror attacks in Paris and Nice, said on her Tumblr that the guide can actually be used to help those being targeted by various forms of hatred and racism. Maeril asked those planning on following the guide to make sure to do two things: \\n1) Do not, in any way, interact with the attacker. You must absolutely ignore them and focus entirely on the person being attacked! \\n2) Please make sure to always respect the wishes of the person you\u2019re helping: whether they want you to leave quickly afterwards, or not! If you\u2019re in a hurry escort them to a place where someone else can take over \u2014 call one of their friends, or one of yours, of if they want to, the police. It all depends on how they feel! \\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed News, Maeril said the guide is based on a psychological technique called \u201cNon-complementary behavior,\u201d in which a person adopts the polar opposite behavior of someone else. In this instance, non-complementary behavior means acting in a warm and friendly way toward someone who is experiencing hostile behavior from someone else. \\nThis guide will likely become essential over the next four years as hate crimes are already being reported across the country in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election to the presidency.
