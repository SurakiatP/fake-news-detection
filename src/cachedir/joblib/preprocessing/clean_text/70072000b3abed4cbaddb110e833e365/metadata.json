Yesterday, FBI Comey issued a vaguely worded memo to Congressional Republicans about an email loosely linked toHillary Clinton, which House Republican Jason Chaffetz quickly used to punk the media on Twitter, leading to a swirl of false stories about Clinton and emails \u2014 most of which required corrections. \\nThe Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Special Counsel is in charge of enforcing Hatch Act violations when federal employees like FBI Director Comey abuse their offices for political reasons. That\u2019s where DCAT sent their harshly worded complaint: \u201cThis is an election year, and we are just 11 days away from the date that the American public votes to choose the next President of the United States, I am writing to ask that an investigation be opened into Director Comey for any potential violations of the Hatch Act. The timing of this announcement, accompanied by the vague facts of the investigation, seems as if Director Comey was making a political move, and not a professional one.\u201d [text of complaint]   filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBI\u2019s decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. \u201cIt is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,\u201d said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. \u201c It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.\u201d Most federal employees are prohibited from engaging in partisan electioneering under federal law by \u201c An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities,\u201d otherwise known as the Hatch Act. It makes very narrow exceptions for partisan campaigning by the President, Vice President and a few designated high-ranking members of the Executive Branch of government. The FBI\u2019s Director is not one of those exempt positions, and former Bush appointee James Comey\u2019s vaguely worded memo to Congress reeks of partisan political interference to help fellow desperate Republicans at the end of a hotly contested general election.'"}, "time": 1742561836.6772873}
