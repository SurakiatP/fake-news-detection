[Crackdowns on immigration or extremist ideology are not the way forward when it comes to terror prevention, according to the veteran journalist, writing after Friday\u2019s terror attack in Stockholm left four people dead.  Instead, it is cars  \u2014   which she calls \u201ceffective murder machines\u201d  \u2014   that Franchell says \u201cmust simply be removed from city centres and places where people gather, if people are to be protected in future\u201d. Vehicles are \u201ceasy to steal, and so nothing has been able to stop their advance\u201d writes Ms. Franchell. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t reasonable that a big truck can be driven right into one of Stockholm\u2019s busiest streets on a Friday afternoon right before Easter. \u201d Noting how it is a popular destination for tourists, Franchell says the city centre must be a \u201csafe environment\u201d for visitors to enjoy. She described it as \u201cremarkable\u201d that it is possible to drive around the Swedish capital\u2019s medieval old town. Outlining her vision for a   Stockholm, she argues: \u201cMost problems with regards to mobility and public transport can be solved, and deliveries to shops and restaurants could take place at times when people aren\u2019t out on the streets. \u201d \u201cVehicles have been allowed to dominate our cities for decades and it\u2019s the people who need space. It\u2019s vital now that cars be regulated,\u201d the piece concludes. The idea of reducing the number of cars in Swedish cities was backed last month by Sweden\u2019s environment minister, who argued that driving is a gender equality issue as well as a matter of shrinking the nation\u2019s carbon emissions. \u201cCars are driven largely by men so by giving a lot of space to cars we\u2019re giving a lot of space to men  \u2014   at the expense of women,\u201d Karolina Skog explained.'"}, "time": 1742563340.1104548}
