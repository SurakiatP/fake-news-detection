Schiff: US Doesn't Want to Provoke Retaliation Before Vote by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This \\nWhile the Obama Administration has made much of its intention to start a full-scale cyberwar against Russia at a \u201ctime of their choosing,\u201d the most recent reports suggest that the war is effectively on hold at least until the presidential election in two weeks. \\nFrom President Obama\u2019s standpoint, the hope is to work with Hillary Clinton, if she becomes president-elect, to launch a cyber war that they both can get behind. Indeed, both have appeared very hawkish against Russia, and Obama apparently doesn\u2019t want to deny Clinton a chance to participate in the early days of a war she\u2019d inherit. \\nStarting a cyberwar ahead of a Trump win would be even less wise, as Trump has opposed the idea of picking fights with Russia, and expressed strong doubts about Democratic Party \u201ccertainty\u201d that Russia is behind hacks against them. \\nRep. Adam Schiff (D \u2013 CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says that another factor is concern about provoking Russian retaliation for such a US attack before the vote, with many Democrats concerned Russia could release \u201cforged\u201d documents to embarrass the Clinton campaign. \\nEarlier this month, Vice President Joe Biden reported that he has informed Russia of an imminent retaliatory hack, and says the Obama Administration will pick a time which will \u201chave the greatest impact.\u201d Russia has denied any involvement in the hacks.
