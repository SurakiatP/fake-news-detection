I personally won\u2019t be going near a hospital until April at the earliest\u201d. \\nHarris went on to add that if a member of the public should see a patient dying in a hospital, to try and give them a saucer of sugary water or something. \\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t hurt\u201d, said Harris.'"}, "time": 1742562767.3486643}
