For his first Supreme Court nomination, he selected Neil M. Gorsuch, a conservative judge with a sterling r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I spent the night in the studio talking with some of my most insightful New York Times colleagues about what it means. Maggie Haberman, a White House reporter, explains Mr. Trump\u2019s reverence for the Supreme Court. Carl Hulse, the dean of congressional reporters, explains what to expect during the confirmation process. And Adam Liptak, our chief legal correspondent, introduces the country\u2019s new Supreme Court nominee. To understand more about Judge Gorsuch, I also talk to David Green, the chief executive of Hobby Lobby, a company at the center of one of Judge Gorsuch\u2019s most important cases. He ruled that corporations with religious owners  \u2014   like Hobby Lobby  \u2014   cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage for contraception. \u201cWe voted for Trump, not that we agree with everything he does,\u201d Mr. Green tells me on the show, speaking for himself and his wife. \u201cThe most important thing to us was the fact that we knew he would put someone there that ruled on the Constitution,\u201d he said, referring to the Supreme Court. \u201cBecause if you rule on the Constitution, it would be obvious that we would not have to be forced to do something, and that we would have our religious liberties. \u201d Tune in, and tell us what you think.
