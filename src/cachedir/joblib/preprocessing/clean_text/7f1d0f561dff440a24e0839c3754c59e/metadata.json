Tillerson, the new secretary of state, offered the diplomatic understatement of the month on Saturday when he told the sole reporter he permitted on his airplane: \u201cI\u2019m not a big media press access person. I personally don\u2019t need it. \u201d Perhaps, by breaking with a   of past practice and flying off without the regular State Department correspondents on board, Mr. Tillerson was hoping to continue to operate in a style that worked well for him as chief executive of Exxon Mobil. In that job, he could negotiate complex oil and gas deals behind closed doors and then inform his board of directors and shareholders afterward. Certainly, his predecessors at the State Department have all wished for more time, space and secrecy to work through some of the world\u2019s knottiest problems. The North Korea crisis that dominated this trip is a prime example of one that, if mishandled, could easily veer into war. Yet long experience teaches that foreign policy is rarely made in the kind of   bubble that Mr. Tillerson wants. Maybe John Hay had that luxury as secretary of state under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, when the United States was just emerging as a global power. But in the modern era, everyone from Dean Acheson to John Kerry has found that superpower diplomacy abhors a news vacuum. When America\u2019s top diplomats create one, adversaries and allies usually fill it with their own narrative of events, their own proposals, their own accounts of encounters with Washington. Sure, there have occasionally been secret deals  \u2014   Henry Kissinger\u2019s mission to China when he was President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, for example  \u2014   but they are rare. And American diplomats generally have little luck presenting the world with faits accompli. Both at home and abroad, public diplomacy is about persuading the world that a particular solution is in the global interest, not just the American interest. And that often means building an argument while the diplomacy is in progress, or else risking a loss of influence and control of the narrative. That, and ego, are usually what make a secretary of state a \u201cmedia press access person. \u201d Mr. Tillerson got a brief taste of this reality even before beginning his somewhat rocky first outing in Asia. China tried to box him in by reviving an old proposal for a \u201cfreeze\u201d of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs in return for an   freeze of all military exercises with South Korea. It is one of those ideas that sound eminently sensible at first hearing. Who would oppose a diplomatic timeout for North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests, which are escalating toward demonstration of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could splash down off Seattle or Los Angeles? After all, that\u2019s how diplomacy with Iran began six years ago, ultimately leading to a nuclear deal that, love it or hate it, took an apparently imminent military conflict and defused it for a decade or so. Doing something similar with North Korea is an idea that some American proliferation experts embrace as the   option on a menu of nothing but bad options. At a brief news conference in Seoul, Mr. Tillerson did use the words \u201cimminent threat\u201d to describe the North Korean program, and accurately noted that a freeze \u201cwould leave North Korea with significant capabilities that would represent a true threat, not just to the region, but to American forces. \u201d But other than that, he never grappled   with the Chinese arguments in favor of their proposal  \u2014   which left the door open for his Chinese counterpart to restate his case in Beijing. As a senior South Korean official told me after Mr. Tillerson\u2019s meeting, \u201cthere are South Korean politicians\u201d  \u2014   including one or two who could become president after a snap election next month  \u2014   \u201cwho may find the Chinese approach preferable to the risk of a conflict. \u201d The Chinese example here is a small one, but it is telling. In past administrations, the State Department would have used the long flight to Asia to give reporters a sense of its arguments and   strategy. The secretary of state would have wandered back to the press seats on the plane and offered, on \u201cbackground,\u201d the administration\u2019s thinking about the major issue of the day. Mr. Kissinger was a master of this spin James A. Baker III, Colin L. Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton were no novices, either. And often, it is more than spin: It is a way for the secretary to test whether an idea has a   longer than the plane ride. \u201cIt\u2019s not about access. It\u2019s about context,\u201d John Kirby, who has served as spokesman for both the Pentagon and the State Department and is considered one of the best at navigating the process, wrote on Twitter in response to Mr. Tillerson\u2019s declarations. Mr. Kirby is right: The most important paragraphs in most articles about diplomatic news are the explanatory ones that lay out the administration\u2019s strategy and assess whether it is tenable in light of history, or the facts on the ground, or other realities that the secretary of state may not want to discuss. As Mr. Kirby himself has noted, State Department correspondents work a bit differently from those at the White House. They do not often shout their questions, and television cameras are absent from many of the most important briefings. \u201cMany have covered the beat for decades,\u201d he noted over the weekend. \u201cThey know the complexities, the history. \u201d (Not all of us took the \u201cdecades\u201d part as a compliment.) The group that has covered the State Department is heavy with former foreign correspondents and war correspondents who have lived around the world, have sources in foreign capitals and write books about the global challenges the country faces. Their   conversations have been known to run to wonkish topics like deterrence theory. So it might not be surprising that Mr. Tillerson doesn\u2019t want them in the back of his airplane, talking to his staff and probing how the new administration\u2019s approach to North Korea and China might differ from what predecessors tried. As he said in that interview with the one journalist he brought along  \u2014   a reporter from the Independent Journal Review, a   website that had never covered a State Department trip before  \u2014   Mr. Tillerson has something more   in mind. \u201cI view that relationship that I want to have with the media, is the media is very important to help me communicate not just to the American people, but to others in the world that are listening,\u201d Mr. Tillerson was quoted as saying. \u201cAnd when I have something important and useful to say, I know where everybody is, and I know how to go out there and say it. \u201d There is something to be said for his approach. Clearly, Mr. Tillerson wants to shake up the foreign policy elite, and that starts with a press corps that feeds in the very swamp this administration says it wants to drain. He also says he is saving money by using a smaller plane (though news organizations pay steeply for each employee who flies with the secretary). This early in Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure, many policy decisions have not yet been debated thoroughly within his administration, so as Mr. Tillerson noted on Saturday, there is not much for him to say. And there would be considerable risk in getting out ahead of his sometimes mercurial boss. (That boss, Mr. Tillerson conceded, went ahead and posted a Twitter message complaining that \u201cChina has done little to help!\u201d without running it past him first.) Yet there is something else that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s policy forgoes: the often useful symbolism of top American officials\u2019 being seen to travel with a free and intrusive press asking questions that leaders do not want to hear. When Mr. Kerry was in Bahrain last year, the visit gave the State Department press corps a chance to publicly interrogate his very uncomfortable Bahraini counterpart about some specific human rights abuses in the country. (\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked that,\u201d Mr. Kerry told correspondents later on his plane, making it clear that he knew local reporters could not have done so.) When President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt barred the State Department press pool last year, the State Department itself lodged an objection. None of those considerations mattered much when Mr. Tillerson traveled on behalf of the world\u2019s largest oil company. As he said, he personally did not need reporters then, and he doesn\u2019t now. But as secretary of state, he now has 320 million shareholders, and many of them have a stake in how he conducts America\u2019s    business around the world.'"}, "time": 1742562014.62669}
