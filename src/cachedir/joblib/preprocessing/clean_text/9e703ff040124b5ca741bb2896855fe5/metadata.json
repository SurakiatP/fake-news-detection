Bodies of water that will be used for Olympic competitions are polluted, and global public health officials are trying to tamp down the Zika virus epidemic. With less than 100 days before the Olympic Games come to South America for the first time, Rio de Janeiro faces more than the usual challenges that bedevil host cities, like delayed stadium construction and transportation concerns. (Rio has those, too.) The mood here, however, is hardly one of panic. Officials in charge of executing the Summer Games say they feel insulated from Brazil\u2019s turmoil at this late stage. The Olympics, after all, tend to exist in their own bubble, elaborately coordinated to ensure that the   operation goes off smoothly. \u201cThe machine is in place, and it\u2019s relatively stable,\u201d Ricardo Leyser, Brazil\u2019s sports minister, said in an interview this week. \u201cMy biggest concern isn\u2019t any individual issue. It\u2019s the small demands that all come at once. \u201d Local organizers are beginning to lay colorful comforters  \u2014   patterned with the silhouettes of cartoon cyclists, fencers and swimmers  \u2014   on the twin beds in the athletes\u2019 village. They are monitoring the growth of    grass that will be transplanted to Maracan\u00e3, the storied soccer stadium that will also be used for the opening and closing ceremonies. They are pulling trash from Guanabara Bay, where the Games\u2019 sailing events will be held mopping up standing water to minimize mosquito breeding and ramping up a    security operation  \u2014   all while publicly expressing little worry about the unrest encircling them. On Wednesday, with the handoff of the Olympic flame in Greece and the start of a journey that in little more than a week will bring it to Brazil, the official countdown to the Aug. 5 opening ceremony began. In Rio, the race to be ready is intensifying, with construction workers here still laboring on mass transit projects that were key promises seven years ago in the city\u2019s bid to host the Games. Costing several billion dollars, those projects include a new subway line and express bus lanes that connect the Olympic Park in Barra da Tijuca to the rest of the city, which is expected to swell with more than half a million visitors. As the value of the Brazilian real has drastically declined over the last year, some have expressed doubt that the transit projects will materialize beyond the sleek, modernist weather shelters that have been built at various stations. At a news conference Wednesday, the city\u2019s secretary of transportation said the new routes would be ready in time but did not specify when. To the vast majority of people watching the Games on television, however, such infrastructure may not matter. The permanent venues for competitions here are mostly complete  \u2014   all but those for tennis and track cycling  \u2014   and athletes from around the world have competed in dozens of test events in Rio in recent months. \u201cIt\u2019s about the filling of the cake,\u201d Mr. Leyser said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the stadiums it\u2019s about the scoreboards. \u201d As of the latest counts, 62 percent of the 5. 7 million tickets on the market had been sold  \u2014   roughly half of the total tickets for the Olympics  \u2014   and 24 percent of tickets available for the Paralympics had been sold. But compared with past Olympics, the buyers of those tickets may be disproportionately international, said Andrew Parsons, the president of the Brazilian Paralympic Committee. For some Brazilians, the country\u2019s political and economic crises have cast a shadow on the celebration. President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s ouster looks increasingly likely amid a sweeping graft scandal, and those in line to succeed her have their own controversies hanging over them. Questions of corruption have extended to Olympics planning, particularly after a businessman who worked on many Olympic projects in Rio was convicted of corruption and money laundering related to separate contracts. Mr. Leyser said that the questions centered on irregularities at the Deodoro event site and that no public official had been accused of wrongdoing. \u201cIt\u2019s more an administrative issue than a corruption scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a question of the numbers. \u201d Mr. Leyser called the devaluation of Brazil\u2019s currency an opportunity because it increases the buying power of foreign money coming into Brazil for the Games. But not everyone sees the event as a boon to the country. Shirlei Alves, who lives in the Santa Marta favela of Rio, criticized the government for spending on the Olympics in the face of Brazil\u2019s problems. \u201cThe world is just getting worse here,\u201d Ms. Alves said, noting that she was without medication and electricity. \u201cThe government is making a mistake. I\u2019d like if they\u2019d take a better look at the poor people and not help people who are already rich. \u201d Eduardo Paes, the mayor of Rio, said Wednesday that the city had a \u201ccomfortable financial situation\u201d and had spent on stadium construction 1 percent of what it spent on health education. \u201cI know people are skeptical,\u201d Mr. Paes said, citing the \u201chuge deliverables\u201d for the Olympics. \u201cOf course the situation here has been difficult. But there is a commitment of the Brazilian state to deliver the Olympics. \u201d Perhaps the most vexing issue for local organizers  \u2014   the one that may stir anxiety among athletes and spectators  \u2014   is the   Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects and temporary paralysis. Zika is of greater concern outside Rio, in the far north part of Brazil, but the World Health Organization has declared the virus a global public health emergency and has advised pregnant women not to travel anywhere in Brazil. \u201cThe Olympics is a pretty effective way of taking whatever disease is local and making it global,\u201d said Ashish K. Jha, director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard. Some scientists have suggested that by the time the Olympics start in August  \u2014   wintertime in Brazil, when mosquitoes are less numerous  \u2014   the virus might be more prevalent in the southern United States. \u201cZika\u2019s been spreading effectively on its own, but there\u2019s very good reason to think the Olympics will accelerate the spread,\u201d Dr. Jha said. But the virus poses a unique problem because it is so far beyond the control of local organizing officials, and so many questions about it remain unanswered. Few athletes have publicly expressed concern, but it is unclear how many might withdraw as the Games draw closer. \u201cAt this point you just keep going,\u201d David Wallechinsky, an Olympics historian, said. \u201cYou have to continue as if everything\u2019s going to be fine. These are real concerns  \u2014   Zika, the water quality. But even if Dilma is forced out of office, it\u2019s not going to stop the Olympics. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562095.2714942}
