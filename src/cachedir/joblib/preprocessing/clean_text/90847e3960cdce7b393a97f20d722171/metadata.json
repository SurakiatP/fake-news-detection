Wilson ( OR Books ) \\nEditor\u2019s note: The following is an excerpt from \u201cTrump Unveiled: Exposing the Bigoted Billionaire,\u201d by John K. Wilson. \u201cTrump Unveiled\u201d is published by OR Books. Click here for details. \\nWith his casino background, Trump is an expert at attracting gamblers, people who are willing to throw the dice with the irrational hope it will make their lives better. Trump understands how to recruit gamblers\u2014by evoking hope and concealing facts. A casino doesn\u2019t tell you that you\u2019re likely to lose; a casino tells you that anything can happen, and you might just win, and what the hell, you\u2019ll have some fun along the way. That\u2019s the appeal of Trump\u2019s campaign: take a chance on me, and I\u2019ll give you everything. \\nIn fact, Trump literally promised \u201ceverything\u201d to his followers. Trump promised workers in Michigan, \u201cI\u2019ll get you a new job; don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d If the cost of supporting Trump is so small (a mere vote) and the potential economic benefits are so great (a new job, economic prosperity, and global dominance), why not go for Trump? Trump is the cheapest lottery ticket you\u2019ll ever buy. And even if the odds that he\u2019ll keep his word are very small, why not take a gamble on Trump? \\nThis explains why Trump is so committed to denouncing America. He claims (despite all the evidence to the contrary) that the economy is a disaster, that the unemployment rate is really 42 percent, that everything is terrible, and that only he can make America great again. If you\u2019re trying to recruit a gambler, you need to make them feel like normal life is boring and miserable. Trump tells America that their lives are horrible, and even though it\u2019s factually not true for the overwhelming majority, they begin to wonder if he might be right. Everyone can imagine being richer and happier, and that\u2019s precisely the core appeal of gambling. \\nAs Trump the real estate developer put it: \u201cI play to people\u2019s fantasies. ... The more unattainable the apartments seemed, the more people wanted them.\u201d Trump is applying the same principles to politics: Trump is presenting a fantasy of what people want from a president, and the more unattainable and unrealistic his promises are, the more people will want him even if they know they are being irrational. \\nTrump\u2019s own lavish lifestyle serves his message. Trump loves to have rallies at airport hangers; it\u2019s not just the convenience of flying in and out quickly. The true appeal of it to Trump is that it reminds his audience how incredibly wealthy he is: he has a giant plane with his name on it. Trump is telling supporters, I\u2019ve got a plane. Do you? Vote for me, and who knows, maybe you will. Might Trump\u2019s ostentatious display of extreme wealth turn off potential voters who are angry at financial inequality and the rigged system that favors the rich? The opposite is true: Trump is telling them the system is rigged and they\u2019re right to be angry at the rich, but Trump is the only one who can offer the salvation of getting rich yourself. Trump University was another form of shafting suckers gambling on Trump. Give Trump thousands of dollars to learn his secrets, and maybe, just maybe, you\u2019ll get really rich, too. \\nTrump also understands that the best way to bring people to a casino is with a distraction, and the best kind of distraction is a fight. A big boxing match attracts crowds who stick around to toss some coin at the casino. And so Trump is always provoking fights: with his opponents, with protesters, with the media, with Twitter critics, with anyone and everyone who irritates him. Distraction is essential to any casino. You want bright lights and noisy machines, free drinks and sexy waitresses. You want fancy palaces with shimmering chandeliers. You want the customer paying attention to everything except the fact that it\u2019s all a giant, flashy scam. As the slogan of the Trump Taj Mahal says, \u201cExcitement Returns.\u201d Distractions make people more willing to gamble. In an environment of calm analysis, rational thinking tends to prevail. \\nTrump explained his approach to The Apprentice: \u201cI rant and rave like a lunatic and the crazier I am, the higher the ratings.\u201d This is also Trump\u2019s approach to his presidential campaign, because it is his way of life. \\nCasinos are a legal con. The gamblers always lose, collectively, and everyone knows that. But individuals can sometimes win. The key for any casino is to convince gamblers to imagine that they will be the exception to the odds. They don\u2019t even have to believe something so irrational is likely, they just have to hope. \\nTrump is gambling on the idea that he can convince the voters that the world they live in is a rigged game. They keep trying to play fair, and they get screwed. Trump is promising to play this rigged game, but says he will rig it on behalf of America. Nobody thinks Trump is an honest person; but the more he lies, the more his supporters can imagine that he\u2019s going to lie for us. He\u2019s going to be a lying son of a bitch, but he will be our lying son of a bitch. He\u2019s a con man working for us to take the rest of the world\u2019s money after they stole it from us. \\nThe trick of Trump\u2019s con is that he implicitly admits to being a con man. Trump\u2019s book, The Art of the Deal, could easily have been titled The Art of the Con. The book is full of examples of how Trump misleads (\u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d) and manipulates people to take advantage of them. Trump has bragged, \u201cI\u2019ve taken advantage of the banks probably more than any other human being on earth.\u201d To Trump, conning people is a credential. \\nAs a con artist, Trump believes in nothing but himself. Only a con artist could propose the largest tax increase on the wealthy in human history just a few years ago and now propose the largest tax cut on the wealthy in human history while simultaneously claiming that he\u2019s going to make the rich pay more. Trump will say anything to get elected. \\nTrump has only a few consistent positions he has held for decades. Because Trump is a con artist, he will never believe in free trade. The concept of mutually beneficial agreements is alien to him; someone is always taking advantage of someone else in Trump\u2019s world. You\u2019re either the con artist or the victim. \\nThe fact that Trump is a con artist does not mean he is plotting as president to steal a trillion dollars and run off to a remote island. Trump, after all, is a narcissist who dreams of being president and imagines himself the greatest leader in history. But Trump can never escape his con artist instincts. He is unable to change, and incapable of self-criticism. He will govern as a con artist, as someone who deceives and manipulates and seeks to control everything around him. As a con artist, Trump imagines that everyone is organizing a con as well, which leads to his conspiratorial thinking. Only the na\u00efve fail to understand they\u2019re the victim of a con. \\nCasting a vote is as easy as buying a lottery ticket, and it\u2019s free, too. Why not take a chance that Trump can deliver what he says, even if you know he can\u2019t? The odds are against you, but hope matters more than probabilities. As the Powerball ad slogan says, \u201canything\u2019s possible.\u201d \\nTrump once said, \u201cMy life is like a game of poker.\u201d As a gambler, Trump knows how to take risks with other people\u2019s money. But he shows a dangerous tendency to follow instinct rather than reason. The only hope for Trump to emerge victorious is if he can convince the American people to be the same kind of gambler he has been. \\nDonald Trump is a pathological liar, a sexist pig, a hateful racist, a corrupt businessman, a pandering populist, a conspiracy nut, and a vicious bully. Trump\u2019s cynical narcissism explains why he wants to be president, but his political success reflects much deeper problems in America: the inequality of wealth that makes a man like Trump so powerful, the celebrity-obsessed media that gave Trump an uncritical platform for his ideas, and the failure of our political system to address America\u2019s flaws, which has allowed a bigoted demagogue to seize control of the Republican Party.'"}, "time": 1742561717.1194298}
