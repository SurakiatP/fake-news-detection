Yet, he has become an unrelenting critic of one of its loudest descendants, the alt-right. He issued his sharpest critique to date on Friday\u2019s edition of \u201cThe Glenn Beck Program,\u201d saying that this white supremacist and Islamophobic movement represents a clear and present danger to this country\u2019s very existence. \\nDuring the first hour of Friday\u2019s show, Beck, a charter member of the \u201cNeverTrump\u201d movement, declared that the alt-right represented nothing less than a \u201cgrave threat to the republic.\u201d The alt-right, as many of you know, has rallied behind Donald Trump, and effectively took control of the Trump campaign when Breitbart chairman Stephen Bannon became campaign CEO. \\nBreitbart is widely reckoned as the main mouthpiece of the alt-right, and Bannon is the main architect of the effort to give the alt-right a place at the table on the wingnut fringe. has a very clear design for where he wants to take the alt-right after the campaign. Apparently it includes building closer ties between the alt-right and the rest of the wingnut fringe. He plans to speak at David Horowitz\u2019\u201cRestoration Weekend\u201d two days after the election. This gathering is a known hotspot for right-wing bile of the worst type. \\nHowever, Beck claimed, the alt-right would have likely blossomed without Trump. . @glennbeck : This has nothing to do with @realDonaldTrump or @HillaryClinton \u2026 it would be happening with someone like @tedcruz in as well. \\n\u2014 TheBlaze Radio (@TheBlazeRadio) October 28, 2016 \\nHow\u2019s that, you ask? Well, Beck argued, the American alt-right seems to be taking its cue from the European far right. Listen here. \\nBeck said that Bannon and the rest of the American alt-right think along the same lines as the far right in Europe\u2013\u201cburn the entire thing down, and out of the chaos, we will rise.\u201d He\u2019s apparently referring to an email exchange between Bannon and Breitbart reporter Matt Doyle from 2014, in which they discussed plans to \u201cturn on the hate\u201d in order to make it easier to \u201cburn this bitch down.\u201d He claimed that neither Trump nor even his most ardent supporters know this. \\nBeck was actually building on a Facebook post from Thursday night, in which he shared an article in the New York Observer\u2013ironically, owned by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner\u2013detailing the links between Russia and far-right elements in Europe. In a lengthy commentary on Facebook, Beck claimed that there are disturbing parallels between far-right tactics in Europe and the alt-right\u2019s tactics here in this country. Just like the European far right, the alt-right in this country is extremely fixated on \u201ccultural preservation and homogenity.\u201d \\nHe also argued that the Kremlin may already be funding \u201cdangerous people\u201d in the United States. For that reason, Beck claimed, the alt-right is \u201ca great danger to the republic,\u201d and must be rooted out by true conservatives. He promised to do chalkboards on these links after the election, but was reluctant to do so now because \u201cright now it would be viewed as pro or anti C or T.\u201d \\nI never thought I\u2019d see the day that I would find myself agreeing with Beck. After all, as we\u2019ve seen already, Trump has more or less twiddled his thumbs while alt-right trolls acting on his behalf have brutally attacked and threatened anyone who dares speak out against him. Moreover, the alt-right has made no secret of its vicious anti-Semitism; they were the bottom-feeders behind \u201c echoes ,\u201d an attempt to flag Jewish-sounding names online. \\nBut if these people are \u201ca great danger to the republic,\u201d Glenn, why wait until after the election to tell us more? I suspect that Beck is afraid that he\u2019ll have to admit that he was the architect of most of the bile we saw from the tea party\u2013including its resistance to any form of compromise. That mentality seems to have passed on to the alt-right. Perhaps Beck himself hasn\u2019t seen it yet\u2013or doesn\u2019t want to see it. \\nStill, when the architect of the tea party sounds like a voice of sanity, there can no longer any doubt\u2013the GOP civil war is well under way. \\n( featured image courtesy Gage Skidmore, available under a Creative Commons BY-SA license) About Darrell Lucus \\nDarrell is a 30-something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school.
