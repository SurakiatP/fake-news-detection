Penguin Press announced today that Kurt Andersen and Alec Baldwin will team up to write \u201cYou Can\u2019t Spell America Without Me: The Really Tremendous Inside Story of My Fantastic First Year as President Donald J. Trump. \u201d The book is scheduled for publication in November. Mr. Baldwin (as President Trump) will read the audiobook version. Mr. Andersen is a novelist and the host of the public radio program \u201cStudio 360,\u201d but perhaps most relevant for this new project is his experience as a founding editor of the satirical Spy magazine in the 1980s. It was Spy that now famously referred to the future president as a \u201c  vulgarian. \u201d The real estate mogul was often in the magazine\u2019s cross hairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think this former hobby of mine would return with this ferocity,\u201d Mr. Andersen said in a phone interview. Mr. Baldwin\u2019s blustering portrayal of Mr. Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d starting last fall, impresses Mr. Andersen, who said: \u201cIt is extreme, and with a guy like Donald Trump, to be effective it needs to be extreme. \u201d Mr. Andersen suggested the book would be an attempt to capture more of President Trump than just Mr. Baldwin\u2019s version of him. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be channeling and amplifying the real Trump,\u201d Mr. Andersen said. \u201cWriting for a   or   sketch is different than writing a book, which has to be a narrative. \u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that Kurt will do most of the writing,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said in an email interview. \u201cWe have that arrangement whereby he doesn\u2019t put on the wig, I don\u2019t open up a Word document. \u201d Asked how the book would balance broad lampooning with cutting political commentary, Mr. Andersen said: \u201cIt\u2019ll be sharp. I\u2019m going to start talking like Trump: It\u2019ll be great! It\u2019ll be fantastic! But it will be sharp. It won\u2019t just be  . \u201d Two Booker Prize winners have also been influenced by the 45th president\u2019s election. Howard Jacobson\u2019s novella \u201cPussy,\u201d to be published in Britain in April, is a fairy tale about an egoist from a golden city who falls into a leadership position. In January, Mr. Jacobson told The Guardian that he wrote the book in a \u201cfury of disbelief,\u201d and that he hoped it would offer readers the \u201cconsolation of savage satire. \u201d And Salman Rushdie\u2019s \u201cThe Golden House,\u201d to be published in September, reportedly includes a character resembling Mr. Trump. Parodists have been going at the president since the campaign trail. Andrew Shaffer\u2019s \u201cThe Day of the Donald,\u201d published last summer, envisioned the first two years under a Trump administration. (From that book\u2019s flap copy: \u201cWhile Trump\u2019s detractors may call him a tyrant, the American people love bullies when the victim is Congress: Every time they impeach the president, his approval rating skyrockets. \u201d) In 2016, the comedian and author Michael Ian Black and the illustrator Marc Rosenthal published \u201cA Child\u2019s First Book of Trump,\u201d a picture book with shades of Dr. Seuss that attempted to explain Mr. Trump, a candidate at the time. \u201cThere will be a moment when this will be over,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said. \u201cWhen Trump will fade into ignominy and take with him his ability to outstrip satire. \u201d Of course, a republic cannot live on satire alone, and several books are in the works that take a more straightforward look at Trump\u2019s election and presidency. Publishers are betting that the new administration will be a boon for sales, much like the Clinton and Obama years drove conservative titles up the   lists. Agents, editors and publishers have been snapping up everything from campaign trail memoirs to   books with images from the women\u2019s march to titles that sound suspiciously like   books (Gene Stone\u2019s \u201cThe Trump Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living Through What You Hoped Would Never Happen\u201d). Allan J. Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington has already written \u201cThe Case for Impeachment,\u201d which will be published in April. Reporters who were on the Trump beat in 2016 will also offer inside looks at the campaign. In \u201cMy Year Covering Trump,\u201d the Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold will detail his eventful time writing about the candidate. Mr. Fahrenthold conducted a very public investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s charitable giving, enlisting the help of people on Twitter to find out whether donations had been made. He also exposed the video in which Mr. Trump made vulgar comments about women off camera with the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host Billy Bush. The NBC News reporter Katy Tur has sold the rights to a memoir called \u201cUnbelievable. \u201d Mr. Trump referred to Ms. Tur several times in front of crowds, singling her out for criticism while he discussed the media\u2019s treatment of him. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump will get to have his own say about his presidency in a book someday. For now, the previous president is one step closer to that reality  \u2014   earlier this week, Penguin Random House won a highly competitive auction to publish future books by both Barack and Michelle Obama.'"}, "time": 1742564291.3078194}
