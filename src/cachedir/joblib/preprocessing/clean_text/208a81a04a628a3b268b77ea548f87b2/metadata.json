The commander of Russia\u2019s flagship Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, Sergei Artamonov, said via videolink that the ships are now in the \u2018designated zone\u2026 in the eastern Mediterranean\u2019 and \u2018are now jointly carrying out tasks, manoeuvering to the west of the Syrian coast\u2019. The battle group has travelled to Syria from the North Sea through the English Channel in the biggest such naval deployment in recent years as part of Russia\u2019s military intervention in Syria. Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov pictured in international waters off the coast of northern Norway last month Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, pictured in the Englist Channel, is part of the Russian Task Group, which includes the sole the nuclear powered Kirov Class Battlecruiser, Pyotr Velikiy and two Udaloy Class Destroyers, Vice Admiral Kulakov and Severomorsk Russia has been flying a bombing campaign in Syria for the past year in support of President Bashar al-Assad and has deployed a naval contingent to back up its operation. The naval task force has been monitored closely by NATO, whose chief Jens Stoltenberg voiced concern the ships would be used to support the Russian military operation in Syria and \u2018increase human and civilian suffering.\u2019 The ship\u2019s commander was speaking to a presenter on Russia-1 television from inside the defence ministry for a news show that will air this evening in Moscow.

HMS Richmond observing aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, which is part of a Russian task group, during transit through the North Sea Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency on Friday had cited a Russian military and diplomatic source as saying that Russian MiG and Sukhoi jets have been regularly flying into Syrian airspace from the Kuznetsov to \u2018determine combat missions.\u2019 The Russian television channel also spoke to the commander of the Pyotr Veliky nuclear-powered battle cruiser, which is part of the same flotilla. Asked whether foreign aircraft were flying over the ships, the commander, Vladislav Malakhovsky, said \u2018they are afraid to come closer than 50 kilometres away, realising very well how powerful the nuclear cruiser is.\u2019 \u2013 Seeks UN assurances on truces \u2013 Russia says it has ceased strikes on rebel-held east Aleppo since October 18 and has also held brief unilateral ceasefires on the ground it calls \u2018humanitarian pauses.\u2019 It has accused the United States-led coalition of failing to persuade rebels to cooperate to allow civilians to leave, as only a few have done so. The Russian defence ministry on Saturday said that it will introduce further \u2018humanitarian pauses\u2019 only on condition that the United Nations humanitarian mission guarantees it is ready and able to organise aid supplies and evacuations. The UN has warned that east Aleppo is now down to its final food supplies and has urged Russia to extend future truces to allow supplies through. Russia said Saturday it is ready to act \u2018at any time\u2019 as long as the UN \u2018officially confirms its readiness and ability to supply humanitarian aid to Aleppo and evacuate wounded and sick peaceful residents.\u2019 It complained that previous assurances from the UN had turned out to be \u2018just words.\u2019 Vehicles carrying humanitarian aid that try to enter the designated humanitarian passages into the city have \u2018every time\u2019 faced \u2018shooting from the rebel fighters\u2019 and have been unable to drive through because of mined roads, the ministry said.
