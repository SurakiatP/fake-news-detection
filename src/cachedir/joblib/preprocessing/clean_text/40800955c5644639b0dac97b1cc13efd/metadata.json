We are renewing our appeal for anyone with information to come forward,\u201d Met officer John Goodwin shared as part of the appeal. \\nOfficers would not be drawn on the rumours that the man had robbed his employers of his salary and signing on bonus before disappearing. \\n\u201cPaul also answers to \u2018Pog\u2019 and in addition to being able to play in all variety of positions he would be easily identified by his haircut, which looks like it was done by a blind man with a great sense of humour,\u201d officer Goodwin added. \\nPolice hope that with his employers Manchester United being back in the headlines recently following a mixed run of form, they can use the publicity surrounding it to find Paul safe and sound. \\n\u201cJust come home, Paul,\u201d Pogba\u2019s emotional manager Jose Mourinho urged as part of the renewed search appeal. \\nOne of the UK\u2019s most intriguing missing persons inquiry ever, Mr. Pogba\u2019s absence has sparked what experts have called mass hallucinations as members of the public claim to have seen him on television on multiple occasions. \\nPolice hopes were dashed last week when they rushed to London\u2019s Chelsea area last Sunday after sightings of the man were reported but a search of the location proved otherwise.'"}, "time": 1742563175.6018953}
