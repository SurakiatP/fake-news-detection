But it might as well be a world away. In switching networks at a pivotal point in her career, Ms. Kelly, the No.   personality in cable television news, is taking a calculated risk that she can swap her dedicated Fox audience for the broader, but more fickle, viewership of network television. There are challenges from the  . Her splashy arrival has the potential to fray nerves among the big personalities at the network  \u2014   who already compete against one another for interviews and scoops. Ms. Kelly, 46, will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years. And the new Sunday newsmagazine show that NBC plans to build around Ms. Kelly will go up against a giant that has not been meaningfully challenged for decades: \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on CBS. Still, Ms. Kelly is a bona fide star with a   book and a breakout role in this year\u2019s presidential campaign, when she clashed with Donald J. Trump. NBC News comes out the winner in one of the most closely watched talent sweepstakes in years, acquiring one of television\u2019s biggest names who could play a role in any number of major network events, like coverage of elections or the Olympics. Interviews on Tuesday with network executives and producers  \u2014   from Fox, NBC and other rival channels  \u2014   suggest that Ms. Kelly\u2019s performance at NBC will be as closely watched in the industry as her past few months of contract negotiations. Ms. Kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch. Even though she made her name as a news anchor, she has argued that she is not obsessed with politics. When she hosted a   special on Fox in May  \u2014   her first major foray outside cable news  \u2014   she expressed a desire to combine the qualities of Oprah Winfrey, Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose. That special  \u2014   which featured interviews with Mr. Trump, the celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro and the actress Laverne Cox  \u2014   received middling reviews. It was far from a ratings hit: Among adults younger than 50, the demographic most important to broadcasters, Ms. Kelly\u2019s special performed about as well as ABC\u2019s \u201cBeyond the Tank,\u201d a   spinoff. A daily daytime talk show also poses risks.   talent like Jane Pauley, Meredith Vieira, Katie Couric and Anderson Cooper have taken a stab at the genre in the past, and each one failed. In Ms. Pauley\u2019s case, NBC invested millions of dollars, but the show was yanked in 2005 after just one year. NBC said on Tuesday that Ms. Kelly\u2019s show was expected to be closer to a news program than the typical daytime talk show, although it is unclear what exactly that will mean or how much appetite there is for news amid a landscape including shows like \u201cDays of Our Lives,\u201d \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d and \u201cSteve Harvey. \u201d The audience for daytime television is also significantly more diverse than Fox\u2019s   viewership. Starting a Sunday rival to \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the   among newsmagazines, is likewise no easy task. \u201cRock Center,\u201d which Brian Williams hosted, lasted two seasons. NBC\u2019s most recent newsmagazine, \u201cOn Assignment,\u201d ran    against \u201c60 Minutes\u201d over five weeks the show averaged about four million viewers, compared with more than nine million for \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which broadcast two repeats during that time. (This season, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is averaging more than 14 million viewers.) It is also unclear how NBC will accommodate Ms. Kelly\u2019s show during the National Football League season, when NBC\u2019s popular \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d package includes a highly rated pregame show that begins at 7 p. m. Eastern. But Andrew Lack, NBC News\u2019s chairman, has long had newsmagazines in his blood. In addition to overseeing a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d competitor on CBS in the 1980s, Mr. Lack presided over NBC in the 1990s when newsmagazines, including the network\u2019s popular \u201cDateline,\u201d dominated   lineups. Fox, meanwhile, must now set a course without one of its biggest names, as the network continues to recalibrate itself after the ouster of its chairman, Roger Ailes. Ms. Kelly\u2019s exit from Fox News was so abrupt that it was announced on the day that the network had run a   ad in The Wall Street Journal trumpeting the ratings of its   lineup, with Ms. Kelly prominently pictured. Her departure stunned the Fox newsroom, where journalists and executives spent Tuesday afternoon speculating over which anchor might replace Ms. Kelly in the coveted 9 p. m. slot  \u2014   and wondering if Ms. Kelly would even appear that night. When Greta Van Susteren, another veteran anchor, announced her departure in September, network representatives visited her home to tell her not to bother coming in. In the end, Ms. Kelly was granted a chance to bid farewell to Fox News viewers  \u2014   her last show is Friday. It is not clear who will replace her. Fox News has never had an     lineup. Potential replacements being floated inside the network on Tuesday include four women who have regularly filled in for Ms. Kelly: Sandra Smith, a host of Fox\u2019s noon show, \u201cOutnumbered\u201d Trish Regan, a rising star at Fox Business Network Shannon Bream, who covers the Supreme Court and Martha MacCallum, a morning anchor. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a host of \u201cThe Five\u201d who is friendly with Mr. Trump\u2019s circle, and Tucker Carlson, who has put up high ratings since taking over Fox News\u2019s 7 p. m. slot, have also been suggested. Sean Hannity, whose viewership at 10 p. m. increased enormously in 2016 and has spiked since Election Day, could be moved up an hour, but his momentum in his time slot may make Fox executives reluctant to make a switch. One winner in the sweepstakes for Ms. Kelly could be CNN, even though it did not succeed in recruiting her. CNN, while still behind Fox News in total viewers by a wide margin, has occasionally beaten Fox among viewers 25 to 54, the demographic that determines advertising rates. In 2016, CNN finished within 58, 000 viewers of Fox in prime time in the demographic  \u2014   cutting Fox\u2019s lead in half. Since the election, Fox has regained a sizable lead, but now, without spending a penny, CNN will now have an opportunity to take another run at Fox\u2019s   advantage.'"}, "time": 1742563061.0372252}
