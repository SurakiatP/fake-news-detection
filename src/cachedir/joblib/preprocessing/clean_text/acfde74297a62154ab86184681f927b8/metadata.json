Milo Yiannopoulos (shown), the bodacious, bleached-blonde, bohemian, British bad boy of Breitbart, has long been an alt-right hero. Yet, increasingly, his fan base has extended to conservatives in general. American Thinker\u2019s Jeremy Egerer wrote a Monday piece entitled \u201cIn Praise of Milo Yiannopoulos,\u201d and the next day HeatStreet attempted to explain why conservatives are falling so hard for him. Oh, it should be mentioned why his rise is notable. \\nYiannopoulos is homosexual \u2014 and, it\u2019s fair to say, flamingly so. \\nYiannopoulos certainly isn\u2019t the first prominent homosexual \u201cconservative.\u201d As with all groups you find all types: adulterers, philanderers, fornicators, fetishists, etc., etc., etc. The difference is that those types don\u2019t wear their sexual indiscretions on their shirtsleeves. They don\u2019t conduct an \u201cAntagonistic Adulterer Tour\u201d or \u201cFearsome Fornicator Tour.\u201d Yet Yiannopoulos\u2019 recent outrageously popular (and lucrative) college-appearance series is actually called the \u201cDangerous Faggot Tour.\u201d This brings us to an oft-heard bit of praise from his conservative admirers; as commenter \u201cEric H\u201d wrote under Egerer\u2019s article, \u201cOne of the biggest appeals of Milo is that while he's openly gay, he doesn't use the fact he's gay to ask for special treatment or protections.\u201d No, he doesn\u2019t \u201cask\u201d for it. \\nBut he absolutely does use his homosexuality to get special treatment \u2014 via cultural affirmative action in the marketplace. \\nWhile Yiannopoulos did write last year that, for homosexuals, \u201cit\u2019s time to get back in the closet\u201d (though his reasoning isn\u2019t what you\u2019d suppose), it\u2019s apparent he has no intention of leading by example. Yiannopoulos is a master of self-promotion. He plays the homosexuality card in his own way because, being the sharp fellow he is, he knows it\u2019s integral to his success. Just like someone who gets more votes because he could be our \u201cfirst black president\u201d or \u201cfirst female president,\u201d Yiannopoulos is a novelty: a flamboyant homosexual with movie-star good looks, mainly \u201cconservative\u201d views (gasp!), and a British accent (in the United States, people generally think that anyone with a nice Brit accent is smart). If he had the same views and eloquence but were ugly and shared a mafia don\u2019s accent \u2014 and were straight \u2014 you\u2019d never have heard of him. \\nYet the main point is this: We\u2019ve long seen \u201cout\u201d and outrageous homosexuals applauded in the liberal cesspit that is Hollywood. In politics, Democrat congressmen Gerry Studds and Barney Frank both were openly homosexual already in the \u201880s, both were scandalous, and both were frequently reelected. But now we\u2019re seeing how, quite predictably, this defining of deviancy downwards has bled into the conservative fold. \\nAnd the bleeding is now profuse. In his heroization of Yiannopoulos, Egerer writes, \u201cMilo is a savior of sorts all the same, putting himself on a cross when the rest of us were stuck in our sociable sins and taking our beating when we should have been willing to take it [the cross] ourselves.\u201d Mr. Egerer, speak for yourself. Many good men have long been on the front lines speaking the Truth as boldly, eloquently \u2014 and more deeply \u2014 than Yiannopoulos (Alan Keyes and maybe someone else come to mind). That a land slouching toward Gomorrah (hat tip: Robert Bork) chooses to ignore them isn\u2019t their fault. \\nThen there\u2019s Red Alert Politics , which wrote , \u201cYiannopoulos delivers like no conservative before; part standup, part lecture, and mixed with a little drag makes his speech one of the most exciting events coming to campuses across the country.\u201d This prompted HeatStreet to incredulously ask, \u201cDid anyone expect a right-wing site to describe a drag event as \u2018exciting\u2019? Did anyone expect the right wing to accept and welcome a flaming gay into their ranks? Did anyone expect Republicans to enjoy it?\u201d \\nYes \u2014 I did \u2014 a long time ago. I explained how today\u2019s conservatives are simply yesterday\u2019s liberals ; in fact, I have an essay on this very matter in the current issue of The New American (November 7, 2016). \\nEgerer states that \u201caging conservatives\u201d won\u2019t be able to understand why someone as \u201cfilthy\u201d as Yiannopoulos is enjoyable. But it\u2019s not hard. It\u2019s the same reason why many find porn, car crashes at auto races, and decadent entertainment titillating: the allure of sin. As ancient Chinese sage Confucius put it, \u201cI never knew anyone who loved virtue as much as sex.\u201d But my question for Egerer is, can he understand the danger posed by a society that exalts such filth? \\nEgerer acknowledges the \u201csinfully delicious\u201d factor, writing, \u201cWhat we can also appreciate about Milo is that he's actually interesting.... He's stylish and original and something bordering on dangerous.... Following Milo on Facebook is much more like taking drugs.\u201d Perhaps, but whatever happened to \u201cJust say no\u201d? Take a gander at Yiannopoulos in his get-up below: \\nThen consider how Yiannopoulos is famous for talking explicitly about his sexual predilections, an example being his oft-expressed affinity for black d***. This matters because who we choose for our heroes matters. What will you tell your son? \u201cWell, Johnny, dressing like a girl and engaging in perversion is okay \u2014 if you do it for the \u2018cause\u2019\u201d? \\nEgerer certainly is right about Yiannopoulos being interesting; he does engage in masterful takedowns of feminists, snowflake social-justice warriors, and other leftist ne\u2019er-do-wells, and he can colorfully turn a phrase. Therein lies the problem. HeatStreet opines, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to assume that Milo\u2019s influence over Republicans is a sign of changing attitudes toward LGBTs, but that\u2019s not the case.... Milo isn\u2019t normalizing homosexuality for the right, he\u2019s merely a sign of what the New Right values and wants.\u201d But this is wrong on both counts. Polls clearly show that conservative acceptance of homosexuality has increased, and younger conservatives are generally quite libertine. Just as significantly, though, Yiannopoulos\u2019 influence is without question a normalizing one. \\nHollywood has long had a practice of putting homosexual characters in shows and films and making them particularly attractive, intellectual, rational, and likeable. This is no accident. It\u2019s part of a strategy prescribed in the 1989 homosexual-activist book book After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90\u2019s . You see, people have always had trouble \u201chating the sin but loving the sinner\u201d; they tend to either love both or hate both. So you prey on this weakness: Get them to love a sinner \u2014 who identifies so closely with his sin that he embodies it \u2014 and you can get them to love, or at least become numb to, the sin. \\nThe Yiannopoulos phenomenon is a matter of life imitating art: He\u2019s that attractive (to conservatives) homosexual character who softens people\u2019s minds to sin \u2014 which is followed by a hardening of the heart to Truth. As another commenter under Egerer\u2019s piece put it, \u201cThe most effective revolutionaries are those who present themselves as defenders of a current order of things while undermining the moral foundations upon which it rests.\u201d \\nAnd there\u2019s more to this undermining. Yiannopoulos can be seen in the videoed interview below (warning: graphic language) talking about how \u2014 at the age of, as he put it, \u201csomething like\u201d 14 \u2014 he performed fellatio on a man of the cloth. He insisted the encounter \u201cwas consensual\u201d and that he, not the clergyman, \u201cwas the predator.\u201d Worse still, Yiannopoulos talks (4:46 in video) about how, as a grown man, he attended parties hosted by high-status Hollywood figures where he saw things that \u201cbeggared belief\u201d: namely, grown men using for sex boys who were, as Yiannopoulos describes it, \u201cvery young \u2014 very young.\u201d \\nYiannopoulos obviously didn\u2019t report the child sexual abuse to authorities and refused to name names, saying in the interview, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be indiscreet about specific people because I think it\u2019s going to be, yeah, dangerous.\u201d Okay, now, isn\u2019t this the kind of thing that destroyed late Penn State football coach Joe Paterno? Note that Paterno was not found guilty of any criminality, molested no one, and even reported child sexual abuse by an underling to a superior. But that he didn\u2019t go to authorities himself was enough so that he would become a pariah, die in disgrace, and have his Penn State statue torn down. \\nIn contrast, Yiannopoulos describes the clergyman who abused him as \u201ca great priest.\u201d So we should ask, what is his definition of \u201cgreat\u201d? And what does he think the age of consent should be? Fourteen? Twelve? \\nThis is another example of special treatment and protection that Yiannopoulos may not ask for, but certainly enjoys. It\u2019s much as with the Gene Robinson case . An Episcopal priest, Robinson came out as homosexual and left his wife and children to live with a man. Yet while a straight father who left his family to pursue sexual gratification would be branded a dog, Robinson was hailed as brave; and far from being defrocked, was rewarded by being elected bishop in 2003. \\nYiannopoulos, too, has been called \u201cbrave.\u201d But how brave is a man who protects the identities of pedophiles/pederasts because it\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d? Note that this reflects precisely what I reported on in \u201cHollywood Dearest: Seared Souls and the Silver Screen\u201d ( The New American , March 2014): Pedophilia is rampant in Tinseltown \u2014 but everyone who could save future victims is too cowardly or corrupt to come forward. \\nIn his praise of Yiannopoulos, Egerer writes that \u201cMilo is not a saint, and thank God it was never his intention to be.... But in an age when respectable men are cowering beneath the shadow of a new and ugly heterodoxy, what we need are not always polite and political men.\u201d Believe it or not, however, there\u2019s something between being a Devil\u2019s-politeness coward-con and a drag-queen callow-con. George Washington was known for virtue, honor, and never using a foul word, and no one could accuse him of lacking bravery or willingness to oppose tyranny. But we have gradually lost sight of what virtue is and consequently what a true hero is ; in particular, we\u2019re in the grip of our day\u2019s \u201cgreat heresy,\u201d which, noted philosopher G.K. Chesterton in 1926, \u201cis going to be simply an attack on morality; and especially on sexual morality.\u201d Thus, he predicted, \u201cThe madness of tomorrow is not in Moscow but much more in Manhattan.\u201d \\nThat tomorrow was yesterday. And with today\u2019s conservatives, the madness now lies not just in Manhattan but in much of Middle America where Milo is queen. \u201cDangerous faggot,\u201d indeed.
