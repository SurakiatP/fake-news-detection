[Jack Kenyon, founder of smartphone app Facezam, says that it \u201ccould be the end of our anonymous societies. \u201d Kenyon outlines the function of the app with alarming clarity: \u201cUsers will be able to identify anyone within a matter of seconds, which means privacy will no longer exist in public society. \u201d  Facezam uses Facebook\u2019s   user information database to match the picture you snap with the person\u2019s social media information. It claims a less than   turnaround on most queries. In testing, its facial recognition has maintained about 70% accuracy. If you do not want to participate, you are unfortunately out of luck. Being one of the almost 2 billion Facebook users means that you are already part of the developer database that Facezam uses for identification. And Facebook already uses facial recognition to suggest who should be tagged in your photos, so the proverbial prize is right there for the taking. The app is set to launch on March 21, but Facebook itself may stand in the way. The social network says that Facezam \u201cviolates [their] terms\u201d and that they are \u201creaching out to the developer to ensure they bring their app into compliance. \u201d Kenyon, however, disagrees. He says that his company has \u201clooked into this,\u201d and they remain \u201cconfident the app won\u2019t be violating Facebook\u2019s terms. \u201d Furthermore, he claims the ramifications of the app could have \u201ca mix of positives and negatives\u201d and that it could even help to reduce crime. Right now, the only way to reduce Facezam\u2019s effectiveness is to obscure your face in pictures. If you are prone to wearing sunglasses, or have hair that falls across your face, you may be fortunate enough to reduce the chances of being identified by a stranger\u2019s phone to about 55%. **UPDATE** Facezam has been revealed as a hoax, with their website stating, \u201cThis was a publicity stunt by Zacozo Creative, a Viral Marketing Agency. \u201d Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.'"}, "time": 1742562454.3298702}
