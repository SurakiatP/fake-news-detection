A gunman with a police badge assassinates Russia\u2019s ambassador at an Ankara reception. Kurdish separatist bombers kill 14 soldiers on a bus in central Turkey and dozens of police officers at an Istanbul soccer match. Those assaults were just in the last few weeks, which made a car bombing on Thursday in the city of Izmir, where at least two civilians were killed, seem relatively minor. The 75 million people of Turkey, the NATO member and European Union aspirant that straddles Europe and Asia and was once seen as a stable democracy, are facing a ferocious onslaught of terrorist attacks unlike anything that has been seen in the West. Add to that the tumult from roughly three million Syrian war refugees, a resurgent Kurdish insurgency and a failed military coup  \u2014   all tied, in the eyes of many Turks, to American negligence, or malice, or both. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has responded with a furious crackdown on an array of perceived enemies, including the news media, and has lashed out at what he regards as Western complicity. While Mr. Erdogan\u2019s critics have denounced what they see as a bald usurpation of power that has subverted democracy and polarized the country, many Turks, frightened and uncertain, are not complaining. They view his authoritarianism as reassuring and angrily reject outsider comments about paranoia and conspiracy theories. Some are even embracing the advent of   Donald J. Trump, despite his   statements, viewing him as a decisive strongman sympathetic to Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist with little tolerance for those who dispute him. In some ways, political historians and scholars say, what is happening in Turkey parallels the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the 2015 attacks in France and, most recently, the response to attacks in Germany. In all of them, many citizens were willing to overlook or forsake civil liberties, government powers grew, fringe groups strengthened and spread intolerance, and dissent was regarded with suspicion. \u201cI think there are a lot of similar tendencies, and it leads to, in an extreme case, what we\u2019re seeing in Turkey,\u201d said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow for Middle East and African Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. Still, Mr. Cook said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that far a leap to go to an extreme  \u2014   can you imagine if the attacks in Turkey had happened in the United States?\u201d On Friday, Hilal Kaplan, a columnist for Daily Sabah, a newspaper close to the government, lashed out at Western news coverage, including an article in The New York Times, that has emphasized conspiracy theories coursing through Turkish society that the United States is behind terrorism in Turkey. Describing the article as \u201can attempt to condescend and affront rather than reflecting an effort to understand Turkey,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said that Turks have good reason to be suspicious of the United States. She pointed out that Fethullah Gulen, the cleric and former Erdogan ally who many Turks believe was behind the coup attempt, lives in Pennsylvania, and that a former C. I. A. official had once vouched for Mr. Gulen on his green card application. In addition, she called attention to something else: The United States has provided military support to a Syrian Kurdish militia fighting Islamic State extremists, a militia that Turkey considers an ally of the P. K. K. the outlawed Kurdish separatist organization regarded as a terrorist enemy. In her Friday column, headlined \u201cWhy Turkey is looking forward to Trump administration,\u201d she added, \u201cdo they really need such details if their only wish is to represent the Turkish people as paranoid and Erdogan as a villain?\u201d In another parallel to    America, the Turkish government has aggressively exploited tragic events to stoke patriotic feelings and to frame the broader struggle within the country as a fight to secure democracy, even if democratic practices are eroded to do so. The comparison was not lost on Turkish scholars, even those critical of Mr. Erdogan, who were in the United States when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the extent to which there was a rise in nationalism, even among academics,\u201d said Kemal Kirisci, a senior fellow and director of The Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution, recalling his own memories of living in America. \u201cI felt intimidated intellectually, almost felt censured. \u201d After the coup attempt, the government moved quickly to memorialize victims and places rived by violence, renaming a bridge in Istanbul and a square in Ankara, and changing street names to honor citizens who died defending Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government. At year\u2019s end, the prime minister\u2019s office delivered packages to foreign correspondents in Turkey. Inside a black velvet box, with a silver clasp, was a small marble chunk, described as rubble from the Parliament building in Ankara, retrieved after an attack was carried out during the coup attempt. A note said that the rock \u201cis presented to you as a symbol of Turkey\u2019s devotion to democracy. \u201d And like American leaders who exhort citizens to maintain daily routines after terrorist attacks, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, urged Turks this week to carry on. \u201cOur citizens should not change the flow of their normal lives,\u201d Mr. Yildirim said in a speech. \u201cIf they do, it will be serving the purposes of the terror group. \u201d Mr. Erdogan and his allies see a double standard in the West\u2019s reaction to Turkey, and say that some of the same measures Turkey is taking to combat terrorism, like resorting to emergency rule, have been embraced in the West, particularly in France. It is this disconnect  \u2014   between how Turkey perceives its own experience and the West\u2019s reaction to events in Turkey  \u2014   that has contributed to Turkey pulling away from its NATO allies, and moving closer to Russia. \u201cIn France there is emergency rule for three months, and again for three months, and lately for six months, in total for a year,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in September. \u201cIs anyone from around the world asking France, \u2018why did you declare emergency rule for a year? \u2019\u201d Mr. Erdogan emphasized that the violence Turkey has faced is far greater than in countries like France. \u201cMy brothers, Turkey was the scene of terror incidents so heavy that they cannot be compared with France, and more importantly we faced a coup attempt,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom this perspective I believe my country will understand the extension of emergency rule, and support it. \u201d In a speech on Friday, Mr. Erdogan underscored the deep traumas Turkey has suffered in recent years. \u201cI do not believe any other country exists that went on its way standing upright after living with what we have gone through since 2013,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cWe became a unique example in history. We showed democracy can be protected together with security challenges. \u201d Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters say they are especially upset over how the West has reacted to Turkey\u2019s response to terrorism, saying they had expected solidarity, not criticism. \u201cThis is an obvious, very serious and problematic disrespect against Turkey\u2019s right to defend itself against terror,\u201d said Mustafa Yeneroglu, a member of Parliament with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Islamist Justice and Development Party. Mr. Yeneroglu, the head of Parliament\u2019s human rights committee, said Turkey faced the same conundrum any country faces when traumatized by terrorist acts. \u201cIf there is no security, there would be no room to enjoy the liberties,\u201d he said. \u201cThis situation leads to prioritizing security while answering questions, \u2018security or liberty?\u2019 This is not only valid for Turkey but for all other liberal democracies. \u201d Turkish liberals say they understand the need for extraordinary measures, but they make two counter arguments. One is that Turkey\u2019s broad crackdown  \u2014   in putting so many journalists and intellectuals in jail  \u2014   has gone too far, and is seemingly unrelated to fighting terrorism. Another is that, even with emergency rule, the country has become less safe. \u201cOn the contrary, we have faced more attacks, more terror,\u201d said Yaman Akdeniz, a lawyer and professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul who represents many jailed journalists. He continued, \u201cthere is emergency rule in France, but there is no other country limiting fundamental rights and freedoms on this scale. \u201d Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a prominent human rights lawyer who was briefly detained after the attempted coup, put it this way: \u201cYes, ISIS is attacking. The P. K. K. is attacking. There was this coup d\u2019\u00e9tat attempt. But what is this to do with all these journalists? There are over 150 journalists in jail. And with every passing day, they arrest more and more people. \u201d Marc Pierini, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels who was a former European Union ambassador to Turkey, said the   purges in the military, the courts and the police have, paradoxically, compromised the country\u2019s ability to protect the public. Mr. Pierini also took issue with the government\u2019s contention that its response to threats has been appropriate. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen after the coup, the reaction is way outside of the formal rule of law. You started arresting police and gendarmes, now writers, actors, journalists  \u2014   so there is no limit,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you start pulling the thread on the rule of law, the whole sweater can come off. And that\u2019s where we stand. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563295.7267387}
