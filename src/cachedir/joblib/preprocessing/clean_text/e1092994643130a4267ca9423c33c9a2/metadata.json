The presumptive Republican presidential nominee tried to refocus his campaign on Wednesday with a speech attacking his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. But he took liberties with the truth, delivering a series of inaccurate and misleading statements. Some of the highlights, and our fact checks: \u2022 Mr. Trump began his speech by lamenting America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and weak economy. Taking a jab at his opponent, he said: \u201cI know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton. Only by me. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Trump called Mrs. Clinton a \u201c  liar,\u201d singling out her statements about her email server and her \u201cphony landing in Bosnia,\u201d a reference to comments Mrs. Clinton made in her 2008 campaign about a 1996 trip to Bosnia as first lady. \u201cWe had to land a certain way and move quickly because of the threat of sniper fire,\u201d she said. Fact Check: Footage later emerged of Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by her daughter, Chelsea, walking calmly on the tarmac in a serene scene. She later said she \u201cmisspoke. \u201d \u2022  Mr. Trump assailed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state, warning that she does not have the temperament or the judgment to be president. He also accused her of running the State Department like a \u201chedge fund\u201d and suggesting that she had something to hide in the \u201csecret speeches\u201d she made to Wall Street banks. \u2022 Mr. Trump defended his business record, recalling that he began his career in Brooklyn with a small loan and built a business worth more than $10 billion. \u201cI have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a talent our country desperately needs. \u201d Fact Check: This substantially understates the financial assistance that Mr. Trump received from his father, Fred, a major real estate developer in New York City. The   \u201cloan\u201d was for $1 million, a handsome sum that is by no means \u201csmall. \u201d But the elder Mr. Trump did not stop there: He handed his son control of a large company with significant property holdings across the city, whose substantial value is difficult to quantify or overstate. Without this leg up, it\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Trump could have built the business empire that he has. \u2022 Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton \u201chas spent her entire life making money for special interests  \u2014   and I will tell you, she has made plenty of money for them, and she has been taking plenty of money out for herself. \u201d Fact Check: This assertion is mostly false. Early in her career, Mrs. Clinton worked for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and as a lawyer for the House impeachment inquiry against President Richard Nixon, and later worked at the private Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, focusing on intellectual property and other cases. Much of her career has been devoted to government service, as first lady, United States senator and secretary of state. But Mrs. Clinton did receive millions of dollars in paid speeches to banks and others and has served on the boards of corporations like Walmart. Mr. Trump argues that she also made money for big donors through her activities at the State Department and her family foundation, but he has not offered clear, convincing proof. \u2022 Turning to trade, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and cited China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization as evidence that his opponent will support deals that harm American workers. He also said that her record as secretary of state should be scorned because America\u2019s trade deficit with China soared under her tenure. Fact Check: As first lady, Mrs. Clinton privately expressed skepticism about Nafta, the trade pact that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993, though she made statements supportive of it. The trade pact has been widely blamed for the loss of American manufacturing jobs. Mrs. Clinton has called for parts of Nafta to be renegotiated and has said that the   Partnership, President Obama\u2019s   pact that she supported while serving as secretary of state, doesn\u2019t meet her \u201chigh bar\u201d on protecting American workers and the environment. \u2022 Mr. Trump directly blamed Mrs. Clinton for the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, calling her a liar who ignored his requests for help. \u201cHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched,\u201d Mr. Trump said, calling the rise of the Islamic State and chaos in the Middle East the fault of the former secretary of state. \u2022 Mr. Trump changed his tone on Muslims, whom he has previously accused of being generally complicit in the violence carried out Islamic terrorists. \u201cISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality  \u2014   and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety,\u201d he said. \u2022 Mr. Trump suggested that Mrs. Clinton was responsible for making Iran the \u201cdominant power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons. \u201d Fact Check: Iran is certainly a dominant power in the Middle East, but so is Saudi Arabia, and so is Israel. But Tehran is farther from nuclear weapons than it was a year ago, when Mr. Trump began his campaign. It has given up 98 percent of its nuclear fuel in the past year, and partly dismantled many of its nuclear facilities, under an accord that had its roots in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state. \u2022 Peter Schweizer, the author of \u201cClinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,\u201d which Mr. Trump repeatedly referred to, is a   conservative author who is a senior    at Breitbart News and is affiliated with the conservative Hoover Institution. \u2022 Mr. Trump laid out six bullet points from the book to argue that Mrs. Clinton is the \u201cmost corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. \u201d He accused her of taking millions of dollars from foreign regimes that support Shariah law and abuse women. \u2022 Mr. Trump tied the recent Orlando shootings to his immigration plans, saying, \u201cI only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. \u201d Fact Check: Mr. Trump has proposed temporarily barring all noncitizen Muslims from entering the United States he has never made distinctions about Muslims who \u201cshare our values,\u201d and it would be impossible to verify that immigrants \u201clove our people. \u201d His assertion about Mrs. Clinton is based on her support for current United States policy that allows immigration from some countries where women lack equal rights and homosexuality may be punishable by death. \u2022 Mr. Trump said that, if elected president, in his first 100 days he would \u201cappoint judges who will uphold the Constitution of the United States\u201d and added, \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s radical judges will virtually abolish the Second Amendment  \u2014   can\u2019t let that happen. \u201d Fact Check: Mr. Trump has released the names of several conservative jurists whom he would appoint to the open seat on the Supreme Court if he wins in November and Mr. Obama\u2019s current nominee is not confirmed. Mrs. Clinton has not said whom she would appoint, but the notion that she would nominate judges who would somehow overrule the Second Amendment is a Republican talking point that is not based on statements or past actions by Mrs. Clinton. She does favor new gun control rules, but she has said she would seek them through legislation or executive action. \u2022 Mr. Trump lamented that the country has been thinking small and relying too much on other countries: \u201cWe lost our sense of purpose, and daring,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not who we are. \u201d If that line sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it is one of Mr. Obama\u2019s favorite lines, usually used to describe a generous, internationalist America. \u2022 At one point, Mr. Trump said that the United States is \u201cthe highest taxed nation in the world. \u201d Fact Check: This is inaccurate, according to several organizations that have examined the claim. A thorough check by PolitiFact found about 30 countries that have higher tax rate structures than the United States, including Denmark, Luxembourg and Belgium. That has not stopped Mr. Trump from making this claim repeatedly. \u2022 Mr. Trump stated that Mrs. Clinton accepted a gift of jewelry from the leaders of Brunei valued at $58, 000. Fact Check: This is a misleading claim that omits key information. Mrs. Clinton, as secretary of state, may have received this gift but she did not keep it. As required by State Department rules, Mrs. Clinton transferred the jewelry to the United States government. \u2022 Mr. Trump concluded on a positive \u201cmorning in America\u201d note, promising that he would put Americans back to work, restoring hope for struggling   families and ushering in a new era of wealth. \u201cAmericans are going to start believing in the future of our country,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563338.255393}
