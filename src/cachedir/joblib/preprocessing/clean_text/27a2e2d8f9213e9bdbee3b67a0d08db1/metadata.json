By Paul Antonopoulos, originally published at almasdarnews.com , on 5 November 2016 \\n23 year old Munir al-Adam has been sentenced to death for alleged \u201cattacks on police\u201d during protests in the predominately Shi\u2019ite Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia in late 2011. \\nAl-Adam is partly blind and was already partially deaf at the time when the Saudi forces arrested him, however, he is now fully deaf in one ear because of police brutality while in custody. \\nAl-Adam\u2019s family say his confession to any crime was extracted under torture. \\n\u201cMunir Adam\u2019s appalling case illustrates how the Saudi authorities are all too happy to subject the most vulnerable people to the swordsman\u2019s blade \u2013 including juveniles and people with disabilities,\u201d said Reprieve\u2019s Death Penalty Team Director Maya Foa. \\n\u201cLike so many others, Munir was arrested for allegedly attending protests, and tortured into a \u2018confession\u2019 \u2013 he was beaten so badly that he lost his hearing. It\u2019s a scandal that Munir now faces beheading on the basis of a bogus statement that he has since recanted,\u201d she added. \\nSaudi Arabia has recently been re-elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council.'"}, "time": 1742564479.1309485}
