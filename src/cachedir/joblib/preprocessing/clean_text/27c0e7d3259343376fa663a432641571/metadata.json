Now we have audio of Lara Trump, wife of Eric Trump and daughter-in-law of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, saying she believes her father-in-law was behind the latest letter from FBI Director James Comey. Lara Trump: \u2018My Father-In-Law Forced Their Hand\u2019 \\nIn an interview on WABC Radio with Rita Cosby, Lara Trump came right out and said, proudly, that she believes Donald Trump was one of the people behind this whole thing: \u201cI think my father-in-law forced their hand in this. You know, he has been the one since the beginning saying that she shouldn\u2019t be able to run for president, and I commend him on that.\u201d \\nAnyone who has been paying attention over the past 12 hours or so knows that this \u201cscandal\u201d died before it even had a chance to really breathe. The conservative media has, of course, attempted to spin this into something real, given the fact that their candidate\u2019s chances of winning are less than 10 percent. But the emails are not from Clinton nor are they from Clinton\u2019s server. Not only that, but Comey\u2019s motivations behind sending the letter seem more and more likely to be politically motivated. Former DOJ Official: \u2018You Don\u2019t Do This\u2019 \\nComey\u2019s actions are unprecedented for an FBI Director. In a piece discussing that very fact, Jane Mayer wrote for The New Yorker : \u201c\u2026 His latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities, who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the Presidential and congressional elections. \u2018You don\u2019t do this,\u2019 one former senior Justice Department official exclaimed. \u2018It\u2019s aberrational. It violates decades of practice.\u2019 The reason, according to the former official, who asked not to be identified because of ongoing cases involving the department, \u2018is because it impugns the integrity and reputation of the candidate, even though there\u2019s no finding by a court, or in this instance even an indictment.'\u201d There was also the tweetstorm from former DOJ spokesperson Matthew Miller, in which he eviscerated Comey\u2019s actions. He also wrote a more cohesive piece for the Washington Post , in which he said : \u201cWith each step, Comey moved further away from department guidelines and precedents, culminating in Friday\u2019s letter to Congress. This letter not only violated Justice rules on commenting on ongoing investigations but also flew in the face of years of precedent about how to handle sensitive cases as Election Day nears.\u201d All of this makes one wonder \u2013 what is Comey\u2019s motivation here? Comey, a Republican appointed by President Obama, is breaking rules of tradition left and right. And Trump\u2019s own daughter-in-law is on record saying that she believes the Republican nominee \u201cforced their hand.\u201d No matter the motivation, the \u201cscandal\u201d is dead in the water, no matter how much the Republicans and the Trump campaign wish it were truly the \u201cOctober surprise\u201d they\u2019ve been waiting for \u2026 rather than another woman coming forward and accusing their nominee of sexual assault. That number stands at 12 and counting. The Clinton campaign, to their credit, is calling for complete transparency from the FBI in the matter. Listen to Lara Trump gleefully say she believes The Donald is behind this: \\nFeatured Image via screenshot from YouTube video About Carrie MacDonald \\nCarrie is a progressive mom and wife living in the upper Midwest.
