Why? Because they felt like wilding out that night. They were out to create chaos, so they did. \\nSo, don\u2019t talk to me about gentrification in North Philly. \\nDon\u2019t talk to me about poverty. \\nDon\u2019t talk to me about race relations. \\nThose are whole other conversations and not what these attacks were about. \\nNo one was safe from these teens that night. Not the six Temple students who were injured. Not the Temple police officer knocked from her bicycle by a 15-year-old. Not even a police horse. Anyone could have gotten caught up in that madness. \\nAccording to news reports, a crowd of 150 youngsters started gathering after an Instagram advertised an 8 p.m. meet-up at the AMC North Broad Street 7 (formerly the Pearl Theater at Avenue North), on Broad Street near Oxford at the southern end of the campus. \\n{snip} \\nMost of the high schoolers who responded to the online posting were good kids looking to socialize. But then the delinquents did what they often do and ruined it for everybody. \\nAccording to police, a group of 20 to 30 boys and girls in their early to late teens randomly attacked Temple students as they returned from a football game at Lincoln Financial Field. \\n{snip} \\nPeople keep trying to make this a racial thing because at least two of the victims were white and all of the assailants were African American. They make that assumption even though we don\u2019t know the race of the other injured students. (Lots of African Americans go to Temple.) Nor do we know the race of the injured officers. \\nStreet violence is street violence. It knows no skin color. {snip} \\n{snip} \\nAnother student, a junior environmental science major who didn\u2019t give her name, told a website called theTab.com, \u201cMy boyfriend ran and got away but the second I tried to run, they grabbed me by my hair and started beating my head and back. \\n\u201cI remember shoes coming for my face and after that I heard other kids from the group saying, \u2018Yo chill, yo chill, it\u2019s just a girl,\u2019 and they pulled my attackers off me.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nTemple has promised increased security, but when it comes to random street violence, anything can happen to anyone\u2013black or white.'"}, "time": 1742562079.0353825}
