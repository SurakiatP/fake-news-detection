Cartwright, a retired Marine Corps general who as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff served as a key member of President Obama\u2019s national security team, agreed to plead guilty on Monday to lying to the F. B. I. about his discussions with reporters about Iran\u2019s nuclear program. General Cartwright entered the guilty plea before Judge Richard J. Leon of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. As part of the deal, prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed that under sentencing guidelines, the punishment could range from a $500 fine to six months in prison. However, the government reserved the right to argue for a higher sentence, and the judge is not bound by the guidelines. Judge Leon set a sentencing hearing for Jan. 17. During the   hearing, General Cartwright spoke stoically and in a calm voice, answering \u201cYes, sir\u201d to a series of questions posed by the judge to make sure he understood what he was doing. He did not speak to reporters afterward, but in a statement said that he was not the original source of the information. \u201cIt was wrong for me to mislead the F. B. I. on Nov. 2, 2012, and I accept full responsibility for this,\u201d General Cartwright said. \u201cI knew I was not the source of the story and I didn\u2019t want to be blamed for the leak. My only goal in talking to the reporters was to protect American interests and lives I love my country and continue to this day to do everything I can to defend it. \u201d His lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, said in a statement that his client had spoken to journalists after they had already reported their stories and that his motive was to prevent publication of information that might have harmed national security. The investigation focused on leaks to reporters for The New York Times and Newsweek. For General Cartwright, who was known as \u201cObama\u2019s favorite general\u201d before his retirement in 2011, the plea amounts to a stunning fall. It also adds a new twist to a surge of   criminal cases in the Obama era. The case grew out of a period of political furor over leaks in the summer of 2012, when numerous books and articles appeared about Mr. Obama\u2019s national security record during his first term. Republicans in Congress accused the White House of deliberately leaking government secrets, endangering national security to make Mr. Obama look tough in an election year. The administration denied that charge, and the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr. appointed two United States attorneys to look into two specific disclosures, one of which was the cyberattack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. NBC News reported in 2013 that the Iran cyberattack investigation was focused on General Cartwright. The cyberattack was Operation Olympic Games, a joint United   effort to sabotage Iranian nuclear centrifuges with a computer virus sometimes called Stuxnet. A description of it was contained in \u201cConfront and Conceal,\u201d a book by David E. Sanger, a New York Times reporter, that was also adapted as an article published by The Times. \u201cIn researching his book \u2018Confront and Conceal\u2019 and his stories for The New York Times, David E. Sanger relied on multiple sources in Washington, Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity,\u201d The Times said in a statement on Monday. \u201cAs in the past, neither The Times nor Mr. Sanger will discuss whether a particular person was a source or the sourcing of particular information that was published, beyond what has been disclosed in our stories and in the book,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cReporting like this serves a vital public interest: explaining how the United States is using a powerful new technology against its adversaries and the concern that it raises about how similar weapons can be used against the U. S. We will continue to pursue that reporting vigorously. \u201cWe are disappointed that the Justice Department has gone forward with the leak investigation that led to today\u2019s guilty plea by General Cartwright,\u201d it added. \u201cThese investigations send a chilling message to all government employees that they should not speak to reporters. The inevitable result is that the American public is deprived of information that it needs to know. \u201d Prosecutors also accused General Cartwright of lying about his conversations with another reporter, Daniel Klaidman, then of Newsweek. They said that the general had falsely told investigators that he had never discussed an unnamed country with Mr. Klaidman, but that he had sent an email to that reporter that \u201cconfirmed certain classified information relating\u201d to that country in February 2012. Mr. Klaidman wrote an article in February 2012 about the Obama administration\u2019s policy toward disrupting the Iranian nuclear program, including a section about a conversation between General Cartwright and Mr. Obama in early 2009 about various covert sabotage efforts. The list included cyberwarfare programs to damage centrifuges. He declined to comment on Monday. It was reported by Foreign Policy in the fall of 2013 that General Cartwright had been stripped of his security clearance. But with no official word from the Justice Department since then, it had seemed that the case was being handled administratively rather than criminally. On Monday morning, however, federal prosecutors filed criminal information against General Cartwright stating that on Nov. 2, 2012, investigators showed him \u201ca list of quotes and quotations from David Sanger\u2019s book, a number of which contained classified information,\u201d but that he falsely told investigators that \u201che was not the source of any of the quotes and statements\u201d and that \u201che did not provide or confirm classified information to David Sanger. \u201d General Cartwright\u2019s guilty plea  \u2014   not for leaking, but for lying to agents pursuing an investigation into an apparent leak  \u2014   was reminiscent of the case prosecutors brought during the George W. Bush administration against I. Lewis Libby, a former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. Mr. Libby was charged with lying about his conversations with journalists to investigators looking into the disclosure of a C. I. A. official\u2019s identity, but was not charged over the leak itself. Before General Cartwright\u2019s plea, the Obama administration had already brought criminal charges in more than twice as many cases involving leaks of government secrets to the news media as were brought under all previous presidents combined. They included eight officials it charged under the Espionage Act, although in some cases that charge was dropped. In a ninth   case in the Obama era, the government struck a deal with David H. Petraeus, a prominent retired general who served as director of the C. I. A. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information related to accusations that he let his biographer read notebooks containing national security secrets, although she did not publish any of them. Mr. Petraeus also admitted to lying to the F. B. I. but he was not charged with that offense under his plea deal. He paid a fine and was sentenced to two years of probation.'"}, "time": 1742562582.4332223}
