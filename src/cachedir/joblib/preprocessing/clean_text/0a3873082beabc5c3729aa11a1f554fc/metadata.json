Office manager Martin Bishop frequently expresses pride at how \u2018we\u2019 defeated enemies like the Nazis, despite having no military training and not being born at the time. Bishop said: \u201cWe showed tyrants like Hitler and Napoleon who\u2019s boss, although my ability to fight them personally has been limited by being born in 1974. \u201cIt\u2019s in our national character to never give up, like during the Battle of Britain or when I did that 5km charity run. \u201cI may not have been at our wars in person, but I feel I\u2019m continuing our proud military tradition by watching documentaries about them while having my tea. \u201cIf I\u2019d been around at the time I\u2019d definitely have been getting stuck in on D-Day or at the Battle of Agincourt, because I\u2019m a dab hand at archery on the Wii.\u201d However colleague Nikki Hollis said: \u201cWhen the office went paintballing, Martin mostly hid in a wooden fort. \u201cAlso I can\u2019t see him surviving World War One mentally unscathed because he was totally traumatised by the last episode of Blackadder .\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742562189.2595754}
