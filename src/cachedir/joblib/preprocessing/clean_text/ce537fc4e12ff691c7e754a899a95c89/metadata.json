It\u2019s not because people are busy and have suddenly decided not to watch football. There are indeed several reasons, but the main reason seems to be due to the National Anthem protests by some NFL players. \\nNo one has an issue with any of these men protesting \u2013 it\u2019s called the 1 st Amendment \u2013 but people tune into football to forget about the daily grind and everything that\u2019s going on in the world for a couple hours a week and don\u2019t need to see some jackasses protesting AT WORK. \\nLet\u2019s face it, you would probably get fired if you suddenly decided to protest during your work day while AT work. That\u2019s exactly what these guys are doing. They should wait until they are out of work, like the rest of the country, to protest. No one would take issue with that. \\nFrom CBS Boston : \\nA fresh poll from Seton Hall surveyed 841 adults across the U.S. Each respondent was asked to identify seven separate factors as a reason for the NFL ratings drop, allowing them to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for each of them. The leading factor, according to the poll, was the national anthem protests, which scored \u201cyes\u201d at a rate of 56 percent. \\nOther answers also scored \u201cyes\u201d at a high rate, including 50 percent of \u201cyeses\u201d for coverage of the presidential election, 47 percent for the league\u2019s handling of domestic violence cases, 44 percent for the over-saturation of the market, 39 percent for increased interest in postseason baseball, and 33 percent for controversy over head injuries and player safety. \\nAgain, it\u2019s not about their right to protest. It\u2019s that they are protesting AT WORK and protesting in front of CUSTOMERS of their EMPLOYERS. Customers who pay their multi-million dollar salaries every year through watching the NFL; buying tickets to games and buying products of said teams. \\nForget the fact they are protesting for a bogus, communist-driven cause like \u2018Black Lives Matter.\u2019 The cause isn\u2019t even relevant, it\u2019s that they are doing it at work and interfering with their job \u2013 to entertain their customers. If you can\u2019t do the one job you\u2019re paid to do, you shouldn\u2019t have that job. \\nAnd NFL ratings will continue to slide if these tools continue to fail at their job.'"}, "time": 1742563857.1675773}
