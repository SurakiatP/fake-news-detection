The group has provided testimony of the plight of Christians and Yazidis persecuted by the Islamic State to the House Foreign Relations Committee and regularly publishes video interviews with ISIS attack survivors. \\nThe Christian Post picked up the story and video interview, in which Assaf narrates the final days of her 18-year-old\u2019s life. \\nAssaf says her suburb was targeted two years ago by Islamic State jihadists. She and her children hid in the home of a Muslim neighbor when she first heard that ISIS had come to town to kill its Christian population. \\n\u201cLater on, we heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine,\u201d she said. \\nWhen the army of dictator Bashar al-Assad arrived to quell the ISIS uprising, the jihadist began throwing children off of balconies and roofs in an attempt to scare the soldiers away. \u201cThe oldest was 4,\u201d she recalls. \\nThe killing, \u201cin the beginning\u2026 was against Christians,\u201d but they later started killing anyone who they believed affiliated to the Syrian army. Assaf and her family were betrayed by the Muslim neighbor who hid them. She pleaded with her eldest son, George, to use a Muslim name and deny his faith. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hide myself,\u201d Assaf says her son said, \u201cyou are the one who taught me to follow what Christ said: whoever denies me before men, I will also deny them before Heaven.\u201d \u201cThey took him to the backyard to shot and kill him\u2026 they killed him because his name was \u2018George,\u2019\u201d a Christian name, she notes. George was buried in a mass grave, and Assaf does not know his whereabouts. While Assaf managed to escape, many Christian communities in Syria and Iraq remain under siege. One of the largest regional Christian population centers \u2013 Mosul, Iraq \u2013 remains under Islamic State control, with a coalition of Iraqi soldiers, Kurds, and Shiite militias working to liberate it. There is no guarantee that Christians will return to repopulate those areas. Roads of Success has profiled those Christians who insist on staying in Iraq and Syria and, perhaps even more dangerous, proselytizing their faith. \u201cThe great thing is that \\nFOR ENTIRE ARTICLE CLICK LINK'"}, "time": 1742562286.8315582}
