A onetime beat cop in London\u2019s West End, Ms. Dick, 56, said she was \u201cthrilled and humbled\u201d by the appointment. \u201cThis is a great responsibility and an amazing opportunity,\u201d she said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward immensely to protecting and serving the people of London. \u201d Founded in 1829, Scotland Yard, as the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service is known, is the recipient of roughly a quarter of all police spending in England and Wales. (Scotland and Northern Ireland, the other two nations in the United Kingdom, have their own legal systems and police forces.) The daughter of Oxford academics and a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge, Ms. Dick was head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard from 2011 to 2014, overseeing among other things the security operation for the London Olympics in 2012. She left Scotland Yard in 2014 after 31 years to become general secretary at the foreign office. Ms. Dick has held command roles in several counterterrorism operations one operation went terribly wrong in 2005: She was the senior officer in charge when Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, a Brazilian who had been mistakenly identified as an attempted suicide bomber, was fatally shot by officers at a London subway station. A jury cleared her of any wrongdoing, but Ms. Dick has repeatedly expressed regret. \u201cI think about what happened on that terrible day very, very often,\u201d she said in 2014. During the search for a new commissioner, the family of Mr. de Menezes wrote a letter to London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, about Ms. Dick\u2019s potential role. \u201cWe have serious concerns about such an appointment and the signal it sends to the people of London,\u201d they wrote. But Mr. Khan and others defended Ms. Dick\u2019s appointment. \u201cThis is a historic day for London and a proud day for me as mayor,\u201d he said Wednesday. Amber Rudd, the home secretary who appointed Ms. Dick with Mr. Khan\u2019s counsel, called her an \u201cexceptional leader\u201d and implicitly highlighted her gender as a possible asset in some pressing issues facing Scotland Yard. \u201cThe challenges ahead include protecting the most vulnerable, including victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence,\u201d Ms. Rudd said. \u201cCressida\u2019s skills and insight will ensure the Metropolitan Police adapt to the changing patterns of crime in the 21st century. \u201d Of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, several have been led by women. But never London. Alex Carlile, a member of the House of Lords, Britain\u2019s upper chamber, who served as an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said it was \u201ca very positive thing\u201d that Scotland Yard had women in leadership roles. \u201cBut Cressida Dick has not been appointed because she\u2019s a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been appointed because she was the   person for the job. \u201d With Ms. Dick\u2019s appointment, three of the most senior figures in British policing are now women, with Lynne Owens heading the National Crime Agency and Sara Thornton, one of Ms. Dick\u2019s rivals for the Scotland Yard job, the chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council.'"}, "time": 1742628502.355615}
