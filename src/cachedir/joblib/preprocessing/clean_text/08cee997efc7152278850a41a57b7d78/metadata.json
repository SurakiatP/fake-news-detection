Before you read this, please take a deep breath and sit down as this information is chilling. To proceed with the appropriate caution, this story is developing and there is not yet confirmation yet that these reports are 100% accurate and will yield a conviction but take a look at the circumstantial evidence and decide for yourself. \\nCassandra Fairbanks of WeareChange.org reports \\nOn Sunday evening, side-by-side images of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother Tony next to police sketches of potential suspects in a 2007 kidnapping of a three-year-old girl took over the internet. I'm not a huge conspiracy theorist\u2026 \\nBUT \\n\u2014 Leah the Boss (@LeahRBoss) November 7, 2016 \\nThe resemblance is striking, and Reddit, 4chan, and Twitter rapidly took up the case. We found your pedophile suspects @metpoliceuk . You're welcome. #DNCLeak2 pic.twitter.com/H8kF1jWGUN \\n\u2014 VOTE TRUMP! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JaredWyand) November 7, 2016 \\nMadeleine Beth McCann should have celebrated her 13th birthday with her family in England this year, but she vanished from her bed during a family vacation to Portugal in 2003. The case gripped the entire world, becoming one of the most high profile missing persons cases in history. Coverage of her kidnapping was comparable to the press interest in the death of Princess Diana. \\nThe circumstantial evidence goes far beyond the striking resemblance. \\nJohn Podesta\u2019s first email on Wikileaks is dated May 4th 2007. \\nPer Wikipedia Madeline disappeared May 3rd 2007. \\nDid John Podesta WIPE HIS EMAILS the day after Madeline disappeared to destroy evidence? \\nThe abduction occurred in Portugal, where Wikileaks emails show was a destination Podesta traveled to. \\nIn addition, extensive evidence points to the Podesta Brothers having close connections to those involved with potential crimes or at least bizarre rituals involving underaged children. \\nWatch this video: \\nThe Clinton foundation has long standing ties to convicted Haiti Child Trafficker Laura Silsby. \\nWe also know for a fact John Podesta, Hillary\u2019s Campaign Chair, has close family ties to convicted serial child molester Denny Hastert . \\nIn the email below, Podesta\u2019s brother mentions Denny, saying he\u2019s remained \u201cCLOSE\u201d to him. \\nDenny Hastert was a wrestling coach who was referred to by his sentencing judge as a \u201cserial child molester.\u201d \\nThese are the people who the Hillary campaign, and their family members call friends and keep in \u201cclose touch with.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s disgusting. \\nRecently former Navy Seal Erik Prince told Breitbart News that according to one of his \u201cwell-placed sources\u201d in the New York Police Department, \u201cThe NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making\u201d in the Anthony Weiner investigation, but received \u201chuge pushback\u201d from the Justice Department. \\nPrince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton\u2019s email server last week. \\n\u201cBecause of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,\u201d Prince claimed. \\n\u201cThey found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cThe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, \u2018We\u2019re going to go public with this if you don\u2019t reopen the investigation and you don\u2019t do the right thing with timely indictments,\u2019\u201d Prince explained. \\n\u201cI believe \u2013 I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York \u2013 the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they\u2019ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That\u2019s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,\u201d Prince said. \\nErik\u2019s claim parallels what Steve Pieczenik states about the Clinton Pedophilia Connection. \\nWere the Podestas involved with the abduction of Madeline Mccann? We do not know for sure yet. \\nOne thing is for certain. The mainstream media will try to hide this bombshell information and do everything they can to protect their Globalist puppet Hillary Clinton. \\nThey will also likely call this a \u201cvast right wing conspiracy.\u201d \\nBut just remember, this started as a \u201cvast right wing conspiracy\u201d as well. \\nEDITOR\u2019S UPDATE : #MadelineMcCann is trending on twitter.
