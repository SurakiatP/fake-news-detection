{"duration": 0.23730707168579102, "input_args": {"text": "'Critics will argue upon first inspection that President Trump\u2019s speech to Arab leaders in Riyadh today was scarcely a shift from President Obama\u2019s infamous, fawned over lecture in Cairo in 2009. Those critics are incorrect. [They\u2019re incorrect because they\u2019ll tend to be journalists, activists,   politicians, or pundits. In other words: no business people.  The speech President Trump gave in Riyadh was different because of his business acumen. No businessman concludes a meeting without the cliched \u201caction points\u201d. Otherwise, the whole thing is a waste of time. We can easily find similarities in both their speeches: the usual diplomatic gratitude towards their hosts, the pledges not to lecture, the aggrandizement of the region\u2019s history, and the aversion to describing Western vs. Middle Eastern philosophies as a \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d. Fine. But where Obama stopped short, Trump continued full speed into making demands of the people in the room. THE INTROS, Obama opened with \u201cAssalamualaikum\u201d going on to apologise for colonialism, proxy wars, hostility to Islam, and quoting the \u201cHoly\u201d Quran. He spoke of civilization\u2019s \u201cdebt to Islam\u201d his responsibility to defend the Muslim faith, the hijab, and declare \u201cIslam is a part of America\u201d. After this submissive introduction  \u2014   having spent the first seven pages of his speech   his audience  \u2014   he noted that \u201cviolent extremists\u201d needed to be confronted, closing with: \u201cIslam is not part of the problem  \u2026    \u201d Instead, President Trump dived right in, spending less than a page on the flattery  \u2014   and there was scarcely any in that section anyway  \u2014   getting to the first action point by page two of his speech: \u201cThis landmark agreement includes the announcement of a $110 billion   defense purchase  \u2026    \u201d If America is going to deal with the Arab world under a Trump presidency, it is at least going to get something out of it for the American people. Cash, jobs, and importantly, leverage. Wait, you thought that was all? The very next sentence announced the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology. Let\u2019s be clear, this center will do nothing, and likely achieve nothing. But by this point in Obama\u2019s speech, he was quoting Quranic Surah 9, Verse 119, which he claimed said: \u201cBe conscious of God and speak always the truth\u201d. In reality, the passage demands the reader to be fearful of Allah, and just a few verses later explains why: \u201cO you who have believed, fight those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness. And know that Allah is with the righteous\u201d. While President Obama lectured from the Quran, President Trump was declaring today: \u201cWe are not here to lecture, we are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership based on shared interests and values, to pursue a better future for us all\u201d. DEFENDING MUSLIMS FROM RADICAL ISLAM, Both presidents Obama and Trump made mention of how Muslims are the primary target of \u201cviolent extremism\u201d but Obama\u2019s defense of Muslims came more in the way of the following, than anything else:   \u2026    freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one\u2019s religion. That is why there is a mosque in every state in our union, and over 1, 200 mosques within our borders. That\u2019s why the United States government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab and to punish those who would deny it. Later on, he mentions how extremists have \u201ckilled people of different faiths, more than any other, they have killed Muslims\u201d. But President Trump was far more robust, and far more  \u2014   undoubtedly to the chagrin of liberal commentators  \u2014   spirited in his defence of young Muslims who are having their minds poisoned and futures ruined. This is the most effective argument against Islamic extremism, and President Trump put it simply, and effectively, as follows: Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence, and innocent of hatred. And young Muslim men and women should have the chance to build a new era of prosperity for themselves and their peoples. Notice the difference. No apologia for   hijabs, no caveats or compromises. He goes on: \u201c  \u2026    in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim\u201d. Obama\u2019s conclusion in this section was again to quote the Quran. This time, the contentious Surah Al Maidah, often deployed by Islamist organizations themselves when seeking to defend against allegations of radicalism or terror links: The Holy Quran teaches that whoever kills an innocent is as  \u2014   it is as if he has killed all mankind. And the Holy Quran also says whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind. Except it doesn\u2019t. The verse, without paraphrasing, actually reads: \u201c  \u2026    We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land  \u2014   it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one  \u2014   it is as if he had saved mankind entirely\u201d. \u201cCorruption\u201d in the land, in context, is opposition to to the spread of Islam, which includes critique, mockery, or even disbelief. The very next paragraph of the Quran reads: \u201cIndeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment\u201d. IRAN, Perhaps the most striking difference between President Obama\u2019s speech and that of President Trump\u2019s is the section on Iran. Obama  \u2014   with   naivet\u00e9  \u2014   began with another acknowledgement of American guilt: \u201cIn the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of   and violence against U. S. troops and civilians. This history is well known\u201d. He moved on to state: \u201cI understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not. No single nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons. And that\u2019s why I strongly reaffirmed America\u2019s commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons. And any nation  \u2014   including Iran  \u2014   should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear   Treaty\u201d. As we now know, this approach has endangered the wider world, with Iran pursuing nuclear weapons, and emboldened   regimes and their allies the world over to do the same. Without this approach, without this line in this speech, even Kim Jong Un would be singing a different tune today. President Trump appears to want to right that historical wrong, stating today his wish to isolate the nation from the civilized world. Again, an action point: From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror. It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room. Among Iran\u2019s most tragic and destabilizing interventions have been in Syria. Bolstered by Iran, Assad has committed unspeakable crimes, and the United States has taken firm action in response to the use of banned chemical weapons by the Assad Regime  \u2014   launching 59 tomahawk missiles at the Syrian air base from where that murderous attack originated. Responsible nations must work together to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria, eradicate ISIS, and restore stability to the region. The Iranian regime\u2019s   victims are its own people. Iran has a rich history and culture, but the people of Iran have endured hardship and despair under their leaders\u2019 reckless pursuit of conflict and terror. Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve. TOLERANCE, OR LACK THEREOF, Where Obama declared \u201cIslam has a proud history of tolerance\u201d as the Mullahs prepared their latest homosexual to be thrown from a building, and the most recent woman to be stoned in the street, President Trump demanded: \u201cYour soul will be condemned\u201d for barbaric acts, a sentiment that found its crescendo when he declared: \u201cThis is a battle between Good and Evil\u201d insisting that Arab and Muslim leaders \u201cdrive out\u201d the forces of terror and extremism within their ranks. A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. DRIVE THEM OUT of your places of worship. DRIVE THEM OUT of your communities. DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land, andDRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH. Contrast this with President Obama\u2019s section on tolerance, specifically, with regards women\u2019s rights and economic opportunity. Curiously for a   liberal, President Obama told the Cairo audience: \u201cI know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory. The Internet and television can bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home\u201d. Such socially conservative statements would perhaps be more readily expected from Vice President Mike Pence. But the media  \u2014   neither at the time, nor now  \u2014   seemed to pick up on it. Obama\u2019s own tolerance for conservative values applied only in the Muslim world, it seems, not at home. TACKLING TERRORISM, President Trump used the word \u201cterror\u201d in some way  \u2014   terror, terrorism, terrorists  \u2014   a whopping 31 times in his speech in Riyadh. In Cairo, President Obama used the word an even more whopping ZERO times. Obama described   as an \u201cenormous trauma\u201d rather than a terrorist atrocity, opting to deploy the word \u201cextremism\u201d 11 times in his speech, which President Trump also used nine times. As a result, Obama lacked action points, policy goals, or anything of substance when it came to tacking terrorism. President Trump on the other hand announced the formulation of the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, insisting: \u201cMuslim nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion\u201d. Oh yeah, and President Trump said: \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d just FYI. CONCLUSIONS, The way the two presidents concluded their speeches is proof enough of how differently the two men approach the issues of Islam, Islamism, terrorism, and the U. S. relationship with the Middle East. While Ivanka and Melanie strut around Riyadh in designer clothes, and the current president refuses to bow before the Saudis, Obama took every opportunity to remain prostrate before the Muslim world, in action, as well as in his words. In Cairo, he concluded with quotes from the Quran first, then the Talmud, then the Bible. His Quranic verse: \u201cO mankind! We have created you male and a female  \u2026    \u201d may not find much support from the LGBTQI++** brigade of the liberal left today. He closed: \u201cThank you. And may God\u2019s peace be upon you. Thank you very much\u201d. President Trump\u2019s conclusion, in addition to being more traditional, was also more hopeful, and effectively called for a   Islamic reformation: The birthplace of civilization is waiting to begin a new renaissance. Just imagine what tomorrow could bring. Glorious wonders of science, art, medicine and commerce to inspire humankind. Great cities built on the ruins of shattered towns. New jobs and industries that will lift up millions of people. Parents who no longer worry for their children, families who no longer mourn for their loved ones, and the faithful who finally worship without fear. These are the blessings of prosperity and peace. These are the desires that burn with a righteous flame in every human heart. And these are the just demands of our beloved peoples. I ask you to join me, to join together, to work together, and to fight together \u2014  because united, we will not fail. Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless Your Countries. And God Bless the United States of America. Raheem Kassam is the Editor in Chief of Breitbart London and tweets at @RaheemKassam'"}, "time": 1742563320.7318044}
