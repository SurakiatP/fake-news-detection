C. over the bill and that they \u201cneed every Republican in Congress\u201d to get it passed. [Pence called Kentucky \u201ca textbook example of Obamacare\u2019s failures\u201d as he spoke to the crowd of about 100 on the floor of a Harshaw Trane warehouse. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin introduced Pence, and Pence returned praise for Bevin during his speech that centered around the new healthcare bill.  He made the statement after highlighting health insurance woes from around the country like premiums up 25 percent on average around the country in just 2016. He said millions have lost their insurance and their doctors, and he spoke of   of American counties with only one insurance company available to them, \u201cwhich essentially means they have no choice at all. \u201d \u201cThe Obamacare nightmare is about to end,\u201d Pence promised the Kentucky crowd on Saturday. \u201cVirtually every promise of Obamacare has been broken. \u201d The vice president detailed premium increases of an average 24 percent last year in Kentucky. He added that some plans spiked more than 47 percent. Pence continued: Nearly half of the state has only one health insurer to choose from and next year, Humana, headquartered right here in Louisville, is pulling out of Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare exchange. Today, one third of the state is on Medicaid, and as your governor has said over and over again, it\u2019s unsustainable, and Medicaid here is Kentucky is threatening to bankrupt this state. Debate over the bill has come from both conservative Republicans and Democrats. House and Senate conservatives have proclaimed that the leadership\u2019s new bill, released on Monday, does not fully repeal and replace the Obamacare plan that Democrats continue to cling to. Members of the House Freedom Caucus, including Sen. Dr. Rand Paul and others, have introduced their own clean repeal and replace bills. President Donald Trump has welcomed discussions for better solutions as his administration has voiced support for the House Republican Leadership bill. Pence publicly thanked Kentucky Congressman Brett Guthrie, who was in attendance, for his strong support for Obamacare repeal and replace. The vice president said that he knows not every politician supports the plan. Kentucky Congressmen Andy Barr was also in attendance. He pledged that the plan would repeal the taxes and individual and employer mandates and penalties of Obamacare. Conservative members of Congress have criticized the House Leadership plan for provisions that they say create new mandates and penalties. Pence said that the House leadership plan will remove 500 billion dollars of Obamacare tax increases. Pence assured that there would be tax credits to help Americans afford health insurance, that   conditions will still be covered, and American adult children can remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance until they are 26. Each have been lauded as popular aspects of Obamacare. He declared that the states will be given freedom and flexibility with Medicaid. Vice President Pence added, \u201cIt\u2019s competition between the states that will give the American people better healthcare choices\u201d and \u201cfinally allow Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance. \u201d \u201cThe way to lower the price of health insurance is to create a national marketplace and give Americans more choices to buy the insurance they want, not the insurance that the government mandates them to have,\u201d said Pence. \u201cThis is going to be a battle in Washington, D. C.,\u201d he resolved. \u201cFor us to seize this opportunity to  repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all, we need every Republican in Congress, and we\u2019re counting on Kentucky. \u201d Pence continued: I want to assure the people of Kentucky who might be looking on this morning. We\u2019re going to work with the Congress and work with our agency at Health and Human Services, and we\u2019re going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system that makes affordable, high quality health insurance available for every American. We\u2019re going to make the best healthcare system in the world even better. Pence went on to laud the president\u2019s plans to cut taxes for working families and small businesses, roll back regulations, and \u201crebuild America\u201d to provide the best bridges, highways, and airports we have ever had. He highlighted Trump\u2019s concern for the safety and security of Americans, support for law enforcement, and the military. He reassured that the administration is working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get criminal illegal aliens off American streets. The vice president lauded Trump\u2019s choice of Neil Gorsuch to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court of the United States. In the course of the speech, Pence also heralded new jobs numbers that revealed 235, 000 jobs were added in the month of February alone, Trump\u2019s first full month as President of the United States. \u201cThis economy is coming back and coming back strong,\u201d said Pence. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to a pivotal moment in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d the vice president said as he closed. Pence implored the crowd and all Americans to join in the effort to move the House Republican Leadership plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. \u201cWe need every   American to join with us in this effort to Make America Great Again. We need all of you to stand up, speak out, to let your voice be heard. \u201d \u201cWe need you to tell the world that we can do better,\u201d Pence said, referring to health care, a growing economy, and standing tall and strong in the world. \u201cWe can restore this country  \u2014   put it back to a path to a brighter future. \u201d Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.'"}, "time": 1742562955.2440877}
