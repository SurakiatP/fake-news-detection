Unfortunately, not a single customer came in so I was unable to witness any conversations about this twirrit shirt or that tirriwrit tie. I thought my luck was in when the assistant mistook me for someone genuinely interested in the range of middlemanagerwear on display, but when he said it was one of Charles Wossname\u2019s biggest sellers, he sort of mumbled the wossname bit.\u201d   Bravenewmalden   Bravenewmalden   News In Brief 0'"}, "time": 1742563968.6599042}
