Mr. Abe said in a televised news conference that he would travel to the American naval base with President Obama during a trip to Hawaii on Dec. 26 and 27. By visiting Pearl Harbor, Mr. Abe will in effect be reciprocating a historic trip Mr. Obama made in May to Hiroshima, where the United States dropped a nuclear bomb at the end of the war with Japan in 1945. No sitting American president had previously visited the city. Mr. Abe\u2019s visit will be one of a series of efforts by Japan to come to terms with its wartime history, without engaging in direct apologies. He is in a unique position to carry off the trip, as a nationalist who has been outspoken about Japan\u2019s need to move beyond its history and play a greater role in its own defense. \u201cWe must never repeat the horror of war,\u201d Mr. Abe said on Monday. \u201cI want to express that determination as we look to the future, and at the same time send a message about the value of U. S.  reconciliation. \u201d Mr. Abe\u2019s visit will come just a few weeks after the 75th anniversary of the attack, which occurred on Dec. 7, 1941. Carried out by Japanese bombers and fighter planes launched from aircraft carriers that had quietly slipped within striking distance of Hawaii, the attack killed more than 2, 000 Americans and sank a number of United States warships, including the battleship Arizona, whose wreck has become a memorial to the battle. Just as the decision to drop the bomb on Japan to end the war has long been the subject of a fraught moral and political debate in the United States, the decision to attack Pearl Harbor has been enormously delicate in Japan. Politicians there still pay homage to the \u201cheroes\u201d of Pearl Harbor  \u2014   meaning the Japanese aviators and others who died in the attack. There is a museum exhibit in their honor at Etajima, an island off Hiroshima, that once served as the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, a Japanese equivalent of the United States Navy\u2019s training academy at Annapolis. For decades, politicians have been reluctant to make any statement resembling an apology for the attack, which many in Japan argue was the natural outgrowth of an   oil embargo that would have starved the Japanese empire. There are still arguments over the role of Emperor Hirohito in the decision, and that of military officials who had argued at length about the wisdom or dangers of directly drawing the United States into the war. In 1990, a year after Hirohito\u2019s death, notes were published based on interviews conducted with him shortly after Japan\u2019s surrender. In the oral history, recorded by one of his aides, Hirohito asserted that if he had tried to stop the attack on Pearl Harbor, \u201cit would have led to a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d in which he likely would have been assassinated. \u201cThat would have been fine,\u201d said Hirohito, who died of cancer in January 1989 at age 87. But even if he had been killed, he said, \u201ceventually a very violent war would have developed\u201d in which \u201cJapan could have perished. \u201d The account was based on a series of conversations between Hirohito, known today in Japan as Emperor Showa, and a small group of close aides in 1946, just before the Tokyo   trials. In the ensuing years, those interviews added to the continuing historical debate about whether Hirohito had the knowledge or the power to prevent the outbreak of war. \u201cIndeed, the oil embargo cornered Japan,\u201d Hirohito said, referring to the   blockade. \u201cOnce the situation had come to this point, it was natural that advocacy for going to war became predominant,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, at that time, I suppressed opinions in favor of war, public opinion would have certainly surged, with people asking questions about why Japan should surrender so easily when it had a highly efficient army and navy, well trained over the years. \u201d In August, Mr. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie, paid a quiet visit to Pearl Harbor and the Arizona memorial, fueling speculation that her husband would follow, although Japanese officials had maintained that there was no plan for him to do so. Mr. Abe did not elaborate on Monday on his plans for the Pearl Harbor visit, which will be carefully choreographed with American officials. He said he hoped to \u201ccomfort the souls of the victims. \u201d Yet his words will be   and carefully measured. During the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, in 1991, Japanese officials said they were \u201creflecting deeply\u201d on their nation\u2019s deeds but did not think an apology to the United States was appropriate. Several American veterans groups said they welcomed Mr. Abe\u2019s visit, regardless of whether he apologizes or not. \u201cThe war is long over and Japan and the United States are now the strongest of allies,\u201d said Joe Davis, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. \u201cIs it imperative that Prime Minister Abe say, \u2018We are sorry\u2019? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Tony Cordero, founder of Sons and Daughters in Touch, an organization of families of service members who died in combat. \u201cBut it is vital that his words and actions demonstrate that regret. \u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that Mr. Obama and Mr. Abe would visit the Arizona memorial together to honor those killed at Pearl Harbor. \u201cThe two leaders\u2019 visit will showcase the power of reconciliation that has turned former adversaries into the closest of allies, united by common interests and shared values,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. The visit will take place in the thick of an American presidential transition that has threatened to inject new instability into international relations in Asia, raised questions over the United   relationship, and unsettled policy makers in Tokyo.   Donald J. Trump often took aim at Japan during the campaign, on issues including trade and defense. Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to Mr. Trump\u2019s New York penthouse last month  \u2014   the Japanese prime minister was the first foreign leader to meet with the   after the Nov. 8 vote  \u2014   looked to many like a   effort to soothe the bilateral relationship.'"}, "time": 1742628503.3065653}
