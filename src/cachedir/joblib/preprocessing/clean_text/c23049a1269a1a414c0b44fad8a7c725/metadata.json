That is the last thing he remembers. Mr. Nublett later woke up in a state of delirium at a hospital. Tubes were inside him. A doctor was snapping his left shoulder back into joint another told him if they did not perform emergency surgery to remove his spleen, he could die. \u201cYou wake up and they\u2019re ready to cut you open,\u201d Mr. Nublett recalled, his voice strained. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018The Twilight Zone. \u2019\u201d He was struck by a car that morning in February 2012. He spent the next two months at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx. Years later, after multiple surgeries, Mr. Nublett, 57, still has five pins in his shoulder, a metal plate in his ribs and a shattered left knee. He struggles to walk. He has developed high blood pressure, diabetes and severe anxiety. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Mr. Nublett said, an anguished refrain he often repeated. Before the accident, Mr. Nublett worked two jobs, in maintenance and in security. He was   and frugal. Now he cannot work at all. Mr. Nublett said the driver\u2019s liability insurance covered his medical bills, but left him with no compensation to make up for what has become years of lost wages. The catastrophe not only stripped him of his mobility and independence, but also decimated his life savings. \u201cI have to start all over again, like a baby,\u201d he said. His monthly income consists of $987 a month in Social Security disability, enough to cover the rent for his Bronx apartment. He also receives $194 in food stamps. Desperation compelled him to beg strangers for help. \u201cYou feel less than a man when you do this,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you ask people for change, you feel less than a man. \u201d After falling $3, 589. 40 behind in rent, he turned to Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times\u2019s Neediest Cases Fund. Catholic Charities worked with other groups to cover his arrears. They used $347 in Neediest Cases money to buy Mr. Nublett a kitchen table, chairs, a dresser and a medicine cabinet to help him organize and thrive in his apartment, which he can rarely leave. Mr. Nublett, who uses a wheelchair, a walker and a cane to get around, lives in a     apartment. Venturing outside is an exhausting, painstaking process. He does so only to see doctors or physical therapists. \u201cI got to sit here and watch TV all day with a pillow behind my head like some old dude,\u201d he said. Catholic Charities has applied for a   exemption and is trying to secure him a   apartment in his building. Mr. Nublett\u2019s physical ailments keep him inside, which only worsens the psychological pain of confinement, he said. He has few ways to keep from dwelling on his misfortune and the inequity of having his life change so radically. Conventional forms of escapism do nothing for him. \u201cMusic soothes the savage beast or whatever,\u201d Mr. Nublett said. \u201cBut when you listen, you just think about what you\u2019re going through. \u201d Friends have fallen away, visiting much less and looking at him with pity when they do, he said. No family members live in New York State. Other close family members are deceased. His neighbors are friendly, he said, but have not helped him navigate his new life. His only consistent companion is his home health care aide. The medication Mr. Nublett sometimes takes for his anxiety makes him drowsy. He has grown accustomed to that state of consciousness at times, mentally drifting away and pondering the unanswerable question, \u201cWhy me?\u201d \u201cThe only bad things I did was curse, and we all do that when the game comes on,\u201d Mr. Nublett said. He has always followed rules and adhered to a rigid code of right and wrong, taught to him by his mother and his faith. But now, Mr. Nublett struggles to understand the feeling of being inexplicably punished. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about the bad guys that walk around the streets? There are guys out there who are worse. These guys are still walking the streets, they\u2019re still walking. \u201d Additional surgeries are pending, including for a replacement for his left knee. Mr. Nublett is praying that he will be able to get back on his feet at long last. \u201cI want to go back outside again and cross the street,\u201d Mr. Nublett said. \u201cI want to catch a train again, sit down and have a bite to eat. Go to work like everybody else. \u201d That is where he should be, he said. Not taking pills, receiving injections and fending off panic attacks. Not fighting loneliness and despair, as he spends every day on the couch. He should not be here.'"}, "time": 1742628358.7614732}
