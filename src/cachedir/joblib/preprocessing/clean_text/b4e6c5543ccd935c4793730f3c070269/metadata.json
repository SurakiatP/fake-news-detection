All remaining effigy production stations on street corners have closed with immediate effect, with hundreds of 10 year-old street urchins laid off. \\nDespite attempts at buy-outs by foreign effigy firms, it is thought the collapse was due to an unrealistic pricing structure, which completely failed to take account of inflation. \\nEconomist James Hampton told us: \u201cI\u2019ve looked through the figures and I have to agree that the fault clearly lies at the pricing level. Frankly, a \u2018penny for the Guy\u2019 barely covers the raw materials of the effigy. By the time you\u2019ve factored in the wooden trolley, you\u2019re actually making a loss.\u201d \\n\u201cThe tragic thing is that there is still a market need for life-size cloth dolls of Catholic terrorists from the 16th Century. However, taking account of production and marketing costs, a more realistic proposition would have been about \u00a312.30 for the Guy, or in euros, \u20ac12.30.\u201d \\nThe collapse comes at a time when foreign effigy manufactures have been taking increasing orders for effigies of presidents, prime ministers, book authors and cartoonists, while Apple has recently launched the iGuy, and self-combusting re-usable electronic effigy which can be connected to the iCloud to mutter heresy as it is consumed by the flames. \\nThe effigy workforce are today looking for work in industries with similar skill sets, such as working in Build-a-Bear Workshops, sewing together giant bean bags and producing dummies used for bayonet practice. Meanwhile, thousands of unbought Guy Fawkes\u2019 now make up an \u2018effigy mountain\u2019 in the midlands, and are likely to remain there until someone can think of a way of destroying them.
