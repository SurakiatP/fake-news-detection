B. I. over whether some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails should be considered classified, including a discussion of a possible \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to settle one dispute. The new batch of documents indicated that in one particular case, a senior State Department official, Patrick F. Kennedy, pressed the F. B. I. to agree that one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails on the 2012 Benghazi attack would be unclassified  \u2014   and not classified as the bureau wanted. What remained unclear from the documents was whether it was Mr. Kennedy or an F. B. I. official who purportedly offered the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d: marking the email unclassified in exchange for the State Department\u2019s approving the posting of more F. B. I. agents to Iraq. Officials at both the F. B. I. and the State Department said Monday that no deal had been struck, or even offered, over the classification of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private emails. They noted that the Benghazi email in question had been made public with a sentence blocked out, meeting the F. B. I. \u2019s demand for classification. They also said no additional F. B. I. agents had been posted overseas. There is no indication from the documents that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the discussion. Donald J. Trump and other Republicans nonetheless quickly seized on the new documents as evidence of what Speaker Paul D. Ryan called \u201ca  . \u201d The F. B. I. \u2019s latest release of 100 pages of internal investigative files prolonged the intense public scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state, which has been perhaps more damaging to her presidential campaign than any other issue. The new documents also cast particular attention on the role of Mr. Kennedy, a State Department civil servant for more than four decades, in working to oversee the review and public release of tens of thousands of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private emails. One of the F. B. I. reports said State Department employees who reviewed nearly 300 of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails on the Benghazi attacks in early 2015 in response to requests from Congress had \u201cfelt intense pressure\u201d from Mr. Kennedy and other senior State Department officials to complete their review quickly and \u201cnot label anything as classified. \u201d Mr. Kennedy was part of a   battle between the State Department and the intelligence agencies over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails. As the emails were prepared for release, officials from the intelligence agencies argued in some cases that information in them should have been marked classified, while State Department officials countered that they contained the routine business of American diplomacy. State Department officials, who argue that the intelligence agencies are overzealous in classifying information, remain sensitive to criticism that they were sloppy in handling the material. In one of the newly disclosed documents, an unidentified F. B. I. employee told investigators that Mr. Kennedy, through another F. B. I. official, had sought in one case \u201cassistance in altering the email\u2019s classification in exchange for a \u2018quid pro quo. \u2019\u201d The F. B. I. had deemed the email classified, but the State Department disagreed. The employee told investigators that \u201cin exchange for marking the email unclassified, State would reciprocate by allowing the F. B. I. to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden,\u201d according to the F. B. I. \u2019s summary of the employee\u2019s questioning by investigators. A second F. B. I. interview included in the documents provides a somewhat different version of the dispute over the classification of the Benghazi email, with the suggestion that the F. B. I.  \u2014   and not Mr. Kennedy  \u2014   had offered to make a deal. In the interview, an unidentified F. B. I. official in the international operations division said Mr. Kennedy had complained to him that the F. B. I. classification of the document \u201ccaused problems for Kennedy\u201d and that Mr. Kennedy had wanted to give it a different designation and file it in the State Department basement  \u2014   \u201cnever to be seen again. \u201d The unidentified F. B. I. official said he was the one who then \u201ctold Kennedy he would look into the email matter if Kennedy would provide authority concerning the F. B. I. \u2019s request to increase its personnel in Iraq. \u201d The email they were struggling over was sent on Nov. 18, 2012, by William V. Roebuck, who oversaw the department\u2019s office for North Africa and is now the American ambassador to Bahrain. In it, he notified five other officials of the arrest of \u201cseveral people\u201d in Libya on suspicion they were connected with the Benghazi attack two months earlier. It was subsequently forwarded to senior officials at the department and then to Mrs. Clinton on her private email account by her deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan, with a short \u201cf. y. i. \u201d note. Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, said that no favors had been exchanged in the discussions of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, and that there had been no change in the number of agents in Iraq as a result of the conversations. \u201cThe allegation of any kind of quid pro quo is inaccurate and does not align with the facts,\u201d Mr. Toner said. The F. B. I. also said there was \u201cnever a quid pro quo,\u201d but it said the accusations had been referred to the bureau\u2019s inspection division, which handles internal ethics issues, to investigate. The F. B. I. official who discussed the issue with Mr. Kennedy has since left the bureau, an official said. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisers, Michael T. Flynn, a retired general who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the documents provided \u201cundeniable proof\u201d that Mrs. Clinton had \u201ccolluded with the F. B. I. D. O. J. and State Department to cover up criminal activity at the highest levels. \u201d Two prominent members of the House  \u2014   Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  \u2014   called on Secretary of State John Kerry to relieve Mr. Kennedy of his position pending an investigation. In a letter to Mr. Kerry, they accused Mr. Kennedy, the State Department and the F. B. I. of collusion. They charged that the State Department had altered its normal process in reviewing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, consulting directly with the Justice Department and bypassing the F. B. I. \u2019s input. A spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, Jason Miller, said Mr. Kennedy should resign. Mr. Toner said Mr. Kennedy would remain in his position with the full support of Mr. Kerry. After the email issue emerged in March 2015, Mrs. Clinton insisted for months that she had never sent or received emails that contained classified information. But she was forced to backtrack, as the F. B. I. concluded this summer that at least 110 emails had contained classified information, even if they had not been marked as such at the time.'"}, "time": 1742562007.3461828}
