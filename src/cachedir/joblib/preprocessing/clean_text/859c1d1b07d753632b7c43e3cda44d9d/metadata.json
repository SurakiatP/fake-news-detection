The future and sustainability of Sonoma County agriculture was also at hand during the contest race between organic farmer Linda Hopkins and former state Senator Noreen Evans for the District Five Board of Supervisors seat. \\n\\nWith the financial support of many people in the farming and wine industry, won with 54.1% of the vote, a margin of about 2,500 votes. \\n\\nHopkins will be the first woman to represent the Fifth District on the Board of Supervisors. The board will be majority-female for the first time in history. \\n\\nHopkins will gain the seat and replace Efren Carrillo. \\n\\nSonoma County is the sixth California county to ban GMOs, joining Santa Cruz, Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity, and Marin. \\n\\nThis is a big win for anti-GMO advocates because Sonoma County connects Marin County to Mendocino, Humboldt, and Trinity. This means that the ban creates a 13,734-square foot zone where genetically engineered plants cannot be grown. This is the largest such area in the United States. \\n\\nThis is a major victory for a movement that has seen mixed results in local and nation-wide efforts to ban GMO crops in other states. Several counties in Hawaii have passed GMO bans that have been overturned by federal judges. There have been many examples of this happening throughout the United States. In 20114, a ban in Josephine County, Oregon was found invalid because it conflicted with state law. Yet a ban in Jackson County, Oregon remains in force because Jackson was exempted from the aforementioned state law. \\n\\nAccording to Hudson, farmers who are now growing GMOs will be able to continue growing for the current season as a grace period until the ban begins. If a farm already purchased seed for the following year, he or she will be allowed to plant that year as well. \\n\\nYet Tuesday night did not bring victory for all measures. In Healdsburg, Measure T, a ballot measure to eliminate water fluoridation, secured only 41% of the vote. \\n\\nThis was the second time in two years that the people of Healdsburg were rejected a fluoride ban. \\n\\nWhile the water in Healdsburg is fluoridated, the rest of Sonoma County\u2019s water is not. \\n\\nAs people become increasingly aware about the health risks of eating GMO food, more and more counties are fighting to ban GMO cultivation on their farmland. GMO plants are known to cross-pollinate with non-GMO plants, putting farmers at risk of losing crop and money. This ban is a step in the right direction for the protection of farmers and consumers alike. \\n\\n '"}, "time": 1742562102.7186487}
