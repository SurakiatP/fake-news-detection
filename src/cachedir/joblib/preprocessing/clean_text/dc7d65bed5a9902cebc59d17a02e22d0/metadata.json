With that kind of cash, Mr. Mellon, a    tour guide, could buy a \u201cbeautiful\u201d home with enough left over to spend $100, 000 a year (\u201cin 2017 dollars\u201d) until the day he dies. That same number would also work for Celeste Hilling, the founder, chief and product formulator at Skin Authority. Twenty million would allow her to put her    daughter through college, \u201cgive to philanthropy  \u2014   especially women\u2019s and children\u2019s causes  \u2014   start another company, and travel as part of work combined with personal pursuits,\u201d said Ms. Hilling, 58. And then there is Susan Sosnow, a real estate investor and landlord. All Ms. Sosnow, 49, needs to feel secure is $36, 000 a year. Really. She nets a fraction of that as a landlord. Explaining the relatively low figure, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in traveling I\u2019m interested in creating paradise at home, Candyland. I\u2019m still driving the \u201999 Ford Escort wagon I bought for $3, 200 cash in 2004. But sometimes it sits in my driveway for a week and I just ride my bike around. \u201d With just a bit more, she said: \u201cI\u2019d be able to pay my bills, contribute to my I. R. A. and have some left over for home improvements. Money may not buy happiness, but it can certainly buy freedom and security, which contribute mightily to happiness. It also helps alleviate sadness, as a 2015 paper found. In the study, researchers examined data from over 12, 000 Americans. Wealthier individuals did not experience greater feelings of happiness on a    basis, but they did experience reduced feelings of sadness. \u201cWe argue that this reduction in sadness occurs because money provides a sense of perceived control,\u201d said Elizabeth W. Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia and a   of the paper. She also   the book \u201cHappy Money: The Science of Happier Spending. \u201d Jill Falcon, 46, a single    mother of a    agrees. While she does not believe there is a number to buy happiness, \u201cMoney buys safety, convenience, luxury,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can reduce worries and stress. I would love the freedom money would bring. \u201d At a time when the ranks of the ultrawealthy  \u2014   millionaires and even billionaires  \u2014   are on the rise, the magic number for many people is surprisingly modest. So how much is \u201cenough\u201d? Clearly, the definition of enough depends on where you live and your responsibilities. Ms. Sosnow is single and lives in Gainesville, Fla. which is significantly less expensive than San Diego, where Ms. Hilling lives with her husband and daughter, or Brooklyn, where Mr. Mellon resides. For Ms. Falcon, \u201cenough\u201d is somewhere between $8 million and $10 million, so she could give her daughter \u201cthe best of everything,\u201d as she put it: \u201cPrivate school, college, money for an advanced degree at an Ivy League university, two homes, unlimited vacations. Retirement. Cars, gas, food, shelter, extras. I\u2019d also like to make sure my mom is set for life not having to worry about money. \u201d But it\u2019s not pure hedonism. Ms. Falcon also wants to contribute to charity. So does Andrea Todd. Her number hovers around $65 million. With that she would travel with her family. But \u201cI see that as an educational experience more than a luxury item purchased with a windfall,\u201d said Ms. Todd, 51, a writer and teacher in Sacramento who is married with three children. \u201cWe\u2019d travel cheap and dirty, with immersion in mind. \u201d But she would also buy a farm for animals, as Jon Stewart and his wife, Tracey, did. While Ms. Todd would continue teaching at Cristo Rey, a Catholic high school in Sacramento, she would not take a salary. She would also give money to all her alma maters that would be used for tuition. \u201cI worked my way through Catholic school and college,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would make me very happy to ensure other students were relieved of that stress. \u201d \u201cWe have a half mil in the bank, and I panic all the time about not having enough,\u201d Ms. Todd said. In addition to her parents and   all of whom are in their 90s \u201cwith two pension plans possibly running out,\u201d her two children will be heading to college in the next five years. She also has a $500, 000 home with $400, 000 still owed on it and a retirement fund that did not begin until 2002, when her husband graduated from law school. Others would like enough money to allow them to pursue other interests. Valerie Smaldone, a media personality and brand strategist in New York, who declined to give her age, said she could make it work with a monthly stipend of $10, 000 for the rest of her life. She\u2019d like a minimum of $250, 000 in retirement income on top of that, which would continue to appreciate yearly. She doesn\u2019t plan to ever stop working, but if she had \u201cstupid money\u201d to live off, she said, she would \u201cproduce a film or a play, or provide funding to animals who are abused. Learn something I always wanted to learn. Take a serious wine course, or do something in the food industry. \u201d Melissa Soalt, the founder of global   programs for women, would be set with a cool $5 million. \u201cBeing   often means having to \u2018sing for my supper,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Soalt, 61, of Amherst, Mass. \u201cThis would take some of the pressure off. It would not only make my life more secure  \u2014   I would purchase a modest home  \u2014   but allow me to do more to help the world. \u201d \u201cWithout the actual money, things remain realistically out of reach,\u201d she added. Kendall Rush, 47 and a grandfather, knows exactly how he would allocate his fantasy $6 million: He would take $2 million to pay off debts for himself and his immediate family, secure housing and transportation, and set up a communal trust fund with the rest for emergencies and medical. \u201cThe third million would go toward relocation of myself and my household,\u201d Mr. Rush, a   administrator for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority in Buffalo, wrote in an email. \u201cHalf a million for educational trust fund for kids and family. Half a million in personal accounts for    expenses. One million for investments  . One million to invest in small, local businesses. \u201d Steve Sims, 50, a father of three and the founder of Bluefish, an international executive concierge service with United States headquarters in Los Angeles, has a more philosophical approach to lucre. \u201cBeing an unwealthy kid from East London, and now living on Mulholland Drive in Hollywood, I\u2019m not exactly living on street corners,\u201d Mr. Sims said. \u201cIn East London, if I got 250 pounds a week, I thought I was golden boy, because I could walk into a pub and drink myself stupid. \u201d As he got older and made money, he felt the need to show off all the trappings of his rich life. \u201cI remember buying a Porsche and then a Bentley because it looked better,\u201d he said. He has also owned a Ferrari. He got rid of them (now he collects motorcycles  \u2014   he has nine) but he is fond of his lifestyle. So if for some reason he could no longer work, he would like $10 million. \u201cTen million dollars wouldn\u2019t affect my lifestyle and allow me to continue it,\u201d which includes zipping around the world at a moment\u2019s notice, he said. Lynne Dewhurst McBurney, 50, who manages litigation for a financial services company and lives with her husband and son in Ridgewood, N. J. would not quit her job if she got her $6 million. But she might retire earlier. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a secret homage to Lee Majors,\u201d she said, referring to the actor who played the lead in \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man,\u201d a 1970s television show. \u201cBut it\u2019s more like, own my home plus a    in Paris, and a cottage in Maine, and live off interest income from the $4 million we\u2019d have left,\u201d she said. Mr. Mellon has a more visceral reason for how he arrived at his $20 million number. \u201cThe real story for me personally is how bad it hurts that I don\u2019t believe I will ever be able to own a home in the place where I grew up,\u201d said Mr. Mellon, who was raised in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. The actress Michelle Williams \u201cbought the house I grew up dreaming of\u201d in the Victorian Flatbush Historic District, said Mr. Mellon. If housing weren\u2019t an issue, he would need very little: just enough to invest so he would never need to work again. \u201cIf I assume that I can own it outright, I imagine having enough to replace the boiler and fix the roof and keep up with my membership at MoMA,\u201d he said. As for Ms. Sosnow, her life is simple and straightforward. \u201cIf I wanted more money, I could pursue it, but why?\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742628474.7057004}
