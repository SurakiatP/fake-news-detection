[According to a Bloomberg News report, California officials have made a show of faith by moving forward with the $1. 25 billion offering, despite challenges including a lawsuit filed in Sacramento\u2019s Superior Court. According to a Los Angeles Times story, \u201c[t]he suit was brought by John Tos, a farmer Kings County the city of Atherton and several opposition groups,\u201d and focuses chiefly on AB 1889, a bill that alters the way bond money can be spent. Attorneys for the plaintiffs, who oppose the train, state that \u201cthe bond act never gave the legislature the authority to alter it. \u201d  The project is roundly vilified by pundits and talk radio hosts up and down the state  \u2014   every major California GOP politician has denounced it, with the exception of Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearengin \u2014  and now many residents who originally voted for it, no longer support what they see as Brown\u2019s \u201cboondoggle. \u201d  But none of that has stopped Jerry Brown from making his legacy project the state\u2019s top priority. \u201cCalifornia can well afford it, and it will make our state a much better place,\u201d Gov. Jerry Brown said in February in a recorded news conference to which his press office referred in response to questions from news organizations. \u201cI know we\u2019re going up against a very red tide here of opposition. This thing is a   project, and one way or another we\u2019re going to get it. \u201d Brown is coming off a rough couple of months,  as California\u2019s crumbling infrastructure became front page news  \u2014   highlighting the apparent folly of building a very expensive train with money the state doesn\u2019t have \u2014  while raising gas taxes that will hit the working poor the hardest. Proceeding with the controversial project comes at considerable risk to California\u2019s perennially shaky finances.  If the lawsuit is successful in freezing the original bond funds, that would be a major setback. At issue in the suit is the diversion of $713 million of Proposition 1A Bond Funds  \u2014   specifically designated for the High Speed Rail  \u2014   to act as matching funds for a $2 Billion project to electrify and retrofit a   Silicon Valley commuter rail known as Caltrain. On top of that, if Trump freezes all federal funds, both rail projects will struggle even more. CalTrain officials were banking on a $647 million matching grant from the Federal Transit Administration  \u2014   which Trump has \u201cdeferred\u201d indefinitely. If the federal spigot is turned off, California taxpayers might be forced to foot the entire bill, essentially killing the projects by delaying them  \u2014  which can force the return of matching funds already spent. The Washington Post reports that President Trump weighed in on the issue in a note to Congress last month, stating that \u201clocalities should fund these localized projects. \u201d Some political observers believe that Trump\u2019s denial of funds is just playing politics. Christopher Leinberger, chair of George Washington University\u2019s Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis, told the Post that the cuts suggest Trump is \u201cplaying to the base,\u201d because he received much less support in urban areas than in \u201cdrivable suburban locations. \u201d \u201cThis is about pure politics,\u201d Leinberger said. Rep. Jeff Denham ( ) who chairs a key House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee, disagrees. Denham, who lobbied Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to deny the grant on the basis that the new Caltrain cars did not meet the definition of   rail, urged Brown to find a different source of state funding for Caltrain, then reapply for the matching federal grants, cautioning that overcommitment puts other priorities at risk. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to continue to obligate state dollars that you do not have, then you\u2019re in jeopardy of at some point the federal government calling for those notes to be due, which could then put public safety dollars at risk, other transportation dollars at risk or education dollars at risk,\u201d said Denham according to Bloomberg, who sits on the transportation and infrastructure committee. Brown, who met with Chao last month to discuss the grant, said of Denham in a phone interview with the Post: \u201cThat\u2019s called blackmail. \u201d Californians \u201cvoted for a bond issue\u201d for   rail \u201cbut envisioned other projects\u201d using the cash, the governor said in the interview. \u201cTo go against it is the rawest, stupidest form of politics. \u201d Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman and author who is doing a book tour for his new book: Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless.
