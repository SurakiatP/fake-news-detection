NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg reports: \\n\u201cGavin Grimm, a 17-year-old senior in Gloucester County \u2026 came out as transgender when he was a freshman in high school. The school principal allowed him to use the boys\u2019 bathroom, until some parents complained, and the school board adopted a policy that required students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their biological sex, or a separate single-stall restroom office.\u201d \\nSo Grimm, who has been taking hormones and has grown facial hair, sued the school board. In April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed that his case could proceed. Gloucester County then petitioned the court, and in August, the justices ruled 5-3 that the school board did not have to follow the lower court\u2019s order. Justice Stephen Breyer said he voted to stay the lower court order as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d to maintain the status quo while the court considered whether to hear the lawsuit.'"}, "time": 1742561984.4741018}
