{"duration": 0.13066673278808594, "input_args": {"text": "'Not long into a raucous,     set she performed on Thursday night at Carolines on Broadway, Leslie Jones described the experience of having to explain to an elderly aunt why there were pictures of Ms. Jones\u2019s naked body on her computer screen. The awkward conversation followed an episode from last summer, when, amid a series of online abuses that Ms. Jones suffered, her personal website was hacked and explicit images of her were posted there. \u201cNow I got to explain this to my aunties,\u201d said Ms. Jones, 49, a cast member from \u201cSaturday Night Live. \u201d \u201cThey old, and they from civil rights. They just now getting computers. \u201d Slipping into the quavering voice of one of these relatives, Ms. Jones said, \u201cShe was like, \u2018Was it the Klu\u2019s Klux Klan? \u2019\u201d She examined her niece\u2019s anatomy and added, \u201cI didn\u2019t raise you like that. \u201d Ms. Jones said she answered: \u201cJust go back to sleep, auntie. Don\u2019t turn the computer on. \u201d For Ms. Jones, this set  \u2014   the first of six she is scheduled to play at Carolines this weekend  \u2014   seemed to cap an exuberant reassertion of her comic self (on \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d at the Emmys, on Twitter) after she was the target of vicious internet attacks. Most of her   focused on drawing distinctions between the person she seems to be on television and the person she is in real life. At Carolines, Ms. Jones was louder, more playfully confrontational, even more openly libidinous and less easily embarrassed than any character she plays on \u201cS. N. L. \u201d (On more than one occasion, she told the crowd, \u201cI\u2019m a horrible person. \u201d) And when she did talk about the internet harassment, Ms. Jones showed that she could still find   humor in some devastating personal circumstances. When the nude photos of her were posted online, she said, \u201cI actually laughed. \u201d \u201cI was like, they don\u2019t understand how many people I\u2019ve actually tried to show that to,\u201d she added. \u201cYou really just helped a sister out. Thank you for the distribution. \u201d Last summer, after the release of a new \u201cGhostbusters\u201d movie that   Ms. Jones with a predominantly female cast, she was bombarded on Twitter with racist and sexist insults. At one point, she wrote that she was \u201cin a personal hell\u201d and was stepping away from her Twitter account. Shortly after, Twitter banned Milo Yiannopoulos, the inflammatory   commentator who had been a ringleader of those attacks. The hacking of Ms. Jones\u2019s website occurred a few weeks later, but she gradually returned to the spotlight, addressing the indignities in her barnstorming and unabashed comedy. At the Emmy Awards in September, she appeared onstage with the Ernst  Young accountants who tabulate its votes to jokingly ask for their help in protecting her online. \u201cY\u2019all over here using your skills to protect best   in a French sitcom,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cMeanwhile, I\u2019m   on CNN. \u201d In a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d monologue in October, Ms. Jones said she had not been embarrassed by the trolling or the hacking, and she taunted her internet assailants. \u201cI am very comfortable with who I am,\u201d she said. \u201cI am an open book. I keep my porn in a folder labeled \u2018porn. \u2019\u201d This week, as Mr. Yiannopoulos, her onetime antagonist, lost a book deal and a prominent speaking gig and resigned from Breitbart News amid the furor over a past interview in which he condoned pedophilia, Ms. Jones did not gloat too much. Without mentioning Mr. Yiannopoulos by name, she wrote on her Twitter account that people were devoting too much energy to his woes. \u201cBeen done and moved on,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe has no space here!\u201d In her   set, Ms. Jones urged her female audience members not to be defined by how men perceive them  \u2014   \u201cOwn your craziness,\u201d she told them  \u2014   and said there was no undoing the freedoms they had won. \u201cAll women are like me now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe make our own money. \u201d Wondering aloud if she would ever find true love, Ms. Jones drew connections between her single status and the political era of President Trump. \u201cI want to be in love,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to do that, but it\u2019s 2017, and we got a pig in office. The world is about to end. \u201d But liberals, too, could be misguided, she suggested. \u201cIf I see another    white woman from Williamsburg saying \u2018black lives matter,\u2019 I\u2019m going to punch you in the mouth,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cStop doing that. \u201d When she observes these political protests, Ms. Jones said: \u201cNot one black woman out there. Black woman at home watching \u2018Housewives of Atlanta. \u2019\u201d During a riff about rescue dogs and   pet owners who say things like \u201cDid I rescue the dog, or did the dog rescue me?\u201d Ms. Jones spun a wicked fantasy. \u201cHow about both of y\u2019all get caught in a fire, and neither one of y\u2019all get rescued?\u201d she said. Without waiting for the laughter of her aghast crowd to subside, Ms. Jones invoked her mantra from earlier in the night. \u201cI told you, I am horrible,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742562935.62453}
