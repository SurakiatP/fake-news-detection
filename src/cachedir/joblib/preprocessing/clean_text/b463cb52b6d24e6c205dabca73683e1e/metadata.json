Below, about 400 fans and more than 70 members of the news media gathered at the Mets\u2019   training complex. They were all there  \u2014   on the ground, in the air  \u2014   to watch Tim Tebow play catch. The most famous minor league baseball player since, perhaps, Michael Jordan arrived at the Mets\u2019 minor league facility Monday for his first workout in a Florida instructional league camp. Fans cheered and chanted his name, dozens of photographers took thousands of pictures, and national sports network correspondents issued live reports as if this were a postseason game in October. None of this was particularly surprising. Still, it was different. Normally, the first day of an instructional league camp in September is watched by parents of one or two players and is accompanied by a completely different sound. \u201cCrickets,\u201d said Paul Taglieri, the executive director of the Mets\u2019 minor league facilities and the person who has overseen the instructional league here for almost two decades. But like so much else in Tebow\u2019s life as an athlete and ongoing celebrity, Monday became a spectacle, one that also included   humility from Tebow and some earnest hard work. \u201cI felt like such a kid,\u201d Tebow said afterward, beaming, as he spoke with reporters. \u201cTotally felt like a kid. \u201d A former   professional football player who has not played organized baseball since he was a junior in high school, Tebow, who turned 29 in August, took the field with 57 other aspiring players in the Mets organization who are much younger. Tebow played catch, took batting practice, participated in baserunning and fielding drills and later spoke extensively about following what he termed his lifelong passion to play baseball. \u201cIt was definitely a dream of mine as a kid, ever since I was young,\u201d he said, \u201cand to be honest with you, I thought that I was probably going to play baseball for the majority of my life. \u201d At this point in his life, Tebow is famous, to some extent, for being famous. However, Florida is also the state where he won the Heisman Trophy and led the University of Florida to two national football championships. Which makes him even more famous here than elsewhere. On Monday, the fans in the back fields of the complex cheered when he performed the simplest running drills, and they chanted, \u201c   \u201d when he walked past them. With every step he took, more than a dozen television cameras were pointed in his direction. Not even Mike Piazza, at the height of his fame with the Mets, drew this kind of attention. \u201cI am humbled by the fans and the support from the fans, because it gives you a platform,\u201d Tebow said after his work was over for the day. \u201cIt gives you an opportunity to walk into a hospital and make a kid smile. \u201d When Tebow arrived at the complex Monday, he found a Mets jersey hanging in his locker bearing the same No. 15 that he wore on the football field  \u2014   at Florida and with the Denver Broncos and the Jets in the N. F. L. In an age of   it was not surprising, either, that Tebow\u2019s Mets shirt was a hot seller on the Mets\u2019 online store even before he finished his workout. Minor league players do not usually have their jerseys on the market, but Tebow\u2019s representatives, Major League Baseball\u2019s licensing arm and the Majestic company, which manufactures the shirts, worked out a special agreement, according to Ed Price, a spokesman for Tebow\u2019s agent, Brodie Van Wagenen. \u201cI think it\u2019s cool,\u201d Tebow said, almost sheepishly. Tebow said that he was humbled by all the attention he was getting for trying to switch sports and denied that his attempt to play baseball was a publicity stunt. His goal, he said, is to make it to the major leagues. He has work to do. He has some natural power at the plate, but he has yet to face live pitching in a game above the high school level. Defensively, he looks at times like a quarterback trying to play the outfield. Then again, sometimes he used to look like a baseball player trying to play football. At one point on Monday, while still warming up with another player at a distance of about 15 yards, he threw the ball clear over that player\u2019s head  \u2014   and a     fence. During batting practice, Tebow hit several balls off the fence in center field, but also hit some harmless grounders to second base and a few   into the netting of the cage. It was too small a sample size for it to mean anything, but Tebow is battling the skepticism of many baseball people, who doubt he will make it to the top level of the minor leagues, let alone the majors. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it for them,\u201d Tebow said. \u201cI\u2019m doing it to pursue what\u2019s in my heart. \u201d In the N. F. L. Tebow\u2019s last stop as a quarterback was with the New England Patriots, who invited him to their training camp in 2013 but cut him. That ended his football career, other than as a college analyst for the SEC Network, a commitment he intends to continue this fall. On Monday, he was asked if he would consider a return to football if a team like the Patriots  \u2014   whose temporary starting quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, was injured on Sunday  \u2014   reached out to him. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d he replied politely. \u201cI am part of the Mets\u2019 family. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563146.7505147}
