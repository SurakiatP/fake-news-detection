Abedin is perhaps Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest confidante. During the course of the FBI\u2019s investigation, she spoke with federal agents on several occasions, evading questions and providing only vague answers to direct inquiries. \u201cThe process has begun,\u201d stated the bureau Sunday in a rather cryptic message, suggesting that Abedin\u2019s emails will be possibly be examined before election day. Enjoying intimate access to the former secretary of state, Abedin sent several emails through Hillary\u2019s private server. A few months ago, the FBI explicitly asked Abedin to hand over any information, including emails and devices those emails may be stored in to investigators. It now looks like she failed to comply with the request. In a bizarre twist of events, the FBI found hundreds of thousands of Abedin\u2019s emails stored on a laptop belonging to her now-estranged husband. The emails were discovered as investigators seized evidence related to a separate investigation regarding an inquiry into disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s possible sexual overtures to a minor.

There may be evidence hiding in those emails that could incriminate Abedin\u2019s boss, US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But we likely won\u2019t find out until after the election, raising unsettling questions about the integrity of our fragile democracy. \\nAs a matter of principle, the FBI should tell the American people everything it knows before voters cast their ballots on November 8th.
