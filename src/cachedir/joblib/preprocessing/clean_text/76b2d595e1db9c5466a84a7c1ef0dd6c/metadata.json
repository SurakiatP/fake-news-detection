[I\u2019d love to repost it here so that you can see how harmless it was, how totally not in breach of a single one of Facebook\u2019s \u201cCommunity Standards\u201d. But because Facebook deleted it before I could save it you\u2019re just going to have to take my word that it did not contain \u201cdirect threats\u201d encourage \u201c \u201d promote \u201cdangerous organizations\u201d enable \u201cbullying and harassment\u201d or involve any \u201cattacks on public figures\u201d. Nor did it engage in \u201ccriminal activity\u201d \u201csexual violence and exploitation\u201d or have anything to do with \u201cregulated goods\u201d.  But I got landed with a   ban, all the same  \u2014   together with a threat that if I carried on doing whatever I hadn\u2019t done wrong then next time the ban might be permanent. For some of you this won\u2019t matter because Facebook. You think Mark Zuckerberg is a weird sociopath, that it\u2019s a cesspit of festering   that social media is a waste of time. Yes I get that  \u2014   but you don\u2019t work in the media, whereas I do and for all of us in the communications industry whether we\u2019re writers, entertainers, journalists, bloggers, vloggers or podcasters Facebook is a big deal because so much of our audience is on it. And it\u2019s as important to those of us on the right as it is on the left. Breitbart, for example, gets a lot of its traffic via Facebook. Milo  \u2014   never knowingly   has a huge Facebook presence. The idea that we on the conservative side of the argument can afford to ignore a market of one billion potential readers  because Facebook is run by liberals is just dumb. If you accept  \u2014   as logic and facts dictate you should  \u2014   that Facebook matters, then you should be very, very worried about the direction in which it is headed. That\u2019s because the people it\u2019s going to hurt most are people like us: Brexiteers, Trump voters, climate sceptics, conservatarians, lovers of offensive memes involving cartoon frogs or gorillas,     anyone in fact who dares to set themselves against the politically correct values of liberal elite types like the guys who run Facebook. What\u2019s significant about my temporary Facebook ban is not so much that it happened but that it happened for no good reason. Sure, my piece contained some strong language: \u201ccucks\u201d got used a few times, as did the phrase \u201c \u201d. But neither of those terms is proscribed under Facebook\u2019s Community Standards. And though there was definitely a goodly amount of righteous rage in the piece, at no point did I name names. It was just directed generally at the NeverTrumpers, whom I held largely responsible for Milo\u2019s recent defenestration. I felt  \u2014   to sum up the argument of the piece  \u2014   that Milo was yet another example of the way conservatives love to throw their own to the wolves in order to appease the liberal left. Nor, I added, was I convinced by the pathetic argument that this was OK because \u201cMilo is not a conservative. \u201d That English faggot, I argued, has done more for the free speech of conservative students on campus than four decades\u2019 worth of elegant editorials in journals like the National Review  \u2026     This, I think, was an argument that needed to be made. Facebook clearly disagreed because  \u2014   acting, presumably, on a vexatious complaint  \u2014   they took it down without explanation. One of the very worst things about the market domination by Facebook and Twitter is that it enables the kind of people who normally loathe free markets, property rights and enterprise to pose like they\u2019re libertarian conservatives. \u201cOh, so you don\u2019t like the rules on Facebook and Twitter? Well, they\u2019re private businesses and they can make up what rules they like. If you don\u2019t like them, go somewhere else  \u2026    \u201d But you can bet that these passionate     wouldn\u2019t be half so sanguine if they were subject to the prejudice and arbitrary injustice Facebook and Twitter impose on their conservative (and other   ) users. Facebook\u2019s shameless liberal bias has been   on Breitbart for example here and here. In response, Facebook\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, promised to make amends. After first denying any knowledge of bias, Zuckerberg was forced to admit some former Facebook employees that curated content \u201cmight\u201d have been biased against conservatives. He promised to retrain employees and impose new \u201ccontrols and oversight\u201d to cut bias. He also agreed to stop allowing the liberal New York Times, CNN, NBC News, Washington Post and BuzzFeed to dominate Facebook New Feed postings. But the revelations kicked off a Senate inquiry of Zuckerberg from Republican John Thune, Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. To avoid an official investigation into News Feed continuing bias, Facebook launched an internal investigation. After determining there had been \u201cunintentional biases\u201d by its overwhelmingly progressive workforce, Zuckerberg took the extraordinary step of firing all News Feed curators in July. The good intentions don\u2019t seem to have lasted long, though. Part of his problem may be that Facebook is only going to be as good as the people working for it. And due to the inevitable liberal selection bias, these are inevitably going to be liberal college graduates with liberal values who wouldn\u2019t even know what a viable alternative viewpoint was if it bit them on the arse  \u2014   and who therefore decide that any opinion which doesn\u2019t accord with their own stultifying political correctness must ergo be \u201chate speech. \u201d That\u2019s my number one theory, at any rate, as to how my Milo piece got me my ban. It broke none of the official Facebook community rules. Just the unofficial one: thou shall not express conservative opinion forcefully. Obviously I can\u2019t prove it because of the exceedingly untransparent way in which Facebook operates: you get banned without recourse to any higher form of justice. But the much bigger problem is this: across the world from the US to the UK but perhaps most especially in Germany right now, the liberal elite is being uprooted by a populist revolution. The ugly, undisciplined, inappropriate, deplorable masses  \u2014   that\u2019s you and me, by the way, among others  \u2014   are rising up in revolt, reclaiming our democratic rights, and the people who\u2019ve got used to bossing us around these last few decades just don\u2019t like it one bit. That\u2019s why the liberal elite are using every tool at their disposal to frustrate this popular revolt. One of the main ones is their hegemony over the media. They\u2019ve dominated the mainstream media for years and they\u2019d very much like to do the same to the alternative media, which is disruptive, unkempt and a serious threat to their power base. Hence the \u201cfake news\u201d narrative the  \u2019s media propagandists invented last year: to discredit the alternative viewpoints expressed everywhere from the conservative blogosphere to news sites like Breitbart. It\u2019s no coincidence that the politicians agitating for Facebook to come down harder on \u201cfake news\u201d are the ones who have most to fear from the Brexit and Trump revolutions  \u2014   people like Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper in the UK, Angela Merkel\u2019s government in Germany which is planning to punish Facebook with swingeing fines it fails to toe the line. This has nothing to do with decency or fairness or balance. It\u2019s another manifestation of the liberal elite\u2019s determination to close down its opposition by whatever means necessary.'"}, "time": 1742561832.8394566}
