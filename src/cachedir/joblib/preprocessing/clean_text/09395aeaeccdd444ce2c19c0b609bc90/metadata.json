Giving votes to foreign nationals/States is tantamount to treason. Donald Costa \\nProblem is they hate this place and it\u2019s people if you don\u2019t stop them it will never end. Jensen \\nthis is the problem, I have seen videos of people from some where around the vicinity of Syria Africa and these are all MEN who say they use fake passports and they\u2019re goal is to go where there is the best welfare. This is a form of Jihad to use our welfare system and tax us to death. These people will come to American on our dime and vote us out and make us pay for it. Are you ok with that\u2026 Im not sjcthrn5 . \\nThat is seriously messed up. I don\u2019t understand our government sometimes. How can they get welfare or public assistance so easily? I was in a rollover accident a little over six months ago where my arm was ripped off at the elbow, had to have six vertebrae in my neck fused, had a couple of skin grafts and a wound on the top of my head that still hasn\u2019t closed all the way up and healed. I went to DSHS to see about help while i recovered and filled out all the applications and medical records releases. I got denied on everything. I will say that they took over healthcare after insurance limits were reached, which didn\u2019t take long the 15 minute helicopter ride was over $29,000 alone. I have never used any public service before, I\u2019m a veteran and I have always had a job since I was 13 years old. I understand helping those immigrants that need it but shouldn\u2019t their be some kind of vetting oversight? Especially when you make your own citizens jump through all kinds of hoops only to tell them no. r.terbeek \\nsjcthrn5, You need to get an attorney!! Find one that doesn\u2019t get paid if you don\u2019t. millerstwo \\nFor years the Marxist Democrats have openly committed voter fraud knowing that the cowardly Republicans would do absolutely nothing to stop it out of fear of being called racists. Cheating at the polls is now considered \u2018the norm\u2019 for this group of America hating liars and cheats. The following has nothing to do with our \u201cvoter fraud\u201d conversation per se, but\u2026\u2026\u2026a couple of days ago I read an article about the genius of Thomas Jefferson and his obsession with America and then I thought about the millions of American hero\u2019s both \u201cgentlemen and commoners\u201d who died in wars defending our Nations freedom then I was suddenly overwhelmed with a sadness realizing what was at stake regarding possibly our last \u2018real election\u2019\u2026\u2026these great Americans will have died in vane if the Marxists are allowed to steal this election. Then Patrick Henry\u2019s immortal words came to mind\u2026.\u201c.. I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\u201d . \\nDido Patrick Bettyj9553 \\nLet\u2019s all pray that Trump gets in. I am so disgusted with how this government and how it is running us all into the ground. The corruption has got to stop. I can\u2019t even believe it is this hard to stop Hillary after all the stuff that has come out about her over and over. How can anyone feel that strongly about voting for a woman who is corrupt in every way. She has never done anything for anyone except when it benefits her. RICARDO36 \\nWhy do you think they\u2019re so afraid of TRUMP, He is his own man and servant to none! He would clean up that rat\u201ds nest in Washington and put the D.C. MAFIA out of business! GOD HELP AMERICA!! \\nPingback: Dem Official: 'I Think There's a lot of Voter Fraud' - Big Sky Headlines () Mary M.B. \\nGood guy\u2026so sorry for him ( no good deed goes unpunished), he just lost his job and all forms of employment in N.Y\u2026.
