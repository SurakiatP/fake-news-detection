Trump. In a brief but at times introspective interview, Mrs. Clinton said that although other countries have been led by women, such a milestone would be different were it to happen in the United States. She called the demands of the American political system more personally grueling and difficult. \u201cI really believe our system is probably the most challenging in the world,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a prime minister, you\u2019re chosen by your peers,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re president, you run statewide, but it\u2019s usually with the backing of a party and you don\u2019t have to raise the money to run. \u201d But, she added, \u201cWomen candidates all face the same scrutiny, and questions about ourselves, so there are similarities. \u201d The implications of her claiming the Democratic nomination for president  \u2014   the first woman to do so for a major American political party  \u2014   became clear quickly for Mrs. Clinton, 68, in recent days. Prominent women and many male leaders have \u201creached out to me in recent days to encourage me and say how much this election means to their country and the world. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m still processing,\u201d Mrs. Clinton added. Her comments came days before Mr. Trump plans to give a major speech seeking to revive the scandals of the 1990s that entangled Mrs. Clinton and her husband, Bill, and criticize the foundation the family has run. She vowed not to respond to his personal attacks and said she would continue to use his words against him. \u201cI am responding to his very apparent lack of qualifications to be president based on what he has said and done and the temperamentally unfit person he is,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. She joined Republican leaders including Speaker Paul D. Ryan in denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s comments last week that a   judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel of United States District Court, had been biased against Mr. Trump because of his heritage. Mrs. Clinton went beyond her previous characterization of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, saying on Wednesday that his attack on Judge Curiel based on his ethnicity was \u201can outrageous, racist attack. \u201d But even as Mrs. Clinton tried to portray a steely fortitude in facing Mr. Trump, and a determination not to allow his personal attacks to get her off course, she offered a glimpse of the toll that reliving some of her lowest and most publicly humiliating moments would take. Throughout her second presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton has drawn on the inspiration of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was born into poverty and neglect and taught her daughter, from an early age, to confront bullies and stand up for herself. \u201cShe was such a stalwart support in every way, mostly personal, but she would have been excited she would have been proud,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said about how Mrs. Rodham would have viewed the events of the past few days. But, Mrs. Clinton also suggested that her mother would be eager to protect her from the attacks to come. \u201cShe might have been a little apprehensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a very big step. \u201d Mrs. Clinton offered a vigorous defense of a decision which has haunted her primary campaign  \u2014   her acceptance of large amounts of money for giving speeches to Wall Street banks, a practice that even her most ardent supporters have viewed as puzzlingly  . Mrs. Clinton called such speeches that garner   fees \u201cthe norm\u201d for previous secretaries of state. \u201cI actually think it makes sense,\u201d she added. When pressed on why, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the Occupy Wall Street movement, she chose to give such speeches, Mrs. Clinton reiterated that she had put forth \u201cthe most specific plan\u201d of any candidate to regulate the financial industry. \u201cA lot of people know you have a   seat in what is going on in the world, so maybe you have some interesting observations about political or economic concerns,\u201d Mrs. Clinton explained. \u201cThat to me is how it came about, and that\u2019s what I talked about when I was making speeches. \u201d During the interview, Mrs. Clinton seemed almost to be trying to grapple with the meaning of her achievement and the overall restive mood of the country. She seemed also to be wrestling with themes she publicly raised, at times to mockery, in her early years in the White House  \u2014   about whether the country has lost its sense of larger mission and community. \u201cIt\u2019s important people feel like they\u2019re part of a larger national purpose,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIt makes a big difference if people have jobs with dignity and purpose. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve thought a lot and spoken about, from time to time,\u201d the need for more \u201clove and kindness. \u201d Or, as she put it in 1993, drawing on the reflections of the Republican operative Lee Atwater as he faced death, \u201ca little heart, a lot of brotherhood. \u201d \u201cI think in this campaign I\u2019ve tried to raise some of those themes again,\u201d she continued. Now that she has finished a primary battle that stretched on far longer than she expected, Mrs. Clinton, speaking from her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. planned to visit the local bookstore. \u201cI\u2019ll finally have a break where I\u2019ll have some time,\u201d she said. \u201cI love to wander around bookstores and see what strikes my fancy. \u201d She pointed to one book she had read recently that she said would stay with her through the general election: the swimmer Diana Nyad\u2019s memoir, \u201cFind a Way,\u201d about her nearly   swim at age 64 from Cuba to Florida. \u201cWhen you\u2019re facing big challenges in your life, you can think about Diana Nyad getting attacked by the lethal sting of box jellyfishes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd nearly anything else seems doable in comparison. \u201d Asked if Mr. Trump would be her \u201cbox jellyfish\u201d over the coming months, Mrs. Clinton let out a hearty laugh, then demurred. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742628463.4608092}
