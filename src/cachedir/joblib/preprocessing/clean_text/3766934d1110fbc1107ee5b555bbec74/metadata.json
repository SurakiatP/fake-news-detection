[Kobach said taxation would be a core issue in his campaign.  LISTEN: \u201cSome people may know Kansas. We did cut our income taxes quite a bit and reduced to zero the taxes on LLCs and S corporations a few years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans in the legislature just raised those taxes back up, doing so on the theory that they had to, to balance the budget. \u201d \u201cI think that Kansas doesn\u2019t have a revenue problem. It has a spending problem. We should have been cutting the budget,\u201d he contended. On immigration, Kobach said Kansas is \u201ca fairly conservative state, but our legislature hasn\u2019t been conservative, and we\u2019ve kind of become the sanctuary state of the Midwest. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not formally a sanctuary state, but we do nothing to discourage illegal immigration,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cWe give aliens   tuition. I want to stop that. \u201d Kobach noted Kansas is \u201cone of the very few states west of the Mississippi that does not have term limits,\u201d which he saw as vital to fighting corruption. \u201cAs a result, our legislators, some of them form entire careers in the state legislature. I\u2019d like to see us have term limits for the legislature, as well as for the entire list of statewide offices,\u201d he said. Kobach wryly conceded, \u201cThe left is not excited that I\u2019m running\u201d when Boyle noted the panoply of   groups denouncing his candidacy for governor. Boyle noted the left was fearful that Kobach really would put a stop to \u201cunbelievable\u201d policies like giving discounted   tuition rates to illegal immigrants. \u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d Kobach agreed. \u201cI mean, think about it: You\u2019ve got someone who lives in a neighboring state, say Missouri. A kid grows up there, wants to go to Kansas University or Kansas State, pays three times as much in tuition as an illegal alien. It makes no sense whatsoever. It\u2019s against federal law. Congress was trying to stop this way back in the nineties they passed a law saying no state could do it, but several states did anyway. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to stop that. I think you just need a governor who will come in and say, \u2018Look, I\u2019m not budging. We\u2019re going to do it, and we\u2019re going to do it now, or we\u2019re going to do it later, but we\u2019re going to do it while I\u2019m governor,\u2019\u201d he said, promising to \u201cdraw some lines in the sand and not let anyone cross them. \u201d Kobach laid out three major points in his   agenda. \u201cOne I already mentioned was term limits. Try to push term limits through. Now, that\u2019s going to be a heavy lift since we don\u2019t have the popular initiative. We\u2019re going to have to push it through the legislature, and you know most politicians don\u2019t like limiting their own terms in legislatures,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond is pass a statute stopping the revolving door,\u201d he continued. \u201cRight now in Kansas, you can retire from the legislature, and then the next day, you can start lobbying your former colleagues. We\u2019ll put time limits on how soon you can become a lobbyist in Kansas. You can become a lobbyist somewhere else if you want, but not in Kansas. \u201d Kobach said his third goal would be to achieve political transparency by replacing \u201cRepublicans in Name Only\u201d who tend to side with Democrats. \u201cWe really have this problem very badly in Kansas,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf you look at the numbers, our legislature in the Senate is 32 to 8  \u2014   32 Republicans to 8 Democrats. Similar lopsided numbers in the House, over a   majority Republican. But many of those Republicans are truly RINOs  \u2014   Republicans in Name Only. They vote with the Democrats all the time. When they go home, they talk like Republicans. They might even use the word \u2018conservative\u2019 to describe themselves. But then, they come in and become a completely different person when they are in the state legislature. \u201d \u201cOne of the things the governor has to do is actually call people out by name and say, \u2018Look, I need this person\u2019s vote\u2019 and try to get the public aware of who these people are who are breaching the public trust,\u201d said Kobach.  \u201cIf their district wants to elect someone who is liberal and votes with the Democrats, so be it. But there is a real deception going on. You see it in states like Kansas, where there are districts across the western part of our state which will not elect a Democrat, period. So what the Democrats do is, they just run as Republicans,\u201d he said. Kobach agreed with Boyle that voters are tired of politicians who say one thing and do another. \u201cI think they\u2019re also tired of the politician who talks like everything he says is carefully polished and has gone through three focus groups,\u201d Kobach added. \u201cThe thing that people loved about Trump is that he\u2019s speaking from the gut. They could tell that this is what the guy really thinks. His speech wasn\u2019t prepared and screened and reviewed by others, a bunch of     baloney, but is actually a guy telling us what he thinks. I think that\u2019s important. \u201d \u201cNobody can do it like President Trump does it, but that\u2019s kind of the way I have spoken to my constituents as secretary of state: \u2018Here, this is what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush. If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t vote for me,\u2019\u201d he said.
