Andrew Cuomo said at Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem on Sunday, adding that his state would take \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to fight the trend. [Cuomo\u2019s remarks came on the heels of what was originally believed to have been an act of vandalism in which headstones at a Jewish cemetery in Brooklyn were overturned.  Authorities later determined the graves were damaged as a result of environmental and other factors.  There have been over 120 bomb threats made to Jewish institutions all over the U. S. and desecrations of several Jewish cemeteries.  Cuomo, who visited Israel in a   act of solidarity, said the wave of antisemitism \u201cviolates every tenet of the New York State tradition. \u201d \u201cNew York State by its definition is a celebration of diversity, it accepts all who believe in the spirit of inclusion and who live by discrimination of none. New York\u2019s principles are built on a rock, they will not change, and the political wind will not change them,\u201d he said. His state, he said, has \u201cput together a special unit of the state police\u201d to deal with the issue, and has \u201creacted aggressively with extraordinary measures, more aggressively than any other state in the nation\u201d to the attacks. New York has the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. \u201cWe have made it clear that there will be no tolerance for these acts of antisemitism,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cMy sadness is that now another generation of young people has had to experience this pain,\u201d he said. \u201cA pain that for many young people was only in the history books is now very much in their daily lives. These acts of antisemitism have also transpired on college campuses, so an entirely new generation has been exposed. \u201d Cuomo, who toured Yad Vashem with President Reuven Rivlin, said the   trip to Israel had two main goals: \u201cNumber one, while some would weaken the relationship between the people of the State of New York and our Jewish brothers and sisters, the purpose of this trip is to strengthen those relationships through cultural exchange [and] through economic development partnerships, and we\u2019ll be working on them. \u201d Using the Hebrew word for \u201chere I am,\u201d he added, \u201cThe second purpose of this trip is \u2018Hineini.\u2019 I am here, I have been here before, and I will be here again. \u201d Rivlin praised Cuomo for his solidarity, saying that it is \u201can extremely important signal that the U. S. people and government will not let antisemitism win. \u201d Rivlin added that Israel was indebted to President Donald Trump for his condemnation of the attacks, in addition to the words and gestures of Vice President Mike Pence, who visited a vandalized Jewish cemetery in St. Louis. During the Holocaust, the president noted, the U. S. was a \u201crare island of safety\u201d for the Jews. \u201cWe can never, ever, let that change,\u201d he added. Cuomo will also meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, visit the Western Wall and attend a security briefing at Jerusalem\u2019s Old City Police Headquarters before heading back to the U. S. on Monday.'"}, "time": 1742563423.3151257}
