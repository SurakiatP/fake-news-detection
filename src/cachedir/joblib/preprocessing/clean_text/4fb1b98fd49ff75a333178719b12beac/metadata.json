[At @Portland_State interfaith panel today, the Muslim student speaker said that apostates will be killed or banished in an Islamic state. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Andy C. Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) April 27, 2017,   Student journalist Andy Ngo, a graduate student at Portland State University, was fired from his job at the school\u2019s student newspaper after a video he tweeted of a campus interfaith panel was included in a report from Breitbart News. The video, which went viral on social media, showed a Muslim student stating that   or apostates, would either be banished or killed in countries run under Islamic law. \u201cThat is only considered a crime when the country is based on Koranic law,\u201d the student said, speaking about the legality of being a   in an Islamic country. \u201cThat means there is no other law than the Koran. So in that case, you are given the liberty to leave the country. You can go to a different country. I am not going to sugarcoat it. So if you go to a different country  \u2026    but in a Muslim country, a country based on Koranic law, disbelieving or being an infidel, is not allowed, so you will be given the choice. \u201d Ngo was dismissed by the editors of the Vanguard student newspaper, who claimed that he had recklessly endangered the Muslim panelist\u2019s life by portraying the student\u2019s remarks inaccurately. An editor of the Vanguard allegedly told Ngo that his conduct was \u201cpredatory\u201d and \u201creckless,\u201d before ultimately chastising him for the inclusion of his video tweet in a report that appeared on Breitbart News on April 27. Four days later, the    of my school newspaper called me into a meeting. The paper\u2019s managing editor was also present. They asked me about a Breitbart piece describing the event. It was the first time I\u2019d seen the piece, which included my tweets and a tweet from one of the panelists. My editor, whom I deeply respected at the time, called me \u201cpredatory\u201d and \u201creckless,\u201d telling me I had put the life and   of the Muslim student and his family at risk. She said that my tweets implied the student advocated the killing of atheists. Another person in the meeting said I should have taken into account the plight of victimized groups in the \u201ccurrent political climate. \u201d The editor claimed I had \u201cviolated the paper\u2019s ethical standards\u201d by not \u201cminimizing harm\u201d toward the speaker. Writing in The National Review, Ngo defended himself by claiming that he had simply reported on what the panelist had said. Despite this, Ngo was fired from his position, with the editors arguing that his history of affiliation with conservative media was harmful to the Vanguard\u2019s reputation. In my defense, I told the two editors that I had simply been relating the speaker\u2019s words. While dozens of Muslim states do not consider apostasy or blasphemy a crime, 13   countries punish these actions with death. The speaker was admitting as much, and as someone who has covered the persecution of atheists and apostates in Muslim countries, I considered that newsworthy. Nevertheless, my editor turned to me and said, \u201cWe have to ask you to step aside. \u201d She said I had \u201ca history\u201d of affiliation with conservative media, and argued that that history was toxic to the \u201creputation of the Vanguard. \u201d The Vanguard wrote on the interfaith panel on May 1, condemning Mr. Ngo\u2019s reporting in the process, claiming that the video he had shared on Twitter was shared without the proper context. A video clip featuring only a portion of the organizer\u2019s quote that addressed the Quranic law about   or infidels being \u201cgiven a choice\u201d has been shared on Twitter and Facebook without the preceding and following context. This comment from the organizer, widely shared out of context was met with significant criticism by audience members who accessed it through social media and   media outlets. Benjamin Ramey, a student on the interfaith panel, argued that Mr. Ngo didn\u2019t take the Muslim panelist\u2019s comments out of context. Speaking to Breitbart News, Ramey stated that \u201cit is discouraging to see a student funded publication use their platform inappropriately to publicly slander the name of their now former Multimedia Editor, Andy Ngo, in order to shield themselves from their own apprehension to engage in equitable dialogue about atheism and religion in the modern world. \u201d \u201cIf one wishes to shy away from such talk, let them, but that individual cannot force those around them to keep silent as well,\u201d he added. @MrAndyNgo @Portland_State As one of the panelists present at this event I would like to say that this speech is not taken out of context.  \u2014   Benjamin Ramey (@NikolaosRamey) April 27, 2017,  Ngo initially offered his   to the Vanguard following his dismissal but they refused, claiming it would cause the Muslim panelist \u201cfurther distress. \u201d Instead, Vanguard    Colleen Leary penned a column defending her decision to dismiss Ngo. In the column, Leary argued that Ngo\u2019s tweet, which wasn\u2019t published in his official capacity as a Vanguard journalist, was \u201ca dangerous oversimplification that violated very clear ethics outlined by the Society of Professional Journalists. \u201d Andy Ngo spoke with Breitbart London    Raheem Kassam on Breitbart XM on Sunday. In the interview, Ngo agrees with Kassam\u2019s assessment that he was fired by the editors of the Vanguard \u201cbasically because this was covered by Breitbart. \u201d You can listen to the entire segment below.
