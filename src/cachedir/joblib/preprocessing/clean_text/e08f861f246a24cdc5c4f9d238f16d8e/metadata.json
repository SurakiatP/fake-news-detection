He wouldn\\'t be seen dead in a Wilkinsons\", prompting park staff to believe he\\'d be in the local Waitrose or John Lewis. \\nEye witnesses report the animal \"briefly explored the Whole Foods aisle before heading over to the fruit section for some organic bananas\" \\nHe then skipped past the own brand squash and went straight for the full-priced Robinsons. He was discovered \\'having opened and drank five litres of undiluted Robinsons blackcurrant squash, eaten 47 jars of palm oil free peanut butter and holding a basket full of soy and linseed bread\\', the report revealed. \\nIt concluded that the gorilla was always very conscious of where he shops and tries to make ethical choices where he can, even if he is a bit of a sucker for Robinsons squash. \\nKumbuka was returned to his den shortly after being tranquilised. \\nKumbuka arrived in London from Paignton Zoo in Devon in early 2013.
