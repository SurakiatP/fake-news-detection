But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.\u201d Jude 1:8,10 (KJV) \\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: When they were postive that Hillary would win, they practically tripped over themselves spouting \u201cpeace, love and tolerance\u201d. They shouted \u201c when they go low, we go high \u201d from the mountain tops 24 hours per day. Now that they\u2019ve lost the election, their rallying cry has shifted to calls for rape and assassination of the First Lady and President-Elect Trumps. Kinda curious how Michelle and Barack Obama have been silent on condemning the protesters. \\nOutside the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., a protester held up a sign saying \u2018RAPE MELANIA,\u2019 which went viral.

Furious users accused the site of censoring the explosive DNC Wikileaks story in July after #DNCLeaks, with over a quarter million tweets, vanished from the Trending section, replaced by the far less popular #DNCLeak. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.
