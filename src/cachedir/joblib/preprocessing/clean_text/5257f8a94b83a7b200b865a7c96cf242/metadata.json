Electricians installed security cameras on the redesigned plaza as carpenters put the finishing touches on a new cafe. Lex Horth, an amateur photographer from Gates Mills, an affluent village nearby, snapped photos and marveled at downtown\u2019s newest jewel. \u201cI haven\u2019t come down here in 25 or 30 years because it was so derelict,\u201d said Ms. Horth, 80, adding that she was blown away by \u201cwhat Cleveland has done. \u201d Twenty minutes south, in a neighborhood called Slavic Village, Robert Smith and David Rajecki, both    disabled factory workers, surveyed a vastly different scene. Historically a bustling center of Czech and Polish immigrant life, Slavic Village was sliding into decay even before it was devastated by the  foreclosure crisis. Now many of its homes are boarded up. The barber on Fleet Avenue has bullet fragments in his leg rival gangs burst in last year and fired shots. Mr. Rajecki, missing teeth, cannot afford dentures. Mr. Smith calls the neighborhood \u201ca dive\u201d  \u2014   \u201cyou don\u2019t even got a bowling alley anymore,\u201d he said  \u2014   and Cleveland \u201ca broke city. \u201d As Republicans gather in Cleveland to nominate Donald J. Trump for president, and Democrats in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton, the nation is in the thick of searing debates over terrorism, race and policing, gun violence and immigration. But the host cities, both in Rust Belt swing states, spotlight something Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton rarely discuss: the plight of urban America. Amid a widening gap between rich and poor, nothing screams income inequality louder than cities, including Cleveland and Philadelphia, case studies in renewal and gentrification, but also in crushing decline. And perhaps no Americans capture as well as those who live in and advocate for these cities the feeling that the nation\u2019s present cannot match its past. In Washington last week, the National League of Cities released a report warning that \u201cthe promise of cities will be stifled\u201d if issues like access to jobs, racial discrimination and gun violence were not addressed. In Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat elected last year, wants \u201ca comprehensive national program to bring our cities back. \u201d Here in Cleveland, Kurt Karakul, president of Third Federal Foundation, a nonprofit that works to improve Slavic Village, is furious at the attention paid to \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d investment downtown, while the neighborhood he is trying to help is so poor, he said, that every public school student qualifies for free or   lunch. \u201cYou talk about third world countries? We\u2019re not that far behind here, with the circumstances that people have to live in,\u201d said Mr. Karakul, a former lawyer. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I don\u2019t see much coming out of any of the campaigns on what we can do for poverty. \u201d Once symbols of American industrial might and prosperity, Cleveland and Philadelphia are among the poorest cities in the nation. In 2014, Philadelphia had the highest poverty rate (26 percent) among cities with more than a million people, while Cleveland has the   poverty rate (39. 2 percent) among cities with more than 100, 000 residents, according to census data analyzed by the Brookings Institution. Cleveland also has exceedingly high rates of \u201cconcentrated poverty\u201d  \u2014   poor people living in poor neighborhoods. Both cities have very segregated   populations, according to William H. Frey, a Brookings demographer. In both, there are tensions between blacks and police the Cleveland Police Department operates under a federal consent decree. Like other World War   manufacturing hubs  \u2014   Pittsburgh, Detroit, Milwaukee, Baltimore and even Boston and New York  \u2014   Philadelphia and Cleveland hollowed out during the latter half of the 20th century, losing jobs and people. Today, both cities rely on \u201ceds and meds\u201d  \u2014   educational and medical institutions  \u2014   as engines for jobs and growth. But while Boston and New York had started to rebound in the 1990s, Philadelphia and especially Cleveland have had slower rebirths. In 1950, Philadelphia was the nation\u2019s   city, with a population of nearly 2. 1 million, and Cleveland was seventh, at about 915, 000. By 2010, Philadelphia was down to about 1. 5 million and Cleveland to fewer than 400, 000. Since then, Cleveland\u2019s population has dropped more, while Philadelphia\u2019s has ticked up  \u2014   a sign of what Rolf Pendall, a scholar at the Urban Institute in Washington, called \u201ca comeback story. \u201d But some see the comeback as overrated. \u201cThe conventioneers will come here, and they won\u2019t get away from the stadium or the downtown  \u2014   they\u2019ll think they are in a comeback city,\u201d said Ira Goldstein, who supervises research for Reinvestment Fund, a   nonprofit investor in community development. But he said other neighborhoods \u201chave regressed over the last 10, 12 years. \u201d Sitting on a park bench in Rittenhouse Square, Richard Kahr, a retired real estate developer from Manhattan, said Philadelphia had \u201cmassively changed\u201d since he arrived a decade ago. But he is troubled by \u201ctwo classes\u201d in the city, and the nation  \u2014   \u201cthe people that like their life, and the people fighting for their life. \u201d Mantua, a proud but downtrodden West Philadelphia neighborhood whose rich   history is chronicled in colorful murals, is where those two classes may one day meet. Mantua is part of a \u201cPromise Zone,\u201d an Obama administration initiative to help poor communities. Nearly   of Mantua households have incomes below $25, 000 the typical home sells for between $10, 000 and $15, 000, Mr. Goldstein said. But Mantua also has a wealthy neighbor: Drexel University. Jimmy Allen, a retired teacher and 1960s street gang leader who functions as Mantua\u2019s de facto mayor, knows its ills:   houses, drug addiction, struggling schools. And he knows its strengths: leaders with deep community roots. But what Mr. Allen, 68, frets most over are its vacant lots. Mantua is overrun with large grassy tracts where homes once stood many have been purchased by developers and speculators. Separately, John A. Fry, the Drexel president, has just unveiled an ambitious plan: a $3. 5 billion,   development of parks, businesses and   to be built over four decades, connecting the campus to 30th Street Station, the nearby railroad hub. A former management consultant, Mr. Fry has worked hard to enlist neighborhood support in 2014 Drexel opened a community center in a renovated mansion, with a computer lab and playground. Mr. Fry wants neighborhoods that surround Drexel to \u201cbecome stronger and better versions of themselves\u201d  \u2014   a vision he says can coexist with his effort to \u201cposition Philadelphia as a place of enormous growth and development. \u201d Mr. Allen is unconvinced. He worries that speculators will move in, destroying the neighborhood\u2019s character. \u201cDrexel has a law department we can\u2019t afford a lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how are you going fight the dragon? You can only duck and dodge, and hope you survive. \u201d That tension over gentrification is the story of many old industrial cities here in Cleveland it is playing out in Ohio City, where lively restaurants and boutiques are attracting hipsters and millennials. Syrian, Lebanese and Egyptian vendors sell fruit and vegetables at the popular West Side Market there. \u201cI take master\u2019s degree in my country  \u2014   now I sell fruit,\u201d said Chrestina Sedrak, a former psychology teacher who fled Cairo during the 2011 uprising. While Ms. Sedrak sees opportunity, Narrin   52, who survived the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and arrived here in 1981, is less upbeat. The restaurants and shops are bringing in customers, but sales at her spice shop are flat customers look but do not buy. Eli Fletcher, 56, a musician who strolls the market in a caped crusader costume and calls himself \u201cGuitar Man\u201d (\u201cI save Cleveland one song at a time\u201d) can no longer afford to live in Ohio City, where he grew up, the son of a former coal miner who left West Virginia for Cleveland seeking factory work. \u201cThis whole gentrification thing forgets that this is a   city, and not some posh resort,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said. As both cities look toward their moment in the spotlight, John Grabowski, a historian at Case Western Reserve University here, cautions against too much nostalgia cities, after all, are living things. Mr. Grabowski, editor of an encyclopedia of Cleveland history, grew up in Slavic Village. His boyhood home fell into disrepair after his family left, and was eventually burned. Today it is an empty lot. Returning there one recent afternoon, he could not help but grow misty. The old neighborhood where he played on the railroad tracks  \u2014   \u201cwe used to grease the tracks and watch the wheels spin like crazy\u201d  \u2014   now resembles \u201cempty spaces between somebody\u2019s teeth. \u201d About 70, 000 people lived in Slavic Village at its peak the population is roughly 23, 000 now. \u201cYou have a housing stock that\u2019s dysfunctional, a population that\u2019s migrated out and an economy that\u2019s flat,\u201d said Tony Brancatelli, a city councilman. \u201cThen you layer on the foreclosure crisis and it\u2019s the kiss of death. \u201d Still, there are bright spots. The local bank Third Federal Savings and Loan  \u2014   whose owners, descendants of Polish immigrants, started the foundation Mr. Karakul runs  \u2014   is helping to build and finance new homes that sell for as much as $130, 000. On Fleet Avenue, a popcorn maker who sells his treats at the West Side Market is planning a new manufacturing plant. And on Broadway Avenue, in a   butcher shop, a maker of cured meat and sausage is moving in. Mr. Brancatelli, who sees the foreclosure crisis and its fallout as the root of \u201csocial unrest,\u201d said the national conversation around \u201cold industrial cities\u201d like Cleveland had changed  \u2014   for the worse. Eight years ago, when Barack Obama ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, they debated in Cleveland and their advisers participated in a forum on housing at City Hall. \u201cNow we are not hearing a peep about it,\u201d Mr. Brancatelli said. \u201cIt scares the heck out of me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564554.3989878}
