That\u2019s the truth about quantitative easing. We need to have somebody who knows what\u2019s going on in the big picture here and has a game plan to get rid of this fiscal gap, and do it without total chaos. If we leave things the way they are, people will view the country as leaderless fundamentally and printing money to pay its bills. \\nThen, the expectation will occur, and that\u2019s going to raise rates, and that\u2019s going to drop bond prices, and that will sink the banks, and, yes, you can have another great recession like Bill Gross is referencing (bond super nova). I\u2019ve been saying this for decades. The time for the last straw to drop on the camel\u2019s back, and when it\u2019s going to drop that camel is hard to say.
