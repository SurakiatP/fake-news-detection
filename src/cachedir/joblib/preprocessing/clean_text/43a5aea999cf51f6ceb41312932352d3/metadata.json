At Vanderbilt University, John Anthony Capra, an evolutionary genomics professor, has been combining   computation and a medical records databank to learn what a Neanderthal heritage  \u2014   even a fractional one  \u2014   might mean for people today. We spoke for two hours when Dr. Capra, 35, recently passed through New York City. An edited and condensed version of the conversation follows. Q. Let\u2019s begin with an indiscreet question. How did contemporary people come to have Neanderthal DNA on their genomes? A. We hypothesize that roughly 50, 000 years ago, when the ancestors of modern humans migrated out of Africa and into Eurasia, they encountered Neanderthals. Matings must have occurred then. And later. One reason we deduce this is because the descendants of those who remained in Africa  \u2014   present day Africans  \u2014   don\u2019t have Neanderthal DNA. What does that mean for people who have it?  At my lab, we\u2019ve been doing genetic testing on the blood samples of 28, 000 patients at Vanderbilt and eight other medical centers across the country. Computers help us pinpoint where on the human genome this Neanderthal DNA is, and we run that against information from the patients\u2019 anonymized medical records. We\u2019re looking for associations. What we\u2019ve been finding is that Neanderthal DNA has a subtle influence on risk for disease. It affects our immune system and how we respond to different immune challenges. It affects our skin. You\u2019re slightly more prone to a condition where you can get scaly lesions after extreme sun exposure. There\u2019s an increased risk for blood clots and tobacco addiction. To our surprise, it appears that some Neanderthal DNA can increase the risk for depression however, there are other Neanderthal bits that decrease the risk. Roughly 1 to 2 percent of one\u2019s risk for depression is determined by Neanderthal DNA. It all depends on where on the genome it\u2019s located. Was there ever an upside to having Neanderthal DNA?  It probably helped our ancestors survive in prehistoric Europe. When humans migrated into Eurasia, they encountered unfamiliar hazards and pathogens. By mating with Neanderthals, they gave their offspring needed defenses and immunities. That trait for blood clotting helped wounds close up quickly. In the modern world, however, this trait means greater risk for stroke and pregnancy complications. What helped us then doesn\u2019t necessarily now. Did you say earlier that Neanderthal DNA increases susceptibility to nicotine addiction? Yes. Neanderthal DNA can mean you\u2019re more likely to get hooked on nicotine, even though there were no tobacco plants in archaic Europe. We think this might be because there\u2019s a bit of Neanderthal DNA right next to a human gene that\u2019s a neurotransmitter implicated in a generalized risk for addiction. In this case and probably others, we think the Neanderthal bits on the genome may serve as switches that turn human genes on or off. Aside from the Neanderthals, do we know if our ancestors mated with other hominids? We think they did. Sometimes when we\u2019re examining genomes, we can see the genetic afterimages of hominids who haven\u2019t even been identified yet. A few years ago, the Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo received an unusual fossilized bone fragment from Siberia. He extracted the DNA, sequenced it and realized it was neither human nor Neanderthal. What Paabo found was a previously unknown hominid he named Denisovan, after the cave where it had been discovered. It turned out that Denisovan DNA can be found on the genomes of modern Southeast Asians and New Guineans. Have you long been interested in genetics? Growing up, I was very interested in history, but I also loved computers. I ended up majoring in computer science at college and going to graduate school in it however, during my first year in graduate school, I realized I wasn\u2019t very motivated by the problems that computer scientists worked on. Fortunately, around that time  \u2014   the early 2000s  \u2014   it was becoming clear that people with computational skills could have a big impact in biology and genetics. The human genome had just been mapped. What an accomplishment! We now had the code to what makes you, you, and me, me. I wanted to be part of that kind of work. So I switched over to biology. And it was there that I heard about a new field where you used computation and genetics research to look back in time  \u2014   evolutionary genomics. There may be no written records from prehistory, but genomes are a living record. If we can find ways to read them, we can discover things we couldn\u2019t know any other way. Not long ago, the two top editors of The New England Journal of Medicine published an editorial questioning \u201cdata sharing,\u201d a common practice where scientists recycle raw data other researchers have collected for their own studies. They labeled some of the recycling researchers, \u201cdata parasites. \u201d How did you feel when you read that?  I was upset. The data sets we used were not originally collected to specifically study Neanderthal DNA in modern humans. Thousands of patients at Vanderbilt consented to have their blood and their medical records deposited in a \u201cbiobank\u201d to find genetic diseases. Three years ago, when I set up my lab at Vanderbilt, I saw the potential of the biobank for studying both genetic diseases and human evolution. I wrote special computer programs so that we could mine existing data for these purposes. That\u2019s not being a \u201cparasite. \u201d That\u2019s moving knowledge forward. I suspect that most of the patients who contributed their information are pleased to see it used in a wider way. What has been the response to your Neanderthal research since you published it last year in the journal Science?  Some of it\u2019s very touching. People are interested in learning about where they came from. Some of it is a little silly. \u201cI have a lot of hair on my legs  \u2014   is that from Neanderthals?\u201d But I received racist inquiries, too. I got calls from all over the world from people who thought that since Africans didn\u2019t interbreed with Neanderthals, this somehow justified their ideas of white superiority. It was illogical. Actually, Neanderthal DNA is mostly bad for us  \u2014   though that didn\u2019t bother them. As you do your studies, do you ever wonder about what the lives of the Neanderthals were like? It\u2019s hard not to. Genetics has taught us a tremendous amount about that, and there\u2019s a lot of evidence that they were much more human than apelike. They\u2019ve gotten a bad rap. We tend to think of them as dumb and brutish. There\u2019s no reason to believe that. Maybe those of us of European heritage should be thinking, \u201cLet\u2019s improve their standing in the popular imagination. They\u2019re our ancestors, too. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564003.7114675}
