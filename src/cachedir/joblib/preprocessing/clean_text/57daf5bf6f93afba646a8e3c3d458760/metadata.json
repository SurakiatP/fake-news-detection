It\u2019s a life most of us can never imagine while we\u2019re paying our monthly bills. So what\u2019s it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star\u2019s son wasn\u2019t what one might imagine. Or, given Trump\u2019s temperament, it might be exactly what you\u2019d imagine. \\nOn Facebook , Mekler told of the animosity Trump\u2019s son had for this father. \\n\u201cI was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr.\u2019s room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son\u2019s door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey.\u201d \\nThen Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. \\n\u201cWithout saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said \u201cput on a suit and meet me outside,\u201d and closed the door,\u201d Melker wrote. \\n\u201cDonald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was \u201cDiaper Don,\u201d because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people\u2019s beds and urinate.\u201d \u201cI always felt terrible for him,\u201d he continued. \\nMekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because \u201cin light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country.\u201d \\nTo be clear, we are not demonizing Trump\u2019s son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker\u2019s story is accurate or not, we\u2019re not sure, but given Trump\u2019s awful temper, it\u2019s difficult to discount it. \\nPhoto by Saul Loeb-Pool via Getty. Share this Article!
