John Lewis ( .) joined his \u201coppressors\u201d in the Democratic Party and has since assisted in the \u201cdestruction of black America. \u201d[\u201cHe was fighting Democrats. And after they beat his behind on the [Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965] and ran over him and stumped him in the ground, he got up and turned and joined,\u201d Weaver said Monday on Tucker Carlson Tonight.   \u201cHe joined the oppressors and became a stooge for them,\u201d Weaver said of Lewis, who is \u201cnow sitting and presiding over the destruction of the black community the destruction of black men the destruction of black women, with drugs and gangs. \u201d \u201cHe more concerned about Trump being the illegitimate President,\u201d Weaver said, \u201cbut John Lewis is the illegitimate Congressman. \u201d Weaver was responding to the war of words between   Donald Trump and Rep. Lewis. On Friday, Lewis described Trump\u2019s election as \u201cillegitimate\u201d because of a Russian \u201cconspiracy. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see the   as a legitimate president. I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians, and others, that helped him get elected,\u201d Lewis told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd. Trump fired back, urging the Georgia Democrat to \u201cspend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. \u201d However, Weaver believes the spotlight should be turned on the longtime Democratic lawmaker and his record. \u201cHe has presided over the worst school system in the world, where black people are learning to only be gang prep,\u201d Weaver said of Lewis. \u201cI\u2019m outraged that the demonstration that he had early in his life has turned into a subjugation of his right and authority as a black leader. \u201d Weaver says not only has Lewis failed his constituents  \u2014   which consist of most of Atlanta, Georgia  \u2014   but the \u201cCongressional Communist Black Caucus that has every district they own and control is a ghetto hellhole. \u201d Weaver challenged Rep. Lewis to \u201capologize\u201d to the American people for joining the Democratic \u201cparty of abuse,\u201d which has \u201calways been the party of the Klan the party that went to war to keep slaves the party that\u2019s always been the destruction of black people. \u201d Rep. Lewis \u201chas gotten rich and his people have gotten poorer,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThe black caucus has gotten more power and influence, and the black people they preside over have gotten poorer  \u2014   more drugs, more gangs, less businesses, less home ownership, less education, more jails. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742563072.2686021}
