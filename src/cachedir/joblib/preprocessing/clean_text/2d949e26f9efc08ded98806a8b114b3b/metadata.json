[The head of the Italian Eurosceptic party also told Die Welt he\u2019s proud to be a populist and, noting that Europe has never been so \u201csoft\u201d warned that the continent is in danger of losing its identity and values.  Speaking to the German broadsheet, Salvini said the charge of populism is nothing to be ashamed of, and confirmed his status as a fan of   Donald Trump. The Lega Nord (Northern League) leader said accusations of populism are a \u201ccompliment\u201d and a \u201creason to be proud\u201d. \u201cI have a shirt [emblazoned on which are the] words \u2018I am a populist\u2019\u201d he revealed, dismissing Die Welt\u2019s assertion that the term is an insult. \u201cOriginally, the term meant one who is close to the people, and speaks the common language,\u201d Salvini added. The mass sex attacks by mobs of migrants in Cologne last New Year \u201cwere in a sense a forewarning\u201d of the truck attack in Berlin that went unheeded, the Italian politician said. \u201cWe are being attacked and so must resolutely expel all those who have no right to live [in Europe]\u201d he said, and argued that Germany\u2019s lacklustre response to the mass sexual assaults was a mistake. \u201cIf you want to live in peace, you have to prepare for war,\u201d the Lega Nord leader added. \u201cEurope is losing its values and identity, it\u2019s lacking security and has lost its sense of pride\u201d Salvini said, and spoke of a \u201cculture war\u201d taking place on the continent. \u201cChristmas is Christmas because Jesus Christ was born. Why should we be ashamed of our traditions?\u201d the populist Italian said, and criticised how, in many Italian schools, Christmas festivities have been replaced with multicultural \u2018peace\u2019 festivals. Salvini said there should be no room for \u201cfanatics\u201d in Europe, and noted that \u201conly the law of Allah is valid\u201d for a number of Muslim migrants who reject secular laws. \u201cThe problem is not with individuals but the culture of Islam\u201d the   migration politician stated, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s backward, and not compatible with our society. \u201d Noting that 95 per cent of the new arrivals in Italy are economic migrants from Africa, Salvini said the money Italy is spending on putting them up in hotels is being \u201cthrown out of the window\u201d. Far better, he asserted, that the money go towards deals with African governments in which Italy invests in infrastructure in return for an end to migrant flows and easy return of illegal infiltrators. More than half a million migrants arrived in Italy by boat in 2016. In response, the globalist, social democratic government has seized hotels across the country, using them to house migrants against the wishes of their owners. In November, Breitbart London reported on how locals in Turin were left terrified when migrants squatting in the city\u2019s former Olympic village, now a hotbed of crime, took to the streets to protest \u201cracist Italians\u201d. Screaming threats and throwing projectiles, the migrants hailed the Bataclan massacre, in which 89 people were murdered, as a \u201crevenge of the excluded\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742564138.4884336}
