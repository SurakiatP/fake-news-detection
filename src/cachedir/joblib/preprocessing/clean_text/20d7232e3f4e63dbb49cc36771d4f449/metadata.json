[Asserting that Britain\u2019s judiciary has a \u201cdiversity deficit\u201d law reform group Justice called for \u201csystemic structural changes\u201d to the selection process including \u201ctargets with teeth\u201d so as to \u201cdeliver sufficient diversity to the bench\u201d.  As well as describing diversity as an \u201cintrinsic good\u201d the report said the \u201clack of female and visible [black and ethnic minority] senior judges threatens to erode the public\u2019s confidence in the judiciary\u201d warning it could be perceived to be \u201cunfair\u201d that in the Crown Court \u201cthose tried are disproportionately   yet the judges are overwhelmingly white\u201d. The   group said \u201cpositive action\u201d must be taken to increase the share of women and ethnic minorities in the judiciary, stating: \u201c\u2018Merit\u2019 can all too easily become a vehicle for unconscious bias. \u201d Justice director Andrea Coomber said: \u201cWe realise that some of the measures recommended in this report will be unpopular with some, but if the   issue of lack of diversity is to be genuinely addressed then those at the most senior levels must accept that difficult and perhaps unpopular decisions will have to be taken to deliver a more diverse judiciary. \u201d Noting the majority of supreme court judges will be replaced over the next three years, Coomber said there is now an \u201cunprecedented opportunity\u201d to \u201cchange swiftly the demographic composition of [Britain\u2019s] senior judiciary\u201d. Justice recommends setting ambitious \u201ctargets with teeth\u201d for courts deemed to lack sufficient numbers of women or ethnic minorities, the \u201cteeth\u201d meaning that there would be obligations to monitor and report on progress. The report said: \u201cIf there is persistent failure to meet targets over the next decade, strong consideration should be given to introducing quotas. \u201cStructural change  \u2014   not tinkering  \u2014   is required if the complexion of the bench is to really change. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628523.4399154}
