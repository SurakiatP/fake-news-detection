Reid concluded that the FBI director violated this act by sending his letter to Congress days before Election Day. \\nReid stated that according to CBS News ,\u201cYour actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another,\u201d Then he added that that through Comey\u2019s \u201cpartisan actions, you may have broken the law.\u201d Harry Reid: FBI Director Comey\u2019s \u2018Partisan Actions\u2019 May Violate Federal Law \u2013 Letter: pic.twitter.com/agXy4D1igh \\n\u2014 Ryan Ruggiero (@RyanRuggiero) October 30, 2016 \\nViolations of the Hatch Act are a serious offense (you might recall this, because numerous Obama Administration officials have been accused of violating the federal law with zero action taken against them. \\n\u201c[Y]our highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group,\u201d Reid wrote. \\nIn providing examples of what he claims are a violation of the Hatch Act, Reid pointed to the \u201cselective approach:\u201d Comey\u2019s refusal to of investigate Trump and his possible campaign ties to the Russian government. \\n\u201cIn my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government \u2013 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cI wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public\u2026 and yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.\u201d \\n\u201cYou\u2019re rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton,\u201d he said. \\nThe Hatch Act is a federal law that was passed in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to limit federal agencies or its employees from interfering with political activities or federally funded programs. \\nThis means federal employees can\u2019t hold fund-raisers for politicians or receive donations, but they can vote for or against candidates running in an election, the law states. \\nReid ended the letter reminding the director that he used to be a supporter of Comey\u2019s \u2013 even when Republicans filibustered his nomination as FBI chief: \u201cI led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant,\u201d Reid concluded. \u201cWith the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.\u201d \\nIn all actuality, Comey told Congress that even though he wasn\u2019t \u201cclosing the case\u201d in the FBI probe of Hillary\u2019s emails, he was still ending the investigation. \\nIronically can you imagine if he hadn\u2019t sent the letter? With the recent revelations, had he not sent a letter to Congress, he would have been blamed for attempting to lie to Congress and cover-up further investigation. As it stands, by sending the letter, he is simply accused of partisanship by sending the letter. \\nI\u2019d say he\u2019s damned if he does and damned if he doesn\u2019t. \\nI little suspicion that Comey has a backbone MUCH stronger than Harry Reid or any of his spineless Democratic accusers now. \\nWhat an act of desperation on the Democrats part. Hillary is doing nothing but grasping at straws, whether or not anything comes of this new investigation before the election, we\u2019ll see, but to actually accuse Comey of treason, is utter idiocy.
