The city also   and made it illegal to deny someone services because they are an illegal alien. City officials deny that Columbus is a \u201csanctuary city. \u201d[The Columbus Dispatch reported that the Columbus City Council voted to adopt an executive order issued by Mayor Andrew J. Ginther in early February.  After he signed the executive order, Mayor Ginther told those at a press conference, \u201cTo all of you I say, Columbus is your home. \u201d The mayor\u2019s executive order provided that the city will \u201cactively support, to the greatest extent practicable, the placement or settlement in this jurisdiction of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. \u201d The room was full of leaders from the city\u2019s refugee and immigrant communities, the local NBC affiliate reported.  The mayor\u2019s order dictates: Although the policy prevents the City or employees from using any city property for detecting or apprehending those illegally in the country, or \u201cthe use of local taxpayer resources for the enforcement of federal immigration policy,\u201d city officials do not declare Columbus a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d reported the Dispatch. \u201c[T]hey don\u2019t want the city a target for President Donald Trump, who has threatened federal funding for cities that adopt the label,\u201d the article written Monday afternoon about the ordinance and city officials reported. The president of the city council, Zach Klein was reported to say that \u201cThe permanence of city code transcends every mayor. \u201d \u201cWe decided not to focus on labels and focus more on the substance,\u201d he added. The ordinance will be effective after 30 days. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas. He is a founding member of the Breitbart Texas team.
