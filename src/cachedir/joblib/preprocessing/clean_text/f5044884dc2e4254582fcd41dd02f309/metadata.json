For many years the German Saker blog has been one of the most successful and dedicated blogs of our community and we want to sincerely thank Dagmar Henn for the superb job she did as the person in charge of this blog. Recently, however, the German Saker blog has taken a very different tone and has made a number of accusations and statements which have convinced us that we need to part ways. We do that with great sadness. We reserve the right to start another \u201ccommunity approved\u201d German Saker blog in the future with a different domain name and we express the hope that the current administrators of the so-called \u201csaker.de 2.0\u2033 will agree to stop using the word \u201csaker\u201d in their domain and blog name. Any future use of that word by the \u201csaker.de 2.0\u2033 would be morally illegitimate and misleading. \\nSigned: French Saker blog, Italian Saker blog, Latin American Saker blog, Oceania Saker blog, Russian Saker blog, Serbian Saker blog, The Saker The Essential Saker: from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world $27.95 '"}, "time": 1742561671.1075258}
