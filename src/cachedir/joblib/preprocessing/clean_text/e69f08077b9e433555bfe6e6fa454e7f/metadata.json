The car\u2019s windows and posters were covered in   graffiti, according to accounts from Mr. Locke and another passenger in the car, Jared Nied. Messages like \u201cJews belong in the oven\u201d and \u201cdestroy Israel, Heil Hitler,\u201d had been written over subway maps, as shown by photographs taken on the train. Swastikas were drawn in black marker on the doors and windows. Mr. Locke, 27, a New York lawyer, said in a phone interview that his first reaction was shock, \u201cespecially once I realized how many instances of graffiti were on the train car. \u201d \u201cBut the shock quickly subsides and turns into a sort of a realistic horror,\u201d he said. \u201cYou realize it\u2019s appalling but it\u2019s also not surprising at the same time. \u201d Neither man reported the graffiti to the police, and neither the New York Police Department nor the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had a record of any report. Mr. Nied, 36, was returning home from his work as a   around 7 p. m. and boarded the train at 42nd Street. He said in a phone interview that his reaction to the graffiti, which he noticed immediately, must have been written on his face, and he soon attracted the attention of another commuter. \u201cThere was a lady sitting across from me under the map, and she said, \u2018Oh that\u2019s absolutely horrible,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Do you think there\u2019s any way we can erase it? \u2019\u201d Mr. Nied had many times used a Sharpie when he had meant to use a   marker, and he knew from experience that alcohol would work to erase the graffiti. \u201cA light bulb went on, and I just asked, \u2018Does anyone have hand sanitizer? \u2019\u201d he said. Mr. Nied and several other commuters began to wipe away the graffiti, their actions captured in photographs taken by Mr. Locke, who wrote on Facebook about his experience. By late Sunday afternoon, more than 518, 000 people had reacted to the post on Facebook, and the post had been shared more than 354, 000 times. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and Purell,\u201d Mr. Locke wrote. \u201cWithin about two minutes, all the Nazi symbolism was gone. \u201d Mr. Nied said that the episode had lasted less than five minutes and that the passengers were able to erase the graffiti before the train reached 96th Street. He returned a bottle of hand sanitizer to one of the riders, apologizing for having used most of it. \u201cWe sat down and glanced around at each other and settled back into the commute,\u201d he said. Both men said they understood that there might be skepticism about their accounts. \u201cI understand the criticism, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t have an answer for it,\u201d Mr. Locke said. \u201cI would probably be suspicious, too, if I didn\u2019t take the pictures. \u201d Detective Ahmed Nasser of the New York Police Department said that while the episode had not been reported on Saturday, other reports of   graffiti had been logged recently: A recycling container downtown was reportedly defaced with the words \u201cJews are a virus\u201d in black ink in January, and swastikas were found etched on a northbound F train this month. A separate episode, in which a passenger on a B train saw that a swastika on an American flag had been transformed into a message of love, drew a comment from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday. On Saturday night, Mr. Nied sent a text to his wife, Jacquline, and to a friend with a photograph of the graffiti, but he did not consider the prospect that someone else might have taken photos. He said it had not even crossed his mind until more than an hour later, when his wife looked at her phone. \u201cShe said, \u2018Dude, you\u2019re going viral,\u2019\u201d he recalled. He added: \u201cIt was a very New York moment in that we all came together, we all teamed up, and then we settled back down. I don\u2019t think any of those people really spoke, truth be told. Everyone kind of just did their jobs of being decent human beings. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628417.2238433}
