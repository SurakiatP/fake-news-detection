Trump on Tuesday to be more forthcoming about his health, taking aim at Mr. Trump over an issue he has tried to use to undermine Mrs. Clinton. As part of a lengthy critique of Mr. Trump, Mr. Kaine mocked a   letter signed last year by a doctor for Mr. Trump, which proclaimed the candidate\u2019s strength and stamina to be \u201cextraordinary\u201d and declared that he would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. \u201d The doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, told NBC News last week that he had written the letter in five minutes while a black car waited outside his office to collect it. As for his choice of words about Mr. Trump, Dr. Bornstein said he \u201cpicked up his kind of language and then just interpreted it to my own. \u201d Mr. Trump \u201cwon\u2019t even release credible information about his health,\u201d Mr. Kaine said at a waterfront rally, where the picturesque backdrop included a   boat with the initials V. P. (for Victorian Princess, not vice president). Mr. Kaine, 58, accused Mr. Trump, 70, of withholding critical information from the public on a variety of fronts, including his tax returns and details about his business ties. \u201cHillary Clinton has met every test of disclosure we expect of presidential candidates  \u2014   in many cases, has gone even further,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cDonald Trump has failed all of these tests miserably. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health has been the subject of conspiracy theories. Mr. Trump himself has raised questions about her fitness to serve as president, saying that Mrs. Clinton, 68, \u201clacks the mental and physical stamina\u201d needed for the job. On that subject, Mr. Kaine offered a firsthand defense of Mrs. Clinton. Though he mostly campaigns separately from Mrs. Clinton, he testified to her energy on the campaign trail and told the crowd that she had been \u201crunning on full speed\u201d for nearly a year and a half. \u201cCan I give you an     on this?\u201d he asked. \u201cI have been on the trail with Hillary for five weeks, and I can barely keep up with her. \u201d Mr. Kaine, a lawyer by training, then offered his own medical appraisal. \u201cI can tell you, Hillary Clinton is one tough and one healthy person,\u201d he said. \u201cVery, very tough and very, very healthy. \u201d And Mr. Kaine could not resist addressing Dr. Bornstein\u2019s contention that Mr. Trump would be the healthiest president, especially given the White House\u2019s    current occupant. \u201cI\u2019d like to see him go one on one with President Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s for another day. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561900.1910658}
