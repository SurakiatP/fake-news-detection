Peters said, \u201cOn the Gorsuch nomination, Joe, there\u2019s a lot of frustration privately among Democratic Senators, who will tell you, it\u2019s incredibly shortsighted of the Democrats to block this  \u2014   or to try to block this, they can\u2019t block it, of course, and lose their ability to filibuster whoever Trump nominates for the next open court seat. Because you don\u2019t know what the political dynamics are going to look like. You don\u2019t know how weak or strong Trump might be then. And if you take away the filibuster, and waste it on this fight, you basically give Trump carte blanche to nominate whomever he wants to the Supreme Court the next time around, and that one\u2019s going to be possibly for the Kennedy seat, and that one determines the makeup of the court. So, it seems like a wasted bullet I think, at least this is what I\u2019m hearing from some Democrats about it in the Senate. \u201d (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742628424.189038}
