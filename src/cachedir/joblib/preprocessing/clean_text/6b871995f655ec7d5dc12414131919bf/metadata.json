Proving just that was a few morons who decided to run over a Donald Trump lawn sign that they saw on the side of the road \u2013 and that\u2019s when they got slapped with the perfect dose of justice. \\nThe incident was posted to the Twitter account of a black Trump supporter named Tallah who lives in Detroit, Michigan. Now, if ever there was a place that should be sick of Democrats, it should be Detroit, but apparently, there are still people living in the city who enjoy living life as a slave to the government. Tallah (right) (Photo Source: Twitter ) \\nProving just that, it seems that a few of Tallah\u2019s Trump lawn signs triggered a liberal who just had to do something about it. Captured by pictures after the fact, the idiot decided the best way to voice his negative opinion on Trump was to destroy the woman\u2019s property. \\nAs can be seen, the idiot decided to swerve off the road and run over 4 signs that were sitting in Tallah\u2019s front lawn. Unfortunately for him, he was about to get a nasty dose of instance justice \u2013 and it\u2019s just delectable.

She put out a little surprise for anyone who would try what this triggered lefty did. Also captured in the photos was the woman\u2019s homemade booby trap \u2013 a board with nails sticking up just below the signs.

Too bad for them, Tallah even managed to get a picture of the idiot responsible as he tried to put the spare tire on his car. Triggered liberals licking their wounds (Photo Source: Twitter ) \\nHowever, it seems that the popped tire wasn\u2019t even the best part of the picture. After zooming in on the morons\u2019 faces, their expression shows that they received every bit of justice that they deserved. Even better yet, the signs weren\u2019t even really destroyed. It looks like all Tallah would need to do is bend them back up to standing position.

However, if liberals want to play dirty at every corner, we can whip out a few tricks of our own. With that being said, let\u2019s just hope this triggered fool learned a lesson. After all, I\u2019m sure his decision to destroy a $20 sign wasn\u2019t worth the price to get a new tire.'"}, "time": 1742562096.914332}
