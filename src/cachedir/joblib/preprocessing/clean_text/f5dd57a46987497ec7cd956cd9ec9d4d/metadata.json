Partial transcript as follows, starting at the 18:16 mark: They believe in the experiment. If you really understand the far left, the Marxists, it\u2019s like they want to take the jungle and turn it into a zoo. The world is a jungle. They want to turn it into a zoo. In a zoo, everybody gets along, everybody stays in their little safe spaces, cages, no one gets killed, there is no real competition, everybody gets fed the same stuff, and so, I think the people at ESPN think, \u201cWe can perfect this jungle if we just make it a zoo. No one will get killed. The lions and the giraffes, they\u2019ll look at each other from across their cages and they\u2019ll get along  \u2026    \u201d But at the end of the day, I think there are people that rightfully believe, \u201cGod created a jungle and we can be nice and play along, but there is going to be some competition here. And if you\u2019re weak, you\u2019re going to get left behind. And if you\u2019re not careful, a lion\u2019s going to come over here and ravage you. That is what the world is. \u201d Again, do we need some parameters within the jungle to make things fair? Absolutely, but turn it into a zoo? No dice.
