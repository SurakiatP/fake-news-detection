Mr. Obama made his comments at an annual    news conference. His remarks were tinged with melancholy at the impending end of his presidency, with foreboding about the changes that could follow   Donald J. Trump into office next month and with uneasiness about the role Russia played in the political upheaval that has resulted from his election. The president spoke hours after Hillary Clinton, addressing campaign donors in New York, bluntly accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of orchestrating the hacks of her campaign and the Democratic National Committee computers \u201cto undermine our democracy,\u201d as part of a \u201cpersonal beef against me. \u201d Mr. Obama declined to place the blame so squarely on Mr. Putin, though he noted, \u201cNot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin. \u201d Mr. Obama also sought to diminish the specter of Russian influence over the American political process, saying Russia was a smaller, weaker country that \u201cdoesn\u2019t produce anything that anybody wants to buy, except oil and gas and arms. \u201d Still, the president was clearly wrestling with what he said the hacking affair and the reaction to it revealed about the state of American politics. Citing a recent poll that showed more than a third of Trump voters saying they approved of Mr. Putin  \u2014   \u201cRonald Reagan would roll over in his grave,\u201d Mr. Obama said  \u2014   the president appealed to Americans not to allow partisan hatred and feuds to blind them to manipulation by foreign powers. \u201cUnless that changes,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence because we\u2019ve lost track of what it is that we\u2019re about and what we stand for. \u201d Mr. Obama offered a long list of accomplishments that he said marked his eight years in office. But the messy aftermath of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory has raised questions about Mr. Obama\u2019s   response to the hacking, ignited a nasty squabble between Mr. Trump and the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies, and left a residue of suspicion over the vote itself. The president continued to defend his cautious approach to reports of hacking  \u2014   an approach that has come under criticism from Democrats after it emerged last week that the intelligence agencies had concluded Russia was trying to help Mr. Trump win the election. \u201cWe were playing this thing straight  \u2014   we weren\u2019t trying to advantage one side or the other,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cImagine if we had done the opposite. It would have become one more political scrum. \u201d The president, however, is likely to face further questions after his C. I. A. director, John O. Brennan, issued a statement Friday disputing reports of a rift between the intelligence agencies and the C. I. A. over Russia\u2019s motives in hacking the D. N. C. and handing over emails to WikiLeaks, which released them in the weeks leading up to the vote. In his statement, first reported by The Washington Post, Mr. Brennan said he had met with the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey, and the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, and \u201cthere is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election. \u201d That statement will also challenge Mr. Trump, who has seized on reports of an interagency squabble to undermine the credibility of the hacking findings. He has criticized the C. I. A. analysis, saying it was supplied by the same agency that provided erroneous intelligence about Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction before the Iraq War. Mr. Obama held out hope that when Mr. Trump takes office, he would take a more sober approach. He said he had had \u201ccordial\u201d conversations with his successor, and that Mr. Trump had listened to his suggestions about \u201cmaintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of our office, our various democratic institutions,\u201d though he was not specific. The president defended the F. B. I. which has come under fierce criticism from Mrs. Clinton and her aides because of Mr. Comey\u2019s   announcement that the bureau was considering reopening its investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email, which she has said cost her the election. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks on Thursday underscored longstanding differences she has had with her former boss in how the United States should view Mr. Putin. For his part, Mr. Obama also made a startling admission as he described how his administration had reacted to the Russian hack: He said it was not until the \u201cbeginning of the summer\u201d that the White House was \u201calerted to the possibility that the D. N. C. has been hacked. \u201d That was nine months after an F. B. I. agent had first contacted the Democratic National Committee with evidence that a major,   hacking group was inside the committee\u2019s networks, raising the question of why it took so long for that news to reach the president. Mr. Obama made it clear that he went out of his way to play down the news, because \u201cin this hyperpartisan atmosphere\u201d he did not think he or anyone else at the White House could talk about it without risking to appear to be acting on behalf of Mrs. Clinton. But the unintended result, as some of Obama aides concede, was that the Russians faced very little resistance. Not until September, when Mr. Obama pulled Mr. Putin aside at a Group of 20 meeting in Hanghzhou, China, was the Russian leader given a warning directly from the United States. Mr. Obama said he told him \u201cto cut it out, there were going to be serious consequences if he did not. \u201d The president made it sound like that worked, saying \u201cwe did not see further tampering of the election process. \u201d But the leaks of D. N. C. emails, and those of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign manager, continued, because they were already in the hands of WikiLeaks, which doled them out to an eager news media until the last days of the campaign. The Russian government\u2019s motives were hardly a mystery, Mr. Obama said, \u201cbecause you guys wrote about it every day, every single leak about every little juicy piece of political gossip, including John Podesta\u2019s risotto recipe. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562477.398597}
