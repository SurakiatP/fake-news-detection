How do we get dumb young people to support Hillary? We get morons like @MileyCyrus & @katyperry to knock on doors! https://t.co/RbJl04WZuG pic.twitter.com/ude7XFherP \\n\u2014 Derek Hunter (@derekahunter) October 28, 2016 \\nEnter Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus and a horde of other \u201cpop culture\u201d icons who appeal to the young and dumb. @derekahunter @benshapiro Combine that with BJs from Madonna and the youth outreach is complete! How did we lose to this? #rhetorical \\nOh yeah! Totally forgot about Madonna\u2019s promise \u2026 oddly enough Hillary didn\u2019t really climb all that much in the polls after that. @derekahunter @MileyCyrus @katyperry For a good laugh give both of them a civics test. \ud83d\ude02 \\n\u2014 Dale Mitchell (@thurzday60) October 28, 2016 \\nTHAT would be hilarious.'"}, "time": 1742563092.4039545}
