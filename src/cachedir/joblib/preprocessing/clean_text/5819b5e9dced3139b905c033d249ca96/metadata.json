A.  winning streak on Saturday was a sense of drama and amazement.   victories in a row with no end to the winning in sight? \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t sit here and figure out how many games we\u2019re going to win in a row,\u201d Coach Geno Auriemma said before the Huskies broke out to a   lead and obliterated Southern Methodist in Dallas,   to write the latest chapter in the program\u2019s illustrious history. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it before. \u201d From 2008 to 2010, his team, powered by Maya Moore, chased and overtook the   streak set by the U. C. L. A. men\u2019s team in 1974, peaking at 90 straight before losing to Stanford. Given Connecticut\u2019s dominance of the college women\u2019s game  \u2014   the Huskies have won the last four national titles and a record 11 in all under Auriemma  \u2014   the notion of another lengthy streak was never a question. But when Connecticut finished an unbeaten season last April by routing Syracuse in the national title game for its 75th straight victory, the widespread belief in women\u2019s basketball circles was that the latest streak would quickly end, and that the next edition of the team could lose multiple games. In the 2016 W. N. B. A. draft, the graduating portion of the UConn roster provided the top three picks, including Breanna Stewart, who was named the most outstanding player all four years she played in the Final Four. Going into this season, the Huskies for once lacked a preseason   and they had an undersized front line, a shallow bench and uncertainty at the   point guard position. But they did begin with a belief in the system generated by so much success and by Auriemma, who seldom lacks in  . \u201cEverybody in the whole country has talked about what we\u2019ve lost,\u201d said Kia Nurse, a junior and   national champion. \u201cI personally like playing with a chip on our shoulder. \u201d That chip has turned into a steamrollering boulder. The streak nearly ended on opening night, at Florida State, when the Seminoles had a   shot in the air for the win. The shot fell short, and nobody has pushed the Huskies that hard since. It wasn\u2019t as if they took the path of least resistance to victory No. 91. Auriemma had joked that everyone was eager to schedule Connecticut this season, when seven of its first 12 games were against Top 25 teams, including road games against No. 2 Notre Dame and No. 4 Maryland, and a home game against No. 3 Baylor. Only the Baylor game was close in the final minutes. Along the way, the Huskies have developed a new Big Three, in the sophomores Katie Lou Samuelson and Napheesa Collier and the junior Gabby Williams. They have never lost a game in the American Athletic Conference their next formidable challenge figures to be a nonconference game at home on Feb. 13 against South Carolina, which is ranked No. 5 in the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches polls. \u201cWomen\u2019s basketball is always a little bit under the radar,\u201d Auriemma said after the new record was secured. \u201cBut people that follow the game appreciate what this program has done. \u201d If the streak lasts until the South Carolina game, the Huskies will be shooting for a   No. 100. \u201cSome things you just can\u2019t really explain,\u201d Auriemma said. \u201cYou just have to enjoy it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563069.0422096}
