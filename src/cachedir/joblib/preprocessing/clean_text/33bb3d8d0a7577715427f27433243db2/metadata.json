However, as soon as Trump heard about what the leftist thugs had done, he immediately issued a special announcement that has us cheering. \\nAfter privileged millionaire James Otis obliterated the Donald\u2019s sidewalk star on Wednesday, an unnamed homeless woman boldly took it upon herself to act as guardian, making the cold slab her new temporary home. Utilizing her sleeping spot as her own political platform, the courageous vagrant created signs to peacefully showcase her support for Trump. Unfortunately, she underestimated just how savage and intolerant liberals are, especially when it comes to the minorities they claim to champion expressing a different opinion. \\nJust one day after the homeless woman set up residence next to Trump\u2019s star, a mob of vicious anti-Trump thugs attacked her, RT reports. After pushing her around and stealing her signs, some of the only property she owns, the animals knocked her and her cart down, continuing to hurl sickening insults and snatch things. \\nVideo captured the enraging assault, showing the woman lying on the ground, shaking, and holding back tears. Fortunately, the heart-breaking story quickly made its way to Trump, the only politician concerned with this transient\u2019s well-being. Now, the Republican nominee has made an incredible announcement befitting of a U.S. president. \\nThe Gateway Pundit reports that Trump was so appalled by the mob\u2019s treatment of this destitute woman that he has not only announced that he has a special \u201cgift\u201d for the victim but promises to seek justice for her barbaric abusers. The presidential candidate\u2019s attorney, Michael Cohen, proclaimed on Friday that Trump promises the woman will have \u201cthe last laugh on these thugs.\u201d . @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump someone please help me locate this woman as Mr. Trump has a gift for her\u2026 \\n\u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) October 28, 2016 \\nAt Trump\u2019s behest, Cohen exploded on Twitter, repeatedly requesting followers to find the homeless woman. He explained that they have checked, but she is no longer staying on Trump\u2019s star. However, the candidate wants to \u201cchange her life\u201d when he finds her. \\nProving just how passionate Trump is about helping the woman, Cohen spent much of Friday responding to tweets, hoping to find some clue as to the woman\u2019s current whereabouts. One user asserted that the woman is Marsha Lee , a resident of Santa Monica. However, it is unclear if this information is accurate. \\nCohen assured that the police are investigating the incident and he and Trump will do everything possible to see that the thugs responsible for the assault are brought to justice. It\u2019s truly heart-warming to see such a powerful man going out of his way to do something significant for someone considered \u201cthe least of these.\u201d \\nHopefully, this woman will receive the mystery gift Trump has waiting for her and the savages who bullied an innocent homeless person will be punished for their cowardly behavior. Of course, don\u2019t expect Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama to say that her black life matters or even apologize for the thuggery of their own supporters. In fact, neither of them has come forward to help the unfortunate victim of their national policies that never helped her off the streets in the first place. \\nThis stomach-churning incident just goes to show how tolerant the left is when it comes to blacks, or anyone else for that matter, simply having an opinion with which they disagree.'"}, "time": 1742563165.86198}
