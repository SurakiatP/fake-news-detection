Jack Bergman\u2019s ( ) Thursday evening town hall in Gaylord, Michigan, shouting, \u201cSeparation of church and state!\u201d as other constituents stood with their heads bowed in respect. [Dr. Derek Hagland, the assistant pastor at Grace Baptist Church in Michigan\u2019s First District, had just taken the stage to recite an invocation when activists began chanting, \u201cSeparation of church and state!\u201d to disrupt him:   \u201cThis guy was giving invocation,\u201d Rep. Bergman\u2019s communication director Farahn Morgan told Breitbart News. \u201cHe was not necessarily party affiliated in any way. That kind of reaction to him? It was the most aggressive that the crowd got during the entire event which was, quite honestly, shocking. \u201d She added that it was surprising that these activists refused \u201cto engage in dialogue after months of demanding there be a dialogue. The display was upsetting for the constituents who attended and really wanted to participate in a dialogue and hear what the congressman thinks and share their thoughts with him in a constructive way. The activists\u2019 behavior flew in the face of any constructive dialogue. \u201d She described the incident as \u201ca coordinated fiasco. \u201d Video footage of the event, provided to Breitbart News by an attendee, showed some Republicans and community leaders standing with their heads bowed during the prayer, despite the disruptive chants. Some of the activists wore pink pussy hats, the same ones donned as a symbol of \u201cresistance\u201d during   Donald Trump protests across the nation following his inauguration:  Morgan also noted that the interruption did not sit well with some of Rep. Bergman\u2019s Democrat constituents. \u201cA lot of Democrats approached us tonight and said they were embarrassed and apologized. They said those activists did not represent them or what they are about. I thought that was an interesting dynamic. \u201d Bergman, a retired   general who served in the Marine Corps, also held a town hall on Wednesday evening:  \u201cLast night, the crowd was certainly more orderly,\u201d Morgan said. She added that there was also a prayer recited Wednesday evening, \u201cbut local media live streamed last night\u2019s event and many local groups watched it and planned how to react to tonight\u2019s town hall. \u201d She said the group Indivisible was most likely one of the main groups involved in the disruption. Morgan said Congressman Bergman felt \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the display. Several hours earlier, he had tweeted his enthusiasm about holding constructive dialogue: Gaylord town hall is just starting! Looking forward to some constructive dialogue. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Rep. Jack Bergman (@RepJackBergman) April 20, 2017,  \u201cAs a Christian, his faith definitely factors into his decision making. He also says the Constitution is ultimately the sort of guide and document that elected members of Congress have to abide by,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly transparent about faith being an important part of his life. His faith is unequivocally what guides him, and he\u2019s not apologetic about that at all. \u201d Recently, Rep. Bergman said, \u201cWe learned from England that mandated religion was not a good idea, and so we don\u2019t mandate religion. \u201d Bergman, who serves on the Budget Committee, the Natural Resources Committee, and the Veterans Affairs Committee, was reportedly one of 54 freshmen congressmen to sign a letter agreeing to argue political issues without attacking those with whom he disagrees. According to the Traverse City Record Eagle, \u201cHe called the letter the hallmark of the House\u2019s freshman class, plans on bringing that kind of civil discourse to his town halls and expects attendees to \u2018treat adults like adults. \u2019\u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742564305.125029}
