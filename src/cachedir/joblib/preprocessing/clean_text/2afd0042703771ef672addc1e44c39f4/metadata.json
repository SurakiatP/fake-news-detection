The residents of Gatlinburg sat idling in their cars and trucks in the chill of a mountain morning, waiting to return to the little tourist city they had been forced to evacuate Monday night. For most of them, it would be the first time back since the fire in the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park roared through, whipped into a rage by an uncommonly strong wind. Now, four days later, government crews were still up on the winding streets looking for survivors and bodies. The authorities said that nearly 1, 000 buildings had been damaged or destroyed in Sevier County, which includes Gatlinburg, a city of about 4, 000. Thirteen people were confirmed dead. Nellie Gauvreau, 47, was behind the wheel of an old Dodge van, smoking. She had already heard that her home had burned down, but she wanted to see it for herself. Her friend Sherry Angel, 44, was in the passenger seat. Ms. Angel had heard that her aunt had died in the blaze, though other family members said Friday that the woman was only missing. The line of cars crept toward town. \u201cWhat happens now,\u201d Ms. Gauvreau said, \u201cis that we just pick up our pieces and move on. \u201d There were moments this week in Gatlinburg when crying seemed like the only reasonable response. The police chief choked back tears at a news conference. Katrina Bogle, 41, a worker at a Subway restaurant near the perimeter of the evacuation zone, cried Friday while assembling a sandwich. \u201cThis is incredible, what Jesus is doing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. It was particularly painful that the fire, a disaster of a magnitude modern Gatlinburg has never seen, would come at the onset of the Christmas season. This dramatically beautiful pocket of Appalachian East Tennessee is a place of tiny country churches and a big, homegrown  \u2014   and homespun  \u2014   entertainment business, and Christmas is a crucial time for both. Dolly Parton\u2019s Dollywood theme park is a few miles away in Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg\u2019s gaudier sister city. Southern families flock to the area just before Christmas to shop at outlet malls and fill up the holiday attractions. In Gatlinburg, it is the   charm of the Fantasy of Lights parade. In Pigeon Forge, it is the live Nativity show at the   Dixie Stampede dinner theater and the special seasonal \u201cChristmas Disaster\u201d version of the comic Hatfield  McCoy Dinner Show. By Friday, the dawning scope of the economic damage had begun to mingle with the more pressing grief and shock. Rumors of the victims\u2019 identities trickled through the emergency shelters the authorities had only publicly named five of them as of Friday afternoon. Survivors traded their stories of narrow escape through the smoke and racing flames Monday night. But many had also begun to wonder what they would do next. \u201cIf the tourists don\u2019t come back, there\u2019s no work,\u201d Silvestre Trinidad, 25, a restaurant employee, said in Spanish as he waited around with a large group of men who shared similar stories at the Rocky Top Sports World, a big athletic complex that turned into the main shelter. The return procession to Gatlinburg Friday was only temporary: Residents, and even tourists, who had been forced to leave town at a moment\u2019s notice, were given little time to assess, grab essentials and leave. The mayor of Sevier County, Larry Waters, said that the city would not be open to the public until Wednesday at the latest. A number of the burned buildings were vacation rentals. But a bigger worry was the international news of the disaster, and the fact that it was difficult to discern, from a distance, what had not been ruined. Mark Adams, the chief executive and president of the Gatlinburg Chamber of Commerce, posted a video on Facebook showing off the relatively unmolested main commercial strip. \u201cEverything is here,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the shops that you\u2019re accustomed to seeing here. \u201d But some were hesitant to visit what they thought might be a disaster zone. The problem was even afflicting Pigeon Forge, which was largely unscathed. Kelly Johnson and her family operate a number of restaurants in the area. One of them, a Gatlinburg steak house, burned down. But she said that big parties  \u2014   family reunions and rehearsal dinners  \u2014   had been canceling at her Pigeon Forge business. \u201cIt did not burn the city to the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if people think that happened, we are in big, big trouble. \u201d David Fee, president of the company that owns the   Hatfield  McCoy Dinner Show, said the fire had cost the company at least $300, 000 in the past three days. That included some 2, 000 donated meals and lost ticket revenues, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to lay anybody off as long as we\u2019re able,\u201d he said. But, \u201ca quarter of a million dollars in three days is nothing you can sustain for long. \u201d Ms. Parton announced Thursday that she would donate $1, 000 a month for up to six months to county residents who had lost their homes. A native of Sevier County, Ms. Parton has become one of the area\u2019s most prominent benefactors, and the gesture burnished a reputation that needs no burnishing. At the shelter, Nancy Garner, 54, said Ms. Parton used to regularly to give her cash decades ago, when Ms. Garner was working as a housekeeper for minimum wage and trying to raise her children. Ms. Parton, she said, is distant kin. \u201cShe\u2019s got a big heart, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d she said. Those close family and community ties remain in Sevier County, even as Dollywood has given the place a corporate makeover, and people were relying on them heavily this week. Ms. Gauvreau, a rental property manager, drove into town past   buildings next to perfectly fine ones: the fire, it seemed, had hopscotched around erratically. She teared up at the sight of her house. She looked for a cat but had no luck. Then she screwed up some courage and drove on through the   ghost town to survey the properties she is charged with overseeing. \u201cMy heart is not hurting because of me,\u201d she had said earlier. \u201cI\u2019m hurting for the tenants of mine that I saw every day. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561731.81576}
