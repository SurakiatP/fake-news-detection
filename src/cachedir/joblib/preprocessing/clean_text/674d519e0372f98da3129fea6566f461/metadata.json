Not that you would have known it by the behavior of the music industry\u2019s mainstream gatekeepers. While \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d which Mr. Glover, the star and creator of \u201cAtlanta\u201d on FX, unexpectedly called \u201cthe best song   \u2026     ever\u201d onstage, had been building in clubs and online since its August release, it had only recently reached radio and was far from the   of other more anodyne (and, notably, whiter) streaming smashes. For weeks, as the song turned into a sensation through a torrent of internet memes and listens on YouTube and Spotify (with now more than 250 million combined streams) representatives for Migos had been trying to book the roguish group  \u2014   made up of the rappers Quavo, Offset and Takeoff  \u2014   a performance on   television, a rite of passage for rising acts. They were repeatedly brushed off. \u201cThey gave all kinds of excuses  \u2014   not the right time, it\u2019s not this, it\u2019s not that,\u201d recalled Pierre Thomas, better known as Pee, the chief executive of Quality Control Music, Migos\u2019s label. \u201cBut as soon as Donald Glover did that, the next day, all the people who had just denied us wanted them on their show. \u201d The very next week, Migos took \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d to \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d Battling fickle tastes has been a constant for Migos since the trio stormed the   firmament in 2013, bringing a Gucci bag full of flashy new tricks, including their trademark stuttering,   triplet flow and an endless series of sticky catchphrases,   and vocal tics (\u201cGrrr,\u201d \u201cThat way! \u201d). But those who start trends don\u2019t always reap the rewards. \u201cVersace,\u201d the group\u2019s breakout song, was lifted, but then eclipsed, by Drake\u2019s faithful remix, while \u201cdabbing,\u201d once Migos lingo, morphed into a   dance craze. As repeated arrests sidelined Migos\u2019s members at crucial moments, like the   to their debut album, \u201cYung Rich Nation\u201d  \u2014   a commercial flop in 2015, selling just 15, 000 copies its first week  \u2014   the group risked becoming another casualty of rap\u2019s      culture, where younger viral artists are always bubbling, especially in Atlanta. With a refined strategy for harnessing the rise of streaming, where young listeners flock to rap, Migos is now zooming at an even higher level. With the release of its second album, \u201cCulture,\u201d out digitally on Friday, the trio focused its exuberant songwriting. It is choosing more airy, ornate trap beats and taming its staccato verbal onslaught to make better use of empty space, while tending to both its online and      boosters. In New York this week, Takeoff, 22, the group\u2019s most reserved member, compared the album   to Christmas Eve, his sleepy eyes lighting up. \u201cYou just know that everything you asked for is going to be there up under that Christmas tree,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our time now. \u201d Migos\u2019s de facto leader, Quavo, 25, is its most alluring presence and a melodic songwriter. He was defiant about the group\u2019s sometimes samey or excessive output, which has included more than a dozen free online mixtapes since 2011. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the same thing we\u2019ve been doing, making the same music,\u201d he said \u201cI feel like the world just caught up. \u201d The group\u2019s business team is more realistic  \u2014   and, by necessity, more strategic. \u201cTruth be told, we did have a minor setback for a major comeback,\u201d Kevin Lee, the Quality Control executive known as Coach K, said. After a rocky 2015, which, amid legal issues, still included the release of five   Migos projects with middling effect, 2016 was about slowing down and spreading out. Though Migos released just one official mixtape last year, its members appeared as guests on an unfathomable number of tracks by other artists, pop and street, expanding their sonic palette and fans\u2019 understanding of their individual attributes. \u201cI applaud them in stretching their tentacles and bringing it back to the nucleus,\u201d said Kevin Liles, the veteran   executive whose label, 300 Entertainment, distributes Migos\u2019s music in partnership with Quality Control. \u201cThat only made the nucleus stronger. \u201d Coach K said that Quavo\u2019s blistering solo run, especially  \u2014   honored in the hourlong D. J. mix \u201cFeaturing Quavo\u201d  \u2014   motivated Offset and Takeoff, adding, \u201cOnce it all came back together, it was an explosion. \u201d It\u2019s fitting, then, that the group\u2019s crowning achievement thus far was started by Offset  \u2014   who spent two monthslong stints in jail on weapons charges and probation violations during Migos\u2019s rise  \u2014   one night while he was home alone. After creating the \u201c  top\u201d hook for \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d that would go on to fuel endless Twitter chatter,  he sent it to the team for completion, certain it could be a hit. The Platonic ideal of a Migos song, the track mixes sensational    talk with an overriding sense of personal uplift. \u201cSome opportunities were probably lost because of my situation, but I was fortunate to have brothers that could keep the train moving,\u201d Offset, 25, said. \u201cThis song is like a rebirth. \u201d Migos\u2019s labels put \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d in the best position to succeed with a few deliberate distribution tweaks, giving it its premiere only on SoundCloud  \u2014   \u201cwhere the kids live,\u201d Coach K said  \u2014   to build buzz, and timing its wider release to Labor Day weekend, when rap radio relies on D. J. mix shows instead of more fixed playlists, leaving the door open for emerging sounds. (The next single, \u201c\u201d was released with similar precision, first with a majestic, arctic video, and then the official audio ahead of Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday.) Quality Control also sent Migos back to basics  \u2014   working the Atlanta strip club scene  \u2014   to build momentum and \u201cget the vibe of the people,\u201d Pee said. \u201cWhen you see girls on that stage singing the words, you know you got a hit on your hands. \u201d Migos\u2019s zealous army of online supporters (see the earlier \u201cbetter than the Beatles\u201d meme) also did its part, disseminating everything from an impromptu jingle for potato chips to a clip of the group performing \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d live in Nigeria. Crucially, there has never been a dearth of Migos content to spread, even during seemingly fallow periods, thanks to the group\u2019s commitment to creating constantly. In Manhattan on Tuesday, the trio had about three hours of downtime in between promotional obligations, but as the members pulled up to their Times Square hotel, they noted that the famed   recording space Quad Studios was just across the street. There was little discussion before a decision was reached. (When the group\u2019s handlers called me to find out where the rappers were, a member of Migos\u2019s inner circle grabbed the phone to hang up.) \u201cWake up,\u201d Quavo said. \u201cTime to work. \u201d Once inside, after some finagling, the group rolled weed and ate pepperoni pizzas as its recording engineer, who travels with the trio, set up. Alone in front of the microwave, Takeoff counted comically large stacks of money as Quavo changed into a fuzzy pair of \u201clucky studio socks. \u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of going to sit at the hotel?\u201d he said before entering the vocal booth. Four hours later, a   new song was done, but then Migos was late to a listening party for its own album. The rappers had been too busy making more music, refusing to leave the studio until all three had finished their verses.'"}, "time": 1742628603.6969655}
