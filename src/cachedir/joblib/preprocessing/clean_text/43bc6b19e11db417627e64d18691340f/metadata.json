Perhaps nothing will. But Saturday provided a dramatic recovery, a tense rekindling of joy where before there was national shame. Maracan\u00e3 Stadium filled with celebration and relief as Brazil won its first Olympic soccer title, defeating Germany,   on penalty kicks after the match remained tied at   through 120 minutes. The victory provided some redemption from, if not erasure of, a humiliating   defeat to Die Mannschaft at home in the semifinals of the World Cup. When the Brazilian goalkeeper Weverton dived to his left to save a penalty kick by Germany\u2019s Nils Petersen, the anxiety of the evening exploded into liberation. Neymar, the star forward, then approached the ball for the winning penalty kick. He did a stutter step then shot high and assuredly. Brazil has won five World Cups but never until that moment of release an Olympic gold medal. Neymar went to his knees, then onto his stomach, his hands covering his face, struggling to control his emotions. His teammates, who had been on their knees at midfield, as if praying, began running toward him in a jubilant sprint. \u201cChampions!\u201d roared the crowd of about 78, 000 at Maracan\u00e3. A Brazilian fan ran from the stands into the group hug of players. He wore a national flag like a cape, as if superhero effort had been needed to reverse the traumatic outcome against Germany two years ago. \u201cNothing will replace 7 to 1,\u201d said Roberto Artiaga, 39, a Brazilian fan. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. But it eases the pain. We will hurt a little less. \u201d Saturday\u2019s victory came with far different rosters and under far different circumstances from the 2014 World Cup. The Olympic tournament is for players under 23 years of age, with three older players allowed per team. It is a youth tournament, so that FIFA, soccer\u2019s governing body, can protect the singularity of the World Cup, which it considers the most important international sporting event. Neymar, 24, sat out that shocking loss to Germany in 2014 with a broken vertebra in his back. Matthias Ginter, a central defender who made one of Germany\u2019s penalty kicks Saturday, was the youngest player on Germany\u2019s World Cup roster but did not leave the bench. \u201cNobody here played in that final,\u201d Weverton, the Brazilian goalkeeper told reporters before Saturday\u2019s match. \u201cWhat happened in the past is in the past. Nothing is going to change that, even if we win by seven goals. We have a chance to create our own history. \u201d The Olympics might be a lesser tournament, but Saturday\u2019s   match possessed the same stressed, edgy feel of a World Cup final. \u201cWe are very excited, very scared and afraid, too,\u201d Mariana Canuto, 33, a Brazilian fan, said beforehand. In the 27th minute, Neymar curled a free kick off the underside of the crossbar and into the upper left corner, giving Brazil a   lead. But this exorcism would not come easily. In the 59th minute, Max Meyer swiveled on a crossing pass and tied the score at   with a low, hard shot. Still, Brazil kept its resolve at Maracan\u00e3, a storied arena, but also the site of one of Brazil\u2019s most heartbreaking defeats, a   loss to Uruguay in the decisive game of the 1950 World Cup before a crowd reported to be 199, 854. The stadium has been downsized, along with certainty about Brazil\u2019s superiority as a soccer nation. That World Cup loss to Germany seemed to rob Brazil of its assurance that individual skill and flair could trump collective organization by an opponent. Then, in June, Brazil bombed out of Copa America in group play and Dunga was fired as national coach. Many have begun to compare Brazilian soccer to the country\u2019s ongoing political and economic crises, with corruption and stagnant management in the national soccer federation and a development program that exports young players overseas. Meanwhile, the longing and heartache in Brazil have been refracted through a lens of German success. Germany won the 2014 World Cup at Maracan\u00e3, defeating Lionel Messi and Argentina by   in the final. The German women\u2019s team won an Olympic gold medal there this week and the German men were seeking gold of their own Saturday. Mauro Beting, a commentator and reporter for Fox Sports Brasil, said before the tournament that Brazil\u2019s players would start tentatively, knowing that \u201cin every beginning of a game, every time they make a mistake, they will think, \u2018It\u2019s   coming. \u2019\u201d Even if Brazil won a gold medal, Beting projected, \u201cAt the same time that the team will be running the victory lap, thinking, \u2018We finally won the Olympics,\u2019 fans in Maracan\u00e3 will say, \u2018You\u2019ve lost  .\u2019 Neymar, you can be the star of the Olymics, but in the World Cup you were not there. \u2019\u201d Brazilian fans are like that, he said. \u201cSoccer fans are cruel and were most cruel on the defeat to Germany,\u201d Beting said. Before the tournament, the news media criticized Neymar, Brazil\u2019s captain, for partying too much while on vacation during Copa America. And after Brazil failed to score a goal during its first two Olympic matches, some fans mocked him with \u201cmissing\u201d posters. Others screamed \u201cMarta!\u201d as if they preferred the star of the Brazilian women\u2019s team. But fans can be as forgiving as they are cruel. Neymar scored a goal and a penalty kick on Saturday, and kept Brazil from losing its confidence. The crowd chanted his name in appreciation, and he became the first Brazilian captain to wear an Olympic gold medal around his neck. \u201cBrazil is five times champion of the World Cup and we had never had a gold medal before, so against any team it would have been great,\u201d said Manoel Santos, 56, a Brazilian fan. \u201cBut, O. K. being against Germany made it that much sweeter. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563619.0086174}
