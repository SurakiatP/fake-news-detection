That means \u201cbeing able to highlight the incredible beauty of a place like this, but also recognizing that if oceans continue to get warmer, that a lot of the marine species here could be affected, and ultimately that\u2019s going to have an impact on human populations,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama traveled to Midway, part of the uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, to recognize his expansion last week of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, the world\u2019s largest protected area and home to more than 7, 000 species of wildlife, some of them endangered and others found nowhere else. The area has millions of tropical sea birds, including rare albatrosses, and it teems with sea life such as endangered whales, sharks and dolphins, as well as   black coral, considered the   marine species. \u201cFor us to be able to protect and preserve this national monument, to extend it, and, most importantly, to interact with native Hawaiians and other stakeholders so that the way we protect and manage this facility is consistent with ancient traditions and the best science available, this is going to be a precious resource for generations to come,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters after touring the 2.   atoll in a golf cart motorcade and receiving a briefing from the Fish and Wildlife Service officials who manage it. Under a blazing hot sun, white terns cruised overhead and dotted the trees, their fuzzy chicks cooling themselves in puddles by the side of the rough path Mr. Obama passed over as he took in the lush landscape. \u201cSpectacular,\u201d the president said as he stood at Turtle Beach, as four endangered green sea turtles rested on white sand nearby, with nothing but cyan waters stretching behind him. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get in,\u201d added Mr. Obama, who snorkeled off the coast later in the day. The expansion of the marine reserve and Mr. Obama\u2019s trip to the island, named for its location about halfway between Asia and North America, were part of an effort by the president to showcase his commitment to combating climate change and protecting lands and waters that can serve as refuges as the planet increasingly experiences the effects of global warming. After Midway, the president was scheduled to fly to China to discuss climate change. Mr. Obama, nearing the end of his eight years in office, is reaching for lasting symbols of his achievements and seeking opportunities to check items off his   list while he still has the trappings and travel perquisites of the presidency. He is also looking toward life after the presidency, when he said he might have an easier time fostering consensus on the need to confront climate change and mobilizing the public around a bipartisan approach. \u201cMy hope is maybe as   I can have a little more influence on some of my Republican friends, who I think, up until now, have been resistant to the science,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the interview. \u201cThis is something that all of us are going to have to tackle, and maybe I get a little more of a hearing if I\u2019m not occupying a political office. \u201d Mr. Obama announced last week that he was vastly expanding the Papahanaumokuakea monument, created by President George W. Bush a decade ago, bringing its size to more than 580, 000 square miles  \u2014   three and a half times the size of California  \u2014   from a little less than 140, 000 square miles. Scientists and environmental groups have cheered the action. But commercial fishing interests have expressed strong opposition, arguing that Mr. Obama has harmed their industry by prohibiting   fishing in vast waters. \u201cWe do not believe the expansion is based on the best available scientific information,\u201d Kitty Simonds, executive director of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, said in a statement. \u201cIt serves a political legacy rather than any conservation benefits. \u201d Mr. Obama was concerned on Thursday with both. Midway and the surrounding islands and waters are regarded as a climate refuge, a place whose natural characteristics make it more resilient to climate change. \u201cThe president has made a very bold statement that the world needs to take more tangible, bold actions to make sure that we\u2019re protecting our ecosystems from climate change,\u201d said Matt Rand, director of the Ocean Legacy Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts. In visiting the island, Mr. Rand added, Mr. Obama was getting \u201ca view into what our oceans and our planet looked like 100 years ago, really before we had significant human degradation in the ecosystem,\u201d when bird life and top predatory fish were abundant and coral was healthy. Mr. Obama is not the first American president to visit the remote island. Richard M. Nixon stopped there in June 1969, at the height of bird breeding season, for five hours of meetings with President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam, during which the two agreed on plans for the United States to begin withdrawing troops. Mr. Obama visited during a season when most of Midway\u2019s birds have finished breeding and flown out to sea, leaving some of the island\u2019s most fervent protectors feeling that the president was missing out. \u201cCome back\u201d in June 2017, Teya M. Penniman implored Mr. Obama in a message posted on the website of Friends of Midway Atoll. \u201cEven though you won\u2019t be the current president, it will still give you a much better understanding of what you\u2019ve just done,\u201d Ms. Penniman wrote. \u201cThe birds, fish, corals, seals, algae, turtles, dolphins and whales thank you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562040.6225665}
