President-Elect Trump wants to make dramatic changes in his nation\u2019s course. His battle cry of wanting to make \u201cAmerica Great Again\u201d evokes \u2013 and almost certainly is intended to evoke \u2013 the epic American economic expansions of the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries. \\nTrump wants to reverse the off-shoring of American jobs; he wants to revive America\u2019s manufacturing base; he wants to recast the terms of international trade; he wants growth; and he wants jobs in the U.S. \u2013 and he wants to turn America\u2019s foreign policy around 180 degrees. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads \u201cVote Trump\u201d on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) \\nIt is an agenda that is, as it were, quite laudable. Many Americans want just this, and the transition in which we are presently in \u2013 dictated by the global elusiveness and search for growth (whatever is meant now by this term \u201cgrowth\u201d), clearly requires a different economic approach from that followed in recent decades. \\nAs Ra\u00fal Ilargi Meijer has perceptively posited , greater self-reliance \u201cis the future of the world, \u2018post-growth\u2019, and post-globalization. Every country, and every society, needs to focus on self-reliance, not as some idealistic luxury choice, but as a necessity. And that is not as bad or terrible as people would have you believe, and it\u2019s not the end of the world \u2026 It is not an idealistic transition towards self-sufficiency, it\u2019s simply and inevitably what\u2019s left, once unfettered growth hits the skids. \u2026 \\n\u201cOur entire world views and \u2018philosophies\u2019 are based on ever more and ever bigger and then some, and our entire economies are built upon it. That has already made us ignore the decline of our real markets for many years now . We focus on data about stock markets and the like, and ignore the demise of our respective heartlands, and flyover countries \u2026 \\n\u201cDonald Trump looks very much like the ideal fit for this transition \u2026 What matters [here] is that he promises to bring back jobs to America, and that\u2019s what the country needs \u2026 Not so they can then export their products, but to consume them at home, and sell them in the domestic market \u2026There\u2019s nothing wrong or negative with an American buying products made in America instead of in China. \\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing economically \u2013 let alone morally \u2013 wrong with people producing what they and their families and close neighbours themselves want, and need, without hauling it halfway around the world for a meagre profit. At least not for the man in the street. It\u2019s not a threat to our \u2018open societies\u2019, as many claim. That openness does not depend on having things shipped to your stores over 1000s of miles, that you could have made yourselves, at a potentially huge benefit to your local economy. An \u2018open society\u2019 is a state of mind, be it collective or personal. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s for sale.\u201d \\nA Great Wish \\nThat\u2019s Trump\u2019s ostensible great wish, (it seems). It is not an unworthy one, but things have changed: America is no longer what it was in the Nineteenth or Twentieth centuries, neither in terms of untapped natural resources, nor societally. And nor is the rest of the world the same either. \\nMr. Trump rather unfortunately may find that his chief task will not be the management of this Great Re-orientation, but more prosaically, fending off the headwinds which he will face as he hauls on the tiller of the economy. \\nIn short, there is a real prospect that his ambitious economic \u201cremake\u201d may well be prematurely punctured by financial crisis. \\nThese headwinds will not be of his making, and for the main part, they lie beyond human agency per se . They are structural, and they are multiple. They represent the accumulation of an earlier monetary doctrine which will fetter the President-elect into a small corner from which any chosen exit will carry adverse implications. \\nDitto for anyone else trying to steer any ship of state in this contemporary global economy. Paradoxically \u2013 in an era moving toward greater self-sufficiency \u2013 what success Trump may have, however, will likely depend not on self-reliance so much as he would like. \\nFor his foreign policy about turn, he will depend on finding common interest with Russian President Vladimir Putin (that should not be too hard) \u2013 and for the economic \u201cabout turn\u201d \u2013 on Trump\u2019s ability not to confront China, but to come to some modus vivendi with President Xi (less easy). \\n\u201cThings are not what they were.\u201d Complexity \u201ctheory\u201d tells us that trying to repeat what worked earlier \u2013 in very different conditions \u2013 will likely not work if repeated later. In the Clinton era, for example, 85 percent of the U.S. population growth derived from the working-age population. The headwind that Trump will face is that, over the next eight years, 80 percent of the population growth will comprise 65+ year olds . And 65+ year olds are not a good engine of economic growth. This is not an uniquely American problem; it is a global trend too. \\n\u201cThe peak growth\u201d (according to Econimica blog), \u201cin the annual combined working age population (15-64 year/olds) among all the 35 wealthy OECD nations, China, Brazil, and Russia has collapsed since its 1981 peak. The annual growth in the working age population among these nations has fallen from +29 million a year to just +1 million in 2016 \u2026 but from here on, the working age population will be declining every year \u2026 These nations make up almost three quarters of all global demand for oil and exports in general. But their combined working age populations will shrink every year, from here on (surely for decades and perhaps far longer). Global demand for nearly everything is set to suffer. \u201d (FFR stands for Federal Funds Rate: i.e. the US key interest rate) Source: http://econimica.blogspot.it/2016/11/trump-lies-no-different-than-obama-or.html \\nAnd then there is China : It too is passing through a difficult \u201ctransition\u201d from the old economy to an \u201cinnovative\u201d one. It too, has an aging population and a debt problem (with a debt-to-gross domestic ratio reaching 247 percent). Trump argues that China deliberately holds down the value of its currency to gain unfair trade advantage, and he further suggests that he intends to confront the Chinese government on this key issue. \\nAgain, Trump does have a point (many nations are managing their exchange rates precisely in order to try to \u201csteal\u201d a little bit extra growth from the diminished global pot). But as noted at Zerohedge, citing the analysis of One River Asset Management executive Eric Peters: \\n\u201cWhat\u2019s good for the US in this case [the rising dollar and interest rates in anticipation of \u2018Trumponomics\u2019], is not good for emerging markets (EMs). Emerging markets benefit from a weaker dollar, and you\u2019re not going to get that. Emerging markets benefit from global capital flows moving in their direction and that\u2019s not happening either. Back in February, emerging markets were in sharp decline, driven by (1) a strong dollar, (2) rising US interest rates, and (3) slowing Chinese growth. Then China spurred a massive credit stimulus, the Fed became wildly dovish, and the dollar declined sharply. \\n\u201cInterest rates collapsed throughout the year. As the growing pool of dollar, euro and yen liquidity searched for a decent return, it headed to emerging markets. Trump has reignited the dollar rally, and his fiscal stimulus will force interest rates higher. This reversed everything. [the dollars are heading home] \\n\u201cAnd to be sure, the Beijing boys don\u2019t want to see material weakness ahead of next autumn\u2019s Party Congress. But we\u2019re currently near peak impulse from China\u2019s Q1 stimulus.\u201d \\nIn short, Peters is saying that, with the appreciating dollar and rising interest rate environment, growth from emerging markets as a whole will falter, since emerging markets have effectively leveraged their economies to Chinese growth. It used to be the case that they were closely tied to U.S. growth, but it is now China which dominates the EMs\u2019 trade flows [i.e. without China growth, the EMs languish]. The question is, can America reboot its growth whilst China and the EMs languish? It is another structural shift, whereas heretofore, it was vice versa: without U.S. growth, the EMs and China languished. Now it is the converse. \\nHollowed-Out Economies \\nThere are other structural changes of course which will make it harder for the industrially hollowed-out economies of the West to recuperate jobs off-shored earlier. Firstly, there has been a systemic shift of innovation and technology eastwards (often to a more skilled and better-educated workforce). This represents not only an economic event, but a redistribution of power too. In any case, technology in this new era is being more job destructive than creative. \\nIn one sense, Trump\u2019s economic plan to \u201cget America working again\u201d through massive debt-financed, infrastructure projects, harks back to the Reagan era, which was also a period in which the dollar was strong. But yet again, \u201cthings today are not what they were then.\u201d Inflation then was at 13 percent, Interest rates were around 20 percent, and crucially, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio was a mere 35 percent (compared to today\u2019s estimate of 71.8 percent or 104.5 percent with external debt included). \\nThen, as Jack Rickards has suggested , the strong dollar was deflationary (deliberately so), and interest rates had nowhere to go, but down. It was the beginning of the three decades\u2019 bond boom, which finally seems to have come to an end, coincident with Trump\u2019s election. Today, inflation has nowhere to go but up \u2013 as have interest rates \u2013 and the bond market, nowhere to go, but (perilously) down. \\nGrowth and Jobs? \\nCan Trump then achieve growth and jobs through infrastructure expenditure? Well, \u201cgrowth\u201d is an ambiguous, shape-shifting term. The first chart shows both sides of the equation \u2026 the annual GDP growth and the annual federal debt incurred, spent, and (thus counted as part of the growth) to achieve the purported growth. Source: http://econimica.blogspot.it/2016/11/trump-lies-no-different-than-obama-or.html \\nThe second chart shows the annual GDP minus the annual growth in federal debt to achieve that \u201cGDP growth.\u201d In other words, unlike in the earlier Reagan times, more recently, the debt is producing no growth \u2013 but \u2026 well \u2026 just more debt, mostly. \\nIn fact, what the second chart is reflecting is the dilution \u2013 through money \u201cprinting\u201d \u2013 of purchasing power: away from one entity (the American consumer), through the intermediation of the financial sector, to other entities (mostly financial entities, and to corporations buying back their own shares). This is debt deflation: the American consumer ends having less and less purchasing power (in the sense of residual discretionary income). \\nThe point here is that \u201cgrowth\u201d is becoming rarer everywhere. Russia and China, like everyone else, are in search for new sources for growth. \\nAs Rickards has said, debt is the \u201cdevil\u201d that can undo Trump\u2019s whole schema: a \u201c$1 trillion infrastructure refurbishment plan, along with his proposal to rebuild the military, will \u2014 at least in the short-term \u2014 significantly increase annual deficits. In fact, deficits are already soaring; the fiscal 2016 budget hole jumped to $587 billion, up from $438 in the prior year, for a huge 34% increase\u2026in addition to this, Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies would implement either a 35% tariff on certain imports or would require these goods to be produced inside the United States, at much higher prices. For example, the increase in labor costs from goods made in China would be 190% when compared to the federally mandated minimum wage earner in the United States. Hence, inflation is on the way.\u201d \\nIn sum, self-sufficiency implies higher domestic costs and price rises for consumers. Source: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-16/saudis-china-dump-treasuries-foreign-central-banks-liquidate-record-375-billion-us-p \\nDebt will rise. And there is seemingly already a buyers\u2019 strike against U.S. government debt underway: well over a third of a $1 trillion worth of Treasuries were disposed of, and sold in the year to Aug. 31 by foreign Central Banks. \\nAnd who is buying it? (Below, the chart shows what this purchasing looks like, as a percentage of total debt issued by the Treasury). Well, foreign central banks have disappeared. (The Chinese have not bought a U.S. Treasury bond since 2011.) (Above: who purchased the marketable debt as a percentage, by period)Source: http://econimica.blogspot.it/2016/11/trump-lies-no-different-than-obama-or.html \\nIt is the American public who are buying. Will they be willing to take on Trump\u2019s $1 trillion infrastructure spree? Or, will it be \u201cprinted\u201d in yet another dilution of the American consumer\u2019s purchasing power? The question of whether the infrastructure splurge does give growth hangs very much in the balance to such answers. (Equity shares in construction firms will do okay, of course). \\nThe bottom line: (Michael Pento, Pento Report ): \u201cIf interest rates continue to rise it won\u2019t just be bond prices that will collapse. It will be every asset that has been priced off that so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 offered by sovereign debt. The painful lesson will then be learned that having a virtual zero interest rate policy for the past 90 months wasn\u2019t at all risk free. All of the asset prices negative interest rates have so massively distorted including; corporate debt, municipal bonds, REITs, CLOs, equities, commodities, luxury cars, art, all fixed income assets and their proxies, and everything in between, will fall concurrently along with the global economy. \\n\u201cFor the record, a normalization of bond yields would be very healthy for the economy in the long-run, as it is necessary to reconcile the massive economic imbalances now in existence. However, President Trump will want no part of the depression that would run concurrently with collapsing real estate, equity and bond prices.\u201d \\nA Pending Financial Crisis \\nTrump, to be fair, has said consistently throughout the election campaign that whoever won the Presidential campaign to take office in January would face a financial crisis. Perhaps he will not face the \u201cviolent unwind\u201d of the QE and bond bubble as some experts have predicted , but many more \u2013 according to Bank of America\u2019s survey of 177 fund managers over the last six days, and controlling just under half a trillion of assets \u2013 expect a \u201cstagflationary bond crash.\u201d \\nThis has major political implications. Trump is setting out to do no less than transform the economy and foreign policy of the U.S. He is doing this against a backdrop of many of the followers of the liberal \u00e9lite, so angered at the election outcome, that they reject completely his electoral legitimacy (and, with the \u00e9lites themselves staying mum at this rejection of the U.S. democratic process). Movements are being organized to wreck his Presidency (see here for example). If Trump does indeed experience a severe financial \u201cunwind\u201d at a time of such domestic anger and agitation, matters could turn quite ugly. \\nAlastair Crooke is a former British diplomat who was a senior figure in British intelligence and in European Union diplomacy.
