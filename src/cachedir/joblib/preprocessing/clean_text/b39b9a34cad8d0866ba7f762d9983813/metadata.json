As I was returning from a polling station in the southern city of Lahore, military intelligence officials flagged down my car. Hours later I was on a plane out of the country, having been deported. Elections are a fraught business in many parts of the world. In many of those countries, the American way of choosing a president seems ideal, however imperfect. The electoral machine resembles a classic,   limousine: large, showy and expensive, yet robust and broadly predictable. This year\u2019s race, at the outset, looked set to follow in that vein as a contest between the scions of two storied political dynasties, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. Then the upstart billionaire and reality TV star Donald J. Trump thrust himself into the fray, shredding the script, dismissing Mr. Bush and upending most notions of what is possible, or acceptable, in an American political contest. I have come from my regular base in Cairo to the United States to help with The New York Times\u2019s coverage of the 2016 campaign. You might wonder what I can add, given that I\u2019m Irish and my American colleagues are already producing a stream of illuminating and incisive stories. I hope to supplement that coverage with reporting that responds to the queries of our international readers, and approaches the election  \u2014   in all its drama, significance and absurdity  \u2014   in much the same way as we would events abroad. The series will be called Abroad in America. This feverish political season has transfixed the world outside America, too. The election\u2019s first act  \u2014   the primary contests, when the two main parties select their ultimate candidates  \u2014   attracts an unusual degree of international scrutiny. Violence at rallies, incendiary speeches, race baiting, attacks on journalists and judges, proposals to bar Muslims or Mexicans  \u2014   the primaries signaled a sudden sea change that left   watching with fascination, puzzlement and a profound sense of trepidation. For some countries, the changes resonate strongly at home. Mr. Trump\u2019s success chimes with nationalist surges across Europe and the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote. Disillusionment with traditional elites, hostility toward immigrants and anger among the losers from globalization  \u2014   all resonate elsewhere. Yet it is odd and disturbing to hear terms like fascism and demagogy, most frequently associated with the European fringe or rickety   governments, being used in the context of an American campaign. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign is haunted by the high levels of hostility even among many voters on the left. And so the election, which starts in earnest in the coming weeks, is shaping up as a close unpopularity contest: In the latest polls, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton both have 40 percent support. But it is not just about the winner in November. The process has thrown up urgent new questions  \u2014   about race, guns and the global economy, among others  \u2014   as well as anguished soul searching about the very process of selecting a president. Where will the politics of resentment and anger ultimately lead? Does the United States suffer, as one writer suggested, from too much democracy? Could this be an \u201c  event\u201d for representative government? My reporting will focus more at ground level. Some of my efforts will be explanatory  \u2014   unraveling the intricacies and curiosities like the Electoral College, a source of befuddlement to many foreigners (and some Americans). More broadly, though, I hope to turn my focus as a foreign correspondent to deciphering the fears, hopes and motivations that are driving voters of every hue, and will determine the most powerful leader on the planet. My journey will also be driven by you, the readers. I\u2019ll be posting on Twitter and Instagram, and soliciting your questions and concerns. What infuriates, intrigues or mystifies you about the elections? I\u2019ll be starting the journey on Monday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Please join me on the way.'"}, "time": 1742563012.217149}
