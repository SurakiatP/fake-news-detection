Washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power. \\nCarter\u2019s claim that US ground forces will have no part in the fight against Daesh came at a time when more than 5,000 American soldiers were stationed in Iraq, tasked with providing training and intelligence to Iraqi forces.
