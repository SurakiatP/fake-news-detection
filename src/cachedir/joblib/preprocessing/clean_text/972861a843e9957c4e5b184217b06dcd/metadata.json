Mr. Assange moved into the embassy in Knightsbridge, one of the British capital\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods, after accusations of rape in Sweden, which he has described as a   for an American effort to extradite him and try him on espionage charges. Whether Ecuador will continue its role of reluctant warden to Mr. Assange, who was granted asylum by President Rafael Correa in 2012, hinges on the outcome of the elections. Eight candidates are seeking the presidency, and at least two have said they would evict him if they won. If balloting reflects recent poll results, it is unlikely that Mr. Assange would need to pack his bags anytime soon: While Mr. Correa\u2019s preferred successor, Len\u00edn Moreno, is the   polls indicate that the election is likely to go to a second round, meaning that Mr. Assange\u2019s fate may not be decided until a runoff in early April. If Guillermo Lasso of Creating Opportunities or Cynthia Viteri of the Social Christian Party pull off an upset, however, it could be a different fate altogether. \u201cAs president of this nation, I need the money used for his upkeep, for example to pay for my children\u2019s school lunches,\u201d Ms. Viteri said about Mr. Assange,  the newspaper El Comercio reported on Thursday. \u201cI withdraw his asylum,\u201d she said, \u201cfor the purchase, in my opinion, of Mr. Assange\u2019s silence. \u201d She did not elaborate. Ms. Viteri was a distant third in two recent polls, with about 14 percent of support. In the past, Mr. Lasso has supported Mr. Assange\u2019s stay at the embassy, but he expressed a different view in comments to The Guardian last week. \u201cThe Ecuadorean people have been paying a cost that we should not have to bear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will cordially ask Se\u00f1or Assange to leave within 30 days of assuming a mandate. \u201d Foreign Minister Guillaume Long has rejected the idea that Mr. Assange might be forced to leave the embassy. \u201cWe\u2019ve ratified his asylum several times, and under this government, there is no decision to revoke it at all,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that Julian Assange was granted asylum on grounds of fear of possible political persecution. \u201d Mr. Moreno, the   did not make much of the issue of Mr. Assange\u2019s fate during the campaign, which has focused on economic matters at a time of falling oil prices. Speculation that Mr. Assange was overstaying his welcome grew when the embassy cut off his access to the internet in October, shortly before elections in the United States. WikiLeaks had published tens of thousands of hacked emails from inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want any ambiguity,\u201d Mr. Long said of his country\u2019s decision to cut off Mr. Assange\u2019s online access. \u201cWe wanted it to be very clear that Ecuador\u2019s diplomatic mission was not being used in order to interfere in the U. S. electoral process. \u201d Mr. Long said that Mr. Assange, whom he last saw in June, lived in \u201cextremely tough conditions,\u201d in a small space with very little light. \u201cLondon is not exactly the most luminous city, and it has a long winter,\u201d he said. The foreign minister revealed some weariness with the length of Mr. Assange\u2019s time at the embassy, The Guardian reported, asking for Sweden to speed up its investigation as \u201cthis has been going on for far too long. \u201d But in the interview on Friday, he dismissed the idea that providing refuge to Mr. Assange came at a financial cost that Ecuadoreans could not afford. Rather, he said, the cost is political. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a principled decision, and it speaks highly of a country that defends its ideals, not just petty interests,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving one more person in the embassy is a marginal addition to the cost of running the embassy,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat\u2019s the cost of having someone in the bedroom?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562190.0355341}
