Mr. Trump spent his first weekend in office at war with math. He said on Saturday that his inauguration crowd  \u2014   which photographs showed was dwarfed by Barack Obama\u2019s estimated 1. 8 million in 2009  \u2014   \u201clooked like a million, a million and a half. \u201d His staff members backed up that claim with what his adviser Kellyanne Conway memorably termed \u201calternative facts. \u201d For the political news media, the brazenness was stunning. But those of us who cover television have seen this kind of thing before: the inventions of a celebrity, surrounded by yes men and women, who creates his own reality. We recognize it because, not so long ago, that celebrity was Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump has a reputation among TV reporters for using his own bespoke numbers. In 2015, he came to a Television Critics Association panel for his final season hosting \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\u201d and declared it \u201cthe Number 1 show on television. \u201d It was not. Publicly available Nielsen ratings flatly proved that. Pressed by reporters, he insisted that it was at least the   show on Monday nights. It was not that either. (It finished the season 67th.) It was a bizarre performance even by the usual   standards of the critics association sessions. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was, in its first season, a genuine hit. It declined afterward, but hung on as a modest performer. That\u2019s no mean feat. But that wasn\u2019t enough for Mr. Trump. So it wasn\u2019t true for Mr. Trump. Last year, Mr. Trump\u2019s former \u201cApprentice\u201d publicist, Jim Dowd, was interviewed for the PBS \u201cFrontline\u201d election documentary \u201cThe Choice. \u201d Mr. Trump, he recalled, would demand that he call up   reporters and tell them, \u201cNumber 1 show on television, won its time slot,\u201d even if \u201cwe were Number 72. \u201d (Mr. Dowd died in September.) Mr. Trump has always used an aspirational calculator. As a real estate developer, he built Trump Tower with 58 stories and declared it 68 stories tall. He carried his scorekeeping obsession into his celebrity career. For his 2011 Comedy Central roast, The Huffington Post reported, writers were told not to joke about Mr. Trump being less wealthy than he says he is. He edited a gag that said he lived in a \u201c   penthouse atop my   space station,\u201d raising the square footage to 50, 000. Running for president meant a new set of ways to keep score, and fudge it: The polls  \u2014   rigged, unless they favored him. His rally attendance  \u2014   huge, yet not too huge for him to embellish. And, again, the TV ratings, and not just for his own events. On Twitter, two weeks before his inauguration, he taunted Arnold Schwarzenegger, his replacement on \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d for getting \u201c\u2018swamped\u2019 (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. \u201d If you knew all this, then you knew, when you saw the expanses of white space on the National Mall on Friday, that Defcon 1 klaxons were going to be blaring in the command center of Mr. Trump\u2019s ego. He would be made small. His crowds would be smaller than Mr. Obama\u2019s  \u2014   smaller than the Women\u2019s March! It would be in pictures, on TV, where things are the most real of all. It would make him look, in his understanding of the world, like a loser. Donald J. Trump is not a loser. Ergo, it was not true. The smaller turnout for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration is actually a decent symbol of his election victory, in which he lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes but won the presidency on the strength of an intense base. To put it again in TV terms, Mr. Trump won by   rather than broadcasting. He identified a key demographic in the right markets and successfully targeted it. His margin of victory in the decisive states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin was just over 77, 000 votes combined, around the average audience of the   NBC Universo channel. This is a perfectly valid strategy, in politics and in TV. And in practice, Mr. Trump has embraced the politics of   not just in the campaign but in his inaugural speech, which made no effort to reach beyond his base. But as much as Mr. Trump has adapted to modern media, he is still a    man who came of age in the era of three TV networks, when there were no niche hits. Just as he could not be satisfied with the niche success of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d he seemingly cannot bear being a niche president. It eats at him. He wants to win total viewers, not just the key demo. He doesn\u2019t want to change to achieve that. But he wants the credit. Thus his repeated lie that he would have won the popular vote if not for \u201cmillions\u201d who voted illegally. Thus the   inaugural fans he conjured up like extra floors to sell a condo building. Celebrities have support staff dedicated to maintaining their bubbles. (Even Mr. Trump\u2019s bringing staff members to cheer him at events  \u2014   like his first postelection news conference  \u2014   is familiar from the critics association panels. Journalists are professionally forbidden from applauding the celebrities they cover, so network staffers whoop it up to massage their stars\u2019 egos.) Mr. Trump has his press secretary, Sean Spicer, and Ms. Conway, each playing their version of the bulldog Hollywood publicist. Their job is to keep the talent happy. In a news briefing on Monday, Mr. Spicer essentially argued that the   comparisons were accurate, but it was \u201cdemoralizing\u201d for the news media to make them. With these enablers around him, don\u2019t expect Mr. Trump to change much. On Sunday, he   that \u201c31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s TV ratings were also about 7 million viewers lower than Mr. Obama\u2019s first inaugural in 2009. Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to treat truth as negotiable was idiosyncratic in a TV star. In a president, it\u2019s disturbing. Alternative facts are what they use in alternatives to democracy. If anything, presidents receive more grades and metrics than candidates do, from approval polls  \u2014   rigged again, apparently  \u2014   to unemployment figures, which Mr. Trump cast doubt on when they were favorable to Mr. Obama. Every sign says that Mr. Trump will respond to these figures exactly as he has in the past: as the TV star, up early in the morning, stewing, waiting for the overnight ratings to come in.'"}, "time": 1742628516.7080996}
