Can\\'t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV. On March 4, 2015, two days after the e-mail in which Podesta wrote, \u201cwe are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later,\u201d the House Select Committee on Benghazi subpoenaed Clinton demanding \u201cany and all documents and communications in your possession, and/or sent from or received by the email adresses [sic] \u2018 ,\u2019 \u2018 ,\u2019 or any other email adress [sic] or communications device used by you or another on your behalf, referring or relating to\u201d the committee\u2019s investigation into Benghazi. The subpoena specifically demanded all such \u201ccommunications\u201d \u201cfor the time period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.\u201d Clinton \u2014 in a possible move to buy more time to \u201cdump all those emails\u201d \u2014 falsely claimed that she had not been subpoenaed. The committee responded by making the subpoena public. Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy wrote, \u201cI would not make this [subpoena] public now, but after Secretary Clinton falsely claimed the committee did not subpoena her, I have no choice in order to correct the inaccuracy.\u201d The press release , dated July 18, 2015 says, in part: \u201cThe committee has issued several subpoenas, but I have not sought to make them public,\" said committee Chairman Trey Gowdy. \u201cI would not make this one public now, but after Secretary Clinton falsely claimed the committee did not subpoena her, I have no choice in order to correct the inaccuracy. The committee immediately subpoenaed Clinton personally after learning the full extent of her unusual email arrangement with herself, and would have done so earlier if the State Department or Clinton had been forthcoming that State did not maintain custody of her records and only Secretary Clinton herself had her records when Congress first requested them.\u201d \u201cThe fact remains, despite when this subpoena was issued, Secretary Clinton had a statutory duty to preserve records from her entire time in office, and she had a legal duty to cooperate with and tell the truth to congressional investigators requesting her records going back to September of 2012. Yet despite direct congressional inquiry, she refused to inform the public of her unusual email arrangement. This information only came to light because of a Select Committee request, not a voluntary decision to turn over records almost two years after leaving office, records which always should have been in State\u2019s custody.\" \"Moreover, the timing of the Secretary\\'s decision to delete and attempt to permanently destroy emails is curious at best. The Secretary left office in February of 2013. By her own admission she did not delete or destroy emails until the fall of 2014, well after this Committee had been actively engaged in securing her emails from the Department of State. For 20 months, it was not too burdensome or cumbersome for the Secretary to house records on her personal server but mysteriously in the fall of 2014 she decided to delete and attempt to permanently destroy those same records.\" The press release contains a link to the actual subpoena . As the press release makes clear, \u201cBy her own admission\u201d Hillary Clinton \u201cdid not delete or destroy emails until the fall of 2014.\u201d What is left unclear is this: If those e-mails had already been deleted (as she claimed), then what e-mails was Podesta referring to when he said they were \u201cgoing to have to dump\u201d them \u201csooner\u201d rather than \u201clater\u201d? And if the e-mails had been deleted in 2014, why did Hillary have her server wiped using BleachBit before turning it over to investigators? It is hopeful that two things will happen following this most recent disclosure. The first is that this will find its way into the newly reopened investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of the private, unsecured server. The second is that WikiLeaks will release additional pieces of the puzzle to clarify what is still unclear. With less than a week left until the election, it is likely to be an exciting few days.
