REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo \\nTwenty six black Christian leaders have issued Hillary Clinton a powerful letter regarding religious freedom, education, unemployment, abortion and violence decimating their communities. (VERO BEACH, FL) Black leaders slammed Hillary Clinton\u2019s position toward the poor in a letter delivered to her campaign Monday, saying her economic ideas won\u2019t help black communities in crisis and that her social views pose a threat to their religious liberty. \\n\u201cToday in the United States more than ten million people of African descent face a crisis of catastrophic proportion,\u201d it says. \u201cAs leaders of the Pentecostal-Charismatic wing of the black church, we are requesting a meeting with you to discuss some of the critical issues in the black community: education and employment, religious freedom, violence, and justice for the unborn.\u201d \\n\u201cHow do you justify your unconscionable silence in the face of such destruction of innocent black life? Don\u2019t black lives matter?\u201d they ask Clinton about abortion. \\nThey continue : \\nSecretary Clinton, we are also very concerned about your position regarding unborn children and the black church\u2019s commitment to defend them. In April 2015 in a speech before the National Organization of Women you stated \u201cFar too many women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth\u2026 Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed\u2026\u201d \\nFor political leaders to call for changes in citizens\u2019 beliefs is reminiscent of totalitarianism. In our view, such a proposal constitutes a denial of our religious freedom. \\nThe vast majority of black churches hold biblical teaching, which is eternal, as authoritative for doctrine and practice. Abortion is the deliberate destruction of a human life in its most vulnerable state. Biblical principle and natural law, both of which prohibit the taking of innocent human life, compel our concern about the increasing moral complicity with abortion. \\nFor the same reasons that we as black Christian leaders oppose racism, unjust wars, capital punishment and euthanasia, we oppose the violent denial of life to the unborn through abortion. It is our view that human life is a gift of God that we are called upon to protect, nurture and sustain, because we are created in God\u2019s image. Therefore, our opposition to abortion is a logical outgrowth of our view that there must be justice for all. \\nParticularly relevant is the innocence of the unborn child. The Bible places an extremely high value on human life and particularly on the lives of the innocent who are under the special protection of God. Those who take the life of the innocent violate a key biblical principle as well as a fundamental principle of natural justice. \\nAbortion in the black community has had a catastrophic impact. Nationally there are 365 black babies aborted for every 1,000 that are born. Blacks account for roughly 38% of all abortions in the country though we represent only 13% of the population. In New York City, the situation is absolutely dire. \\nAccording to a report prepared by the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, in 2013 there were more abortions among black women in the city, 29,007, than there were black babies born, 24,108. Both nationally and in New York City, the abortion rates among black women are much higher than among any other demographic group. (This claim has been fact-checked by Politifact and deemed to be accurate.) In New York City more black babies are dying in their mother\u2019s womb than are being born. \\nIn 2008, Secretary Clinton, you took the position that abortion should be rare, and you emphasized \u201cby rare I mean rare.\u201d But Black babies are dying at terrifying rates. \\nHow do you justify your unconscionable silence in the face of such destruction of innocent black life? Don\u2019t black lives matter? What policies would you pursue as president to reverse the soaring abortion rates among black women? \\nOn Monday afternoon, Dr. Jacqueline C. Rivers presented the letter to Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn campaign headquarters requesting a meeting. \\nSignatures to the letter: Presiding Bishop Charles E.
