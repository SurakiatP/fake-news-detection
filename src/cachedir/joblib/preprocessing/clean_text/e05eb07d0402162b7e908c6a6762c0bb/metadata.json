Then, around 11 a. m. an explosion interrupted the quiet. Officials said a young man walking in the southeastern end of the park stepped on what turned out to be explosive material that had been left behind. Investigators believe it was part of an \u201cexperiment with fireworks,\u201d police officials said, and declined to call the material a device. The police said they do not believe it was connected to terrorism. \u201cIt is not unusual for the public to make or try to create homemade fireworks around the Fourth of July,\u201d said John O\u2019Connell, a deputy police chief for counterterrorism with the New York Police Department. Soon after the blast, social media posts circulated describing a grisly scene, the victim bloodied and maimed. And there was a rush of journalists and police officers who, coincidentally, were already nearby for the funeral services of Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize winner. Even President Obama was briefed about the explosion. The jolt escalated quickly from there as some news organizations reported that the authorities were shutting down Central Park, a colossal undertaking  \u2014   clearing out the   park  \u2014   that would have indicated something worse than an accident involving fireworks had taken place. Those reports were quickly dismissed by police officials as erroneous, but still, fear and anxiety had been stirred around the park. \u201cWe are worried,\u201d Giselle Brown, 42, said as she sat on a bench on Fifth Avenue with relatives visiting from Nicaragua. \u201cWe want to know exactly what happened. \u201d After the explosion, the man  \u2014   Connor Golden, who was visiting from Fairfax, Va.  \u2014   was lying against a boulder with his left leg below the calf severely wounded. Someone had tied a strip of blue fabric around his leg as a tourniquet before emergency workers carried him from the park on a stretcher. The authorities said Mr. Golden was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, where he was in serious but stable condition. He was undergoing surgery, officials said on Sunday evening. They added that they believe Mr. Golden, who was with two friends at the time, had stumbled upon the material. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d one of the friends, Thomas Hinds, told reporters near the scene. \u201cThere was a small explosion. And then dust. \u201d Lt. Mark Torre, the commander of the Police Department\u2019s bomb squad, said he believed the man had encountered homemade fireworks that did not appear to be designed to explode from contact. \u201cTheir goal is to make a loud noise,\u201d Lieutenant Torre said, \u201cmaybe make a flash. \u201d The material, he said, could have been left behind days ago. Later on Sunday, a swath of the park, starting from East 61st Street and heading a few blocks north, remained cordoned off as investigators from the Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were still at work. Mohammad Matin, 58, left his cart selling ice cream, pretzels, soda and churros when the police told him to leave the area. He went home to Jackson Heights, Queens, leaving the cart unattended for hours. \u201cI was really upset,\u201d Mr. Matin said. \u201cToday is Sunday, a very big day for business. I lost my business. \u201d Abdul Abdul, 29, heard something while working at a halal food stand outside the park. \u201cI thought a tire had popped,\u201d Mr. Abdul said. But he was stunned to hear what had happened. \u201cOh my God,\u201d said Mr. Abdul, who has worked at the stand for about a year and a half. \u201cI have never seen anything happen in Central Park before. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628467.3815026}
