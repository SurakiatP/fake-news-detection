He likens it to his own experience as a young Korean immigrant in Houston, watching \u201cStar Trek\u201d for the first time and homing in on the Asian character. \u201cSeeing George Takei on television was very meaningful to me, and I hope there\u2019s a similar effect for gay kids watching,\u201d he said. Previously best known for a title role in the \u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d movies, Mr. Cho has lately been seen gracing many popular movie posters  \u2014   not just for \u201cStar Trek\u201d  \u2014   thanks to a social media campaign started without his knowledge that imagines him as Captain America, James Bond and other   characters. Earlier this month, Mr. Cho, who was in London for work, spoke by phone about \u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d (due in theaters on Friday, July 22) his surprise at the success of #StarringJohnCho, and why worrying about the challenging reality of being an Asian actor in Hollywood isn\u2019t good for him as an artist. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. My condolences over the loss of your friend and \u201cTrek\u201d   Anton Yelchin. Thank you. He was a special, special kid. We just loved him to pieces, and it\u2019s been very difficult. He was so young. The cast has been together a lot, and we\u2019ve found that as comforting as it can be, under the circumstances. George Takei recently said he was glad there was a gay \u201cStar Trek\u201d character, but he didn\u2019t think it should be Sulu. What did you think when you learned about the decision to write Sulu as gay? It was my understanding that George Takei\u2019s Sulu was heterosexual. We have an alternate timeline in our \u201cStar Trek\u201d universe, but it\u2019s the same genetic Sulu. So I was concerned that people would think we were saying that sexual orientation was a choice and not predetermined. I was also concerned that since it was a bit of a homage to him, George would say, \u201cI\u2019m someone who has worked as a gay actor to craft a straight character, and now you\u2019re seeing just my sexual orientation. \u201d The posture of the filmmakers was that this was normalized in the future and it was nothing, really. It was a big revelation yet handled in a way that communicated it wasn\u2019t anything the crew didn\u2019t already know about him. You mentioned that Mr. Takei was one of few Asian actors you saw growing up. Did the lack of representation affect you? I wish I was strong enough for it not to matter. It does, I have to admit. It still affects me, and not just as an actor. Movies may be as close to a document of our national culture as there is they\u2019re supposed to represent what we believe ourselves to be. So when you don\u2019t see yourself at all  \u2014   or see yourself erased  \u2014   that hurts. The #StarringJohnCho campaign is drawing attention to a lack of diversity onscreen. How did you feel when you saw it? My first reaction was, are they clowning me? I quickly realized it was sincere, and it was kind of amazing. Maybe [it caught on] because the posters made it seem possible. Instead of talking about it or demanding it, it was like, listen, it could be like this. For a minute, people were talking about it in a very serious way. You\u2019ve talked about facing racism in your professional life, not taking roles that rely on stereotypes. You\u2019ve had to think about these issues in a way white actors don\u2019t. You might hear something along the lines of \u201cThey\u2019re not going Asian on this role, because there\u2019s another Asian in the cast,\u201d which is something you\u2019d never hear if you were white. At this stage of my career, it\u2019s more oblique. It can be harder to maneuver your way into the discussion for bigger roles. I get tired of talking about this. I get tired of living with it. The more I have to think about this, the more it makes me feel more like a politician and less of an artist. In the long run, that\u2019s not good for me or anyone else. I don\u2019t like when an   actor says, \u201cI\u2019m entering this business to change Hollywood. \u201d It feels like the wrong reason  \u2014   I would prefer they entered the business for artistic reasons, because they need to do it. I used to get offered roles, and if I felt they were a stereotype, I would [ask] my Korean friends, \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d I would go through these exhausting mental hoops, arguing both sides in my head, picturing this imaginary   council judging the role. I spent so much energy on that. Now I\u2019m older, and I\u2019m thinking, that\u2019s not healthy! It\u2019s antithetical to the artistic impulse. Actors are supposed to be these runaways that get in a covered wagon filled with hats and tambourines and go from town to town making people smile. Though it\u2019s logical and necessary to think and talk about all of this, it\u2019s a bummer as an artist to have to do it all the time. What are some roles you\u2019d love to take on? I\u2019d love to do a Shakespearean role onscreen. There are some radical things I\u2019d like to do. I\u2019d like to be in a western. I\u2019d like to be ultraviolent onscreen it\u2019s completely different from anything I\u2019ve done. Because I sidestepped all the stereotypical roles, in a way I\u2019ve made a career out of not being Asian  \u2014   a lot of my roles weren\u2019t written as Asian  \u2014   so there\u2019s an impulse in me that wants to take a   and play a very grounded, real Asian character, maybe an immigrant. I\u2019m also tuned in lately to my parents\u2019 generation, thinking about their mortality and all the history that will go with them. I\u2019ve wanted to do a project and record   kids interviewing their parents and grandparents, so we can preserve stories of the Korean diaspora. I guess it\u2019s part of getting older and having kids, you think more about that kind of thing. What are you working on next? Right after this, I\u2019m doing a   movie about a Korean man visiting his father, who has fallen ill in Columbus, Ind. He meets a woman, and they\u2019re both mourning their parents in different ways there\u2019s an interesting relationship. The announcement hasn\u2019t been made, so I can\u2019t talk about it in detail yet, but I\u2019m also acting in and producing a drama in the cable space. What do you like to do when you\u2019re not acting? It\u2019s more like, what do my kids want me to be doing? [My wife, the actress Kerri Higuchi, and I] have two kids, 8 and 3. I have this fantasy of just being left alone for a week, so I can clean out the house and garage.'"}, "time": 1742628572.2367017}
