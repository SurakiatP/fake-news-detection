That dynamic, adapted from Akira Kurosawa\u2019s \u201cSeven Samurai,\u201d endures in the director Antoine Fuqua\u2019s update of \u201cThe Magnificent Seven,\u201d in which Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Chris Pratt and others are the mismatched gunslingers Peter Sarsgaard is the ruthless industrialist they are set against. If its story remains fundamentally the same, Mr. Fuqua\u2019s film, which Columbia Pictures and MGM will release on Sept. 23, features a more diverse cast, like an Asian   assassin (played by   Lee) a Native American warrior (Martin Sensmeier) and a Mexican outlaw (Manuel  ) in addition to Mr. Washington as the warrant officer leading the squad. Of course, Mr. Fuqua, Mr. Hawke and Mr. Washington are not strangers to one another: They worked together on \u201cTraining Day,\u201d the brutal 2001 crime drama for which Mr. Washington won an Academy Award. (Mr. Fuqua has also directed Mr. Hawke in \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s Finest\u201d and Mr. Washington in \u201cThe Equalizer. \u201d) Before the premiere of \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d at the Toronto International Film Festival this month, these three collaborators came together to talk about the creation of their western remake to reflect on the making of \u201cTraining Day\u201d and to discuss problems of diversity that persist in Hollywood. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Were westerns part of your cultural upbringings? DENZEL WASHINGTON I grew up with \u201cBonanza. \u201d I didn\u2019t see anybody that looked like me. I was vibing on Hop Sing for some reason. Why don\u2019t we see Hop Sing more? ETHAN HAWKE When I was growing up, my father would sleep all day Sunday. And on Channel 11, they would play \u201cThe Big Valley,\u201d \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d \u201cBonanza. \u201d Then a Howard Hawks movie and then the Clint Eastwood TV shows. ANTOINE FUQUA My grandmother was a huge western fan. She\u2019d have me watch with her. \u201cShane,\u201d \u201cBonanza,\u201d \u201cDuel in the Sun,\u201d I saw them all with her. I used to watch them until the TV turned to snow. Did you take on this project because you were specifically interested in remaking \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d? FUQUA MGM called me. I figured I\u2019d never get a chance to do a western. Then they said it was \u201cThe Magnificent Seven,\u201d and you hesitate a little bit. \u201cSeven Samurai\u201d was amazing, and Kurosawa was the master. That decision wasn\u2019t easy. Remakes have been done forever. People talk about \u201cScarface\u201d and don\u2019t even know it was a remake. HAWKE I have attachments to [the first \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d]. You fall in love with all those guys. But there\u2019s something about a story of male friendships we could build on. But you were never chained down by the title. You made the movie you wanted to. FUQUA If I was chained down to anything, it was  \u2014   \u2014   WASHINGTON The music? [Starts to sing.] Dun,   . FUQUA I wanted to make sure we stayed true to what Kurosawa was saying. \u201cSeven Samurai\u201d was all about men giving the ultimate sacrifice for others. To do something where you\u2019d give your life for the right reason. As long as we stayed on that path, that\u2019s the right path. Did the actors go through any special training for \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d? WASHINGTON You get a horse, you get a gun. Figure it out. No point in getting a plane. And get them boots on, quick as you can. Them boots is serious. I found a couple of pairs that were biting  \u2014   I\u2019m like, O. K. these aren\u2019t going to work. FUQUA They\u2019re on their feet all day, in the dirt and the sand. When it rains, it sinks in. It\u2019s painful. There\u2019s some details they don\u2019t put in the outdoor adventure manual. Was it important to you that your film have a black lead? FUQUA I didn\u2019t think about it as a black lead. WASHINGTON What does that mean, a black lead? I\u2019ve never been one. People make movies and write about what they know, and what they\u2019ve experienced. I\u2019m sure Scorsese could\u2019ve done \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d and Spielberg maybe could\u2019ve done \u201cGoodfellas. \u201d But there\u2019s a culture. These are  . HAWKE He cast Denzel because he likes Denzel\u2019s acting. To white America, I think that will have some power. The western is an iconography that the Dick Cheneys of the world feel is theirs. And the world is changing, and it\u2019s wonderful to see. But that doesn\u2019t affect us playing it or doing it. If we think like that, we\u2019re a bunch of chumps. This is a year when audiences have become particularly aware of issues of diversity in Hollywood. Do you feel like you\u2019re seeing progress being made on this front? WASHINGTON It\u2019s not like everybody sits down and has committee meetings every six months to see how we\u2019re doing as a group. There\u2019s no Black Hollywood. People are making movies, and there are more opportunities now than ever before because there are more outlets than ever before. FUQUA We can always improve everything. Hollywood has to improve it. It will. WASHINGTON Listen, it\u2019s called show business. This ain\u2019t philanthropy. If I give you $25 million, and you go make a movie, I don\u2019t want to hear about what the experience was for you. I want my money back, with profit. Or you\u2019re not getting $25 million from me next time. Now is that because I\u2019m black and you\u2019re white? No, it\u2019s because this is business. I gave you $25 million. \u201cYeah, D, we blew everything. But the culture is  \u2014   \u201d Yeah, O. K. Bye, partner. You remember you said that when you come asking me for some money. HAWKE Everybody\u2019s going to be   when it makes a ton of money. Denzel, you have a film adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s \u201cFences,\u201d which you\u2019re starring in and directing, coming later this year. Was there anything from \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d you could bring to that experience? WASHINGTON I stole from a real filmmaker [indicates Mr. Fuqua]. He had five cameras  \u2014   I had two. FUQUA It\u2019s frustrating, right? He\u2019s editing now. He\u2019s deep in it again. WASHINGTON I should go back and apologize to every director I\u2019ve ever worked with. Because I had no idea how hard it is. Now I\u2019ve got 200 people waiting on me: \u201cWhat do you want, D?\u201d Huh? You\u2019d better act like you can direct. Antoine, had you been looking for an opportunity to get these actors back together since \u201cTraining Day\u201d? FUQUA It\u2019s always on my mind. On \u201cTraining Day,\u201d I used to sit on an apple box and just watch these guys. It was like being at a play. WASHINGTON When you were casting Ethan, you had to believe that this was a guy who could walk down that empty street by himself and those people back there respect him. I won\u2019t talk about some other folk who didn\u2019t have the weight. [Laughter.] HAWKE It was fascinating to see you [Mr. Washington] work at that high a level, in a studio movie. You can see people working like that, in church basements, with confidence and creativity. But when big money comes around and pressure comes around, people shrink. It was an exciting moment to see that that didn\u2019t have to be. Can you assume that the camaraderie from that previous film will carry over? WASHINGTON It\u2019s so different. I mean, we\u2019re on horses. The older I get, the more I appreciate each opportunity. You start to go, You\u2019ve probably made more movies, D, than you\u2019re going to make the rest of your days. If you don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t go. When you do go, and it\u2019s a great ride, then you want to give your all. Some days, not getting along is what helps. Some days it\u2019s 107 degrees. You just don\u2019t feel like it. \u201cI know I\u2019m supposed to shoot him, but I\u2019m going to shoot him. \u201d [Laughter.] Are the three of you looking to make another movie together? HAWKE Somebody asked John Lennon why he wasn\u2019t going to sing with Paul McCartney anymore, and, supposedly, he said, \u201cSing what?\u201d Clearly we like working together. So what? Is it for the right reason? WASHINGTON Otherwise it\u2019s called lunch. [Laughter.'"}, "time": 1742561846.2340474}
