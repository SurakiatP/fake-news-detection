What you hear a lot is that it\u2019s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician,\u201d said a former FBI official. \\nSources who disputed the depth of Trump\u2019s internal support agreed that the FBI is now in parlous political territory. Justice department officials \u2013 another current target of FBI dissatisfaction \u2013 have said the bureau disregarded longstanding rules against perceived or actual electoral interference when Comey wrote to Congress to say it was reviewing newly discovered emails relating to Clinton\u2019s personal server.
