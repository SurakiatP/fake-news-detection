Don\u2019t fight us on this,\u201d the RAI added. \\nLarge Tannoy speakers have been erected across Irish towns and cities, armed with subtle messages chosen to induce people into parting with their cash. \\n\u201cAh, they just say things like \u2018spend, spend, spend\u2019 and \u2018your loved ones will hate you forever and disown you if you don\u2019t buy them everything now\u2019, played at a higher level than a Metallica concert on speed. We hope the public start to realise what time of year it is,\u201d senior It\u2019s Never Too Early For Christmas Shopping strategist Henry Mulcahy explained.'"}, "time": 1742563034.8372357}
