However, when she arrived at her rally in Lake Worth, Florida, she attempted to make one move that she hoped no one would notice. \\nThere have been many questions over the course of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign regarding her health. As a result of her age and her lifestyle, there\u2019s no doubt that her body is starting to feel the effects of aging \u2013 whether she likes to admit it or not. \\nHowever, video footage of her recent rally in Florida shows how desperate she is to keep her health problems hidden, but her attempt was met with failure the moment she hit the stage. In fact, the Democratic presidential candidate struggled to climb one single step. The video captures one of her aides rushing towards her side as she attempted to climb up the riser. \\n\u201cShe needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness,\u201d according to The American Mirror . \u201cThe aide extended his hand and Clinton held on tightly as she made her way up the 18 inches.\u201d \\nAlthough Hillary Clinton insists that her health isn\u2019t an issue, the number of incidents she has had paints quite a different picture. If you take a close look at the video, the aide can even be seen standing behind her, reaching for her waist \u2013 probably preparing for the event of her falling. \\nWe have said it time and time again \u2013 she\u2019s not fit to be president. Although her health is a major concern considering how demanding the presidency can be on a person, it\u2019s her disastrous political history that raises, even more, concerns.'"}, "time": 1742564537.4655666}
