The New York Times solicited their perspective, and the responses  \u2014   more than 1, 000 comments from France, Belgium and beyond  \u2014   went much deeper than the question of swimwear. What emerged was a portrait of life as a Muslim woman, veiled or not, in parts of Europe where terrorism has put people on edge. One French term was used dozens of times: \u201cun combat,\u201d or \u201ca struggle,\u201d to live day to day. Many who were born and raised in France described confusion at being told to go home. Courts have struck down some of the bans on burkinis  \u2014   the one in Nice, the site of a horrific terror attack on Bastille Day, was overturned on Thursday  \u2014   but the debate is far from over. \u201cFor years, we have had to put up with dirty looks and threatening remarks,\u201d wrote Taslima Amar, 30, a teacher in Pantin, a suburb of Paris. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to go back home (even though I am home). \u201d Now, Ms. Amar said, she and her husband were looking to leave France. Laurie Abouzeir, 32, said she was considering starting a business caring for children in her home in Toulouse, southern France, because that would allow her to wear a head scarf, frowned upon and even banned in some workplaces. Many women wrote that   bias had intensified after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January 2015, and in Brussels, Paris and  Nice more recently. Halima Djalab Bouguerra, a    student in    France, dated the change further back, to the killings by Mohammed Merah in the southwest of the country in 2012. \u201cThe way people look at us has changed,\u201d Ms. Bouguerra wrote. \u201cTongues have loosened. No one is afraid of telling a Muslim to \u2018go back home\u2019 anymore. \u201d Here are some excerpts from the comments we received. They have been condensed and edited for clarity, and translated for those who wrote in French. _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ _____'"}, "time": 1742562551.477294}
