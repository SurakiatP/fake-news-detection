[\u201cThere has definitely been a significant bias from the local media like nothing like I have ever experienced,\u201d she told Breitbart News in a telephone interview. \u201cBut I intend to have the last laugh when I win tomorrow. \u201d  Handel, a former Georgia Secretary of State, is currently running    with Democrat Jon Ossoff in the race to replace Dr. Tom Price, who was appointed by President Donald Trump as Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year. Ossoff is a newcomer to politics who actually lives outside the district, but who has energized Democratic activists and donors nationwide in the primary race in April by shaping his campaign as a referendum on the Trump administration. Republicans in the district told Breitbart News during a visit Sunday that they were cautiously optimistic, despite poll numbers showing a dead heat or Ossoff with a small but significant lead. Handel shared their optimism: \u201cI feel great about things  \u2014   early voting numbers that we\u2019ve seen look very positive for me, and Republicans tend to be strong on Election Day,\u201d she said. Politico reported on Sunday night that Republicans believe massive early voting numbers  \u2014   over 140, 000  \u2014   favor them, and that they hope to capitalize on the fact that there are more Republican voters in the district. The race has involved some $50 million in spending on both sides, making it the most expensive race in congressional history. On Monday morning, President Trump tweeted his support for the campaign, urging people to \u201c[V]ote now for Karen H\u201d (though early voting ended on Friday): The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security. Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P\u2019s. Vote now for Karen H,  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2017, In the face of Democrats\u2019 efforts to make the race about Trump, Handel said that she had neither distanced herself nor tied herself to the president. \u201cThe only people who want to make this about other things are, frankly, reporters like you and others out there,\u201d she told Breitbart News. \u201cThis race is about the people of the 6th district. \u201d One of the major national issues  \u2014   aside from Trump himself  \u2014   is health care, with Republicans\u2019 ongoing efforts to repeal Obamacare criticized by both liberals (for tampering with an entitlement) and conservatives (for not going far enough). But Handel says that has not been a big factor in the race. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that much of an issue on the ground,\u201d she told Breitbart News. \u201cFor voters in the 6th district, the biggest issue is that Jon Ossoff is from outside the district. \u201d Asked why Democrats in the district did not seem to mind that, Handel said: \u201cHe\u2019s completely aligned with [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi   \u2026     [Democrats] want someone who will march lockstep with the liberal mantra. \u201d Other issues, she said, were \u201cveterans issues, transportation infrastructure, the fight against terrorism, [the] budget, and the economy  \u2014     issues. \u201d Last week, Handel\u2019s campaign were mailed packages that \u201ccontained threatening letters and a suspicious substance. \u201d She told Breitbart that the threats had the effect of \u201cmaking me and everyone around me more determined to win on Tuesday. \u201d As for last Wednesday\u2019s shooting attack on Republican congressmen in Alexandria, Virginia, she said that she and her campaign had refused to politicize it. \u201cNo one from my camp is going to be making anything political for that. \u201d She concluded: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to go well for me and for Republicans. We will show the country, and all the eyes on the district, that Nancy Pelosi is not going to come into the district and steal the seat out from under us. \u201d Election Day is tomorrow, June 20, and both parties seem to expect a close result.
