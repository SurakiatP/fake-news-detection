And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they will continue to likely an indictment. \u201d \\nI said sources described an \u201cavalanche of evidence\u201d in case & barring obstruction they\u2019d likely continue 2 push to try for an indictment\u201d https://t.co/2TjzxdJod1 \\n\u2014 Bret Baier (@BretBaier) November 2, 2016 \\nThe news was cited by various traders as the catalyst that pressured the USD when it come out late on Wednesday. \\n\u201cThere is an avalanche of new information coming in every day,\u201d one source told Fox News, who added some of the new information is coming from the WikiLeaks documents and new emails. He added that FBI agents are \u201cactively and aggressively pursuing this case,\u201d and will be going back and interviewing the same people again, some for the third time, sources said. Agents are also going through what Clinton and top aides have said in previous interviews and the FBI 302, documents agents use to report interviews they conduct, to make sure notes line up, according to sources. \\nHere are the key highlights from his report, as summarized by Real Clear Politics: The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret server on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is \u201clikely\u201d in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, \u201cbarring some obstruction in some way\u201d from the Justice Department. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton\u2019s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it. A transcript of his statement: BRET BAIER: Breaking news tonight \u2014 two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations into the Clinton emails and the Clinton Foundation tell Fox the following: The investigation looking into possible pay-for-play interaction between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Foundation has been going on for more than a year. Led by the white collar crime division, public corruption branch of the criminal investigative division of the FBI. The Clinton Foundation investigation is a, quote, \u201cvery high priority.\u201d Agents have interviewed and reinterviewed multiple people about the Foundation case, and even before the WikiLeaks dumps, agents say they have collected a great deal of evidence. Pressed on that, one sources said, quote, \u201ca lot of it,\u201d and \u201cthere is an avalanche of new information coming every day.\u201d Some of it from WikiLeaks, some of it from new emails. The agents are actively and aggressively pursuing this case. They will be going back to interview the same people again, some for the third time. As a result of the limited immunity deals to top aides, including Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, the Justice Department had tentatively agreed that the FBI would destroy those laptops after a narrow review. We are told definitively that has not happened. Those devices are currently in the FBI field office here in Washington, D.C. and are being exploited. The source points out that any immunity deal is null and void if any subject lied at any point in the investigation. Meantime, the classified e-mail investigation is being run by the National Security division of the FBI. They are currently combing through former Democratic Congressman Anthony Wiener\u2019s laptop and have found e-mails that they believe came from Hillary Clinton\u2019s server that appear to be new, as in not duplicates. Whether they contain classified material or not is not yet known. It will likely be known soon. All of this just as we move inside one week until election day. \\nBaier gave more details to Fox News Channel\u2019s Brit Hume: \\nBRET BAIER: Here\u2019s the deal: We talked to two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations. One: The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far\u2026 Several offices separately have been doing their own investigations. \\nTwo: The immunity deal that Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, two top aides to Hillary Clinton, got from the Justice Department in which it was beleived that the laptops they had, after a narrow review for classified materials, were going to be destroyed. We have been told that those have not been destroyed \u2014 they are at the FBI field office here on Washington and are being exploited. . \\nThree: The Clinton Foundation investigation is so expansive, they have interviewed and re-interviewed many people. They described the evidence they have as \u2018a lot of it\u2019 and said there is an \u2018avalanche coming in every day.\u2019 WikiLeaks and the new emails. \\nThey are \u201cactively and aggressively pursuing this case.\u201d Remember the Foundation case is about accusations of pay-for-play\u2026 They are taking the new information and some of them are going back to interview people for the third time. As opposed to what has been written about the Clinton Foundation investigation, it is expansive. \\nThe classified e-mail investigation is being run by the National Security division of the FBI. They are currently combing through Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. They are having some success \u2014 finding what they believe to be new emaisls, not duplicates, that have been transported through Hillary Clinton\u2019s server. \\nFinally, we learned there is a confidence from these sources that her server had been hacked. And that it was a 99% accuracy that it had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that things had been taken from that\u2026 \\nThere has been some angst about Attorney General Loretta Lynch \u2014 what she has done or not done. She obviously did not impanel, or go to a grand jury at the beginning . They also have a problem, these sources do, with what President Obama said today and back in October of 2015\u2026 \\n\\nI pressed again and again on this very issue\u2026 The investigations will continue, there is a lot of evidence. And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they will continue to likely an indictment. \\nWill the FBI stun the world and announce yet another probe is being opened into the Clinton foundation, or will the DOJ successfully stifle this and at least push it until after the elections? As we concluded last night, the last few days before the election are shaping up as very interesting. \\nThis article originally appeared on Zero Hedge.
