HBO announced on Monday that the seventh season of the series will be seven episodes long  \u2014   a departure from the   schedule of each of the previous six seasons. Additionally, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d will debut in the summer of 2017, as opposed to its traditional start time in the spring. (Previous seasons had started in March or April.) The network explained a later shooting schedule would help the season\u2019s plot.\u2019 \u201d\u201cNow that winter has arrived on \u2019Game of Thrones,\u2019 executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss felt that the story lines of the next season would be better served by starting production a little later than usual, when the weather is changing,\u201d HBO\u2019s president of programming, Casey Bloys, said in a statement.\u201d \u2019The new schedule could present a significant opportunity for HBO\u2019s competitors: If the seventh season begins later than May, it will not be eligible for next year\u2019s Emmy Awards. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has garnered the most Emmy nominations of any TV show for three consecutive years, and last year it took home the Emmy for best drama for the first time. Mr. Benioff and Mr. Weiss had said last month they envisioned two more seasons to close out the series, amounting to about 13 episodes. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has never been more popular: Last month\u2019s Season 6 finale had the highest ratings ever for the show.'"}, "time": 1742562690.3260589}
