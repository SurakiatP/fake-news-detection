[\u201cForeign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Thursday that tensions in the strategically vital waterway have lessened and countries from outside the region should support efforts toward stability,\u201d the AP reports.  Kang was speaking in response to Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson\u2019s assertion that the U. S. should send a \u201cclear signal\u201d to China about halting its military buildup on South China Sea islands. The New York Times worries that Tillerson\u2019s remarks could \u201cforeshadow\u201d a foreign policy crisis with China: Mr. Tillerson told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that China\u2019s     campaign in the    rich sea was illegal and \u201cakin to Russia\u2019s taking of Crimea. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the   stops,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told the senators. \u201cAnd second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed. \u201d Should those words be translated into action after Donald J. Trump assumes the presidency on Jan. 20, it would be a remarkable change in the American approach to Beijing\u2019s   in the South China Sea, which is transforming the area into what one Washington think tank said would by 2030 become \u201cvirtually a Chinese lake. \u201d China asserts sovereignty over most of the South China Sea despite competing claims by countries including Vietnam and the Philippines and an international ruling rejecting most of Beijing\u2019s assertions. The Secretary of State nominee explained his focus on the South China Sea, as related by Reuters: Tillerson said he considered China\u2019s South China Sea activity \u201cextremely worrisome\u201d and that it would be a threat to the \u201centire global economy\u201d if Beijing were able to dictate access to the waterway. He blamed the current situation on what he termed an inadequate U. S. response. \u201cThe failure of a response has allowed them just to keep pushing the envelope on this,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cThe way we\u2019ve got to deal with this is we\u2019ve got to show back up in the region with our traditional allies in Southeast Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking territory or control, or declaring control of territories that are not rightfully China\u2019s,\u201d he added, stressing that China\u2019s   and declaration of an air defense zone in contested waters are \u201cillegal actions. \u201d If Tillerson is serious about denying China access to the islands, it certainly would be a dramatic change from the Obama policy of \u201cchallenging\u201d China\u2019s \u201cexcessive maritime claims\u201d without doing anything to actually slow them down. The Times reports Tillerson\u2019s remarks generated \u201creactions including confusion, disbelief, and warlike threats from analysts in China,\u201d quoting one such analyst boasting that China now has greater   capability than the United States, and would be ready for any \u201ctroubles\u201d sent its way. Just about every Western media report on Tillerson\u2019s statement focuses on the ominous ambiguity of what he meant by denying China \u201caccess\u201d to South China Sea islands  \u2014   many of which, as Reuters points out, are \u201cequipped with   airstrips and fortified with weapons. \u201d \u201cThis is the sort of    remark akin to a tweet that pours fuel on the fire and maybe makes things worse. Short of going to war with China, there is nothing the Americans can do,\u201d senior analyst Malcolm Davis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute told Bloomberg News. However, Bloomberg notes that for all the concern about an enraged Chinese response, and a bit of snarling from analysts like those cited and alluded to by the New York Times, the actual official response from Beijing has been \u201crelatively measured\u201d so far  \u2014   consisting mostly of officials like the Foreign Ministry\u2019s Lu Kang saying they aren\u2019t quite certain what Tillerson meant.'"}, "time": 1742561661.2780874}
