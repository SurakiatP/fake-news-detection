To look at the polls, you\u2019d wonder if there is a single Black person in the entire country who is willing to give him the time of the day. They do show up, of course. Sure, sometimes they turn out to be ex-cult members turned jazz singing GOP fanatics . Sure, sometimes they are faded celebrities who accidentally use the \u2018N\u2019 word on stage. But you know, sometimes it\u2019s a Marine or Navy serviceman who has somehow managed to look past the debase insults , juvenile tantrums , and transparent lies of the GOP\u2019s great orange hope. \\nIt\u2019s such a damn shame that Trump can\u2019t tell one group from another. They All Look The Same To Trump \\nHis recent attempts at rebooting his campaign\u2019s standing with Black people was something of a fiasco . It failed in part because it\u2019s way too late for Trump to distance himself from close ties to White supremacy and antisemitism . \\nBut it also failed because his image of the lives of Black people is that it is one of nasty, brutish, Dickensian squalor. Indeed, it\u2019s so out of touch-offensive that even his plans to help struggling Black communities come across as being unforgivably racist. \\nIt\u2019s little wonder, then, that when Trump saw a black face at his rally in Kinston, North Carolina, his razor-sharp mind kicked in. He jumped to the kind of conclusion you\u2019d expect from a man with less racial sensitivity than a 19th century British naval officer. \\nHe assumed the man was a protester. Different Strokes Of The Pen \\nSixty-three-year-old ex-Marine C.J. Cary was on a mission. Though a die-hard Republican, he had been deeply shocked by some of the things Trump has said. In an effort to reason with him, he penned a letter that, according to the Charlette Observer : \u201c\u2026 [Urged] Trump to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups: black people, women, people with disabilities and college students.\u201d \\nHe never got to deliver the note. \\nHe made his way toward the front rows shouting \u201cDonald\u201d and waving his document, trying to attract the nominees attention. It worked. Sort of. \u201cWe have a protester!\u201d Trump told the crowd, adding : \u201cBy the way,were you paid $1,500 to be a thug?\u201d Trump calls black supporter a \"thug,\" has him kicked out of a rally in North Carolina. https://t.co/b4gkI6qx9v pic.twitter.com/eJKuu0CLRi \\n\u2014 Jason Sparks (@sparksjls) October 28, 2016 \\nAs the long time Republican voter was escorted from the venue he made one final attempt to get his note to the man who would be king : \u201cI said, \u2018I was trying to get to this doc to Mr. Donald \u2026 will you get this to Donald?\u2019\u201d \\nThe official promised he would pass along the note. Having been treated to some common courtesy at last, Cary set off back home to watch the election coverage with that same horrified expression that we\u2019ve all become so accustomed to. \\nBy the way, this wasn\u2019t the first time a Trump supporter has been mistaken for a protester simply because he wasn\u2019t the right color: \\nFeatured Image via Twitter About Grownmangrumbles \\nI\\'m a full- time, somewhat unwilling resident of the planet Earth.
