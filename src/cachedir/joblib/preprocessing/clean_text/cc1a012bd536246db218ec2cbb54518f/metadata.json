Today\u2019s topic, we try to tell the difference between another two often-confused terms: charting and sharting. Let\u2019s go! \\nCharting refers to the process by which health care providers replace face-to-face time with face-to-chart time. If you did something, it needs to be charted . If you saw a patient, write a progress note . If you gave a patient a sandwich , write a sandwich note . \\nOn the other hand, sharting refers to the process by which health care providers replace their underwear and pants because they shat themselves when they thought they were just farting . Or charting for that matter. \\nCharting , though painful because it consumes over 99% of the entire workday, is never embarrassing, so in that respect it\u2019s a good thing. This is different from sharting , which is never painful but always embarrassing. Especially if wearing white pants. \\nFirst priority when sharting is to survey the surroundings: is anyone around? If the coast is clear, the second priority is to assess the damage: tire tracks or swamp? In this respect, charting is not as stressful as sharting . \\nWhen you\u2019re charting , all you can think about until you finish writing notes is, \u201cWow, this really sucks.\u201d When you\u2019re sharting , all you can think about until you change clothes is, \u201cWow, this really smells\u201d and \u201cDarn it, it\u2019s going down my leg!\u201d Whereas charting makes one pooped, sharting is pooping. \\nWhen someone sees you charting , they sympathize , maybe even empathize : \u201cGee, I hope that she finishes charting soon.\u201d When someone sees you sharting , they laugh and point and tell others: \u201cHAHAHAHAHA!! WHAT A LOSER!! ONLY LOSERS SHART!\u201d It\u2019s true: only losers shart. \\nSometimes when you\u2019re charting you make a mistake, but it\u2019s easy to addend or even mark in error and start a new note. Not with sharting . Sharting in and of itself is a mistake, a huge mistake, and way harder to erase the evidence of it. In fact, you need to discard your clothes immediately. But can you get to new clothing before someone spots you? For that reason, sharting is always worse than charting . \\nNow, do you know the difference between\u2026 '"}, "time": 1742628488.0953999}
