But lately, novel technologies, including   services like Uber and advances in   cars, are creating new alternatives for commuting, shuttling children and going to the store  \u2014   particularly in urban settings. There are also demographic and economic trends in play. Many younger Americans do not consider owning a car a goal or necessity  \u2014   or a necessary expense. So carmakers are looking ahead to a day when the automobile plays a smaller role, or even no role at all, in many people\u2019s daily routines. \u201cThe historical model is you buy a car and it\u2019s in your garage most of the time,\u201d said Glen DeVos, vice president for engineering and services at Delphi Automotive, a big developer and supplier of automobile technology. \u201cIt\u2019s the   expensive thing you buy after your home, so if you can get around without owning a car, there are a lot of economic reasons people may not own a car, or own only one instead of two. \u201d One clear sign of the shift is the increasing energy that carmakers are devoting to a design category the auto industry refers to as the \u201cthe first   mile\u201d challenge. It refers to the short distances some people must travel from home or work to a local destination, often a mass transit station. Not so long ago, this challenge was strictly a matter for transportation authorities, and barely registered with automakers. \u201cPeople really didn\u2019t think of the first   mile issue because the car was the primary way to get around,\u2019\u2019 said Erica Klampfl, the global future mobility manager at Ford Motor Company. \u201cYou just drove your car to your destination. \u2019\u2019 In many ways, the industry\u2019s race to solve the   challenge involves the development of   vehicles, an effort involving various carmakers, technology companies and   firms. General Motors and its partner, Lyft, an Uber rival, are about to begin testing a fleet of   cars ferrying passengers short distances in Detroit and other cities. Uber already has similar trials underway in Pittsburgh and has just expanded its tests to San Francisco. Next year, Delphi Automotive expects to have   Audis providing rides to mass transit stations in a section of Singapore. Ford, meanwhile, has vowed to begin producing a   car, with no steering wheel and no pedals, by 2021. The vehicle would be intended for   services in large cities. If these types of cars and services proliferate, Mr. DeVos at Delphi said, people will have more freedom to not own automobiles. Monica Manjarres, a    college student, is embracing that freedom. She lives in Azusa, Calif. 24 miles east of Los Angeles. In the last year, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has opened miles of new light rail extensions to its subway system, including a light rail link to Azusa. \u201cIf I want to visit my sister in Pasadena, I can walk to the train and it\u2019s a   to   ride,\u201d Ms. Manjarres said. \u201cIf you drive, the traffic is usually horrible. \u201d After she graduates this semester from Azusa Pacific University with a degree in exercise science, Ms. Manjarres says, she hopes to find a job she can reach by train. \u201cI can confidently say I don\u2019t really need a car,\u201d she said. Kelly Skow has all but come to the same conclusion. A    video producer, Ms. Skow lives in Hollywood and commutes on the Los Angeles subway using the new Expo rail extension that goes to Santa Monica, where her office is. She usually covers the first and last mile of the trip on foot. \u201cI only drive maybe once a week, usually to go shopping on weekends,\u201d she said. During the week, her boyfriend uses her car to get to his job. \u201cI had barely ridden the subway before the Expo Line opened, but now I\u2019m using it a lot more and it\u2019s great. Parking in L. A. is a nightmare and you don\u2019t have to deal with that. \u201d The twist in Ms. Skow\u2019s story: She works for TrueCar, a website that provides automotive pricing and information to help connect consumers with   and   dealers. Forecasters expect people in metropolitan areas to own fewer cars in the future. But they are not ready to predict a big drop in the total number of vehicles sold, which this year will total more than 17 million cars and light trucks in the United States and about 75 million globally. That is, in part, because so many people have more than a last mile to cover. Automakers are generally betting that sales of vehicles to fleet services will offset any decline in sales to individual consumers. Boston Consulting Group predicts that 44, 000 cars will be sold to   fleets in North America in 2021, more than making up for an expected net decline in consumer sales of about 8, 000 vehicles. The bigger impact might be on how the automotive industry  \u2014   not just carmakers, but also fleet service operators, parts makers and the like  \u2014   makes its money in years to come. According to the consulting firm PwC, the global automotive industry generates about $400 billion a year in profits about 41 percent of that  \u2014   or about $164 billion  \u2014   comes from new vehicle sales. By 2030, PwC forecasts that even as overall automotive profits grow to about $600 billion, only about 29 percent of that will come from new vehicle sales. By then, PwC predicts that \u201cmobility services\u2019\u2019  \u2014   including   and other types of   transportation services  \u2014   will represent 20 percent of the automotive industry\u2019s profits. Ford is among the automakers angling to be in position if that shift occurs. \u201cWe are on the cusp of a revolution,\u201d Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief executive, said at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. Cars, he said, \u201care no longer our entire game. \u201d The company sees mobility services as potentially more profitable than its traditional business of making and selling cars. Manufacturing vehicles requires billions of dollars in investments in plants and engineering  \u2014   costs that are often difficult to recoup. Mobility services would require less upfront investment, Robert Shanks, Ford\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview. \u201cMargins could be more like 20 percent instead of the 8 percent we are trying to get to today,\u201d he said. Some of Ford\u2019s mobility efforts don\u2019t involve cars at all. Ford is sponsoring a   program in the San Francisco area, with the goal of having 7, 000 blue,   bikes in operation by 2018. In recent months, the company has also begun demonstrating a motorized conveyance device, created by its engineers, to help people cover the last mile  \u2014   especially if they are carrying luggage or groceries that would make walking a challenge. Called the   it looks like a giant white hockey puck. The passenger stands on it as it travels to her destination, or she can set a parcel on it and have the   follow along. Ford has no plans to put it into production, but the company says it represents the unconventional ways it is thinking about the transportation future. Glimpses of a less   future, and the emergence of new   options, are evident in Southern California, where the new rail system has given many more people easy access to mass transit. Ms. Skow and other residents of Santa Monica, population 92, 000, can now hop on the Expo Line and ride all the way from the coast to downtown Los Angeles, 16 miles to the east. Although Ms. Skow walks to the train, the Santa Monica municipal government has tried to make it easier to reach any of the city\u2019s three Expo Line stops without using a car. Its bus network was completely reorganized to deliver passengers to the stations in time to catch trains. For   service, after buses stop running, riders can get discounted cab rides. The last mile is more of a challenge in Azusa, a city of about 48, 000 that is less compact and walkable than Santa Monica and does not have as big a bus network. Ms. Manjarres, the college student, lives only a short walk from a station. But so many commuters still drive their cars to the train that the city doesn\u2019t have enough parking for them. Theirs is more than a   gap to bridge. \u201cPeople coming to the train will park in residential neighborhoods or retail parking lots,\u201d said Troy Butzlaff, Azusa\u2019s city manager. That is why the city is building an     solution: a   parking garage.'"}, "time": 1742564284.3260593}
