[First, Philadelphia Phillies broadcaster Mike Schmidt said that Philadelphia\u2019s Odubel Herrera\u2019s \u201clanguage barrier\u201d prevented him from becoming a player that the Phillies could build around. Then, Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy got in on the act.  During the middle innings of Tuesday night\u2019s game between the Yankees and the Red Sox, Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka had a meeting on the mound with Yankees pitching coach Larry Rothschild, and Tanaka\u2019s translator. Tanaka, who hails from Japan, needs the translator because he doesn\u2019t speak English. Shortly after Tanaka\u2019s translator walked off the mound, Remy   on the subject of foreign players using translators. Remy said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that should be legal. I really don\u2019t. \u201d \u201cWhat is it you don\u2019t like about that?\u201d asked Red Sox    announcer Dave O\u2019Brien. \u201cLearn baseball language,\u201d Remy said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. You break it down pretty easy between pitching coach and pitcher after a long period of time. \u201d It\u2019s unknown if Remy made these comments because of Schmidt\u2019s earlier remarks. It\u2019s impossible to imagine that Remy wasn\u2019t aware of them. Either way, this seems like a perfectly stupid thing to say. Who cares whether or not the guy uses a translator? \u201cLearn baseball language?\u201d If signs, and a couple carefully selected words were all that was needed to communicate with a pitcher, then managers and pitching coaches would never go to the mound, and would just give signals from the dugout. By definition, if the team ventures out to the mound, unless they\u2019re just stalling for time, it means something needed to be said which required actual conversation. If the player and the coach don\u2019t speak the same language, that\u2019s a problem. Masahiro Tanaka isn\u2019t some refugee, or illegal alien attempting to make America become more like Japan. He\u2019s a baseball player, being paid $155 million dollars to win baseball games. Something he hasn\u2019t done a whole lot of this year. That\u2019s a bigger problem. One obvious enough that it doesn\u2019t require a translator. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn'"}, "time": 1742561733.5553257}
