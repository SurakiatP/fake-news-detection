The top United Nations official in Haiti, Mourad Wahba, described the storm as \u201cthe largest humanitarian event\u201d in the country of 11 million since a devastating earthquake six years ago, with thousands scrambling for shelter. Haiti\u2019s civil protection agency said a bridge collapse severed the main highway connecting the south with    the capital. Initial reports from the government said that five people had been killed, 10 people had been injured and one person was missing. Interior Minister Fran\u00e7ois Anick Joseph said Tuesday night that 14, 530 people had been evacuated and that about 2, 200 homes were flooded or destroyed. As of Wednesday morning, the storm, which was downgraded to Category 3, from Category 4, had passed through Cuba, and the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned that a dangerous surge was beginning to spread over the Bahamas, to the north. A hurricane warning was in effect for Haiti, parts of the Bahamas and of Cuba, and a coastal stretch of Florida that includes Boca Raton, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, as well as Lake Okeechobee. As the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia braced for wind and rain, officials in the Caribbean took stock of the destruction. Georges Dubuche, the former director general of Haiti\u2019s Ministry of Health who serves on an advisory board for Direct Relief, an aid organization, said on Tuesday that he feared that there would be \u201cmaybe hundreds of dead. \u201d Mr. Joseph acknowledged that the scope of the destruction was not yet clear and that the government was still assessing the damage. The storm threw into doubt the   plans for presidential elections scheduled for Sunday. Officials were expected to announce a decision on Wednesday, with many experts saying it would be nearly impossible to conduct voting with crucial infrastructure crippled or destroyed. \u201cI have a suspicion they will hold it in two weeks,\u201d said Leslie Voltaire, the campaign manager for one of the candidates, Maryse Narcisse. \u201cBut it is only a suspicion. \u201d The storm was still a Category 4 when it made landfall around 7 a. m. Tuesday at Les Anglais, on the southwestern tip of Haiti, the western half of the island of Hispaniola. Frantic residents in the south said by phone that they were coping with major devastation as the storm felled trees, ripped roofs and destroyed farms in what already was a struggling area in the Western Hemisphere\u2019s poorest country. \u201cThank God our neighbors came to save us,\u201d said Daphne Thelma, a resident of Les Cayes, one of the   towns on the southern coast. \u201cWe lost all our crops, and have nothing left. \u201d She said her family of eight, four of them children, had been rescued by neighbors as trees crashed into their home. The family split up to ride out the storm in different houses. Adassa Romilus, a spokeswoman for Heifer International, a charity that works with 30, 000 farming families in Haiti, said many livestock placed in shelters for protection had been killed. \u201cThe shelters couldn\u2019t withstand the force of the hurricane,\u201d she said. Officials reported that roughly 400 homes had been destroyed. In the town of Kay Coq on the remote island of    a fishing community of 2, 000 people about six miles off the coast of Les Cayes, the hurricane left a scene of chaos. \u201cRight now there is no more Kay Coq,\u201d said Carobert Altema, 58, a fisherman. \u201cHouses are down, people are screaming. We have no updates about which people are missing. \u201d Mr. Altema said household belongings had been washed out to sea. \u201cAt my age, this is the first time I have experienced something like this,\u201d he said. Aid organizations in Haiti said rescue efforts were focused on evacuating people from houses threatened with collapse. \u201cPeople have been leaving their homes under the full force of the storm to find shelters,\u201d said   Fignole, a program manager in Haiti for Oxfam, the international charity. Mr. Fignole said the storm had hit Haiti just as farmers in the south were about to harvest plantains, a staple in their subsistence diet. \u201cThere will be real hunger in the weeks ahead,\u201d he said. Other charitable groups doing work in Haiti also expressed alarm about the storm\u2019s effect on food production in the country, which has been struggling to recover from a prolonged drought. John Hasse, national director for World Vision Haiti, said that the storm destroyed avocado trees and that at least two communities had lost their entire banana crops. \u201cWe have gotten good rain this year. We were starting to see progress in malnutrition,\u201d he said, because families were able to prepare healthier food for their children. \u201cWe think this is going to destroy a lot of it. \u201d The National Hurricane Center had projected 15 to 25 inches of rain for southern Haiti and in the southwestern part of the Dominican Republic, warning that as much as 40 inches of rain might fall in some areas. Some streets in    flooded, and public transit was paralyzed. But by late afternoon, the storm appeared to have spared    the worst of its wrath. Moderate rain was falling, residents reported, with no sign of the catastrophic flooding that was affecting areas farther south. Although the sea level rose at the edge of Cit\u00e9 Soleil, the city\u2019s harbor slum, the water did not breach the central wharf. Residents in the most vulnerable part of the slum, a   shantytown called Deye Chabon, piled logs and garbage into barricades that kept the water from spilling into the narrow streets. Nonetheless, residents of Deye Chabon were keeping a wary eye on the sea. \u201cThey say if it keeps rising, they will have to go find another place to be,\u201d said Sherby St. Louis, 16, a student. Melanie Jean Pierre, 32, a street vendor, said she was riding out the storm in    with her children. She said the only damage had come from a leak in the roof that soaked her bed. More than four million children may be threatened by the hurricane, Unicef warned on Tuesday. \u201cWaterborne diseases are the first threat to children in similar situations,\u201d Marc Vincent, the Unicef representative in Haiti, said. \u201cOur first priority is to make sure children have enough safe water. \u201d Jessica Pearl, the Haiti country director for the Mercy Corps charity, who lives in    said a main concern in   areas would be providing drinking water, which she described as \u201ca problem in normal times. \u201d Haiti still is recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake, with 55, 000 people living in shelters. A cholera epidemic that followed the earthquake has persisted, and it spiked in 2016. Partners in Health, an aid agency that has long worked in Haiti, says there have been 26, 000 cholera cases this year. The hurricane \u201chas the potential to be a big setback for years of efforts to bring cholera under control,\u201d Ms. Pearl said. \u201cThe people here have just been pushed down by one thing after another. \u201d The hurricane center had warned that the combination of a dangerous storm surge and large and destructive waves could raise water levels by seven to 11 feet above normal tide levels on the southern coast of Cuba seven to 10 feet on the southern coast of Haiti four to six feet on the northern coast of Cuba and four to six feet in Jamaica. Officials in the United States were preparing for one of the most powerful hurricanes to threaten the East Coast. The governors of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina declared emergencies while meteorologists refined their forecasts and suggested that the storm could lash the shoreline into the weekend. More than 2, 000 National Guard soldiers were activated across the South, and the authorities planned lane reversals, school closures and sandbag distribution sites. In Florida, where hurricane and tropical storm watches were in effect for part of the coast, officials were considering evacuations. \u201cThe problem we have with this storm is that the projected path is right along our coast,\u201d Gov. Rick Scott said on Tuesday during a stop in the Florida Keys. \u201cIf it turns, we\u2019re not going to have a lot of time to make a decision. The best thing is to be prepared and not to take any chances. \u201d Mr. Scott warned that the storm could prove \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d and officials worried about extended power failures, widespread flooding and a lack of preparation along the heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor. Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who said officials expected Matthew to strike the state as a Category 2 or 3 hurricane, deferred a decision on a coastal evacuation until Wednesday. \u201cI would love nothing more than to see this just suddenly take a   turn and go out to sea,\u201d said Ms. Haley, who told about one million residents to prepare to leave the coast as soon as Wednesday afternoon.'"}, "time": 1742628588.2969525}
