Sputnik Poland discussed the issue with Polish politician and commentator Mariusz Olszewski. \\n\u201c Macierewicz is a very efficient politician and defense minister and his ability to place [the territorial defense force] under his personal command, rather that the president\u2019s is nothing short of a political masterpiece, \u201d Mariusz Olszewski told Sputnik Poland. \\nHe added that the new force was obviously meant for use inside the country against the so-called \u201cdeath squads\u201d trying to destabilize the political situation in the country. \\n\u201cIf this is really what is happening, then the government\u2019s fears are fully justified,\u201d Olszewski chuckled. \\nIn the event of an armed conflict the territorial defense units will be called up to secure their designated areas, stamp out attempts to stoke up ethnic and religious conflicts and attempts to destabilize the country. \\nWhen asked whether it means that the Territorial Defense Force (TDF) would serve as a kind of \u201cpersonal police\u201d for the ruling Law and Justice party, Mariusz Olszewski said that it would rather serve the national security minister. \\n\u201cThe very list of threats the TDF is supposed to deal with looks a bit strange though as we have no internal threats, neither have we any regional or ethnic minorities here,\u201d Olszewski said, adding that the real threat to the powers-that-be came from people who \u201cuse Western money to destabilize the country through media \u2018death squads\u2019 and challenge the constitutional order in Poland.\u201d \\n\u201cI am also worried by Ukrainian media saying that it could take the Polish army just five days to reach the border of the Second Polish Republic [prior to 1939 \u2014 Ed.]. This is exactly the kind of misinformation Western propaganda was spreading about Russian troops needing just 24 hours to reach Warsaw. Someone is trying to pit Eastern European countries against each other, to make people believe that war is imminent,\u201d Mariusz Olszewski warned. \\nWhile admitting that security was something no country should ignore, he added that a country the size of Poland might need a territorial defense force, but only as a backup to the regular forces, \u201cnot as the mainstay of national defense as our defense ministry wants us to believe. This is either someone\u2019s mistake or just a PR stunt.\u201d \\n\u201cPoland needs ground forces, an Air Force and, to a lesser extent, a Navy. As for territorial defense, it is just a smokescreen meant to hide what is really happening in our army,\u201d Mariusz Olszewski emphasized . \\nThe Territorial Defense Force (TDF) is a planned military reserve component of the Polish armed forces which is currently being formed. \\nPlans call for the force, once fully active, to consist of 35,000 part-time volunteers. Poland plans to deploy the new territorial defense units on its eastern border and to transfer the acting brigades there with an eye to becoming one of the largest NATO armies in Europe. \\nDefense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said that the deployment was aimed against Russia, describing it as a \"measured, proportionate\" response to \"the prospect of aggressive Russian action.\" \\nHe also supports the idea of significantly boosting the Polish armed forces, from the current 80,000 servicemen to some 150,000.
