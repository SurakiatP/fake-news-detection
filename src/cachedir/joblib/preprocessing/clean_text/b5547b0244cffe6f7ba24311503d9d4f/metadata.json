If you ask any meat eater to describe what it was like to be carnivorous in the \u201990s, don\u2019t be surprised if they reply with their best imitation of this iconic sizzle. 2. This. Sound. The original \u201990s sizzle. The good ol\u2019 days when this could be heard across every American grill. While it held enough broad appeal for child meat eaters to enjoy, it always had something a little naughty just for the parents to understand. No smartphones necessary to appreciate this classic griddle noise. 3. Meat eaters in the \u201990s went wild when in the now-classic episode of Friends \u201cThe One Where Joey Ruins Labor Day,\u201d Joey and Chandler fired up the grill, threw on some burgers and then\u2026well, if you haven\u2019t seen the episode, you won\u2019t get it. 4. Keen listeners will know this one is straight from the summer of \u201995, from the Johnson family\u2019s burger barbecue in Orlando, FL. 5. If you\u2019ve never woken up with this sound stuck in your head, it\u2019s because you either weren\u2019t around in the \u201990s, weren\u2019t eating meat then, or both. 6. The \u201970s were all about hissing, and the \u201980s featured their fair share of crackling. But when it came to the \u201990s, sizzling was king, and no sizzling noise was more recognizable to meat eaters than this one. And we miss it every day.'"}, "time": 1742561761.2010257}
