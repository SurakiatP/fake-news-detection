Caught in the gap between his soaring rhetoric as an outsider candidate and the realities of leading a city with a   sensitivity to crime, Mr. de Blasio is disappointing many who once supported him, in a community he can ill afford to lose: the black voters who propelled him to office. \u201cAll I know is, in all our circles, folks have conversations and there\u2019s a buzz going around about the disappointment,\u201d said Bertha Lewis, the former leader of Acorn who served on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s transition team in 2014, but has become a vocal critic. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing enthusiasm gap. \u201d Throughout the mayor\u2019s term, there have been opportunities for him to live up to his image and his promise as a   police reformer. Instead, those issues have become magnets for dissent. Tens of thousands in extra pay for Daniel Pantaleo, the Staten Island officer who put Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold in 2014. Disciplinary records newly shielded from disclosure. Resistance to   legislation in the City Council. Continuing fidelity to a \u201c \u201d model of policing. Frustration can be heard at New York Communities for Change, a social justice advocacy group and early endorser of Mr. de Blasio in the 2013 Democratic primary, and from a former aide, Kirsten John Foy, whose handcuffing at a Brooklyn parade in 2011 helped galvanize Mr. de Blasio\u2019s views on the need for changes in police practices. Last month, Mr. Foy stood alongside Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat and a possible challenger to Mr. de Blasio in 2017, at a protest outside Police Headquarters. At the Council, a growing number of members have been refusing to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of meetings, in part, they say, because of the administration\u2019s handling of policing issues. Councilman Jumaane D. Williams, who was detained along with Mr. Foy in 2011, began the effort, saying his decision to offer the silent protest came after he learned that Officer Pantaleo accrued overtime pay while on modified duty. \u201cThat\u2019s what brought me over the edge,\u201d said Mr. Williams, a Democrat from Brooklyn. \u201cI had to do something. \u201d On the other side, members of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association have orchestrated protests outside the mayoral residence at Gracie Mansion, and by the Prospect Park Y. M. C. A. where Mr. de Blasio regularly works out. In their view, he has already gone too far. Mr. de Blasio, seemingly cognizant of his potential vulnerability, has responded in recent weeks. After the city\u2019s    police tactics became an issue in the first presidential debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton, the mayor seized the opportunity to emphasize his opposition to the overuse of the tactics during the administration of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, doing so on national television and local radio. On Friday, he said that he would press for changes to state law to allow greater transparency with police disciplinary records, a pledge that garnered a lukewarm response from reform advocates. The mayor moved swiftly last month to restrict overtime pay to officers on modified duty  \u2014   like Officer Pantaleo  \u2014   then headed to Harlem to bring his message to a gathering at the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network. In the speech, the mayor outlined his administration\u2019s efforts to improve relations between the police and minority communities  \u2014   fewer arrests retraining of officers on the use of force a commitment to reinventing community policing  \u2014   while embracing demands for more in the future. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way things change,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cKeep those demands coming. Keep the pressure on. \u201d Mr. de Blasio has not yet announced new police reform initiatives. Phil Walzak, a top mayoral aide, said the mayor would do so during his campaign, but he declined to characterize them. \u201cI don\u2019t think at any point is anyone saying, \u2018All done here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Walzak said. \u201cThere\u2019s more to do. But this mayor is absolutely committed to real reform. He\u2019s put real reforms in place, and there\u2019s more to come. \u201d Mr. de Blasio is also facing    pressure to embrace a distant and difficult goal: the closing of the Rikers Island jail complex. His campaign has stuck to a simple message when it comes to the police: Crime is down, even with far fewer of the   arrests and police stops that fall heavily on black and Hispanic communities. Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the mayor\u2019s 2017 campaign, said Mr. de Blasio had \u201cproven New York City can improve   relations while remaining the safest big city in America. \u201d Mr. Levitan pointed to poll numbers showing that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s support remained high among black voters and had remained steady on questions of   relations. Indeed, Mr. Sharpton said the mayor\u2019s \u201cbasic supporters have been pretty much satisfied. \u201d Critics of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s concede that there have been changes at the Police Department during his tenure. But they lament that the reforms have been unilaterally taken and directed by the police themselves. And they focus on the apparent absence of punishment for officers, even for those involved in the   deaths of unarmed black men, like Mr. Garner and Ramarley Graham, who was fatally shot in his Bronx home in 2012. \u201cWhen your training fails you in the field, there\u2019s no accountability for that,\u201d said Councilman Robert Cornegy, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn. But, he added despairingly, the issue may not cost Mr. de Blasio at the polls because black voters are already \u201cdisaffected\u201d in their hopes for police reform. \u201cThey\u2019re disappointed,\u201d Mr. Cornegy said of his black constituents, adding: \u201cThe   community and the Caribbean communities love really hard, and, consequently, when they\u2019re done, they\u2019re done really hard. They\u2019re not at a done period. \u201d Policing presents a tightrope for any New York mayor, perhaps none more so than Mr. de Blasio, who began his administration amid the high hopes of reformers and the skeptical eye of    officers. Those tensions burst into public view starting in 2014 after street protests arose in response to a grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict Officer Pantaleo in Mr. Garner\u2019s death, followed by the killing of two patrol officers in Brooklyn and a de facto work slowdown by officers, as some turned their backs on the mayor while he spoke at the officers\u2019 funerals. Mr. de Blasio has at times presented what he hopes will be a new model of community policing in ways that are likely to appeal to    officers. \u201cThis is not social work this is crime fighting,\u201d he said recently when asked of the program, in terms oddly reminiscent of  the early administration of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Representative Jeffries said the mayor\u2019s resistance to the Council\u2019s legislating police activity, his continued support of   policing  \u2014   a tactic that involves aggressively going after minor offenses to prevent major ones  \u2014   and his embrace of a proposal to make resisting arrest a felony were \u201cnot the positions of a police reformer. \u201d \u201cThese are the positions,\u201d he continued, \u201cof someone who seems afraid to aggressively go at the police unions that defend the status quo. \u201d That feeling has been shared by some who worked in the de Blasio administration, and say they were drawn there by the promise of making deep changes to the criminal justice system. Dominique Day worked on justice initiatives at the Mayor\u2019s Office of Criminal Justice until January. She said she left disheartened at the lack of zeal for changes, such as improving the quality of the information used in the increasingly   interactions between New Yorkers and the criminal justice system. \u201cYou have this really exciting rhetoric of reform that has been embraced by almost everyone, including the police and prosecutors,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in practice, it\u2019s business as usual. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563401.4804225}
