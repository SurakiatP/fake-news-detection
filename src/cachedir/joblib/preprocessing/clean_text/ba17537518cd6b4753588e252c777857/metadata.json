[\u201cWe\u2019ll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks,\u201d Trump explained when asked about the   \u201cDREAMers\u201d in an interview with ABC News anchor David Muir.  In 2012, Obama instituted DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) allowing these children to stay in the country legally. During the campaign, Trump vowed to repeal DACA and DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) a promise that   activists are watching closely. During the ABC interview, however, Trump urged the   \u201cDREAMers\u201d not to worry. \u201cThey are here illegally. They shouldn\u2019t be very worried. I do have a big heart. We\u2019re going to take care of everybody,\u201d he said, promising to restore a strong border. \u201cWhere you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried. \u201d Trump added that his administration would focus on criminal illegal immigrants first. \u201cThose people have to be worried \u2019cause they\u2019re getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get them out. We\u2019re gonna get \u2019em out fast. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561973.2116048}
