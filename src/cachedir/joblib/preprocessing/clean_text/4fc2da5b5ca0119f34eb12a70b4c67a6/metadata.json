So if you\u2019re a comedian and you want to be successful- don\u2019t bring politics into your act! Seriously, it just kills the mood, no one will be up to laughing after you insult them over who they are supporting for President, or whether or not they view abortion as murder. \\nWho would find any humor in that? \\nThis should be common sense, but for Amy Schumer \u2026twas not. Now she\u2019s learning the hard way, what many of us were warning her about for a while now! \\nAccording to AdWeek, Budweiser came in under expected profits in their third quarter, prompting the company to pull the Schumer ads ahead of schedule. The ads themselves were not at all doing well, and the last one received such negative attention on YouTube that it currently has more than 1,900 \u201cthumbs down,\u201d compared to only 300 \u201cthumbs up.\u201d \\nFox News reported that, at one time, the YouTube video had comments disabled, but that has since been changed. Many comments are negative toward Schumer herself, who has recently been in traveling around promoting feminist ideals and social justice causes. \\nSchumer\u2019s attitude on politics has alienated many people over the past few years, however. Many would say that the comedian\u2019s negative views on men, and hypocritical outrage, is often in complete contrast with inclusivity. This could have further attributed to the decline in Bud Light\u2019s sales, as having a wildly unpopular figure represent your product will devalue it to the public. \\nSorry Schumer. Either be a comedian, or a social justice warrior\u2026the two however, do not play well together. Somewhere along the line you got that very obvious truth, twisted.
