[But former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said Trump should put his words into action, citing recent remarks by the president that he might stop the daily briefings at the White House.  \u201cWhat they ought to do is get out of all this junk, they ought to focus on the big goals, they ought to report to the nation on the big goals, ignore all these reporters, close down the press room, send the reporters off [to Starbucks],\u201d Gingrich said on Fox News\u2019s Hannity. \u201cMaybe say to the American people  \u2014   send in your questions, we\u2019ll take the best five questions and we\u2019ll answer them by name,\u201d Gingrich said, calling the press \u201cdishonest opponents\u201d of the president.

S. government,\u201d the statement from WHCA President Jeff Mason said. \u201cDoing away with briefings would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U. S. system, no political figure is above being questioned. \u201d \u201cThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association would object to any move that would threaten those   principles,\u201d said Mason, who also works as a reporter with Reuters.'"}, "time": 1742561876.4794738}
