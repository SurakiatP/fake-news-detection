C. that there are areas where he is seeking to work with the Trump Administration. [\u201cI find complexity and contradiction very congenial to my bent of mind,\u201d Brown said, in response to questions of whether he felt \u201cconflicted and torn\u201d under pressures to oppose or cooperate with the Trump administration.  Brown met with Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) Agency acting Administrator Bob Fenton on Monday, according to the Sacramento Bee which posted video of Brown\u2019s comments to reporters. Brown has estimated storm damage at over $500 million dollars. On Sunday Brown, sought a fourth federal disaster declaration from President Donald Trump according to KTLA. Brown was told in the meeting of Trump\u2019s great concern for disaster relief in California. While Brown expressed a positive response to Trump\u2019s words, he did not relent in his criticism of the administration\u2019s choice to review greenhouse gas standards, according to the report. California is still dealing with the damaged Oroville Dam spillway. Storms have brought welcome water to the   state, while at the same time further stressing critical infrastructure. Brown has continued to slam GOP and Trump administration aims, including the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. But under the pressure of the needs of California, he seemed more willing to work with the administration on Monday. Asked again about pressure to be the \u201cvoice of the resistance,\u201d Brown replied, \u201cI will pursue my own rhetorical paths. \u201d He continued: I will do so in the spirit of advancing the interest of California and recognizing that we\u2019re a part of the union and there\u2019s a lot to be, that we\u2019re not going our totally separate way. we are distinct. we have a sovereignty. we will pursue that. but we also have a commonality with other states and with the national government  \u2026     Brown said he is seeking to \u201cfind common ground\u201d and that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t rule anything out or anything in. \u201d Brown faces the heavy needs of his state as well as the left\u2019s strong calls to \u201cresist\u201d the Trump administration. As the concluded his comments to reporters Monday, Brown stated there \u201ccould be cause for alarm\u201d or for \u201csome optimism\u201d as he said, \u201c[n]othing\u2019s all that predictable in the current administration. \u201d Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana '"}, "time": 1742563890.4427238}
