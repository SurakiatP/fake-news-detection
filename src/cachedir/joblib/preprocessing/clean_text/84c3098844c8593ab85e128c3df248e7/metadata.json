An ordinary morning commute into New York City became a scene of destruction and chaos after a New Jersey Transit train sped into a station in Hoboken, N. J. smashing over a bumper block and skidding through the depot. At least one person was killed and scores were injured. The wreck, at one of the busiest hubs in the region, disrupted travel in and out of New York and raised new concerns about NJ Transit\u2019s troubled system. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton campaigned in Iowa and Donald Trump in New Hampshire. Mrs. Clinton has been noticeably absent from Ohio, ceding the state to Mr. Trump. But with a population that is nearly 80 percent white, Ohio is no longer seen as a bellwether for the national vote. Here\u2019s a look at   coverage, showing how CNN, Fox News and MSNBC replayed varying clips on trade, ISIS and other topics, leaving viewers with different impressions of those moments. _____ 3. Our   article today looks at the civil war Mr. Trump has set off within the   media, replete with   feuds, hate mail and awkward dinner parties. Echoing the battle in the Republican Party at large, establishment figures like George Will are pitted against insurgent conservatives, who relish the chance to punch at Beltway Republicans. And even some Tea Party figures find themselves on the wrong side of the wave. \u201cAt some point, the base of the party just wants to burn the house down and start over,\u201d said the influential conservative blogger above, Erick Erickson, who hired security guards after he was threatened for criticizing Mr. Trump. _____ 4. No break on your cable bill yet. Federal regulators couldn\u2019t agree on a plan to free consumers from cable box rental fees. Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F. C. C. is under pressure to pass a plan requiring cable companies to make their content available on Apple TV, Roku and other devices before the Obama administration ends. _____ 5. \u201cI led the company with courage. \u201d That was John Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, expressing a decidedly minority viewpoint before a House panel that proved just as hostile as a Senate committee last week. The company\u2019s board has revoked more than $41 million in compensation for Mr. Stumpf, for overseeing sales goals so unrealistic that thousands of workers opened unauthorized accounts to meet them. But unappeased lawmakers said he should be fired, and possibly jailed. _____ 6. Video emerged of a 2015 fatal shooting in Louisiana that upends the racial narrative of many contested confrontations with the police. The deputy marshals who opened fire, above, were not white. The man driving the S. U. V. they were chasing was. There was another, agonizing difference: The fatality victim was a    in the passenger seat, Jeremy Mardis, who was struck five times in the head and chest. _____ 7.  U. S. authorities have been turning back undocumented Haitians at the Mexican border, separating dozens of families when lagging members try to join those already admitted. \u201cI\u2019m hoping God makes miracles,\u201d said a woman who entered the U. S. and gave birth days before a policy change blocked her partner. Last week, the Obama administration ended a special concession that allowed undocumented Haitians into the U. S. established in the wake of the devastating 2010 earthquake that ravaged their country. _____ 8. Major League Baseball is sliding into the last days of the regular season, with these division champions: the astounding Chicago Cubs, the Boston Red Sox, the Washington Nationals, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Cleveland Indians and the Texas Rangers. The battle is on for   spots. The Baltimore Orioles beat the Blue Jays, eliminating the Yankees from contention, leaving the Yankees with a hollow win over the Red Sox. The Sox\u2019s David Ortiz was honored in what could be his last game in the Bronx. _____ 9.  A new biography portrays Adolf Hitler as a clownish, deceitful narcissist who took control of a powerful nation thanks to slick propaganda and a dysfunctional elite that failed to block his rise. Our reviewer writes that \u201cHitler: Ascent  \u201d offers \u201ca fascinating Shakespearean parable about how the confluence of circumstance, chance, a ruthless individual and the willful blindness of others can transform a country  \u2014   and, in Hitler\u2019s case, lead to an unimaginable nightmare for the world. \u201d _____ 10. Finally, good news: Many of the reports of creepy, menacing clowns received in six states  \u2014   Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina and Pennsylvania  \u2014   were pranks. The police have charged 12 people, including teenagers, with making false reports and other infractions. _____ Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting.  _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
