She went on Twitter and gave them a piece of her mind. Seems they saw a newspaper story that may have been interpreted as a liability. This exposure could hurt the Campaign. The whole Campaign is based on political profits and losses, not Human dignity. Erica Garner blasts Clinton campaign over discussions staffers had about her father\u2019s death in WikiLeaks emails Erica Garner, the daughter of police chokehold victim Eric Garner, ripped the Hillary Clinton campaign in a series of tweets Thursday after new campaign emails released by WikiLeaks showed how the Democratic nominee's staffers discussed the death of her father. \u201cI\u2019m troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed \u2018using\u2019 Eric Garner \u2026 Why would you want to \u2018use my dad?\u201d Garner tweeted along with a link to emails released by WikiLeaks. \u201cThese people will co opt anything to push their agenda. Police violence is not the same as gun violence. \u201cI'm vey (sic) interested to know exactly what @CoreyCiorciari meant when he said \u2018I know we have an Erica Garner problem\u2019 in the #PodestaEmails19,\u201d added Garner. \u201cI know we have Erica Garner issues but we don't want to mention Eric at all?
