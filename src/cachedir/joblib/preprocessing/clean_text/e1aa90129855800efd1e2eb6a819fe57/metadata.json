Partial transcript as follows: BEHAR: Breitbart \u2014  the website has been described as a platform for the   or some say white supremacists. How would you describe it? POLLAK: Breitbart News is a conservative website and we have a very diverse group of editors and writers. I\u2019m the orthodox Jewish former    senior   . So not exactly an accurate description. We call that fake news, a fake news description. But we are  \u2014   BEHAR: What\u2019s fake news, what I said? POLLAK: Yes. BILA: That it is white supremacists. BEHAR: No no no. That is not fake news. POLLAK: It\u2019s absolutely \u2014   BEHAR: How do you explain this headline, \u2018Bill Kristol: Republican Spoiler, Renegade Jew,\u2019 You\u2019re Jewish. POLLAK: It was written by David Horowitz, who is one of the most prominent Jewish conservatives. He was criticizing Bill Kristol for not being Jewish enough, so it was the opposite of what people described. And we have more than a dozen Jewish people working at Breitbart including the CEO, COO. We have Black writers, Hispanic, Asian, whatever, gay, whatever you can imagine. BEHAR: What do you think is the rise of   about in this country? POLLAK: I\u2019m really glad the media finally woke up to this phenomena. It started quite a long time ago, long before Donald Trump ran for president, particularly in California where I live, on college campuses, there\u2019s been a rising tide of   linked to far   criticism of Israel. It\u2019s very tough to be a Jewish student on some of these campuses nowadays. BEHAR: Mostly, it seems to me that there\u2019s a flurry of them since Trump is in. POLLAK: I think the media just woke up and noticed that this is a problem. BEHAR Really? POLLAK: And I think that I feel very proud that Donald Trump not only is one of the most   presidents that we\u2019ve ever had, but his daughter Ivanka tonight will light the Sabbath candles just like my wife will, and bring in the Sabbath. To me, that is something extraordinary in America history. BEHAR: But you know that phrase, one of my best friends is Jewish, it\u2019s meaningless really. You can still be an   and have Jewish relatives. POLLAK: I agree with you. When people say my friends are Jewish, it doesn\u2019t cut it. HOSTIN: Or I have a black friend. POLLAK: But when your   are Jewish, you have a little more credibility. HOSTIN: Let me ask you about Steve Bannon. Whoopi calls him President Bannon. He\u2019s the White House chief strategist, former executive chair of Breitbart, people have called him everything from a Nazi to a racist. He\u2019s made bigoted statements. They\u2019ve called him a white supremacist sympathizer. What\u2019s your response? How do you work for someone who has that reputation? POLLAK: None of that is true. That\u2019s more fake news and even people who  \u2014   HOSTIN: So everyone is lying? POLLAK: Yes. Steve is a fantastic guy. I worked with him for six years and he can be very tough in an argument. We used to argue all the time over any kind of policy issues. Jedediah will back me up here. You bring data and facts to the table  \u2014   BILA: A very tough guy. POLLAK: Absolutely a   person. HOSTIN: So we can\u2019t believe when he makes these bigoted statements, is he just being provocative? POLLAK: What statements are you talking about? HOSTIN: There\u2019s a laundry list. I can get you a card. BEHAR: Here\u2019s a headline from Breitbart. \u2018Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.\u2019 Do I look crazy to you? POLLAK: You see how you\u2019ve shifted the goal post now. So, it\u2019s gone from Steve Bannon says things to, \u201cOh, there was a headline. \u201d Steve Bannon has not said bigoted things. BEHAR: But he\u2019s behind these though. What are you talking about? BILA: I submitted content a long time ago to Breitbart and I know Steve and I\u2019ve often argued that you can disagree with him, and it\u2019s tough to disagree with him because he\u2019s a strong headed guy, but I don\u2019t believe him to be an   or racist. He\u2019s tough though, so if you go into battle you better be prepared. I have a question about Steve, which is that Steve is from what I know of him, he is kind of a boss. He does like to take control. He does like to be kind of in charge, and I see a lot of what\u2019s coming out from the Trump campaign now. A lot of the focus seems to be about going against the media establishment. That is Steve\u2019s main focal point. Is it safe to assume that Steve is kind of running the show? POLLAK: Well, I don\u2019t think Donald Trump takes orders from anybody, so I think Donald Trump is very much in charge. I think that Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus do get along.
