For some critics of President Trump, the vessel has become a symbol of the administration\u2019s ties with Russia. Mr. Trump himself referred to the ship at a marathon news conference on Thursday, saying that his critics probably think \u201cthe greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that\u2019s 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country\u2019s going to say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s so great.\u2019 That\u2019s not great. That\u2019s not great. \u201d A Coast Guard official on Thursday said the presence of the intelligence ship, called the Viktor Leonov, so close to American shores is not unprecedented, and is not a cause for alarm. The vessel has been traveling along the Eastern Seaboard and was spotted near the states of Connecticut, Virginia and Delaware. Capt. Andrew Tucci, who oversees Long Island Sound and coastal Connecticut, said the Coast Guard knew the Russian ship had been traveling from the Caribbean \u201cfor some time. \u201d \u201cThis vessel was transiting all up the Eastern Seaboard, and the Coast Guard and other military and federal government agencies are aware,\u201d Captain Tucci said. By the time the public learned of it on Wednesday, it had started to move in the direction of a submarine base in Groton, Conn. staying at least 30 miles offshore. Captain Tucci said that his region is traversed mostly by commercial fishing vessels and oceangoing freight ships, but that the Coast Guard had no reason to contact the Russian ship. Asked how often a foreign military ship passes off the U. S. coast, he said, \u201cA couple times a year. \u201d \u201cIt may not be a daily occurrence, but it is not unusual,\u201d he said of the appearance of the Russian vessel. \u201cThis vessel was in international waters for the entirety of a transit, so it is not a violation of American sovereignty in any way,\u201d Captain Tucci said. \u201cAnd yes, Russian vessels transit through international waters,\u201d he added, \u201cand certainly American vessels transit through international waters, and it is a legitimate and lawful activity that doesn\u2019t raise any particular concerns. \u201d United States territory extends 12 miles out to sea. While the ship was being treated publicly as little more than a maritime curiosity, its presence became entangled in the political discourse. That was especially true after  Michael T. Flynn\u2019s resignation this week as national security adviser amid a scandal over his contact with a Russian diplomat. Mr. Trump, who spent part of the news conference denouncing leaks to the press, later used the ship as an example of a national security matter that he would not discuss with journalists. \u201cSo when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I\u2019m not going to tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut hopefully, I won\u2019t have to do anything, but I\u2019m not going to tell you. \u201d Earlier in the week, some had seized on the Russian ship as a symbol. Representative Joe Courtney, a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said on Wednesday on the House floor and in a statement that the presence of the Russian \u201cspy ship\u201d about 30 miles from the Groton submarine base was one of several \u201cdestabilizing\u201d actions by Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cThis unacceptable, aggressive action, combined with the buzzing of U. S. Navy ships in the Black Sea yesterday, are clearly testing the resolve of a new administration,\u201d Mr. Courtney said in the statement on his website. \u201cWhile I have total confidence in our Navy\u2019s vigilant, responsible readiness, the White House needs to move past their seeming infatuation with Putin and treat him like the serious threat to global peace and security that he has been for the last five years. \u201d In Congress, the representative said the appearance of the ship fit into a Russian pattern of aggression, including the recent deployment of a new cruise missile that American officials say violated a landmark arms control treaty. \u201cThis administration needs to wake up and recognize that and move on to a bipartisan effort to respond to this threat,\u201d Mr. Courtney said. \u201cAnd they can do that by again disclosing all of the background regarding General Flynn\u2019s interactions with the Russian government, because it is part and parcel of all those incidents which I listed in terms of aggressive actions that are happening in real time as we are here in Washington, D. C. today. \u201d Though Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, said in a statement on Wednesday the ship did \u201cnot present a direct threat to our physical safety,\u201d he added that its appearance was troubling, however, viewed in conjunction with the stories of \u201cRussian ties and interference in the Trump administration and the recent deployment of a Russian cruise missile in apparent violation of international agreements. He added, \u201cIn my opinion, Russia is making a show of strength and pushing established boundaries and norms to gauge the reaction of a new administration in disarray. \u201d Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said that while the appearance of the Russian ship  was not \u201cwholly unprecedented,\u201d it showed the Trump administration had given Russia the green light to \u201cflex his muscles. \u201d For years, the   ship, which has equipment monitoring sonar and communications and carries defensive weaponry, has been patrolling near naval installations on the East Coast and was spotted two years ago near the Navy\u2019s Trident ballistic missile submarine base in Kings Bay, Ga. The Hartford Courant newspaper reported. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for years,\u201d said Jeff Walsh, a retired Navy senior chief, who served 22 years aboard attack submarines and who works at Electric Boat in Groton. Mr. Walsh was quoted by the newspaper as saying that the attention roused by the ship was amusing to people who understand the context. \u201cIt\u2019s going to keep going on until everyone wants to play nice. \u201d The Associated Press quoted an unnamed military official as saying the ship had made a port call in Cuba previously and was monitored off Delaware\u2019s coast. It was not immediately clear how long the Russian ship had remained off the Connecticut coast. Captain Tucci said he did not have information about the location of the Russian ship on Thursday. \u201cIt came up here, it turned around and left, and to my knowledge the last briefing I got, it was headed back down,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628446.061167}
