Silenced on the Senate floor for condemning a peer, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, emerged on Wednesday in a coveted role: the avatar of liberal resistance in the age of President Trump. Late on Tuesday, Senate Republicans voted to halt the remarks of Ms. Warren, already a lodestar of the left, after she criticized a colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, by reading a letter from Coretta Scott King. Instantly, the decision  \u2014   led by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who invoked a rarely enforced rule prohibiting senators from impugning the motives and conduct of a peer  \u2014   amplified Ms. Warren\u2019s message and further inflamed the angry Senate debate over Mr. Sessions\u2019 nomination. He was confirmed on Wednesday. For Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters, it was the latest and most visceral example of a woman muzzled by men who seemed unwilling to listen. Critics saw something else: a senator who has rankled members of both parties with her nose for the spotlight lobbing a    salvo in the next presidential race. \u201cA lot of that\u2019s about 2020 politics,\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, grumbled on MSNBC. Mr. McConnell\u2019s subsequent explanation for his maneuver seemed destined for a future Warren campaign ad: \u201cShe was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted. \u201d After an unsuccessful effort to draft her for the 2016 presidential race, Ms. Warren is considered a very early   for 2020, should she run. Mr. McConnell\u2019s coda has already been repurposed as a sort of rallying cry. Across social media, Ms. Warren\u2019s allies and supporters posted with the hashtag #shepersisted, calling to mind some Democrats\u2019 embrace of the term \u201cnasty woman\u201d after Mr. Trump deployed it to describe Hillary Clinton during a debate. Appearing with Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire in October, Ms. Warren reminded Mr. Trump that \u201cnasty women vote. \u201d After the vote to bar Ms. Warren from speaking further about Mr. Sessions, other senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Tom Udall of New Mexico, read Mrs. King\u2019s letter without facing any objection, prompting some activists to raise charges of sexism. Ms. Warren has long displayed an instinct for capitalizing on highly visible fights. After she was barred from speaking on the Senate floor, she began reading the 1986 letter from Mrs. King on Facebook. By Wednesday evening, the video had attracted more than nine million views. In the letter, Mrs. King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. took aim at Mr. Sessions\u2019s record on civil rights as a United States attorney in Alabama, saying he had used \u201cthe awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens. \u201d She called on the Senate not to confirm Mr. Sessions to a federal judgeship, and his nomination to that post was ultimately rejected. On Wednesday morning, in a conference room in the Capitol  \u2014   the vote prohibited Ms. Warren from speaking about the nomination only from the Senate floor  \u2014   Ms. Warren addressed civil rights leaders, recounting her long night. \u201cWhat hit me the hardest was, it is about silence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to shut people up. It\u2019s about saying, \u2018No, no, no, just go ahead and vote. \u2019\u201d She went on. \u201cThis is going to be hard,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the tools. There\u2019s going to be a lot that we will lose. But I guarantee, the one thing we will not lose, we will not lose our voices. \u201d As Democrats strain to navigate the early days of the Trump presidency, weighing the merits of the blanket opposition that many in their base seem to crave, the latest rancor appeared to raise the likelihood of further confrontation in the Senate chamber. Some   groups seemed comfortable with that. \u201cWhat the public needs to see from Democrats right now is more backbone and more standing on principle,\u201d said Adam Green, a   of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cElizabeth Warren continues to be the model for good behavior. \u201d The timing is fortunate for Ms. Warren, whose fiery denunciations of corporate greed have long made her a Democratic celebrity. Her new book deal was announced this week. Its title: \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class. \u201d Shortly after Mr. McConnell\u2019s objection on Tuesday, Ms. Warren called a favorite TV anchor, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, and spoke live on the air. On Wednesday, Republicans betrayed no regret for their move, accusing Ms. Warren of ignoring repeated warnings to avoid violating the Senate rule, known as Rule XIX. She had also read a letter from Edward M. Kennedy, who represented Massachusetts in the Senate, disparaging Mr. Sessions. \u201cYou don\u2019t insult  \u2014   whether it be from a letter, or from a message from God, or on golden tablets,\u201d said Senator John McCain of Arizona. \u201cThat\u2019s the rules of the Senate. They want to complain about it, complain about it. \u201d Democrats and their allies resumed their protest against Mr. Sessions on Wednesday with renewed swagger, despite their long odds of blocking his confirmation. \u201cIf Mr. McConnell or anybody else wants to deny me the right to debate Jeff Sessions\u2019s qualifications, go for it,\u201d Mr. Sanders said from the Senate floor hours before the vote. Since the election, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have been among the lawmakers jockeying to be leading messengers for Democratic politics under the Trump administration. There have been bumps. Last month, Ms. Warren faced rare criticism from liberals after voting in a Senate committee to approve Ben Carson as Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development, infuriating voters who had hoped for uniform opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet. Defending herself on Facebook at the time, Ms. Warren wrote that she appreciated the feedback. \u201cUnlike the new administration,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in ignoring or silencing people who disagree with the choices I make or the votes I take. \u201d This week, it seemed, all had been forgiven. MoveOn. org, the liberal political group, said it had collected about $300, 000 in contributions for Ms. Warren since Tuesday night. And by midafternoon, a   email from Ms. Warren had arrived in the inboxes of her supporters. \u201cI\u2019m still banned from speaking on the Senate floor  \u2014   but there\u2019s still time for you to make your voice heard,\u201d the email read, with a link to a page for contributions. She signed off with a familiar message: \u201cKeep fighting. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628455.8239794}
