A soldier opened fire, hitting the attacker several times, but not before he slashed at one of the other soldiers, causing minor injuries. The Paris prosecutor, Fran\u00e7ois Molins, said the attacker, who was 29 years old, was believed to be an Egyptian who arrived in France on Jan. 26 from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, on a visa he obtained last November. The intervention by soldiers from the 1er R\u00e9giment de Chasseurs Parachutistes, an airborne unit based in Pamiers, in southwestern France, \u201cended a terrorist attack and enabled the arrest of its perpetrator, who by all indications was very determined,\u201d Mr. Molins said. The assault took place on a stairway leading down to the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall that lies between the subway station closest to the museum and one of the museum\u2019s entrances. The attack was so close to the Louvre that it lit up social media networks. Within a couple hours of the assault, President Trump wrote on Twitter that the man was a \u201cradical Islamic terrorist,\u201d although the French authorities said it was too early to establish whether he had ties to any terrorist groups. Mr. Molins, who is known for sticking to the facts, refrained from saying anything about the man\u2019s motivations, but said that his passport had two visas to Turkey, in 2015 and 2016, and that he also had a visa for Saudi Arabia. He had a residency document for the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Molins did not say where the man might have traveled in Turkey. Until recently, a stretch of the eastern Turkish border with Syria was highly porous, and many people slipped into territory held by the Islamic State in Syria\u2019s northeast. The man was not known to the French security authorities, but he was identified through fingerprints and a photograph taken when he obtained his visa, Mr. Molins said. The suspect had rented an apartment for one week, paying about $1, 830, in a   neighborhood just four subway stops from the Louvre. Two days after arriving in Paris, he bought two     knives at an arms store in central Paris for about $730, according to the authorities. France has suffered more terrorist attacks and attempted attacks in recent years than any other country in Europe, and security officials believe that the country and especially its police and military forces, remain a target of choice for Islamic extremists. Some of those attacks involve knives and were carried out by people who say they were inspired by the example of the Islamic State even if they had never traveled to Syria or Iraq or sworn allegiance to the organization. Mr. Molins noted that Friday\u2019s attack occurred exactly two years after a similar attack on soldiers in Nice. In just the past 13 months, there have been at least four attacks in France using knives, including one instance in which an   police officer and wife were stabbed to death by a man who then filmed himself claiming allegiance to the Islamic State, broadcasting the video on Facebook. In St.    a small town in Normandy, a    man slit the throat of an elderly priest as he was saying Mass last July. The young man and an accomplice, who were fatally shot by the police, had proclaimed allegiance to the Islamic State just before the murder. Then there were the shocking assaults that claimed many more lives. On July 14, a man driving a truck plowed into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in the southern city of Nice, killing 86 people. And on Nov. 13, 2015, three attacks carried out by 10 Islamic State terrorists in and around Paris took the lives of 130 people. Although the Louvre attack was swiftly contained and involved only one assailant, it was likely to add to the woes of the museum and the city, where the number of visitors declined significantly in 2016 because of successive terrorist attacks and attempted attacks. The number of visitors to the Louvre was down 15 percent from 2015, and the number of foreign visitors fell, notably from Russia, Japan, China and Brazil. Friday\u2019s attack also coincided with the city\u2019s final presentation of its bid for the 2024 Olympic Games, casting something of a pall over a day that Paris officials had hoped would not be associated with terrorism. Still, the quick response by the military was likely to ease criticism about the expense and efficacy of using soldiers alongside the police to fight terrorism. When terrorists carried out a massacre at the Bataclan concert hall during the November 2015 attacks, soldiers were nearby but were not under orders to act and were unable to aid the police, raising questions about their usefulness. While the situation on Friday was different  \u2014   the soldiers were acting in    \u2014   it was described repeatedly by politicians and senior government officials as a display of preparedness and \u201c . \u201d About 10, 000 soldiers are deployed throughout France, with 3, 500 in the Paris region alone. Many people were also impressed by the calm efficiency displayed by the staffs of both the museum and the Carrousel du Louvre. The museum had several rooms designated as secure places, and guards escorted visitors to those areas. Bastien Lopez, 21, an intern at the museum, said he was at work when \u201call of a sudden we saw a huge flow of people coming in the museum, and the people in charge of the security shut down the three main access doors. \u201d \u201cThen they asked us to follow an itinerary that led us into a specific room,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere we stayed confined for two hours and a half. \u201d He stayed in one of the rooms of the department of Islamic art, in the museum\u2019s basement, with a few hundred people. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a rush: Everything went very smoothly,\u201d Mr. Lopez added. \u201cWe were not piled up we could all sit on the floor. Some people took a nap. \u201d \u201cThe tourists reacted super well. The security persons were given instructions that we translated in English and in Chinese. \u201d Thomas, a    who declined to give his surname, said he was doing maintenance work on electronic screens in the underground mall when he heard gunfire nearby. He suspected an attack, yet his first reaction was not fear, but a \u201csurvival instinct,\u201d fueled by a \u201csurge of adrenaline,\u201d he recalled as he stood near a police cordon a few hours later. \u201cI followed the protocol, which was to leave through the emergency exits, since we were in one of the stores,\u201d he said. \u201cI evacuated, and I took two people with me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562143.504011}
