In today\u2019s \u201csharing economy\u201d this relationship between government and big business is more prevalent than ever. \\nIn the case of rideshare services, Uber and Lyft, these new services have been vehemently opposed by Taxi companies, who offer a more expensive and less efficient service. Despite the fact that their service is sub-par, they are licensed and regulated by the government and thus are viewed as an accepted business by the establishment. \\nThe same principle is at play in the proliferation of Airbnb, the service that allows people to rent out rooms to others in a cheaper and more efficient way than hotels. Hotel companies are obviously not very happy about the rise of Airbnb, and have been lobbying the government to shut down their competition ever since the sharing economy began to threaten their bottom line. \\nIn New York, this lobbying has had success, and anti-Airbnb laws were passed that will force the service out of the city. \\nThe recently signed law will impose a $7,500 fine onto anyone who lists their property on the site. \\nFor anyone that did not think that the hotels in the city had a motive to force Airbnb out of the region, a Hotel executive was recently caught telling his shareholders that the passing of the new law will allow him to raise prices in his hotels. \\nIn a call with shareholders last week , Mike Barnello, CEO of LaSalle Hotel Properties said that the new law \u201cshould be a big boost in the arm for the business, certainly in terms of the pricing.\u201d \\nBarnello and other representatives at LaSalle declined to comment on the report, but Airbnb\u2019s public affairs director, Nick Papas, pointed out the obvious in a recent interview. \\n\u201cThey say a gaffe is unintentionally saying what you really believe \u2013 and the latest gaffe from the hotel cartel makes it clear that the New York bill was all about protecting the hotel industry\u2019s bottom line. Albany back-room dealing rewarded the price-gouging hotel industry and middle-class families will pay the price,\u201d Papas said. \\nThis is not an isolated incident either, hotel executives have actually been very open about their true motives for opposing Airbnb. In a similar call last year, Jon Bortz, CEO of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust said that Airbnb prevents him from being able to gouge customers. He literally used the word \u201cgouge\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. \\nIn the call, he said that Airbnb takes away his \u201cability to price at maybe what the customer would describe as sort of gouging rates. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve lost a lot of that ability at this point within the major markets where these events take place.\u201d \\nThe battle will be long and hard, and the government, along with these entrenched corporations, will lock up many innocent entrepreneurs. However, history has shown that innovation always wins out in the face of this type of government protectionism. After all, the record industry is now dwarfed by free streaming services, and we are lighting our homes with electric lights instead of candles.
