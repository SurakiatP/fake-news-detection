[On Monday, Tebow received news that he will stay busy for the foreseeable future.  According to Pro Football Talk, \u201cESPN announced (Monday) that it has extended Tebow\u2019s contract, and he\u2019ll keep working on the SEC Network as a college football studio commentator, and also work on the college football playoff. \u201d ESPN Senior VP of Event and Studio Production, Stephanie Druley explained the network\u2019s decision to extend Tebow, \u201cTim brings a wealth of knowledge and passion to his analysis of college football and surprised many fans with his strong opinions and engaging presence on SEC Nation. His unique experiences within the SEC and his broad national fan base are huge assets to SEC Nation and ESPN\u2019s larger CFP coverage. \u201d Tebow, understandably, approves of ESPN\u2019s decision. The former Heisman winner said, \u201cOver the last three years, ESPN and the SEC Nation crew have become like family. I love the passion that SEC fans bring to our set every Saturday morning, and I look forward to continuing to share my own love of the game with fans on ESPN and SEC Network. \u201d ESPN laid off a lot of good people over the last couple weeks, while retaining too many of the personalities who gave the network a dirty name. However, in this case, they got it right. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn'"}, "time": 1742562218.1103466}
