[Breitbart reported in November that ESPN lost 3. 2 million subscribers in just over a year. Moreover, for the last few years the sports network has lost 300, 000 subscribers a month. In October alone, the beleaguered network lost 621, 000 subscribers.   The decision to keep Iger instead of moving in another direction, such as promoting COO Thomas Staggs to the spot, has a number of substantial business implications for ESPN. Awful Announcing reports: From the outside, at least, it seems like Iger is quite satisfied with ESPN\u2019s leadership and with the network\u2019s path on most fronts. Specifically, he\u2019s regularly spoken about how important it is for ESPN to be in \u201cskinny bundles\u201d (including streaming options from Sling, DirecTV and more) and about ESPN\u2019s forthcoming    offering. Those views wouldn\u2019t necessarily be shared by a different CEO Staggs, for example, spoke much more about the importance of the traditional   bundle, so a Disney CEO with his views might focus more on that side, or conversely, another Disney CEO might want ESPN to quickly go into    in a larger way (standalone access to all ESPN content, including TV channels) rather than starting with the   light approach Iger seems to be promoting. Putting those circumstances aside, the crux of ESPN continuing on in its political and social agenda derives from the fact that Iger is a strident lifelong Democrat. One so committed, in fact, that the Disney stalwart   a Hillary Clinton fundraiser last summer along with   supporters such as entertainment Mogul Haim Saban, Chernin Group chairman and CEO Peter Chernin, and entertainment and sports executive Casey Wasserman.  To get an idea of Iger\u2019s taste on social issues, one of his proposed \u201centertainment\u201d ideas is a filmic version of Girls, a popular television show starring Lena Dunham. Somewhat surprisingly, and to the chagrin of many of his supporters and shareholders, Iger is serving on President Donald Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum council of CEOs. Iger agrees with Trump on shutting down certain tax loopholes and strongly supports lowering corporate tax rates (no surprise there).  Earlier this month, Iger reportedly defended his participation in Trump\u2019s mastermind group, asserting, \u201cI think there is an opportunity for me to express views that I think   \u2026     are of value to the company and its shareholders. \u201d Insisting that he won\u2019t be   Iger informs that he will be \u201cadversarial to the view of the administration,\u201d which includes \u201cimmigration. \u201d Yet, the CEO argues that claims asserting ESPN is politically slanted are \u201cjust a complete exaggeration. \u201d With that said, it looks like ESPN\u2019s cable subscription downward spiral will persist as long as Iger remains as Disney\u2019s top executive.
