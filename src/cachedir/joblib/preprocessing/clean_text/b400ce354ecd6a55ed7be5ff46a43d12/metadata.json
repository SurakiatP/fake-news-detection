[\u201cIran\u2019s third underground factory has been built by the Guards in recent years  \u2026     We will continue to further develop our missile capabilities forcefully,\u201d said Iranian air forces commander Amirali Hajizadeh, as quoted by the UK Daily Mail.  \u201cIt is natural that our enemies America and the Zionist regime are angry with our missile programme because they want Iran to be in a weak position,\u201d Hajizadeh added, referring to the United States and Israel. Reuters notes Hajizadeh stated the new facility would be Iran\u2019s third underground missile factory. He said it was constructed over the course of \u201crecent years,\u201d but evidently did not specify exactly when it began producing weapons. \u201cAlong with improving our defense capabilities, we will continue our missile tests and missile production. The next missile to be produced is a    missile,\u201d the Iranian commander said. The new missile series will be named \u201cDezful,\u201d after the site of the largest tank battle in the   War. According to Hajizadeh, the name is meant to convey Iran\u2019s commitment to avoiding ground wars by achieving missile superiority over its regional rivals. Iran\u2019s Mehr news agency quotes Hajizadeh boasting of Iran\u2019s   in missile production, and also its advances in drone technology and electronic warfare. \u201cWe will never forget the United States supported Saddam\u2019s Baath regime in its war against Iran, shot down our passenger flight, backed MKO, created ISIL and fueled war in Syria, Iraq and Yemen,\u201d he declared.  The passenger flight he referred to was Iran Air Flight 655, shot down by a U. S. Navy missile cruiser in 1988. \u201cMKO\u201d is the   Khalq Organization, an insurgent organization opposed to the government of Iran. A 2015 broadcast on Iranian television showed a network of tunnels with \u201c   missiles on the back of trucks,\u201d which was supposedly one of hundreds of underground bases supplied by Iran\u2019s missile factories. Sky News notes the announcement of this new missile factory came only days after the White House called upon newly   Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to end Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program.'"}, "time": 1742563900.7114012}
