The   and the explanation for it from Iran\u2019s foreign and defense ministries appeared to reflect   and longstanding suspicions of Russia despite their tactical alliance in the Syria war. The abruptness of the termination, even if temporary, also suggested that the Russians, eager to show widening influence in the Middle East, had seriously misread how a public announcement of their use of the Hamadan base in western Iran would reverberate among Iranians. Russia state news media had been trumpeting the deal as a sign that its partnership with Iran was deepening. No foreign power has based forces in Iran since World War II. In response to the annulment, the Russian military issued a statement saying its planes had already completed their missions. \u201cThe Russian military aircraft involved in launching airstrikes from the Iranian Hamadan base against terrorist sites in Syria successfully accomplished the tasks they had set out to complete,\u201d Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement. \u201cAll aircraft involved in this operation are now on Russian territory. \u201d The agreement had seemingly marked a milestone for Russian foreign policy and a strengthening alliance with the region\u2019s Shiite powers of Iran, Iraq and the government side in Syria\u2019s civil war. And it would have allowed Russia to use greater firepower more easily in Syria, a new threat to opposition fighters. It was not clear why the agreement appeared to unravel so soon, and experts and American officials cautioned that it remains to be verified via satellite images that Russia\u2019s operations from Iran have stopped. But Iran\u2019s minister of defense, Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan, accused Russia of having publicized the deal excessively, calling the Kremlin\u2019s behavior a \u201cbetrayal of trust\u201d and \u201cungentlemanly. \u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, told reporters in Tehran that the permission had been temporary and \u201cit is finished, for now. \u201d Maziar Behrooz, a history professor at San Francisco State University and an expert on   relations, said Iran\u2019s withdrawal of permission, at the very least, signaled \u201ca lack of coordination between the Iranians and Russians\u201d over how  \u2014   or even whether  \u2014   the deal would remain secret. \u201cThe Russians went public with this without assuring adequate sensitivities to Iran\u2019s internal dynamics, in order to perhaps score a point and boost their prestige,\u201d Mr. Behrooz said. \u201cIf the Russians hadn\u2019t exposed this, no problem would have arisen. \u201d It was only the latest in a series of ups and downs in the important but often uncomfortable relationship between Iran and Russia regarding the Syria war. Both sides have signaled they do not expect to agree on every issue. Their strategic collaboration is not considered under threat. But the perceived Russian arrogance may have been a step too far for Iranian sensitivities since the Russian takeover, nearly a year ago, of Iran\u2019s role as the Syrian government\u2019s leading ally. The Russians have deployed formidable air power since September to help the forces of President Bashar   of Syria, who had been ceding ground. Iran and its militia allies still bear the brunt of the casualties as Russia has few troops on the ground. Iran and Russia share major goals, chiefly preventing the ouster of President Assad by force. And they each have a stake in battling Islamist extremists they see as threats to their own security. But they have very different approaches, roles, and   visions. Russia\u2019s priority is to block what it sees as   regime change, part of its policy of opposing interference in any country\u2019s internal affairs, and to preserve Syrian state institutions. It has signaled that it is not wedded to Mr. Assad\u2019s   rule. Iran appears more focused on preserving and expanding its projection of power into the Middle East through relationships with the Lebanese group Hezbollah, other Shiite militias and with Mr. Assad, who has long guaranteed Hezbollah an arms supply route from Iran and belongs to the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam, the dominant faith in Iran. At the same time, Iran fueled the growth of Syrian   militias, preferring to work with them. Since jumping into the conflict at a point where Iran seemed unable to keep Mr. Assad from faltering, Russia has tried to integrate these militias into the army. Iran and Russia face challenges collaborating in the field. Hezbollah fighters and supporters openly disdain the Syrian Army, and grumble that Russia has not given air support to its fighters. And Russian officials feel more comfortable dealing with Syrian Army commanders  \u2014   many of them educated in Russia  \u2014   than with the Shiite religious trappings of the militias. Russia and Iran also differ sharply on Israel. Iran and Israel see each other as irreconcilable enemies, while Russia maintains close relations with Israel, home to a million Russian emigrants. Then there is Iran\u2019s long memory of the Russian empire battling the Persian Empire and gobbling up its periphery. To Iran, with its   national identity, it was not that long ago that the Russians were the enemy, fighting for control of Central Asia and the Caucasus \u201cRussia is not trusted. They just don\u2019t trust each other,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a   political risk consultancy. Russia\u2019s flaunting of its Iran base privilege, he said, \u201cwas just too much for Iranian domestic politics to bear. \u201d With a history of meddling by Western powers, notably Britain, Iran guards its sovereignty closely. After Russia\u2019s Tupolev and Sukhoi bombers started flying last week, Iranian members of Parliament said the agreement might be in violation of the Constitution. \u201cWe have not given any military base to the Russians and they are not here to stay,\u201d General Dehghan said. The two countries had \u201cno written agreement\u201d for use of the base, he said, adding that it was only a temporary agreement on refueling. Russia announced what it described as a deal to use the Iranian base on Aug. 16, saying it would shorten the distance flown by   bombers, which had been flying from southern Russia. A Russian analyst of the Middle East, Yuri Barmin, posted on Twitter that it was clear the base was \u201ca temporary arrangement due to logistical difficulties\u201d but added that the termination \u201cwas too quick. \u201d Victor Mizin, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Russia\u2019s university for diplomats, said the symbolism of the air base deal had been important in Moscow. \u201cThe message was a continuation of what Russia started in Syria,\u201d Mr. Mizin said, \u201cwhich is saying that Russia has returned to the status of a great power, like the Soviet Union, only without the ideology. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562092.947627}
