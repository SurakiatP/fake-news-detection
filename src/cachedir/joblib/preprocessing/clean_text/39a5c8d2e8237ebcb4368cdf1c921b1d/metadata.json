Maybe a little too powerful. The medium dominates conversations while film buffs are arguing whether the movies are dying. There are ever more scripted series  \u2014   a record 409 last year  \u2014   and more outlets to put them on. And as the host Jimmy Kimmel reminded us at Sunday night\u2019s Emmy Awards on ABC, a   personality is close to running the whole show in America  \u2014   even if that wasn\u2019t a point of pride to the host or to much of the crowd. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president?\u201d Mr. Kimmel asked in a scathing run of jokes, pointing out the producer of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in the audience. \u201cThanks to Mark Burnett, we don\u2019t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we\u2019re living in one. \u201d The cultural ubiquity of TV was a theme of the night, and so was the tension between the night\u2019s crowd of stars and winners and the TV entertainer who\u2019s dominated the year\u2019s nonfiction programming. It started with the opening sketch, in which Mr. Kimmel hitched a ride to the ceremony with several celebrities. Among them was Jeb Bush, one of several Republicans defenestrated by Mr. Trump, who said that he was now driving for Uber. \u201cIf you run a positive campaign, voters will ultimately make the right choice,\u201d Mr. Bush said, adding, \u201cThat was a joke. \u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one joking about Mr. Trump, however ruefully. The comedian Aziz Ansari, of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaster of None,\u201d declared that he was going to enforce Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and order Muslims and Hispanics out of the audience. \u201cAmerica Ferrera?\u201d he said to the actress. \u201cNice try changing your name to \u2018America.\u2019 You\u2019re not fooling anybody!\u201d As expected, it was a big night for FX\u2019s \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story,\u201d a limited series that, like the campaign, represented a powerful synthesis of reality and entertainment. The series also exemplified how the Emmys cleared the admittedly low bar of diversity set by the 2016 Oscars, all of whose acting nominees were white. It not only showcased   actors  \u2014   Courtney B. Vance and Sterling K. Brown won for lead and supporting  \u2014   but it also made race (and, through Sarah Paulson\u2019s character, Marcia Clark, gender) a subject. That was also true of \u201cMaster of None,\u201d whose Alan Yang and Mr. Ansari shared a   award for an episode about   immigrant families. And while the industry still hasn\u2019t achieved parity for female directors, two women won directing awards: Susanne Bier for the limited series \u201cThe Night Manager\u201d and Jill Soloway for her comedy \u201cTransparent,\u201d who ended her acceptance speech, \u201cTopple the patriarchy!\u201d Regarding which, both the lead and supporting comedy acting categories were won by men playing women: Louie Anderson, for a supporting character on \u201cBaskets,\u201d and Jeffrey Tambor, again winning best actor for playing a transgender woman on Ms. Soloway\u2019s series. Mr. Tambor used his acceptance to urge the industry to cast more transgender performers. It was up to Mr. Kimmel to tweak the   of the night. \u201cThe only thing we value more than diversity,\u201d he said, \u201cis congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. \u201d He\u2019s both the snarkiest of the major networks\u2019   hosts and a TV classicist at heart, the sort of roastmaster and toastmaster who could spike the punchbowl without tipping it completely over. There was a little shaking up of the   categories, which both went to   winners in    performances. Tatiana Maslany won for \u201cOrphan Black,\u201d and Rami Malek quoted his own   character from \u201cMr. Robot\u201d: \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re seeing this, too. \u201d The surprises ended before the night did: exactly as last year, HBO won both best drama for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (  as it raced ahead of its source books but not as deserving as FX\u2019s \u201cThe Americans\u201d) and best comedy for the political satire \u201cVeep,\u201d which last year broke the hammerlock of \u201cModern Family\u201d and may now have the category in its own grip. But you can\u2019t argue that the comedy didn\u2019t feel of the moment. Accepting the award for best lead actress in a comedy, Julia   (the star of \u201cVeep\u201d) said that the program \u201cnow feels like a sobering documentary. \u201d At the night\u2019s end, Mr. Kimmel congratulated the awardscast for ending neatly on time: \u201cWe finished before the election came!\u201d But as we\u2019ve seen for a while, and the Emmys reminded us, it\u2019s not entirely clear where TV ends and the election begins.'"}, "time": 1742563210.9832087}
