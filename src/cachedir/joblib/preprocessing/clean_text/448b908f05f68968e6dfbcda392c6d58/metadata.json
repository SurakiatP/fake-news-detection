Todd asked, \u201cI\u2019m curious why president trump chose yesterday to send out his press secretary to essentially litigate a provable falsehood when it comes to a small and petty thing like inaugural crowd size. my question to you is why do that.? After her answer Todd again said, \u201cYou did not answer the question. Why did the president send out his press secretary who is not just the spokesperson for Donald Trump, he is also the spokesperson for all of America at times. He speaks for all of the country at times, why put him out there for the very first time in front of that podium to utter a provable falsehood? It\u2019s a small thing, but the first time he confronts the public it\u2019s a falsehood. \u201d Conway said  \u201cChuck, if we\u2019re going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms, I think we are going to have to rethink our relationship here. I want a great open relationship with our press. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628343.6497228}
