At a Senate confirmation hearing, Mr. Carson, 65, strained at times to square his past remarks on the dangers of federal assistance  \u2014   he once called poverty \u201creally more of a choice than anything else\u201d  \u2014   with the mission of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an agency with a $47 billion budget and a mandate to help millions of   renters and struggling homeowners. Forgoing many specifics, he laid out a vision of a more \u201cholistic\u201d approach: recruiting private sector dollars and seeking to end what he called a cycle of \u201cgeneration after generation of people living in dependent situations. \u201d \u201cSafety net programs are important. I would never advocate abolishing them without having an alternative for people to follow,\u201d he said, adding that \u201csome have distorted what I\u2019ve said about government. \u201d Yet Americans had come to view HUD\u2019s mission as \u201cputting roofs over the heads of poor people,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cIt has the ability to be so much more than that. \u201d As with his presidential campaign, Mr. Carson leaned heavily on his own compelling biography, straying frequently from his prepared opening remarks as he spoke of life in an impoverished section of Detroit as the son of a single mother with a   education. He waded through several contentious moments, including some aimed at his prospective boss,   Donald J. Trump, and the specter of conflicts over HUD funding and Trump family business ventures. But Mr. Carson, who was prone to fits of spaciness and occasionally bewildering remarks as a candidate, appeared to avoid any major slips on Thursday. The tone of the proceedings diverged sharply from that of hearings this week for Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state, and Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and the selection for attorney general. Both men faced aggressive questioning from Democrats  \u2014   and, in Mr. Tillerson\u2019s case, from a Republican, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. On Thursday, Mr. Rubio introduced Mr. Carson as a leader with \u201cthe values, the compassion and the character and the kind of drive that we need. \u201d Senators from both parties made warm reference to Mr. Carson\u2019s granddaughter in attendance, who wore pink headphones during the testimony. They thanked him for his career in medicine. Even some of the more pointed questioners, like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, were disarmed. \u201cYou remind me of Columbo,\u201d Mr. Carson said at one point, to extended laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve actually heard that before,\u201d Mr. Brown said. Still, there were sharp exchanges. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, sought to pin Mr. Carson down on a simple question: \u201cCan you assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar that you give out will financially benefit the   or his family?\u201d Mr. Carson said he would be driven by morals. Ms. Warren cut him off, saying her specific concern was whether grants and loans could specifically benefit Mr. Trump. \u201cIt will not be my intention to do anything to benefit any American,\u201d Mr. Carson said, becoming flustered for a moment before quickly clarifying that he wanted to use the department to help \u201call Americans. \u201d Ms. Warren called on Mr. Trump to establish a blind trust, accusing him of \u201chiding\u201d his assets. Mr. Carson would not commit definitively to avoiding Trump businesses if confirmed. \u201cIf there happens to be an extraordinarily good program that\u2019s working for millions of people and it turns out that someone that you\u2019re targeting is going to gain $10 from it, am I going to say no?\u201d Mr. Carson said. Later, he agreed to work with Mr. Brown to construct a system to identify properties tied both to the Trump family and the department. He committed to telling senators about the department\u2019s dealings with any businesses owned by Mr. Trump or his relatives. More often, Mr. Carson sat patiently as lawmakers recited some of the most fraught comments of his public life. In one interaction, Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, asked if Mr. Carson truly believed in HUD\u2019s mission, given his trail of comments railing against government intervention. \u201cI think the rental assistance program is essential,\u201d Mr. Carson said, when pressed twice, \u201cand what I have said if you\u2019ve been reading my writings: It is cruel and unusual punishment to withdraw those programs before you provide an alternative. \u201d When asked about housing protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens, Mr. Carson, a vocal opponent of   marriage, said he would \u201cenforce all the laws of the land\u201d if confirmed. But he expressed his personal opposition to any expression of what he called \u201cextra rights\u201d for certain groups. For Republicans, the hearing supplied an opportunity to pay tribute to a figure revered by the conservative base. Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, asked Mr. Carson what he thought was \u201cthe best possible thing we can do for someone on government assistance. \u201d \u201cGet them off it,\u201d Mr. Carson said.'"}, "time": 1742561858.0163019}
