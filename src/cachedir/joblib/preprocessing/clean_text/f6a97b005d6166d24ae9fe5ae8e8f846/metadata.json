But like an array of other   members of Brazil\u2019s Congress, Mr. Maluf says he is so fed up with all the corruption in the country that he supports ousting President Dilma Rousseff. \u201cI\u2019m against all the dubious   this government does,\u201d said Mr. Maluf, 84, a former S\u00e3o Paulo mayor who faces charges in the United States that he stole more than $11. 6 million in a kickback scheme. The drive to impeach Ms. Rousseff is gaining momentum. A pivotal vote to send her case to the Senate for a possible trial is expected over the weekend, and several of the political parties in her governing coalition abandoned her this week, leaving her especially vulnerable. But some of the most vocal lawmakers pushing to impeach Ms. Rousseff are facing serious charges of graft, electoral fraud and human rights abuses, uncorking a national debate about hypocrisy among Brazil\u2019s leaders. \u201cDilma may have dug her own grave by not delivering on what she promised, but she is untainted in a political realm smeared with excrement from top to bottom,\u201d said Mario Sergio Conti, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. \u201cShe didn\u2019t steal, but a gang of thieves is judging her. \u201d Ms. Rousseff is deeply resented in Brazil, having presided over the worst economic crisis in decades, a huge corruption scandal engulfing the national oil company and the fall of millions of   Brazilians into poverty. In the impeachment case, she is not facing charges of graft. Instead, she is accused of using money from giant public banks to cover budget gaps, damaging Brazil\u2019s economic credibility. Ms. Rousseff, then, is something of a rarity among Brazil\u2019s major political figures: She has not been accused of stealing for herself. Eduardo Cunha, the powerful speaker of the lower house who is leading the impeachment effort, is going on trial at the country\u2019s highest court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal, on charges that he pocketed as much as $40 million in bribes. Mr. Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator and economist who regularly issues Twitter messages quoting from the Bible, is accused of laundering the gains through an evangelical megachurch. Vice President Michel Temer, who is expected to take over if Ms. Rousseff is forced to step aside, has been accused of involvement in an illegal   scheme. Renan Calheiros, the Senate leader, who is also on the presidential succession chain, is under investigation over claims that he received bribes in the giant scandal surrounding the national oil company, Petrobras. He has also been accused of tax evasion and of allowing a lobbyist to pay child support for a daughter from an extramarital affair. Altogether, 60 percent of the 594 members of Brazil\u2019s Congress face serious charges like bribery, electoral fraud, illegal deforestation, kidnapping and homicide, according to Transparency Brazil, a   group. The issue has even become a part of the president\u2019s defense strategy. In particular, Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued, how can the impeachment process be directed by someone who is going on trial for corruption himself? On Thursday, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, the solicitor general, said that his office had appealed to the Supreme Federal Tribunal in an attempt to block the impeachment proceedings. He said the effort to oust Ms. Rousseff had become so sprawling that it was \u201ca true Kafkaesque process in which the defendant cannot figure out with any certainty what she is being accused of or why. \u201d In a session that went past midnight and into the early hours of Friday, a majority of justices on the high court rejected the Rousseff administration\u2019s request to annul this weekend\u2019s impeachment vote. No one can dispute that Ms. Rousseff is very unpopular around the country, as reflected in her nearly   approval ratings, the broad ire over bribery and kickbacks within her Workers\u2019 Party, and the regular street protests demanding her ouster. Even so, some Brazilians argue that the impeachment upheaval has less to do with stamping out corruption than with an effort to shift power by lawmakers with questionable records themselves. Ms. Rousseff\u2019s opponents in Congress include \u00c9der Mauro, who is facing charges of torture and extortion from his previous stint as a police officer in Bel\u00e9m, a   city in the Amazon. Another congressman aiming to impeach Ms. Rousseff: Beto Mansur, who is charged with keeping 46 workers at his soybean farms in Goi\u00e1s State in conditions so deplorable that investigators say the laborers were treated like   slaves. Almost daily, prosecutors reveal accusations involving Ms. Rousseff\u2019s allies and adversaries in Congress, saying they pocketed bribes in the colossal graft scheme surrounding   energy companies. Graphic photos even circulated this month of prostitutes operating in a wing of Congress reserved for committee deliberations, reminding Brazilians of the institution\u2019s circuslike atmosphere these days. Luis Almagro, secretary general of the Organization of American States, criticized the impeachment process, saying the accusations against Ms. Rousseff \u201care not crimes, but they are related to poor administration. \u201d He said that the president\u2019s missteps were \u201cactions that other presidents in the past took themselves,\u201d but that Brazil\u2019s politicians were \u201cjudging her differently. \u201d Mr. Almagro also criticized the politicians who were pushing for impeachment but facing corruption accusations themselves. \u201cI am worried about the credibility of some of those who are going to judge or decide this impeachment process,\u201d he said. Mr. Maluf, the former mayor who supports the president\u2019s removal, spent weeks in jail a decade ago on charges of money laundering and tax evasion. But he was released under a law allowing people older than 70 to face such accusations at home. Then Mr. Maluf won a seat in Congress, giving him the privileged judicial standing that keeps nearly all senior Brazilian politicians with such privileges out of jail. Despite Mr. Maluf\u2019s claims in recent days that he could travel outside Brazil without being arrested, he remains wanted by Interpol for the case against him in the United States, according to the United States Justice Department. France also has an outstanding warrant for his arrest in a separate case involving organized money laundering. \u201cMy public life was always the opposite of all that,\u201d Mr. Maluf said last week, criticizing the bad deeds in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government, including her scramble to offer cabinet posts to legislators on the fence over impeachment. Scholars note the sweeping legal protections enjoyed by about 700 senior officials, including cabinet ministers and every member of Congress. Only the Supreme Federal Tribunal can try them, producing years of appeals and delays. \u201cWinning election to Congress is a license to steal for certain figures,\u201d said Sylvio Costa, the founder of Congresso em Foco, a watchdog group that tracks legislative corruption. \u201cIn this grotesque system, the biggest thieves are those who wield the most power. \u201d Claims of misdeeds among other lawmakers do not bother some of the politicians wanting Ms. Rousseff impeached. Roberto Jefferson, a former legislator who went to prison after his conviction for his role in a   scheme, said that Mr. Cunha\u2019s talent for political   served as a strategic advantage. \u201cThe bandit I\u2019m rooting for the most is Eduardo Cunha,\u201d Mr. Jefferson said. (Several lawmakers seeking to oust Ms. Rousseff, including Mr. Cunha, either declined requests for comment or did not respond.) One prominent supporter of Ms. Rousseff is Fernando Collor de Mello, the disgraced former president who resigned in 1992 over an   scandal. He resurrected his political career as a senator, only to face charges now of taking bribes in the graft scheme around the national oil company. Mr. Collor\u2019s father, Arnon de Mello, set a precedent after fatally shooting a fellow senator on the Senate floor in 1963. Arnon de Mello managed to avoid prison after a court ruled that the episode was an accident  \u2014   because he was aiming at another senator. As tempers flare over impeachment, some cite the example of Ivo Cassol, a senator from the Amazon. He was sentenced to more than four years in prison in 2013 by the Supreme Federal Tribunal on corruption charges related to contracts granted more than 15 years ago. (Mr. Cassol considers himself innocent in the case, a spokesman said.) Despite the ruling, Mr. Cassol remains in the Senate, keeping the high court\u2019s decision at bay with appeals. He is now delivering some of the most impassioned speeches in favor of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, calling her government \u201cdisgraceful. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562139.4083602}
