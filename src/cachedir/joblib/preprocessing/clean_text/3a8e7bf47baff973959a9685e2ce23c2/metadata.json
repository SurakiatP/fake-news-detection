As a rather strange tool, in fact: an entrepreneurial Chinese woman is said to have convinced 20 men that she has been dating to buy her iPhones, which she would then sell and use the money as a downpayment for a house. The purchase of a house is probably the single biggest one-time spending in the lifetime of a person, and it could take long years of hard work, so it is indeed remarkable that the woman found the quick way to get there (however, not the most ethical one, arguably). Let\u2019s make it clear: the story seems to have started on local Tian Ya Yi Du forum, where someone by the nickname Proud Qiaoba told the story of how her co-worker Xiaoli (not her real name) asked each of her 20 current boyfriends to buy her the new iPhone 7. How in the world is it possible to simulatenously date 20 people remains a mystery that gives this whole story a bit of a fairy tale aura, but knowing that China suffers from a terrible male-to-female ratio let\u2019s assume that is somehow possible. Xiaoli, whose life remains veiled in secrecy, then sold all of the phones to a suspiciously particular place: mobile phone recycling site Hui Shou Bao, all for a total of 120,000 Chinese yuan, the equivalent of around $17,500. The woman then used the cash for a downpayment towards a countryhouse home. Xiaoli broke the news when she invited her co-workers for a house warming party. \u201cEveryone in the office is talking about this now. Who knows what her boyfriends think now this news has become public.\u201d From Qiaoba we also learn that Xiaoli \u201cis not from a wealthy family. Her mum is a housewife and her dad is a migrant worker, and she is the oldest daughter. Her parents are getting old and she might be under a lot pressure hoping to buy them a house\u2026 But it\u2019s still unbelievable that she could use this method!\u201d \\nIt does indeed sound quite fantastical and made-up, and some have theorized that it\u2019s all just a theory to popularize the local Hui Shou Bao phone re-seller (the company has confirmed that it had indeed sold 20 iPhones from a single person recently). Meanwhile, the whole story quickly started becoming popular in China: a \u201920 mobiles for a house\u2019 hashtag went trending on local microblog Weibo and has been used more than 13 million times. Reaction sway from admiration for Xiaoli\u2019s boyfriend-getting and management skills to sheer awe and condemnation of her actions. Whatever it is, Xiaoli \u2013 if she even exists \u2013 is now said to shy away from the public eye and to refuse interviews from media. That\u2019s actually not surprising\u2026 those 20 boyfriends surely would not be happy about her actions. Source:'"}, "time": 1742628341.8673482}
