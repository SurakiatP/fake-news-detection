These bureaucrats have managed to convinced millions of their scheme, when in fact, it\u2019s all a part of their plan to shove the \u2018mass death\u2019 agenda down people\u2019s throats all while claiming they are \u2018saving the Earth!\u2019 It\u2019s absurd! The truth is if all 6.9 billion of us stood shoulder to shoulder and gathered together in the same general location it would fill only the state of Los Angeles. Or if everyone in the world was given a small house and yard and were once again gathered together in the same general location, it would fill only the states of Texas, California, and New Mexico with room to spare.Don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s do the math. Texas has 171 million acres, California has 101 million acres, and New Mexico has 77 million acres , which is a grand total of 349 million acres of land. We can safely assume most households house two persons, (usually it\u2019s more, but we\u2019ll stick with two) If each household was given 0.10 acre (or 20 people per acre because there are 2 persons per household; which leaves plenty of room for a house and land); then we would have the total number of occupants at 6,980,000,000 persons (349 million acres x 20 people per acre). Which is more than enough room to house our 6,900,000,000 population. Keep in mind this doesn\u2019t even take into consideration people living in apartments. The demographics can change based on how people are concentrated. See the map below. Thomas Malthus\u2019 Overpopulation Lie Thomas Malthus, who is the originator of the overpopulation lie, was a British mathematician. His most studied work, \u201c An Essay on the Principle of Population as it Affects the Future Improvements of Society, with Remarks on the Speculations of M. Godwin, M. Condorcet and Other Writers ,\u201d was first published around the late 1700\u2032s. In it he stated, \u201cOverpopulation would destroy the world unless war, famine, and disease rose to check human growth.\u201d He theorized that when population increased and food production increased only arithmetically, then food production would no longer be able to keep up with the populace. He then declared that the world would be out of food by the year 1890. Obviously he was dead wrong and yet we still see his principles applied today. But how realistic is his belief that food would not keep up with demand? Consider this, it takes about 300 sq. meters to feed one person for a year. Since a kilometer is 1,000 meters, we could feed 3,333 people per sq. kilometer, but let\u2019s use 3,000 people per sq. kilometer to make math easy. Meaning it would take 2,333,333 sq. kilometers (or 3000 \u00f7 7,000,000,000) to feed the entire population for a year. The total farmland in the US is about 922,000,000 acres of land . There are 247.1 acres per sq. kilometer , meaning there is a total of 3,731,282 sq. kilometers (or 922,000,000 \u00f7 247.1) of farm land. That\u2019s more than the 2,333,333 sq. kilometers needed to feed the entire population. In other words, the farmland in the US can feed us all! So why does the Government Continue to Insist we are Overpopulated? That\u2019s simple\u2026 MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY! Along with many major corporations, they seek any opportunity to be billionaires. But even worse, these power elite \u2014 per the Georgia Guidestones \u2014 desire serious population reduction. Instead of the 6.9 billion population, they desire 500,000,000 people. Ultimately, their end game is EUGENICS! Al Gore , Bill Gates , Ted Turner , and others like them, are using their power, wealth, and influence to manipulate the masses. They believe they can decide who is worthy to live and die. Their eugenics agenda lives on, and the bought and controlled media continues to churn out propaganda telling us we have to die so that the Earth (and the elite) may live on. What a load of crap! In conclusion the world\u2019s population is declining not increasing. As I see it fertility rates are rising, abortions are skyrocketing, contraception are in high demand, governments are limiting the number of children in China, we are eating sterilizing foods, and drinking fluoride water, which are all preventing us from any major population growth. Eventually we\u2019ll enter a new paradigm in which the elderly outnumber the younger. In 30 years or so well see the full effect of what the power elite have in store for us.
