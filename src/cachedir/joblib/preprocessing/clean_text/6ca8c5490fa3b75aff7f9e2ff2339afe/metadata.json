When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences named \u201cMoonlight\u201d best picture on Sunday, the organization made cultural history, and not just for the bonkers way the victory was announced. For the first time, Hollywood backed a   film  \u2014   one with an   cast  \u2014   as its finest cinematic work. Now the pressure is on A24, the relatively new studio behind \u201cMoonlight,\u201d to use that achievement to fill theater seats. A24 said on Tuesday that it had booked \u201cMoonlight\u201d into at least 1, 500 theaters in the United States for the coming weekend. That would be the film\u2019s widest release by far. While \u201cMoonlight\u201d has been chugging along in theaters for 20 weeks now  \u2014   a feat unto itself that speaks to A24\u2019s nurturing  \u2014   it has so far played in a maximum of 1, 104 locations, a relatively small footprint. By comparison, \u201cLa La Land\u201d played 3, 236 theaters at its widest point. The question is whether the best picture designation and the enormous media attention generated by the Oscars ceremony will convince mainstream ticket buyers who have not yet supported \u201cMoonlight\u201d to take a gander. Despite its long run, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d which also won Oscars for its screenplay and for Mahershala Ali\u2019s acting, has taken in only $22. 1 million at domestic theaters, held back by its subject matter, lack of star power and novelistic structure. Ticket sales so far for \u201cMoonlight\u201d are the second lowest on record for a best picture winner, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data. \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d which took in $17 million in 2009, or $19 million after adjusting for inflation, is the lowest. (\u201cMoonlight\u201d only cost $1. 5 million to make. \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d cost $15 million.) A24 declined to comment for this article. The   Oscar Bump at the box office varies widely. Some films have already concluded their theatrical runs and receive nothing. In other instances, the effect can be substantial. According to comScore, the previous three   winners  \u2014   \u201cSpotlight,\u201d \u201cBirdman,\u201d \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d  \u2014   each generated 10 percent or more of their total domestic grosses after their victories. For winners that are seen as especially arty, the boost can be even bigger. \u201cThe Artist,\u201d a    largely silent film that was named best picture in 2012, collected 29 percent of its total gross after that year\u2019s Oscar ceremony. A24, which was founded in 2012 and focuses on      movies, has gained a reputation as one of the savvier specialty film distributors in Hollywood. In the case of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d directed and   by Barry Jenkins, A24 first released the film in   in only four theaters in New York and Los Angeles to begin building word of mouth. The company then began testing demand in theaters in cities like Atlanta and Washington that drew a   of mainstream and specialty film ticket buyers, many of them  . In the film\u2019s 13th weekend  \u2014   using the Golden Globes as a peg  \u2014   A24 pushed \u201cMoonlight\u201d from 135 theaters to 582. But demand was soft in spots: In most areas of the country, the multiplex crowd was not yet on board. Only after the Oscar nominations (\u201cMoonlight\u201d received eight) did the film manage to cross the   mark. (It was released on DVD on Tuesday.) \u201cA24 has done a fantastic job of nurturing and protecting this film,\u201d said Daniel Loria, editorial director of Box Office Media. \u201cTo pay sustained attention to   runs over the course of months, that takes real commitment. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564039.5511947}
