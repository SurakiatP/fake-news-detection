Her original goal was to discuss President Trump\u2019s address to Muslim leaders in Riyadh, but she began by talking about the previous night\u2019s horrific terrorist attack at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. [\u201cIt\u2019s a grim morning,\u201d said Nomani. \u201cI know so many young folks who love Ariana Grande. It could be any concert, anywhere. It\u2019s just another tragedy. \u201d  LISTEN: \u201cI also feel the connection to the reality of the patterns of Islamic extremism and terrorism,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe know that the U. K. has a history of radicalization. \u201d Referring to a news clip in which Prime Minister Theresa May said it was not known if the Manchester attacker acted alone or was part of a network, Nomani said, \u201cAt the end of the day, if it is Islamic extremism, we know that it\u2019s part of a wider network of ideology. \u201d \u201cThat brings us to the speech in Saudi Arabia, and the connection between all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s tragedy, more blood spilled on the streets of our world. I\u2019ve always been saying we have to wake up to the realities of the ideological threat that we face. \u201d After speaking with a caller who doubted Islam is compatible with Western values, Marlow asked Nomani for her response. \u201cI understand the sentiment,\u201d she said. \u201cI emerge from moments like this also very angry and very grim about the prospects of the capacity for our faith to integrate well with the West. \u201d  \u201cWhat I say is I\u2019m a Muslim who was born in India to a mother who had to wear the face veil, so you know that we came from a very conservative interpretation of Islam,\u201d she recalled.  \u201cI came to America. I grew up on Nancy Drew as my best friend. I was a    which many people don\u2019t even know still exists. I was a Girl Scout. My mom didn\u2019t want to sign the permission slip to let me go square dance because girls were not supposed to dance with boys. I forced her to do so and had my first dance with a young boy who came from a Jewish family in Morgantown, West Virginia,\u201d she said.  \u201cWhat is Islam? There is no monolithic interpretation of the faith, just like there is no one interpretation of Christianity or Judaism,\u201d Nomani contended. \u201cAnd so we sit, many of us in our Muslim community, as reformers challenging the hardcore conservative orthodox ideology that I do believe is the sort of impetus for the ire of folks like your caller, who don\u2019t think there is a possibility for compatibility. \u201d  \u201cWhat we argue is for values that are in sync with Western values. We use Islamic theology as our grounding. We are engaged in a struggle for the soul of Islam  \u2014   in a struggle just like Catholics were in the Inquisition, trying to face a church that was burning and killing their own Catholics who thought differently. I just wish and hope that people would allow for the expanse that there is, that includes us as Muslims challenging that orthodoxy that also angers us,\u201d she said. Nomani shared Marlow\u2019s concern that the more hardline, and even radical, interpretations of Islam seem to be proliferating more quickly than the reformist approach she advocates. She said her mission was made more difficult by the left\u2019s contention that \u201cyou can\u2019t have this conversation and that you can\u2019t talk about the extremism problem otherwise, you\u2019re an Islamophobe or a racist or a bigot. \u201d \u201cI literally said to my friend, \u2018We need you. You have to have our backs. We can\u2019t have you abandon us because we are facing so much,\u2019\u201d she recalled saying to a friend with whom she was arguing. \u201cA while ago, just over a year ago, I started a petition to have a boycott of the government of Saudi Arabia. I knew, as a Muslim, that that was not going to happen. I voted for Donald Trump because I believed that he was going to be able to figure out some way that we could challenge the extremism. I knew that with bases in Qatar and Saudi Arabia that we\u2019re going to have to cut some kind of a deal. We\u2019re going to have to incentivize these guys in a way that was not going to be aligned with my ideas of a boycott against these exporters of extremism,\u201d she acknowledged.  \u201cThis week, in a scenario that I could never have imagined, Donald Trump went there to Saudi Arabia, did the sword dance, got the golden necklace  \u2014   all moments that turned my stomach as a Muslim, as a Muslim reformer especially,\u201d Nomani said. \u201cBut then the next day, through the genius that he has figured out, he was able to have this audience in which he dared to call out Islamic extremism. \u201d  \u201cFolks have tried to do this tap dance that he was tired and didn\u2019t mean to say \u2018Islamic.\u2019 Well, he said Islamic. He said Islamist. He called it out, and he said what needs to be said, which is it needs to be destroyed. It needs to be rooted out of our communities, out of our mosques,\u201d she declared.  \u201cWhen I went to Rome some years ago, I did what I called the \u2018heretic score.\u2019 I went to all the places where people in the Catholic Church were burned and killed and hung and persecuted. But Catholics persevered, and now there is a very different church than there existed during the Inquisition,\u201d she observed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait hundreds of years, trust me. I just want to have some hope that we can have transformation. Stand with us, please. \u201d In Nomani\u2019s estimation, President Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East has been \u201cgenius. \u201d \u201cIn the seventh century, Prophet Mohammed flew on this mythical creature, the story goes  \u2014   a winged horse, Buraq. This horse took him from Mecca to Jerusalem, to that place that\u2019s the Dome of the Rock now. That\u2019s what my name means. \u2018Asra\u2019 is that journey. I could never have imagined that a President of the United States would get flying rights to go from Saudi Arabia to Israel,\u201d she said.  \u201cThat happened, and he even uttered the words \u2018Israel\u2019 and \u2018Netanyahu\u2019 in Saudi Arabia without somebody throwing off their shoe and flying it across the chandelier room to smack him in the face. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d she observed, humorously citing the Arab custom of throwing shoes to express severe disapproval.   \u201cI actually think that if you talk    with these power brokers, who ultimately care about their bottom lines  \u2014   including in the Palestinian territory, there could actually be deals cut that forge a   solution, that forge an acceptance of the state of Israel,\u201d Nomani advised.  \u201cMy dream as a Muslim, as a human being, as a citizen of this world, is that before my    grows into adulthood, there will be a retreat by the government of Saudi Arabia from this poisonous ideology that has corrupted minds from Manchester, England, to Orlando, Florida, back to my home in the state of Virginia right now. It has to happen,\u201d she said.  \u201cI\u2019m literally driving right now my son to school because he missed the bus, and we are just miles away from the mosque where the   hijackers preached, where they prayed, where Anwar   preached. This is a reality around each one of us and all of our communities,\u201d she warned. \u201cWe have to stand strong with, I believe, compassion and kindness against the reality of this threat. That\u2019s what I saw on this tour. It turned my stomach at points, absolutely. Saudi Arabia is the problem. But it also, unfortunately, has to be the solution. We have to negotiate in a way that they will come to the table and accept responsibility for the scourge that they\u2019ve put out in the world,\u201d Nomani urged.
