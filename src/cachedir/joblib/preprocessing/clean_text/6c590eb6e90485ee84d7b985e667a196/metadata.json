[\u201cI\u2019ve long taken the view we should be deeply intolerant of sharia law,\u201d the former UKIP leader told Australia\u2019s ABC News.  \u201cBut I\u2019ve also long taken the view, that if you go down the route of say in The Netherlands, who says he wants in that country for all the mosques to be closed for the Quran to be banned and for an entire religion to be outlawed, then we will lose. \u201d He said such policies will \u201calienate the 80 per cent who are with us\u201d adding: \u201cWe have got to try to get [moderate Muslims] on our side. \u201d Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom, argues that there is little distinction between Islamism, radical Islam, and mainstream Muslim beliefs. Mr. Farage, however, said the difference in the spectrum of Islamic beliefs is great  \u2014   larger than that between moderate Muslim beliefs and Western belief systems. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest: this division, actually, is in some ways less between the Muslim and the Christian community, than it is a division within the Muslim community,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a percentage of people within the Muslim faith in this country who have sympathy with [Islamic State] but the vast majority don\u2019t,\u201d he added. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) March 26, 2017,  Mr. Farage also defended his statement that the Westminster terror attack was further evidence of the need for a temporary travel ban from some   states. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem already, why on earth would you add to it?\u201d he said. \u201cI want us to have extreme vetting. Of course, why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d The Westminster attacker was indeed born in the UK, but a travel ban \u201cmight stop the next one\u201d he said, However, the distinct problem of \u201c  Islamic terrorism\u201d and radicalisation happening in schools, prisons, and online must also be tackled, he said. \u201cWe have been, franking, cowardly with dealing with the divisions within out communities,\u201d Mr. Farage said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of this failed doctrine of multiculturalism. What that meant, is that we have encouraged division within our communities rather than integration and unity. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562120.3636847}
