But here, not even that is a given. When a fire started late Tuesday night in the maternity wing of one of Baghdad\u2019s main hospitals, it quickly engulfed the babies\u2019 room. And then, in another Iraqi tragedy in a horrifying line of preventable ones, nothing worked. Hospital workers raced to save the infants, but no one could find the keys to unlock the nursery. Inexplicably, no nurses seemed to be inside. Apparently, none of the fire extinguishers functioned. It took nearly an hour and a half for firefighters to arrive. Some thought the initial cause may have been an oxygen tank explosion that set off an electrical fire. But on Wednesday morning, only one thing was certain: At least 13 infants were dead, and with them a small piece of Iraq\u2019s future. There was Yaman Muaad, a baby boy born by cesarean section on Tuesday who died a few hours later. There was Jafar Kahtan, a baby being treated for breathing difficulties. There was Zahra Hussein, a baby girl born on Monday, whose grandfather was frantically looking for her on Wednesday. Many more were still unaccounted for. And at least 25 people, mostly infants, were being treated for burns or smoke inhalation. All Iraqi officials could manage was what they typically do in the face of tragedy: establish a committee. \u201cA committee has been formed to investigate the incident, and so far we don\u2019t know the reasons of the incident,\u201d Dr. Ahmed   a spokesman for the Health Ministry, said at a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cWe are awaiting the results of the investigations. \u201d After years of unsolved tragedy and unanswered demands for improvements, hardly anyone here believes official promises anymore. \u201cSuch tragedies have become normal to Iraqi officials, and this case will be closed, just as the other ones,\u201d said Adnan Hussein, the acting editor in chief at Al Mada, one of Baghdad\u2019s daily newspapers. In their agony and tears as they gathered outside Yarmouk hospital on Wednesday morning, families of the dead babies were inconsolable. Some even made accusations of arson, though there was no evidence to support that claim. \u201cThere was screaming,\u201d said Mariam Thijeel, the mother of Yaman, describing the scene at the hospital early Wednesday. \u201cThe power was cut off, and then the doors got locked on us, and there was no man in the newborn section, and we could not save any babies. \u201d She described a scene of panic and chaos, and said that people in the hospital had tried desperately to find someone with keys to the hospital wing that was on fire, the doors of which were locked. \u201cWe asked the help of one of the employees, but she said, \u2018I cannot help you with anything, because it\u2019s a fire,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Thijeel said. Zainab Ali, Jafar\u2019s mother, said: \u201cToday I have come to see him and I was told, \u2018A fire happened in the newborn unit, and your baby died. \u2019\u201d She said she had heard that none of the fire extinguishers worked. A third mother, Shayma Husain, came to the hospital looking for her infant son, Haider Mohammad Azeez, who had not been accounted for. Angry and tearful, she compared the leaders of the   hospital to the militants of the Islamic State  \u2014   saying, in effect, that politicians and terrorists were both responsible for Iraq\u2019s endless trauma. Painful reminders of the Iraqi state\u2019s degradation are all around. The United States spent tens of billions of dollars of reconstruction money in Iraq to build hospitals and schools and improve electricity. Yet the lights are on just a few hours a day from the public grid. Generators, if Iraqis can afford them, provide the rest. Hospitals are facing deprivation not seen since the economic sanctions of the 1990s, in part because plummeting oil prices have left the government impoverished in the middle of a war against the Islamic State. \u201cThe structure of the system of the state is wrongly built, and there is no seriousness in building state institutions,\u201d said Ahmed Saadawi, a prominent writer who chronicled Baghdad\u2019s tragedies in his prizewinning novel, \u201cFrankenstein in Baghdad. \u201d Many Iraqis say the state\u2019s dysfunction is caused by a political system the Americans helped establish that is based on sectarian quotas. People are given jobs in ministries based on patronage and sect, not competence, and corruption is rampant. And then bad things happen, like a fire breaking out in a hospital maternity ward and terrorists driving car bombs through checkpoints staffed by police officers with fake bomb detectors. \u201cWe have good medical competence and good doctors, but there are problems and defects in the state administration,\u201d Mr. Saadawi said. \u201cThey always put the wrong people in the important places. \u201d The last big news out of Iraq was a devastating truck bomb last month in Baghdad that killed close to 300 people, the worst terrorist attack in the capital since the American invasion of 2003. The bombing set off an inferno that engulfed a shopping mall where families and young people were celebrating one of the last nights of the holy month of Ramadan  \u2014   eating with friends, shopping, watching a big soccer game on television. In that attack, many more died from the fire than from the bomb blast, and in the aftermath officials blamed poor safety procedures and a lack of fire exits for the number of deaths. Like the bombing, the fire at the hospital would probably have been less deadly had the government put in place adequate safety measures or responded sooner. \u201cI was at the incident today and saw the disaster with my own eyes,\u201d said Mohammed   a member of the security committee on Baghdad\u2019s provincial council. \u201cThere was clear negligence from the administration of the hospital, and there were no safety measures. \u201d There were no protests in Baghdad on Wednesday as there were after last month\u2019s terrorist attack, only muted outrage and a tragic sense of familiarity. One man, Mohammed Sameer, wrote on Facebook, \u201cA crime after a crime, death followed by death, and the government keeps silent. \u201d He added, \u201cOh my God, what a big crime today. \u201d There was also the usual violence on Tuesday and Wednesday, the sort that has long been a feature of the city\u2019s routines. According to the Interior Ministry, a suicide car bombing at a checkpoint in the neighborhood of Dora killed four soldiers and injured 11 people a roadside bomb killed four people at a public market in the Nahrawan district and a suicide bomber killed four soldiers in the Rasheed district. As Mr. Hussein, the newspaper editor, put it: There is \u201cno safe place in Iraq at all. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562661.6643612}
