Through a combination of adrenaline, dieting and   exercise, they will walk the aisle as slim and buff as they will most likely ever be. That is, some say, unless they get divorced. For a lot of people, the divorce process seems to kick up stress hormones and motivations quite similar to those swirling around the body and psyche when a marriage ceremony draws near. \u201cIt goes to your guts, literally,\u201d said Julie Worden, a yoga teacher in Brooklyn who divorced in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s almost the same feeling as falling in love. It\u2019s the butterflies. \u201d Ms. Worden, 43, a former dancer, lost 15 pounds during her divorce. \u201cThe body goes through this emotional stress, higher levels of cortisol,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were times I couldn\u2019t eat because I couldn\u2019t break food down. \u201d Something similar happened to Astrid Swan, 34, a fitness expert in Los Angeles. \u201cOne day I put on a pair of jeggings and they were baggy,\u201d she said. At first she was thrilled, she recalled, because as a former model who was always being told to lose weight, she could \u201cnow walk the runways in Milan. \u201d But as a trainer, she knew that her low weight, and the pain involved with how she achieved it, was unsustainable. \u201cI took some time to celebrate, and then the next month I was like, \u2018O. K. this is a problem. \u2019\u201d Alison Rona, 53, an interior designer and architectural consultant who lives in Brooklyn, also felt conflicted about her new figure. It pleased her, as a sort of \u201cbonus,\u201d she recalled, and yet she felt uninspired to do anything about it, like buy new clothes or date. \u201cIt felt a little false, that inside I was still hurting so much. Physically I had a body to show off but I didn\u2019t have the confidence, because I was still so distraught by what had happened. \u201d Often called \u201cthe divorce diet,\u201d which most recently got a celebrity   by the country singer Blake Shelton, who slimmed down after he split from the singer Miranda Lambert, the   regimen is really nothing more than stress, rage, sadness, and (for some) a need to control any part of their lives  \u2014   through diet, exercise, or both  \u2014   that hasn\u2019t fallen into complete chaos. Rachel Sussman, a relationship expert and author of \u201cThe Breakup Bible,\u201d said she sees upward of 70 percent of people going through divorce or breakups growing extremely thin. \u201cThen when they start feeling better, at least 50 percent of those people want to keep that weight off,\u201d she said. James J. Sexton, a divorce lawyer in Manhattan and Rockland County, N. Y. estimated that about 80 percent of his clients have lost weight,   of them through exercise, and the others because they weren\u2019t eating or were depressed. When Mr. Sexton went through his own divorce at age 36, he turned to intense exercise, practicing Bikram yoga six days a week. \u201cIt became something that stabilized me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the ground has fallen out from beneath you, where you sleep, your children are gone, where you live, exercise is a form of religion, there\u2019s a routine and predictability to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a scary world and in a scary time of your life, it\u2019s wonderful to have it. \u201d \u201cYou can drink and you can take Xanax or you can join SoulCycle,\u201d he said. Those with compromised metabolisms or who eat their feelings may not have much sympathy for skinnier people under divorce duress, but losing one\u2019s appetite can turn into something serious. Ms. Sussman warns of the divorce diet becoming a gateway to eating disorders, and that those going through divorce need calories and protein to keep their cognitive abilities functioning when they are negotiating important legal issues. Ms. Swan, the fitness expert, said she was so disoriented by her divorce that she had to force herself to eat. \u201cI had to remind myself, \u2018You\u2019re going to go and you\u2019re going to get that sandwich,\u2019\u201d she said. But she also believes that exercise, even for those who are underweight or who have lost their appetites, is the best cure. \u201cAfter a workout, you are craving a replenishment, your muscles know you need it,\u201d she said, \u201cnot to mention endorphins, your time, your focus. \u201d Ms. Worden, the dancer, got certified in Kundalini yoga to get her strength back and to improve her   she said. She now teachers a class specifically for divorced women called Sustaining the Groove to \u201cclear out the nervous system of the yucks,\u201d she said. Already thin, Ms. Worden gained back the 15 pounds she had lost within a year. But she said that many of her students had lost weight in her class and were happy to keep it off. \u201cYou\u2019re so concerned with clearing out the rage that it happens without you even knowing it,\u201d she said. Mark Fisher, who owns a gym in midtown Manhattan, agrees that exercise is crucial during \u201cthis time of disruption,\u201d but warns against exercising too hard, which can compound the stress even further. \u201cMost people would benefit from having movement that the body doesn\u2019t perceive as a wartime scenario,\u201d like yoga, he said. \u201cWe tend to like these workouts that take us to the limit, but these other softer workouts calm the body, the nervous system. \u201d Going through a divorce, like getting married, is often about entering a new life phase. And many women, said Cynthia Sass, a nutritionist and author in Manhattan, take that idea and run with it. \u201cIn many marriages, spouses become each other\u2019s partners in crime by eating unhealthily together, including patterns like splitting pizzas, sharing pints of ice cream, snacking while watching TV,\u201d she said. Ms. Sass said that many of her clients have told her that they have no desire to return to their old, unhealthy ways once they are single again. \u201cDivorce can be a real opportunity for positive, healthy transformation,\u201d she said. Jessica Rojas, a    buyer for Est\u00e9e Lauder, certainly sees it that way. After a rocky divorce in 2013 (\u201cI would rather lose a limb than go through that again\u201d) Ms. Rojas started Snatched in Six Weeks, an exercise and nutrition program at Mr. Fisher\u2019s gym. \u201cI could barely do a   on my knees,\u201d she said about her   state. Mr. Fisher\u2019s   community of \u201cmisfits, nerds, outcasts, and Broadway geeks\u201d cheered her on, she said, and after Snatched ended, she continued to work out there, enjoying the positive energy at the gym. Within a few months, she said, she went from a \u201cflabby size 8 with a corporate commuter look\u201d to a size 2. \u201cThat was the one thing I could have control over at that moment,\u201d Ms. Rojas said. \u201cI was in a fight for my life. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to get hot, I\u2019m going to get the guy I want, I\u2019m going to get the things I want out of life,\u201d she recalled herself thinking. It worked. Last fall she locked eyes with Tim Kosakowski, 40, an old friend who works in wildlife management, at their 20th high school reunion in Easton, Pa. She fell for him immediately. On June 25, Ms. Rojas\u2019s 40th birthday, she and Mr. Kosakowski were married under a gazebo at his home, which they now share, in Washington Township, N. J.'"}, "time": 1742562048.7870307}
