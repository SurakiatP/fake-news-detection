In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We\u2019ve become a lunatic asylum.\u201d \\nMany people are confused as to what a false flag attack entails. A commonly held misperception is that there is no actual incident/event and it was all staged, but this definition is critically flawed, as a false flag attack actually describes a covert operation that is designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them. \\nAn example of a false flag attack is Operation Northwoods, which was a proposed operation against the Cuban government that originated within the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the United States government in 1962. The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other U.S. government operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American civilians and military targets, blaming it on the Cuban government, and using it to justify a war against Cuba. The proposals made it all the way to the president\u2019s desk, where they were rejected by John F. Kennedy. \\nMany people believe the attacks of 9/11 to be a false flag event, perhaps orchestrated by U.S. intelligence services or an entity that operates above the level of government entities (commonly referred to as the deep state/military industrial complex.) \\nThe alleged purpose of this false flag attack was to justify the invasion of other countries, and usher in a heightened state of \u201cnational security,\u201d precipitating the curtailing of civil liberties in the name of \u201csafety.\u201d \\nIn turn, the citizens of a state falsely believe that engaging in murderous wars are wholly justified and gladly accept new and intrusive security measures to protect the society. This often results in a false sense of patriotism that people have been indoctrinated into believing due to their skewed perception of reality. Subsequently, men and women join the military machine with good hearts, believing that they are serving in the name of freedom and fighting terrorism \u2014 when what they are actually doing is the complete opposite. \\n\u201cThe truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the \u2018devil\u2019 only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.\u201d \u2013 Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook. \\nThe reality is that people are participating in fabricated wars based on lies and misinformation sold to the public as truth.

You should be ashamed of yourself, that you even call yourself an \u201cAmerican\u201d is absolutely resentfully disgusting. gininitaly \\n2016 to date 70 cops supposedly killed in the line of \u2018duty\u2019 while 863 of all races were killed by the thugs in blue.

Carolyn Pearl \\nHad you thought to do any research, even Wikipedia, you\u2019d find that Operation Northwoods was a genuine psy-ops plan that involved, amongst other things, creating terrorist incidents within the USA which would give us an excuse to invade Cuba. Several other Operations were aligned with it, including plans to blow up a jet, use terrorism in Florida and on our own naval bases. If you\u2019re going to be naive that\u2019s your choice, but I\u2019d personally rather face the possibility of a different truth than what we\u2019re spoon fed. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods Nite_Owl \\nThe US government and military have plans for everything. They have plans for the stupidest things you could possibly think of from repelling Martian invasion fleets to attacking and occupying every country on earth including their closest friends. See The Men Who Stare at Goats for an amusing look at one of their better plans.Staring at goats to try and kill them and yes you funded that. The truth is they\u2019re mostly all clinically insane and shouldn\u2019t even be allowed near matches let alone a whole fucking country\u2019s people and resources but here we are.
