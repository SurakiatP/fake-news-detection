S. refugee program, with the German foreign minister noting that loving thy neighbor forms part of America\u2019s Christian traditions. [After meeting Saturday, the foreign ministers of both nations,   Ayrault and Germany\u2019s Sigmar Gabriel, said they want to meet with Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state who is still awaiting confirmation.  Ayrault said Trump\u2019s order on Friday that bars all refugees from entering the United States for four months  \u2014   and those from   Syria indefinitely  \u2014   \u201ccan only worry us. \u201d \u201cThere are many other issues that worry us,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is why Sigmar and I also discussed what we are going to do. When our colleague, Tillerson, is officially appointed, we will both contact him. \u201d Gabriel  \u2014   on his first trip abroad since his appointment Friday  \u2014   said offering refuge to the persecuted and those fleeing death are western values that Europe and the United States share. \u201cLove thy neighbor is part of this tradition, the act of helping others,\u201d he said. \u201cThis unites us, we Westerners. And I think that this remains a common foundation that we share with the United States, one we aim to promote. \u201d Trump declared the ban necessary to prevent \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from entering the United States. The order immediately suspended a program that last year resettled to the U. S. roughly 85, 000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice.'"}, "time": 1742562500.4716265}
