Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/renowned-harvard-psychologist-says-adhd.html Viewed by academics as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century, Jerome Kagan ranked above Carl Jung (the founder of analytical psychology) and Ivan Pavlov (who discovered the Pavlovian reflex) in a 2002 American Psychological Association ranking of the eminent psychologists. He is well-known for his pioneering work in developmental psychology at Harvard University, where he has spent decades documenting how babies and small children grow, and is an exceptional and highly-regarded researcher.So it may be surprising to learn that he believes the diagnosis of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is an invention \u2014 and only benefits the pharmaceutical industry and psychiatrists. Mislabeling Mental Illness \u201cThat is the history of humanity: Those in authority believe they\u2019re doing the right thing, and they harm those who have no power,\u201d says Jerome Kagan.In an interview with Spiegel, Kagan addressed the skyrocketing rates of ADHD in America , which he attributes to \u201cfuzzy diagnostic practices.\u201d He illustrated his point with the following example:Say fifty years ago you have a 7-year-old who is bored in school and exhibits disruptive behavior. Back then, he would be labeled as lazy. But today, that same child is said to suffer from ADHD . That\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen such a dramatic increase in the disorder.Every child who is having problems in school is sent to see a pediatrician, who then claims it\u2019s ADHD and prescribes Ritalin . \u201cIn fact, 90 percent of these 5.4 million kids don\u2019t have an abnormal dopamine metabolism. The problem is, if a drug is available to doctors, they\u2019ll make the corresponding diagnosis,\u201d he said.\u201cWe could get philosophical and ask ourselves: \u201cWhat does mental illness mean?\u201d If you do interviews with children and adolescents aged 12 to 19, then 40 percent can be categorized as anxious or depressed. \u201cBut if you take a closer look and ask how many of them are seriously impaired by this, the number shrinks to 8 percent. Describing every child who is depressed or anxious as being mentally ill is ridiculous. \u201cAdolescents are anxious, that\u2019s normal. They don\u2019t know what college to go to. Their boyfriend or girlfriend just stood them up. Being sad or anxious is just as much a part of life as anger or sexual frustration,\u201d Kagan told Spiegel.What are the implications for the millions of American children who are inaccurately diagnosed as mentally ill? Kagan believes it\u2019s devastating because they think there is something fundamentally wrong with them. He\u2019s not the only psychologist to raise the alarm about this trend, but Kagan and others feel they\u2019re up against \u201can enormously powerful alliance: pharmaceutical companies that are making billions , and a profession that is self-interested.\u201dKagan himself suffered from inner restlessness and stuttering as a child, but his mother told him: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you. Your mind is working faster than your tongue.\u201dHe thought at the time: \u201cGee, that\u2019s great, I\u2019m only stuttering because I\u2019m so smart.\u201d If he had been born in the present era, he most likely would have been classified as mentally ill.ADHD isn\u2019t the only mental illness epidemic among children that worries Kagan, depression is another. In 1987, about one in 400 American teenagers was using an antidepressant. By 2002, the numbers leaped to one in 40. He feels it\u2019s another overused diagnosis, simply because the pills are available. Instead of immediately resorting to pharmaceutical drugs, he thinks doctors should take more time with the child to find out why they aren\u2019t as cheerful, for instance. At the very least, a few tests should be carried out \u2014 and an EEG for certain, especially since studies have shown that people who have heightened activity in the right frontal lobe respond poorly to antidepressants.Kagan remembers going into a textbook-type depression after a major research project he was involved with failed. He had insomnia and met all the other clinical criteria for depression. But since he knew what the cause was, he didn\u2019t seek professional help. After six months, the depression was gone. Under normal circumstances, he would have been diagnosed as mentally ill by a psychiatrist and put on medication.
