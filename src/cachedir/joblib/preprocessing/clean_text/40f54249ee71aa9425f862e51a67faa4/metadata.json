[Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker made the declaration after meeting British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who said he was confident the UK would be \u201cfirst in line\u201d for such a trade deal, the BBC reports.  The strong statements come after outgoing President Obama travelled to the UK during the European Union (EU) referendum campaign to threaten the British people that they would be at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d for a deal if the voted to Leave. Mr. Corker said Mr. Johnson knows \u201cfull well\u201d that \u201cthere is no way the United Kingdom is going to take a back seat\u201d. \u201cThey will take a front seat and I think it will be our priority to make sure that we deal with them on a trade agreement initially but in all respects in a way that demonstrates the   friendship that we\u2019ve had for so long,\u201d he said. . @BorisJohnson joins us in Washington to discuss   @realDonaldTrump and the future of the #SpecialRelationship. pic. twitter.   \u2014   British Embassy (@UKinUSA) January 9, 2017,  \u201cClearly, the Trump    has a very exciting agenda of change,\u201d Mr. Johnson added. \u201cOne thing that won\u2019t change though is the closeness of the relationship between the U.

We are America\u2019s principal partner in working for global security and, of course, we are great campaigners for free trade. \u201cWe hear that we are first in line to do a great   deal with the United States.
