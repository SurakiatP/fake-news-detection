[The United Kingdom officially filed to leave the European Union on Wednesday, and the   rocker says he supports Brexit because a \u201cmajority of this country felt that their voices weren\u2019t being heard. \u201d  \u201cWe are getting out, and when the dust settles I think that it\u2019ll be seen that it\u2019s the right thing for this country to have done, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Daltrey told NME. \u201cI am not   but I am anti the present way we are being governed in Europe,\u201d Daltrey explained \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with any of the immigration issues or any of that for me. It was to do with much more. The majority of this country felt that their voices weren\u2019t being heard. It would have been nice to do a deal with Europe but they didn\u2019t want to do a deal, and they sent Cameron back with a bag. \u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m sad we voted how we voted, but I think we have to go with it now. This country will always be alright, I don\u2019t worry about it. You know it\u2019s going to be bumpy on the way \u2014  we expected that the ones that voted to get out. But Iceland had it a bit bumpy when they went bankrupt, but oh not now. \u201d Daltrey previously expressed support for Brexit in May, saying the European Union was \u201cset up by a bunch of crooks\u201d and was \u201cundemocratic\u201d and \u201chighly dysfunctional. \u201d When it comes to U. S. politics and the 2016 presidential election, the \u201cMy Generation\u201d singer said he believes \u201ca dead dog could have beaten\u201d Democratic contender Hillary Clinton. \u201cOn other pieces of politics, let\u2019s put it this way: when you say that middle America and the Democrats lost it, but Trump didn\u2019t really win it because Democrats threw it away by putting [Hilary Clinton] up,\u201d Daltrey told NME. \u201cA dead dog would have won it against [her] look at that. \u201d The   also took a shot at Trump\u2019s hair and language: \u201cHe needs it cut and as my mother would say, \u2018wash your f*cking mouth out. \u2019\u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742562534.397791}
