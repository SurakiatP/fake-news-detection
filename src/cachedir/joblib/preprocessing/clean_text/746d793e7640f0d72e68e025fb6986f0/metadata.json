The government, against all odds, bravely negotiated until the 11th hour and saved us from total chaos as garda\u00ed agreed to cancel strike action. \\nCrowds lined the streets late last night to cheer on the government as they made their way down O\u2019Connell St in an open top bus, waving to the crowds invoking memories of the Italia 90 homecoming. \\nA dire situation that was totally not of the government\u2019s own making, Enda Kenny and his cabinet rescued defeat from the jaws of victory and relabelled it, but how? What offer was placed on the table for the 10,000 plus guards who were ready to withdraw their labour? \\nWWN sources have furnished us with a complete copy of all that was offered to the guards to avert strike action, and we have the offer listed below: \\n1) 8 government piggy banks (the government promise the use of piggy banks was not meant to be derogatory) which can be smashed open by garda\u00ed with a hammer. The exact contents of them are unknown, but after shaking them and holding them to their ears, GRA representatives were said to be \u2018excited\u2019. \\n2) A guard will be picked via lottery system and given the chance to use a taser on Leo Varadkar. The Taoiseach was adamant this was included in the deal despite it not being among the GRA\u2019s demands. \\n3) One new uniform per station, to be worn by officers on a rotation basis. \\n4) A pat on the back from the government every month with a variation of the phrase \u2018well done\u2019 to accompany it. \\n5) Vague agreement to provide resources to upgrade the force from the 1870s to at least 1960s standards by 2050. \\n6) \u20ac15 premium payment on annual leave but all garda\u00ed will be forced to holiday in a caravan park in Wicklow. \\n7) Free team bonding trip to Tayto Park, and tickets to the Late Late Toy Show for all 12,500 garda\u00ed who were set to strike on the condition that the GRA tell the public that the government are \u2018the best\u2019. \\n8) 100% mortgages and free pints in exchange for arresting at least one opposition TD on drink driving charges. \\n9) An increase of 4 cents per year in the shoelace allowance if garda\u00ed turn a blind eye to Simon Harris\u2019s burgeoning Crystal Meth empire. \\n10) Garda\u00ed will agree to unpaid overtime if the government admit NASA has conclusively proven Fiscal Space is a myth. \\n11) Garda\u00ed will be given one extra day of annual leave if they agree not to spoil the most recent of season of Game of Thrones as Frances Fitzgerald is only on season 3. \\n12) Once Garda\u00ed approve the deal, both sides have agreed to paper over the cracks and carry on as normal.'"}, "time": 1742563788.0386093}
