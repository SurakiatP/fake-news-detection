[Mann used often to claim that he was a Nobel Prizewinner  \u2014   till someone unhelpfully pointed out that he was but one of hundreds of scientists who contributed to Assessment Reports by the IPCC (which did win the Nobel Prize in 2007)  This week the   shyster was up to his old tricks again, telling a string of porkie pies at a climate science hearing of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Given how litigious the mendacious, bloviating poltroon can be  \u2014   he\u2019s currently engaged in at least two defamation suits: one against Tim Ball, the other against Mark Steyn  \u2014   I obviously have to tread very carefully here. So I\u2019d just like to say, as delicately and politely as I can to the Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State University: \u201cLiar, liar. Your pants on fire. \u201d Here\u2019s the evidence: Porkie Number One, Mann told the Congressional hearing he had no association or affiliation with the Climate Accountability Institute (one of the numerous ad hoc organisations formed in order to give the harassment of climate sceptics an air of scientific credibility). Yet according to his CV he sits on the Climate Accountability Institute\u2019s advisory board and has done since 2014. Porkie Number Two, Mann denied having called his fellow climate scientist and special witness, former Georgia Tech Judith Curry, a \u201cdenier\u201d. \u201cA number of statements have been attributed to me. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve called anybody a denier,\u201d he solemnly told the hearing. To which Judith Curry, sitting next to him, replied: \u201cIt\u2019s in your written testimony. Go read it again. \u201d You can watch the moment where Curry smacks him down below: Mann then proceeded indignantly to quibble that though he might have called Curry a \u201cclimate science denier\u201d he hadn\u2019t called her a \u201cclimate change denier\u201d. [As if there\u2019s any meaningful distinction between the two slurs]. But this claim  \u2014   as Stephen McIntyre notes  \u2014   was also a lie. confronted with written evidence that he called Curry \u201cclimate science denier\u201d Mann said he hadnt called her \u201cclimate CHANGE denier\u201d. #FAKE pic. twitter.   \u2014   Stephen McIntyre (@ClimateAudit) March 29, 2017,  Porkie Number Three, Mann  \u2014   busily trying to develop the case that climate scientists like himself are the innocent victims of vicious slurs  \u2014   was asked whether he\u2019d ever dismissed another of the expert witnesses on the panel, Roger Pielke Jr with the phrase \u201ccarnival barker\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d have to provide me with the context. I don\u2019t remember everything I have said or done,\u201d said Mann. Here\u2019s one example: Mann said that he didn\u2019t remember calling @RogerPielkeJr a \u201ccarnival barker\u201d. But https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Stephen McIntyre (@ClimateAudit) March 29, 2017,  And here\u2019s Mann again using the insult  \u2014   clearly a personal favourite  \u2014   on Judith Curry: Mann also called @curryja a \u201ccarnival barker\u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Stephen McIntyre (@ClimateAudit) March 29, 2017,  Porkie Number Four, Mann, in yet another bid to present himself as a persecuted martyr of   Republicans, claimed that Joe Barton  \u2014   the Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee  \u2014   had demanded all his \u201cpersonal emails and correspondence with other scientists. \u201d This, again, was a lie. Barton had asked for Mann\u2019s funding sources  \u2014   which Mann, in his congressional testimony, said was fair game  \u2014   but not for his personal emails. Here, once again, Steve McIntyre has the evidence. Mann: #fake claim tht Barton demanded \u201call of my personal emails and correspondence\u201d. Barton: funding info, which Mann said \u201cfair game\u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Stephen McIntyre (@ClimateAudit) March 29, 2017,  Michael Mann claims to be an expert on climate change and is frequently called on by official panels like this Congressional committee to speak on behalf of the scientific establishment. Is there anyone who still takes this guy seriously?'"}, "time": 1742563697.8291492}
