And, fittingly, it has now become one. The director of \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d was drawn to \u201cMiss Peregrine\u201d (in theaters Sept. 30) because it fell in line with the themes he often explores: misfits struggling to be understood and tales that blend the comic and the tragic. The \u201cPeculiar Children\u201d of the title possess special abilities, like the power to reanimate dead creatures or shoot fire from their fingers. For this story of a teenage boy (Asa Butterfield) who uncovers a family mystery that involves a handful of those children, invisible monsters known as Hollows, and time travel, Mr. Riggs built his narrative around vintage photographs he collected. \u201cI liked Ransom\u2019s approach with the pictures,\u201d Mr. Burton said in a phone interview from Los Angeles. \u201cIt was an interesting kind of way to create a story. It made it feel like a weird old fable. \u201d For the production, Mr. Burton sketched characters, props and more. Here, he explains why he decided to put clothes on evil creatures and how he came to storyboard a feast of human eyeballs. This is Hugh (Milo Parker) a Peculiar who has a wild hive of bees living inside of him. Mr. Burton\u2019s simple sketch shows the intensity of the character using only dots to illustrate the bees. \u201cI didn\u2019t do too many sketches of the kids because I didn\u2019t want to do three drawings and try to cast the kids to look like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was just a little more my process, my doodles really,\u201d Mr. Burton said. \u201cDoodling these little things helps me to get thoughts from the inside out. \u201d These creatures are the biggest threat to Peculiars, and all the more menacing because they are invisible to most everyone. In his sketch, Mr. Burton incorporated mouth tentacles and other traits described in the novel but also put his stamp on this lanky figure, which could be at home in his films \u201cThe Nightmare Before Christmas\u201d or \u201cCorpse Bride. \u201d \u201cOriginally, we were doing things that felt too much like monsters,\u201d he said. \u201cI got back to the idea that they should have a human quality. That made it feel more like a folk tale kind of children\u2019s horror story. So I kept clothes on them so they had a human aspect to them. \u201d This scene is from an experiment conducted by the creepy villain, Barron (Samuel L. Jackson) who has evolved from a Hollow and is trying to achieve immortality. The helmet has a sinister, torturous medieval yet industrial look that Mr. Burton came up with after earlier designs left him dissatisfied. \u201cI had a lot of artists working on things, and the helmets were looking overly elaborate, overly cartoonish, like from an old Disney movie,\u201d Mr. Burton said. \u201cBut I thought there was something a bit more weird and scary about a more simple helmet. This riveted simplicity felt kind of cultish to me. \u201d To become more humanlike, Barron must eat human eyeballs. In one scene, he and other former Hollows enjoy an eyeball feast. It\u2019s a grisly, but also a kind of funny, visual set piece that gets at the children\u2019s nightmare spirit of the novel. Mr. Burton\u2019s simple watercolor drawing helped realize this moment. And while he doesn\u2019t make as many storyboards for his movies as he used to, they were necessary in this case. \u201cWe had to do this scene in a montage kind of a way,\u201d Mr. Burton said, \u201cso it is one sequence that helped to storyboard. \u201d In the end, though the feast\u2019s vibe is lifted from in the book, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not as literal as what we ended up with. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563857.589508}
