You\u2019re the enemy! You\u2019re the ones working for the devil!,\u201d before adapting the crowd\u2019s \u201cUSA\u201d chant into \u201cJew-s-a,\u201d all the while continuing to scream at the members of the media in the press pen. \\nCandace Smith, of ABC, was one of the reporters to capture the man\u2019s disturbing behavior on tape. She posted video of the disturbing press area encounter to Twitter, a video which is featured below. This is the man who started chanting \u201cJEW-S-A\u201d at the media pen. Does anyone know what those hands signs mean? pic.twitter.com/64yseZFSVZ \\n\u2014 Candace Smith (@CandaceSmith_) October 29, 2016 \\nSmith included in the text accompanying her video post a question, saying in reference to seemingly intentional hand gestures on the part of the Trump supporter, \u201cDoes anyone know what those hand signs mean?\u201d \\nSmith got at least a couple noteworthy and credible responses. \\nClayton Swisher, whose Twitter bio reads that he is an \u201cinvestigative reporter and author,\u201d suggested that the Trump supporter\u2019s hand gestures are a variation of the \u201c88\u201d hand sign used by white supremacists and described by the Anti-Defamation League as follows: \\n\u2018One of the most popular white supremacist symbols is the numeric symbol 88, which stands for \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d (substituting letters for numbers, 88 means HH, i.e., \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d). It is thus not surprising that white supremacists occasionally attempt to display 88 as a hand sign.\u2019 \\n\u2014 Clayton Swisher (@claytonswisher) October 30, 2016 \\nA Twitter user identified as Marisel Morales suggested that the hand gestures were the \u201cScwhurhand,\u201d which is a German salute used in court. @CandaceSmith_ It's a German salute known as Schwurhand \\n\u2014 Marisel Morales (@57MCM) October 29, 2016 \\nA Twitter user with the username \u201c@puppymnkey\u201d countered, however, that the Trump supporter\u2019s hand gestures didn\u2019t quite match the Schwurhand, and instead pointed to a hand gesture version of the number \u201c666\u201d employed by conspiracy theorists, a group almost certainly the man at the Trump rally. @57MCM @CandaceSmith_ nope. That salute is with pinky and index finger touching. It could be this given he's Infowars idiot pic.twitter.com/u953UYor2K \\n\u2014 Boycott Trump SCION (@puppymnkey) October 30, 2016 \\nNick Corasaniti of The New York Times was another member of the press to capture the man\u2019s disturbing behavior on film. \\nHis video, which runs a bit after Smith\u2019s video concludes, is featured below. \\nIn this second video, the man can be heard saying that \u201cWe\u2019re run by the Jews, okay?\u201d Guy chants \u201cJew-S-A\u201d in front of press pen pic.twitter.com/2yqgA6dD4k \\n\u2014 Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) October 29, 2016 \\nAt the same rally, Politico\u2019s Ben Schrekinger captured an image of a man he said \u201chad been staring at the press for some time\u201d and was \u201cholding an object.\u201d \\nSecurity, Schrekinger says, was notified of the man\u2019s behavior. Bearded man's been staring at press for some time. Television reporter said he is holding object + notified security pic.twitter.com/phDvXFGgGw \\n\u2014 Ben Schreckinger (@SchreckReports) October 29, 2016 \\nTrump has long targeted the press in his incitement antics, as put on full display in his campaign rallies. He claims that the media has collaborated to \u201crig\u201d the election against him by supposedly dishonest coverage of his campaign on their part. \""}, "time": 1742562481.4939635}
