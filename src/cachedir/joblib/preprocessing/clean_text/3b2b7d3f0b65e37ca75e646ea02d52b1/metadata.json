Take The Test Video December 11, 2012 124 Comments Masculinity \\nThere\u2019s a lot of guys who claim to haven taken the red pill, but I suspect there is a sea of blue still swirling within their core. To find out if that\u2019s you, watch the following three portions of the above video: \\n0:47 \u2013 0:53 2:24 \u2013 2:31 \\nTime to grade the test: \\n1. Did you think what you just witnessed was the most heart-warming thing in the world? If yes, you\u2019re drowning in blue pill. \\n2. Do you wish you could have a female friend like the Indian man in the video? If yes, you\u2019re still blue pill. \\n3. Did you think there\u2019s nothing wrong with being friends with a girl? If yes, you\u2019re bluer than the ocean. \\n4. Did you run to the nearest bathroom and throw up in the toilet at his display of supreme betatude? If yes, you\u2019re red pill. \\n5. Did you viscerally cringe and actually get angry at the world when the girl said, \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend in the world, and you always will be\u201d while the beta withheld his tears of emotion? If yes, you\u2019re blood pill! \\nOne problem with swallowing the red pill is that you will get offended at just about everything that mainstream people enjoy. You can no longer digest their media, enjoy their viral videos, or even have a normal conversation with a blue piller. You form your own red pill bubble, whether it\u2019s frequenting sites on the manosphere , not dating women from blue pill societies, or outright expatriating to countries where men are rewarded for being masculine. Long live the red pill! \\nP.S. I make an appearance at 2:24.'"}, "time": 1742562207.025257}
