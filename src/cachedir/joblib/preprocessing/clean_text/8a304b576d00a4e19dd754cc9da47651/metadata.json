[The diamond, known as the \u201cPink Star,\u201d sold for $71. 2 million at Sotheby\u2019s auction house in Hong Kong, the Associated Press reported.  The oval, mixed cut diamond surpassed Sotheby\u2019s   estimate of $60 million. The gem was sold for $83 million at another Sotheby\u2019s auction in Geneva, but the buyer defaulted and the purchase never went through. The jewel is the largest pink diamond ever graded by the Gemological Institute of America. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy,\u201d said Sotheby\u2019s Asia Chairwoman Patti Wong. Wong identified the winning bidder as Hong Kong jewelry firm Chow Tai Fook. The company\u2019s chairman, Henry Cheng   placed the winning bid over the phone, CNN Money reported. Wong said the company is not worried about a default this time because the auction house vetted the bidders, who also just so happen to have longstanding relationships with Sotheby\u2019s. The last gem to hold the record of most expensive jewel ever sold was the \u201cOppenheimer Blue,\u201d which sold for $57. 5 million at Christie\u2019s auction house in Geneva in May 2016, NBC News reported.'"}, "time": 1742628363.7428062}
