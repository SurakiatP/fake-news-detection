CLOUD, Minn.  \u2014   The man who the police say stabbed 10 people at a mall here on Saturday seemed like a model of assimilation, not a violent jihadist, people who knew him and his family said. The son of Somali refugees, he lived in the United States most of his life, did well in school, played sports, worked as a security guard and took classes at a local college. But a new description has been applied to him: terrorist. As he stalked through the Crossroads Center mall, wearing a security guard uniform and wielding a knife, the attacker, identified by officials on Monday as Dahir Adan, 20, mentioned Allah and asked at least one victim if he was Muslim, the police said. A report by a news agency linked to the Islamic State claimed on Sunday that a \u201csoldier of the Islamic State\u201d was behind the stabbing. The F. B. I. is investigating the attack as a possible terrorist act. But law enforcement officials were unsure whether Mr. Adan had made contact with any terror organization, or had \u201c\u201d heeding the online calls to radical jihad that terrorist groups have used to goad Westerners into mounting attacks at home. The St. Cloud police chief, William Blair Anderson, stressed that the investigation had barely started, adding, \u201cI want to know everything about this individual since the day he was born until last Saturday. \u201d \u201cHe was a normal American kid,\u201d said Jama Alimad, a leader among St. Cloud\u2019s ethnic Somalis and a friend of the Adan family, who had seen Mr. Adan as recently as this summer. \u201cI can\u2019t see anyone more assimilated than that guy. \u201d As customers in the mall fled the attacker and rushed for the exits, the rampage ended when Mr. Adan was shot and killed inside Macy\u2019s by an   police officer. On Monday, the St. Cloud police raised the number of wounded from nine to 10, explaining that they had learned of a victim who had not immediately sought medical treatment. None of the eight men and two women who were stabbed suffered   injuries, and none remained hospitalized, officials said. The mall reopened on Monday morning. Since the attack, people who had encountered Mr. Adan have tried to reconcile the quiet,   youth they saw with the bloody accounts of his actions. People who have spoken with his family said that he had shown no signs of radicalization, and that on Saturday, he seemed to be in good spirits and said he was going to the mall to buy a new iPhone. \u201cThat\u2019s something he was hiding very well if indeed he did that,\u201d said Haji Yussuf, director of UniteCloud, a group that tries to resolve tensions between cultures in the city. Until the police release video recordings of the attack, \u201cwe cannot believe the speculation we hear,\u201d said Mohamoud Ismail Mohamed, executive director of the Saint Cloud Area Somali Salvation Organization, who said he helped the Adan family settle in St. Cloud about seven or eight years ago. \u201cWhat happened that night between leaving home and the shooting is the million dollar question. \u201d A few of Mr. Adan\u2019s friends and schoolmates took to social media to express their disbelief and confusion. One called Chammy said on Twitter, \u201cHe was such a sweet humble guy, and that\u2019s still how I see him. \u201d Abdulwahid Osman, a lawyer for the Adan family, released a statement Monday night saying that Mr. Adan\u2019s relatives wanted to express their \u201cdeepest sympathy and condolences\u201d to the injured and their prayers for recovery. \u201cAs a family, we are committed to fully cooperating, within the limits of the law, with all relevant law enforcement agencies as they conduct their investigation,\u201d the statement said. The statement also urged people \u201cnot to rush to judgment or conclusions\u201d and said \u201cour family loves St. Cloud and this state. \u201d President Obama said that he was being briefed on the Minnesota investigation, and that there was no sign of a link to explosions in and around New York City on Saturday. \u201cAt this point, we see no connection between that incident and what happened in New York and New Jersey,\u201d the president said at a news conference in New York, where he was attending the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly. Mr. Alimad said Mr. Adan had immigrated to the United States as a toddler and grew up in St. Cloud. He said Mr. Adan excelled in school, and was not especially religious, though also not an atheist. \u201cWe need to get to the bottom of this,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to know what triggered this kid. \u201d The Star Tribune in Minneapolis reported that Mr. Adan lived with his father in an apartment in St. Cloud. The father said his son was born in Kenya, where many Somalis have fled to escape the   civil war in their country. He graduated in 2014 from Apollo High School in St. Cloud, then enrolled at St. Cloud State University, intending to major in information systems, the university said, but he was not enrolled for the fall term. Mr. Adan worked part time for a global security firm, Securitas, which assigned him to weekend guard duty at an Electrolux facility in St. Cloud, according to both companies. Securitas released a brief statement saying that Mr. Adan had quit in June, offering little else about his history with the company, except that he \u201cwas hired in accordance with Minnesota state law and company policy. \u201d Family friends said he had a security guard job at the time of the attack, but it was not clear where. The attacker was stopped by Jason Falconer, an     police officer in Avon, a nearby town. \u201cHe\u2019s a firearms instructor for the City of Avon,\u201d said Corey Nellis, Avon\u2019s police chief. \u201cHe\u2019s a competitive shooter. If I was going to ask anybody to fire live rounds in a crowded mall, I would trust his abilities next to anybody\u2019s. \u201d Chief Nellis said that Mr. Falconer, a former police chief in another nearby town, Albany, worked only an occasional shift for his department in fact, he was not scheduled to work over the next two months. Minnesota is home to about 25, 000 Somalis, the largest concentration in the United States. Some have flocked in recent years to St. Cloud, a small city northwest of the Twin Cities, in search of safety and jobs, where Somali leaders say they have mostly been made to feel welcome. \u201cKnowing your neighbor makes you less fearful of your neighbor,\u201d said Mayor Dave Kleis, who said the city has worked hard to welcome and integrate the newcomers. Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat who has long been an outspoken advocate for immigrants, said at a news conference on Monday, \u201cI implore citizens of St. Cloud, and really citizens throughout Minnesota, to rise above this tragic incident and to remember our common humanity, our shared citizenship, and our shared desires to live together peacefully. \u201d But Somalis said there was a widespread fear of a backlash after the attack. \u201cWe are really fearful,\u201d Mr. Alimad said. \u201cKids are afraid. Women are afraid to go to shop. And this is happening in the land of the free. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562070.0141754}
