In that interview, Trump was reluctant to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin and for that Scarborough insisted that Trump must come out publicly and state that he opposes assassinating journalists and political rivals, as Putin has been accused of doing in the past. \u201cIf Donald Trump keeps being asked to criticize Vladimir Putin for assassinating journalists and Donald Trump refuses to criticize Vladimir Putin for assassinating journalists and say, \u2018Well, we do it too,\u2019 in a sense, does that suggest he thinks it\u2019s OK to assassinate journalists?\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cDoes that suggest he thinks it\u2019s OK to jail political opponents? To assassinate political opponents? If you don\u2019t condemn, after being repeatedly asked to condemn these actions, at some point you go back to the \u2018he who does not deny admits\u2019 story.  And it suggested he does. I suggest somebody at the White House get him to write a statement  \u2014   a very strong statement letting the world know that he condemns the assassination of journalists and political rivals because he suggests in the two interviews with O\u2019Reilly and us that he does not. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563006.1092336}
