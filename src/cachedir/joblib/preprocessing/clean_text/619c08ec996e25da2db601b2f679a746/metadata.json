Plus a remarkable look at the Kennedy and Lincoln assassinations. \\nA portion of today\u2019s note from Art Cashin: On this day in 1963, the President of the United States, John Kennedy, was fatally shot while riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas. His assassin (as you may have heard), was Lee Harvey Oswald, who fired from the Texas Schoolbook Depository. But\u2026of course\u2026you know all that! The event has been the subject of several movies, at least three national investigations, countless TV specials, a few hundred books, a million magazine articles and several theories. \\nHaving been exposed to all this, you are no doubt aware of all the trivia and oddities. There\u2019s the Kennedy/Lincoln oddity. Jack Kennedy\u2019s personal secretary was named Lincoln\u2026just as Abe Lincoln\u2019s secretary was named Kennedy. Both secretaries had pleaded with their bosses not to go to the place where they were shot. Both Presidents were succeeded by guys named Johnson. Both Johnson\u2019s were Southerners and former Senators. Both Johnson\u2019s were born 100 years apart. Kennedy and Lincoln were elected 100 years apart. John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald were born 100 years apart. Both Kennedy and Lincoln were assassinated on a Friday while sitting next to their wives. Booth shot Lincoln in a theater and tried to hide in a warehouse. Oswald was in a warehouse when he shot Kennedy, he then tried to hide in a theater. But\u2026you recall all that. \\nAnd, if you recall all that, you probably recall that it had been raining in Dallas earlier that morning. That, fearing a bad hair day, Jackie Kennedy suggested putting the bubble top on the limo. Then, when the sun came out, the Secret Service decided to skip the bubble top. \\nSo, then you also recall the reports that Oswald was considering dropping his plans the night before, but a buzz-off from the wife sent him back to his plot. Which means you certainly recall that the initial reports indicated that both the President and Vice President had been killed. And when they brought that report to Speaker John McCormack (still lunching in the House Dining Room), he froze at the thought that, at age 71, he was suddenly the President of the U.S. He froze so literally that he was unable even to stand up and only recovered when he was told LBJ was still alive. \\nOn the floor of the NYSE selling had begun before any headlines hit the tape. Months later I learned that was thanks to a savvy branch manager in Dallas. \\nSince Presidents didn\u2019t travel widely in 1963, he thought he would give much of the staff a treat by letting them go out and watch the Presidential parade. He kept a skeleton crew and sent the others out to watch the parade, which was due to pass about a block away. \\nRather shortly the gang wandered back in looking somewhat glum and disappointed. \u201cWhat happened\u201d?, asked the manager. \u201cParade got canceled\u201d mumbled one of the returnees. \\nAfter questioning, he learned that they had heard the sirens accelerate, the police lights flare and the \u201cparade\u201d suddenly turned right. They were many blocks away and obviously heard no shots. \\nThe savvy manager quickly asked \u2013 \u201cGive me a bullish reason to pull a President out of a parade?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not to sign a tax bill \u2013 that could wait.\u201d No one could think of a bullish reason to divert a parade. Then they mulled bearish reasons. No one thought assassination. But they did think natural disaster, nuclear accident, missile threat and scores of others. That\u2019s when they decided something \u201cbad\u201d must have happened and began to sell. \\nAs their sell orders poured onto the floor and prices began to melt, they were asked by brokers \u2013 \u201cWhy the selling?\u201d The response was the incomplete \u2013 \u201csomething about the President.\u201d \\nSometime later, the first headline hit \u2013 \u201cShots reported fired at President\u2019s motorcade!\u201d The selling broadened an accelerated. Rather quickly the next headline \u2013 \u201cPresident reported hit.\u201d \\nExchange leaders hastily gathered and discussed closing the Exchange. Then the headline \u201cMotorcade diverted to Parkland Hospital.\u201d They rang the bell at 2:07 (EST). \\nThe Dow fell the equivalent of what would be 460 points today. When we reopened Tuesday, there was such a sigh of relief that power had been transferred and the Constitution still functioned, that a massive rally erupted, soaring the equivalent of 710 points. An unforgettable period. \\nOvernight And Overseas \u2013 In Asia, most markets were better. Tokyo shrugged off the earthquake and closed moderately higher as did Shanghai and India. Hong Kong was sharply higher led by the Macau gang. Manila was odd man out, falling sharply, led by real estate. \\nIn Europe, the FTSE is red hot, led by mining stocks. On the continent, almost all markets are higher, but in somewhat lighter volume. \\nThe metals are percolating, with several trading \u201cup limit\u201d. The U.S. dollar is softer against the euro, the pound and even the Australian dollar. Crude soared overnight but is now backing off the highs. \\nConsensus \u2013 Let\u2019s watch crude, which reached a technical count target and has begun to ease back. A turn in the tide? Too early to tell. \\nThey are somewhat overbought but 19,000 may be too tempting a target. Stick with the drill \u2013 stay wary, alert and very, very nimble. May you and all your hold dear have your most wonderful Thanksgiving ever! \\n  Look At The Stunning Levels Of Extreme Action In Gold, Silver, U.S. Dollar And Stock Market  '"}, "time": 1742561896.0205555}
