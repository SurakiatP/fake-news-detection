Anthony Weiner ( ) Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) and Gov. David Paterson ( )  \u2014   when they came to Washington to take up their official posts in the Trump White House, according to a report in Buzzfeed. [The revelation came amid reports that a New York City set with a history of friendly ties to the Democratic party is gaining traction in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House, much to the chagrin of conservative commentators.  Members of the Kushner family itself donated large sums to Democratic causes until a few years ago, and Jared has reportedly been accused of being \u201ca Democrat\u201d by more nationalist and populist factions within the White House. Another   member of this   is the Director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, registered Democrat and former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn. Asked by Buzzfeed about her choice, Ivanka responded in a statement, \u201cRisa is incredibly talented, driven and passionate. She is a formidable advocate and respected by all as a trustworthy and honest broker of facts. \u201d Her husband Jared echoed her sentiments. \u201cShe\u2019s the best fighter in the business, is universally respected, and most importantly has always told me what she really thinks, good or bad,\u201d he said. Heller began her career in Schumer\u2019s press office before expanding her horizons in and beyond the political field. She served as communications director for David Paterson as the New York governor who replaced   Gov. Eliot Spitzer and then found himself in crises of his own. In addition to allegations of witness tampering by his appointees, Heller managed Paterson\u2019s image through the emergence of the sex and drug scandals that ultimately sunk his reelection hopes. Anthony Weiner, perpetrator of perhaps politics\u2019   most embarrassing litany of   also sought Heller\u2019s help as he tried to weather the media storm of the century that surrounded his multiple \u201csexting\u201d scandals. Now banished from the political realm, Weiner sung Heller\u2019s praises. \u201cIf I had taken her advice at critical junctures even 5% of the time, I would have been infinitely better off,\u201d he told Buzzfeed. \u201cThis may sound ironic coming from me, but she never advocates for not telling the truth. I repeatedly didn\u2019t take that kind of advice where I should have. \u201d For her own part, Buzzfeed reports Heller continued to argue Weiner was a \u201cgood person,\u201d even as the worst details of his improprieties were emblazoned on front pages around the world. Jared and Ivanka, until recently, haunted the same New York circles in which these Democratic politicians are hounded by the city\u2019s notorious tabloid press. Kushner himself has used Ms. Heller, sending her to handle the New York Times earlier this year when that paper raised questions about a deal of his in China. Anthony Weiner, for one, seemed to think she was a natural pick to help Jared and his wife in DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that people like the Kushners would gravitate toward her,\u201d he told Buzzfeed. At the beginning of April, paparazzi supplied the Daily Mail with photos of Ms. Heller heading into Jared and Ivanka\u2019s new home in Washington, DC. Some think Heller is an odd choice to bring so close to Ivanka\u2019s father\u2019s Republican administration. At least one of her own former Democrat colleagues in New York expressed horror at the move. \u201cI think there\u2019s a big difference between representing business interests and essentially helping to advance an agenda that is completely antithetical to everything that Democrats stand for,\u201d the Democratic operative told Buzzfeed. Heller was reportedly dismayed to be the subject of a Buzzfeed article, but offered a defense of her decision to work for the Kushners: \u201cI fight tirelessly for my clients, period. That\u2019s what I am in business to do. I am proud of what I do and who I do it for. \u201d Heller is not the first publicity figure the Kushners have brought in from sources Republicans traditionally might not consider. Jared hired   Josh Raffel right out of Hollywood earlier this month.'"}, "time": 1742561739.2744906}
