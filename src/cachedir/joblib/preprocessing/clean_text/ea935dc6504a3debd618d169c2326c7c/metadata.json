The world is suddenly in disarray, in panic. A man notorious for his bigoted rhetoric, a man who believes in American exceptionalism, who wants to build the walls and to \u2018restore order\u2019, has been elected the 45 th President of the mightiest nation on Earth. His nation is doubtlessly in decline; it is indebted and some would even argue, hopelessly bankrupt, but it is still the Empire, the sole one to this day. Below the surface, Mr. Trump may not be any viler than the Democratic candidate Mrs. Clinton and her clan has been for years. The establishment with which she has been inseparably intertwined for years and decades has been murdering millions all over the world, looting entire continents, and brutally guaranteeing that the Western world would always stay firmly in control of the entire Planet. Throughout the years, Mrs. Clinton has been using \u2018politically correct\u2019 rhetoric, mainly (and often in a twisted way) in order to silence those who dared to criticize her deeds. Still, no matter what her words were stating, millions of people have been vanishing, worldwide, as a result of the policies introduced by her and by her former boss, President Barack Obama. Donald Trump is brusque, aggressive, narcissistic and most likely, brutally honest. What he says is often pure trash, but whatever it is, he is not embarrassed to parade it in public. He has been giving many advanced warnings to both his supporters (including his voters) and to his adversaries. Objectively speaking, he is not any more or any less dangerous than Mrs. Clinton. Both candidates come from the moneyed, pro-establishment milieu. Yet Mr. Trump evokes much greater fear all over the world than his rival, from Asia and Africa to Latin America. It is at least partially because the mainstream Western propaganda rallied determinedly behind the well-tested and \u2018reliable\u2019 Mrs. Clinton (she has proven to be subservient to the Western imperialist regime and to market fundamentalist dogmas), and the Western mainstream media is exactly what is giving \u2018marching orders\u2019 to the local press, particularly in \u2018client\u2019 states in all parts of the world. * Nonetheless, Mr. Trump is definitely frightening on his own account, and just because he ran against (and defeated) the establishment candidate, does not make him less so. Rowan Wolf, Managing Editor at The Greanville Post and publisher of Uncommon Thought , recently summarized what I felt about the recent elections, when she wrote to me (it was right after the results were announced): \u201c I am frightened over the election of Trump. Things were going to be bad here even without that because his position as the candidate for president legitimated the ugliest bigotry and violence. His election, legitimates and institutionalizes it at the highest levels possible. It is not as if this ugliness was not present in the US as it certainly was, but it was not celebrated. His racism extends outside the US and he has already stated numerous times that he would use nukes in the Middle East and just take the oil. He also hates the Earth. He plans to reverse or remove all environmental protections and regulations, and he doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d in global warming. His presidency could not happen at a worse time for our planet.\u201d * I had the extremely bad fortune of spending \u2018the day after\u2019 in the den of the Western pro-establishment mainstream media based in Asia Pacific \u2013 the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Thailand (FCCT). Or perhaps it was not only \u2018bad fortune\u2019 but also some type of perverse desire to witness the great and genuine desperation of those who have, for years and decades, been serving the Empire and its \u2018liberal\u2019 dogmas, twisting the truth and manufacturing hyper-reality. Even before my arrival at the FCCT, the results of elections were finalized. I expected a great mess, and mess it was. I witnessed depressed glances, nervous laughter, small talk, and an excessive consumption of booze. Speeches soon followed: made by the members of Western human rights organizations, of several NGO\u2019s, and press corps. Some Iranian exile began trashing Iran, somehow loosely connecting it to the US elections. Someone else had a go at the Philippine\u2019s anti-imperialist President Duterte. And of course, China was hit on several occasions, and so was Russia, particularly that \u2018evil\u2019 Putin. One after another, speakers mimicked Ms. Clinton\u2019s derogatory pronunciation of Russian President\u2019s name. No one mentioned Thailand or Indonesia even once. It was all grotesque and endlessly sad. Then the chest beating and insulting the voters slowly began\u2026 a slow masochistic public orgy. In the end, several well-behaved members of the public began queuing in front of the microphone, asking polite questions. Not sending the panelists to hell, not insulting them directly to their faces\u2026 Nothing like that! People were just asking non-confrontational questions, and then, patiently and politely waiting for replies. The \u2018client\u2019 states of the West were still very far from the rebellion. * Then my phone became extremely active, as I began receiving messages from all corners of the globe. From Sudan: \u201cI never thought Donald would win! The Sudanese are making fun of Trump saying that he looks like our President Al-Basheer.\u201d From Italy: \u201cBetter than Killary, but still disgusting\u201d. From Uganda: \u201cOur government is acting as if it didn\u2019t back Hillary before the elections.\u201d From Argentina: \u201cNow in the US they will have to eat their own crap\u2026 as they made others eat it for decades.\u201d From Indonesia: \u201cTrump said that he would increase tariffs on imported products. In that case he\u2019ll have to pay more for his suits, as he apparently wears some that are made in Indonesia\u201d. * \u201cWhere were you on the 9-11?\u201d Or now: \u201cWhere were you on 11-8?\u201d Some people compare these two events. On both occasions (or before), no one bothered to listen, to face reality, and as a result, some terrible events took place. On 11-8 I was in Bangkok. On 9-11 in Hanoi, Vietnam, sipping coffee, and looking out of my window. The apartment was on a higher floor of the \u201cHanoi Tower\u201d. The building was literally growing out from the old French prison, where Vietnamese patriots used to be tortured, raped and executed by the French colonialists. If I were to walk all the way towards the very glass panel, I would be able to see, far below, two shiny guillotines, preserved for people to remember the \u2018great enlightened rule of the West over Asia\u2019. Suddenly on the horizon, the sky lit up in a tremendous explosion of colors. The villages surrounding Hanoi were shooting firecrackers and makeshift rockets up to the sky. It was a great fireworks display, something I had never seen before. I turned my television set on. On the BBC coverage, two airplanes were flying, in slow motion, towards the towers of the World Trade Center. A few minutes later I received a phone call from my best friend in Santiago de Chile. \u201cYou would not believe what is happening here,\u201d he reported to me, breathless. \u201cPeople, total strangers, are stopping here, in the middle of the street. They are crying, falling into each other\u2019s arms, and whispering: \u201cJustice takes time, but it always comes!\u201d They were referring to 9-11-1973, when the United States overthrew one of the oldest and greatest democracies on Earth. Chile was raped, its people murdered, its form of government and its economic model were shattered. A few hours after the \u201cevent\u201d, both the Vietnamese and Chilean governments expressed their shock and support for the American people. In Vietnam, the celebrations were not reported. But they took place. Everyone knew it. The great anger against the Empire could be felt, and is still felt, not only in those two great nations, but also all over the world. People are outraged. Those in the United States are\u2026 and also those in the rest of the world are\u2026 although they are outraged for totally different reasons\u2026 but outraged they all are nevertheless! \u201cDemocracy\u201d is the rule of people. It does not mean the \u2018Western multi-party system\u2019. It only means the \u2018rule of the people\u2019, in Greek. It can be based on the ancient \u2018heavenly mandate\u2019 on which the Chinese system is based even now. It can be the modern Latin American form of participatory democracy\u2026 as long as people are ruling. However, they are not ruling. Not in the West, nor in most of the countries of the rest of the world, where the governments are forced upon them by Western imperialism to defend their states and to often adopt very tough measures to do so. People in the United States had spoken, expressing their frustration and anger. People in the rest of the world were not asked who should be leading the world. The next, the most logical step for the world should now be, immediately to reject the leadership of both the United States and Europe. Brexit and 11-8 should be followed by the WORLD-EXIT. What does it mean? Simple: \u2018Let the West eat its own shit, alone, finally\u2019! And let the world be free from those governments and economic and colonialist concepts, which no one here (in Asia, Africa, Latin America or the Middle East) really elected and wants! Once we are at exiting, rejecting and defending, let\u2019s also build huge protective walls around all non-Western countries. To defend them from the Crusaders and hordes that have been looting and plundering the entire Planet for centuries. The citizens of the United States have spoken. Oh yes! So let the rest of the world do the same! Let them vote on WORLD EXIT! It is clear what the result will be!
