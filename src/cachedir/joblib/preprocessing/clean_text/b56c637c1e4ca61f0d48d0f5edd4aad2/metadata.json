[The provision would impose a 40 percent excise tax on all health insurance plans provided by employers that have a value of more than $10, 200 for individual coverage and $27, 500 for family coverage.  The bill (H. R. 173) dubbed the \u201cMiddle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2017,\u201d is   by Democrat Rep. Joe Courtney (CT). \u201cAs President Obama comes to Capitol Hill to try to save his failed health care law, I am proud to take one of the first steps in repealing and replacing this law in order to save the American people from its harmful consequences,\u201d Kelly said in a press release. \u201cThe widespread pain of Obamacare\u2019s higher costs and broken promises is already being felt by countless families and workers, yet with the law\u2019s looming Cadillac Tax, in many ways the worst is yet to come. \u201d Though the Cadillac Tax was originally scheduled to take effect in 2018, currently it is slated for implementation in 2020. According to the press release, \u201canalysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation\u201d finds \u201cthe tax will impact approximately 42 percent of American employers and their employees. \u201d \u201cThe Cadillac Tax is a major reason why the   Affordable Care Act will make health care even less affordable and accessible for so many households across America,\u201d Kelly continued. \u201cSensible health care policy should encourage employers to offer a full range of health plans to their associates, not punish them with an unfair tax for doing so. \u201d \u201cThe sad result will be higher deductibles and fewer services for hardworking Americans,\u201d he added. \u201cWith most Pennsylvanians covered by   health insurance, this Obamacare tax will be a disaster felt especially close to home. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563085.9365778}
