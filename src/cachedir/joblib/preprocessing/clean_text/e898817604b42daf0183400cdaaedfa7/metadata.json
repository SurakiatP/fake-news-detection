Authorities are now questioning whether the player\u2019s complicated sex life was a prime motivation for his years of troublesome behavior, and ultimately his suicide. [Authorities discovered much focus on the Bible inside Hernandez\u2019s jail cell after his death. Not only did he write a portion of a Bible verse on his forehead  \u2014   John 3:16  \u2014   he had also used a red marker to mimic Christ\u2019s stigmata on his hands and feet. Along with the stigmata, which are markings emulating the wounds Jesus suffered on the cross, a Bible was opened to the same verse he excerpted on his forehead. That verse reads, \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whosoever believes in him would not perish but have eternal life. \u201d  The suicide seemed to come at a strange time for Aaron Hernandez, since it occurred only a few days after he had been cleared in his second murder trial. The letter to the player\u2019s prison boyfriend might go toward explaining much of the former New England Patriots\u2019 life, Newsweek reported. Investigations against Hernandez have revealed that there may have been elements of sex, deception, and secrecy to the player\u2019s unsettled life. In 2015 Hernandez was convicted of the murder of Odin Lloyd, the man who was dating the sister of the NFL player\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. In some ways Lloyd\u2019s murder made little sense, but police were working on an angle that Hernandez killed Lloyd because Lloyd knew of the player\u2019s bisexuality and Hernandez wanted that information kept secret. A relationship Hernandez reportedly had with a high school friend also played a role in the investigation. Ernest Wallace, a   in the murder of Lloyd, told police in several different ways that he thought Hernandez was gay. Hernandez\u2019s is bisexuality now seems practically assured after the discovery of the letter to his prison boyfriend. Investigators also speculated that Hernandez\u2019s sexual proclivities may have been at the root of his bouts of violence. Hernandez had a long list of outbursts going back to his youth, and many of these incidents also formed a central part in the case against the NFL player in Lloyd\u2019s murder. Perhaps there will be no way to prove the suspicions that Hernandez\u2019 sexual proclivities led to his turbulent life, but it would certainly make sense.
