A charismatic former military intelligence officer and Missouri\u2019s current secretary of state, Mr. Kander, 35, faced an entrenched Republican incumbent in a place where Donald J. Trump seemed destined to win. Then Mr. Kander released a television ad last month in which he put an   assault rifle together blindfolded while reciting a script about gun rights, and started assailing his rival, Senator Roy D. Blunt, on his lobbyist ties. Suddenly, it was game on. Mr. Kander\u2019s poll numbers soared. So did the panic among Republicans trying to save Mr. Blunt, and possibly their Senate majority. Mr. Kander\u2019s ascent is the starkest demonstration of the volatile and at times confounding dynamics of the battle for control of the Senate, with at least six races in a statistical dead heat just over two weeks before Election Day. Surprisingly, Democrats have improved their chances in places like Missouri and North Carolina, where they seemed to have no shot just six months ago, while they have all but given up in Ohio and pulled their money out of Florida, where prospects had seemed bright. Republicans continue to cling to hope in New Hampshire, Nevada and Pennsylvania, despite what looks like faltering support for Mr. Trump in those states. In several cases, individual state dynamics, candidate quality and a   spending spree have had as much to do with the shifting prospects as the top of the ticket. \u201cWith two weeks to go, control of the Senate is up for grabs,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor of The Rothenberg  Gonzales Political Report. \u201cIf Republicans can break even in the tossup states, they have a chance to maintain control. But if the landscape shifts just a couple of points against Republican candidates, Democrats will capture the majority. \u201d In perhaps the oddest quirk of a decidedly erratic year, Mr. Kander may be benefiting from Mr. Trump\u2019s   message. Mr. Blunt, who has served in Congress since 1997 and whose family is chockablock with lobbyists, is the archetypal boogeyman Mr. Trump has attacked in his assault on Washington insiders. Mr. Kander often finds Trump and Clinton supporters at his campaign events  \u2014   people who fight among themselves, he said, even as they share support for him. \u201cThere are people who will choose to vote for Donald Trump because they want to shake up that conversation,\u201d Mr. Kander said in an interview in St. Louis. \u201cThey are not going to go to that next line on the ballot and vote for somebody who they know is exactly who Donald Trump is talking about. \u201d Until 2004, Missouri was an even more reliable presidential bellwether state than Ohio. But growing homogeneity outside its larger cities has made it more reliably Republican on the presidential level. Still, it remains a state where voters have a tendency to pick Democrats for other statewide offices. \u201cThe misconception about Missouri is that it is a red state,\u201d said Ken Warren, a professor of political science at St. Louis University. \u201cThey don\u2019t like Democrats at the top of the ticket because they are seen as from out of town. But most of our statewide offices are held by Democrats. \u201d It is a reality that Mr. Blunt seems to be just starting to confront, much to his party\u2019s chagrin. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive race, like Missouri races usually are,\u201d he said in an interview at the local Republican headquarters here, where he nibbled on a   bagel grabbed off a buffet, the sort of campaign sustenance typical of the exhausting final weeks on the road. \u201cI\u2019m confident of where we are. But not overly confident. \u201d As of   Mr. Blunt led Mr. Kander 46 percent to 44 percent, a    drop since August. Democrats need to gain five seats to retake control of the Senate  \u2014   four if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, which would give Tim Kaine, her vice president, a tiebreaking vote. Both parties now, surprisingly, view Missouri as a crucial state in that battle. \u201cI\u2019m the 51st vote,\u201d Mr. Blunt warned a small group of female Republican voters here on Thursday, casting himself as the critical piece of a majority. \u201cIf Mrs. Clinton gets elected, the last place to have an impact on the court is the Senate,\u201d he said, referring to the United States Supreme Court. (It actually takes 60 votes to bring a Supreme Court nomination to the Senate floor.) In an extremely costly year for Senate races over all, Missouri has become the     state, with $15 million in ads pouring into its race. Two weeks after Mr. Kander\u2019s   gun ad in September, political action committees and other outside groups dropped more than $8 million into the state on the two candidates, quadruple what they had spent in the previous two weeks, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Kander has benefited from being a sui generis blend: At once, he is a   Democrat, a veteran, a   lawyer who wears the outsider label, and the opponent of an incumbent who is the embodiment of Washington longevity. He has focused on trying to turn Mr. Blunt\u2019s experience into a liability. He has also homed in on the senator\u2019s tangled family ties. Mr. Blunt\u2019s wife is a lobbyist, and his three adult children are registered lobbyists as well. Mr. Kander\u2019s ads and those of outside groups have suggested, among other things, that Mr. Blunt took votes to enrich industries that his family represented. For his part, Mr. Blunt and those groups supporting him have tried to cast Mr. Kander, who was a state representative before becoming secretary of state in 2013, as a toady for Mrs. Clinton and President Obama, who are both unpopular here. One ad shows his face morphing into theirs with the tagline: \u201cFresh face. Same old liberal thinking. \u201d \u201cSenator Blunt genuinely sees everything through the lens of partisan politics,\u201d Mr. Kander said. (Actually, Mr. Blunt is widely viewed as a consummate   in Congress.) Mr. Kander\u2019s military service is a boost, too, in a state with many veterans. Mr. Blunt\u2019s draft deferments have also come up during the campaign, and he recently brought in another Republican senator, Joni Ernst, who has served in the military, to support him at a veterans\u2019 event. \u201c  goes a long way here,\u201d Professor Warren said. \u201cSuperpatriotism is a big thing in Missouri. \u201d Missouri\u2019s contest is indicative of the circumstances in many Senate races. While Mr. Trump is weak in Pennsylvania, for instance, the incumbent, Senator Patrick J. Toomey, has managed to keep the race close by dint of his own record and a Democratic candidate who has been less exciting than her party anticipated. At the same time, in a battle over an open seat in Nevada, Mr. Trump has been a drag on the Republican candidate, United States Representative Joe Heck, not because Mr. Heck supports Mr. Trump but because his support for the Republican nominee has waned. \u201cIn most cases Trump is responsible\u201d for Republican weaknesses, said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for The Cook Political Report, \u201cbut there are quirky things going on. \u201d It is the sort of year that produces voters like Michael Brown, a Vietnam veteran and conservative Republican who came to a small   discussion last week with Mr. Kander in Cape Girardeau. Mr. Brown will not vote for Mr. Trump, he said, but remains undecided about the Senate race. \u201cThis year is the toughest vote I\u2019ve ever cast,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628442.373035}
