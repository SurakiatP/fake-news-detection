But the evidence is now on its way back to Russia for further analysis, and will be put on display for the public soon.\\n\u201cEarlier [Schatzgraber] was only known from written sources, but now we also have real proof,\u201d said a senior researcher at the National Park, Evgeny Ermolov .\\nRussian Arctic National Park via Ruptly \\n\u201cNow we can enter this data in the scientific revolution, and, referring to the evidence, to expand and clarify the idea of the German army operations in the Arctic region during the Second World War,\u201d added team member Eugene Yermolov. \\n(Note: quotes have been translated from Russian). \\nThe discovery is particularly interesting, because there are people who believe that the site\u2019s name, which translates to \u201cTreasure Hunter\u201d, suggests the Nazi base wasn\u2019t just a weather station, but part of a secret mission to find ancient relics.\\nNo, they weren\u2019t looking for the Tesseract (you guys have been watching too many Marvel movies), but archaeological evidence that Nordic populations once ruled the world to justify their propaganda.\\nAlthough there were research institutes in Nazi Germany pursuing that goal, there\u2019s currently no evidence that this was happening at Schatzgraber. But hopefully thorough analysis of the written documents found at the site will provide some more insight into what went on up there in the Arctic Circle during WWII.\\nAlexandra Land has been a disputed territory for decades, but is now part of the Russian Federation, and Russia apparently has plans to build its own permanent military base in the region.\\nLet\u2019s just hope they\u2019ve learnt their lesson, and stay away from polar bear meat.\\nYou can see national park researchers exploring the site in the footage below: Source: http://www.sciencealert.com/russian-scientists-say-they-ve-discovered-a-secret-nazi-base-in-the-arctic \\nFollow WE ARE CHANGE on SOCIAL MEDIA SnapChat: LukeWeAreChange \\nfbook: https://facebook.com/LukeWeAreChange \\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Lukewearechange I nstagram: http://instagram.com/lukewearechange Sign up become a patron and Show your support for alternative news for Just 1$ a month you can help Grow We are change We use Bitcoin Too ! 12HdLgeeuA87t2JU8m4tbRo247Yj5u2TVP Join and Up Vote Our STEEMIT The post Russian scientists say they\u2019ve discovered a secret Nazi base in the Arctic The Nazi stronghold in the Arctic Circle. appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742628441.8268113}
