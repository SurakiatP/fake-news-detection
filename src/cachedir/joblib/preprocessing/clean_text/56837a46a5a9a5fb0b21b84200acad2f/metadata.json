Riot police, helicopters, and an FBI bomb squad are all present at the event. [According to reports from Seattle PD, anarchist protesters outside MILO\u2019s event at Washington University tonight had baseball bats and sharpened signposts confiscated by law enforcement. Police in riot gear have formed a human wall between event attendees and protesters.  Police have also intercepted protesters carrying wooden poles, heavy pipes, and shields according to local news. It is unclear if the protesters were en route to MILO\u2019s event or to   protests elsewhere in Seattle. MILO\u2019s talk, which was scheduled to begin at 10PM eastern time, has been postponed by 45 minutes. Protesters are currently preventing attendees from reaching the venue.  Local reporters are posting video from the university now.
