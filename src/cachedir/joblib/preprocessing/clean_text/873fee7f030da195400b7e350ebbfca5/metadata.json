Mohamed Sharif was a student in Mogadishu, Somalia, an urban war zone terrorized by rival militias. Both arrived in the United States as refugees, through a yearslong process that involved hours of interviews and over a dozen background checks. In late January, President Trump signed an executive order to suspend that program, after months of claiming that the vetting process needed  . The State Department notes that refugees are the most rigorously examined travelers. As the program\u2019s future hangs in limbo  \u2014   last weekend refugees began coming in again,  after a legal challenge to the order  \u2014   we trace the existing steps. Mr. Khalil, 54, now resides in Twin Falls, Idaho, as an American citizen, while Mr. Sharif, 26, lives in Aurora, Colo. as a legal permanent resident. The United Nations gathers the names of people who have fled persecution. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil was in a daze when he arrived in Amman, Jordan, from Baghdad in July 2006  \u2014   he had been unable to think clearly ever since his daughter Maha had not returned from school one day. Mr. Khalil had tried to keep his work with the United States military a secret, knowing it could make his family a target. But the day after Maha disappeared in 2004, he received a call from someone claiming to be from Al Qaeda. The man said that Mr. Khalil had been found out and would have to pay with Maha\u2019s life. After learning that Maha was, indeed, dead, the family tried to stay in Baghdad. But they felt that the other children could be in danger, so, in 2006, Mr. Khalil left Iraq with his wife, Nahida Mohammad, their    son, Mamoon Jumah, and    daughter, Maryam Jumah. As unauthorized immigrants, they could not work and had to send the children to private school. Knowing that their savings would not last, Mr. Khalil registered them as refugees. ____ Mohamed Sharif At age 16, Mr. Sharif arrived alone at Kakuma, a desert camp for refugees in northwest Kenya, in 2007. Somalia had gone through more than a dozen attempts to form a government in his lifetime, and it was dangerous for him to return. Mr. Sharif moved into a   hut in the camp, where the temperature often topped 100 degrees, and registered as a refugee. There, he met Bisharo, a single mother from Somalia with two children, Adnan and Hodan. He picked up work as an electrician. They married, but there was no big wedding. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough money,\u201d he said. An officer hired by the United Nations asks questions about the applicant\u2019s life. Then two officials review the case to determine if the person faces serious persecution back home. If concerns arise, the person is interviewed again or the case is closed. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil and his family arrived with their birth certificates, proof of Iraqi citizenship and marriage certificate, at a building in Amman. Armed guards were posted outside. Over seven hours, they were photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed. There were tears, yelling, frustration as other Iraqis were denied refugee status. When an official asked Mr. Khalil through an Arabic interpreter about Maha, he broke down in tears. \u201cI could not control myself,\u201d he said. As they waited for word, the family began to unravel. No one could sleep through the night. The parents walked their children to and from school each day, fearing something could happen. Then the call came. Mr. Khalil was to return with more documents, including Maha\u2019s death certificate. ____ Mohamed Sharif It was a big day. By 2012, Mr. Sharif had waited years at Kakuma before an official arrived for an interview. Mr. Sharif wore a football    \u2014   he had no dress clothes, and the camp was sweltering. Why did he leave, he was asked. Mr. Sharif described in Somali the way he had fled his home, fearing death. \u201cI don\u2019t have a home to go back to,\u201d he later recalled having said. Months later, Bisharo gave birth to a girl, Nimo. But then Bisharo died. At 22, Mr. Sharif was the single father of three children. American contractors conduct   interviews to prepare for a visit from Homeland Security. Background checks begin. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil was asked about his time in the Iraqi Army. Why did he enlist? Because of the promise of a stable life. Why did he become an officer? There were benefits: a new car and some land. He described teaching American soldiers about the Iraqi chain of command, and telling them to request receipts with serial numbers for deliveries of items like batteries or tires. Otherwise, he said, some could end up for sale on the Iraqi black market. Mr. Khalil answered his interrogators \u201clike a robot,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost my daughter, I lost my house  \u2014   everything,\u201d he said. During this time, Mr. Khalil and his family watched nervously as their bank accounts dwindled. They had to pay $3 a day per person to the Jordanian government to live there without authorization. They could not afford enough diesel fuel to heat their apartment through the winter, so the parents took turns waking up in the middle of the night to turn on the heater an hour at a time. ____ Mohamed Sharif This round, in 2013, took three days. In the first interview, Mr. Sharif and his interviewer cried as he spoke. In the second and third, he had to repeat his story. They asked about his birthplace, his parents, their marriage, his schooling, his journey to the camp, his religion. Had extremists tried to recruit him? Would he do anything against the law? \u201cThe answer is no,\u201d he said later. \u201cThe reason we are here is to get a better life. \u201d The interviewers requested documents. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of our people,\u201d he said, \u201cthey didn\u2019t go to school, they weren\u2019t born in the hospital. \u201d That year, Mr. Sharif met Ubah Isse Mohamed, a camp neighbor, and they married. \u201cShe was loving,\u201d he said. \u201cThe right person for my kids. \u201d Officers visit the camp to verify stories and take fingerprints. Some nations skip this step and rely on United Nations interviews during the process. Faiz Khalil Winter receded and the family was called back for a   appointment. Ms. Mohammad and the children were interviewed together he was questioned alone. American immigration officials asked hundreds of questions  \u2014   many of them repeats from before  \u2014   but they wanted even more detail. The family was fingerprinted again and their retinas were scanned. ____ Mohamed Sharif In the summer of 2014, American officials went to Kakuma. Mr. Sharif had to tell his story again. Then came several    questions. Had he ever been recruited by terrorist agencies? By radical groups? No, he said. No. Then he waited. A medical exam is conducted to identify needs and ensure that people with a contagious disease do not enter the United States until they have been cleared. Faiz Khalil By the summer of 2007, the Khalil children had begun to speak Arabic with a Jordanian accent. The family was sent to a clinic for three days of health evaluations that included   blood work and immunizations. Mr. Khalil and his children received   stress disorder diagnoses. In early 2008, Mr. Khalil got a call. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he recalled an official saying. \u201cYou\u2019re moving to Twin Falls, Idaho. \u201d Mr. Khalil had never heard of it. \u201cI said, \u2018This is in the U. S.?\u2019\u201d He did a quick search online: \u201cIt really scared me more, because I said, \u2018I am going to nowhere. \u2019\u201d They were scheduled to leave in September. As the day drew nearer, Mr. Khalil felt conflicted. Maybe they would fail, he thought. He had heard that life in America was difficult. ____ Mohamed Sharif Later that year, he got a letter. The United States wanted to welcome him. His family, which was further behind in the process, would have to stay behind. Then came a   medical checkup at Kakuma. In early December, he left for a local airport and flew to Nairobi. On Dec. 10, at midnight, he left Kenya for good. Nine nonprofit organizations help refugees resettle. They decide where these new immigrants will live, often opting for more affordable midsize cities. Faiz Khalil On the morning they were set to leave, Mr. Khalil woke up in tears, and he struggled to compose himself. At one point, overcome by fear, he asked their taxi driver to turn around. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him!\u201d Ms. Mohammad shouted. At the airport, something changed. \u201cI had to be strong to support the family,\u201d Mr. Khalil explained later. They traveled for 36 hours on four planes: first to Frankfurt, then Chicago, Salt Lake City and, finally, Twin Falls. It was close to midnight when they arrived. The children were exhausted. \u201cIt was just dark, nobody in the streets, so I was kind of like, \u2018Where we are? \u2019\u201d he said. ____ Mohamed Sharif He touched down at the Denver airport on Dec. 12, in the early evening. A man from Lutheran Family Services took him to a new apartment. The following night, Mr. Sharif walked outside to take in his first snowflakes. \u201cI looked up at the skies, and got it in my eyes,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was really just something amazing for me. \u201d \u201cSome refugees who were in my neighborhood have been in the camp from 1991 until now,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, I can say this: I was the luckiest guy ever. Ever. \u201d Refugees can receive federal cash assistance for up to eight months. They can tap into federally funded language instruction courses, employment services and social adjustment programs for up to five years. They are required to apply for permanent residence after their first year. Faiz Khalil In the morning light, Twin Falls did not appear as foreboding. The children learned English quickly, while Mr. Khalil and Ms. Mohammad practiced by watching \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cTitanic. \u201d Both work as interpreters for a refugee resettlement center, and Mr. Khalil still advises United States military troops on working in Iraq. Mr. Khalil and Ms. Mohammad are registered independents and voted for Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on refugees was unfair, Mr. Khalil said  \u2014   other Iraqis would suffer after working to help the American military. Maryam is now 14, but acts as if she were much older, her father said. Mamoon, 19, is \u201cvery American,\u201d Mr. Khalil said  \u2014   sometimes speaking to his parents with a \u201csharpness\u201d to which they are unaccustomed. When Mr. Khalil thinks of Maha, he likes to look at old family photos. His children rarely bring her up in front of him. But when they do not know he is listening, he occasionally overhears them talking about her. \u201cThey have a good life, better than I had,\u201d Mr. Khalil said. ____ Mohamed Sharif He is on the road constantly, working long hours as a truck driver to save for his family\u2019s arrival. They live in Nairobi, but cannot go to school because they do not have Kenyan documents. Without them, he said, \u201cI am alone. \u201d Mr. Sharif hoped to see them by Feb. 16, Nimo\u2019s fourth birthday. His    in Indianapolis has already bought them toys. But a week into his presidency, Mr. Trump threw the future of Mr. Sharif\u2019s family into uncertainty when he signed the refugee order. \u201cMy kids keep asking, \u2018Daddy when are we coming? \u2019\u201d Mr. Sharif has not told them yet. \u201cThey cannot know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make them hopeless. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563797.7314422}
