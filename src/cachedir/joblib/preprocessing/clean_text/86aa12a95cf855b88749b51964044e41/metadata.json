The apology by Terrence M. Cunningham, who leads the International Association of Chiefs of Police, came during a speech in San Diego at the group\u2019s annual conference. The remarks were an unusual yet symbolic step by law enforcement, whose members have often denied responsibility for deteriorating relationships with the communities they serve. For law enforcement officials to regain the trust of minorities, they must begin \u201cto acknowledge and apologize for the actions of the past and the role that our profession has played in society\u2019s historical mistreatment of communities of color,\u201d said Chief Cunningham, who also leads the Police Department in Wellesley, Mass. His comments were met with praise for addressing the problem, and with criticism by some activists and other police groups. Chief Cunningham\u2019s group, which has about 16, 000 members worldwide, was formed in 1893, and is among the nation\u2019s oldest and most respected law enforcement associations. But the organization has resisted recent efforts for change, and it refused to agree to proposals that would encourage officers to use less force  \u2014   including deadly force  \u2014   when confronting suspects. Over the last two years, the fatal shootings of a number of black men, including the deaths last month of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Okla. and Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, N. C. have increased tensions between the police and   and have led to demands for greater police accountability. Chief Cunningham cited racially biased federal, state and local laws that had made police officers \u201cthe face of oppression for far too many of our fellow citizens,\u201d including \u201censuring legalized discrimination or even denying the basic rights of citizenship to many of our fellow Americans. \u201d He added, however, that police critics \u201cmust also acknowledge that today\u2019s officers are not to blame for the injustices of the past. \u201d Chief Cunningham did not mention contemporary issues of police misconduct  \u2014   often related to race  \u2014   that have been documented in recent Justice Department reviews of police departments in Ferguson, Mo. San Francisco Philadelphia and Baltimore, among other places. Critics said Chief Cunningham undercut his message by failing to recognize racism among   police forces. \u201cPolice racism is not just a relic of history. Until police leaders acknowledge that bias is a problem right now, they will not have earned the confidence of communities of color,\u201d said Paul Butler, a former federal prosecutor, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center and the author of \u201cLet\u2019s Get Free: A   Theory of Justice. \u201d Chief Cunningham wrote in an email after his speech: \u201cToo many lives have been lost already, and this must end. It is my hope that many other law enforcement executives will deliver this same message to their local communities, particularly those segments of their communities that lack trust and feel disenfranchised. \u201d For some police groups, the remarks by Chief Cunningham  \u2014   who is stepping down this week as the organization\u2019s leader  \u2014   were an unfair criticism of officers, who are working in one of the most difficult periods in   relations in recent history. \u201cSuch appeasement of the violent   movement is just one more nail in the coffin of American law enforcement,\u201d said William Johnson, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations. \u201cThe people who support American police officers aren\u2019t looking for an apology. And for the people who hate the police, it won\u2019t make any difference. \u201d Kofi Ademola, a Black Lives Matter organizer in Chicago, said that if there was to be an honest conversation about policing, then law enforcement organizations like Chief Cunningham\u2019s would not only have to address contemporary police misconduct, but also be willing to discuss the violence that Mr. Ademola said was inherent in policing. While Chief Cunningham\u2019s apology might not be entirely satisfactory for critics of the police, it represents progress, said David A. Harris, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law who has written about police accountability. \u201cIt has been a long time coming,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might not be enough, but at least it represents an openness to understanding that the police have been at the tip of the spear in discriminatory policies. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563461.4235651}
