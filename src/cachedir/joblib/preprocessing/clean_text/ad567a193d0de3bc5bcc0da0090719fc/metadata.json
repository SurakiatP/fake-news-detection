SARAH JESSICA PARKER has a voice made for libraries, which is convenient because we are in one  \u2014   specifically, the Amagansett Free Library on Long Island, a location Parker chose because she has always loved libraries and because it\u2019s close to the beach house she owns with fellow actor Matthew Broderick, to whom she has been married since 1997. It\u2019s late summer. She is wearing a seasonable, unfashionable tan under a white cotton dress with high espadrilles and she has brought her glasses, her Blackberry, her sweater in case of air conditioning and a   manuscript. You\u2019d be excused for guessing the manuscript is her own. Parker, 51, has been acting for over four decades, which is plenty of justification for a memoir. It\u2019s been almost 20 years since the premiere of \u201cSex and the City,\u201d the show that fixed her star in Manhattan\u2019s sky and made her character, Carrie Bradshaw, the avatar of   womanhood. Neither character nor actress has since known a day\u2019s rest from inspiring other people\u2019s personal style, and if Parker were to print an inventory of her storage closet and bind it in her favorite color, peacock blue, it would be a best seller. Yet Parker would rather see her initials on the spine than her name on the cover, and next year she will. Hogarth, the publishing house founded in 1917 by Virginia and Leonard Woolf, is mounting SJP for Hogarth, where, as editorial director, Parker will help to find, edit and publish three or four new novels a year. The head of Hogarth, Molly Stern, met Parker at a luncheon three years ago and offered her the role over dinner this past spring. Parker said yes in a second. \u201cI have always loved to read for the same reason I love to act,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is that other people\u2019s stories are more interesting to me than my own. \u201d Parker\u2019s father was a poet and journalist, and she has \u201cthe greatest respect and love\u201d for what writers, editors and even literary agents do. What she is doing herself, for Hogarth, is an ode more to her mother, Barbara Forste, a retired nursery schoolteacher and lifelong, compulsive reader. If Parker can be found reading in the makeup chair on an HBO set, it is because Forste used to drive the kids to school with a novel in her lap, and if Parker is excited to work with librarians  \u2014   Hogarth is partnering with the American Library Association to get more books, and not just Hogarth books, into more hands  \u2014   it is because Forste made sure a young Sarah Jessica was never without a library book in her school bag. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d she asks me, picking up one of the two paperbacks I\u2019ve brought with me, scanning the back cover and opening it at random to bury her nose in the crepey musk. \u201cPeople have tried to bottle the smell of old books,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s the most elusive thing, like trying to recreate a great story. You can\u2019t, which is what makes it special. \u201d A literary manuscript, she says, should come with a blank white cover  \u2014   no title, no name  \u2014   like a vial of perfume for a blind test, without a whiff of identity. The manuscript she\u2019s reading is of a novel by Edan Lepucki, \u201cWoman No. 17,\u201d to be published by Hogarth in May, and it is one of dozens she will read  \u2014   for research, a sense of the landscape  \u2014   before fall, when SJP for Hogarth makes its first round of selections. Criteria, says Parker, include \u201cgreat stories\u201d and \u201cglobal voices,\u201d which is another way of saying she can\u2019t say too much. But we can take our clues from the qualities she has noted in recent literature. The Irish novelist Eimear McBride wields a language in her 2013 debut, \u201cA Girl Is a   Thing,\u201d that is as \u201cbrutal and mythic, almost familiar\u201d as it is formally inventive, whereas Colson Whitehead takes a history of mass brutality and makes it \u201chappen right in front of you\u201d in his latest, \u201cThe Underground Railroad. \u201d Donna Tartt\u2019s 2013 novel, \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d is magnificent in its sweep but also in its dusty particulars, like \u201cthe smell of dad\u2019s wet wool in the back of a closet,\u201d while Lionel Shriver\u2019s \u201cThe   World\u201d makes a trip to the grocery store unforgettable. (Details, for Parker, are \u201cthe marrow that you suck out of the bone\u201d of a story.) From the Modernist period, her favorite novelist isn\u2019t Virginia Woolf, who wanted to have no country, but rather Evelyn Waugh, whose characters are most in need of home. Home is what draws Parker, too, to the origins of Hogarth. \u201cBecause Virginia and Leonard Woolf were printing books out of their home, and because they were publishing work by their friends, they were telling exactly the stories they wanted to tell,\u201d she says. \u201cI love most the idea of community here, and that the history of the imprint is personal. There was nothing mercenary about it. The Woolfs were storytellers. \u201d  \u2014   Sarah Nicole Prickett YOU COULD CALL IT A career crisis, though that would be putting it mildly. After a period of exile, T\u2019Challa, the king of Wakanda, has returned to the seat of power to find his nation roiled by natural disaster, political strife and war. The king\u2019s most trusted adviser, his sister Shuri, had ruled in his absence, but died in battle. He is facing a rebellion against the crown led by a charismatic female warrior. And that heady brew of toil and trouble  \u2014   those are just   problems. T\u2019Challa has a superhero   Black Panther, that comes with its own welter of burdens and existential anxieties. These are the circumstances in which we meet the eponymous hero in the latest   story arc of \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d the venerable Marvel Comics series, set in a mythical African country. The new stories are written by the journalist   Coates, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, who has emerged in recent years as one of America\u2019s most powerful voices. Coates\u2019s writing on race and politics combines reportage, deep dives into history and the sort of exhortative   that merits the heady adjective \u201cprophetic. \u201d \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d his acclaimed 2014 Atlantic cover feature, reframed the debate about the American social compact around the bitter histories of white supremacy, redlining and the plunder of black wealth and black bodies. These themes came together, in a kind of stormy blues fugue, in the   essay \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d a best seller that won the National Book Award last year, was a finalist for the Pulitzer and landed the author a \u201cgenius grant\u201d from the MacArthur Foundation. Coates has attained an exalted perch, the rare public intellectual whose reach extends from the ivory tower to the street, hailed by Toni Morrison as the heir to James Baldwin, shouted out by Chance the Rapper on a mixtape. These days, Coates finds himself turning down more offers than most journalists get in a lifetime. But when Marvel came calling, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIt was the craziest offer I ever got,\u201d says Coates, who ended up collaborating with the artist Brian Stelfreeze. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to mull it over. \u201d Writing comic books would seem to represent a radical change of course for Coates. But it is also a return to roots. Growing up in West Baltimore, he was an obsessive reader of \u201c \u201d and \u201cThe Uncanny  . \u201d \u201cThey felt like an allegory for what my life was,\u201d Coates says. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d has the rock \u2019em, sock \u2019em action and pulp plotlines that comics fans expect. But Coates\u2019s preoccupations peek through. His \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a meditation on the burdens and costs of political power, on gender relations, on the dynamics of popular uprisings. The language also has a telltale Coatesian ring, mixing a journalist\u2019s economy with ringing lyricism. \u201cBefore I became a journalist, I really wanted to be a poet,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018Black Panther\u2019 reminded me of the old days of trying to write poetry. You need to get things across but you don\u2019t have much space. \u201d Coates has signed on to write another dozen \u201cBlack Panther\u201d books. And he has become something of   impresario, helping to recruit two leading black writers, the essayist Roxane Gay and the poet Yona Harvey, to collaborate on a \u201cBlack Panther\u201d companion series, \u201cWorld of Wakanda. \u201d For Coates, the sideline in comics is more than just another way to exercise his muse. It is a relief: \u201cIt was very hard to write \u2018Between the World and Me.\u2019 I don\u2019t mean the craft, although of course the craft is hard. I mean that it takes a toll on you emotionally. You need to go in another direction every once in a while. \u201d He chuckles. \u201c\u2018Black Panther\u2019 is where I go to play. \u201d  \u2014   Jody Rosen'"}, "time": 1742563185.8445168}
