Mike Lee ( ) said if given the opportunity to be nominated by the president to the Supreme Court, he would not turn it down.  Host Doug Wright laid out a scenario that the president would make such an appeal to Lee that he was sorely needed by the country to serve on the high court. \u201cIf he asked me that question I would not say no,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I want to qualify that by first of all by pointing out that I\u2019m grateful to have just been reelected to the U. S. Senate. This is the job I wanted. This is the job I sought twice now and the job I was elected to now twice. And I\u2019m grateful to have been reelected with the support of 70 percent of voters in Utah. \u201d \u201cThat said, if the president approached me in the manner you just described, I wouldn\u2019t tell him no and I\u2019m honored to be on that list. \u201d (  The Hill) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742628537.248966}
