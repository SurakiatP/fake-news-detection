[ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\\nPlease Scroll Down For Video Below! According to this report, General Cartwright, a four-star American Marine general and formerly the second-ranking officer in the entire US military, was forced by the Obama regime to plead guilty in a US Federal Court, on 17 October, for the crime of speaking to the internationally respected foreign policy reporter David Sanger.\\nGeneral Cartwright\u2019s talks with this reporter, this report explains, involved the Obama regimes secret, and deadly, deployment of the most dangerous computer virus ever created named Stuxnet\u2014and that Sanger detailed in his book Confront and Conceal: Obama\u2019s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power that painted an unsettling picture of a White House perplexed by Afghanistan, confused by the dilemma of humanitarian intervention, and thrown off balance by the Arab Spring.\\n\\nUS Marine 4-Star General James Cartwright \\nAfter the 2012 publication of Sanger\u2019s book revealing for the first time the many war crimes committed by the Nobel Peace Prize winning President Obama, this report continues, the Obama regime retroactively classified everything General Cartwright had told to Sanger (and that affected Hillary Clinton too, but who wasn\u2019t charged), and then promptly filed charges against him for lying to US federal investigators\u2014and that with his guilty plea now puts him at risk of serving 5 years in prison and having to pay a $250,000 fine.\\nAt the exact same time General Cartwright was standing in a US Federal Court watching the Obama regime destroy his life and reputation yesterday, this report astonishingly details, President Obama ordered US military forces to allow an estimated 9,000 Islamic State terrorists to escape from Mosul that was authorized by a \u201c deal/agreement \u201d he had made with Saudi Arabia\u2014and that just hours ago Foreign Minister Lavrov responded against by warning the Americans that if these fighters are allowed to leave Mosul and go to Syria, Russia would make \u201c the appropriate military and political decisions \u201d.\\nAnd of these 9,000 Islamic State terrorists President Obama is allowing to escape from Mosul, this report grimly states, is their terror leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2014who just minutes prior to the US-led attack on Mosul beginning yesterday, was \u201c magically whisked \u201d to safety.\\n\\nISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (left) and President Obama (right) \\nMoD experts writing in this report note that President Obama\u2019s \u201c fantasy strategy \u201d of defeating these Islamic State terrorists by allowing them and their leader to escape the battlefield makes no logical military sense at all\u2014unless, of course, the Obama regime, and its Saudi Arabian and Qatar allies (who Hillary Clinton secretly admitted were funding these barbarians), never planned on defeating them in the first place.\\nBeing called by the American military as Operation Inherent Resolve , this report continues, the Obama regimes \u201c make-believe/pretend \u201d battle to defeat ISIS terrorists in Mosul began yesterday (17 October) and is being led by over 6,000 US troops [the Pentagon still refuses to admit exactly how many thousands of US troops are really in Iraq and Syria] backed by Australian troops rushed to the war zone (9.45 a.m. IST bulletin)\u2014but whose true \u201c aim/goal \u201d, some experts claim, is a \u201c secret terror deal \u201d between the US and Saudi Arabia to allow these barbarians [who have already killed over 33,000 people worldwide ] to go to Syria so that they can kill Russian soldiers.\\n\\nStanding ready to defeat this Obama-Saudi Arabian \u201cmaster plan\u201d to unleash these Islamic State terrorists on Russian troops in Syria, however, this report notes, are the 100,000 estimated Iranian-backed Shiite forces who are making ready to destroy these barbarians during their \u201cplanned and protected\u201d US escape.\\nTo the consequences of the failure of President Obama\u2019s and Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201cmaster plan\u201d for their ISIS terrorists, this report continues, Israeli intelligence officials are now warning that these Shiite militias loyal to Iran will not take part in the fighting to liberate Mosul, but will be stationed to the west, where they will block ISIS attempts to flee to their Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, and from there, these militia fighters will be able to move ahead Tehran\u2019s secret project of forging a path to the Mediterranean through Iraq and Syria\u2014and that, interestingly, US president candidate Donald Trump\u2019s top military advisor, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, concurred with yesterday by his, likewise, warning that Iran will be the real winner when the Iraqi city of Mosul is taken back from the Islamic State.\\n\\nTo the American people being allowed to know the \u201c horrid truth \u201d of the Obama-Clinton-Saudi Arabia-Qatar \u201c cabal of evil \u201d destroying the Middle East, this report says, continues to be nearly non-existent as the mainstream American reporters who are supposed to be telling these people truthful facts, are, instead, showering Hillary Clinton with money, while at the same suppressing from the public their knowledge of her many crimes proven by Wikileaks\u2014and that, astonishingly, CNN reporter Chris Cuomo proved by blatantly lying to the American people this week falsely telling them it was illegal for them to read Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret Wikileaks emails\u2014with him further lying and saying that journalists, like him, were allowed to read them, so people should listen to him, not what they can see (and prove) for themselves.\\nWith General Cartwright now facing years in prison for a \u201c made-up/pretend \u201d Obama regime crime, while the leader of ISIS is allowed to go free, this report concludes, one can only \u201c wonder in fear \u201d what the next Obama-Clinton outrage will be\u2014but with President Putin\u2019s patience \u201c fast running out \u201d, his previous warning to these Americans of World War III may be the only thing to stop this madness before the whole world is destroyed by these insane madmen, and woman.\\n'"}, "time": 1742563117.8628676}
