Her friends would tell investigators that Ms. Berman, a     screenwriter and journalist, would never have let her three dogs run free, for fear they would be hit by a car speeding down narrow Benedict Canyon. Nor would she have opened the door to a stranger, but the police found the back door open and the front unlocked. Suspicion passed from her landlady, with whom she had been feuding, to her manager and even to geriatric gangsters from Las Vegas who might have known her mobster father back in the days of Bugsy Siegel. But eventually investigators focused on a wealthy man from a powerful New York real estate family whom she had met in college during the 1960s and for the rest of her life regarded as a brother and a kindred spirit. Robert A. Durst. She spoke adoringly of \u201cBobby\u201d and set up some girlfriends on blind dates with Mr. Durst, but to a few, she shared dark misgivings. After all these years, Mr. Durst now sits in Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial for her murder. Prosecutors say Mr. Durst killed Ms. Berman to prevent her from revealing any of his secrets surrounding the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, a case that had been reopened just before Ms. Berman\u2019s death in 2000. Mr. Durst and his lawyers insist that he did not kill Ms. Berman and does not know who did. He has pleaded not guilty. While Mr. Durst\u2019s story has become familiar over time, Ms. Berman, who was 55 when she died, remains a largely unknown figure. Her friends describe her as a smart, funny and skilled storyteller, who neither smoked nor drank. She enjoyed being the center of attention but was racked by depression and severe fears of heights and bridge crossings. \u201cShe was an ambitious, very talented, intelligent but extremely damaged person,\u201d said Julie Smith, a mystery writer based in New Orleans and the executor of Ms. Berman\u2019s meager estate. \u201cShe had a fascinating background. You never knew what she would say or do. \u201d All the while, Ms. Berman talked at the pace of an Olympic speedskater. Her trademark look  \u2014   thick dark hair down to her shoulders and bangs across her forehead that often obscured her eyes  \u2014   never varied. On good days, she could sit in front of her computer and write for eight or 10 hours at a clip, but on other days, she could not bear getting out of bed. Her writing  \u2014   whether it was a 1975 article for City magazine titled \u201cIn San Francisco, City of Sin, Why Can\u2019t I Get Laid?\u201d or her 1981 memoir, \u201cEasy Street,\u201d of growing up the daughter of a Jewish mobster in Las Vegas  \u2014   brought her some measure of fame. But she spent her final years in poverty, desperate to revive her screenwriting career and fending off eviction from her Benedict Canyon home. \u201cI see now that Susan\u2019s best stories were always those about Susan,\u201d said Carol Pogash, a reporter who worked with Ms. Berman at The San Francisco Examiner in the 1970s. \u201cHer life was the best drama she ever told. \u201d When Mr. Durst first came under suspicion, many of her friends could not believe it. They repeated, like a mantra, \u201cSuzie loved Bobby Bobby loved Suzie. \u201d Whatever secrets Ms. Berman knew about Mr. Durst, she had a fierce,   sense of loyalty to her friends and to Mr. Durst in particular. \u201cShe felt very close to him,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThere have been times I thought all kinds of things about Bob. But I never thought she would\u2019ve ratted him out for any reason. \u201d Ms. Berman grew up in the 1950s in Las Vegas, where her father, David Berman, treated her like a princess. Elvis and Liberace sang at her birthday parties. She was blissfully unaware until much later of her father\u2019s ties to the mob at the Flamingo and Riviera hotels. Her father died in 1957 on an operating table when she was 12. Her mother, Gladys, was institutionalized and a year later killed herself. Ms. Berman met Mr. Durst in the 1960s while attending the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was a graduate student. There was an instant and powerful bond, friends say. He was the son of a powerful New York developer, and his mother, he told her, had also died by suicide, although members of the Durst family say it was an accident. Mr. Durst described Ms. Berman as his best friend for much of his life during a 2015 interrogation by John Lewin, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles who is leading the prosecution of Mr. Durst. After attending journalism school at the University of California, Berkeley, Ms. Berman worked for The Examiner, mostly for the style section. But she had higher aspirations. In 1977, she moved to New York, where her articles appeared frequently in New York magazine. It was a heady time, with Ms. Berman, Mr. Durst and their friends frequently making the rounds at glamorous nightclubs like Xenon or Studio 54, where Mr. Durst, back in New York and working for his father, knew one of the owners, Steve Rubell. To celebrate the publication of her memoir, Ms. Berman held a spectacular party on Nov. 11, 1981, at Sammy\u2019s Roumanian Steakhouse, a Lower East Side institution known for its frozen vodka and   Jewish cooking. She wore a   dress and lined the walls with oversize photos of her father and mother. \u201cShe was jubilant,\u201d recalled Stephen M. Silverman, a friend and then neighbor of Ms. Berman\u2019s. Less than three months later, in February 1982, Ms. Berman was at Mr. Durst\u2019s side after he reported to the police that his first wife, Kathleen Durst, was missing. Kathie, as she was known, was only months away from graduating from medical school. Ms. Durst had wanted a divorce. The couple\u2019s marriage had descended into a hell of \u201cfighting, slapping, pushing,\u201d as Mr. Durst told the producers of \u201cThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\u201d a   HBO documentary broadcast in 2015. Mr. Durst told the police at the time that he had put Kathie on a train in Westchester County, where the couple owned a cottage, bound for their Manhattan apartment because she had class the next day. With the case generating tabloid headlines, Ms. Berman managed his contacts with reporters and fended off bothersome inquiries. Ms. Berman had told many of her friends that she was distressed about what \u201cpoor Bobby\u201d was going through. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t believe that her friend from U. C. L. A. was capable of killing anybody,\u201d said Hillary Johnson, a friend of Ms. Berman\u2019s. But there were hints that something else might be going on. \u201cIn those days, she\u2019d talk about her friend Bob and how his wife had disappeared and I must never write about it,\u201d said Ms. Smith, the mystery writer. \u201cI always took that as a warning. \u201d The day after Ms. Durst disappeared, someone identifying herself as Kathie Durst called Albert Kuperman, the dean of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, to say she was not feeling well and would not be able to attend class. Investigators in New York and California have long suspected that the call was made not by Ms. Durst but by Ms. Berman. The circumstances of that call are of keen interest to the prosecutor in the Berman murder case. During his 2015 interrogation of Mr. Durst, Mr. Lewin, the prosecutor, noted the oddity of the call\u2019s going to Mr. Kuperman, who barely knew Ms. Durst, instead of to her supervisor at the pediatric clinic where she was working. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have the name of the doctor and the place she was going to be doing it,\u201d Mr. Lewin asked. \u201cRight. \u201d Mr. Durst did not respond. Miriam Barnes, a friend of Ms. Berman\u2019s who lived next door on Beekman Place in Manhattan, has her own vivid memory of Ms. Berman at the time Ms. Durst vanished. Unlike many of Ms. Berman\u2019s other friends, she has not been interviewed by investigators from New York or Los Angeles. One afternoon  \u2014   she cannot recall the exact date after nearly 35 years  \u2014   Ms. Berman returned to her apartment building after work and immediately sought her out, Ms. Barnes said. Ms. Berman was both \u201cvery nervous and sad. \u201d They sat face to face in chairs in the hallway of Ms. Berman\u2019s apartment as Ms. Berman leaned forward. \u201cShe said, \u2018Bobby asked me to do something, and I did it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barnes said. \u201c\u2018If anything happens to me, just remember, Bobby did it. \u2019\u201d Ms. Berman never explained her cryptic comment, Ms. Barnes said, but it stuck with her nonetheless. In any event, a few years after Ms. Durst vanished, Ms. Berman returned to Los Angeles to focus on screenwriting. In 1984, Ms. Berman married a man named Mister Margulies, whom she had met in line at the Writers Guild while they each registered a screenplay. The wedding was a lavish production at the Hotel   an old Hollywood hotel that had once housed Jimmy Stewart, Lauren Bacall and Audrey Hepburn. Mr. Durst walked her down the aisle. The film producer Robert Evans offered a toast: \u201cI don\u2019t know Mister, but I can tell him Susan is the most seductive woman I ever met. \u201d The marriage did not work out, and Mr. Margulies was soon dead of a drug overdose. Ms. Berman worked relentlessly on a series of book and film projects, but by the late 1990s she was in desperate financial shape, unable to pay rent or even the mechanic who had fixed her Isuzu. She scrambled to reach Mr. Durst to ask for money, as she had in the past. He eventually sent her two checks, for $25, 000 each. In a note to \u201cDearest Bobby\u201d dated Nov. 5, 2000, Ms. Berman seemed to fear that the gift had ruptured their friendship: \u201cI don\u2019t want my last request to be the last time we communicate  \u2014   our friendship means so much to me, Bobby. I hope you forgive me for not keeping pace with your more successful life. \u201d At about the same time, Mr. Durst learned that he was the focus of a new investigation into the disappearance of Ms. Durst by Jeanine Pirro, the district attorney of Westchester County. A panicky Mr. Durst fled New York, renting apartments in Galveston, Tex. and New Orleans while posing as a mute woman. In \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d Mr. Durst described how Ms. Berman had told him that the police wanted to talk to her. Mr. Durst repeated that claim during his 2015 interrogation by Mr. Lewin. \u201cSusan told me that she had been contacted by Los Angeles and New York detectives,\u201d Mr. Durst said, according to a transcript. \u201cAnd, uhm, they want to come talk to me. \u201d But then Mr. Lewin shocked him. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something,\u201d Mr. Lewin said. \u201cThat was not true. They had not contacted her. \u201d Mr. Lewin added: \u201cI think that Susan was trying to subtly squeeze you for money. Uhm, by the way, for, for what\u2019s it\u2019s worth, Bob, \u2019cause I know you care about her, I don\u2019t think Susan ever would have said anything. \u201d According to court records in the case, Mr. Durst flew to California on Dec. 19, 2000, from New York. Three days later, Ms. Berman drove to dinner at the Broadway Deli in Santa Monica and a movie with Richard B. Markey, a comedy producer and writer who was the last person known to have seen her alive. Ms. Berman dropped off Mr. Markey at his house at 10:30 p. m. on Dec. 22, 2000, and drove home. Hours later, Ms. Berman was dead.'"}, "time": 1742628513.9138608}
