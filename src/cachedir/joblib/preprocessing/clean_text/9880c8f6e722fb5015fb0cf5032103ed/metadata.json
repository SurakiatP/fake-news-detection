Dust flew in the air. Soon, Mayor Bill de Blasio clambered aboard. In a car, it might have taken 30 minutes or longer for him to make the roughly   drive from his old Brooklyn stamping grounds to an event in Queens. By air, the trip  \u2014   a fantasy of nearly every New Yorker ever caught in traffic on the   Expressway  \u2014   was considerably shorter. But the headache it caused Mr. de Blasio on Monday might not have been worth the trip, as a photograph and a video of the copter incongruously parked in the middle of a city park ricocheted around the internet, and reporters waited outside City Hall to ask him about it. The attention to his flight presented a   situation for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who has been criticized for arriving late to events and now finds himself justifying his attempts to arrive on time. The mayor, like his predecessors, has occasionally availed himself of the Police Department\u2019s helicopters to get to important events. Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an experienced helicopter pilot, did not hesitate to use city helicopters when necessary, or his own private helicopter. In 2012, Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent, was caught using a helipad in Midtown Manhattan for weekend jaunts during times when it was closed. Mr. de Blasio, for his part, has been less of a fan. Last year he told Grace Rauh of the news channel NY1 that riding in a helicopter was \u201cnot my thing. \u201d And in January, he announced a reduction in flights of tourist copters, citing \u201cthe nonstop din of helicopters\u201d as a \u201cmajor    issue for New Yorkers living near heavily trafficked routes. \u201d Eric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s top spokesman, said Mr. de Blasio had flown to Rikers Island to Jacobi Medical Center, to be at the bedside of injured firefighters and to Hofstra University, for the first presidential debate last month between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton, whose campaign Mr. de Blasio has ardently supported. He traveled by plane to campaign for her in Ohio on Saturday. In each case, Mr. Phillips said, the decision to go by helicopter was made by the mayor\u2019s police detail. He described the flights as \u201cinfrequent,\u201d and directed questions about the total number of trips to the Police Department, whose officials declined to provide the data, saying it would have to be requested under the state Freedom of Information Law. \u201cThe security and transportation of the mayor are determined by the N. Y. P. D.,\u201d the department said in a statement attributed to John Miller, the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence. \u201cWe do not discuss the specifics of security. \u201d Besides saying Mr. de Blasio had a \u201cseries of meetings,\u201d City Hall officials would not describe the mayor\u2019s preflight activities in Brooklyn, where he regularly travels to go to the gym and also goes for meetings at favorite restaurants in his old neighborhood. His public schedule listed a morning speech and two   radio appearances earlier in the day. \u201cWe don\u2019t detail internal or personal meetings,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, raising the possibility that Mr. de Blasio had been engaged in a personal errand that delayed him enough to necessitate air travel over the   Expressway. \u201cHe had a series of meetings in Brooklyn. \u201d Pressed as to whether the meetings were personal or city business, Mr. Phillips repeated himself: \u201cI\u2019m saying he had a series of meetings in Brooklyn, and I\u2019m declining to make public the details of nonpublic meetings. \u201d Maggie Lehrman took video of the helicopter landing in Prospect Park just before 4:30 p. m. on Friday as she walked her    son in a stroller near 15th Street in Park Slope. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before in Prospect Park I\u2019ve lived in Park Slope for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to judge too harshly. It was definitely unusual. It seemed a little odd. \u201d The mayor took the helicopter and landed in another city green space, Hunters Point South Park, in Long Island City, Queens, before traveling to a training center in the area for a 6:30 p. m. event hosted by the Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry. The administration\u2019s explanation that the police detail had made the decision to use the helicopter recalled the mayor\u2019s response early in his tenure when, after unveiling a traffic safety plan that included lowering of the speed limit on most city roads, his city vehicle was caught speeding. \u201cI have great respect for N. Y. P. D. security training and protocols,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said after the incident, pointing to a remark by the commissioner at the time, William J. Bratton, who said the detail had been moving with the flow of traffic as it was trained to do. \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with what Commissioner Bratton said, and I refer you to his comments. \u201d As the mayor arrived at City Hall on Monday afternoon  \u2014   by   sport utility vehicle  \u2014   Mr. de Blasio was asked about his helicopter trip. He declined to comment.'"}, "time": 1742562478.7802331}
