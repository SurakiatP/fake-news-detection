Bahram Qasemi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, announced the decision Friday morning, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The agency reported that the decision had been made by \u201ca special committee, which opposed to presence of the team after necessary studies. \u201d Mr. Qasemi said the ministry opposed the Americans\u2019 participation because of Mr. Trump\u2019s order. \u201cWe\u2019re in talks about it right at the moment,\u201d said Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U. S. A. Wrestling. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty devastated. \u201d A U. S. A. Wrestling statement, while noting that the group had not received official confirmation of the decision, said: \u201cIf these reports are true, U. S. A. Wrestling is extremely disappointed about this, which we believe would be an unacceptable situation. Wrestling is about competition and good will through sport, and is no place for politics. \u201d The event, the Freestyle World Cup, is scheduled for Feb. 16 and 17 in Kermanshah, Iran. Held annually, it pits the best wrestlers in the world in team competition. Last year, the event was held in Los Angeles, and it is scheduled to be held in Iowa City in 2018. Iran has won the event five years in a row. Americans and Iranians regularly wrestle in each other\u2019s countries, with few problems, if any. Wrestling is one of the most popular sports in Iran: 43 of the nation\u2019s 69 Olympic medals have come in wrestling. The United States and Iran worked together in 2013 to persuade the International Olympic Committee to keep wrestling in the Summer Games when it was threatened with removal. There is an international wrestling meet scheduled for May in Times Square, an annual contest pitting top Americans against international stars. But it is not clear if Iranians will be granted sports visas to compete. Mr. Trump\u2019s order bars visitors from seven nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Nenad Lalovic, the president of United World Wrestling, the international federation, said in a statement: \u201cThough we had hoped for a different outcome from Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry, we appreciate the complex nature of this decision. We are currently working to find a solution for the Freestyle World Cup as soon as possible. \u201d \u201cUnited World Wrestling hosts a full calendar of events every season, and we\u2019re certain to see American and Iranian wrestlers on the same mat again in the very near future,\u201d it added. Mr. Trump\u2019s order is a complicated issue for the United States Olympic Committee, which calls itself \u201cthe steward of the Olympic movement in the United States. \u201d The organization does not want to antagonize the president, so its response has been relatively muted. The committee is invested in a bid to bring the 2024 Summer Games to Los Angeles, and that bid\u2019s chances have been damaged by the executive order, which alarmed some of the International Olympic Committee members who will select the host city. \u201cWe are disappointed for our wrestlers, who have been warmly welcomed by the Iranian public on many occasions,\u201d said Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee. Jordan Burroughs, an American who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics and who was to participate in the World Cup, told The Associated Press: \u201cThese executive decisions are always so far beyond your reach. You always feel like, \u2018Well, the presidency or these strict laws or these Muslim bans or whatever you like to call them, they\u2019ll never affect me.\u2019 This is one of the few times where something so personal has occurred. \u201d \u201cThere is such a common respect for wrestlers in Iran,\u201d Burroughs told NBC. \u201cThey love wrestling. They\u2019re huge fans of mine. I\u2019m bummed about that. I really wanted to be part of something great in what I consider a great country. Obviously, my views and our country\u2019s views are different. \u201d Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s order. But American wrestling officials had been hopeful that an exception could be made to allow the American athletes to participate.'"}, "time": 1742564548.4486132}
