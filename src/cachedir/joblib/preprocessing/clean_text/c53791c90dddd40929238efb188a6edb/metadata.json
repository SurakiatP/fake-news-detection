It takes its rightful place among the very wittiest political campaign ads. \\nProduced in Denmark for the country\u2019s Socialist People\u2019s Party ( SF ), the bus-side ad is aimed at American expats, urging them to vote in the upcoming election. It\u2019s fairly obvious who they want those people to vote for. \\nLike most of the best ads, it\u2019s as clever as it is simple. \\nIt shows Trump\u2019s unforgettably distinctive quiff and forehead but, just below it, a pair of big, googly eyes have been attached to the wheels. As the bus moves, Donald\u2019s eyes roll. \\nTalking to a local broadcaster, the SF leader Pia Olsen said : \u201cIt is meant to be a bit funny. One can\u2019t be in doubt that it was done tongue in cheek. We want to tell American citizens: Remember to vote, it has consequences.\u201d \\nAs the election draws near, both parties can be expected to increase their efforts to attract votes from the large number of U.S. citizens abroad, which amount to as many as 8.7 million. \\nTurnout among this sector is traditionally low, but it has also been proven that their input can be absolutely crucial. \\nAl Gore would have won the 2000 election by 202 votes, if the 2,490 overseas ballots had been counted in time. \\nLet\u2019s hope Americans in Denmark \u2013 and everywhere else overseas \u2013 see the serious side as well as the funny side, and make sure to get their vote in. \\nTalking of clever ads, here\u2019s one for Audi , which was deliberately planned to air during the Trump-Clinton presidential debates. It\u2019s beautifully shot and directed, but it\u2019s the line at the very end that makes it especially relevant. \\nFeatured image: Richard Foster via Flickr /Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic license Connect with me'"}, "time": 1742628493.1527882}
