When they tell the FBI they\u2019ve gone too far, well, the FBI had better listen. \\nIn an Op-Ed in the New York Times , Richard Painter, George W. Bush\u2019s White House ethics lawyer from 2005 \u2013 2007, wrote about his problems with the FBI\u2019s latest investigation of Hillary Clinton and, most surprisingly, he\u2019s taking legal action to stop it. According to Painter, it\u2019s an abuse of power. \\n(I)t would be highly improper, and an abuse of power, for the F.B.I. to conduct such an investigation in the public eye, particularly on the eve of the election. It would be an abuse of power for the director of the F.B.I., absent compelling circumstances, to notify members of Congress from the party opposing the candidate that the candidate or his associates were under investigation. It would be an abuse of power if F.B.I. agents went so far as to obtain a search warrant and raid the candidate\u2019s office tower, hauling out boxes of documents and computers in front of television cameras. \\nThe F.B.I.\u2019s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. \\nBeyond that, Painter says it\u2019s against the law, the Hatch Act in particular, to try to influence the outcome of an election. On that basis, Painter is taking action. George W. Bush's ethics lawyer filed a complaint yesterday against the FBI for violations of the Hatch Act.

I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers\u2019 ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. \\nThe Hatch Act specifically prohibits government officials, with the exception of the President, the Vice President and a handful of others from engaging in political activities. Painter is particularly concerned about the fact that FBI director James Comey has made comments about Hillary Clinton in the past, such as his statement that Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information was \u201cextremely careless.\u201d \\nWhat seems \u201cextremely careless\u201d is the way Comey has handled this investigation. \\nOn Friday, the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, sent to members of Congress a letter updating them on developments in the agency\u2019s investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, an investigation which supposedly was closed months ago. This letter, which was quickly posted on the internet, made highly unusual public statements about an F.B.I. investigation concerning a candidate in the election. The letter was sent in violation of a longstanding Justice Department policy of not discussing specifics about pending investigations with others, including members of Congress. According to some news reports on Saturday, the letter was sent before the F.B.I. had even obtained the search warrant that it needed to look at the newly discovered emails. And it was sent days before the election, at a time when many Americans are already voting. \\nPainter notes that Comey\u2019s intent doesn\u2019t matter. He violated the rules simply by taking the actions that could influence the election and frankly, there was no reason for Comey to release those emails, which aren\u2019t even directly tied to Clinton, now. \\nHe finished his op-ed with a dire warning to Americans: \\nThis is no trivial matter. We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power. Allowing such a precedent to stand will invite more, and even worse, abuses of power in the future. \\nPainter isn\u2019t alone in sharing this concern about Comey. Before these latest emails, Politico published an op-ed comparing Comey to the notorious J. Edgar Hoover , who was the first FBI director, who was perhaps best known for using questionable tactics to bring down dissidents. \\nSince taking office, Comey has repeatedly injected his views into executive branch deliberations on issues such as sentencing reform and the roots of violence against police officers. He has undermined key presidential priorities such as crafting a coherent federal policy on cybersecurity and encryption. Most recently, he shattered longstanding precedent by publicly offering his own conclusions about the FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. (The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.) \\nIt would be difficult to argue\u2014in terms of temperament, manner, or motivation\u2014that he is, or ever will be, the next J. Edgar Hoover. But increasing numbers of critics believe he has displayed a worrying disregard for the rules and norms that have constrained all but one of his predecessors, straying with blithe confidence\u2014and with increasing regularity\u2014across the fine line that separates independence from unaccountability. \\nIf nothing else, this election year has shown us something completely unprecedented and completely undemocratic. It\u2019s not just that Comey is influencing the election, he\u2019s using emails stolen by a foreign government to influence an election. As Donald Trump says, this is \u201c worse than Watergate ,\u201d just not in the way Trump thinks. \""}, "time": 1742561796.974827}
