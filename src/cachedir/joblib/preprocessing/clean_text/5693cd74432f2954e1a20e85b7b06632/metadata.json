Many have speculated about her health since that episode, and questions grew louder in September of this year when Hillary was caught on tape nearly collapsing at a 9/11 memorial event in Manhattan. \\nAfter initially blaming the health scare on \u201cdehydration,\u201d the campaign was forced to acknowledge the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia. \\n\u201cIt was unclear whether Abedin was referring to a serious ailment,\u201d the New York Post added. \\nIn January 2016, Breitbart reported: \\nDemocrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s disappearance from the debate stage last month left people speculating that the former First Lady took a long bathroom break, but now a law-enforcement source with inside connections is alleging that Clinton was missing from the stage due to health issues stemming from a previous brain injury. \\nThese long-lasting symptoms stemming from a concussion and blood clot, according to a neurologist, suggest Clinton is suffering from post-concussion syndrome, which can severely impact her cognitive abilities. \\nSource: conservativefiringline.com'"}, "time": 1742561961.0085723}
