But Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet were suggesting something else\u2014that something had gone wrong and they don\u2019t quite know what happened, but don\u2019t worry because the Times will get back to its mission of reporting truthfully. \\nBeating around the bush, they said Trump\u2019s victory was \u201cthe biggest political story of the year,\u201d which had \u201creached a dramatic and unexpected climax late Tuesday night\u2026\u201d \\nThe word \u201cunexpected\u201d means that the paper\u2019s predictions were wrong. \\nThen they said that the paper\u2019s newsroom had covered the campaign \u201cwith agility and creativity,\u201d which are terms for incompetence and bias. Some people cling to the old-fashioned idea that a paper should report events objectively. \\nPretending to reflect on the poor coverage, they finally got to the problem without saying so directly. They asked, \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d and \u201cWhat forces and strains in America drove this divisive election and outcome?\u201d \\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s \u201csheer unconventionality\u201d caused the paper to misreport what was happening. He had appealed to mysterious \u201cforces and strains,\u201d terms that apparently refer to the voters. \\nSulzberger and Baquet insisted that the Times will \u201creport America and the world honestly, without fear or favor, striving always to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in the stories that we bring to you.\u201d \\nIn other words, they blew it during the 2016 campaign and will try to do better next time. But nothing is really changing at the paper. Nobody is being fired. And nobody is being hired who has an understanding of the conservative electorate. \\nThe paper, they said, will \u201chold power to account, impartially and unflinchingly.\u201d \\nBut who will hold The New York Times accountable? \\nIn a real howler, they then claimed, \u201cWe believe we reported on both candidates fairly during the presidential campaign. You can rely on The New York Times to bring the same fairness, the same level of scrutiny, the same independence to our coverage of the new president and his team.\u201d \\nThis is another indication that the paper is hopelessly liberal, and that nothing will really change. \\nThe business as usual attitude was reflected in the front-page headline in the Times after Trump won: \u201cDemocrats, Students and Foreign Allies Face the Reality of a Trump Presidency.\u201d \\nAs Accuracy in Media Chairman Don Irvine noted , the headline was even funny to various MSNBC personalities, because it focused on the disappointment of liberals at Trump\u2019s victory, rather than the victory itself. \\nMark Halperin commented, \u201cIf a Democratic candidate who was thought to have a 10 percent chance of winning by The New York Times that ended up winning, and winning red states as Trump won blue states, I don\u2019t think that would have been the headline. And I\u2019ll just say again, the responsibility of journalists is to not report on their biases. It\u2019s to go out and understand the country through the prism of the election and say, \u2018Why are people feeling the way they\u2019re feeling?\u2019\u201d \\nOf course, the Times was not alone. \\nConsider the story in Politico headlined , \u201cInsiders: Clinton would crush Trump in November.\u201d It began, \u201cIn the swing states that matter most in the presidential race, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have a prayer against Hillary Clinton in the general election.\u201d \\nIn a story headlined, \u201cThe Democrat Media Complex Will Never Understand What Happened Tuesday Night,\u201d Stephen Kruiser at PJ Media commented that the talking heads want desperately to avoid the topic of the \u201coverwhelming lack of political and intellectual diversity in their ranks,\u201d but that the problem of their liberalism is compounded by their laziness. \\nThis is a fact, as reflected in my analysis of Post \u201cjournalist\u201d Dana Milbank, who got caught asking Democratic Party officials for help on an anti-Trump column. \\nFor his part, Milbank crafted another anti-Trump column after the Trump victory, in the form of a letter to his daughter. \u201cThis is a sad day for our country,\u201d he told her . \u201cI want you to know that I did everything I could to prevent this from happening. My efforts and those of many others came up short.\u201d \\nThose \u201cmany others\u201d were in the media and the Democratic Party, for whom Milbank worked. Perhaps Post owner Jeff Bezos ought to ask the Democrats to pay Milbank\u2019s salary. \\nMilbank told his daughter, \u201cYou are going to be okay.\u201d \\nThat\u2019s more than what we can say about Milbank. He is not okay. He is more than just a lazy liberal who gets the Democratic Party to help write his columns. He is completely out of touch with the America he claims to be writing about. \\nLike those at the Times, Milbank and others at the Post will never change. They are elitists whose hatred for their fellow Americans borders on mental illness. \\nLike other liberals, they claim to be on a crusade for \u201cthe children,\u201d in his case his daughter. It\u2019s frankly despicable that he would use his kid as a political prop. She needs our prayers.
