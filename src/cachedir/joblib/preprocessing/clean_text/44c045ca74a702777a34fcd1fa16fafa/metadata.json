That\u2019s what he thinks. I think it makes Trump better \u2014 the better choice \u2014 as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official, Hillary Clinton. Edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official, to no record as a public official. Edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions: One is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements, versus actual political policies carried out as a public official (which show Hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of Wall Street); and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a person\u2019s private or business affairs, versus a bad record as an actual public official. Only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying \u2014 and that\u2019s Clinton, not Trump, who has a horrific record as a public official. Trump has no record at all as a public official. Edlinger at 1:30 in his video says that when he contemplates voting for Hillary,\u201dThere\u2019s always one thing that comes in the way, and that\u2019s trust.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t trust her \u2014 but what he doesn\u2019t actually \u201ctrust\u201d is her words; when he says he\u2019ll vote for her, he\u2019s simply ignoring her actions, he\u2019s ignoring the real person-as-a-public-official, the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever. Proven selfishness in one\u2019s private life is bad, but proven selfishness and evil in one\u2019s public-office policies (such as \u201cWe came, we saw, he died. Ha, ha!\u201d ) is utterly disqualifying. I argued in my \u201cI\u2019m a Bernie Sanders Voter: Here\u2019s Why I\u2019ll Vote Trump\u201d , that Trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive President; but, even if he turns out to be a bad President, he won\u2019t, on balance, be as horrific as will a President Hillary Clinton. With Trump, there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world; with Clinton, there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors .'"}, "time": 1742628507.3192523}
