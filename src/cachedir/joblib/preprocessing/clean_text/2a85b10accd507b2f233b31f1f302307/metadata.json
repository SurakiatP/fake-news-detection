DENVER  \u2014   Marjorie Haun, 55, a Trump supporter living in Colorado, let me sign into her Facebook account on Friday.   protests had rocked cities  across the country, and I wanted to see what the reaction looked like to her. And so I logged in and took a spin. Her friends (she has 4, 996) had posted images of a supposed Democrat defecating on a Trump sign. Another shared a protest video  \u2014   \u201cIdiot Paid   Anarchists Yell \u2018Peaceful Protest\u2019 as they Bash Cars\u201d  \u2014   with the message, \u201cRun these vile Liberal dirtbags down! !!\u201d Others called protesters \u201cspoiled brats\u201d and urged friends to keep their guns loaded. Ms. Haun had added a video of her own  \u2014   \u201c  rioters brawl  \u2014   with each other!\u201d  \u2014   with a note: \u201cAre we having fun yet?\u201d Then I opened a new window and logged in as Meredith Dodson, 42, a Hillary Clinton supporter who lives in Washington, D. C. She has 1, 176 friends. On her feed, no one was talking about the protests. Instead, there was fear. How would women,   Latinos, immigrants, gay people and others be treated under President Trump? \u201cAs a woman and a Latina I\u2019m feeling lost and afraid,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cFriends please tell me you have my back. \u201d \u201cThis morning,\u201d another wrote, \u201cI started mentally planning how I would react if someone were to refer to me as the N word. It has already happened to 3 of my friends. \u201d Ms. Dodson had tapped out her own message: \u201cThe vast majority of my daughter\u2019s DC Public Schools PreK classmates are the children of immigrants,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are 3 and 4 year olds! I am so frightened. \u201d In some ways, the echo chamber was the winner of this election. Here we are, deeply connected. And yet red America is typing away to red America, and blue America is typing away to blue America. The day after the election, some people said the echo chamber had begun to feel like a prison. I called Ms. Haun and Ms. Dodson and thanked them for letting me hang out in their social spaces. Ms. Dodson said that she had two or three Facebook friends who supported Mr. Trump, but no   friends who did, and that she had been trying to get out of her bubble. \u201dI have this suspicion that I have no idea what\u2019s going on in the rest of white America,\u201d she said. Ms. Haun has a few friends who support Mrs. Clinton, but they largely avoid talking about politics online, she said. She was less concerned than Ms. Dodson about getting trapped in a loop of ideas. \u201cWe want to be inclusive in our echo chamber,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone wants to come in, come on in. \u201d JULIE TURKEWITZ NEW ORLEANS  \u2014   Perhaps the best way to understand \u201cthe elite\u201d that Mr. Trump railed against is to consider what it is not  \u2014   or at least how it differs from the way Clinton supporters might see it. Elite does not simply mean having a lot of money. Mr. Trump, who inherited millions, is not considered an elite sellout by his supporters any more than Edward J. Snowden is considered a tool of the government for having worked at the National Security Agency. Rather, the thinking goes, it\u2019s because Mr. Trump knows how it all works that he is in the best position to take it all apart. \u201cThe people he hung around, with all those wealthy folks and how they manipulated everything,\u201d made him uniquely qualified, said Pat Bruce, a conservative activist in the suburbs of Jackson, Miss. who grew excited about the Trump campaign when she saw that \u201che never changed what he said to fit what they wanted him to say. \u201d Elite does not necessarily mean educated, either. While university professors might be scorned as condescending eggheads, book smarts are prized when used against the bookish. While covering the 2012 Republican primary races in the Deep South, I remember conservatives crowing giddily about Newt Gingrich\u2019s ability to demolish foes in a debate. Elite is certainly not, as many on the left would argue, a function of historical advantage: being, say, a white Christian male in a country that has long made little room for anyone else. It is in some ways exactly not this. Rather, much of Mr. Trump\u2019s support arose from frustration that the majority must grant marginalized groups  \u2014   immigrants, transgender people  \u2014   particular protection and deference. Last year, the political leadership of Mississippi came out for the dedication of a   metal cross south of Jackson, an event at which speakers talked of taking a stand despite \u201cpeople coming against you, of course, your atheists, your critics. \u201d There, in the most religious state in the country, atheists are an extreme minority. But they are the ones who ignite the court battles, who mean no prayers at high school football games, who must be accommodated. This is, to many, what constitutes the elite: the people who set the cultural and societal norms, and who do so without their input or influence. Across   social media this week, some were celebrating but many others  \u2014   including the   himself  \u2014   were expressing deep frustration. Even after a stunning victory, they saw themselves being described as bigoted and unenlightened. And even with the Republicans having achieved   control of all levels of government, this remained an aggravating conundrum: The elites are still the ones who decide who gets to be elite. CAMPBELL ROBERTSON Religion is a purple state. There were indeed plenty of religious folks cheering at Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, but there were many clergy members who fought hard to elect Mrs. Clinton. White evangelicals stuck with Mr. Trump. Exit polls show that 81 percent voted for him, more than either of the past two Republican presidential candidates drew. Majorities of Mormons and white Catholics, as well as many mainline Protestants, also supported Mr. Trump, undeterred by his offensive language and harsh perspectives on Mexicans, Muslims and the disabled. In interviews this year, I often heard bewilderment and resentment from these believers at the pace of cultural and demographic change. Still reeling from last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision to legalize gay marriage, they felt pummeled this year when the Obama administration set rules for transgender students in school bathrooms. They were disturbed to see businesses setting aside prayer rooms for Muslims when Christians were not allowed to recite the Lord\u2019s Prayer at high school graduation. Mr. Trump told them he was their \u201clast chance\u201d to protect their religious liberty and limit abortion  \u2014   and many believed it. The Clinton camp included many evangelicals, but they were predominantly black, Latino, Asian and female. Her supporters also included   of Latino Catholics and four in 10 white Catholics Jews, Muslims, Sikhs and other religious minorities and those who say they have no religious affiliation. These voters are also guided by religious and moral values, but they arrive at a completely different destination than do conservatives. Their concerns are poverty, economic inequality, immigration, health care, criminal justice reform, voting rights, gay and transgender rights, reproductive choice, climate change and environmental protection. The Rev. William Barber II, a black minister and civil rights leader in North Carolina, held \u201cmoral revivals\u201d in 22 states this year with three friends: the Rev. James A. Forbes, the Rev. Traci Blackmon and Sister Simone Campbell. After the election, Mr. Barber\u2019s Twitter feed went silent until Friday, when he put out a stream of posts. \u201cThis is where we redouble our commitment to be instruments of truth, love, and justice,\u201d he wrote, rallying people of faith to lead the way in resisting the Trump administration. LAURIE GOODSTEIN A Trump supporter called me Thursday to criticize my coverage of the  \u2019s immigration policies. He pointed to it as an example of egregious bias that he said had led the news media to miss the groundswell of support that lifted Mr. Trump to victory. His tone was hostile at first, but we got to talking. The supporter, Douglas Freeman, a    retired postal worker from Knoxville, Tenn. explained why Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to raise a border wall and punish cities that protect immigrants here illegally resonated with his view of the United States as a nation under siege  \u2014   from outside and within. \u201cHe speaks with conviction and passion,\u201d Mr. Freeman said of Mr. Trump, \u201cand he is obviously an American patriot who is very upset with the political ruling class, which is selling our sovereignty out to globalism. \u201d He added: \u201cWhen he said Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo, we stood up and cheered. \u201d For Mr. Freeman, Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt immigration talk signified that he was a true rebel who would take on the powers that be, including in the Republican Party. \u201cWe have a   duopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to destroy this country by importing armies of people who will vote to keep the checks flowing from the federal government. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s paid speech to a Brazilian bank, in which she said open borders throughout the Western Hemisphere were \u201cmy dream\u201d  \u2014   an excerpt that was released by WikiLeaks  \u2014   confirmed that for Mr. Freeman. In covering immigration for The Times, I\u2019ve been to the southwest border many times in recent years. I have not seen the   boundary Mr. Freeman depicts. There are 700 miles of walls and fences, 17, 000 Border Patrol agents, and drones and aerial cameras. Homeland Security officials said last week that they were detaining more than 41, 000 immigrants and opening jails for more. Despite a surge of Central American migrants, illegal crossings are at the lowest level since the 1970s. But Mr. Freeman wants Mr. Trump to add a lot more border security to send a message to migrants to stay out, and to reassure his American supporters that the borders \u201care no longer open. \u201d He said he did not expect Mr. Trump\u2019s actions to match all the heated statements of his campaign. The wall does not have to cover remote, impassable stretches of the border, he said. He understands the country needs guest workers for agriculture. He does not expect agents to go door to door looking for immigrants to deport. But he wants Mr. Trump to cut federal funding for cities that do not cooperate with immigration authorities. And he strongly favors \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for refugees from the Middle East. \u201cWe are deliberately importing Muslims who are very intolerant and don\u2019t believe in   \u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cIf Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t deliver,\u201d he said, \u201che won\u2019t have support for very long. \u201d JULIA PRESTON In vowing to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d Mr. Trump laid bare competing visions of what America is  \u2014   or should be. For years politicians have framed the divide as Red America versus Blue America. But Mr. Trump\u2019s victory has me thinking about our national divide as a clash between Americans who prize the melting pot, and those who embrace the concept of the \u201csalad bowl. \u201d So I reached out to several women I knew. Mary Barket is 60, a Republican strategist and avid Trump supporter in Nazareth, Pa. squarely in the Rust Belt. Her grandfather emigrated from Poland shortly before World War I, joined the Army and returned to Europe to fight. He learned English and insisted his children do the same. \u201cHe was all about assimilation,\u201d she said. Mrs. Barket said she had watched with alarm as identity politics and racial divisions flourished under President Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president. She works in her church, helping run a food pantry, and once took in a black friend of her daughter\u2019s for six months. She said she approved of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, but today\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests against the police have unnerved her: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like they come from a place of peace. \u201d She has a gay cousin who is in a   relationship, but she is not enamored of the gay rights movement she says the focus should be on \u201chuman rights\u201d instead. \u201cI just don\u2019t like this striating of our culture,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we have to go back to thinking of ourselves as Americans. \u201d I met Tessa    \u2014   who is \u201c \u201d and the president of the Baltimore chapter of the N. A. A. C. P.  \u2014   while covering the unrest spurred by the death of Freddie Gray after his arrest by the police. Her grandfather, a doctor in Kentucky, was the descendant of a slave impregnated by her master. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here looking for a melting pot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were tortured and brought here. \u201d Like Mara Kiesling, 57, who began life as a boy in Harrisburg, Pa. and now fights for transgender rights in Washington, Ms.   envisions an America where differences are celebrated, not airbrushed away. Both women are terrified Mr. Trump will roll back their   rights. \u201cThe feeling that is the strongest for me this week is that this is my country,\u201d Ms. Kiesling said, \u201cand no one is going to tell me I can\u2019t be here. \u201c All of these women insist they want a unified America, and in many respects  \u2014   including their age and socioeconomic status  \u2014   they are very similar. Yet as they fight for their version of America, they could not be further apart. SHERYL GAY STOLBERG HOUSTON  \u2014   Before America had a presidential candidate who offended Latinos,   Muslims, women and the disabled, Texas had Sid Miller, the state agriculture commissioner, who compared Syrian refugees to snakes and called Mrs. Clinton an obscene term on Twitter. And Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor, who said illegal immigrants were bringing leprosy and other \u201c  diseases\u201d to Texas. And Molly White, a state lawmaker who told her staff to ask Muslims visiting her office to \u201cpublicly announce allegiance to America and our laws. \u201d And Jonathan Stickland, another state lawmaker, who in 2008 wrote on an online forum: \u201cRape is nonexistent in marriage, take what you want my friend!\u201d A candidate for the State Board of Education  \u2014   Mary Lou Bruner, a former kindergarten teacher, 69, who was pleasant when I spoke to her by phone in March  \u2014   claimed President Obama was a   gay prostitute in his youth. Chris Mapp, a candidate for Senate, referred to undocumented immigrants as \u201cwetbacks. \u201d None of this bothered Texas Republicans a great deal. There were a few apologies and statements of regret, but not much more. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters in blue America cringed at Mr. Trump\u2019s inflammatory remarks during the campaign, but his supporters throughout red America barely flinched. They were used to it. They lived in places where public figures had been making   comments for years. In red Texas in particular, I have found, the notion of being offended is regarded as a \u201cblue\u201d concept. Lance Herrington, 73, has long offended Democratic motorists on State Highway 71 in La Grange, plastering the marquee and other signs outside his classic car company with provocative slogans. He told me a story about someone he had offended with his marquee in 2012. Red America will take it one way. Blue America will take it another. After the debates between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama in 2012, his marquee read: \u201cThe Mormon won. The moron zero. \u201d He also hung a white plastic chair, a reference to Clint Eastwood\u2019s conversation with a chair during the Republican convention that year. \u201cThis minority, she was out front,\u201d he said. She later called him and threatened to turn him into the F. B. I. \u201cI said, \u2018For what?\u2019 She says, \u2018For that chair.\u2019 I said, \u2018Darling, as you can see, it\u2019s a white chair.\u2019 And she hung up on me. \u201d \u201cThe pendulum swung so far toward political correctness that you can\u2019t do anything without offending someone,\u201d he said.
