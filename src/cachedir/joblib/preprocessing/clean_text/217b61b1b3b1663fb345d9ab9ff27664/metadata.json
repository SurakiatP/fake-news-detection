She hammed it up during dance parties in her family room in Green Brook, N. J. She wore studded pink   and baked a mean cupcake. Now, Sarai, 11, is in a Get Out the Vote ad.   Miranda is praising her on Twitter. She recently attended an event for Hispanic Heritage at the White House, where she hugged the president and was in high demand for selfies, wearing a blue satin gown. \u201cIt was like a flash,\u201d Sarai said. In record time, she had gone from unknown little girl to Latina icon, all thanks to a viral music video: Sarai is the nerdy, round and confident tween who confronts bullies on the streets of Brooklyn in the video for \u201cSoy Yo\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s Me,\u201d by the Colombian group Bomba Est\u00e9reo. If you\u2019re Latina, chances are you\u2019ve already seen her. The video, released by the band last month, got a million views in its first days. (It now has more than six million.) It was featured all over, from NBC News to Fusion. It spawned a hashtag, schoolchildren\u2019\u2019s art, and animated GIFs, which in turn became memes. \u201cSoy Yo\u201d seemed to appear at precisely the right moment  \u2014   a defiant, and adorable, rebuke to the   rhetoric of the Trump campaign, and haters in general. \u201cDon\u2019t worry if they don\u2019t accept you,\u201d goes the song\u2019s chorus, in Spanish. \u201cIf they criticize you, just say, \u2018That\u2019s me.\u2019 \u201d The video resonated particularly with Latinas. Rarely in American life, especially in an era of ugly debates over immigrants, had popular culture created a young, brown,   character so heroic, free of victimhood, full of   dignity. Sarai made Latinas visible. Real Latinas. And they responded, in a chorus of \u201cyes, that\u2019s me. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that Latinos are part of American life, American space is Latino space,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Elena Cepeda, who studies Latino representations in popular culture and teaches at Williams College. \u201cRight now, that is a pretty transgressive statement. \u201d For Sarai, the video became like a home movie forever on repeat. \u201cMy mom was always checking it,\u201d Sarai said. \u201cMy dad was playing it when he was washing clothes. \u201d It all came together through a mix of accident and authenticity. Sarai\u2019s father, Juan Carlos Gonzalez, is from Costa Rica. Her mother, Diana Gonzalez, is from Peru. They came to the United States when they were about Sarai\u2019s age. Devout Catholics, they met in church. Mrs. Gonzalez is a computer analyst at a Newark hospital and Mr. Gonzalez left his job as a construction engineer to be a    father. Sarai is the oldest of their three daughters, and as a child, \u201cshe would sing everywhere. \u2018Mother Goose,\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Gonzalez said. \u201cThe microphone, that was her best friend. \u201d And she was always  . In her mostly pink bedroom, a   sign says, \u201cI am awesome!\u201d Last year, recognizing her charisma, Sarai\u2019s parents enrolled her in a program run by Actors, Models and Talent for Christ, or A. M. T. C. a Christian talent and modeling ministry. She traveled to Orlando, Fla. and was picked up by an agent in New York. But it was her father who saw the casting call for the video on an actors database. The director, Torben Kjelstrup, also entered the picture almost by chance. Mr. Kjelstrup, who lives in Copenhagen, won a contest to make the video for \u201cSoy Yo,\u201d which is off Bomba Est\u00e9reo\u2019s 2015   album, \u201cAmanecer. \u201d He didn\u2019t intend to make a political statement. He was inspired by the message of the song  \u2014   \u201cabout being yourself,\u201d he said  \u2014   and by a photo of his girlfriend from high school. \u201cShe had braces, red hair, this incredibly ugly track suit,\u201d he said. \u201cShe just had something. \u201d He pictured \u201ca story about her walking down the street, just emitting this   that rubs off on the viewer. \u201d He wanted to \u201cparaphrase a   video,\u201d so he headed to Brooklyn. (The video is shot in Williamsburg and Bushwick.) He held auditions over the summer that drew more than 100 young actors. \u201cWhen I saw Sarai,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen she was waiting, the look on her face was just priceless. \u201d It was her first role, if you don\u2019t count playing one of \u201cThe Three Little Pigs\u201d in a school production. Mr. Kjelstrup had little trouble building out her character: short overalls, Crocs, big glasses and pigtail braids. That look, paired with Sarai\u2019s attitude, was contagious. Immediately, thousands shared the video on social media many posted childhood photos. A woman who saw it in Montana, Alma Castillo, tweeted: \u201c#Soyyo you have captured my infancia! Thank you for making me feel proud! #Latina\u201d Melissa Zepeda, a student and barista in Austin, Tex. wrote on Instagram: \u201cI wish this song and video was released when I was actually around this age, when I probably needed it the most. When I was too nerdy, too American, too fat, too Mexican. \u201d Jillian B\u00e1ez, author of the forthcoming book \u201cConsuming Latinas: Latina Audiences and Citizenship,\u201d about how Latinas perceive media targeted toward them, said the response showed the therapeutic power of the video. \u201cI absolutely think it can be recuperative for Latina audiences who may not have seen themselves when they were little girls. \u201d There have been startlingly few unconventional Latinas in popular culture. \u201cUgly Betty,\u201d adapted from the Colombian telenovela \u201cYo Soy Betty, La Fea,\u201d is virtually the only nerd Google \u201cLatina girl nerds\u201d or \u201cHispanic girl nerds\u201d and the hits are for pornography. If Latinas are portrayed at all, said Isabel   author of \u201cDangerous Curves: Latina Bodies in the Media,\u201d \u201cthe expectation is that they are going to be sexual, they are going to be spectacle. \u201d Sarai\u2019s character is empowered, without any of that baggage. She drives off two snickering white girls by playing a recorder to the track of Andean panpipes. She confronts older boys, busting out dance moves learned from watching clips of Will Smith on \u201cThe Fresh Prince of  . \u201d If the video resonated most of all with Latinas, it may have been for this fluid blending of cultures, which came naturally to a little girl raised between them. \u201cWe would blast the music in our family room and my mom and dad would dance with me,\u201d Sarai said. \u201cIt was pretty funny. \u201d Lately the family has a new ritual. At night, Sarai crawls into bed with her parents to look at the latest photos fans have posted. \u201cI always cry,\u201d her mother said. At Sarai\u2019s age, Mrs. Gonzalez and her sister, recently arrived to the country from Peru, had to work in the Georgia tobacco fields with their parents. \u201cI never saw myself on television,\u201d she said. \u201cI see myself finally on the big screen. And I don\u2019t have to be a size 2 or have perfect skin or a certain color hair,\u201d she added. \u201cI can be myself. \u201d \u201cThis little girl is in every Latina woman,\u201d said her husband. When her parents get emotional, Sarai tells them what to write. \u201cWow!! You look beautiful,\u201d she wrote to the barista in Texas, who had never fit in. \u201cSarai sends a hug. \u201d Then she sent some hearts. Pink ones.'"}, "time": 1742563396.4463413}
