Camerota told her show\u2019s panelists she anticipates there is \u201cmore to come\u201d regarding sexual harassment at Fox News and explained there was little that could be done about former network executive Roger Ailes abuses at the time. \u201cLook, I was there for a long time as you all know,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know a lot about the culture and my friends there. There is a feeling that, Brian, there is more to come. This isn\u2019t the end. Just Bill O\u2019Reilly leaving. There is more to come. And in fact, we know there is still an investigation  \u2014   a justice department criminal investigation. Where do we think that might lead?\u201d \u201cI do not know that I would call it a toxic culture, but I would say that it was pervasive,\u201d Camerota added. \u201cThere was a feeling when I was there that Roger was the boss. It was Roger Ailes fiefdom. He was the king. There was no higher authority you could go to, and there was harassment. And I tried in my own way to raise the flag and talk to people about it. I went to my superiors to talk to them about it. And there was certainly a feeling of, \u2018This is Roger. What are you going to do? Who are you going to go to? \u2019\u201d She also dismissed the claim of an existence of a \u201chotline\u201d for women to call regarding this issue as well.
