[\u201cStorms get stronger and more destructive. Watch the water splash off the city,\u201d the former vice president and climate change activist warns in the trailer as newsreel footage of severe weather plays in the background. \u201cThis is global warming. \u201d  \u201cDespair can be paralyzing,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut this, to me, is the most exciting new development. We\u2019re seeing a tremendous amount of positive change. The basis is there. But it\u2019s still not enough. \u201d The trailer also features several brief excerpts of President Donald Trump\u2019s comments on global warming, and shows Gore delivering lectures and traveling around the world to survey   damage up close. Inconvenient 2 premiered as the opening night film at the Sundance Film Festival in January, reportedly drawing a standing ovation after the screening from the audience in Park City. \u201cThis movie gives me an extra burst of hope because I think   \u2026    it really effectively tells the story of how much hope is out there for transforming our energy system to become much more efficient,\u201d Gore said at the screening, according to Variety. \u201cWe are going to win this. \u201d The trailer\u2019s release came the same day President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will roll back several key energy industry regulations signed into law by former President Barack Obama. An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, with original director Davis Guggenheim returning as executive producer. Paramount Pictures will release the film on July 28.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742562124.6009448}
