Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people\u2019s choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power,\u201d Putin told a number of foreign policy experts during a meeting in the port city of Sochi in southern Russia on Thursday.\\nDemocrats in recent months have alleged that Putin favors Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump with some even accusing the latter of being a stooge for the Russians.\\nPutin said this is a ridiculous assumption and added that Moscow does not favor either candidate.\\n\u201cIf you look at the programmes of the different candidates, you get the feeling that they are all tailored in the same way, and that the differences between them are insignificant, and in reality there are no differences,\u201d he added.\\nBut the Russian president went on to say that he is willing to work with whomever does become US president toward a peaceful and stable world.\\nHe said allegations that Moscow favored Trump over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was just a way of manipulating people\u2019s emotions ahead of the elections.\\nBut both the State Department and Secretary of State John Kerry insisted on Thursday that the intelligence they had of Russian cyberattacks on US election systems was solid.\\nKerry said that Russian meddling in the US election was designed to be disruptive and \u201cannoying\u201d.\\nRelations between Russia and the US have recently been strained over their different approaches to resolving the crisis in Syria.\\nThe US has accused Russia and the Syrian government of targeting civilian areas in the besieged city of Aleppo while Moscow has accused Washington of failing to differentiate between so-called moderate rebels in the city and the Al-Qaeda affiliated Al Nusra Front.\\nSource: BRICS Post \\n'"}, "time": 1742562176.3384814}
