Mr. Trump has turned litigious after his planning permission was blocked, for golf resort in neighbouring Camberwick Green. \\nExplained Town Hall clerk, Mr Troop: \u2018Several landowners around Trumpton and Camberwick Green refused to sell their land to Trump. And he\u2019s made their lives misery, in some cases he\u2019s even cut off their water supply and blocked their roads.\u2019 Local windmill owner Windy Miller has been in dispute with Trump over the sale of land around Colley\u2019s Mill and the Trump Corporation\u2019s aggressive tactics appear to have taken their toll on the normally affable Miller. \u2018It\u2019s terrible what they\u2019ve done to Windy,\u2019 says Mr Troop. \u2018He\u2019s a broken man. Now he spends his days getting wrecked on home brew cider and firing his shotgun at anyone who comes within 100 yards of his windmill. Peter the Postman has had to visit Dr Mopp several times to have shotgun slugs removed from his rear end\u2019. \\nHowever, not everyone in Trumpton is hostile to the billionaire property developer. Local carpenter Chippy Minton believes that just as Trump is set to bring radical change to America he can do the same for Trumpton. \u2018The people are fed up with the career politicians at the town hall. Unless you\u2019re an immigrant or disabled they don\u2019t want to know, bloody do-gooders. Everyone knows there\u2019s too much immigration from neighbouring towns. We\u2019re going to build a wall around Chigley and make Chigley pay for it\u2019. \\n\u2018There\u2019s even a Mexican family moved in to Trumpton,\u2019 continued Minton. \u2018They seem nice but this type of immigration is diluting our local institutions. Take our world famous Fire Brigade for instance. Now it\u2019s \u2018Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Ramirez\u2019. What\u2019s that all about!?\u2019'"}, "time": 1742561982.3053331}
