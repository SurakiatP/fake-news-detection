Gingrich called Comey\u2019s answers \u201cpathetic\u201d and asked why he was able to verify an investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and not one about leaks to the media from within the intelligence community. \u201cWhat he said was, \u2018I\u2019m allowed to tell you there\u2019s an ongoing investigation about the Russians and the Trump campaign. I\u2019m not allowed to tell you about any investigations involving Americans who are committing felonies with up to 10 years in jail leaking secret information,\u2019\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cNow how come he could tell us the one but not tell us the other. I mean it makes no sense. \u201d \u201cI find the performance by the FBI director very, very disappointing and frankly a little alarming,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe has too much power to be as politically clever as he is. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742628481.862047}
