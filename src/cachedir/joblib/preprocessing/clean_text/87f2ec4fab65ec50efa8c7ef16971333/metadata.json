An Israeli soldier looks at the IDF\u2019s Facebook page at the army spokesperson\u2019s office in Jerusalem. \\nIsrael\u2019s ruling party used Facebook to spy on \u201canti-government\u201d journalists, Likud parliamentarian David Bitan said in a public debate Saturday. \\nBitan openly said he and others had been scouring the Facebook pages of journalists hired recently to set up a new public broadcasting service, saying they were scorned by their left-wing politics. \\n\u201cWe went and we checked the Facebook pages of these people. We saw what they are writing and I will tell you that we are talking about people who are leftist. They want to impose their own agenda on the new channel,\u201d he said in the forum. \\nBitan has been the lead crusader against the establishment of the Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation. The new radio and TV media outlet, to be launched in recent months, is slated to replace the decades-old Israel Broadcasting Authority. \\nBut Bitan and his cadre, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are looking to stop the new broadcast service, establishing a committee tasked to find a way to keep the old Israel Broadcasting Authority. \\nTheir concern? The new public service channel doesn\u2019t have enough government supervision and is overtly critical of Netanyahu\u2019s government and policies. \\nThis, despite Netanyahu calling the change \u201cessential\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d two years ago. \\nDespite this resistance, work has been underway in establishing the new outlet, with deals having been made with unions and generous severance packages being offered to workers who have agreed to quit the old broadcast voluntarily. \\nThe new media corporation has been poaching media personalities from competing outlets and preparing content for the launch date, which has already been postponed several times. \\nAnd critics are firing back at the prime minister, saying the new public broadcasting service should be free of political influence. They also see Netanyahu\u2019s actions as a clear attack on media freedom. Local media has also come out to harshly criticize the ruling party. \\nAfter Bitan\u2019s comments about surveillance became public, the Union of Journalists in Israel called on the attorney general to investigate the legality of Bitan\u2019s actions. \\n\u201cClosing down public broadcasting just because the prime minister can\u2019t control it crosses a red line reminiscent of a totalitarian regime and not a democratic society like Israel,\u201d said Yair Tarchitsky, the union\u2019s chairman. He said the government\u2019s actions amounted to McCarthyism. \\nBitan, even last week, had not been hesitant to voice his opinions about the change. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going in the direction that we want. It is clear that the corporation will be left-leaning, according to what they are talking about. The journalists and workers are talking, they are tweeting, there is a red line that we will not allow it to cross,\u201d said Bitan during an interview last week with Israel\u2019s Channel 2 news. \\nThe Israel Broadcasting Authority was first established in 1948 and was the apartheid state\u2019s sole television and radio outlet until commercial channels began broadcasting in the nineties.'"}, "time": 1742561674.94047}
