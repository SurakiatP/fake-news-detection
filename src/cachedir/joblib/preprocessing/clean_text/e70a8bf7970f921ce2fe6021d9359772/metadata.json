[\u201cPresident Barack Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\u201d Obama\u2019s spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement to reporters.  Through his spokesman, Obama also opposed discrimination against people because of their faith or religion, although he did not say that Trump\u2019s actions did so. \u201cWith regard to comparisons to President Obama\u2019s foreign policy decisions, as we\u2019ve heard before,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe president fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion. \u201d Lewis recalled the former president\u2019s final speech as president, urging Americans to \u201cbe the guardians of our democracy. \u201d \u201cCitizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize, and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake,\u201d the statement read. In November 2016, Obama was asked whether he would criticize his successor if he disagreed with him, imitating former President George W. Bush for remaining silent. \u201cI want to be respectful of the office and give the   an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance,\u201d Obama said during a press conference in Peru. But Obama specified that he would reserve the right to speak out, if he felt that Trump was affecting core American ideals. \u201c[I]f I think that it\u2019s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I\u2019ll examine it when it comes,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628447.2969787}
