USA Today reports that in the early morning hours of Saturday, the Warren County, Ohio, Democrat Headquarters received a \u201cgift\u201d from an anonymous donor. Of course, the idea of a \u201cgift\u201d is always in the eyes of the receiver. Where a farmer would have been grateful for the donation, Democrat leadership was less than thrilled with it. The gift in question: a truckload of manure. Some would view this delivery as a \u201credistribution of wealth\u201d \u2013 a truckload of manure isn\u2019t necessarily cheap. Others may see it as the public giving back what Democrats have been shoveling out for the last eight years. While this \u201cdonation\u201d is being categorized as an act of vandalism, you can\u2019t help but believe that the police officers who took the call on this \u201ccontribution\u201d had a stifled chuckle about it. There is a humorous aspect to this social commentary. \u201cWhat reasonable person thinks this is OK?\u201d Democrat Party Chair Bethe Goldenfield said in a post on social media. \u201cI won\u2019t be responding to anyone who thinks this is acceptable behavior. It is illegal !\u201d The same thing happened in 2012, Goldenfield noted. Evidently, Ms. Goldenfield doesn\u2019t appreciate the subtlety of the humor and/or the karma involved. One could argue that \u201cwhat goes around comes around.\u201d Warren County is a suburban Cincinnati county that overwhelmingly votes Republican. Mitt Romney garnered 69 percent of the vote in 2012. In fact, it\u2019s been close to 40 years since a Democrat was elected to even a countywide office. In response to the news, the chairman of the Warren County Republican Party said the GOP had nothing to do with the manure. In an act of good faith, he extended access to organization volunteers \u201cto help clean things up.\u201d That is a far cry from anything Democrats have offered in the aftermath of much more serious incidents at Republican headquarters in North Carolina and Indiana. In North Carolina, someone firebombed the Orange County GOP headquarters. In that incident, graffiti was scrawled on the side of the building warning the Republican \u201cNazis\u201d to leave the county or else. In Indiana, someone tossed a brick through the window of one local Republican headquarters. Both of these incidents \u2013 presumably executed by pro-Clinton operatives \u2013 caused extensive monetary damage. The \u201cdonation in Warren County, Ohio, caused no damage and, if Ms. Goldenfield was resourceful, she could have made a profit for the organization in selling the manure to a farmer or a garden center. These examples illustrate the fundamental differences between the Left and Right side of the aisle. Where the Right makes symbolic gestures that literally hurt no one and harm nothing, the Left firebombs and destroys property. Please tell me which party is the more civilized and intellectual party? All that Progressive enlightenment hasn\u2019t amounted to much. What do you think about campaign \u201ccontribution\u201d that was made to the Democrat Party in Ohio?
