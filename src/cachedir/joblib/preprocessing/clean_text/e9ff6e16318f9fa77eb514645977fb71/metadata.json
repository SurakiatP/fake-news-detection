McMullen arrested, charged with sexual assault/battery on a victim younger than 12 y/o. #C3N #NWFL \\n\u2014 WEAR ABC 3 (@weartv) November 2, 2016 \\nMcMullen, who has been with the FDLE for five years, worked on cases with the Gulf Coast Kids House and the Santa Rosa Kids House, centers that advocate for abused children. \\nMcMullen\u2019s position in law enforcement allowed him easy and trusted access to the children and he was able to repeatedly rape the young boys from the time they were only 7-years-old. \\nThe first boy came forward on October 28 to deputies with the Santa Rosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office (SRCSO). After the 8-year-old reported McMullen had been touching him \u201cdownstairs on his private part\u201d on a frequent basis, an investigation was launched which led to the other boy coming forward. \\nAccording to a report from WEAR, \\nThe child said the abuse began when both children were 7-years-old. He said McMuMullen made them perform sex acts like sticking their fingers in his buttocks, putting their mouth on his penis. \\nThe victim also said McMullen put his penis in the other child\u2019s buttocks at least four times, the last time being October 27. He also disclosed that McMullen made him touch the other victim\u2019s penis. \\nThe first child\u2019s interview detailing McMullen\u2019s abuse mirrored the second child\u2019s. He said some of it happened at McMullen\u2019s home. \\nThe first victim said when he told McMullen he didn\u2019t like to be touched that way, McMullen would stop. However, he\u2019d make the second victim rub his penis. \\nWhen McMullen was confronted by investigators, he reportedly began to cry and then denied touching the children sexually. \\nOne of the boys told police that the abuse went on for so long because he was afraid to come forward because McMullen told him not to tell anyone. \\nHe said McMullen told him this was \u201cbetween you and me\u201d and not to tell anybody because it would break up his relationship, according to the report. \\nIn July of this year, ABC 3 actually interviewed McMullen who was investigating a man for driving around town and exposing himself to little boys. \\n\u201cThere was a residence in Milton that was sharing images and videos of child pornography through their social media platform,\u201d said McMullen in July, likely admiring his fellow sicko. \u201cMr. Braswell indicated that he did have a sexual attraction towards children. And that he, in the past, had driven around neighborhoods in the Milton community and would expose himself to children as they would walk down the street,\u201d McMullen said. \\nSince his arrest, McMullen\u2019s bond was set at $1.5 million. However, on Wednesday that amount was reduced to only $300,000. McMullen is currently still receiving his paycheck while on administrative leave.
