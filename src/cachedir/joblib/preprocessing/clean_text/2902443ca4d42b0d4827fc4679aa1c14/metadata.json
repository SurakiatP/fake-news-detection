One Jordanian soldier was also reported wounded in the incident. \\nUnlike other recent incidents of US soldiers killed by allies, this incident was not chalked up to infiltration by rogue elements. Rather, Jordanian officials blamed the US soldiers, claiming their vehicle failed to stop at the gate to the air base and security reacted. \\nThe Pentagon was a little less cut and dry on the matter, saying they can\u2019t say for sure if it was a \u201cdeliberate\u201d attempt to kill US soldiers or some sort of misunderstanding. They say they are working with the Jordanian government to gather more details. \\nUS trainers in Jordan are there to train Syrian rebels, an operation which has been ongoing for years. Last year in November, two US contractors were killed in another incident in which a police officer opened fire on them. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz\""}, "time": 1742564218.169333}
