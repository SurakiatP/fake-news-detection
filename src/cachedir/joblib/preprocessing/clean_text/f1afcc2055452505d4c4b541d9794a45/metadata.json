He found that there has been a sea change in expectations on both sides since Oct. 7 when The Washington Post reported on the existence of the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tapes\u2026 Republicans have become increasingly concerned that they could lose statehouse majorities in as many as 10 states, Storey said\u201d [ RealClearPolitics ]. \\nThe Trail \\n\u201cClinton lead shrinks, even as nearly 6 in 10 expect her to win, Post-ABC tracking poll finds\u201d [ WaPo ]. Only one poll, so FWIW. \u201cTrump saw his biggest gains among political independents, favoring Trump by a 12-point margin in the latest tracking poll, 49 to 37 percent, after giving Clinton a narrow edge in late last week.\u201d Now that\u2019s volatile! \\nFunny: \\n\u201cClinton campaign manager John Podesta apparently thinks Eric Garner\u2019s death was justified\u201d [ Mic ]. \\nErica Garner reacts: I&#39;m troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed &quot;using&quot; Eric Garner \u2026 Why would you want to &quot;use&quot; my dad? \\n&mdash; officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 \\nCheck the responses\u2026 \\nAnd then this happened: Clinton staff wanted to use #EricGarner in oped about gun violence.

Comey informed congressional leaders Friday. The announcement appears to restart the FBI\u2019s probe of Clinton\u2019s server, which previously ended in July with no charges\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cNew Emails in Clinton Case Came From Anthony Weiner\u2019s Electronic Devices\u201d [ New York Times ]. \u201cFederal law enforcement officials said Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Anthony Weiner\u2026 The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case \u2014 one federal official said they numbered in the thousands.\u201d Then again, if Weiner runs true to form, classification won\u2019t be an issue. But that most definitely does not mean Clinton\u2019s home free . \\nQuite the Friday afternoon news dump. And not a good week for the Clinton campaign, despite the triumphalism. \\nStats Watch \\nGDP, Q3 2016 (Advance Estimate): \u201cThe consumer and the nation\u2019s exports are the headliners in third-quarter GDP which topped expectations at an annualized 2.9 percent. Personal consumption expenditures rose at a solid 2.1 percent annualized rate led by the all important durables component which surged at a 9.5 percent rate. Personal consumption was the largest contributor in the quarter, adding 1.5 percentage points to the quarter\u2019s rate.\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cAnother important positive in the report is a second straight quarter of improvement in what has been the long lagging business investment component. Contributing 0.2 percentage points to GDP, nonresidential fixed investment rose at a 1.2 percent rate on top of the second-quarter\u2019s 1.0 percent rate.\u201d But: \u201cYes of course, this is an improvement. But the consumer went limp [?], and GDP is gamed with inventory hocus-pocus and export-import adjustments. I am not a fan of quarter-over-quarter exaggerated method of measuring GDP \u2013 but my year-over-year preferred method showed moderate improvement from last quarter\u201d [ Econintersect ]. And: \u201cThe Federal Reserve has been notably uneasy surrounding investment levels in the economy with a prolonged series of weak releases, although the second-quarter data was revised higher. The third-quarter data will offer some limited relief over investment trends\u201d [ Economic Calendar ]. \\nConsumer Sentiment, October 2016: \u201c[W]eakened substantially\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201c[I]t was one year further back, September 2014, that the expectations component, at 76.8 this month, was this weak. Weakness here points to lack of confidence in the jobs outlook.\u201d \\nEmployment Cost Index, Q3 2016: \u201cYear-on-year, total costs held steady at a moderate plus 2.3 percent with wages & salaries dipping 1 tenth to 2.4 percent and benefits up 3 tenths to 2.3 percent\u201d Econoday ]. \u201cThis report, which isn\u2019t raising any red flags, is closely watched by Federal Reserve policy makers who, given the strength of the labor market, are on the look out for early signs of wage-related inflation.\u201d \\nHotels: \u201cOn the one hand, plenty data from STR , HNN\u2019s parent company, shows that things in the United States hotel industry are slowing down. Other the other hand, we have a report that September RevPAR  ;was up 5.6%. And, yes, both are true\u201d [ Hotel News Notes ]. \u201cThe great performance\u2014this was the highest RevPAR growth this year\u2014really reminded me of the better days we have seen in the past few up cycles. Of course, the results are not actually a sign of anything but a calendar shift of the Jewish holidays Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur out of September into October. So I would strongly caution against reading anything, good or bad, into these monthly numbers.\u201d \\nRail: \u201cThis week the one year rolling average did not worsen \u2013 but it remains in contraction\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nRail: \u201cTwo [CSX] trains collided head-on on a stretch of track south of Philadelphia around 8:25 a.m. Friday, leaving four people injured, according to officials\u201d (with classic photo) [ NBC Philadelphia ]. \u201cIt was not immediately clear what caused the trains to be on the same track.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cShippers, Consignees, Exporters, Importers must take heed to the packing and container transport requirements at both ends of the supply chain\u201d [ Shipping and Freight Resource ]. \u201c[I]t is clear that in this case, no one considered or was aware of the road weight limitation at the [Point of Departure] or along the route to the final destination\u2026 There would have been 2 containers that doesn\u2019t subscribe to the country\u2019s road weight limitation loose on the road.. Such instances could even result in loss of lives. this is ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS a lot of the big importers employ the services of a local freight forwarder who are au fait with these transport and documentary requirements, rules, regulations etc etc in each of their countries.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cUnited Parcel Service Inc. is forecasting record holiday shipments after traffic surged in the third quarter, spurred by rising e-commerce in the U.S. and robust growth in Asia and Europe\u201d [ Wall Street Journal , \u201cPackage-delivery company expects record shipments during holiday season as it boosts capital spending, orders new Boeing jumbo jets\u201d]. And: \u201d United Parcel Service Inc. is placing a big bet on growth in shipping demand\u201d [ Wall Street Journal ]. \u201cUPS is backing up its bullish outlook by buying 14 Boeing Co. 747-8 freighters, the company\u2019s first aircraft order since 2008. The deal pushes UPS more deeply into jumbo-jet operations at a time when international shipping demand has been soft for many companies and populist anti-trade currents seem to present new barriers to global goods movement. The company is pressing lawmakers to support new trade agreements that are drawing scorn in the presidential campaign but would bring new freight volume for its new, bigger planes. In the meantime, UPS says cross-border e-commerce is surging six times faster than the broader economy, growth that helped the company show big gains across its business lines in the third quarter.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cThe tale of two canals \u2013 game theory in action\u201d [ Splash 247 ]. Panama and Suez canals play tit-for-tat on infrastructure and pricing. \\nIT: \u201cThe latest data breach count from the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) reports that there have been 809 data breaches recorded this year through October 25, 2016, and that nearly 30 million records have been exposed since the beginning of the year\u201d [ 247 Wall Street ]. \u201d The 809 data breaches reported so far for 2016 are nearly 22% above the number reported (666) for the same period last year.\u201d Won\u2019t be a problem when we go cashless, though. \\nIT: \u201cApple demolished by Microsoft at their respective PC events\u201d [ MarketWatch ].

But developers need to have a functional keyboard to make use of that software and now they don\u2019t. Why Tim Cook, why?\u201d And: \u201cThe 2016 MacBook Pro ships with RAM and processor specs that are nearly identical to the 2010 model. Deja vu?\u201d \\nIT: \u201cApple, it seems, is angling for the \u2018amateur creative\u2019 and isn\u2019t interested in anything else anymore. It wants the market that sits in coffee shops with its brand and only buys Apple, but doesn\u2019t mind so much if the core demographic disappears. Maybe that\u2019s OK\\u200a\u2014\\u200athere\u2019s probably good money in it\\u200a\u2014\\u200abut it\u2019s a real shame\u201d [ Medium ].

The regulation, signed into law Friday, levies a fine of up to $7,500 on advertising short-term rentals of less than 30 days. This means users can still list a room in their home, but cannot advertise entire apartments.\u201d \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cRuling finds U.K. Uber drivers are workers, not self-employed\u201d [ MarketWatch ]. \u201cThe ruling by the London Central Tribunal will affect tens of thousands of drivers for the ride-sharing company, said law firm Leigh Day, which represented drivers from the GMB Union, in a statement. \u2018This judgment acknowledges the central contribution that Uber\u2019s drivers have made to Uber\u2019s success by confirming that its drivers are not self-employed but that they work for Uber as part of the company\u2019s business,\u2019 the law firm said.\u201d \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cSoylent halts sales of its powder as customers keep getting sick\u201d [ Los Angeles Times ]. \u201cBacked by more than $20 million in venture capital, Soylent has emerged as one of several popular start-ups hoping to change what and how people eat\u2026.

Drivers didn\u2019t vote for it. It has no formal collective-bargaining rights\u2026. The guild has helped bring Uber management to the table, says driver and IDG organizer Muhammad Barlas. \u201cWhen they are more comfortable, it\u2019s easier to try and negotiate with them,\u201d he says. In return, the IDG won\u2019t instigate strikes or try to get the government to treat drivers as employees with the right to unionize.\u201d Novel theory. \\n\u201c[N]ot all anticompetitive behavior shows up as monopoly\u2014a seller that utilizes its dominant market position to raise prices to customers. Sometimes, it shows up as \u2018monopsony,\u2019 when a buyer uses its dominance to underpay suppliers, such as employees. The classic example is a town where most of the residents work for a single factory or mine. The lack of competition from other employers enables the factory or mine owner to pay workers less than otherwise\u201d [ Wall Street Journal , \u201cHow Noncompete Agreements Recreate the \u2018Company Town'\u201d]. \u201cActual company towns are dying off, but virtual company towns are on the rise as shifts in the labor market may have given companies more leverage over their workers.
