That is his catchy voice on tastier sections of \u201cWho Loves You\u201d and \u201cDecember, 1963 (Oh, What a Night),\u201d both revived in the smash Broadway musical \u201cJersey Boys. \u201d Mr. Ciccone also led The Critters in the 1960s, with hits like \u201cYounger Girl\u201d and \u201cMr. Dieingly Sad,\u201d and was a musical director and bassist for Tommy James and the Shondells in the \u201990s. An obscure footnote to his extensive recording career was an unreleased batch of songs he recorded in the early 1970s with his longtime friend Brian Gari, 64, a   who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Gari wrote the songs and backed Mr. Ciccone on piano on recordings they made as demos to interest record labels. Of 20 selections, several were produced and released as complete songs, but even on the remaining sparse tracks, Mr. Ciccone\u2019s vocals shone. \u201cDon had that    kind voice and we always liked the tapes,\u201d said Mr. Gari, who hung on to those old    demo tapes for the next 45 years. He and Mr. Ciccone would occasionally prod each other to dust them off and release them as a \u201cCiccone Sings Gari\u201d album. In early October, Mr. Ciccone contacted Mr. Gari and said he planned to finally do just that, but a week later Mr. Ciccone died of a heart attack at age 70. \u201cThe week before he died, Don told me he wanted to put out the demos,\u201d Mr. Gari recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018My next project is \u2018Ciccone sings Gari. \u2019\u201d Mr. Gari said he decided to realize Mr. Ciccone\u2019s \u201clast wish,\u201d and, on a recent weekday, he was in a music studio near Union Square working with a sound engineer, Peter Millrose, to give Mr. Ciccone\u2019s remarkable vocals on the old tapes a proper setting. One number called, \u201cI Just Had to Say My Last Goodbye\u201d had the jaunty, melodic feel of Todd Rundgren, or the band Chicago in the 1970s. Working from Mr. Gari\u2019s stylistic cues, Mr. Millrose layered piano, bass and drums, and then toyed with horns, strings and other effects to punctuate Mr. Ciccone\u2019s phrasings. As Mr. Gari suggested various riffs or motifs, Mr. Millrose played them on a keyboard and added them to the digital recording until the spare track had become a slick, sturdy, fully orchestrated song. Mr. Millrose worked from sheet music of lyrics and chords written by a teenage Mr. Gari with help from his mother, who unlike Mr. Gari, had the musical training to write the melodies on music paper. Some original elements would not be preserved, like the simulated rainstorm augmenting a lover\u2019s farewell in \u201cShe Left on Good Terms. \u201d The two recorded the song in Mr. Gari\u2019s apartment and used the bathroom shower for rainfall sound effects, along with Mr. Ciccone making sounds of thunder. Mr. Gari called the project bittersweet, bringing him both the joy of hearing Mr. Ciccone\u2019s youthful voice again, but also a twinge of sadness that he was not around to participate and enjoy the results. \u201cIt had been my dream to do this album, but I never thought it would happen after he died,\u201d said Mr. Gari, who kept the tapes among a large trove of materials he has amassed in the sprawling,   apartment on West End Avenue where he has lived for more than 50 years while writing almost 1, 000 songs, several books and the music and lyrics for \u201cLate Nite Comic,\u201d which had a brief Broadway run in 1987. Mr. Gari has been married twice and held both his weddings in the apartment, which is full of memorabilia, including a vast archive of Upper West Side photos and film clips he has shot since he was in elementary school. One room is packed with items from Mr. Gari\u2019s maternal grandfather, Eddie Cantor, the movie and radio star. Shortly before his death, Mr. Cantor wrote a letter to the    Brian, praising his creativity and anointing him as \u201cthe one to carry on the tradition of show business in the family. \u201d Mr. Gari immediately began writing songs and riding the bus around Manhattan, selling his songs to music publishers. He enjoyed watching Mr. Ciccone perform with The Critters on \u201c \u201d an afternoon dance show hosted by John Zacherle, known as \u201cThe Cool Ghoul. \u201d Mr. Gari wrote an adoring fan letter to Mr. Ciccone in 1966. Mr. Ciccone wrote back and their ensuing correspondence led to a friendship. By 1971, Mr. Gari was a struggling songwriter and Mr. Ciccone was looking for his next recording contract. Mr. Gari would play him the catchy teenage love songs he had written with melodies that he described as in the \u201csunshine pop\u201d vein. Of the 20 songs they recorded, several were made into fully produced songs, including \u201cBicycle Ride,\u201d and \u201cSilent Celebration,\u201d which were issued by the Metromedia label on a 45 r. p. m. record. They recorded through 1973, when Mr. Ciccone joined the Four Seasons for a tenure that lasted through 1981. One of his Four Seasons bandmates from the era, Lee Shapiro, will produce one of the songs, Mr. Gari said. Mr. Gari said he hoped to release a CD of the 20 songs, several of which will include guitar work by his friend Dean Bailin, who played the memorable guitar fills on the 1979 hit \u201cEscape (The Pi\u00f1a Colada Song). \u201d Mr. Gari said he would be happy if the \u201cCiccone Sings Gari\u201d CD sold just enough copies to cover his recording costs. \u201cI\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s the right thing to do. I\u2019m doing this in his honor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt fulfills my dream and his last wishes. I\u2019m taking his death and making something positive out of it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564261.471111}
