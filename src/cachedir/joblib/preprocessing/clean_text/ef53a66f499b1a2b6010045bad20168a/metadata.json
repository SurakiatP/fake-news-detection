Bannon\u2019s (or, to those who wish to maximize their SEO, Steve Bannon) beliefs based on his public statements  \u2014   past interviews, speeches, and films. [From Quartz:  The three tenets of Bannonism, Bannon\u2019s political philosophy boils down to three things that a Western country, and America in particular, needs to be successful: Capitalism, nationalism, and \u201c  values. \u201d These are all deeply related, and essential. America, says Bannon, is suffering a \u201ccrisis of capitalism. \u201d (He uses the word \u201ccrisis\u201d a lot \u2014  more on that later.) Capitalism used to be all about moderation, an entrepreneurial American spirit, and respect for one\u2019s fellow Christian man. In fact, in remarks delivered to the Vatican in 2014, Bannon says that this \u201cenlightened capitalism\u201d was the \u201cunderlying principle\u201d that allowed the US to escape the \u201cbarbarism\u201d of the 20th century. Since this enlightened era, things have gradually gotten worse. (Hence the \u201ccrisis. \u201d) The downward trend began with the 1960s and \u201970s counterculture. \u201cThe baby boomers are the most spoiled, most   most narcissistic generation the country\u2019s ever produced,\u201d says Bannon in a 2011 interview. He takes on this issue in more detail in Generation Zero, a 2010 documentary he wrote and directed. The film shows one interviewee after another laying out how the \u201ccapitalist system\u201d was slowly undermined and destroyed by a generation of wealthy young kids who had their material needs taken care of by hardworking parents \u2014  whose values were shaped by the hardship of the Great Depression and World War II \u2014  only to cast off the American values that had created that wealth in the first place. This shift gave rise to socialist policies that encouraged dependency on the government, weakening capitalism. Eventually, this socialist vision succeeded in infiltrating the very highest levels of institutional power in America. \u201cBy the late 1990s, the left had taken over many of the institutions of power, meaning government, media, and academe,\u201d says Peter Schweizer, a writer affiliated with Bannon\u2019s Government Accountability Institute, a conservative think tank, in Generation Zero. \u201cAnd it was from these places and positions of power that they were able to disrupt the system and implement a strategy that was designed to ultimately undermine the capitalist system. \u201d (As he says \u201cundermine the capitalist system,\u201d the film zooms in on the word \u201cLucifer\u201d in that   epigraph from Saul Alinsky.) Underlying all of this is the philosophy of Edmund Burke, an influential   Irish political thinker whom Bannon occasionally references. In Reflections on the Revolution in France, Burke presents his view that the basis of a successful society should not be abstract notions like human rights, social justice, or equality. Rather, societies work best when traditions that have been shown to work are passed from generation to generation. The baby boomers, Bannon says in a lecture given to the Liberty Restoration Foundation (LRF) failed to live up to that Burkean responsibility by abandoning the    values of their parents (nationalism, modesty, patriarchy, religion) in favor of new abstractions (pluralism, sexuality, egalitarianism, secularism). For both Burke and Bannon, failure to pass the torch results in social chaos. Read the rest of the story here.'"}, "time": 1742563621.8265865}
