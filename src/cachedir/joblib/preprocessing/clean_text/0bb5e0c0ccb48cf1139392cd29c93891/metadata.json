There was much speculation of a romantic attachment. A few months later, Mr. Ormsby Gore, a former British ambassador to Washington, proposed marriage. She turned him down. In a handwritten letter, filled with anguish and a touch of cruelty, she explained her decision to marry Aristotle Onassis instead. \u201cIf ever I can find some healing and some comfort  \u2014   it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI can find that now  \u2014   if the world will let us. \u201d The letter was part of a set of papers found in locked   cases discovered only last month in Wales at the family home of Mr. Ormsby Gore, who died in 1985. They are being auctioned in London next month by his grandson to help restore the house. The letters point to the depth of feeling behind the public mask of one of the most celebrated women of her time. Among them is the letter to Mr. Ormsby Gore, also known as Lord Harlech, dated Nov. 13, 1968, a month after her marriage to Mr. Onassis and five months after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. In it, Mrs. Kennedy spoke of the love and bond she felt for Mr. Ormsby Gore, whose wife had died in a car crash in May 1967. \u201cWe have known so much  shared  lost so much together  \u2014   Even if it isn\u2019t the way you wish now  \u2014   I hope that bond of love and pain will never be cut. \u201d Writing from Mr. Onassis\u2019 yacht in Greece, on stationery with the ship\u2019s crest, a clear if cold message, Mrs. Kennedy told Mr. Ormsby Gore: \u201cYou are like my beloved beloved brother  \u2014   and mentor  \u2014   and the only original spirit I know  \u2014   as you were to Jack. \u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore had expressed incredulity at her choice of Mr. Onassis, and she tried to respond. \u201cPlease know  \u2014   you of all people must know it  \u2014   that we can never really see into the heart of another,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know me. And you must know that the man you write of in your letter is not a man that I could marry. \u201d Mr. Onassis, she wrote, is \u201clonely and wants to protect me from being lonely. And he is wise and kind. Only I can decide if he can, and I decided. \u201cI know it comes as a surprise to so many people,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut they see things for me that I never wanted for myself. \u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore was an old friend of John F. Kennedy, whose younger sister Kathleen, or Kick, married Mr. Ormsby Gore\u2019s first cousin. After the election of the young president in 1960, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan sent Mr. Ormsby Gore to Washington as Britain\u2019s ambassador. The two men, a year apart in age, were extremely close, and President Kennedy consulted with him on every key issue of foreign policy, especially during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and in discussions of Vietnam and nuclear disarmament. Robert Kennedy said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was \u201calmost a part of the government,\u201d adding that the president \u201cwould rather have his judgment than that of anybody else. \u201d Among the letters is one in which President Kennedy praised the ambassador: \u201cI appreciate as you know, in all these critical matters your judgment  \u2014   which I have found to be uniformly good and true. \u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore inherited the noble title, Lord Harlech, when his father died in 1964. His grandson Jasset, who inherited the title a year ago, is the one selling the papers, along with other possessions, at Bonhams, London, in an auction scheduled for March 29. Some of the letters will be on view on March 2 in New York at the Bonhams showroom, at 580 Madison Avenue. In total, there are 18 handwritten letters and one typed letter from Mrs. Kennedy to Mr. Ormsby Gore, as well as other papers. Those include a pass admitting him to the White House on Nov. 23, 1963, one day after the assassination a jocular 1963 letter from Robert Kennedy, signed \u201cBobby\u201d and instructions for pallbearers for Robert Kennedy\u2019s funeral. The papers also include a letter Mrs. Kennedy wrote to Mr. Ormsby Gore after the death of his wife, Sylvia, known as Sissie, which seemed to foreshadow his desire to marry her. \u201cYour last letter was such a cri de coeur of loneliness  \u2014   I would do anything to take that anguish from you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou want to patch the wounds  match the loose pairs  \u2014   but you can\u2019t because your life won\u2019t turn out that way. \u201d One of the most moving documents is a draft letter Mr. Ormsby Gore wrote to Mrs. Kennedy after she turned down his proposal. \u201cAll the pathetic plans I had brought with me for visits to Cyrenaica, holidays near one another and a whole variety of solutions to our marriage problem, including one for a secret marriage this summer  \u2014   plans which I saw us eagerly discussing, calmly and with complete frankness as we did at the Cape and in Cambodia for the next wonderful ten days  \u2014   all had become irrelevant trash to be thrown away within a few hours of my landing in New York,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs for your photograph I weep when I look at it. Why do such agonizing things have to happen? Where was the need for it?\u201d The Kennedys and the Ormsby Gores socialized frequently, even stirring resentment among other diplomats and members of the administration. There were small dinners at the White House and shared vacations. One   \u201cincoherent letter as written on Martini\u201d from Mrs. Kennedy, in the spring of 1962, discusses their coming vacation at the America\u2019s Cup races. Others mention her love of dance. Matthew Haley, the head of fine books and manuscripts at Bonhams, said that \u201cyou just don\u2019t get this quantity of insight into Jackie\u2019s personal life and that level of intimacy. \u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore was her husband\u2019s great friend, but \u201cthe fact that they developed such an intimate friendship in such a short space of time is important,\u201d he said, even if built on shared sadness. Contacted about the letters on Friday, a representative of the Kennedy family said that they had decided not to comment. Barbara Leaming, who has written biographies of President and Mrs. Kennedy, said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was \u201cthe pivotal relationship Jack had in the presidency,\u201d a man he trusted almost as much as Robert Kennedy. \u201cJackie loved in Jack the man he wanted to be, and David was the man helping him, in her eyes, to be the man Jack wanted to be,\u201d she said. The distress that followed Robert Kennedy\u2019s assassination in June 1968 was one reason she turned to the security of Mr. Onassis, Ms. Leaming said. \u201cIt was the second great trauma for her,\u201d Ms. Leaming said. \u201cShe was very clear it was not a marriage of love, as she said to Joe Alsop in a letter. She was seeking safety. \u201d As for Mr. Ormsby Gore, \u201cof course he fell in love with her  \u2014   she understood him so well,\u201d Ms. Leaming said. \u201cBut I have no idea if it was consummated or not. \u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore did marry again, in December 1969, to Pamela Colin, an American who bore more than a passing resemblance to Mrs. Onassis. He died in 1985, at 66, after a car crash. Mrs. Onassis attended his funeral.'"}, "time": 1742564277.8672078}
