[\u201cWomen are still so underestimated it\u2019s incredible to watch even this last election with Hillary, the kind of strong woman, the powerful woman, the educated woman, the experienced woman, being thought of as the other, or too elite, or too educated,\u201d the    icon told WNYC\u2019s Leonard Lopate on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s very, very odd to me, and it was heartbreaking for her to lose, you know?\u201d Streisand said, adding that \u201cpower and woman has always been suspect. Strong women have always been suspect in this country. \u201d Streisand spent much of the presidential campaign working to get Clinton elected and bashing   candidate Donald Trump. Two months before she promised to move to Australia if Trump won the election, the singer headlined a plush New York City fundraiser for Clinton and mocked Trump by performing a rendition of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s 1973 song \u201cSend in the Clowns. \u201d Last month, Streisand blamed the president for her weight gain. \u201cDonald Trump is making me gain weight. I start the day with liquids, but after the morning news, I eat pancakes smothered in maple syrup!\u201d she tweeted. Streisand\u2019s remarks to WNYC come just weeks after Clinton said in a speech at the Women in the World summit  that misogyny undoubtedly \u201cplayed a role\u201d in her election loss. Streisand was promoting her upcoming live performances at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on May 4th, and at Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center on May 6th.
