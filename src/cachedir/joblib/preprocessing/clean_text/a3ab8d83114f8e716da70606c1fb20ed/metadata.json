Just t his week, we reported that 60 civilians were killed, and over 200 injured during a US-led airstrike in Iraq. \\nNow, only a day later in Syria, 300 innocent civilians have died as a result of 11 different airstrikes conducted by a US-led coalition. \\nThe killings were largely absent from the major headlines in American mainstream media, but the operations were condemned by human rights organization Amnesty International. \\nThe organization stated that the US Central Command (CENTCOM) \u201cmay have\u2026 carried out unlawful attacks\u201d in Syria, killing civilians. \\nLynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International\u2019s Beirut regional office said that the CENTCOM is downplaying the human cost of the recent attacks \\n\u201cWe fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,\u201d she said. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public,\u201d she added. \\nAccording to witnesses, \u201cdouble tap\u201d airstrikes, in which the same target is attacked multiple times, ended up killing numerous first responders who were trying to save innocent victims trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings. \\nAmnesty international estimated that 300 civilians were killed in the attacks based on satellite imagery, eyewitness reports as well as media documentation from the front lines. \\n\u201cAt this point, I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him\u2026 I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me\u2026 My mother, aunt, wife and children \u2013 a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I\u2019d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,\u201d one survivor told reporters. \\n\u201cGiven the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,\u201d Maalouf of Amnesty International said. \\nThis is not the first time such a large death toll has occurred recently in Syria. Amnesty also documented that over 200 civilians were killed in a US-led attack on the city of Manbij, Syria.
