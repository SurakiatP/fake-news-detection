Kelly  \u2014   who left Fox News earlier this year to lead two news programs at NBC, including Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly  \u2014   shared a preview of her interview with Jones on her Twitter account Sunday. In the clip, Jones takes exception to being called \u201cthe most paranoid man in the world\u201d and reiterates his position that   was an \u201cinside job. \u201d Next Sunday, I sit down with conservative radio host @RealAlexJones to discuss controversies and conspiracies #SundayNight June 18 on NBC pic. twitter.   \u2014   Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 11, 2017,  As Breitbart News previously reported, the preview clip stirred outrage on social media, including from relatives of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary massacre. Jones has previously said he believes the Sandy Hook attack was a hoax. Twitter users called for a boycott of NBC News\u2019 advertisers and urged others to tune out the interview when it airs June 18. Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer for J. P. Morgan Chase, tweeted Monday that she was \u201crepulsed\u201d that NBC News would give Jones a platform on its network. As an advertiser, I\u2019m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https:  .   \u2014   Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017,  According to the Journal\u2018s report, the bank could reinstate its advertising after the interview airs June 18. The company reportedly does not want its ads appearing next to promotional material for the interview. Kelly defended her   with Jones in a tweet Sunday, saying President Donald Trump\u2019s appearance on Jones\u2019 show during the presidential campaign made the media figure newsworthy: \u201cMany don\u2019t know him our job is 2 shine a light,\u201d she tweeted. Sunday\u2019s episode of Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly will be the third broadcast of the new magazine show. Kelly kicked off her program earlier this month with a highly contentious interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The anchor is expected to begin hosting a 9 a. m. news show under NBC\u2019s Today banner in September.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742562412.7798948}
