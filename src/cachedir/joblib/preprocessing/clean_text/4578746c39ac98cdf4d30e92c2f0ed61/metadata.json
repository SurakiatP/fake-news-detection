New research has determined that he was not the first infected person in the US, however. \\nGaetan Dugas has been blamed for the appearance of AIDS in the US. However, research from the University of Arizona has exonerated Dugas, no longer the first villain in the deadly epidemic. \\nDugas was first identified as \u201c Patient Zero \u201d in Randy Shilts\u2019 1987 bestseller about the AIDS epidemic, titled \u2018And the Band Played On.\u2019 The former Air Canada flight attendant died of AIDS in 1984, but new discoveries about the genetic makeup of the AIDS virus have revealed that Dugas was not the source of the infection in the US, merely another victim of the disease during its earliest days.

Instead of originating in California and spreading eastward via Dugas, as it was long believed, the spread of AIDS was actually the opposite. \\nDugas did link cases in New York City to California and was found to carry HIV-1 sequences attributed to early mutations of the infection, but the study found \u201c no evidence that Patient O was the first person infected by this lineage. \u201d \\n\" The virus got to New York City pretty darn early ,\" Worobey told NPR. \\nDugas\u2019 reputation for being the first AIDS patient did not come from science, but rather a simple misinterpretation of the letter \u201c O. \u201d The urban legend began in the early 1980s, when behavioral scientist William Darrow was working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to try to discover what was behind the mysterious deaths of gay men in Los Angeles, NPR reported. \\nDarrow caught a break when he learned of rumors that the early cases of AIDS actually involved lovers. \\n\u201c Whoa! This is the first indication that we had that the disease might be sexually transmitted from one person to another ,\" Darrow told NPR. \\nDugas appeared on Darrow\u2019s radar when three unconnected men named him as a lover. His name was mentioned by more men, until he was connected to eight early AIDS cases. \\nWhen Darrow went to write up his findings, he coded the men\u2019s names to preserve their anonymity. The majority of them were from the Los Angeles area and were identified as such. \\n\" There was LA1, LA2 ... and so forth, \" Darrow explained. \\nBut when it came to the French-Canadian flight attendant, Dugas was identified as \"Patient O,\u201d the outside-of-California case. That is an O, as in Oscar. Not a zero. \\n\" I never labeled him Patient Zero, \u201d Darrow said.

When Shilts first read about the Canadian, he originally believed he was described as \u201c Patient O, \u201d but then heard CDC employees call him \u201c Patient Zero. \u201d \\n\u201cI thought, \\'Ooh, that\\'s catchy\u2019,\u201d he told Life magazine. \\nFrom that point onward, Dugas became known as \u201c Patient Zero \u201d in Shilts\u2019 book. Amid the panic surrounding the disease, the media ran with Dugas being to blame for the epidemic and spread misinformation that the Canadian was the first person diagnosed with the disease in the US. \\nThe fact that Dugas\u2019 HIV sequence offered little difference from the many other people who were infected at the time was often forgotten and his reputation as \u201c Patient Zero \u201d overshadowed the assistance he offered the CDC in recognizing and studying HIV, according to Darrow. \\n\" To me, there\\'s something nice about going back and correcting the record, \" Worobeysays. \" He has been blamed for things that no one should be blamed for. \"'"}, "time": 1742562092.1001477}
