Naturally, the terrorist attack in London was the primary topic of conversation. [Haney recalled appearing with Kassam on Wednesday\u2019s edition of Sean Hannity\u2019s show, where they discussed the difference between \u201cindicators that might help you get focused on the circumstances of an attack like yesterday\u201d and \u201cproven derogatory information. \u201d  \u201cYou can develop indicators in a situation like yesterday without necessarily determining whether they\u2019re really proven derogatory or not,\u201d he said. He cited the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Fort Hood, and Chattanooga as cases where \u201cthere were indicators that were seen by different law enforcement, particularly FBI, which is domestic law enforcement, and then my own former agency, Customs and Border Protection, which was our primary job Department of Homeland Security was created to help protect our country from terrorism. \u201d \u201cThe way we constructed cases, which is commonly known as \u2018connecting the dots,\u2019 was to put pieces of information into the system until a point came when you could paint a picture, either of an individual or of an organization because there was a relationship between an individual who does an attack or may do an attack and an affiliated network of either other individuals or organizations,\u201d he elaborated. Haney noted that the London attacker was evidently known to law enforcement. \u201cI also just read that they\u2019ve also arrested eight other people, which is perfect proof of my operating premise that these individuals virtually are never alone,\u201d he added. \u201cThis notion that we have of individuals that are suddenly radicalized, just kind of out of the clear blue, is really not a correct premise because as we\u2019re now discovering with the individual from the attack yesterday that there are other people involved in some way or another. It always amazes me how they\u2019re able to find this out after an attack, but it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re able to manage it quite as effectively before an attack occurs,\u201d he said. Haney thought this was a consequence of the limited \u201carena that law enforcement is allowed to operate in and how they\u2019re able to respond to indicators that they might find,\u201d not a shortage of resources. \u201cIt\u2019s been the prevailing notion that law enforcement tends to be limited in their ability to respond to the evidence that they see lately,\u201d he noted unhappily. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing these kind of vehicle attacks all the way back to Beirut, with the Marine barracks twenty, thirty years ago,\u201d Haney pointed out. \u201cAs soon as I began to see the details of the story come out in the media, the picture came clear in my mind that this is very similar to the kind of attacks we\u2019ve seen in Nice   Beirut, as I mentioned, and in Germany\u2019s Christmas market. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s another arena of indicators when you\u2019re evaluating a terrorist attack. If you\u2019re a law enforcement officer, that\u2019s your first and primary job, to try to put the picture together as quickly as you can, for one major reason: you don\u2019t know at the time of attack if that\u2019s the only person involved. You do your best to put the picture together as clearly and as quickly as possible as an indicator of a possible course of action, a response to the terrorist attack,\u201d he advised. \u201cAs an outside observer, I took the evidence that was being provided by the media  \u2014   in particular, the Guardian  \u2014   and evaluated the pictures that they had shown of the MPs, the medical people, working on the individual that had been shot. Just from that picture, I was able to make some determinations, kind of focus down on the type of person that he probably was. With my background, I knew immediately that it was likely he was affiliated with other individuals, either directly   indirectly,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt looked to me like he was going to crash through the gate if at all possible, and the smaller wall stopped him from going through,\u201d Haney assessed. \u201cYou put the picture together, and then you respond in a law enforcement manner from there. That\u2019s how I saw it as I evaluated it yesterday as the story was unfolding,\u201d he said. Haney speculated that law enforcement withheld the identity of the attacker for as long as possible to \u201ckeep the individuals that they\u2019re tracking\u201d from escaping the dragnet. He thought it was reasonable for British   units to \u201cgive themselves as much of a tactical advantage as they possibly can maintain, for as long as they can maintain it. \u201d \u201cLikely, people will go underground because that\u2019s what always happens. Remember the attacks in Brussels? There were individuals that were involved in the attack that were basically hiding in plain sight, right in communities. It took months, if not longer, to find some of them,\u201d he recalled.  \u201cThe other indicator, by the way, is what happened in the U. K. with the individuals arrested on the street or detained on the street, for asking other people in a protest questions about Islam. They intervened and took him off the street. That\u2019s kind of a variation on the \u2018see something, say something\u2019 theme, that if you do see something and say something, oftentimes you end up getting in trouble for bringing it up,\u201d Haney said.
