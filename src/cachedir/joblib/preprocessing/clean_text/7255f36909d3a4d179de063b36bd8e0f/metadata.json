Trump to reach out to minority groups, women and others who were alienated by his campaign, during the president\u2019s first news conference since Mr. Trump won the election in a stunning upset that has imperiled Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. \u201cThere are certain things that make for good sound bites but don\u2019t always translate into good policy, and that\u2019s something that I think that he and his team will wrestle with,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the White House briefing room. \u201cI did say to him, as I\u2019ve said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and the ferocity of the campaigns, that it\u2019s really important to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups, or women, or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign, and I think that\u2019s something that he will want to do. \u201d Mr. Obama also said he thought that Mr. Trump was entering office with fewer set policy ideas than other  . \u201cI don\u2019t think he is ideological,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI think ultimately he is pragmatic. \u201d Mr. Obama, who during the campaign called Mr. Trump temperamentally unfit and dangerously unqualified to be president, has since said his priority is to lead an orderly transition of power to help Mr. Trump succeed for the good of the country. He sidestepped a question about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions since his victory, including his selection on Sunday of Stephen K. Bannon, a media mogul whose website, Breitbart. com, has promoted white nationalist, racist and   views, as his chief White House strategist and senior counselor. \u201cWithout copping out, I think it\u2019s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment\u201d on Mr. Trump\u2019s personnel decisions, Mr. Obama said. The president remarked last week that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments and behavior had been more statesmanlike since the election, saying that he had been \u201cencouraged\u201d by the change in tone. Since then, the   has used Twitter to complain about postelection protests against him and object to the way The New York Times has covered him. Mr. Trump\u2019s elevation of Mr. Bannon, who was a top adviser to the campaign, has drawn scathing criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who warn that the   is placing a divisive figure with fringe views deep inside the West Wing. White House officials say Mr. Obama has not changed his view of Mr. Trump since the campaign this fall, when he condemned Mr. Trump as a bigot who had cozied up to white supremacists and could not be trusted with the nuclear codes. But Mr. Obama has told the American public that he believes the will of the voters should be respected. During a      meeting on Thursday in the Oval Office, the president tutored Mr. Trump, who has no government policy or elective experience, on a wide range of domestic and foreign policy matters he will have to deal with on his first day in office. Mr. Obama held the news conference just before departing for a weeklong trip to Greece, Germany and Peru  \u2014   his final scheduled trip abroad as president  \u2014   where he expected to face questions from anxious American allies. For months, Mr. Obama assured the allies that Mr. Trump would not win the White House. Now, he said on Monday, he will tell European allies that they should not fear for the future of NATO under a Trump presidency. In the Oval Office conversation on Thursday, Mr. Obama said, Mr. Trump \u201cexpressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships, and so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the   alliance. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561664.3499289}
