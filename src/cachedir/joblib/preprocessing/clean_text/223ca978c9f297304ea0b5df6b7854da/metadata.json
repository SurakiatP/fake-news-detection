In her short and quick statement, she carefully explained that the American people have nothing to worry about. However, without even realizing it, she incriminated herself by admitting her guilt with just ten revealing words that most people missed. \\nJust when Hillary Clinton thought she was in the clear and free from any further questions regarding her criminal behavior, the FBI found more evidence and reopened their investigation on her secret e-mail server. Instead of preparing for the upcoming election and sealing in as many last votes as she can, Hillary\u2019s been forced to redirect some of her attention on covering up her own lies. \\nDuring her press conference to address the public, she desperately tried to convince us all that there\u2019s nothing to be worried about. An unidentified reporter asked, \u201cWhat would you say to a voter who right now will be seeing you and hearing what you\u2019re saying, saying I didn\u2019t trust her before. I don\u2019t trust her anymore right now. And they\u2019re heading to the ballot box tomorrow.\u201d \\nHillary\u2019s response to this question proved her guilt with it all \u2013 and nearly everyone missed it. \u201cYou know, I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the e-mails. I think that\u2019s factored into what people think and now they are choosing a president,\u201d Hillary began, according to The Gateway Pundit . \\nHowever, her next ten words are what incriminates her. \u201cI would urge everybody to get out and vote early,\u201d Hillary said. \\nIn other words, it must be worse than we thought, and she needs her supporters to go out and vote before the investigation reveals her criminal behavior. She doesn\u2019t want the FBI to release more information and sway her supporters to vote elsewhere, ruining her chance to be president. She\u2019s guilty and desperate for votes. The only way she can secure those voters is if she convinces her mindless sheep to vote early before all of her dirty deeds become known. \\nIf I were Donald Trump, I\u2019d be doing a happy dance. The real Hillary Clinton is about to be exposed, and it\u2019s all happening mere days before the election.'"}, "time": 1742561864.3929389}
