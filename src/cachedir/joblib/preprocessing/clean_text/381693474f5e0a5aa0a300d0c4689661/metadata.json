Chicago police couldn\u2019t immediately confirm that, though a spokesman said their weekend homicide count from Friday midnight through Sunday was 18. \\nEither way, the toll surpassed the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times\u2019 analysis of holiday weekends when violence typically spikes. The Tribune reports six people were fatally shot over Memorial Day weekend, five over Fourth of July, and 13 over Labor Day . \\nThe October weekend deaths included seven people under 20 years old. Seventeen-year-old twin brothers were killed in a Sunday drive-by. \\nThere\u2019s been a spike in street violence this year with over 600 homicides already.
