Just last week, I wrote about how U.S. GDP growth numbers have been declining for three quarters in a row , and previously I wrote about how corporate defaults have surged to their highest level since the last financial crisis . Well, now we are getting some very depressing numbers from the rail industry. As you will see below, U.S. rail traffic was down more than 11 percent from a year ago in April. That is an absolutely catastrophic number, and the U.S. rail industry is feeling an enormous amount of pain right now. This also tells us that \u201cthe real economy\u201d is really slowing down, because less stuff is being shipped by rail all over the nation. \\nOne of the economic commentators that I have really come to respect is Wolf Richter of WolfStreet.com . He has a really sharp eye for   in the economy and in the financial world, and I find myself quoting him more and more as time goes by. If you have not checked out his site yet, I very much encourage you to do so. \\nOn Wednesday, he posted a very alarming article about what is happening to our rail industry. The kinds of numbers that we have been seeing recently are the kinds of numbers that we would expect if an economic depression was starting. The following is an excerpt from that article \u2026 \\nTotal US rail traffic in April plunged 11.8% from a year ago, the Association of American Railroads reported today. Carloads of bulk commodities such as coal, oil, grains, and chemicals plummeted 16.1% to 944,339 units. \\nThe coal industry is in a horrible condition and cannot compete with US natural gas at current prices. Coal-fired power plants are being retired. Demand for steam coal is plunging. Major US coal miners \u2013 even the largest one \u2013 are now bankrupt. So in April, carloads of coal plummeted 40% from the already beaten-down levels a year ago. \\nBecause rail traffic is down so dramatically, many operators have large numbers of engines that are just sitting around collecting dust. In his article, Wolf Richter shared photographs from Google Earth that show some of the 292 Union Pacific engines that are sitting in the middle of the Arizona desert doing absolutely nothing. The following is one of those photographs\u2026 \\nAs Wolf Richter pointed out, it costs a lot of money for these engines to just sit there doing nothing\u2026 \\nThese engines are expensive pieces of equipment. When they just sit there, not pulling trains, they become \u201covercapacity,\u201d and they get very expensive. Then there are engineers and other personnel who suddenly become unproductive. Some of them have already been laid off or are getting laid off. \\nAll over the world, similar numbers are coming in. For example, the Baltic Dry Index fell 30 more points on Wednesday after falling 21 on Tuesday. Global trade is really, really slowing down during the early portion of 2016. What this means on a practical level is that a lot less stuff is being bought, sold and shipped around the planet. \\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult for authorities to deny that a new global recession has begun, and at this moment we are only in the very early chapters of this new crisis. \\nAnother thing that I watch very closely is the velocity of money. When an economy is healthy, people feel pretty good about things and money tends to circulate fairly rapidly. For example, I may buy something from you, then you may buy something from someone else, etc. \\nBut when times get tough, people tend to hold on to their money more tightly, and that is why the velocity of money goes down when recessions hit. In the chart below, the shaded areas represent recessions, and you can see that the velocity of money has declined during every single recession in the post-World War II era\u2026 \\nDuring the last recession, the velocity of money declined precipitously, and that makes perfect sense. But then a funny thing happened. There was a slight bump up once the recession was over, but then it turned down again and it has kept going down ever since. \\nIn fact, the velocity of money has now dropped to an all-time low. The velocity of M2 just recently dipped below 1.5 for the first time ever. \\nThis is not a sign of an \u201ceconomic recovery\u201d. What this tells us is that our economy is very, very sick. \\nAnd we can see evidence of this sickness all around us. For instance, the Los Angeles Times is reporting that homelessness in Los Angeles increased by 11 percent last year, and this marked the fourth year in a row that homelessness in the city has increased\u2026 \\nHomelessness rose 11% in the city of Los Angeles and 5.7% in the county last year despite an intensive federal push that slashed the county ranks of homeless veterans by nearly a third, according to a report released Wednesday . \\nThe increase marks the fourth consecutive year of rising homelessness in L.A., as local officials struggle to identify funding for billion-dollar plans they approved to solve the nation\u2019s most intractable homeless problem. \\nLet us also not forget that about half the country is basically flat broke at this point. \\nJust recently, the Federal Reserve found that 47 percent of all Americans could not pay an unexpected $400 emergency room bill without selling something or borrowing the money from somewhere. \\nWith numbers such as these being reported, how in the world can anyone possibly claim that the U.S. economy is in good shape? \\nIt boggles the mind, and yet there are people out there that would actually have you believe that everything is just fine. \\nThe current occupant of the White House is one of them. \\nWith each passing month, the real economy is getting even worse. We may not have slipped into a full-blown economic depression just yet, but it is coming. \\nFor now, let us be thankful for whatever remains of our debt-fueled prosperity, because we don\u2019t deserve the massively inflated standard of living that we have been enjoying. \\nWe have been consuming far more than we produce for decades, but it won\u2019t last for much longer. And when those days are gone for good, we will mourn them bitterly.

The railroad then can write them off on insurance, problem solved. Jim Speaker \\nI bet A lot of those engines get graffitied soon. Randy \\nThe spot price of copper is too low right now to make it worthwhile. Have you ever seen how difficult it is to take wire out of a motor or generator? It\u2019s not like peeling a grape. The health of the economy of any nation can be gauged by the price of its copper. Scarcity of copper due to it being used for motors, generators and conductors in conduits makes the price go high, lack of expansion means the price will be low. Outside of industrial use and as a medium of exchange, there\u2019s not much use for copper. Except in the brass used for bullet casings. On our last scrap metal run down to the recycling place, we got $20.71 for 550 pounds of scrap iron. Pitiful. greyprepper \\nDon\u2019t go giving me ideas now! I\u2019m reformed by golly. Fiona \\nNobody tells us, but we\u2019re in a deep recession. And with either Trump or Clinton as next president, there is no hope for a change. (I really wonder if Sanders could do a better job).

Unused engines are stored in large train yards where they are kept maintained until used or sold off. I doubt they are stored in AZ as aircraft. Google photos can be years out of date. \\nI am not doubting the numbers for freight traffic decline but the photo is not evidence. Jim Speaker \\nI know where those locomotives are stored at. They are stored on the old Southern Pacific out of service Pheonix line east of Wellington,AZ. I took A picture of A few trains their back in 1996. Amtrak used to use that line. When the SP/UP merger came in 1996 it was abandond. Stephen \\nThere is 50 to 70 maybe more BNSF train engines that have been sitting near downtown Oklahoma City for the last two months or more. While I agree that it is sad about the economic state of the country I have no sympathy for that criminal fraudster Mr. billionaire himself Warren Buffet that got a bailout from the tax payers back in 2008. Yup he Berkshire Hathaway owns BNSF and Union Pacific too I believe. He makes money as those goods move down the railway. Why do you think he fights that trans atlantic pipeline because competition is a sin. Steeve Girard \\nThat means the QE money keep falling into vaults, and never comes out. Especially the Treasury vault. Once in there it can only do one thing, pay the Treasury Bonds that are coming back from the BRICS countries, which makes it disappear. The black holes they tried to fill (with QE programs) and never was able to blow it away from existence are still there, and are still doing damages to the economy. . And with the energy crisis increasing, new black hole vaults have started to appear around the world, because they are trying to decouple the US dollar from the energy sector.

SunnyFlaSnotress \\n\u201cU.S. rail traffic was down more than 11 percent from a year ago in April.\u201d Oil dropped in Nov 2014. A few months gave people time to believe the drop wasn\u2019t a blip and trucking went into higher gear with new lower gas prices, passing the savings onto the clients. Hence, trucking likely gained more popularity for shipping some items. \u201cThis also tells us that \u201cthe real economy\u201d is really slowing down\u201d It\u2019s inordinately skewed to make that statement without showing a traffic comparison chart of trucking vs railing during that timeframe. p.s. waves and kisses to my adoring fans \ud83d\ude00 Ricardo \\nStop blowing your snot everywhere you gross person SunnyFlaSnotress \\nRicardo the Beaner starts the day on a good note Bill \\nThanks for sharing your intelligence, now leave it at that and ignore the insults.

He wrote one novel, \u201cThe Illuminati\u201d about 1990 before his death. Seems a lot of what was in the book are actually being played out in events of today in the US. \\nIt will be very interesting, and seems most likely, if Trump were to chose a running mate with strong ties to inside the Beltway and spcifically (though not actually known) with the elite. In the book, the president the people wanted but the elite didn\u2019t, was forced to chose a female VP the elite wanted and then they orchestrated events such that the Pres had to step down and, wow, they still got what they wanted! Interesting times!! sistersoldier \\nWow! That is compelling! No I am not familiar with Larry Burkett but I most certainly will search to see if one of my local libraries has the novel you mentioned.

We must enjoy the simple things while they last. Thanks for the heads up! watchmannonthewall \\nIf I remember correctly Larry said, in the Forward, the only reason he wrote the book was because so many Christians were asking him to write a novel where he would lay out the events he thought would be most likely to occur to bring the anti-christ to power. When I read the book I sensed the content may have been prompted by the Holy Spirit, and Larry may have been more acccurate on events than he could have hoped for or dreamed. Funny thing is, I came across the book as a throwaway, cleaning out lockers, at an assembly plant I worked at 15 years ago. I need to get it out again and reread it. The book started with a major earthquake in Japan. sistersoldier \\nI must find it! You appear to be a fellow truth seeker and the similarities to what is going on today appear to be striking to say the least. There is just too much going on in the world today and so much has been hidden from the masses that the truth is often buried in our past or by those who were not afraid to print what the Holy Spirit was leading them to do for a time such as this!

Gay Veteran \\nnot to mention outrage overload CASTIEL \\none problem at a time friend K \\nIn my area it was defiantly the war on coal, that killed the trains. Coal trains was about all that ran on the line. In my case it was CSX that was involved. Quite a few people were laid off. Because it ended up closing a repair shop for the railroad. People do not understand why Trump has the support, he has. Simple, people are sick and tired of D.C. making decisions, that cost them their jobs. It is really just that simple. When D.C. boasts they shut down the coal industry. You will have to excuse coal men, and railroad personnel for not cheering. SmallerGovNow2 \\ngreat post k, thanks\u2026 Steeve Girard \\nEven if the coal men did decide, it would not last long, because the coal they would produce would not be in acceptable standards for the buyers, for very long. K \\nWould have to disagree, because I lived it. I live in the smoky mountains in Tn. Every winter, I could tell you how cold it was in Virginia, by how much smoke was in my area. This was from the coal fired electrical plants. Then around 2010 it all changed. The latest filters were installed on the stacks, and you know what. They worked. I seldom saw smoke during the winter. When it was cold enough. The ice went from opaque to being perfectly clear. But they had already decided to kill coal. So no amount of improvement mattered. The simple fact is. Once D.C. makes a decision, no amount of facts will make a difference. Their arrogance knows no bounds. sistersoldier \\nYes indeed \u2018K\u2019 I agree. States such as Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia(s) are all under the same mandate by the \u201cEPA\u201d (supposedly) to reduce carbon emissions 32% by the year 2030. Converting the coal plants to natural gas which is reported to be cheaper and cleaner energy is underway where I live and near completion. There are trains collecting rust in my town as well. There is also a spike in my area of solar powered energy. Solar panels and equipment sales are soaring. Currently under construction are solar powered businesses, hotels, homes, new police station and state of the art hospital. I am not surprised to see the trains parked as they say \u201cthe only thing that is constant is change.\u201d jsmith \\nCoal is an asset that this country has relied on for ages. And as you pointed out, much cleaner, and through the process of hydrogenation a cleaner gasoline than fracking can be made. I just can\u2019t understand if the Germans were relying on hydrogenation during WW2, why haven\u2019t we done it? Steeve Girard \\nIt does not matter where the mercury ends, in the environment or the filters as you say. It\u2019s the quality of coal that is the problem: it\u2019s EROEI, Coal is getting more and more costly to produce and contains more impurities with passing time. It is only a matter of time before, it\u2019s grade is not acceptable. Mark \\nGood observation and agree. mtntrek3 \\nCoal will always have a part in the energy sector, but I\u2019m not seeing it returning to levels in the days of yesteryear. I\u2019ve suffered job losses because of the downturn in coal as well. The thing is all of the shale gas production has brought natural gas cost down considerably in the country, and of course gas burns cleaner. It has an unfair advantage in that respect over coal easily. We need some suitable substitutes for the coal industry jobs lost in the country for sure. If corporate greed would stand aside to allow our jobs to come back to the country\u2026\u2026. it would be a big help. We manufacture little of what we use/consume in the country. Globalism is another factor in all of this. God help. Mike_Travis \\nCoal would be much less expensive were it not for the insane regulations that no one else in the world follows. Besides, it is NOT a function of the government to choose winners and losers in the market, nor is it within their power to CREATE losers which they frequently do. \\nGlobalism is the driving force behind all this mess which is why we are in this mess as governments everywhere WANT a collapse so they can force their criminal NWO on us all, then rule over us as subjects, NOT citizens. mtntrek3 \\nYes\u2026. globalism being pushed by the powers that be in this world the main problem. We don\u2019t need all the reg\u2019s on coal , but some are needed to keep pollution down. Nat. gas very cheap now and burns cleaner that coal that\u2019s been scrubbed\u2026\u2026.. so that\u2019s why coal is hurting so much now. Coal may make somewhat of a comeback in the future depending on what happens to gas production and geopolitical events here/worldwide. XSANDIEGOCA \\n\u201cHow did you go bankrupt?\u201d \\nTwo ways.
