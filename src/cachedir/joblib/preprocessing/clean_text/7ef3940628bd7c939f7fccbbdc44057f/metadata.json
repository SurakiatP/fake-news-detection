There\u2019s got to be a response to Podesta\u2019s email \u2013 which WikiLeaks may, or may not, leak in the next few days before the election. If the back and forth clearly shows intent (to mislead), then we\u2019ve got a 100% smoking gun: the whole Clinton (cash) machine narrative \u2013 according to which Hillary just deleted \u201cpersonal\u201d emails \u2013 crumbles like the ultimate House of Cards. \\nMoreover, that would unveil what was from the start the privileged Clinton machine strategy: to thwart the subsequent internal State Dept. and FBI investigations. \\nAs far as the Clinton machine is concerned, an interlocking influence peddling pile up is the norm. John Podesta also happens to be the founder of the Center for American Progress \u2013 a George Soros operation and prime recruiting ground for Obama administration officials, including US Treasury operatives who decided which elite Too Big To Fail (TBTF) financial giants would be spared after the 2008 crisis. DCLeaks.com , for its part, has connected Soros Open Society foundations to global funding rackets directly leading to subversion of governments and outright regime change (obviously sparing Clinton Foundation donors.) \\nExceptional bananas, anyone? \\nThe perfectly timed slow drip of WikiLeaks revelations, for the Clinton machine, feels like a sophisticated form of Chinese torture. To alleviate the pain, the relentless standard spin has been to change the subject, blame the messenger, and attribute it all to \u201cevil\u201d Russian hacking when the real source for the leaks might have come straight from the https://www.rt.com/news/365164-assange-interview-wikileaks-russia/ belly of the (Washington) beast. \\nAt the Valdai discussion club last week, it took President Putin \\nhttp://valdaiclub.com/events/posts/articles/vladimir-putin-took-part-in-the-valdai-discussion-club-s-plenary-session/ only a few sentences to debunk the whole Clinton machine narrative with a bang: \\n\u201cAnother mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police. You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth. \\nI have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people\u2019s choice? America is not some kind of \u2018banana republic\u2019, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.\u201d \\nReality, though, continues to insist on offering multiple, overlapping banana republic instances, configuring a giant black hole of transparency. \\nAnthropologist Janine Wedel has been one of the few in Clinton-linked US mainstream media \\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clintons-latest-email-scandal-why-it-deserves-scrutiny_us_58177d54e4b08301d33e0cdb?24hp9z9vxqa6y9zfr acknowledging how Bill Clinton, while Hillary was Secretary of State, perfected his version of \u201cphilantro-capitalism\u201d (actually a money laundering \u201cpay to play\u201d racket), a practice \u201cby no means confined to the Clintons\u201d. \\nAnd the racket prospered with inbuilt nuggets, such as Hillary being http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hillary-clinton-wikileaks-email-isis-saudi-arabia-qatar-us-allies-funding-barack-obama-knew-all-a7362071.html perfectly aware that prime Clinton Foundation donors Qatar and Saudi Arabia were also financing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh. \\nHuma, the Fall Princess \\nNow, less than a week before the election, we have come to the crucial juncture where the WikiLeaks revelations are merging with the FBI investigations \u2013 all three of them. \\nExhibit A is https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43150#efmABWAB8ACiACqACvADUADXAIF \\nthis WikiLeaks bombshell; Peter Kadzik, who\u2019s now in charge of the Department of Justice (DOJ) probe into the 650,000 emails found on the laptop shared by Clinton\u2019s right-hand woman Huma Abedin and her estranged, pervert husband Anthony Wiener, is a Clinton asset. \\nNot only Kadzik was an attorney for Marc Rich when he was pardoned by Bill Clinton; Podesta \u2013 as also revealed by WikiLeaks \u2013 thanked Kadzik for keeping him \u201cout of jail\u201d; and it was Kadzik who gave Podesta a secret heads up https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43150#efmABWAB8ACiACqACvADUADXAIF on the Clinton email investigation. \\nThe Clinton machine, starring a self-described virtuous Madonna, is actually a pretty nasty business. Huma and her family\u2019s close connections to Saudi Arabia \u2013 and the Muslim Brotherhood \u2013 are legendary (that includes his brother Hassan, who works for Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi). Podesta, by the way, is a handsomely remunerated lobbyist for Saudi Arabia in Washington; that\u2019s part of the Clinton Foundation connection. \\nYet now, with Huma in the spotlight \u2013 still maintaining she didn\u2019t know all those emails were in her and Wiener\u2019s laptop \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder Hillary has instantly downgraded her, publicly, to \u201cone of my aides\u201d. She used to be Hillary\u2019s ersatz http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/huma-abedin-hillary-clinton-adviser \u201cdaughter\u201d; now she\u2019s being framed as The Fall Princess. \\nAnd that brings us to the intersection of those three FBI investigations; on Hillary\u2019s Subterranean Email Server (in theory closed by FBI\u2019s Comey last summer); on the Clinton Foundation; and on Wiener\u2019s sexting of minors. The FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now. Let\u2019s try to cut a long story short. \\nFollow the evidence \\nLast July, the DOJ \u2013 under Clinton/Obama asset Loretta Lynch \u2013 decided not to prosecute anyone on Emailgate. And yet FBI director Comey \u2013 who nonetheless stressed Hillary\u2019s \u201cextreme carelessness\u201d \u2013 turbo-charged his no-denial mode on another investigation, as in the FBI \u201csought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe.\u201d \\nSoon we had Clinton Foundation FBI investigators trying to get access to all the emails turned over in the Emailgate investigation. The East District of New York refused it. Very important point; up to 2015, guess who was the US attorney at the East District; Clinton/Obama asset Lynch. \\nEnter an extra layer of legalese. Less than two months ago, the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators discovered they could not have access to any Emailgate material that was connected to immunity agreements. \\nBut then, roughly a month ago, another FBI team captured the by now famous laptop shared by Huma and Wiener \u2013 using a warrant allowing only a probe on Weiner\u2019s sexting of a 15-year-old girl. Subsequently they found Huma Abedin emails at all her accounts \u2013 from to the crucial . This meant not only that Huma was forwarding State Dept. emails to her private accounts, but also that Hillary was sending emails from the \u201csecret\u201d clintonemail.com to Huma at yahoo.com. \\nNo one knew for sure, but some of these emails might be duplicates of those the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators could not access because of the pesky immunity agreements. \\nWhat\u2019s established by now is that the metadata in the Huma/Wiener laptop was duly examined. Now picture both teams of FBI investigators \u2013 Clinton Foundation and pervert Wiener \u2013 comparing notes. And then they decide Huma\u2019s emails are \u201crelevant\u201d. \\nKey questions apply; and the most pressing is how the emails were deemed \u201crelevant\u201d if the investigators could only examine the metadata. What matters is that Comey certainly was made aware of the content of the emails \u2013 a potential game-changer. That\u2019s why one of my sources https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201610311046920348-clinton-fbi-november-surprise/ insists his decision to go public came from above. \\nThe other key question now is whether the DOJ \u2013 via Kadzik? \u2013 will once again thwart another investigation, this time on the Clinton Foundation. Senior, serious FBI agents won\u2019t take that \u2013 massive euphemism \u2013 kindly. The FBI has been on the Clinton Foundation for over a year. Now, arguably, they are loaded with evidence \u2013 and they won\u2019t quit. Winning the presidency now seems to be the least of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Bonfire of Scandals\u2019 problems.
