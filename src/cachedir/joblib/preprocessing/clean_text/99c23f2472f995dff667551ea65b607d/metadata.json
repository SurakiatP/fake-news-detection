Obviously, he lives in his big tower with his name in gold on the city\u2019s famed Fifth Avenue, but if the images of him walking into his polling place to vote for himself are any indication, what he thinks of himself isn\u2019t what the people of New York City think of him. \\nAs Trump went to vote with his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka, flanked by Secret Service agents, he was booed loudly by voters waiting in line.
