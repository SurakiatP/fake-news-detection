A campus that doesn\u2019t actually try to arrest me when I come.\u201d He continued, \u201cBefore I begin, I did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room. I hear you\u2019ve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how you\u2019re not one of these awful, terrible Trump people, that you\u2019re sensitive, and that you want to signal your virtue, so I\u2019ve brought along these safety pins, (holding up safety pins) and I also brought you something to wear them with \u2013 this diaper.\" \\nShapiro then held up a diaper, prompting huge laughs from the audience. \\nWhen a protester yelled at Shapiro that he should be \u201cwearing a swastika,\u201d Shapiro held out his yarmulke, then fired back, \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, the folks with the swastikas aren\u2019t too nice to my type.\u201d \\nShapiro continued, \u201cStop being self-indulgent children; stop pretending that everybody who voted for Trump is a vicious racist; it\u2019s your right to protest, of course, but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a duly-held election \u2026 Donald Trump doesn\u2019t care about your protest. Donald Trump is sitting somewhere in Trump Tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty, salty tears.\u201d \\nReferring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who weren\u2019t university students from attending Shapiro\u2019s lecture, Shapiro opined: \u201cI hear that a lot of folks at this publicly-funded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants. I do have a quick question: if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally, why are so many people trying to ban American citizens from this community from coming to this lecture? And by the way, I\u2019m aware of this private Facebook page titled \u2018F(***) White Supremacy: Interrupting Ben Shapiro.\\' With all due respect, \u2018F\u2019 you right back, gang.\u201d \\nAfter the applause subsided and Shapiro joked about how both Black Lives Mater and the KKK target him, the real fun began. Protesters stood up, chanting, \u201cShame\u201d over and over again. \\nShapiro quipped, \u201cWow, it\u2019s like Game of Thrones . Should I get undressed and walk down the aisle?\u201d \\nThe bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters. Shapiro addressed the protesters, saying, \u201cI\u2019m happy to talk with you,\u201d but they responded by screaming \u201csafety\u201d over and over. Shapiro joked, \u201cDid somebody fart?\u201d The crowd responded to the protesters by chanting, \u201cUSA.\u201d \\nShapiro replied, \u201cI tell you try not to be children; the first thing you do is start screaming like my two-year-old.\u201d He added, \u201cYou see, this is how conservatives actually treat people; you stand up and you interrupt and you shout \u2018Safety,\u201d and you\u2019re perfectly safe. Look at that. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d That provoked sustained applause. \\nWhen the protesters started screaming \u201cShame\u201d again, Shapiro eviscerated them, pointing out, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to pick a chant like \u2018Shame,\u2019 watch Game of Thrones first. The bad guys shout \u2018Shame.\u2019\u201d The audience loved that line. On a roll, Shapiro continued, \u201cYou\u2019re not changing anybody\u2019s mind, All you\u2019re showing everybody is that your collective IQ, if it were channeled into electricity, night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly.\u201d \\nHe continued, \u201cOkay, can we talk now, or are you going to keep shouting? Now\u2019s your chance to get it out. Let\u2019s hear your feelings. C\u2019mon. Just go for it. Or is it going to be like every thirty seconds; like an annoying microwave timer?\u201d \\nWhen the protesters resumed chanting, Shapiro responded, \u201cIf you guys want to talk, we can talk, If you want to shout, get the hell out.\u201d More applause. \\nShapiro fired, \u201cFor God\\'s sake, at least wait until I say something that offends you before getting offended.\" \\nShapiro returned to deconstructing the term \u201csocial justice.\u201d When the protesters started again, a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up, and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day, and that they should \u201cshut freaking up and listen to the man speak.\u201d That prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and Shapiro. too. He added, \u201cSee, that\u2019s what a decent, hard-working person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime, presumably.\u201d \\nShapiro returned to his speech: \u201cRacial diversity doesn\u2019t mean anything; decency means everything \u2026 Diversity isn\u2019t our strength; decency is our strength.\u201d He turned to the protesters: Remember that? Decency.\u201d \\nThe protesters screamed back, \u201cShame!\u201d Shapiro fired back, \u201cDecency!\u201d The protesters chanted \u201cShame\u201d but the crowd soon joined Shapiro in chanting \u201cDecency,\u201d shutting the protesters up. \\nAs Shapiro spoke of the falsity of \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d the protesters formed a line in front of Shapiro, prompting him to quip, \u201cIf you guys are all going to come up here, can we all just have circle time or something?\u201d \\nThe protesters chanted \u201cSafety\u201d for a minute and a half, but then the crowd started yelling back, \u201cFree speech matters.\u201d Shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters, \u201cMORONS\u201d That again prompted cheering. \\nOne member of the audience yelled to the protesters, \u201cAt least tell us what you want, or otherwise, just get out!\u201d That brought a sustained ovation. \\nAfter one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue, the protesters started shouting \u201cSafety\u201d again, then filed out, yelling \u201cF*** white supremacy\u201d while flipping off Shapiro and the entire audience. That prompted the crowd to sing, \u201cNa-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, good-bye.\u201d It also promoted this from Shapiro: \\nEven after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door. \\nAfter Shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested, as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage, or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event, he continued, \u201cAll I can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event.\u201d \\nEven after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door, prompting Shapiro to quip, \u201cDoesn\u2019t this school give homework? Does anybody have a job around here? I guess when you\u2019re majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands.\u201d \\nShapiro noted that he had engaged in a back-and-forth with one of the protesters, who accused him of being a white supremacist. When he asked her why she thought so, she replied that she got that impression from his image. He fired back, \u201cReally? Was it the yarmulke that did it for you?\u201d \\nHe took another shot at the protesters during the speech, noting that people were born unequal, and adding, \u201cSome people us are born rich; some of us are born poor; some of us are born smart; some of us are born protesters.\u201d \\nThe rest of the speech was vintage Shapiro, as was the Q&A afterward. Even the chalk was impressive: \\nWent back to the lecture hall and grabbed the EXACT piece of chalk @benshapiro used to write MORONS! #FactsNotFeelings #onlyatYAF pic.twitter.com/W0Ch06SaGR \u2014 Japheth Patterson (@japhood) November 17, 2016 \\n\\nVideo of entire event below: \\n'"}, "time": 1742561921.360053}
