Haley, described the United States on Wednesday as the \u201cmoral conscience\u201d of the world, and she dismissed the United Nations Human Rights Council as \u201cso corrupt\u201d without offering evidence. Ms. Haley said the United States would never close its doors to foreigners who flee persecution, even as she defended the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, which closed the door to refugees from six   mainly Muslim nations. She insisted that American taxpayers should get value for the money they contribute to the United Nations. She said nothing about whether the United States would help head off a potential humanitarian disaster from famine that the United Nations has warned is looming over 20 million people abroad. Ms. Haley\u2019s remarks, made at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York early Wednesday morning, were her first as ambassador to an audience of foreign policy experts. She called it \u201can intimidating crowd. \u201d She briefly channeled her boss, President Trump, by describing the United Nations as \u201cbasically a club\u201d that needed to be disrupted. \u201cThe fact is, a wave is building throughout the world,\u201d Ms. Haley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wave of populism that is challenging institutions like the United Nations, and shaking them to their foundations. \u201d Exactly how Ms. Haley proposes to disrupt the world body is not clear, beyond slashing American financial support, as Mr. Trump signaled with his budget outline. She declined to say how deep those cuts would turn out to be, saying she was in discussions with members of Congress who ultimately control the purse strings. \u201cThis is a time, in short, to show the people reasons to support the U. N.,\u201d she said. Speaking to the council, Ms. Haley took a very different tone than she had with a different audience earlier in the week. On Monday night, at a policy conference held by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the   lobbying group, Ms. Haley spoke of the utility of   shoes in diplomacy: \u201cIf I see something wrong, we\u2019re going to kick them. \u201d The remark was met with huge applause. In her remarks on Wednesday, Ms. Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, relied on familiar colloquial expressions and offered few specifics about the many foreign policy challenges facing the administration. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to call out the governments that don\u2019t have our backs,\u201d she said in her opening remarks, without naming names. \u201cThe beauty of this administration is, all bets are off,\u201d she said in response to a question. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to look at how things were done in the past. \u201d Ms. Haley mentioned, as she has before, that the administration would closely scrutinize United Nations peacekeeping efforts, and said that the United States should bear no more than 25 percent of the total costs, a reduction from the current 28 percent. She cited what she called a \u201cridiculously biased report attacking Israel,\u201d and criticized the Security Council for holding monthly meetings about the   conflict. (The council also discusses Yemen every month and Syria three times a month.) Ms. Haley demurred when asked about proposals to expand the Security Council and about how to achieve peace in Syria, except to say that the country\u2019s president, Bashar   was \u201ca big hindrance. \u201d She was not asked about two important challenges for the United Nations system, climate change and famine. She used her address to deliver a pointed attack on the United Nations Human Rights Council, the main international body meant to promote and defend human rights. \u201cI mean, the Human Rights Council is so corrupt,\u201d she said, adding that it includes \u201cbad actors\u201d who use it to protect themselves. Several countries with poor human rights records, including China and Saudi Arabia, have indeed won seats on the council. But the United States has itself used its seat to forcefully defend its allies, including Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of abuses in the war in Yemen. Ms. Haley said she would attend the Human Rights Council\u2019s June session, but declined to say whether she favored withdrawing from the body. The United States withdrew from its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights. Ms. Haley argued that the Security Council  \u2014   where the United States has a veto  \u2014   should be the United Nations body addressing human rights issues. She said she would organize a session on the topic in April when the United States takes its turn in the council\u2019s rotating presidency. The Security Council has taken up human rights in the past, and sought to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, but Russia and China blocked the move with their vetoes. Perhaps the most uncomfortable moment of Ms. Haley\u2019s speech on Wednesday came when she tried to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban. She insisted that it was not meant to exclude Muslims, but to strengthen vetting procedures for asylum seekers. At one point, she cited this month\u2019s London terrorist attack as a justification for the travel ban. The audience murmured audibly the London assailant was a   Briton.'"}, "time": 1742562072.5033684}
