[The   spot explains the origin story of the beer company\u2019s immigrant   Adolphus Busch.  The ad, titled \u201cBorn the Hard Way,\u201d begins with a young,   Busch being told, \u201cYou\u2019re not wanted here! Go back home!\u201d The big budget production eventually sees Busch land on the shores of St. Louis where he built his  . \u201cThis is the story of the original   man, one of the founders of the American Dream, making it the hard way, and his path that all came after him followed,\u201d Laura Rowan, of Budweiser\u2019s creative branch told Adweek. \u201cWe then see the words appear: \u2018When nothing will stop your dream, this is the beer you\u2019ll drink.\u2019 We end with the Budweiser logo and [tagline] \u2018This Bud\u2019s for you,\u2019\u201d she said of the ad. Ricardo Marques, vice president and executive for the Budweiser brand in the U. S. says the company\u2019s   Super Bowl ad is \u201crelevant today,\u201d in light of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program and his executive order intended to tighten security along the U. S.  border and enhance enforcement of U. S. immigration laws. \u201cIt\u2019s true, Adolphus Busch made an incredible journey to this country, and that\u2019s really what this is about. It\u2019s about his vision, his dream, everything that he doest to achieve that,\u201d Marques told AdWeek. \u201cEven though it happened in the 1850s, it\u2019s a story that is super relevant today. That\u2019s what we\u2019re honing in on it\u2019s the pursuit, the effort, the passion, the drive, the hard work, the ambition, that\u2019s really what this is about more than anything else. \u201d However, Marques insists that the ad\u2019s placement during the Super Bowl is not an attempt at making a political statement. \u201cThere\u2019s really no correlation with anything else that\u2019s happening in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe this is a universal story that is very relevant today because probably more than any other period in history today the world pulls you in different directions, and it\u2019s never been harder to stick to your guns. \u201d Despite Marques\u2019s assurance that the Super Bowl ad is not about making a political statement, his company has recently played politics with its commercials. Bud Light, another brand under the   InBev umbrella, hired and then fired   actors Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen, who starred in the beer brand\u2019s \u201cBud Light Party\u201d television  last year. One of the   ads enraged viewers, who slammed the Bud Light gender pay   commercial. What\u2019s more,   InBev, which recently cut its revenue projections for the year after reporting a consistent sales slump, invested   levels on its short TV spot. Budweiser ads typically cost between $2 million to $3 million to produce. Add the record $5 million average cost for a   Super Bowl ad, and it\u2019s easy to understand why the brewing company is hoping its $12 to $15 million commercial can spur growth in sales. Budweiser\u2019s   ad will air on FOX during Super Bowl LI on Feb. 5. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742562249.1834838}
