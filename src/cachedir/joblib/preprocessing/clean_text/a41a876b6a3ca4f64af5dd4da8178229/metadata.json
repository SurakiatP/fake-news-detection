According to the USDA in their report for fiscal year 2013, 40% of recipients are white and 26% are black. Courtesy of Travissonno.com \\nWhile the media and America\u2019s culture will have you believe that black people (or anyone who isn\u2019t white) account for copious amounts of fraud, there\u2019s a story breaking that you won\u2019t hear on Fox \u201cNews\u201d anytime soon (or you might, because any chance to crush the SNAP program, they will take). \\nAccording to WCAX News in New York: \\nMore than 30 people have been nabbed for food stamp fraud in the North Country. \\nInvestigators say over the past couple month\u2019s people used their food stamps to get food or alcohol at the Old Time Butcher Block store in Brushton. \\nPolice also say it\u2019s not the first time the owner of that store, Dennis Sauve, has been charged with allowing such fraud. \\nPolice say more arrests are expected. \\nNow here\u2019s the kicker: they\u2019re all white. Brushton, New York, where this bust happened, has a population of roughly 480 people. Approximately 99.83% of the population is white, and 0.42% are black. These demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country , Owsley Country, Kentucky, which is 99.22% white and 95% Republican. Maybe we should investigate them. \\nI just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in Brushton. \\nAccording to WPTZ News: \\nPolice say the arrests are the result of a year-long investigation, initiated by the Franklin County Department of Social Services Fraud Unit. Franklin County District Attorney\u2019s Office, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance helped with the investigation. \\nThe store owner, Denis Sauve (also white), has been charged with third-degree grand larceny and misuse of food stamps. \\nThis really isn\u2019t a racial issue so much as it is an, \u201cI told you so,\u201d issue. While the food stamp program has one of the lowest rates of abuse than any other welfare program, a lot of people buy into this misconception that it is the \u201clazy blacks\u201d who account for all the fraud and woes of government assistance. Well, here we are, a major food stamp \u201cbust\u201d and every criminal involved is white. \\nIt might be time to rethink today\u2019 stereotypes. Share this Article!
