[Stevens, whose article lavished praise on feminist author Roxanne Gay, after Gay decided to pull her book deal from Simon  Schuster in protest at the publisher awarding MILO with a $250, 000 book deal for his upcoming book \u2018Dangerous.  Having described Gay as \u201cfeminist champion\u201d who deserves a \u201cstanding ovation,\u201d Stevens went on to say that \u201cGay pulled her upcoming book from Simon  Schuster this week because the publisher signed a book deal with Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, the white nationalist who was banned from Twitter for his targeted harassment of actress Leslie Jones. \u201d However, an editors note at the bottom of the article now states that the \u201carticle has been corrected to delete a reference to Yiannopoulos as a white nationalist. \u201d During his talk at the University of Colorado Springs, MILO outlined why any form of \u2018white identity\u2019 is not the answer to the problems of identity politics. \u201cThe reality is, if you force everyone to play identity politics, if you insist in pitting whites against blacks, women against men, straights against gays, the reality is you guys are gonna win and the left isn\u2019t going to like it very much. But there\u2019s a better way. Don\u2019t fight identity politics with identity politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWhite pride, white nationalism, white supremacy isn\u2019t the way to go. The way to go is reminding them and yourselves that you should be aspiring to values and to ideas,\u201d he continued.  Other news organisations forced to issue corrections for falsely using the term \u2018white nationalist\u2019 include the LA Times, NBC News and USA Today.
