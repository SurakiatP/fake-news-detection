[According to the Independent, Stewart\u2019s wife Penny Lancaster first posted the video to her Instagram account, which showed the    \u201cMaggie May\u201d singer walking on a sand dune in the desert of Abu Dhabi with a group of friends.  At one point, one of Stewart\u2019s male friends kneels down in front of the singer, as Stewart pulls his head back with his hand and appears to make a cutting motion across the man\u2019s throat. The video was deleted from Lancaster\u2019s account but was captured by several media outlets, including TMZ.  The rocker came under fire from some fans, social media users and even the families of ISIS victims. Relatives of David Haines and Alan Henning, two British aid workers who were murdered by the ISIS terrorist known as Jihadi John, told the UK Mirror that they found the joke to be \u201cbrainless\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful. \u201d Stewart apologized in a statement, saying he had not intended to mock ISIS executions and had instead been emulating a scene from the HBO series Game of Thrones. \u201cFrom   the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road crossing to spontaneously playing out Game of Thrones, we were simply larking about \u201d he said in a statement to the Independent. \u201cUnderstandably, this had been misinterpreted and I send my deepest apologies to those who have been offended. \u201d Stewart\u2019s apology did little to quell the criticism (and sarcastic jokes) on social media. Not sure I\u2019m a great fan of Rod Stewart\u2019s new album cover, tbh. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Thomas Jones (@tomj191) March 3, 2017,  Rod Stewart, what happened, man?  \u2014   DIRTBAG LEFTIST (@coconono) March 3, 2017,  I hope I\u2019ve got the energy to perform mock executions with teenagers when I\u2019m Rod Stewart\u2019s age. I won\u2019t probably, but nice to have options,  \u2014   John Shafthauer (@hourlyterrier) March 3, 2017,  Excited to start my first day as Rod Stewart\u2019s US publicist.
