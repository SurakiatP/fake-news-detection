Even Barack Obama gave up on TPP according to The Wall Street Journal.\\nThe ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito backed the agreement, while most of the opposition boycotted the vote.The bill was sent to the Upper House for final approval, with the ruling coalition expecting it to be signed into law by November 30.\\nTPP has been one of the key points in the economic program of Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, who wanted to boost the country\u2019s exports. However, experts view the TPP approval by Japan as a more of symbolic gesture, as the deal is unlikely to ever get a green light under Trump.\\nDuring the campaign, the newly-elected president slammed the TPP, which was pushed forward by Barack Obama to limit China\u2019s economic power, calling the agreement a \u201cdisaster.\u201d\\nTPP was \u201cdead and buried,\u201d Marcel Thieliant, Japan Economist from Capital Economics, told Deutsche Welle, adding that \u201cthe upshot is that the long-term losses for Japan from the TPP not coming into force are substantial.\u201d\\nA former Chinese diplomat, now with the China Institute of International Studies, suggested that the TPP would be the \u201cfirst casualty\u201d of Trump\u2019s success.\u201cSince China isn\u2019t in that bloc, we don\u2019t have anything to lose,\u201d Ruan is cited by Reuters as saying.\\nThe demise of the TPP prompted Beijing to intensify efforts to achieving its own free trade deal in the Asia-Pacific. China\u2019s Vice Foreign Minister, Li Baodong, said that the country will be looking for support of its initiatives at the Asia-Pacific regional summit in Peru on November 19-20.\\n\u201cTrade and investment protectionism is rearing its head, and Asia-Pacific faces insufficient momentum for internal growth, and difficulties in advancing reforms,\u201d Li told journalists.\\n\u201cChina believes we should set a new and very practical working plan, to positively respond to the expectations of industry, and sustain momentum and establish a free trade area in Asia-Pacific at an early date,\u201d he added.\\nBeijing proposed the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to regulate free trade in the area.\\nAccording to Li, the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Peru confirmed Beijing\u2019s \u201cconfidence in promoting the FTAAP process.\u201d Previously, Beijing was concerned the TPP would be used by Washington to make China open it\u2019s markets by becoming part to the agreement or isolating the country from other economies in the region.\\nObama had framed TPP, which excluded China, as an effort to write Asia\u2019s trade rules before Beijing could, establishing US economic leadership in the region as part of his \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d.\\nBesides the US and Japan the TTP deal included Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.\\nThe agreement was part of Washington\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia,\u201d with Obama hoping it would establish US economic leadership in the region by formulating Asia-Pacific trade rules before Beijing does it.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742563836.7007856}
