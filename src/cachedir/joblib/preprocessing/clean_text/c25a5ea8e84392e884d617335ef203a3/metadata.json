His name, according to the police, was Andrew Jones, 57, and he had turned up in many of New York City\u2019s neighborhoods to perform his trade over the past 35 years. He carried his usual tools: three playing cards and a cardboard box. By the time a police officer saw him at 1:15 a. m. he had drawn an audience: \u201cAt least nine people crowded around the cardboard box,\u201d the officer wrote in a criminal complaint, \u201ccausing at least 20 people to have to walk off the sidewalk and onto the street to get past. \u201d Later, after Mr. Jones was arrested, his   lawyer, who was half his age, said she had never come across the particular crime he was accused of. But the officer knew right away what was happening on the sidewalk that night. \u201c\u2018  monte,\u2019\u201d she wrote. There was a time in New York when   monte dealers, like their distant and forlorn cousins, squeegee men, were a familiar sight on the streets, an annoyance to residents and a powerful lure to tourists and newcomers. The promise of easy money and the best dealers\u2019 witty patter had suckers reaching into wallets for cash they would never see again. The dealers became an endangered species with the steep drops in crime that began in the 1990s. Like lush workers, those denizens of the subways, they have not been passing down their skills to a new generation. But they are not yet extinct, as the arrest of Mr. Jones indicates. \u201cIt\u2019s the same guys,\u201d said Sgt. Gerard Caffrey of the Police Department\u2019s grand larceny division. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a crew of maybe 50 guys that do this. \u201d The earliest mentions of   monte in The New York Times date to the 1850s in articles about farmers losing fortunes to \u201can unfair game. \u201d Few heeded those words, and the game flourished. In 1992, city officials and local merchants, exasperated, led a   campaign to teach people how the fraud worked in hopes of cutting off demand, handing out fliers in Times Square. \u201cYou can\u2019t win, you won\u2019t win, you will never win,\u201d the commissioner of the Department of Business Services said at a news conference. \u201cSo don\u2019t play the game. \u201d This was around the time the magician Penn Jillette, half of Penn  Teller, walked through Times Square every day on his way to perform. He remembered first learning about the swindle in books. \u201cIt was like reading about buggy whips and   socials,\u201d he said in an interview last week. \u201cI thought it was something from Melville\u2019s time. \u201d So he was surprised at what he saw in New York. \u201cI would walk by four games from my apartment to the theater. \u201d His romantic notions about the game disappeared. \u201cThey are just thugs and this is one step from mugging,\u201d he said. The dealers usually work in teams that include lookouts and shills, or plants posing as players who win. Sergeant Caffrey witnessed that sort of team before making an arrest near Herald Square in March. \u201cThe dealer always has milk crates and a cardboard box. That\u2019s his little table,\u201d the sergeant said. The dealer has three cards, one of which, often a queen, is the winning card, and he places them facedown on the table and rearranges them. When he is done, the player bets on which one is the queen. In the March arrest, women were with the dealer, \u201cacting like they\u2019re playing the game, jumping up and down, all excited,\u201d Sergeant Caffrey said. \u201cDifferent ethnicities. It wouldn\u2019t be obvious they\u2019re together. \u201d When a stranger seeing an easy buck  \u2014   \u201cYou think you\u2019re smarter,\u201d Mr. Jillette said  \u2014   approaches to play, he is often allowed to win a hand or two, betting a little and getting twice as much in return. The stakes rise quickly  \u2014   \u201cfive dollars to 50, right away,\u201d the sergeant said  \u2014   with the dealer then subtly changing the order in which he throws down the three cards. What the player believes to be the queen is not, and the bet is lost. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much practice,\u201d Mr. Jillette said. \u201cAbout an hour. \u201d Mr. Jones has been at it much, much longer than that, the police said. He has a long criminal history that includes charges of robbery and larceny. Mostly, though, he has been arrested on charges of running   monte games  \u2014   at least 17 times since Nov. 28, 1981, in Times Square, his first arrest, the police said. He pleaded guilty to the crime committed outside the hotel in Chelsea, was sentenced to time served and was released. The location of his most recent appearance was strategic, with a   crowd of waiting clubgoers. \u201cPeople that would have 20s in their pockets, ready to go,\u201d Mr. Jillette said. \u201cPeople not at their most frugal, not at their most clear thinking. \u201d People too young to know what those fliers warned in 1992: You can\u2019t win.'"}, "time": 1742563200.5055375}
