The 31-year-old took to Instagram to share a photo of herself posed with her hands on her mega hips wearing the \u2018Respect Women #Dump Trump\u2019 shirt. ( Hey, why wasn\u2019t she arrested for causing visual pollution in Times Square? ) UK Daily Mail \u2018Respect Women,\u2019 she captioned the image. \u2018Our bodies are not for you to stare at or touch without our consent. Women are not just sexual objects, women are not here for your consumption. (One problem you don\u2019t have, cupcake) The 31-year-old took to Instagram over the weekend to share an ad of herself posing in New York City\u2019s Times Square while modeling a New Look Fashion T-shirt that reads: \u2018Respect Women #Dump Trump.\u2019 So many of us have a sexual assault story, myself included,\u2019 she continued. (Gee, were you 100 pounds lighter then?) \u2018To endorse someone who not just condones this behavior but actively engages in it would be an awful step backwards for women not just in the US but across the world. \u2018Also might I add I\u2019m NOT telling you who to vote for. Trump is a pig & that\u2019s a fact.\u2019 (But obviously, you are supporting a pig \u2013 Hillary Clinton \u2013 who has verbally abused all the women who were sexually assaulted/raped by her husband) Last week Tess made an appearance (above left) alongside model Iskra Lawrence and Orange is the New Black star Danielle Brooks at Refinery29\u2019s Every Beautiful Body Symposium in New York City, wearing a figure-hugging dress. In celebration of Halloween, Tess also posted a throwback photo of her and Nick dressed as Miss Argentina and Beetlejuice from the 1988 film. \u2018But how do I top last year?\u2019 she wrote. We pulled these costumes off in two days, and I\u2019m pretty darn proud.\u2019 There was also a fierce debate about whether or not Tess\u2019 post could be seen as an endorsement for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and some people who disagreed with her statement attacked the size 22 model for her weight. \u2018There is some super hateful stuff on here,\u2019 one woman wrote. \u2018And targeting her weight because you disagree? Really? People are crazy, keep up your positive messages Tess! Whatever your political views are, I still love what you represent!\u2019 '"}, "time": 1742564533.6571803}
