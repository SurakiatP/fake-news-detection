[\u201cHe needs to stick to the agenda,\u201d said Roger Stone, who was one of the first advisers to join Trump\u2019s campaign and remains one of his closest confidantes.  \u201cAvoid    with his critics  \u2014   just stick to the agenda  \u2014   and make at least one good reference to fake news,\u201d Stone said. Less than two months in, Stone said he is impressed by Trump\u2019s performance in the White House. \u201cI think he is doing great. \u201d Stone spoke to Breitbart News at a   book signing for his latest work: The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution at Washington\u2019s   Hotel. The diverse crowd of   men of influence, conservative operatives, and Capitol Hill staffers was a pretty strong signal that it is very important in Washington that Stone knows you bought his book. The event was organized by David Urban, the man who led Trump\u2019s campaign in Pennsylvania. \u201cRoger\u2019s always been on the cutting edge,\u201d Urban said. \u201cHe is always the guy you want on your team and I think the president was glad to have him on the team this year. \u201d Standing under a portrait of Lincoln\u2019s trusted aide and biographer John Hay, Stone told the crowd that one of the insights in his book about the 2016 campaign is its similarity to the 1948 race between Republican New York Gov. Thomas Dewey and President Harry Truman. \u201cThe more I thought about it, Hillary Clinton is really Tom Dewey without the mustache: Cold, aloof, overconfident,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile Trump is barnstorming Democratic strongholds in Michigan and Wisconsin and Western Pennsylvania  \u2014   Hillary\u2019s in Chappaqua in her pajamas looking at the swatches to pick out fabric for her Oval Office curtains,\u201d he said. Like Truman, Trump is a closer, he said. \u201cDonald Trump is the greatest closer in American politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was really a Herculean, superhuman effort. He drove himself  \u2014   largely without sleep  \u2014   on the basis of good data that said we could expand the map, we could win Michigan, we could win Wisconsin, we could win Pennsylvania and thus elect a man that I believe is destined to be one of our greatest presidents. \u201d Stone, who was a White House aide to President Richard Nixon and later introduced Nixon to Trump, told Breitbart News: \u201cBoth Nixon and Trump have obvious advantages and nobody is perfect, everyone has a flaw, but in terms of his intelligence, in terms of his speaking out for people who have been forgotten within our system, in terms of his executive ability, and in terms of his toughness and his pragmatism  \u2014   n all those ways he is like Nixon. \u201d Like Nixon, Trump is going to figure how to deal with the Washington and Republican establishments. \u201cI did look at a White House staff list yesterday and I had to stop myself  \u2014   I actually recognized a name,\u201d he said. \u201cHis greatest danger is not from the liberal Democrats. It\u2019s from establishment Republicans, who like the status quo and might seek to undermine his program  \u2014   unless of course, they determine that their program is so popular that they better get on board quick and claim they were for it the whole time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628443.3559234}
