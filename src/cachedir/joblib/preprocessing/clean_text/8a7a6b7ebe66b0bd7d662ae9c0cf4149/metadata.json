In his statements, Kallstrom exposes the Clintons as being a \u201ccrime family,\u201d adding credence to the long list of allegations against them for unethical and illegal activities throughout the last several decades. Hillary and Bill Clinton sharing a secret, Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom (inset). \\nDuring an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis, former FBI Assistant Director in Charge, New York Division, James Kallstrom, came forward with some serious statements about the Clinton family. According to Kallstrom, the FBI\u2019s original investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails was impeded by the Department of Justice and other top officials in our government. However, now that the case has been reopened, he is apparently seeing it as an opportunity to add his expert opinion and his own insider knowledge of the situation. \\nThe Hill has provided a partial transcript of Kallstrom\u2019s remarks: \\n\u201c The Clintons, that\u2019s a crime family, basically ,\u201d Kallstrom said. \u201c It\u2019s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool .\u201d \\n\u201c The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation ,\u201d he said. \u201c That\u2019s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I\u2019m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that .\u201d \\n\u201c The agents are furious with what\u2019s going on, I know that for a fact ,\u201d he said. \\nListen as former FBI Asst. Director Kallstrom speaks about why he supports Donald Trump as president and explains how he knows that Hillary Clinton would be a devastating choice to lead America. \\nAmong the many statements he made during the full ten-minute interview , perhaps this one was the most profound: \\n\u201c It\u2019s just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money. And she\u2019s a pathological liar, and she\u2019s always been a liar. And God forbid if we put someone like that in the White House. \u201d \\nGiven her extensive and tainted legal and political history, it is truly outrageous that Hillary Clinton was ever allowed to become the Democrat nominee for president to begin with. Now, she\u2019s under a second federal investigation for wrongdoing while she was serving as our Secretary of State, and shockingly, there are still those who support her. \\nShe is obviously corrupt to the core, but hopefully, over the next few days, as more information comes out, people will open their eyes and realize that Hillary\u2019s \u201ccampaign\u201d for votes is no different than any other self-serving racket she and her family have been involved in.'"}, "time": 1742563609.5165567}
