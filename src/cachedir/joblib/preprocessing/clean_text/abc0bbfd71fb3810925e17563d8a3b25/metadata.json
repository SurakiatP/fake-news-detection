The idea goes like this: Unlike many of his political rivals, Mr. Trump seems to understand that social media has become the nervous system of the American news business. On Twitter, where he regularly regales his millions of followers with   bursts of id, Mr. Trump\u2019s posts are mainlined and amplified by the rest of the media with one or two tweets, he can dominate cable TV, the web, newspapers and talk radio for an entire day. The pattern was on display again this week, when Mr. Trump blasted The New York Times over a critical story about his treatment of women. This theory is not exactly bunk. It\u2019s true that Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, with its staccato cadences and unending exclamation marks, can be irresistible even to his critics. He is among a handful of politicians who use Twitter as real people do  \u2014   casually, bitingly and free of the jargon that clogs up most other pols\u2019 tweets. Mr. Trump has also cultivated a Twitter fan base that can be domineering in its attempts to harangue and silence critics, another force multiplier in the    war for media dominance. But don\u2019t bet that Mr. Trump\u2019s mastery over social media will help him in November. He has used Twitter as a tool to foment culturewide rage  \u2014   it\u2019s his big, inescapable bullhorn. Yet winning a presidential campaign involves more than simply whipping up unfocused outrage. It also requires more discrete, personalized messaging targeted to specific sets of voters and potential volunteers, a goal for which Twitter is spectacularly ill suited. The point of a modern American presidential campaign is to inspire and turn out as many of your voters as possible while avoiding inspiring similar passion for your opponent. In 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama\u2019s campaign pioneered some of the most effective ways to use social media and   organizing to win political campaigns. The Obama operation turned unfocused online passion into a          operation whose effectiveness surprised longtime political observers. Mr. Trump has eschewed many of the Obama team\u2019s     efforts. In contrast, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has doubled down on the   approach. Veterans of the Obama campaign say this could be Mr. Trump\u2019s costliest mistake in the election. If the Internet has been Mr. Trump\u2019s secret weapon so far, it may soon turn into his Achilles\u2019 heel. \u201cThe biggest mistake he can make is thinking that the general is going to be like the primary,\u201d said David Plouffe, who managed Mr. Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign and is now an executive at Uber. Mr. Trump will need to attract voters who previously voted for Mr. Obama and those who don\u2019t usually vote at all. Compared to voters in the Republican primary, these general election voters hold more moderate views, and may be less plugged in to  \u2014   and perhaps even repulsed by  \u2014   the   hurricane of news that Mr. Trump has so far succeeded in creating. Yet Twitter, by its very nature, won\u2019t let Mr. Trump pivot to some gentler version of himself. With its character limit and an interface that\u2019s inscrutable to nonusers, Twitter tends to penalize nuance and moderation, while rewarding hot takes and bombast. Just about every discussion on the platform turns into a preening flame war, and just about any attempt to dive into substance is mocked by the platform\u2019s cool kids. In other words, Twitter is like a partisan primary election. From Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan to many of his policy ideas  \u2014   build a wall, ban Muslims  \u2014   his message has been perfectly tailored to the medium. But now, if he tries to expand his message beyond   issues for the right, Mr. Trump may feel caged in by a platform that takes a dim view of  . We\u2019re already seeing signs of this dynamic playing out. Consider  Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post to celebrate Cinco de Mayo  \u2014   a picture of himself eating a taco bowl made at Trump Tower with a caption proclaiming, \u201cI love Hispanics!\u201d That tweet ricocheted across the media  \u2014   it\u2019s his   post in months  \u2014   but not for the reasons Mr. Trump might have intended. Rather than being greeted as an honest attempt to reach out to a voting group that overwhelmingly dislikes him, the taco bowl post was widely mocked as an obvious,   pander. The failure makes sense: If there\u2019s a chance that Mr. Trump\u2019s views about Latinos are indeed more inclusive than we\u2019ve been led to believe, Twitter is the worst place for him to explain the complexities of his ideas. Twitter doesn\u2019t allow for complexity to express a move toward inclusiveness on Twitter, \u201cI love [insert demographic group]!\u201d may be the best you can do. This gets to the larger problem with Mr. Trump\u2019s reliance on social media. Twitter is effectively a mass medium in an election that may be decided by a far more personalized approach. \u201cFor example, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign will know every voter in Hamilton County, Ohio, who is certain to vote for her, and every voter who might vote for her but hasn\u2019t decided yet,\u201d Mr. Plouffe said. The campaign has collected and analyzed reams of data about those voters from public records, online interactions and   events. It can turn all that data into   action. \u201cWe found out that the more you know about who voters actually are, the better you can figure out the right person to talk to them to persuade them to go to the polls,\u201d Mr. Plouffe said. Mr. Obama won the 2012 election by 4 percentage points nationally. Mr. Plouffe estimated that without the       effort, the race would have ended in an effective tie, and Mr. Obama would have lost a few huge states, including Florida. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request to discuss how the candidate will use the Internet in his general election campaign. But in a recent interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Trump dismissed the Obama   approach. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt it was overrated,\u201d Mr. Trump told The A. P. \u201cObama got the votes much more so than his   machine. And I think the same is true with me. \u201d He said he would stick to the strategy that has worked for him so far, including holding more of his trademark crowded rallies. Buzz Jacobs, a Republican political consultant who worked on John McCain\u2019s campaign in 2008 and on Marco Rubio\u2019s run this year, said Mr. Trump would benefit from the Republican Party\u2019s     effort. But he was puzzled by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the Obama field operation. \u201cIf it\u2019s true that the campaign is going to disregard data wholesale, that would be alarming, and would leave them way behind the Clinton campaign, then we\u2019ll lose,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said. Sasha Issenberg, a journalist who chronicled the rise of   electioneering in his book \u201cThe Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns,\u201d argued Mr. Trump\u2019s approach could easily backfire. The key danger in Mr. Trump\u2019s style of campaigning, Mr. Issenberg said, was the risk of inflaming his opponents as he pushes his own message. \u201cTrump is very much a creature of mass media, and his use of Twitter fits that paradigm,\u201d Mr. Issenberg said. \u201cHe\u2019s put together as large an audience as possible. He doesn\u2019t distinguish whether these are people who vote or don\u2019t vote, whether they\u2019re in the U. S. whether they\u2019re over 18, and whether they support him or Hillary Clinton. His goal seems to be to produce content there that lands in front of as large an audience as possible. \u201d But throwing out content haphazardly is the last thing a campaign should do. \u201cIt\u2019s immensely counterproductive for him to put out a     message in front of a Hillary Clinton supporter,\u201d Mr. Issenberg said. Yet every day from now until Election Day, there\u2019s a chance that Mr. Trump will do just that. Last week, he got into a flame war with Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and lefty heroine, who was clearly trying to bait him into a fight that would energize the Democratic base. A more sober candidate might have resisted. But not a denizen of Twitter, where restraint is tantamount to defeat. Better than anyone else, Mr. Trump knows that on Twitter, you\u2019ve got to always amp it up  \u2014   even if it means turning everyone off.'"}, "time": 1742563887.0651171}
