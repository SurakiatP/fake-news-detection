I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I\\'m not proud of it.\" \\nTrump then said if you \"look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women\" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. \\nThree women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. \\n\"Mine were words \u2014 his were actions,\" Trump said. \\n\"So, don\\'t tell me about words,\" he continued. \"I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it\\'s disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\" \\nDonald Trump: \"If I win, I\\'m going to instruct my attorney general\" to investigate Clinton https://t.co/raPU4ICkl6 https://t.co/IWGVUleEtr \\n\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that \"so much of what he just said is not right\" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. \\n\"I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,\" she said. \"When they go low, you go high.\" \\n\"And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\\'s saying tonight would be understandable,\" she said. \"But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything.\" \\nShe mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. \\nClinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldn\\'t do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. \\n\"He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility,\" she said. \\nTrump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obama\\'s birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the \"33,000 emails you deleted.\" \\n\"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,\" Trump said. \"Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And we\\'re going to have a special prosecutor.\" \\nClinton said everything Trump said was \"absolutely false\" but she was \"not surprised.\" \\n\"Oh really?\" Trump interjected. \\nClinton then mentioned the difficulty in fact-checking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying \"you\\'d be in jail\" during his potential administration.'"}, "time": 1742562404.4569025}
