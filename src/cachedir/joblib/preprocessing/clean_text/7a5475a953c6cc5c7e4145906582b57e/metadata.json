And in the latest odd twist in Mr. Simmons\u2019s story, it may be a result of that podcast. Prominent Brand + Talent, a management company   by Mr. Simmons\u2019s manager of three decades, announced on Wednesday that it had acquired exclusive rights to represent Mr. Simmons for merchandising, endorsements and licensing opportunities. The trade publication License first reported the deal. Michael Catalano, Mr. Simmons\u2019s manager, said in an interview that Mr. Simmons might be willing to come out of his   exile to help promote products that result from the deal. If Mr. Simmons does appear in public, it would be the first time he has done so since February 2014, when he stopped showing up to teach his class at Slimmons, his gym in Beverly Hills, Calif. He abruptly became a recluse and has not been seen since, spurring concerns about his  . \u201cAll I can say, at least for now, is it is possible,\u201d Mr. Catalano said of whether Mr. Simmons would get involved publicly. \u201cBut it is yet to be determined, I would say. \u201d Mr. Catalano added that Mr. Simmons was directly involved in pursuing the deal, and noted that   products would \u201cbe in keeping with Richard\u2019s lifelong mission and messaging. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about   products that will hopefully accomplish what Richard really set his life\u2019s work to do, which is to help people take better care of themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not licensing tires and party hats. \u201d Dan Taberski, a former producer for \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and a friend of Mr. Simmons, set out to solve the mystery of what happened to the obstreperous crusader for exercise in a   podcast series, \u201cMissing Richard Simmons. \u201d It quickly became the most downloaded podcast on iTunes but also attracted criticism, drawing complaints that it was violating Mr. Simmons\u2019s privacy. Mr. Taberski never got to talk to Mr. Simmons but was able to interview Mr. Catalano, who said in the podcast\u2019s last episode: \u201cI can\u2019t say Richard feels better as a result of the podcast. Perhaps you do. \u201d But the podcast did create new interest in Mr. Simmons, spurring this pursuit of new business deals. It put Mr. Simmons \u201cfront and center,\u201d as Mr. Catalano said, which gave Mr. Taberski some solace. \u201cTelling his story was a huge part of the podcast,\u201d Mr. Taberski said in an interview. \u201cHe changed lives, and he\u2019s a genius businessperson. If I had even the smallest part in reminding people of that, fantastic. \u201d Mr. Simmons\u2019s representatives were critical of the podcast throughout its run, citing multiple welfare checks from the Los Angeles Police Department that showed Mr. Simmons to be in good health. \u201cI\u2019m very conflicted about the podcast,\u201d Mr. Catalano said. \u201cI was not happy with a lot of the mistruths that were represented there. It also didn\u2019t really uncover or reveal anything new that hasn\u2019t been reported previously. And I think in many ways that was difficult for Richard to have to live through again. \u201d But \u201cMissing Richard Simmons\u201d did have a silver lining for Mr. Catalano. \u201cCertainly I would say, without a doubt, a younger demo is aware of Richard as a result,\u201d Mr. Catalano said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if it helps deliver his message to people who were unaware of it previously, fantastic. That\u2019s what Richard\u2019s mission has always been. \u201d Mr. Simmons, through Mr. Catalano, declined a request for an interview.'"}, "time": 1742561976.4244218}
