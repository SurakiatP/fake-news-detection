[The Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) the secularist main opposition party, has demanded a recount. On Sunday, the Turkish newspaper Sabah, which typically published   stories, reported that the CHP would seek recounts of up to 40 percent of the votes cast, alleging that bribery and intimidation had occurred to keep the \u201cyes\u201d votes high. Reuters had reported the CHP\u2019s recount demands to be higher  \u2014   a 60 percent vote recount  \u2014   arguing that a number of unverified ballots had made their way into the vote totals.  The Turkish Supreme Election Board (YSK) the electoral oversight agency, had announced it would count as valid unverified ballots lacking an official YSK stamp required from the voting stations, unless individual claims of fraud arose against them. \u201cThis referendum will always be remembered as illegitimate,\u201d CHP deputy leader B\u00fclent Tezcan argued on Monda. \u201cThe only way to end ongoing discussions over the referendum\u2019s legitimacy is to annul it. What is necessary is the annulment of this referendum. \u201d Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the CHP, also condemned the move to validate ballots after they are counted. \u201cYou cannot change the laws of the game during the match,\u201d he argued. \u201cThe electoral body has made the referendum\u2019s legitimacy disputed. \u201d Hurriyet cites CHP leaders who say they are building a case, including video of suspicious activity at voting stations, to bring to both the YSK and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The Democratic People\u2019s Party (HDP) a   leftist party, will also contest the results. \u201cThere were ballot papers without stamps on their backs. This shows no commitment to the laws of the election process,\u201d HDP spokesperson Osman Baydemir protested, estimating that more than 600 ballot boxes that the YSK ended up counting were \u201cillegal\u201d because of their improper lack of stamping. The stridently   HDP entered the referendum vote at a greater disadvantage than any other party. After the Turkish Parliament elected to strip HDP members of legislative immunity, police arrested the party\u2019s   Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f and Selahattin Demirta\u015f, on charges of \u201caiding terrorism\u201d by allegedly supporting Kurdish separatist groups. Another dozen HDP members were arrested in November along with Y\u00fcksekda\u011f and Demirta\u015f. The Organization for Security and   in Europe (OSCE) which sent international observers to follow the election, has already condemned the vote as illegitimate. \u201cWe observed the misuse of state resources, as well as the obstruction of \u2018no\u2019 campaign events. The campaign rhetoric was tarnished by some senior officials equating \u2018no\u2019 supporters with terrorist sympathizers,\u201d Tana de Zulueta, who observed the election on the group\u2019s behalf, said. Cezar Florin Preda, another observer, argued the referendum \u201ctook place on an unlevel playing field and the two sides of the campaign did not have equal opportunities. \u201d Even before Sunday\u2019s election, Erdogan had reportedly condemned the OSCE for meddling in Turkish affairs. \u201cThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe says if the result is \u2018yes,\u2019 that means there are a lot of problems. Who are you?\u201d Erdogan asked on Saturday, according to Iran\u2019s   PressTV. \u201cFirst of all, you should know your place. This is not your duty. \u201d Official Turkish government numbers showed Erdogan\u2019s push for a presidential system won by 51. 4 percent of the vote, with an estimated 48. 6 percent of the country voting \u201cno. \u201d Electoral maps showed Erdogan winning big in the nation\u2019s heartland and suburban areas, but the \u201cno\u201d vote sweeping the big cities  \u2014   Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir  \u2014   and the largely Kurdish Southeast. Following his victory, Erdogan delivered a speech praising the country: \u201cFor the first time in the republic\u2019s history, Turkey changed its governmental system through civilian means. \u201d He added that efforts to \u201cbelittle\u201d the election results would \u201cbe in vain. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561908.0995939}
