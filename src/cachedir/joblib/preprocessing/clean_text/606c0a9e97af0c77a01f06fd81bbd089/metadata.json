Now that we\u2019ve gotten what we wanted, it\u2019s time to describe exactly how a Trump presidency will improve our standing.\\nIf the President can say it then you can say it \\nThe biggest effect we\u2019ll see is the death of political correctness. We now have a shitlord for President who has insulted ugly women as \u201cfat pigs,\u201d and whose private macho talk, which all masculine men have done, was relentlessly attacked by the press but not punished in the voter booth. This means that when you talk like Trump, the first thought your listener will have is, \u201cHe sounds like the President of the United States.\u201d\\nWhat excuse will they now have for limiting your speech if one man was able to gain the highest office in the land because of it? Either Trump was elected because voters liked a person who makes those kinds of statements or they didn\u2019t care enough that he made them. Whichever explanation you accept means that the will of the American people has stated that you can exercise your free speech, your opinions, and your desire to flirt with attractive women without having to obey a speech police force that evaluates everything you do based on how offensive it is to a kaleidoscope of races and loony identities. You can begin removing your politically correct filter.\\nI\u2019m in a state of exuberance that we now have a President who rates women on a 1-10 scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude. We may have to institute a new feature called \u201cWould Trump bang?\u201d to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity. Simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer, and not the \u201cbeauty at every size\u201d sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes . The President of the United States does not see the value in fat women who don\u2019t take care of themselves, and neither should you.\\nLiberals will be forced to tolerate us in a way they didn\u2019t have to before \\nThere are so many of us that we can ease out of the closet and not be afraid of persecution like before. What are they going to do, fire everyone who supports Trump? Accuse every man who voted for him of rape? The way the establishment has been able to marginalize us is to corner men individually and apply intense pressure, but now we have natural allies in all men who back Trump, even if they don\u2019t subscribe to our particular interpretation of masculinity .\\nLiberals will not be able to point and shriek to get you to withdraw like before. They will not have easy victories by using labels like \u201cracist\u201d or \u201csexist.\u201d They will have to endure us in their midst and bite their lip when we offend their degenerate ideals, knowing that the price of attacking us is becoming too costly. It may be as simple as whipping out your MAGA hat, as if it\u2019s a bat signal, and having fellow Trump supporters come to your aid. I know that if I see a Trump supporter in trouble, I will help him, regardless of his race or station. Liberals will be forced to share space with those whom they hate, instead of trying to exile them like in the past.\\nIt will be easier to find a fellow traveler \\nMen who hold our beliefs have long ago learned that we can\u2019t go around sharing them in public to those who are not vetted. If you\u2019re like me, you first \u201ctest\u201d a new man you meet with a masculine comment to see how he responds, such as remarking on the attractiveness of a woman or how you\u2019ve heard of a community online that trolls liberals without mercy. We\u2019ve even had to devise a special \u201cpet shop\u201d code to know if a man is aware of the teachings that are found on ROK or the forum . We now have a easier shortcut in Trump.\\nIf a man tells you that he voted for Trump, it\u2019s safe to say that he is favorable to strong borders, nationalism , masculinity, and beautiful women. On a basic level, you will be able to get along with this man and build a bond. It also works the other way around where you bring up Trump to screen out those who are offended by him. It\u2019s fine if someone is politically indifferent, but if a man opposes Trump then I have to anticipate him attacking or sabotaging me in the future. I will distance myself from him for my own well-being.\\nThe cultural decline will halt \\nWe now have a President who will not encourage anti-male propaganda, rape culture, and female victimhood. While I do have minor concerns on the influence of his feminist-minded daughter, Ivanka, Trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of Obama. Because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense long-term manipulation, it is more than enough for Trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order. Stop feeding the rot and it will die off, allowing biology to naturally reassert itself.\\nWe\u2019ve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we haven\u2019t had a chance to understand what\u2019s going on and adapt. Instead, we\u2019ve been reacting from one blow to the next, whether it\u2019s the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration. Trump\u2019s victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harm\u2019s way.\\nConclusion Paradoxically, the benefits of a Trump presidency will not involve specific actions from Trump. His presence automatically legitimizes masculine behaviors that were previously labeled sexist and misogynist. While we may still get heat for them, it will be less severe and we\u2019ll be less likely to sustain serious damage. Liberals will have no choice but to silently stew on our words and we can more effortlessly connect with men not only for male bonding but also to push back against a demoralized and fractured left. Victories will be far easier to achieve under Trump than Obama.\\nThis is our moment. The door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men, and the best part of it is that we don\u2019t need to wait for Trump to do anything. His victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bull\u2019s horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors. It would be icing on the cake if Trump rolled back anti-masculine laws and policies, but it\u2019s not required, because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands. Return Of Kings opened in 2012, and the only surprise for me is how quickly the name is being fulfilled.\\nRead Next: If Donald Trump Doesn\u2019t Win, We\u2019re Screwed \\n'"}, "time": 1742563183.7120373}
