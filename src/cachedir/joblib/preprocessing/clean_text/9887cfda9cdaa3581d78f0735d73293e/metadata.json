T. \u2019s Media Lab, the digital futurist playground, David Rose is investigating swaddling, bedtime stories and hammocks, as well as lavender oil and cocoons. Mr. Rose, a researcher, an   and the author of \u201cEnchanted Objects: Design, Human Desire and the Internet of Things,\u201d and his colleagues have been   weighted blankets to induce a swaddling sensation and listening to recordings of Icelandic fairy tales  \u2014   all research into an ideal sleep environment that may culminate in a nap pod, or, as he said, \u201csome new furniture form. \u201d \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a swinging bed on a screened porch in northwestern Wisconsin,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can hear the loons and the wind through the fir trees, and there\u2019s the weight of 10 blankets on top of me because it\u2019s a cold night. We\u2019re trying a bunch of interventions. \u201d Meanwhile, at the University of California, Berkeley, Matthew P. Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology and the director of the Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory there, is working on direct current stimulation as a cure for sleeplessness in the aging brain. Dr. Walker is also sifting through the millions of hours of human sleep data he has received from Sense, a delicately lovely polycarbonate globe designed to look like the National Stadium in Beijing that measures air quality and other intangibles in your bedroom, then suggests tweaks to help you sleep better. \u201cI\u2019ve got a mission,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to reunite humanity with the sleep it is so bereft of. \u201d Sense is the first product made by Hello Inc. a technology company started by James Proud, a British entrepreneur, for which Dr. Walker is the chief scientist. In Paris, Hugo Mercier, a computer science engineer, has invested in sound waves. He has raised over $10 million to create a headband that uses them to induce sleep. The product, called Dreem, has been   on 500 people (out of a pool of 6, 500 applicants, Mr. Mercier said) and will be ready for sale this summer. That is when Ben Olsen, an Australian entrepreneur, hopes to introduce Thim, a gadget you wear on your finger that uses sound to startle you awake every three minutes for an hour, just before you go to sleep. Sleep disruptions, apparently, can cure sleep disruption (and Mr. Olsen, like all good sleep entrepreneurs, has the research to prove it). It is his second sleep contraption. His first, the   a pair of goggles fitted with tiny   lights that shine back into your eyes, aims to reset your body\u2019s clock. He said that since 2012, he had sold 30, 000 pairs in 40 countries. For years, studies upon studies have shown how bad sleep weakens the immune system, impairs learning and memory, contributes to depression and other mood and mental disorders, as well as obesity, diabetes, cancer and an early death. (Sedated sleep  \u2014   hello Ambien  \u2014   has been shown to be as deleterious as poor sleep.) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls sleeplessness a public health concern. Good sleep helps brain plasticity, studies in mice have shown poor sleep will make you fat and sad, and then will kill you. It is also expensive: Last year, the RAND Corporation published a study that calculated the business loss of poor sleep in the United States at $411 billion  \u2014   a gross domestic product loss of 2. 28 percent. Companies now fight \u201cpresenteeism,\u201d a neologism that describes the lackluster performance of     employees, with sleep programs like Sleepio, an online sleep coach, and sleep fairs, like the one hosted last month in Manhattan by Nancy H. Rothstein, director of Circadian Corporate Sleep Programs and otherwise known as the Sleep Ambassador, for LinkedIn. For the last few years, Ms. Rothstein has been designing sleep education and training programs for a number of Fortune 500 companies. At the LinkedIn sleep fair, she taught attendees how to make a bed (use hospital corners, please) and gave out analog alarm clocks. (It was her former husband\u2019s snoring, she said, that led her to a career as a sleep evangelist.) If sleep used to be the new sex, as Marian Salzman, a trend spotter and chief executive of Havas PR North America, proclaimed 10 years ago, today it is a measure of success  \u2014   a skill to be cultivated and nourished  \u2014   as a \u201chuman potential enhancer,\u201d as one West Coast entrepreneur told me, and life extender. \u201cSleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body,\u201d Dr. Walker of U. C. Berkeley said. \u201cWe have a saying in medicine: What gets measured, gets managed. \u201d Sleep entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and beyond have poured into the sleep space, as branders like to say  \u2014   a $32 billion market in 2012  \u2014   formerly inhabited by   mattress and pharmaceutical companies. \u201cI can see sleep being another weapon in competitive parenting and \u201d Ms. Salzman said. \u201cIf you want your child to succeed, do you have to buy them these sleep devices? Sleep is personal, it\u2019s class, not mass, and now the sleep industry is based on technical services, customized for me. It\u2019s a bizarre marriage of high tech and low tech. Chamomile tea is going to have a resurgence, as the antithesis to the whole pharma thing. \u201d The familiar paradigm of success used to center on the narrative of the short sleeper: Corporate titans and world leaders  \u2014   like Martha Stewart and our last two presidents  \u2014   counted abbreviated rest as proof of their prowess. It turns out that short sleepers, as they are known, may have a genetic mutation, as Arianna Huffington pointed out in her 2016 book, \u201cThe Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life One Night at a Time. \u201d (It\u2019s worth noting that George W. Bush, formerly a sleep outlier among his presidential peers for clocking in around nine hours of nightly   along with a daily nap, is newly popular.) The Army has proclaimed sleep a pillar of peak soldier performance. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, who used to take a sleeping bag to work when he was a lowly computer programmer, has said that his eight hours of sleep each night were good for his stockholders. Ms. Huffington\u2019s new company, Thrive Global, whose   investors include the internet entrepreneur Sean Parker and the venture capital firm Greycroft Partners, is working with Accenture, JP Morgan Chase and Uber, among other companies, on antiburnout programming, which educates their employees on the importance of sleep. Aetna, the health care company, is paying its workers up to $500 a year if they can prove they have slept for seven hours or more for 20 days in a row. But the growing pile of apps, gizmos and gurus  \u2014   some from unlikely corners  \u2014   has led to \u201cpandemonium in the bedroom,\u201d Ms. Rothstein said. In 2015, the actor Jeff Bridges made a   album, \u201cDreaming With Jeff,\u201d a project for Squarespace, that reached No. 2 on Billboard\u2019s New Age chart and raised $280, 000 for the No Kid Hungry campaign, for which he is the national spokesman. He collaborated with Keefus Ciancia, the composer and music producer, on a truly weird collection of   stories, musings about death and also a humming song, with Mr. Bridges\u2019s familiar gruff voice and all manner of ambient sounds that many listeners found more alarming than  . \u201cI don\u2019t know where this is leading,\u201d Mr. Bridges said the other day, \u201cbut I\u2019m steeping myself in the subject. We\u2019re working on something called Sleep Club, which will be sort of a hub for all things sleep related. \u201d \u201cDreaming With Jeff\u201d made me anxious, as did \u201cSleep With Me,\u201d a podcast by Drew Ackerman, a gravelly voiced librarian in San Francisco, whose \u201cboring bedtime stories\u201d are designed to cure insomnia and are downloaded at a rate of 1. 3 million a month, as The New Yorker reported last year. I\u2019m more drawn to the thousands of \u201csongs\u201d in Spotify\u2019s Sleep Sound Library, particularly \u201cfull gutters\u201d and \u201coffice \u201d and I have a white noise machine. But recently, desperately, I craved a more substantial intervention, perhaps a cure for the 3 a. m. fretting that has plagued me for years. Mr. Mercier sent me his Dreem headset, a weighty crown of rubber and wire that he warned would be a tad uncomfortable. The finished product, about $400, he said, will be much lighter and slimmer. But it wasn\u2019t the heft of the thing that had me pulling it off each night. It skeeved me out that it was reading  \u2014   and interfering with  \u2014   my brain waves, a process I would rather not outsource. I was just as wary of the   goggles, $299, which make for a   selfie in a darkened room. My eye sockets glowed a deep fluorescent green, and terrified the cat. The Ghost Pillow, $85, has \u201c    technology\u201d designed to keep your head cool. It is wildly comfy, but when I read what it is made from, a polyurethane foam, I lost sleep. I bought a Good Night Light LED Sleep bulb, $28, which comes with its own \u201cpatented technology\u201d to support your body\u2019s melatonin production. I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s what happened, but since the bulb is too dim for my   eyes, I struggled to read my   sleep aid, a worn copy of \u201cThe Pursuit of Love,\u201d by Nancy Mitford, and knocked off a good   earlier than usual. I was up again at 3 a. m. however, as my new Sense pod alerted me the next day, through an app on my phone. And again at 5 a. m. when the cat swatted the pod off the night stand and it glowed red in protest. \u201cThere was a noise disturbance,\u201d the app explained. My   sleep summary, as provided by Sense, was both compelling and  . Why is my air quality \u201cnot ideal\u201d? And how comfortable am I sharing my sleep habits with a Silicon Valley  ? Ms. Rothstein, the sleep ambassador, is less bothered by privacy concerns than by the temptation to wakefulness that phone interfaces pose. And nearly every gizmo seemed to have one. \u201cI\u2019d like to have a survey done to show how many people are also reading their texts while they\u2019re tracking their sleep,\u201d Ms. Rothstein said. \u201cIf you want to improve your sleep, you have to make some changes. Your Fitbit and your Apple Watch are not going to do it for you. We\u2019ve lost the simplicity of sleep. All this writing, all these websites, all this stuff. I\u2019m thinking, Just sleep. I want to say: \u2018Shh. Make it dark, quiet and cool. Take a bath. \u2019\u201d Ms. Rothstein taught me her relaxation recipe, a practice that mixed gratitude with body awareness and breathing. Start with your toes, she said, and thank your body parts for their hard work. (My favorite: \u201cKnees, I know it\u2019s not always easy for you. You can rest now. \u201d) Still, the best sleep I\u2019ve had in weeks cost $22, and lasted 33 minutes. It was a Deep Rest \u201cclass\u201d at Inscape, a meditation studio in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan designed by Winka Dubbeldam, the   Dutch architect, to evoke the temple at Burning Man, and other esoteric spaces, and created by Khajak Keledjian, a founder, with his brother, Haro, of Intermix, which they sold to the Gap for $130 million in 2013. Mr. Keledjian, a meditator, aims to make the practice both secular and modern: a \u201cmindful luxury,\u201d he said. Though there are human \u201cfacilitators\u201d in each class, who gently touch the feet of snoring attendees if they get too loud, the practice is guided by a recording made by an Australian female member of Mr. Keledjian\u2019s company. \u201cWe call her \u2018Skye,\u2019\u201d he said. It was lunchtime on a rainy Tuesday, and I settled onto a soft mat outfitted with a bolster, a pillow and a cozy fleece blanket. \u201cSkye\u201d urged me to stay awake, and then delivered a script like Ms. Rothstein\u2019s, in mellifluous antipodean tones. I drifted once or twice, and from the muffled snorts of the other attendees, they did too. That night, I slept until dawn.'"}, "time": 1742561869.0806932}
