[Infant \u201cpluripotent\u201d cells  \u2014   that is, those that have the potential to develop into any adult cell  \u2014   were placed inside pig embryos and successfully combined into an embryonic hybrid. Once that was accomplished, scientists from the Salk Institute implanted the experiment into the womb of a mature sow and observed the embryo\u2019s maturation over the course of a month.  Lead Researcher Izpisua Belmonte wanted to \u201cknow whether human cells can contribute at all to address the \u2018yes or no\u2019 question,\u201d regarding the potential for growing human organs from pigs. She\u2019s concluded that the study was \u201clong enough for us to try to understand how the human and pig cells mix together early on without raising ethical concerns about mature chimeric animals. \u201d Despite the success of the experiment, the resulting cells were very weak. Still, it was an \u201cimportant first step\u201d that brings Belmonte and his peers closer to the \u201cultimate goal\u201d to \u201cgrow functional and transplantable tissue or organs. \u201d And while he believes \u201cwe are still far away from that,\u201d they do have a lead: \u201cNow that we know the answer is yes, our next challenge is to improve efficiency and guide the human cells into forming a particular organ in pigs. \u201d To do so, they will need to edit the pig genome itself, to make it a better host for the development of human cellular structures. Pigs are already our best candidates for such work  \u2014   their organs are extremely similar to our own. With a lack of human donors on the proverbial table, the research could provide our best hope yet for manufacturing human organs for transplant. It might be the only way to save the   people who die every day waiting for an organ transplant. There are, of course, a multitude of ethical concerns in the creation of   hybrids. The Salk Institute has been forced to rely on private donations to fund the experiment, because such experiments remain ineligible for government funding. All told, the research has created 186 surviving chimeric embryos, each with about 1 in 100, 000 human cells. The human cells also seemed to slow the overall growth rate. University of North Carolina stem cell expert Ke Cheng says that the overwhelming predominance of pig tissue would very likely cause human bodies to resist the creations in their current form. And while there are \u201cother steps to take,\u201d he\u2019s called the development \u201cvery intriguing. \u201d This isn\u2019t the first experiment, nor will it be the last. Recently, human glial brain cells were implanted in mice. The mice solved mazes and memory tests twice as fast as their unmodified competitors. It\u2019s a new scientific frontier, with as many hard questions  \u2014   both moral and methodological  \u2014   as it has potential answers.
