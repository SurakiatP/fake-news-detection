With international elites and their institutions facing populist criticism amid political and social change in the United States and Europe, the 24 directors of the fund decided that this was not the time to leave the I. M. F. rudderless. Earlier on Monday, the Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique, a French court that considers cases against current and former government ministers, found Ms. Lagarde guilty of criminal charges linked to the misuse of public funds when she was France\u2019s finance minister nearly a decade ago. But the court did not impose a fine or a sentence. In a statement, the directors of the I. M. F. said they had considered the court\u2019s decisions and had \u201cfull confidence in the managing director\u2019s ability to continue to effectively carry out her duties. \u201d Yet the verdict  \u2014   with its potential to tarnish Ms. Lagarde as a leader  \u2014   came at a critical juncture for the I. M. F. Founded and largely managed by Europeans and Americans, the fund oversees a global economy in which   countries like China are seeking a greater role. Ms. Lagarde is the fourth of the last six leaders to come from France, and the difficult time the I. M. F. has had in anticipating, as well as reacting to, the European debt crisis has caused some to wonder whether the time has come to appoint a   leader. I. M. F. doctrine, which advocates free trade and austerity for countries in financial difficulties, has been criticized as elitist and not sufficiently in tune with the populist movements sweeping the globe. For now, the fund must confront more immediate challenges. With Britain leaving the European Union, Italy\u2019s future in the eurozone perhaps in doubt and the possibility of global trade wars being set off by   Donald J. Trump, some have said the steady, experienced hand of Ms. Lagarde was needed more than ever. \u201cShe has been a very effective leader,\u201d said Edwin M. Truman, a specialist in international finance formerly at the Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury. \u201cYes, there are big questions about the fund\u2019s future. But for her to have to step down now  \u2014   well, that would be complicated. \u201d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, expressed the Obama administration\u2019s support for Ms. Lagarde, saying that \u201cshe is a strong leader of the I. M. F. and we have every confidence in her ability to guide the fund at a critical time for the global economy. \u201d For the Trump administration, \u201cI don\u2019t think this kind of ethical question is likely to be the highest priority,\u201d Mr. Truman said. While the I. M. F. and other global institutions did not figure in the presidential debate, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized a \u201cglobal power structure\u201d that fixed the economy against workers. \u201cAt bottom, it\u2019s all about French politics,\u201d Mr. Truman said. Members of the I. M. F. board were well aware that Ms. Lagarde was facing trial in her native France over allegations that occurred when she was the finance minister in the administration of Nicolas Sarkozy. The consensus among the directors was that Ms. Lagarde\u2019s transgressions occurred when she was not at the fund  \u2014   in contrast to those of her predecessor, Dominique    \u2014   and since taking charge in 2011, she had proved to be a leader capable of presenting a softer side of the fund while fighting hard to bolster its legitimacy in the aftermath of the financial crisis. More so than her predecessors, Ms. Lagarde has pushed the fund to be more aggressive in taking up the cause of women and focusing attention on growing issues of inequality around the world. Over the last year and a half, she has also led a forceful public critique of Europe\u2019s refusal to offer Greece debt relief in return for the difficult economic changes the country has been making. Nevertheless, while Ms. Lagarde may have retained the backing of her board for the moment, over the longer term, her French legal problems may have hurt her most valuable asset  \u2014   her carefully constructed public persona. \u201cShe was a breath of fresh air, someone representing true change from the past,\u201d said Peter Doyle, a former economist at the fund and now an outspoken critic. \u201cNow she is just another tainted European leader. \u201d Those are tough words. But economists note that the fund\u2019s core mission of requiring financially ailing countries to reform their economies and fight corruption demands credibility and reputation of the highest order. And that starts at the top, with its leader  \u2014   especially one who is as widely known as Ms. Lagarde. \u201cIt would be complacent if not delusional to say there will be no impact on the institution,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a specialist on international economics at the Bruegel Institute in Brussels. \u201cThe only question is how big is the impact  \u2014   and how does it compare with the need for stability. \u201d Ms. Lagarde\u2019s legal issues in France have dogged her work at the fund since she was appointed in 2011. She took over as managing director after Mr.   resigned following accusations that he sexually assaulted a maid in a New York City hotel. The case against Ms. Lagarde centered on Bernard Tapie, a former entertainer and owner of Adidas who had previously been jailed on corruption charges. Mr. Tapie accused the lender Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, in which the French state had a stake at the time, of cheating him when it oversaw the sale of his share in the sportswear empire in 1993. Years of costly legal battles ensued. In 2007, Ms. Lagarde sent the dispute to a   private arbitration authority that awarded Mr. Tapie more than 400 million euros, or $420 million at current exchange rates, in damages and interest, to be paid by the state. The court did not fault Ms. Lagarde for approving the arbitration, but it ruled that she had been negligent for not appealing the decision. The court, noting that a judge had previously invalidated the payout in a 2015 ruling and that she had \u201cnational and international\u201d stature, decided not to punish Ms. Lagarde and spared her a criminal record. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Ms. Lagarde\u2019s lawyer, Patrick Maisonneuve, said he had a \u201cmixed\u201d reaction to the verdict. \u201cOn the one hand, she is found responsible, but given the circumstances, given the responsibilities that Ms. Lagarde had at the time  \u2014   in 2008, we were in a major economic crisis  \u2014   the court decided that it would not sentence Ms. Lagarde to anything,\u201d he said. Ms. Lagarde\u2019s lawyers can appeal the verdict before France\u2019s highest criminal court, the Cour de Cassation, on procedural grounds. But Mr. Maisonneuve suggested she might not, because no punishment was meted out. Ms. Lagarde did not attend the latest hearing on Monday, but was in Paris last week for the case.'"}, "time": 1742561843.6557028}
