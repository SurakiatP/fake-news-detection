[Senator Ron Johnson ( ) told reporters, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that premiums on the individual market should double and triple in a state like mine. There was no reason for that other than Obamacare. We need to diagnose that, then figure out what policies we can agree on to bring those premiums down. \u201d  Republican Senators aim to lower premiums, although the Senate health working group remains divided on how to reduce health costs. Some floated the idea of giving states waivers to Obamacare\u2019s essential health benefits, in a similar fashion to the House\u2019s American Health Care Act (AHCA) while others want to   Americans without health insurance into catastrophic health insurance plans. Johnson told reporters that regulations \u201cabsolutely\u201d need to be addressed. When asked whether he would protect   conditions, he said, \u201cI\u2019m guaranteeing nothing other than my effort to try and bring those premiums down. \u201d Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander supports giving states more authority to regulate insurance. He said, \u201cWe would like to move more decisions out of Washington, back to the states, about regulating insurance. \u201d Senator Bob Corker ( ) echoed Sen. Alexander\u2019s statement, saying, \u201cI have to believe that when you mandate ten essential health benefits in a rigid way that it affects the cost of premiums. \u201d Corker added that any reform must also include protections for   conditions. Sen. Bill Cassidy ( ) leads another camp that wants to   Americans without health insurance into a basic, catastrophic health care plan, paid for by an individual\u2019s federal tax credit. Cassidy\u2019s camp argues that this would force more healthy people into the Obamacare exchanges to balance out the costs of sick and older Americans. The Louisiana senator explained, \u201cYour best way to lower premiums is to expand the risk pool   \u2026       would allow expansion of the risk pools. \u201d A senior GOP aide said that   is \u201cabsolutely\u201d the solution to lowering premiums. The aide said that Senator John Cornyn ( ) spoke about   at the Senate health working group and it was \u201cwell received. \u201d Another senior GOP aide alleged that   is \u201cis one of many ideas being examined for their utility and impact   \u2026     There\u2019s no leading options yet lots for members to explore and implications to assess before any decisions will be made. \u201d   Americans in catastrophic health insurance has been floated by conservatives before. Sen. Bill Cassidy and Rep. Pete Sessions ( ) sponsored a bill that would enable   in health care. The American Enterprise Institute released a white paper that advocates   for health care plans to ensure universal health insurance for all Americans. Senate staffers think that   Americans would serve as a better incentive than an individual mandate, or the 30 percent insurance premium for those who forgo health insurance in the American Health Care Act. One senior GOP aide said that \u201cIHeat\u2019s not viewed as a harmful mandate, because there\u2019s no consequence. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561958.2227232}
