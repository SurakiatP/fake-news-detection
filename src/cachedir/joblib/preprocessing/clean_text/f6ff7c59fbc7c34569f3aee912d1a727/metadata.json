That\u2019s where we started six months ago. We have now heard from six of the eight Democrats on this committee, and, to my knowledge, I don\u2019t think a single one of them asked that question. They\u2019ve gone down lots of other rabbit trails, but not that question. Maybe that is because Jim oCmey said last week, as he said to Donald Trump, that on three times he assured him he was not under investigation. Maybe it\u2019s because multiple Democrats on this committee have stated they have seen no evidence thusfar, after six months of our investigation and ten  \u2014   11 months of an FBI investigation of any such collusion. I would just suggest, what do we think happened at the Mayflower? Mr. Sessions, are you familiar with what spies called tradecraft?\u201d After Sessions responded, \u201cA little bit. \u201d Cotton continued, \u201cThat involves things like covert communications and dead drops and brush passes, right?\u201d Sessions answered that\u2019s \u201cpart of it. \u201d Cotton then asked Sessions if he liked spy fiction. After Sessions answered in the affirmative, Cotton asked, \u201cHave you ever, in any of these fantastical situations, heard of a plot line so ridiculous that a sitting United States senator and an ambassador of a foreign government colluded at an open setting with hundreds of other people to pull off the greatest caper in the history of espionage?\u201d Sessions answered that such charges are \u201cbeyond my capability to understand. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561804.050563}
