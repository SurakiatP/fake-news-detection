Dear Watchers, The Emmys are Sunday, and we\u2019ll have plenty of coverage coming up this weekend, but for now, let\u2019s take one last look at the summer that was. Today\u2019s newsletter rounds up the worthy shows that came out in the last few months, some of which you might have missed, and some of which you might have added to ye olde DVR but have not gotten to. Happy watching. \u201cO. J.: Made in America\u201d is maybe Watching\u2019s most mentioned TV specimen so far, and with good reason: It\u2019s one of the best   in living memory. ESPN\u2019s   documentary is gripping and educational and made what I thought was a familiar story into something completely new and riveting. If you don\u2019t want to commit, at least watch the first episode, which alone is one of the best documentaries about race in Los Angeles you are likely ever to see. (Watch on ESPN.) Neflix\u2019s \u201cStranger Things\u201d has captured the internet\u2019s imagination to a degree that surpasses understanding. It\u2019s pretty good, and I enjoyed it tremendously, but I have no idea how it became such a thing. Aspirational nostalgia from people too young to actually remember 1983? Maybe! \u201cStranger\u201d is radically straightforward for a horror story: It isn\u2019t trying to trick you, and it isn\u2019t trying to wink at you. (I didn\u2019t find it all that scary, but I am in the minority.) (Watch on Netflix.) \u201cThe Great British Baking Show\u201d makes its way to PBS on a seemingly arbitrary schedule, but if one has to endure frustrating broadcast delays in order to encounter the most charming food show currently airing, well, that\u2019s just the way the cookie crumbles.   but brutally exacting, the series pulls off a feat almost unheard of on reality contest shows: There\u2019s zero     drama. The entire story of every episode revolves solely around baking triumphs and failures. Let this show inspire you to live every day as if you were a \u201cstar baker. \u201d (Watch on PBS and Netflix.) Sometimes great shows don\u2019t capture \u201cthe conversation. \u201d Boo. These shows are fantastic give \u2018em a go if you haven\u2019t already. The megachurch ensemble drama \u201cGreenleaf\u201d premiered as OWN\u2019s biggest show ever, and yet it didn\u2019t seem to be particularly buzzy. While its network mate \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d is destined for more acclaim, \u201cGreenleaf\u201d deserves plenty of attention, too. It\u2019s vibrant and smart, and not afraid of soapier moments. (Watch on the OWN app.) If you miss \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d  \u2014   don\u2019t we all?  \u2014   watch Netflix\u2019s \u201cLast Chance U,\u201d a   documentary series about a community college football team that sends most of its players on to Division I programs. After you watch it, please tweet me your thoughts, because I want to talk about this show so much. (Watch on Netflix.) For anyone who likes medical shows, \u201cBoston EMS\u201d is an absorbing spin. It\u2019s a documentary series that never crosses the threshold of a hospital the show only takes place on the road and in the ambulances. Rare is the series that can make you care so much so quickly. (Watch on ABC.) \u201cTake My Wife,\u201d on NBC\u2019s comedy streaming service Seeso, is a quick six episodes, but they charmed me so much I watched them twice.   and wives Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher star as loosely themselves, and the show covers the ins and outs of the Los Angeles comedy scene without being tragic or sleazy. There are a ton of shows right now where comedians play themselves, but \u201cWife\u201d is the only one pulling off     exploring the idea that the more you\u2019re yourself in your life, the better your comedy becomes. (Watch on Seeso for Amazon.) Some people loved them! Some people didn\u2019t care at all! Which one are you? I don\u2019t know! You are the captain of your own vessels. I can only offer guidance. CBS\u2019s twisted political black comedy \u201cBrainDead,\u201d from the creators of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d was a tough sell. Alien ants crawl into politicos\u2019 ears, turn them extra partisan, and sometimes heads literally explode. I didn\u2019t always grasp the rules that governed the alien invasion, but both Mary Elizabeth Winstead\u2019s sparkling performance and Jonathan Coulton\u2019s silly songs that served as the \u201cpreviously on\u201d segments delighted me. (Watch on Amazon.) If \u201cStranger Things\u201d hadn\u2019t come out this summer, would \u201cThe Get Down\u201d have been Netflix\u2019s big show? It\u2019s someone\u2019s job to know the answer to that, but not mine. Baz Luhrmann\u2019s   origin story, set in the Bronx in the 1970s, has a messy pilot but pulls itself together in subsequent episodes. I didn\u2019t have the real estate for another sprawling show, but maybe you do. (Watch on Netflix.) If you want to watch two attractive actors in attractive locations learn about attractive beverages, then yeah, \u201cThe Wine Show\u201d is for you. But maybe you are just a salty crab crabbing around, and you want educational shows to be more substantive, cohesive and convincing. A toast to however you are. (Watch on Hulu.) If you thought those hidden gems above were hidden, well   \u2026     these were even more hidden. \u201cStill the King\u201d is a Billy Ray Cyrus vehicle on CMT where he plays a   singer pretending to be a minister back in his rural hometown. I know, I know. But it\u2019s reminiscent of \u201cMy Name Is Earl\u201d in all the good ways, and it\u2019s an undercover sweetheart of a show. (Watch on CMT.) On the drama front, TNT\u2019s \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d really aimed for a \u201cDiet \u2018Sons Of Anarchy\u2019\u201d vibe and mostly hit it  \u2014   it\u2019s physically and emotionally violent, bordering on grotesque. Ellen Barkin stars as the matriarch of a California crime family, where\u201a if you can believe it, there is not honor among thieves. (Watch on TNT Drama.) I didn\u2019t love \u201cQueen of the South,\u201d USA\u2019s drug queenpin drama adapted from a popular book and Telemundo telenovela, but I might give it another try knowing that Season 2 will have a different showrunner. But if you have an insatiable appetite for stories of violent drug trafficking, theoretically you could do worse. (Watch on USA.) Indeed. Lots of good stuff, actually. If you like   family dramas that still have potent dialogue, try the British series\u201cThe A Word,\u201d about a family whose    son is autistic. It\u2019s the right amount of emotional without being wrenching  \u2014   it\u2019s not a show that wrecks you, but you might want to drink tea and wear sweaters for a while after watching it. (Watch on Sundance.) Satisfying though never surprising, Australia\u2019s \u201cCleverman\u201d uses Aboriginal mythology in its superhero storytelling. It\u2019s reminiscent of \u201cDistrict 9\u201d and \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d but a bit sloppier and less horrific. (Watch on Netflix.) For many viewers, the only thing better than a British murder show is a Scandinavian murder show. \u201cThe Tunnel\u201d is somewhere in between as a British adaptation of a Scandinavian series. If you\u2019ve watched the original \u201c\u201d or the American adaptation \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d this   serial killer mystery will seem redundant, but if not, there are thrills aplenty. (Watch on PBS.) There are plenty of   shows, but \u201cThirteen\u201d is the rare   show: Ivy is a    woman who was kidnapped 13 years ago and has now returned. It\u2019s creepy and haunting, and luckily moves very quickly. Is England half murderers? Maybe! (Watch on BBC America.) Amazon\u2019s two most promising pilots this   are Jill Soloway\u2019s \u201cI Love Dick\u201d and the reboot of \u201cThe Tick. \u201d Could Amazon market this in a package called \u201cDick and the Tick\u201d? They could but shouldn\u2019t. \u201cDick\u201d stars Kathryn Hahn as a frustrated filmmaker who develops an obsession with a mysterious academic (Kevin Bacon). And \u201cThe Tick\u201d is an effective entry in the very saturated superhero genre, satirical but thoughtful and textured. On Sept. 17, \u201cGimme the Loot\u201d will expire from Netflix. In this wonderful \u201csummer in the city\u201d movie, Malcolm (Ty Hickson) and Sofia (Tashiana Washington) are burgeoning graffiti artists struggling to gain respect. So they hatch a plan to boost their reputation: tag a New York City icon so that no one will forget them. But it\u2019s the   realistic friendship between Malcolm and Sofia that makes \u201cGimme the Loot\u201d memorable. (Watch on Netflix watch the trailer and add the film to your watchlist here.)  \u2014   Monica Castillo \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d returns for its sixth season on Wednesday. At this point, you probably know if you like \u201cA. H. S. \u201d or not. Unlike previous years, FX hasn\u2019t announced the premise or setting for the season, nor have they sent episodes to critics. Enter at your own risk.'"}, "time": 1742563806.9651654}
