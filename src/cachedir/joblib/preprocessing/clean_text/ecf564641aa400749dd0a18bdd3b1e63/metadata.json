What they don\u2019t realize is that there simply is not a solution under the current U.S. financial system. It is now mathematically impossible for the U.S. government to pay off the U.S. national debt. You see, the truth is that the U.S. government now owes more dollars than actually exist. If the U.S. government went out today and took every single penny from every single American bank, business and taxpayer, they still would not be able to pay off the national debt. And if they did that, obviously American society would stop functioning because nobody would have any money to buy or sell anything. \\nAnd the U.S. government would still be massively in debt. \\nSo why doesn\u2019t the U.S. government just fire up the printing presses and print a bunch of money to pay off the debt? \\nWell, for one very simple reason. \\nThat is not the way our system works. \\nYou see, for more dollars to enter the system, the U.S. government has to go into more debt. \\nThe U.S. government does not issue U.S. currency \u2013 the Federal Reserve does. \\nThe Federal Reserve is a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers. \\nIf you will pull a dollar bill out and take a look at it, you will notice that it says \u201cFederal Reserve Note\u201d at the top. \\nIt belongs to the Federal Reserve. \\nThe U.S. government cannot simply go out and create new money whenever it wants under our current system. \\nInstead, it must get it from the Federal Reserve. \\nSo, when the U.S. government needs to borrow more money (which happens a lot these days) it goes over to the Federal Reserve and asks them for some more green pieces of paper called Federal Reserve Notes. \\nThe Federal Reserve swaps these green pieces of paper for pink pieces of paper called U.S. Treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve either sells these U.S. Treasury bonds or they keep the bonds for themselves (which happens a lot these days). \\nSo that is how the U.S. government gets more green pieces of paper called \u201cU.S. dollars\u201d to put into circulation. But by doing so, they get themselves into even more debt which they will owe even more interest on. \\nSo every time the U.S. government does this, the national debt gets even bigger and the interest on that debt gets even bigger. \\nAre you starting to get the picture? \\nAs you read this, the U.S. national debt is approximately 12 trillion dollars, although it is going up so rapidly that it is really hard to pin down an exact figure. \\nSo how much money actually exists in the United States today? \\nWell, there are several ways to measure this. \\nThe \u201cM0\u2033 money supply is the total of all physical bills and currency, plus the money on hand in bank vaults and all of the deposits those banks have at reserve banks. As of mid-2009, the Federal Reserve said that this amount was about 908 billion dollars. \\nThe \u201cM1\u2033 money supply includes all of the currency in the \u201cM0\u2033 money supply, along with all of the money held in checking accounts and other checkable accounts at banks, as well as all money contained in travelers\u2019 checks. According to the Federal Reserve , this totaled approximately 1.7 trillion dollars in December 2009, but not all of this money actually \u201cexists\u201d as we will see in a moment. \\nThe \u201cM2\u2033 money supply includes everything in the \u201cM1\u2033 money supply plus most other savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small denomination time deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000). According to the Federal Reserve , this totaled approximately 8.5 trillion dollars in December 2009, but once again, not all of this money actually \u201cexists\u201d as we will see in a moment. \\nThe \u201cM3\u2033 money supply includes everything in the \u201cM2\u2033 money supply plus all other CDs (large time deposits and institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve does not keep track of M3 anymore, but according to ShadowStats.com it is currently somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 trillion dollars. But again, not all of this \u201cmoney\u201d actually \u201cexists\u201d either. \\nSo why doesn\u2019t it exist? \\nIt is because our financial system is based on something called fractional reserve banking. \\nWhen you go over to your local bank and deposit $100, they do not keep your $100 in the bank. Instead, they keep only a small fraction of your money there at the bank and they lend out the rest to someone else. Then, if that person deposits the money that was just borrowed at the same bank, that bank can loan out most of that money once again. In this way, the amount of \u201cmoney\u201d quickly gets multiplied. But in reality, only $100 actually exists. The system works because we do not all run down to the bank and demand all of our money at the same time. \\nAccording to the New York Federal Reserve Bank , fractional reserve banking can be explained this way\u2026. \\n\u201c If the reserve requirement is 10%, for example, a bank that receives a $100 deposit may lend out $90 of that deposit. If the borrower then writes a check to someone who deposits the $90, the bank receiving that deposit can lend out $81. As the process continues, the banking system can expand the initial deposit of $100 into a maximum of $1,000 of money ($100+$90+81+$72.90+\u2026=$1,000).\u201d \\nSo much of the \u201cmoney\u201d out there today is basically made up out of thin air. \\nIn fact, most banks have no reserve requirements at all on savings deposits, CDs and certain kinds of money market accounts. Primarily, reserve requirements apply only to \u201ctransactions deposits\u201d \u2013 essentially checking accounts. \\nThe truth is that banks are freer today to dramatically \u201cmultiply\u201d the amounts deposited with them than ever before. But all of this \u201cmultiplied\u201d money is only on paper \u2013 it doesn\u2019t actually exist. \\nThe point is that the broadest measures of the money supply (M2 and M3) vastly overstate how much \u201creal money\u201d actually exists in the system. \\nSo if the U.S. government went out today and demanded every single dollar from all banks, businesses and individuals in the United States it would not be able to collect 14 trillion dollars (M3) or even 8.5 trillion dollars (M2) because those amounts are based on fractional reserve banking. \\nSo the bottom line is this\u2026. \\n#1) If all money owned by all American banks, businesses and individuals was gathered up today and sent to the U.S. government, there would not be enough to pay off the U.S. national debt. \\n#2) The only way to create more money is to go into even more debt which makes the problem even worse. \\nYou see, this is what the whole Federal Reserve System was designed to do. It was designed to slowly drain the massive wealth of the American people and transfer it to the elite international bankers. \\nIt is a game that is designed so that the U.S. government cannot win. As soon as they create more money by borrowing it, the U.S. government owes more than what was created because of interest. \\nIf you owe more money than ever was created you can never pay it back. \\nThat means perpetual debt for as long as the system exists. \\nIt is a system designed to force the U.S. government into ever-increasing amounts of debt because there is no escape. \\nWe could solve this problem by shutting down the Federal Reserve and restoring the power to issue U.S. currency to the U.S. Congress (which is what the U.S. Constitution calls for). But the politicians in Washington D.C. are not about to do that. \\nSo unless you are willing to fundamentally change the current system, you might as well quit complaining about the U.S. national debt because it is now mathematically impossible to pay it off. \\n***UPDATE*** \\nIt has been suggested that the same dollar can be used to pay off debt over and over \u2013 this is theoretically true as long as the dollar remains in the system. \\nFor example, if the U.S. government gives China a dollar to pay off a debt, there is a good chance that the U.S. government will be able to acquire that dollar again and use it to pay off another debt. \\nHowever, this is not true when debt is retired with the Federal Reserve. In that case, money is actually removed from the system. In fact, because of the \u201cmoney multiplier\u201d, when debt is retired with the Federal Reserve it can remove ten times that amount of money (and actually more, but let\u2019s not get too technical) from the system. \\nYou see, fractional reserve banking works both ways. When $100 is introduced into the system, it can theoretically create $1000 as the example in the article above demonstrates. However, when that $100 is removed, it can have the opposite impact. \\nAnd considering the fact that the Federal Reserve \u201cpurchased\u201d the vast majority of new U.S. government debt last year , we have got a real mess on our hands. \\nEven if a way could be figured out how to pay off all the debt we owe to foreign nations (such as China, Japan, etc.) it would still be mathematically impossible to pay off the debt that we owe to the Federal Reserve which is exploding so fast that it is hard to even keep track of. \\nOf course we could repudiate that debt and shut down the Federal Reserve, but very few in Washington D.C. have any interest in doing that. \\nIt has also been suggested that instead of just using dollars to pay off the U.S. national debt, we could use the assets of the U.S. government to pay it off. \\nThat is rather extreme, but let us consider that for a moment. \\nThat total value of all physical assets in the United States, both publicly and privately owned, is somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 to 50 trillion dollars. Of course the idea of the U.S. government \u201cowning\u201d every single asset of the American people is repugnant to our entire way of life, but let\u2019s assume that for a moment. \\nAccording to the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government , which is an official United States government report, the total liabilities of the United States government, including future social security and medicare payments that the U.S. government is already committed to pay out, now exceed 65 TRILLION dollars. This amount is more than the entire GDP of the whole world. \\nIn fact, there are other authors who have written that the actual figure for the future liabilities of the U.S. government should be much higher, but let\u2019s be conservative and go with 65 trillion for now. \\nSo, if the U.S. government took control of all physical assets in the United States and sold them off, it could not even make enough money to pay for everything that the U.S. government is already on the hook for. \\nOuch. \\nIf you have not read the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government , you really should. Actually the 2009 report should be available very soon if it isn\u2019t already. If anyone knows if it is available, please let us know. \\nThe truth is that the U.S. government is in much bigger financial trouble than we have been led to believe. \\nFor example, according to the report (which remember is an official U.S. government report) the real U.S. budget deficit for 2008 was not 455 billion dollars. It was actually 5.1 trillion dollars. \\nSo why the difference? \\nThe CBO\u2019s 455 billion figure is based on cash accounting, while the 5.1 trillion figure in the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government is based on GAAP accounting. GAAP accounting is what is used by all the major firms on Wall Street and it is regarded as a much more accurate reflection of financial reality. \\nSo needless to say, the United States is in a financial mess of unprecedented magnitude. \\nSo what should we do? Does anyone have any suggestions? \\n***UPDATE 2*** \\nWe have received a lot of great comments on this article. Trying to understand the U.S. financial system (even after studying it for years) can be very difficult at times. In fact, it can almost seem like playing 3 dimensional chess. \\nSeveral readers have correctly pointed out that when the U.S. money supply is expanded by the Federal Reserve, the interest that is to be paid on that new debt is not created. \\nSo where does the money to pay that interest come from? Well, eventually the money supply has to be expanded some more. But that creates even more debt. \\nThat brings us to the next point. \\nSeveral readers have insisted that the Federal Reserve is not privately owned and that since it returns \u201cmost\u201d of the profits it makes to the U.S. government that we should not be concerned about the debt owed to it. \\nThe truth is that what you have with the Federal Reserve is layers of ownership. The following was originally posted on the Federal Reserve\u2019s website\u2026. \\n\u201cThe twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, which were established by Congress as the operating arms of the nation\u2019s central banking system, are organized much like private corporations \u2013 possibly leading to some confusion about \u201cownership.\u201d For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan; dividends are, by law, 6 percent per year.\u201d \\nSo Federal Reserve \u201cstock\u201d is owned by member banks. So who owns the member banks? Well, when you sift through additional layers of ownership, you will ultimately find that people like the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and the Queen of England have very large ownership interests in the big banks. But there are so many layers of ownership that they are able to disguise themselves well. \\nYou see, these people are not stupid. They did not become the richest people in the world by being morons. It was the banking elite of the world who designed the Federal Reserve and it is the banking elite of the world who benefit the most from the Federal Reserve today. In the article above when we described the Federal Reserve as \u201ca private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers\u201d we may have been oversimplifying things a bit, but it is the essence of what is going on. \\nIn an excellent article that she did on the Federal Reserve, Ellen Brown described a number of the ways that the Federal Reserve makes money for those who own it\u2026. \\nThe interest on bonds acquired with its newly-issued Federal Reserve Notes pays the Fed\u2019s operating expenses plus a guaranteed 6% return to its banker shareholders. A mere 6% a year may not be considered a profit in the world of Wall Street high finance, but most businesses that manage to cover all their expenses and give their shareholders a guaranteed 6% return are considered \u201cfor profit\u201d corporations. \\nIn addition to this guaranteed 6%, the banks will now be getting interest from the taxpayers on their \u201creserves.\u201d The basic reserve requirement set by the Federal Reserve is 10%. The website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York explains that as money is redeposited and relent throughout the banking system, this 10% held in \u201creserve\u201d can be fanned into ten times that sum in loans; that is, $10,000 in reserves becomes $100,000 in loans. Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.8 puts the total \u201cloans and leases in bank credit\u201d as of September 24, 2008 at $7,049 billion. Ten percent of that is $700 billion. That means we the taxpayers will be paying interest to the banks on at least $700 billion annually \u2013 this so that the banks can retain the reserves to accumulate interest on ten times that sum in loans. \\nThe banks earn these returns from the taxpayers for the privilege of having the banks\u2019 interests protected by an all-powerful independent private central bank, even when those interests may be opposed to the taxpayers\u2019 \u2014 for example, when the banks use their special status as private money creators to fund speculative derivative schemes that threaten to collapse the U.S. economy. Among other special benefits, banks and other financial institutions (but not other corporations) can borrow at the low Fed funds rate of about 2%. They can then turn around and put this money into 30-year Treasury bonds at 4.5%, earning an immediate 2.5% from the taxpayers, just by virtue of their position as favored banks. A long list of banks (but not other corporations) is also now protected from the short selling that can crash the price of other stocks. \\nThe reality is that there are a lot of ways that the Federal Reserve is a money-making tool. Yes, they do return \u201csome\u201d of their profits to the U.S. government each year. But the Federal Reserve is NOT a government agency and it DOES make profits. \\nSo just how much money is made over there? The truth is that we have to rely on what the Federal Reserve tells us, because they have never been subjected to a comprehensive audit by the U.S. government. \\nEver. \\nRight now there is legislation going through Congress that would change that, and the Federal Reserve is fighting it tooth and nail. They are warning that such an audit could cause a financial disaster. \\nWhat are they so afraid of? \\nAre they afraid that we might get to peek inside and see what they have been up to all these years? \\nIf you are a history buff, then you probably know that debates about a \u201ccentral bank\u201d go all the way back to the Founding Fathers. \\nThe European banking elite have always been determined to control our currency, and that is exactly what is happening today. \\nEver since the Federal Reserve was created, there have been members of the U.S. Congress that have been trying to warn the American people about the insidious nature of this institution. \\nJust check out what the Honorable Louis McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee had to say all the way back in the 1930s\u2026. \\n\u201cSome people think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions. They are private monopolies which prey upon the people of these United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers; and rich and predatory money lenders.\u201d \\nThe Federal Reserve is not the solution and it never has been. \\nThe Federal Reserve is the problem. \\nAny thoughts? OOPS! \u2013 U.S. Government Unemployment Numbers Have To Be Revised Because They Were Off By Almost One MILLION! \u00bb Bart \\nHas there ever been a time in history when money in circulation equalled or exceeded all credit/debt \u2013 I doubt it. As long as there is one person willing to extend credit to another you are going to have this imbalance. \\nThe big problem we just went through with the credit bubble was that the central banks lost control of the money supply. This led to a global credit bubble, which popped when there was a run on Lehman\u2019s bank because the credit markets froze (largely due to an inability to price risk). \\nA run on the bank is when people have a money preference and pull out all their cash. This used to result in liquidity crises like 1907 when the British demanded we pay all our debt in gold. Now, the FDIC pays out on bank runs or the Fed does. We just went through the largest liquidity crisis in history and the Fed handled by doubling the assets on their balance sheet they created trillions in reserves. More importantly this \u201cdebt\u201d that is the credit that was extended has 0% interest attached, so as the economy stabilizes the debt-service shoudl be pretty easy. \\nYou\u2019re right that in our system when we create money we create debt. I prefer direct money creation where Congress creates money to pay for infrastructure and that\u2019s how we expand the money supply. Blade \\nBart\u2026is your last name Simpson by any chance? If I have ten bucks and loan you five there is still ten bucks in circulation!! Hellooo! It is when I go to the printing press and print up another fiver like I just lent you and stick it in my pocket so I still have ten that is the problem!! \\nIn 1835, under President Andrew Jackson, the US Federal Budget was balanced and the National Debt was paid in full. This has never happened since. This fine man did not appreciate Rockefeller and his fellow printer schiesters!! Get some history knowledge Bart, then you might be smart enough to grow some backbone instead of sounding comically loony! Josh \\nWho exactly do we owe all this money to? Let them try and collect it. Worst case we stop spending trillions of the defense budget. Honestly people can\u2019t realize the whole monetary system is scam to turn as all into slaves and deny us much as possible so that New World Order can use all as much output as possible for their own designs. RIck M. \\nThe problem isn\u2019t the lending or borrowing. i.e. if I borrow a cup of sugar from my neighbor, they don\u2019t expect to have a 5-pound bag returned to them as payment. \\nYes, there WAS a time that money exceeded the debt, it was when the people worked to save for what they purchased, or loaned it without interest. The issue that makes the banking system so very flawed is that they loan money (or a percentage thereof) that was entrusted to them to others with the interest collected from all parties making use of the original individuals actual deposit. \\nWhile one could argue that this is a reasonable thing to do; which it was only slightly less corrupt in intention when there was REAL money, EG: Gold or silver, on hold; the fact that the depositors are now depositing federal reserve notes (which are counted at face value \u2013 already fractionally inflated) to be loaned using fractional accounting. THIS is what causes the so-called debt bubble. \\nThe process cannot go on indefinitely, just as any pyramid or ponzi scheme\u2026 sooner or later the whole thing falls apart because there aren\u2019t sufficient real funds to support the illusion. \\nThe author here is absolutely correct, there isn\u2019t enough \u201cmoney\u201d to repay the bankers, so the eventual collapse of the entire system is inevitable. Since the debt was incurred against treasury bonds, the only way to repay it now is with REAL PROPERTY since we don\u2019t have real reserves to back it. In essence \u2013 they will own everything as it becomes nationalized to cover the increasing debt. Catch-22 \\nUm, yeah, I agree that we ignored the Constitutional requirement BUT: If we now were to somehow close down the Fed, would you really want to turn over the power of money creation to the current congress? I cannot imagine letting the 535 economically-ignorant party hacks devise a sound replacement. I fear for our republic. ebeye \\nIt\u2019s ALWAYS been impossible to pay off the \u201cdebt\u201d! The interest has to be created, which is more debt! The only way to eliminate it is to repudiate the Federal Reserve and it\u2019s claim of debt upon the people, then revert to either a nationally derived currency, or simply allow any form of currency to be used. \\nhttp://www.ivamu.com/ Garynils \\nThe creature from Jeckyl Island has now officially sealed the fate of ALL future generations of Americans. The really scary thing about this financial meltdown is the historical precedent that has benn established. What is the favorite remedy that corrupt governments use when faced with economic collapse? That\u2019s right. War! Philippians 6-12. Russ L. Smith \\nSo they \u201cdoubled their balance sheet\u201d which means that everything lost 50% of it\u2019s value, or every dollar became 50 cents. That will make paying off the debt twice as hard. Don Robertson \\nYes, it is very alarming the sort of things mathematics can point out. But do not start throwing your money out the window for the wind to catch and take away. \\nThere is absolutely nothing in the Universe that can be described EXACTLY by mathematics. Why not? Because there are no two things anywhere in the Universe that are so perfectly alike, we can add them 1+1 and say \u201c2\u201d describes these things to every extent possible. \\nThe American dollar is still coveted by more people on this planet than any other currency. \\nNot one in a 100 people reading this post have ever seen a Yuan, a Euro, or even a Peso. Not one in a thousand has one in their pocket! \\nI live right on the Canadian border. The Canadians come over here to shop because milk is like $6.00 a gallon in Canada.

Truthteller \\nTurn the Fed into an actual department of the Federal Government or amalgamate it with the Treasury. Money can then be issued without interest having to be paid to a private bank. At one stroke, a large part of the current debt can be removed as the debt owing to the \u2018former Federal Reserve\u2019 would be cancelled. Or is this too simple an idea? Mr. Universe \\nIt is an excellent idea, i can just see a hole in it though, if we were to impliment this plan, whats to stop the government from collecting the debt from it\u2019s citzens??? just wondering very, very good plan though. \\nSimple solutions are often the ones that are the most overlooked \\nSincerely \\nhttp://home.iae.nl/users/lightnet/creator/nationaldebt.htm This Awareness indicates that you must understand that when the Federal Reserve bank, the privately owned Federal Reserve bank, was given authority to print Federal Reserve notes instead of the Treasury Department writing the Treasury Notes as directed by the U.S. Constitution, these Federal Reserve notes were not printed to be given out to the economy, in the way as the Treasury Notes of the Treasury Department. Rather, they were loaned to the U.S. government and then circulated into society, and society was required to pay back interest on the IRS notes and that amount of interest accumulated to the point of approximately 5 trillion dollars at this time (Revelations of Awareness newsletter issue no. 430 1994), to where, if everything in the United States were sold, half of the debt would still be owed. \\nThis Awareness indicates that the Treasury Department has the potential for totally denouncing the Federal Reserve debt of 5 trillion dollars because it was illegal in the first place. The Treasury Department in the U.S. Constitution is the only proper way of financing the nation; Congress, operating the Treasury Department has the right to mint and coin money, and set the value thereof. \\nThis Awareness indicates that in this fact, the Federal Reserve was never given any such a right, even with the vote of the Congress, because Congress did not have the right to relegate its obligations to the Federal Reserve, therefore the entire debt of five trillion dollars, because it was illegal in the fist place, is not forcible in a technical sense. MisterMoney \\nInflation is the plan! \\nThe debt can be repaid in cheaper dollars, so these politicians think, when the dollar drops in value, and they are able to raise more taxes at higher levels. But this only works if wages and earnings raise in tandem with inflation. \\nFor example, if sales tax is 6%, and I buy a can of beans for a $1.00 I pay 6 cents in taxes. When inflation hits and that can of beans now costs $3.00, I pay 18 cents in taxes. And my higher wages or salary move me up in the tax brackets, so I pay more taxes on the inflated dollars, as do corporations. \\nThe politicians will never say it, but that is the plan, just inflate this debt down to zilch, public be damned. Rob \\nBart, \\nI applaud your attempt to explain the situation\u2026 but it sounds like you are reciting a Economics 101 text book, and no offense intended, it would seem that you are not entirely knowledgeable of the facts. \\nYour post is entirely ignorant of the politics behind money. \\nWhat lead to our current situation? Your statement that the central banks lost control of the money supply is over simplification, at best, ignorance at worst. Over the past two decades, at the behest of powerful interest groups and lobbyist, Congress dismantled and restructured the then existing regulatory restrictions that protected the economy from the text book situation which you described. And the result? It was predicted many years ago\u2026 screamed from the mountaintops for anyone to hear. But no one paid attention. Technically those vested with the power to create law don\u2019t actually break the law. When the regulation and rule of law are manipulated, the eventual outcome of those changes are predictable. Knowledge is power. Ignorance is misfortune. \\nAs for runs on the bank\u2026 your illustration is a far cry from anything other than an illusion. While it is true that banks do not carry ready reserves of Cash on Hand to cover the cumulative balances of their accounts, the monies of the accounts themselves are properly recorded in the banks ledgers. Customers would not need to demand the balance in full, in cash. They could demand a cashiers check, or they could simply walk into another financial institution of their choosing and write a draft or check to transfer their monies from their old bank to their new institution. In the event of a bank failure, the proper action would have been to let the bank fail, at which point its assets would have been seized by the government, it deposits covered (to an extent) by FDIC, and then liquidated or managed in probate to recover losses on behalf of the injured parties. No Bail Outs would have been required. But there would have been a full accounting and investigation of corruption, mismanagement, maleficent, etc. Instead TARPs and Bailouts were appropriated and the monies were used to pay up to 100% on the dollar to the banks themselves, and subsequently the looting and pillaging of America began. \\nLet there be no doubt that our current economic crisis is very real, far from over, and deliberately engineered. What are the short and long term implications? As for credit and liquidity, Wall Street is flush, but Main Street has dried up. TARP funds and various bailouts have been used, not to extend credit to Main Street, but rather to starve out the middle class, small and medium businesses, local banks and middle America so that those whom have access and control of credit may buy up practically anything and everything of value for pennies on the dollar. Classic and textbook \u201cGrapes of Wraith\u201d Economics 101, where the Barons and Tycoons of Industry run rough shod over desperate peoples in tough times. The gains are privatized and the losses are socialized. \\nAs for the long term implications\u2026 Doubling the money supply with 0% interest devalues the dollar and lends itself to several carnations of inflation, which may only be offset by artificially dampening cost of infrastructure and labor. In other words, importing cheap labor and exporting manufacturing and industry. Ring any bells? Ironically this only excelerates the phenomena. \\nUltimately, this incomprehensible level of debt may only be solved one of two ways, if not both: 1) The yielding and merger of the American dollar into a new hyper national or international financial union, or 2) Negotiation or Eradication of Debt via the Conquest of Wars and Treaties. Hmm\u2026 have you been watching the news lately? G8 What? U.N. / IMF / World Bank are doing what exactly? What treaties have been pending on the horizon? Pray tell me, what exactly were the goals of The Project for the New American Century and the Council on Foreign Relations? Please tell me that you are at least somewhat familiar with the organizations that advise and create the policies that our Congress reviews and our President enacts as policy? \\nBottom line: this is an engineered crisis with but one ultimate goal. Not merely the consolidation of wealth, but a consolidation of Power. The Federal Reserve itself has undergone consolidation. And Wall Street. And Main Street. And soon\u2026 as we continue marching towards globalization via Conquest and Treaty and the expansion of Power\u2026 Our National Sovereignty. \\nAnd although I most certainly agree with you and applaud you on your preference for direct money creation where Congress creates money to pay for infrastructure to expand the economy, alas, there too you have unwittingly overlooked or intentionally omitted several key details. \\nAlthough Congress does have the constitutional authority to mint coin and regulate the value of domestic and foreign monies, and does stimulate the economy with monies spent on militaries, infrastructure, and commerce, it ultimately can not and should not be responsible for insuring our economy. That said, for better or for worse, with our burgeoning debt our prosperity is being washed away. \\nDebt is slavery. Expanding the money supply with fiat currency is a devils game. The only thing that truly generates wealth is labor and resources. You can not exploit resources without access, be it public or private, to land. Be it beef, beans, or bread, or be it lumber, steel, silver, or gold, without land the supply to resources is severed, and with it the capacitance for manufacturing and industry are also severed. \\nWe could easily transform our fiat money supply into that of one based entirely upon industrial and agricultural commodities, in addition to gold, silver, and other precious metals. But there in lies the crutch. Energy. For mining and harvesting, refinement and manufacturing, and for transportation. \\nWhat, pray tell, has our current economic crises entailed? Hmm\u2026 Land, I.e. Real Estate. Commodities and Industry, I.e. Main Street and Jobs. Energy, I.e. oil, gas, coal, and electricity. Financing, I.e. Credit, cash, and liquidity. What exactly have been several of the key issues facing most people these past several years? \\nDo you see the pattern yet. Do you recognize the cause, the reaction, the solution? It is NOT simply a matter of the central banks losing control of the money supply. It is about consolidation of financial and political power. Period. Once anyone realizes that, they will be better able to cope with the difficulties at hand and work towards regaining their financial footing, and hopefully, eventually, return to being financially independent. \\nWhen you are ready to set aside that primer for Economics 101 and start learning how things really work, I will be not only applauding you, but cheering you on. \\nBest wishes. Jason Seagraves \\nIt is not \u201cimpossible\u201d for the national debt to be paid off. It could theoretically be paid off without inflation, in fact. It would just take time. \\nIf the money creation was halted, for example, the debt could be paid off over a very long period of time in the following manner: \\n1. I am taxed $100. 2. The government uses my $100 to pay down the debt to China. 3. China uses this $100 to buy a product from my company. 4. My company is taxed on this sale. 5. The government takes that tax money and gives it to China, again, etc., etc., etc. bob Tom Dennen \\nSOME BROAD NOTES ON THE HISTORY OF MONEY (Without the complicated detail). by Tom Dennen, author of \u2018Grand Theft, Planet or Heidi\u2019s Free Bar & Grill\u2019\u2013 (free on the Internet). Most of this is probably deliberately scattered all over the Internet, and, if one just looks around a bit, people like me can pretend we have connected some dots. (There is, incidentally, nothing in here about the role Switzerland played in the years under scrutiny.) BUT: *Study the ancient goldsmiths\u2019 discovery of fractional lending and usury. *Read Book Six of Tacitus\u2019\u201cAnnals of Rome\u201d. *Read \u201cThe Great Reckoning\u201d by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg. *Consider the fact that you spend twenty of the most productive years of your life paying off a mortgage (deathcage) bond. *Wake up. This might help:\u201cApocalypse\u201d is a Greek word meaning \u201cthe lifting of the veil between you and God,\u201d (or Knowledge or Reality).\u201cThe modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in inequity and born in sin \u2026 Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them but leave them the power to create money, and, with a flick of a pen, they will create enough money to buy it back again \u2026 Take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, for then this would be a better and happier world to live in \u2026 But, if you want to continue to be the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit. \u201d Sir Josiah Stamp, director of the Bank of England and the second richest man in Britain in the 1920s, speaking at the University of Texas in 1927.\u201cIn a dark time, the eye begins to see,\u201d Theodore Roethke.\u201cCAPITALISM IS A SYSTEM THROUGH WHICH WEALTH IS REGULARLY TRANSFERED (STOLEN) FROM THOSE WHO CREATE IT TO THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY WEALTHY, WHILE THOSE WHO CREATE IT ARE KEPT UNAWARE OF THE THEFT BY \u2018THE MATRIX\u2019\u201d\u2013 t.d.\u201cAll wealth is created by work.\u201d\u2013 Adam Smith. It\u2019s becoming clear to many more people every day how the \u2018matrix\u2019\u2013 the system \u2013 works, and how the Internet is the leaky bucket out of which the truth (Apocalypse) is flying and the leaks \u2013 like Ellen Brown, Rense, What Really hAPPENED ET AL, are hopefully out of control. Since the early goldsmiths discovered fractional (reserve) banking, (created money out of thin air) and introduced predatory lending, they have been thrown out of every courntry they set up in, after which those countries returned to resource-based economies and went through several decades of economic recovery. Until the sixteenth century, in Holland. Then and there, when the goldsmiths were discovered plying their usurious debt / lending system, the already wealthy government and merchant classes simply joined them in the first full \u201ccollusion among corporatocracy, authoritarian government, controlled media and education.\u201d\u2013 Fascism. (Global Research). Add bankers to that conspiracy and you have the recipe for the last three hundred years of fiscal theft through market manipulation by \u2018The Establishment\u2019, The \u2018Elite\u2019, the \u2018Illuminati\u2019 or the \u201cRothschild Family\u2019, take your pick, but once government was in on the scam, the wealth that the lower and middle classes created by work was harvested every fifty years or so. Holland was, I believe, the site of the first experiment in money market manipulation by this collusion of classes.\u2018Tulip Mania\u2019 is regarded as seriously silly season stuff among some debunkers, but which today is also a generic for an \u2018out-of-control\u2019 Bull Market. The thing is, it was for keeps.\u2018Tulip Mania\u2019 is a controlled boom situation; controlled by those who run the Great Wealth Shift every generation, starting with the South Sea Bubble crash in 1720. This set of conclusions is largely gathered from a monetary history according to James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg: Every fifty years or so since the South Sea Crash, financial markets have peaked \u2013 and exactly nine years later, crashed \u2013 followed by a depression during which, bracketed by expensive wars, vast amounts of properties have been foreclosed and the \u2018masters\u2019 transfered huge amounts of the wealth accumulated by the working class \u2013\u201call wealth is created by work\u201d (Adam Smith) \u2013 who were left to starve. Just like today. THE SHIFT IN WORLD ECONOMIC PREDOMINANCE\u201cAll long-term credit cycles end with asset crashes in the markets of the leading economy. Measuring from crash to crash the dates of the modern credit cycles are as follows:\u201d(starting with the South Sea Bubble) Span Duration 1873 \u2013 1929 56 years 1929 \u2013 1990 61 years\u201cThe crashes and resulting depressions appear to be less intense and traumatic when the end of the cycle does not coincide with a shift in world economic predominance.\u201d\u2013 The Great Reckoning, James Dale Davidson & William Rees-Mogg, 1993. Recent benchmarks are Common Cause: 1907 Financial Panic 1913 The privately-owned American Federal Reserve (FED) System Created 1929 The Great Depression \u2013 (Nice work, FED and Benjamin Shalom B. is returned to office!!) 1933 Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Executive Order 6102 outlaws owning gold 1934 Gold Reserve Act freezes gold at $35 per ounce 1971 United States abandons gold standard 1974 U.S. citizens allowed to own gold 2009 Gold exceeds $1100 per ounce The depression following the 1990 crash is fully upon us and the consequences are global because we are in the middle of the biggest shift in world economic predominance. We will not see the end of it for a long while \u2013 all we will see are futile reports of the transfer of huge amounts of money to the banking cartels and hear their stories of \u2018green shoots\u2019 and \u2018recovery\u2019. Until people are back to work there is no recovery. The essence of fiscal control is not race, religion or nationality but just a passion for control over other humans. SOVEREIGN MONEY Both Lincoln and Kennedy were assassinated after introducing sovereign currencies, which were quickly removed from circulation after the killings. What happened to Schwartzenegger\u2019s IOUs? They were de facto sovereign currency paid back on maturity by the state at a 3.75% interest. (It took the entire western world including Russia, incidentally, to crush Hitler who had also introduced sovereign money against the web of banking debt). When the directors of the Bank of England asked what was responsible for the booming economy of the young American colonies, Benjamin Franklin explained that the colonial governments issued their own money, which they both lent and spent into the economy:\u201cIn the Colonies,\u201d he said, \u201cwe issue our own paper money. It is called \u2018Colonial Scrip.\u2019 We issue it in proper proportion to make the goods pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to no one. You see, a legitimate government can both spend and lend money into circulation, while banks can only lend significant amounts of their promissory bank notes, for they can neither give away nor spend but a tiny fraction of the money the people need.\u201cThus, when your bankers here in England place money in circulation, there is always a debt principal to be returned and usury to be paid. The result is that you have always too little credit in circulation to give the workers full employment. You do not have too many workers, you have too little money in circulation, and that which circulates, all bears the endless burden of unpayable debt and usury.\u201d (Wikipedia) One of the most significant \u2013 and Apocalyptic \u2013 leaks is Ellen Brown\u2019s book, \u2018Web of Debt\u2019 along with the Global Warming lies now out in the open. The Bilderbergs / governments / banks / merchants / landowners / fake scientists / Big Pharma and the rest are now too big not to fail at keeping their secrets. Solution? This will set us free: Return to resource-based economies. Do not borrow unless it\u2019s from a state, county, city or people-owned bank that does not charge interest. Gather together and itemize all the resources of your community and learn to barter. Keep your wealth to yourselves. \u2013 you created it. Above all, don\u2019t listen to snake oil salesmen like Obummer and Al Bore who are just stealing while callously killing your children for money.

It is disingenuous to mis-match securities to day zero. Asking for every dollar loaned over widely varying periods of maturity to be immediately returned is nonsensical. To put it in microeconomic terms, an individual on a $50k salary who borrows $200k, will pay about ~$1.4k per month over 25 years @ 7% pa. Were the borrower asked to repay the entire sum TODAY does that mean the borrower is insolvent? No. The borrower has 25 years of income, which if NPV\u2019d at a 7% discount rate, shows the borrower is quite solvent. If these data sets for US debt are to be put in their correct perspective, GDP must be summed for the same period at the debt, or its average maturity. To present the debt as a fraction of one year\u2019s GDP only is just bad math.

Suppose the debt is to China, for the supply of a billion t-shirts, 200 million microwave ovens, etc. To repay the debt the US has to create a billion t-shirts, 200 million microwave ovens etc (plus interest) more than it consumes. The important bit is that the debtor\u2019s production must be more than its consumption. \\nNow introduce money into the equation and start from zero cash in the US. The US has assets such as mining rights, so they can sell something to a dollar holder for cash. The cash can be used to repay debt, or it can be invested in productive activities which generate a profit. The tipping point for a country being or not being able to repay its debt is not related to the money supply. What you need to look at is the relationship between productivity, consumption, assets, debt and interest rates. Current and future generations of Americans need to (a) produce more than they consume to make up for the past generations which consumed more than they produced. Or they can (b) reject the inequitable system and default.

Your right on how the money supply works and expands, but your forgetting that money is still just pieces of paper floating around. They really do not have value. Our goods and services are what really has value. How would it be mathematically impossible to pay back our debt with our goods and services when our debt has not yet even reached the dollar amount of all goods and services we produce in 1 year. Not even one year worth of our goods and services (GDP) would be needed to pay the debt back. We have had much higher debt in the past comparably. This is if you actually look at our debt compared to GDP. This is like you would look at your own debt compared to your income in your household. If my debt was equal to my income this year, I might be very worried, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. jos boersema \\nHi, the founding fathers of the USA also said (iirc) that the people needed to be educated. For ppl (like me) who are not professionally in banking the money issue (in full) can seem complicated. I think that for sufficient political oversight #1 thing for a new system must be simplicity. Only what is simple people can understand, only what people can understand they can inspect, police & keep righteous. \\nWhat do you think of this system: a Gov issued fiat, legal tender law, fit for debt, and taxes payed in it. Now the money will work as money in exchange. Then a central gov owned bank as the infrastructural backbone, with collective accounts for banks (privacy from gov). Retail account & savings account services banks who are prohibited to lend out a single dime (inspected by gov), by law prohibited to lend anything. Then a separate mortgage & consumer credit sector, also heavily policed by gov. By law nobody can resell a loan to a third party. Then a third sector which handles business upstart & expansion credit, these investments are in the form of plain loans and can neither be traded to third parties. \\nIt is my understanding that this third sector has to be dominated by political will of the people, to prevent that sector from growing up those tiranical and corrupt corporations the USA founding fathers may have talked about. \\nThe money would then be spend into circulation and taxed out of it, the government never lends a single coin from anyone (only taxes). As a rule the (next) government never pays back loans, so that future govs won`t be able to get credit either \u2026 \\nI`d say this is simple, what people expect too. To round it off: international businesses are prohibited henceforth, and politics rules on import/export tariffs to protect its markets and industries out of long term self interest (at a cost to global economic effeciency).

Same for other liabilities (medicare!). So, when you portend the money will not be paid back then you are correct. The only problem is the losers are working Americans. Not Billionaires. Not Congress persons. Not the FED or their posse for sure! Fractional banking is a simple system to steal from those who produce value and give to those who control the printing press. Very simple. Very effective. (BTW, the legal limit in the UK is 666 fake credit bubble pounds to every actual pound on deposit. At least one bank made it up to 66 to 1 in 2008.)

How is this any different than what AIG did? The difference is they control the government and can take from the taxpayers. You cannot. The same for the FED. Imagine if you borrowed money from all of your friends and family to the point you borrowed $10,000 but you only really had $100. Well, that\u2019s fractional banking. To make it worse, imagine if you never even had the $100 in the first place but your brother had given you an IOU for it \u2013 even though he himself was broke!

The real problem is interest. When the money supply is expanded via fractional reserve banking it creates more money to be injected into the money supply. However loans also charge interest. Only the money created for the loan contract or principal is actually distributed in the money supply. The money to pay the interest is not created in the money supply, thus creates a system of perpetual inflation. This is a lose-lose situation for the person taking the loan for not only does the amount of money in the money supply not even exist to pay off the interest, but the original loan that was taken devalues the money we already have. This means that not only are bankruptcies inevitable, but everyone is taxed subversively via inflation.

You bargain and come to a mutual understanding of your product/service value, at the same time the product/service might be worth more/less in a different situation.

If you really believe it i will be more than happy to come to your house and relieve you of your excess paper. The value of anything is the result of supply and demand. The demand for US dollars derives from the laws mandating they be accepted for all debt public and private. The supply results from the government putting money in circulation. Where supply and demand meet we find the value of something. Paper money has no more or less inherent value than gold or anything else.

Furthermore, this discussion ignores the effect of crude oil on banking and money. A comprehensive discussion includes the effect of the petrodollar system on our currency. With that, we should include the impact of holding more crude oil within our borders than all the other proven oil reserves on earth.

It contains over 500 billion barrels of oil. Also, since 2006, it\u2019s been common knowledge in the oil industry that 1,000 feet beneath the surface of the Rocky Mountains lies the largest untapped oil reserve in the world. It holds more than 2 TRILLION barrels. On August 8, 2005 President Bush mandated its extraction. In four years of high oil prices none has been extracted and nearly all of us are unaware of its existence. These oil assets are coveted by the international banking cabal and the largest multinational industries because in a world reliant on crude oil, oil can be used as currency between nations. The size of ours guarantee global predominance. Currently the major multinational banks are colluding to take this wealth from the American citizens. They are in the process of creating a spectacular economic collapse of our fiat dollar system. With it will come a tremendous drop in our standard of living. This means more than resorting to \u201cHamburger Helper\u201d instead of filet mignon. It means increased infant mortality rates and decreased life expectancy. Afterwards we will surrender our constitutional government and our natural resources for the promise of regaining some modicum of our standard of living and relative affluence.

Certain people can press a few computer buttons and create hundreds of billions of dollars. If one person has the power to create hundreds of billions of dollars out of thin air, then what can the true value be? What work was done or product/service sold in order to productively create this new money? None. The value, the true value, is nonexistent. People value dollars because of faith and trust in the government which says they have value. The same government that prints the money out of thin air. \\nThe difference with gold as money, the reason why the founders of the United States mandated that only gold and silver were money, is that gold or silver cannot be created out of nothing by government bureaucrats. When governments are unable to create money out of thin air then they have no choice but to live within their means. But, governments living within their means equates to less interest income for the bankers\u2026 \\nAnother point about gold, it has an extremely long and successful track record as being accepted as money, for more than 5,000 years. All fiat currencies, of which the USD is, in the history of the world (aside from our current group of fiat currencies) have failed. Fiat has a very bad historical track record.

Paper bills were created to facilitate large transactions, but the bills were tied to gold redeemable at a quantity of grams of gold.

Ed Simple \\nMe? I\u2019m renouncing my citizenship and moving to Switzerland. Jim \\nI won\u2019t even begin to list the ways in which the article is dead wrong. A complete waste of time. If you\u2019re buying what this article is selling, you should look elsewhere for an education on how these systems work. The author doesn\u2019t know. Don \\nOK \u2013 First of all, the FED actually creates very little money in our fractional monetary system. In normal markets there is $800 Billion of US Treasury Notes (a debit entry) that has been moneterized into Federal Reserve Notes (a credit entry). Due to the enormous one-time (hopefully) money needs stemming from the fall-out of the credit crisis, the FED has mushroomed its balance sheet to approximately $2.3 Trillion from the aforementioned $800 Billion. This quantitative easing was necessary due to interest rate considerations, not because there was not enough money. Simply put, if the US Treasury had to issue a Trillion or so more in US Treasury Notes overnight, the interest rates would have sky-rocketed which would have put the chances for a recovery into the remote range. Moreover, the author implies that the FED is controlled a group of elites that and are absconding the money they make. This is only remotely true. The FED is independent of the US Government, so politics stay out of the banking sector. Moreover, the great majority of the money generated investments on the FED\u2019s books from US Treasuries, and now, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac paper is simply given back to the US Treasury. If that was not the case, you can be certain the Bernanke would not be re-appointed as FED Chairman by a vote of Congress. \\nSecondly, the majority of our money is created when banks make loans. When a banker makes a loan, he must retain a capital ratio of around 8%. My sense is that the author is inter-changably treating this 8% requirement as the approximate 10% reserve requirement that the FED has in place. When a bank makes a new loan it is debit on its books and the credit is a deposit into the borrowers account. Somebody has to clarify to me how money has been lost in this transaction. Say the loan is for $100,000\u2026 well, $100,000 is credited to the borrower, so how there a loss of 10%? When you borrow $100,000 from a bank, do you only receive $90,000 as the author seems to be implying? For EVERY DEBIT on the books, there is an equal CREDIT, unless the loan is not paid back. Of course, that is why an 8% capital requirement is in place, so that the loan loss can safely be offset against the bank\u2019s capital. \\nThirdly, the money supply is tight right now because banks have been contracting their balance sheets. This is being done by tightening credit standards. When less credit is being issued by banks a contraction in the macro money supply occurs. Likewise, when banks make loans, their balance sheets are made larger on both the asset and liability side (deposits or money) of their books and the macro money supply is expanded. \\nFourthly, part of the reason that the macro money supply is not expanding is due to loans losses that banks are taking due to the lack of supervision regarding the subprime debacle. When banks lose money, they very naturally become hesitant to make news loans that could result in further losses. Moreover, the loan loss means they have less capital and will have trouble maintaining the 8% capital requirement if they continue to make more loans, thereby expanding their balance sheet. A natural contraction occurs. That is what the FED is trying to partially offset by expanding its balance sheet, so the whole system does not implode. However, in context of the entire money supply, an extra Trillion on the FED\u2019s balance sheet is relative peanuts. \\nFifthly, the real threat to the US\u2019s money supply is trade imbalances. When the US imports more goods and services than it exports, the difference is made up by selling them our debt. Again, all the money created via the fractional monetary system has a debit and a credit\u2026 they equal. However, when foreigners end up owning our money because we traded it for goods and services, we do end up with less domestic money than we have debt. And, if that money does not eventually come back to the US in the form of trade surpluses we will not have enough money to pay our domestic debt with. However, the money did not somehow disappear. The debits still equal the credits. The problem is the foreigners have become our creditor and we are the debtors. \\nSixthly, debt based monetary systems are inherently dependent upon the money continuing to circulate. When people become scared and start hording money instead of keeping a healthy amount of it in circulation, there will be a lack of money to service debt. It is not unwise to save money, but when the macro savings rate is high enough to result in a contraction of economic activity, we will have a debt servicing issue.

Top THAT, Wall Street! \\nBut I didn\u2019t buy it for speculation \u2013 I bought it to PRESERVE the money I worked hard for. \\nIf the economy crashes and your beloved Federal Reserve Note becomes as worthless as a German Deutchmark between the years 1917-1921, you will see the folly of keeping your wealth in paper dollars! \\nNo, you can\u2019t spend gold at the hardware store or at Wal-Mart but when the dust clears and a new currency replaces the failed one, I have enough gold to buy all the Amero\u2019s or Euro\u2019s or whatever currency I will need. \\nWhen people refer to people who hold this mindset as being \u201cgold bugs\u201d, you can rest assured those people probably make money by peddling paper \u201cinvestments\u201d. \\nSo what\u2019ll it be? Value based on a metal that requires labor and investment in order to be extracted out of the ground? (And has been prized as true wealth since before Biblical times?) Or value based on printed paper. Something that a private group of elite bankers manipulate the value of? \\nChoose wisely! Kate Jensen \\nIt is clear that the first step is to stop any additional debt. The boat is almost full of water, stop the increase so a plan can be made to reduce what is already in. As people can not find jobs and have time on their hands bartering will become more common, they will trade work or items for things of survival. Neal \\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve is a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers.\u201d \\nAm I missing something here? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_reserve says that the Fed is not owned and is not private and is not for profit, which is what I recollected. \\nThis destroys the credibility of the article for me. woot \\nyou have just enough info to be dangerous \u2013 try to increase your rational thought. \\none quick point because i\u2019m in a hurry: \\nsaying it\u2019s \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d is a misnomer. if you have no money for deposit (but a good job) and buy a $30k car with a loan, (as soon as you buy it the car is worth $20k or less), so you have a $30k debt and now only $20k in assests. is that \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d to repay? no. you promise to pay it with your _future earnings_, which is what the entire debt system is based on. \\nthis completely refutes your point 2: #2) The only way to create more money is to go into even more debt which makes the problem even worse. \\nno, the other way is to _work off the debt_. luckily, the government is spending on infrastructure and education so the people will be able to produce enough to pay off that debt. oops, sorry, no, they\u2019re spending on wars. my bad. \\nthe issue isn\u2019t debt, it\u2019s what you spend the money on! Rampart \\nDear \u201cBystander\u201d\u2013 gold has been money for 5,000 years. It is a reliable store of wealth because it can\u2019t be printed out of thin air. If you think fiat currency is as good as gold, I refer you to recent events in Zimbabwe and Argentina. Good luck holding on to your bits of printed paper\u2026 perhaps you can use your FRN\u2019s for building fires like this woman from the Weimar Republic. \\nPS \u2013 the \u201cdemand\u201d for federal reserve notes came as a result of the Breton Woods agreement. At the time that document was penned, our dollars were in fact backed by gold. Since abandoning the gold standard, foreign governments have little reason to hold the FRN in reserve. Mark \\nIncorrect. Interest payments are about 4% of GDP. Kick that up to 5% of GDP and the debt would be paid off over time. \\n\u201cYou see, the truth is that the U.S. government now owes more dollars than actually exist\u201d \\nThat is the nature of debt: there is always more debt than money, except in very primitive economies. Even on the gold standard that was true. John Sawyer \\nThe government can still issue money in the form of coins. Maybe we should all pay for things with a lot of loose change! PleaseExpalin \\nGlenn Peters , \\nNo-one has answered my question above. You seem very knowledgeable. Would you like to answer my question please? \\nThe article says \\n\u201c We could solve this problem by shutting down the Federal Reserve and restoring the power to issue U.S. currency to the U.S. Congress. But the politicians in Washington D.C. are not about to do that. \u201d \\nMy question is \\nIf it does solve this problem, so why do we not do that? Is there any real practical problem with that, or is it just an ideological issue? 3-D \\nThere is no way to fix it now and no way out. The best solution is to hunker down, let it all burn down around you as social disorder asserts itself, and try to come out alive. If you do, you\u2019ll be a part of rebuilding the country, this time hopefully NOT under control of bankers with specific unchangeable parts of the Constitution that EXPLICITLY FORBID handing the money supply over to private banks of any kind. David Smith \\nJFK has already signed an Executive Order for the issue of debt free Treasury Notes and the Notes were printed and ready to go into circulation when he was killed. His Executive Order is still legally in effect but no one has had the courage since then to implement it. Immediately after they killed him, and he was not the 1st President to be killed for this reason, the newly printed Treasury Notes were destroyed. The President we now have like many before him are owned by the owners of the Federal Reserve (House of Rothschild) or their agents (George Soros etc.). If these people finally get kicked out of our country and the chance is slim because the American People will probably never understand or care about the financial system since these very same people control our minds using many methods but mainly through television, they will probably remotely militarily destroy what little remains of our economy, society, and country that they were not able to destroy while here. They will destroy it out of vengeance and desperation because it is their nature to destroy. The U.S.A. is not the only country they control against the will of the majority of it\u2019s people. They hate the U.S. Constitution because it is based on God\u2019s Laws and because we have been a Christian society. Still though, I believe that forgiving them for destroying us physically is the right thing to do. I\u2019m not sure though if I will be able to follow through on my belief if some day I find my back up against a wall. It seems like that day is quickly approaching for most of us. Why do all of the JFK documentaries present every possibility of who did it to confuse but none ever mention this one fact? Brophanity \\n@web ether-net ideas \\nyour ideations of a barter system are ok, but it really doesnt make sense to \u201ctrade\u201d anything. If you just gave people what they needed from what you were producing, and they just gave to you as needed from what they produced, things would be a lot easier. If you understand there is no real need for money, then it shouldnt be a big stretch to see that people would be happier if they only took what was necessary, and then only more than that as long as it didnt deprive others Glenn Peters \\nPleaseExpalin asked: \\nDoes shutting down down the Federal Reserve and restoring the power to issue U.S. currency to the U.S. Congress solve this problem, if so why do we not do that?
