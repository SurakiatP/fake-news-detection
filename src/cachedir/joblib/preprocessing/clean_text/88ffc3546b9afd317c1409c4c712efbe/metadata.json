In 2010, a run of   interviews changed the course of his career as both a musician and a celebrity. \u201cOnly recently do I make decisions about putting a record or a video out that aren\u2019t saddled with guilt,\u201d he said this month in Los Angeles. \u201cI feel like I have a) done the work and b) been out long enough so that people can believe I\u2019ve done the work. \u201d He added: \u201cIt took me five years to go, \u2018O. K. come on, let\u2019s go back to the party. You\u2019re not going to make a fool of yourself. \u2019\u201d As Mr. Mayer prepped for the release next month of his new album, \u201cThe Search for Everything,\u201d which he hopes will be return to the pop mainstream, I trailed him between the recording studio and a shoot for a music video, a frenetic four days capped by an additional   interview over dinner. Below are some additional edited excerpts from our hours of conversation. (You can read the full story here.) \u201cYour No. 1 Google result is a certain thing, but you\u2019ve got to do something bigger than that to knock it off of first place. For me, when I was at my most popular, I maligned myself. It\u2019s a very interesting thing because if, when you mellow out in your life, it\u2019s the wrong time . .. I think a lot of people\u2019s last impression of me is outdated. \u201cAs I autopsy that part of my life, it turns out that I was under the impression that I was a bigger star than I was. I appreciate that there was a market correction. I actually really do. There was a market correction and I\u2019m probably about as big as I should be. \u201d [He quickly revised this statement.] \u201cI\u2019d like to be a little bigger. \u201d \u201cMy brother just had a baby. That\u2019ll rattle you, man. I\u2019m looking at these pictures of him giving her a bath when I\u2019m lying in a hotel penthouse in Hollywood and it\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9. The oxytocin flows freely in my brain when I see that stuff. \u201c[For me,] everything anatomically and chemically is healthy. It works. All the mechanisms are in place. It\u2019s just the life that I have, which is fabulous  \u2014   it\u2019s just a bit more time on the International Space Station. Don\u2019t ever let me give you the sense that I don\u2019t love being on the International Space Station. It\u2019s a pretty cool reason why you haven\u2019t settled down  \u2014   because you\u2019re an astronaut. I\u2019ve never hated it. Sometimes I get upset at the way that it is, but the real question is: Will the appearance of this job prevent what I\u2019m absolutely entitled to psychologically? That\u2019s the scary part. \u201cI\u2019m still always going to be a kid from Fairfield, Conn. They don\u2019t make rock stars in Fairfield, Conn. They don\u2019t. They make good people who get a job, get married, they watch TV together, they start a life together and make other good people. \u201d \u201cI live for FedEx tracking numbers. I have a FedEx tracking number that\u2019s so hot right now I\u2019ll be watching it all night like Norad tracking Santa Claus. It\u2019s from Japan, it\u2019s getting here tomorrow. But [my stuff] gets held up in customs a lot because it\u2019s so much Japanese clothing that customs is like, \u2018What store is this going to?\u2019 Like, no, it\u2019s a person. \u2018It can\u2019t be going to a person, this is too much commercial value. \u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018Your Body Is a Wonderland\u2019 lives so much in its own atmosphere that it\u2019s like it\u2019s been handed to me by some other person. There was a time where I didn\u2019t want to play it, where I took it very personally that people were making jokes about it. Now I go: \u2018It\u2019s kind of cool to have one.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve made it if you don\u2019t have the one [thing] that the least initiated person can yell at you when they see you. Dave Chappelle has Rick James, you know?\u201d \u201cWe live in a time right now where the message will be judged against the messenger. There are times when I say to myself, \u2018I don\u2019t have the right to.\u2019 Because I haven\u2019t introduced myself to the world or placed myself as a mouthpiece in that way, I guess I shied away from it. \u201d \u201cI had the most incredible time there and I learned a lot about who I used to be, because I used to have my heart out in front of me to every person I met. It didn\u2019t matter who you were. I didn\u2019t have time to make a value judgment. Everybody would get to look at it and touch it and put their gum out on it. And I would leave sad because I would go in with this huge, heavy beating heart for somebody to come put their arms around me and think I was great. And they just wouldn\u2019t because you don\u2019t do that at a party. \u201cBut I go through the therapy and I grow up and I dig out the things that were stuck in the fibers. [At the party,] I didn\u2019t put my heart out to anybody that I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t even bother going up to people that I didn\u2019t know. The thing I told myself, which is so healthy  \u2014   so please don\u2019t tell me that I\u2019m wrong  \u2014   was: \u2018She doesn\u2019t care about me.\u2019 It\u2019s not my job to win them all over. \u201d \u201cYou are not included in something if you are a solo artist. You cannot feel inclusion. You cannot feel being under a wing. I had never before been out of that role where you are in the saddle and everything is your call and all eyes are on you. Since I was a teenager! I was just there as a piece of their puzzle. \u201d \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019ll happen: Some people will write, \u2018I can\u2019t front, John Mayer\u2019s got moves, though.\u2019 And some people are going to write, \u2018John Mayer looks hideously dumb dancing.\u2019 Here\u2019s my prediction: The people who say that I have moves aren\u2019t fans of mine and the people who say that I was hideous and made a fool of myself are   John Mayer fans. Because they just don\u2019t see me that way. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563481.1268153}
