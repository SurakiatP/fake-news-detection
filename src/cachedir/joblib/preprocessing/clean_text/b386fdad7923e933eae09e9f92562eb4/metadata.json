[State Secretary of Health Dr. Karen Murphy ordered the Hillcrest Women\u2019s Medical Center to suspend its services following a June 5 unannounced inspection found \u201cserious deficiencies and violations,\u201d said a press release.  Three Pennsylvania state senators responded to the report of Hillcrest\u2019s violations with questions about why the Department of Health (DOH) has not revoked the abortion clinic\u2019s license, reports CatholicNewsLive. Hillcrest has violated the state\u2019s health laws four times in the past six years. State Sens. Joe Scarnati (R) Bob Mensch (R) and John DiSanto (R) wrote to Murphy: The DOH inspection report portrays a facility which is clearly unsafe and unhealthy for both patients and staff alike. Given this, we would like an explanation as to why DOH did not immediately move to suspend or revoke Hillcrest Women\u2019s Medical Center\u2019s license upon finding such numerous egregious violations. These health and safety violations are obviously deeply troubling. However, even more problematic appears to be DOH\u2019s response, which was to allow the abortion clinic to continue operating while granting Hillcrest a six month grace period to correct the cited \u201cdeficiencies. \u201d During an inspection in February, the abortion clinic was found to have improper staffing  \u2014   no registered nurse on staff, and failure to show documentation that its physician was a board eligible   the Department of Health\u2019s report says. Hillcrest was also found to have failed compliance with the state\u2019s Child Protective Services Law. The clinic has been treating girls younger than 18 years of age, though at least eight staff members had not had the background checks required for working with children. According to the report, the Department of Health reviewed 12 patient records and found all 12 patients had no nursing care or monitoring while recovering from anesthesia administered during surgical abortion. Murphy said in the department\u2019s statement: The health and safety of patients served at any Pennsylvania health care facility is a top priority of the Wolf Administration. On Monday, Department of Health staff conducted an unannounced monitoring visit to Hillcrest Women\u2019s Medical Center. The department concluded that it was no longer safe for the facility to continue providing medical services to patients. Therefore, I have ordered the facility to suspend all services until such time that it can demonstrate it is safe for women to receive care. While the June inspection found that a registered nurse was on the premises, additional violations were identified  \u2014   including expired sterilization and medical supplies  \u2014   that led to the decision to close the clinic. \u201cThe Hillcrest Women\u2019s Medical Center deserved to be closed down, but the truth is that the March deficiency report was far from the worst we have seen in our research of abortion facilities,\u201d says   Operation Rescue president Troy Newman. \u201cAll abortion facilities that cannot pass health inspections should be closed. We urge every state to conduct unannounced inspections of abortion facilities so they can see the real conditions and practices women face at these abortion dumps on an everyday basis. \u201d Hillcrest\u2019s violations come after Pennsylvania enacted a law in 2011 requiring abortion clinics to be subject to unannounced inspections. The law was passed following the case of West Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted in 2013 of murdering babies born alive during abortions by cutting their spinal cords. Gosnell, who operated a clinic that became known as the \u201chouse of horrors\u201d because of its filthy conditions, also was found guilty in the death of one of his patients. The abortion industry and its political and media allies continue to fight against states in court that pass health and safety laws that would raise the standard of care in abortion clinics to those of other outpatient treatment facilities. The abortion lobby claims these laws are unfair to women who wish to access the procedure. In its latest investigative report,   organization Americans United for Life (AUL) provides details of hundreds of violations of state laws regulating abortion clinics. The   report, titled \u201cUnsafe: The Public Health Crisis in America\u2019s Abortion Clinics Endangers Women,\u201d challenges the narrative advanced by abortion advocates that the U. S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the recent Texas case of Whole Woman\u2019s Health vs. Hellerstedt prevents state legislatures from requiring health and safety standards in abortion clinics.'"}, "time": 1742564480.7980044}
