S. needs to consider military action to disrupt Iran\u2019s malign activities in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, which have intensified since the Islamic Republic signed a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015, a top American commander warned American lawmakers. [Former President Barack Obama and other supporters of the nuclear deal argued that it would promote peace and avoid military confrontation.  Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of U. S. Central Command (CENTCOM) testified Wednesday before the House Armed Services Committee about the security challenges facing his area of responsibility (AOR).  The Central Region, or CENTCOM AOR, spans more than 4 million square miles that cover 20 predominantly Muslim nations that stretch from Northeast Africa across the Middle East to Central and South Asia. In his written testimony, Gen. Votel declared: Iran poses the most significant threat to the Central Region and to our national interests and the interests of our partners and allies. We have not seen any improvement in Iran\u2019s behavior since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) addressing Iran\u2019s nuclear program, was finalized in July 2015. Over the past year, after the nuclear deal was signed, the U. S. military has been dealing with Iran and its proxies carrying out \u201ca range of malign activities\u201d in the Central Region, namely in \u201cIraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Egypt, the Sinai, and the    Strait [located between Yemen and Djibouti and Eritrea] and in other parts of our area of responsibility,\u201d declared Gen. Votel. Democrat Congresswoman Jacky Rosen from Nevada asked the top U. S. general during the hearing, \u201cDo you believe Iran has increased destabilizing activity since the JCPOA?\u201d \u201cI do believe they have,\u201d responded Gen. Votel, adding in his written remarks: Unfortunately, the [nuclear] agreement has led some to believe that we have largely addressed the Iranian problem set and that is not the case. In addition to its nuclear weapons potential, Iran presents several credible threats. They have a robust theater ballistic missile program, and we remain concerned about their cyber and maritime activities, as well as the activities of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  \u2014   Qods Forces ( ) and their network of affiliates, [including their   proxy Hezbollah]. Since the nuclear agreement was signed, Iran has been \u201cclearly focused\u201d on expanding its influence and power in the Central Region, noted Votel. \u201cRecognizing that Iran poses the greatest   threat to U. S. interests in the Central Region, we must seize opportunities to both reassure our allies and shape Iran\u2019s behavior,\u201d he pointed out, adding, \u201cThrough both messaging and actions, we must also be clear in our communications and ensure the credibility of U. S. intentions. \u201d To disrupt Iran\u2019s growing threat, the U. S. must consider military action and other ways, proclaimed Gen. Votel. \u201cI\u2019ve had an opportunity to talk with some of our regional partners about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need to look at opportunities where we can disrupt through military means or other means, their activities. \u201d \u201cIn addition to ready military actions, we must support the broader USG [U. S. Government] strategy with regard to Iran which should include new diplomatic initiatives that provide Iran with viable alternatives to its present course,\u201d he conceded. The U. S. general did stress that Iran must be aware that there will be consequences if it continues its malign and provocative activities. \u201cThe point that I would emphasize to you is that while there may be other more strategic or consequential threats or regions in our world, today, the central region has come to represent the nexus for many of the security challenges our nation faces,\u201d warned the CENTCOM commander. \u201cMost importantly, the threats in this region continue to pose the most direct threat to the U. S. homeland and the global economy. Thus it must remain a priority and be resourced accordingly,\u201d added Gen. Votel. The   region is home to the largest concentration of U. S. and United   terrorist groups  \u2014   13 in Afghanistan and seven in Pakistan, according to the U. S. military. Moreover, \u201cthe Middle East remains the global epicenter of terrorism and violent Islamist extremism,\u201d wrote Gen. Votel. Citing the Institute for Economics and Peace\u2019s 2016 Global Terrorism Index, he testified that \u201cthe U. S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) AOR accounted for 78% of all terrorism incidents worldwide. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563327.919217}
