Donald Trump\u00e2\\x80\\x99s treatment of women was given 102 minutes of evening news airtime, more than that allocated to discussing Clinton\u00e2\\x80\\x99s e-mail scandal (53 minutes) and the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play scandals (40 minutes) combined. \\nFor this study, the MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). The networks devoted 1,191 minutes to the presidential campaign during this period, or nearly 29 percent of all news coverage. \\nI would say something about how if Trump loses, the Jews are going to be blamed. \\nBut now, there is not really any chance whatsoever that Trump is going to lose. \\nHonestly fam, I\u2019m a bit salty about no pogroms. \\nAh, but the Jew butthurt when Trump takes control is going to be just as beautiful as a pogrom.'"}, "time": 1742563513.1819327}
