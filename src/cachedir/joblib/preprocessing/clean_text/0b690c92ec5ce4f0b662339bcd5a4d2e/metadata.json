Mr. Snitzer, 66, had a lot riding on this fair. He was the only local dealer selected for every Art Basel Miami Beach since its 2002 debut and one of only two Miami gallerists in this year\u2019s edition, which concluded on Sunday evening. Despite that rarefied position, and the resultant sniping from his hometown rivals, he still felt uncertain about his role in the larger art world pecking order  \u2014   and hopeful about using exposure at Basel to leap to the next economic rung. \u201cGagosian has hundreds of thousands of square feet in galleries all over the world,\u201d he noted with exasperation about the powerhouse dealer Larry Gagosian, \u201cand people in Miami think I\u2019m the one in control?\u201d Unlike   name brands such as   Basquiat or Andy Warhol, whose paintings sell themselves, Mr. Snitzer\u2019s represented artists include emerging talents like the    sculptor Rafael Domenech, whose work was being showcased at the Hyde by its developer, Jorge M. P\u00e9rez, the billionaire named on the facade of the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami. To help distinguish the Hyde, a new   just north of Miami, Mr. P\u00e9rez had commissioned a nearly $400, 000 artwork from Mr. Domenech, a sprawling installation that featured   rings above the building\u2019s entryway and its scrambling automobile valets. Mr. Snitzer was keen to show off the installation  \u2014   and Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s imprimatur. \u201cI want this kid to have a career for the rest of his life,\u201d he said of his hopes for his artist, who had been his student at a Miami fine arts program after Mr. Domenech immigrated from Cuba in 2010. The Domenech opening was a bit of a bust. Strong winds kept the desultory crowd out of the scenic pool area and clumped awkwardly in the lobby. Mr. P\u00e9rez continued the party at his penthouse in an adjoining   as more global   arrived. His walls were filled with artwork, as well as a handy list to help visitors identify it, from the kitchen\u2019s Sol LeWitt painting to a hallway\u2019s Robert Motherwell tapestry. It should have been a perfect networking moment. But Mr. Snitzer was shortly heading for the door. \u201cI hate schmoozing,\u201d he admitted sheepishly, aware that this was a serious liability in a trade built on personal connections. Tuesday morning found Mr. Snitzer in better spirits. Six paintings by Hernan Bas hung in his downtown Miami gallery  \u2014   striking portraits of waifish young men in states of tropical repose  \u2014   and the reaction was immediate from the   crowd. Within two hours, three works priced between $105, 000 and $135, 000 had sold, with Mr. Bas and Mr. Snitzer set to evenly split the proceeds. Mr. Bas, who grew up in Miami and now divides his time between here and Detroit, began showing with Mr. Snitzer in 1998, as a    \u201cwhen I couldn\u2019t even drink the wine at my own openings. \u201d Today he has an art star\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 full of museum exhibitions and representation by   galleries in New York and London. Yet these latest paintings went to Mr. Snitzer \u201cout of loyalty,\u201d Mr. Bas explained. \u201cSometimes artists go off to work with big names and they learn the hard way. \u201d Mr. Bas pointed to his experience with the   New York gallerist Daniel Reich. After Mr. Reich committed suicide in 2013, The New York Times saluted him as among a group of innovative young dealers \u2018\u2018tacking against the trend toward a more   sleek,   business. \u201d Mr. Reich had great success placing Mr. Bas\u2019s paintings with marquee collectors. But Mr. Bas said that receiving payment was another matter: \u201cHe just stopped returning my calls and responding to my emails. When he died, he owed me $140, 000. \u201d Mr. Bas added that several of his artist friends had similarly struggled to collect on sales from   dealers. \u201cIt\u2019s so much more rampant than anyone talks about. \u201d By way of contrast, he concluded warmly, \u201cPapa Snitzer has always been there for me. \u201d There was little time for a victory lap on Mr. Snitzer\u2019s part. He paused to stare in disbelief at his opening\u2019s catering bill of several thousand dollars. \u201cThey\u2019re charging $250 to rent us flowers for two hours?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t even get to keep the flowers?\u201d After a resigned shake of his head, he headed out to finish installing his Basel booth at the Miami Beach Convention Center. The setting there evoked an explosion in a Bubble Wrap factory as an army of installers swarmed about, unpacking, measuring and hammering. The painter Chuck Close sped through the debris in a motorized wheelchair, off to oversee the hanging of his artwork, followed by a forklift whose protruding blades passed ominously close to an Alex Katz painting. Mr. Domenech was right alongside Mr. Snitzer, hanging his own sculptures and choreographing an array of spotlights. At $65, 000 for the booth\u2019s 807 square feet, every rented inch was put to its most aesthetically enticing use. Add in setup costs, and the gallery owed $80, 000 before Mr. Snitzer had sold a single piece. \u201cI\u2019m paying the same per square foot as Gagosian,\u201d he explained, except that Mr. Gagosian needs to sell just one of his   artworks to cover expenses. Mr. Snitzer\u2019s strategy? To showcase his thriving midcareer artists like Mr. Bas, Enrique Mart\u00ednez Celaya and Kenny Scharf  \u2014   all of whom can attract fresh eyes to his younger artists and subsidize his display of their   work. At Wednesday morning\u2019s V. I. P. opening, the Basel crowd was noticeably thinner than in past years, though boldfaced names were still in evidence. The   impresario Sean Combs stopped at Snitzer\u2019s booth, bringing his entourage of   assistants and children to a sudden halt. Mr. Combs zeroed in on a young woman gazing at abstract paintings by Eli Sudbrack  \u2014   better known as Assume Vivid Astro Focus. When she displayed little enthusiasm for Mr. Combs\u2019s repeated inquiries about her favorite art, or his invitation to an event of his that night, he and his pack moved on. \u201cHe was working it hard there,\u201d Mr. Snitzer said with a sympathetic chuckle for a fellow pitchman. Mr. Domenech\u2019s two $10, 000 sculptures were the first pieces to be snapped up. By early afternoon there were also two holds on Mr. Bas\u2019s $120, 000 painting  \u2014   then Douglas Ray and Richard Segal arrived, executives from a New York real estate investment firm. Calls were rapidly placed, both holds were released, and there was a sudden crackle of anticipation. As Mr. Ray, the buyer, explained later, this was his first major art purchase  \u2014   \u201cIt just captured me\u201d  \u2014   and he was unsure of the mechanics for closing a sale. But after spying an already sold Bas artwork at the Lehmann Maupin booth, he wasn\u2019t going to lose out twice. Mr. Segal, a Basel veteran, jumped in to finalize the price. \u201cWhat can you do for my friend?\u201d Mr. Segal asked, reminding Mr. Snitzer that he was also a trustee at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Mr. Snitzer offered the 10 percent standard industry discount  \u2014   a sum almost always built into the asking price. Mr. Ray started hedging, asking about other Bas works, and Mr. Snitzer began to pull up some images on an iPad. Mr. Segal wryly chided the dealer, \u201cNever lose a sale. \u201d Mr. Snitzer picked up his cue and quickly assured Mr. Ray that his painting was the best available. \u201cO. K. done,\u201d Mr. Segal thundered, with an outstretched handshake. An invoice would be sent and the painting shipped upon payment. The entire $108, 000 transaction lasted barely five minutes. By 8 p. m. and the close of the fair\u2019s first day, other dealers had uncorked Champagne, but Mr. Snitzer simply sat for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m 66 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 40 years, and I\u2019m finally in the best position I\u2019ve ever been in. \u201d So what was on tonight\u2019s agenda? Mr. Snitzer turned incredulous: \u201cCan\u2019t I take a nap now?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561946.377366}
