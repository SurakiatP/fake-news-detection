Gove told his wife that and he and their son would be back when they were back, and not to wait up. A source said: \u201cMichael and his son went out in the afternoon and had a whale of a time. They had ice creams and fizzy pop and they even managed to walk around the Natural History museum after every one else had gone.\u201d \u201c They got photos of themselves with the dinosaurs and everything.\u201d Gove and son returned to their hotel room at 11.30pm after a roller disco, all pooped out from their adventures and ready for bed. Gove\u2019s wife Sarah Vine said: \u201cAs much as I\u2019m annoyed that they didn\u2019t tell me where they were going, I was happy to have them out of my hair for a few hours. Last time this happened Michael was sick from eating too many sweets.\u201d Michael Gove then slept soundly, right through the night, only waking once after a nightmare about a tyrannosaurus rex with Boris Johnson\u2019s head chasing him through the Houses of Parliament. \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742562242.979628}
