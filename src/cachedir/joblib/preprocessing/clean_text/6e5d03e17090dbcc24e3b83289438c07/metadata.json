But by far, the most unusual thing about the episode, advocates for people with disabilities have said, was not the abuse itself, but the fact that it was recorded. Violence against people with disabilities is far more common than most people realize, advocates have said, and frequently goes undetected or is not taken seriously. The victim in the attack here, an    white man, suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, prosecutors said in court papers filed on Friday. The four accused attackers, ranging in age from 18 to 24, are black. The four appeared on Friday in Cook County Circuit Court and Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered them held without bail. The defendants are accused of multiple felonies, including hate crimes. Prosecutors said the victim, who was found by the police on Tuesday, was targeted based on his race and his disability. During a Facebook video made by one of the defendants, another can be heard denouncing white people, and, at one point, a man is heard saying he does not care if the victim is schizophrenic. \u201cI\u2019m wondering as I\u2019m hearing this, \u2018Where was the sense of decency?\u2019 \u201d Judge Kuriakos Ciesil asked. In explaining her denial of bail, she added, \u201cHow do you put someone out there who has allegedly committed such horrible offenses against a person?\u201d People with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes as those without disabilities, according to a Justice Department report based on Census Bureau surveys. And people with mental disabilities are the most likely to be victimized. But some advocates claim the disparity is actually much greater, saying crimes against those with disabilities are less likely to be pursued by law enforcement. They believe people with disabilities may be unable to take part in a survey or go to the police, or may have trouble being understood. As a result, their complaints often are not taken seriously. \u201cThere are probably thousands of other cases just like this one in Chicago, and in some cases worse, that will never see the impact of the justice system because folks don\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Rebecca Cokley, the executive director of the National Council on Disability, a federal agency. \u201cIn a lot of cases with people with disabilities, the perpetrators are family members or caretakers, so what happens when the person who would have to take you to the police station is your abuser?\u201d Advocates have said the underlying problem is a pervasive attitude, conscious or not, that people with disabilities are not fully human. They pointed to a recent case in Idaho, where a white high school football player was charged with shoving a coat hanger into the rectum of another teenager, who was black and had mental disabilities, after having harassed the student and directed racial slurs at him for months. Though the accused student was 18 at the time of the assault, he was sentenced to probation rather than prison. \u201cWe have, unfortunately, devalued disabled people forever, which means we devalue their suffering,\u201d said Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cWhat we experience all the time is that police, prosecutors, judges say, \u2018Oh, this case is hard, it\u2019s not worth our trouble. This person is hard to understand, or they\u2019re not credible, or they won\u2019t stand up to  . \u2019\u201d Mr. Decker said that when Congress spent years drafting, debating, and finally voting on hate crimes legislation, which passed in 2009, it was a struggle to ensure that it punished crimes singling out people with disabilities, as well as bias based on categories like race or sex.   of the 50 states have hate crimes laws, according to the   League, but 17 of them do not specify people with disabilities as a protected group. Vilissa Thompson, an organizer of the Harriet Tubman Collective, a coalition of advocates for disabled black people, said, \u201cPeople are ignorant about the extent of violence against disabled people, but what\u2019s worse is that there\u2019s this kind of misplaced sympathy for the perpetrator, especially when it\u2019s a parent or caregiver. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628590.2629554}
