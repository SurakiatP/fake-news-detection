[Bloomberg, who has been harshly critical of President Trump, thought Democratic   would make Trump the odds on favorite in 2020.  \u201cThey\u2019ll step on each other and   Donald Trump,\u201d he told the Times\u2018s Frank Bruni, adding that there is a \u201c55 percent chance he gets  . \u201d Bruni, for his part, was horrified by the estimate. \u201c  percent? Whether good for my longevity or not, I need a cookie,\u201d he wrote, comparing the campaign to unseat Trump to Bloomberg\u2019s   crusades against smoking and junk food. Bloomberg was brutal in his critique of Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid for the White House. \u2018Hillary said, \u2018Vote for me because I\u2019m a woman and the other guy\u2019s bad,\u2019\u201d he said. The   former mayor has a long and tumultuous history with the president. Despite Trump\u2019s occasional praise of his fellow NYC billionaire\u2019s time as leader of the Big Apple, things turned ugly after Trump\u2019s presidential campaign kicked off.

In March, he appeared to defy the president and Congress, saying America will meet the requirements of the Paris climate agreement regardless of what the democratically elected government tries to do.'"}, "time": 1742561954.772809}
