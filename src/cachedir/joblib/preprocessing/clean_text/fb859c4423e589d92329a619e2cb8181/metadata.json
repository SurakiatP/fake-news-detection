Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah, principal cast members who had been with \u201cS. N. L. \u201d since 2010 and contributed many key impersonations on the program, are both leaving the show, as is Jon Rudnitsky, a featured player who appeared during the   season. Their departures were confirmed by Lauren Roseman, a press representative for NBC. Presidential contests tend to bring added focus and intensity to \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d which will have its season premiere on Oct. 1. That NBC sketch comedy series is renowned for its sendups of the electoral horse race, its lampooning of political figures and appearances from their   counterparts. Mr. Killam, who was promoted to the main cast of \u201cS. N. L. \u201d in 2012, had contributed impressions of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Killam had briefly played the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, but ceded that role to Darrell Hammond, who has played Mr. Trump for several decades. Mr. Pharoah, who was also promoted to the main cast in 2012, had been the show\u2019s resident impersonator of President Obama and Ben Carson. Mr. Killam, an alumnus of the Groundlings comedy troupe and a star of films like \u201cThe Heat,\u201d told the website Uproxx that, though he still had one year remaining on his   contract, he was not being brought back to the show. \u201cI had sort of had it in my head I would make this upcoming year my last year, but then heard they weren\u2019t going to pick up my contract,\u201d Mr. Killam said in the Uproxx interview. \u201cI was never given a reason why, really. I can assume until the cows come home. \u201d A representative for Mr. Pharoah declined to comment. Representatives for Mr. Rudnitsky also declined to comment. While these changes hardly represent a complete overhaul, they are among the more significant at \u201cS. N. L. \u201d in recent years. Its 39th season, which concluded in the spring of 2014, was the last for the main cast members Seth Meyers (now the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night\u201d) and Nasim Pedrad, as well as several featured players. After its   season, the show said goodbye to Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis, while Kristen Wiig, Andy Samberg and Abby Elliott left after the   season. \u201cS. N. L. \u201d producers continue to spend the summer scouting for talent, and the show is expected to make new hires for the fall, though NBC gave no indication on Tuesday of who was being considered or how many cast members might join. The show still has a   impressionist for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, who has been played by Kate McKinnon, a star of this summer\u2019s \u201cGhostbusters\u201d reboot. (Meanwhile, Leslie Jones, Ms. McKinnon\u2019s \u201cS. N. L\u201d and \u201cGhostbusters\u201d   has also seen her status rise this summer, and has been added to NBC\u2019s coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics after following the Games in an unofficial capacity on her Twitter account.) In 2008 and 2012, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d broadcast additional episodes on Thursday nights, emphasizing political comedy, in the weeks before Election Day, though NBC has not announced similar plans for this year. Last season, Mr. Trump hosted \u201cS. N. L. \u201d on Nov. 7, 2015, while he was still vying for the Republican presidential nomination. Mrs. Clinton, while still contending for the Democratic nomination, appeared in a sketch with Ms. McKinnon on the Oct. 3, 2015, broadcast.'"}, "time": 1742563712.7653487}
