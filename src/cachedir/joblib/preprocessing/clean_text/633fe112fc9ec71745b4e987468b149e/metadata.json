In the coming week, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will fly to Hawaii for the express purpose of visiting the site of the surprise attack on a United States naval base 75 years ago that killed 2, 400 Americans and drew the country into World War II. It is a sign of how far public opinion in Japan has moved that Mr. Abe can make the trip to the memorial, accompanied by President Obama, to offer condolences to the victims. For decades, Japan has struggled to reckon with its wartime history, and the Pearl Harbor attack has been cast as a tragic but inevitable response to an   oil embargo that would have devastated the Japanese imperial empire. Because of domestic political opposition, it has been all but impossible for Japanese leaders to visit Pearl Harbor until now. In 1994, when Emperor Akihito tried to visit the memorial, atop the remains of the U. S. S. Arizona, the American battleship on which the worst losses occurred, protests from Japan\u2019s nationalist right wing prompted him to alter his plans. But after Mr. Abe, who is a conservative politician with strong ties to nationalist groups, announced his plans this month, the reception in Japan was largely positive. Even the   Sankei newspaper  \u2014   though grumbling that Mr. Abe should first revisit Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo where war criminals are enshrined  \u2014   described Mr. Abe\u2019s trip to Hawaii as \u201can opportunity to refresh a commitment to deepen the U. S.  friendship and contribute peace to the world through a tranquil ceremony. \u201d Some Japanese news media suggested that the Pearl Harbor trip could even lift  Mr. Abe\u2019s approval ratings and give him the confidence to call an election in January. The Japanese public is also aware of the importance of a symbolic visit to Pearl Harbor at a time of uncertainty in its country\u2019s relationship with the United States. Although the premier\u2019s visit to Pearl Harbor was in the planning stages even before the American presidential election, Donald J. Trump\u2019s win scared Japanese leaders because he had spent time on the campaign trail castigating Japan for not paying enough for its own defense. And when Mr. Obama made a visit to Hiroshima in May, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter: \u201cDoes President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he\u2019s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. \u201d Mr. Abe is not the first sitting prime minister to visit the Pearl Harbor memorial (Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida apparently visited the memorial during a stop in Hawaii in 1951) but he will be the first to participate in a public ceremony there. He is not expected to apologize for the attacks, much as Mr. Obama did not apologize for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Instead, Mr. Abe will most likely repeat the repentance and condolences he offered in April 2015 when he addressed Congress. Although it was 75 years in the making, Mr. Abe\u2019s trip to Pearl Harbor is in some ways the easiest gesture of reconciliation that Japan could make as it confronts its wartime past. Asia has long been plagued by an inability among the war\u2019s combatants to move beyond its events and enmities. South Korea and China remain angered by what they see as Japanese efforts to ignore or sugarcoat atrocities. By contrast, the relationship between Japan and the United States long ago overcame such difficulties. \u201cI think that\u2019s because the United States was a good winner and Japan was a good loser,\u201d said Tamaki Tsukada, a spokesman at the Japanese Embassy in Washington. \u201cThe United States was magnanimous after defeating Japan. It did not impose harsh terms. If anything, the U. S. provided very generous support, humanitarian and economic. \u201d The Japanese accepted the American postwar occupation peacefully. Even in the United States, where \u201cRemember Pearl Harbor\u201d was once a rallying cry, the sense of outrage about what was viewed as a sneaky and disreputable attack has largely dissipated, said Daniel Martinez, the chief historian at the Pearl Harbor memorial. Part of that is time, and also sympathetic popular culture portrayals of Japanese attackers in movies like \u201cTora! Tora! Tora!\u201d and \u201cPearl Harbor,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cI never hated the Japanese, and I don\u2019t need an apology,\u201d said Stu Hedley, 95, who was a seaman on the battleship West Virginia, which settled to the bottom of the harbor after the attack. \u201cI welcome this visit. \u201d In Japan, Pearl Harbor is often defined as one bookend of a war that ended with the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which some Japanese see as morally absolving the country of its aggression. Guidelines from the Ministry of Education for teaching history stipulate that students learn that \u201cJapan caused tremendous damage to many countries, especially in Asia, and that Japan also suffered unprecedented damages in the Tokyo air raids, the Battle of Okinawa and in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \u201d While most Japanese students visit Hiroshima or Nagasaki at least once during their school years, Pearl Harbor merits just one or two lines in most textbooks. \u201cThe younger generation knows the term Pearl Harbor, but they don\u2019t know much about it,\u201d said Katsutoshi Chujo, a middle school history teacher near Tokyo. \u201cMost young people don\u2019t know much about the war. They know about Japan as a victim in Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the Tokyo air raids. \u201d Several textbooks used in public schools describe it as a surprise attack on the United States that followed a long campaign in China. But a textbook that takes a more nationalist view and that has been approved by the Education Ministry portrays the attacks as being forced by American demands and describes Japan as waging a war of \u201c . \u201d Some historians worry that Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to Pearl Harbor will forestall broader atonement for Japan\u2019s wartime aggression in Asia. \u201cBy commemorating Pearl Harbor, if the whole society marginalizes the whole process that led to Pearl Harbor, that commemoration becomes an act of forgetting as well,\u201d said Yujin Yaguchi, a professor of American studies at the University of Tokyo. In the complex and highly choreographed world of war memory, scholars say, Mr. Abe\u2019s trip to Pearl Harbor is an important, if early, step. \u201cThere is a chronology to public memory,\u201d said Carol Gluck, a professor of history at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University. \u201cEverybody doesn\u2019t remember what they ought to remember in some abstract moral calculus. It\u2019s very political, and the domestic political calculus comes first. \u201d With some on the left in Japan calling for Mr. Abe to visit important war memorials in South Korea or China, analysts say political leaders need to build trust and share broader strategic goals before such symbolic gestures can take place. While Japan has a strong alliance with the United States, it does not share that kind of trust with China, and its relationship with South Korea is still shaky. \u201cThese visits don\u2019t cause reconciliation,\u201d said Jennifer Lind, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and the author of \u201cSorry States: Apologies in International Politics. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the exact opposite. Reconciliation causes these visits. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563202.4735818}
