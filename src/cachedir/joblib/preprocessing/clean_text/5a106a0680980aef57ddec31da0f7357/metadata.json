He was 27. Officer Jenny Houser of the Los Angeles Police Department said Mr. Yelchin was hit around 1:10 a. m. The car, an SUV, had rolled backward down a steep driveway and trapped him against a brick mailbox pillar and a security fence. Officer Houser said he was found dead by friends who had come to his house, in the Studio City neighborhood, after he did not show up for a rehearsal. (On Monday, The Associated Press reported that the vehicle, a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was one of 1. 1. million vehicles recalled by the manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler, in April because their gear shifters had confused drivers, causing the vehicles to roll away, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration records.) Mr. Yelchin was born on March 11, 1989, in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) Russia, in what was then the Soviet Union. His parents, Irina Korina and Viktor Yelchin, were superstar figure skaters with the Leningrad Ice Ballet. But the Yelchins, who are Jewish, fled the Soviet Union six months later, facing political and religious oppression and fearing for their son\u2019s safety. They settled in Los Angeles. His parents survive him. \u201cIt is a very bad situation over there,\u201d Viktor Yelchin told The Los Angeles Times. \u201cI would get angry, too  \u2014   I\u2019d say, \u2018Why should we have to buy things on the black market? Why should we have to stand in line? \u2019\u201d As a child actor, Anton made memorable appearances on television shows like \u201cER,\u201d \u201cThe Practice\u201d and \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm,\u201d on which he played a child magician who frustrates Larry David with a card trick. He also appeared in the films \u201cCharlie Bartlett\u201d (2007) with Robert Downey Jr. in which he played the title role, a talkative student who appoints himself his school\u2019s resident therapist, and \u201cAlpha Dog\u201d (2006) in which he played an innocent boy who becomes an unwitting pawn in a drug war. His breakthrough came in the director J. J. Abrams\u2019s 2009 resuscitation of \u201cStar Trek,\u201d the venerable   adventure franchise. Mr. Yelchin was cast as Pavel Chekov, the   Starfleet officer portrayed by Walter Koenig in the original \u201cStar Trek\u201d television series and movies. As played by Mr. Yelchin, Chekov was endearingly antic, humorously navigating his way through   scenarios and  \u2014   even in the 23rd century  \u2014   having difficulty with the \u201cV\u201d sounds in words like \u201cVictor\u201d and \u201cVulcan. \u201d Mr. Yelchin reprised the role in a 2013 sequel, \u201cStar Trek Into Darkness,\u201d and will be seen in a third film, \u201cStar Trek Beyond,\u201d to be released this summer. His other recent roles included the voice of Clumsy Smurf in two \u201cSmurfs\u201d movies and a member of a   band fighting its way out of a   skinhead club in the horror film \u201cGreen Room\u201d (2015). His   mourned his death on social media. In an Instagram post, Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock in the new \u201cStar Trek\u201d movies, wrote that Mr. Yelchin was \u201cone of the most open and intellectually curious people I have ever had the pleasure to know. \u201d In a post on Twitter, John Cho, who plays Sulu in the new movies, called Mr. Yelchin \u201ca true artist  \u2014   curious, beautiful, courageous. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563200.3302853}
