Mr. Trump made the remarks in an interview with The Sunday Times of London ahead of a referendum on the issue on Thursday and before his planned visit to Britain. \u201cI would personally be more inclined to leave, for a lot of reasons like having a lot less bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut I am not a British citizen. This is just my opinion. \u201d Mr. Trump has previously suggested that Britain \u201cshould leave,\u201d although he has offered only circumscribed thoughts about the issue, which is expected to affect global markets. Mr. Trump is expected to arrive in Scotland on Friday, a day after the vote, for a   at one of his newest golf clubs. It will be his first international trip since he became the presumptive Republican nominee. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who is urging Britons to vote to stay in the European Union, has been deeply critical of Mr. Trump, describing him as \u201cdivisive. \u201d The newly elected mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, the city\u2019s first Muslim mayor, has also criticized Mr. Trump for his proposed ban on Muslim immigrants entering the United States. In the Times of London interview, Mr. Trump declined to say anything about Mr. Khan other than wishing him luck. And he struck a magnanimous note about Mr. Cameron. \u201cI respect David Cameron,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know me, but I respect him. I respect what he has done and what he is doing, and I would imagine we will have a very good relationship if I am successful. \u201d Mr. Trump said he favored maintaining the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Britain and the United States that has existed for decades. But in a tweak at Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, Mr. Trump added, \u201cSometimes the special relationship hasn\u2019t worked out too well where they made a common mistake like Iraq. Frankly, they would have been a lot better off had they not become involved with Iraq. \u201d A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond on Sunday evening to an email seeking comment.'"}, "time": 1742562730.8582385}
