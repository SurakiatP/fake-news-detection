And we\u2019re not talking about a little, innocent smooch on the cheek, although that would be pretty weird as well, but a kiss on the lips. China Press reports that while the women were initially reluctant to accept the bizarre daily ritual, they eventually gave in to the boss\u2019 demands in order to keep their jobs. Only two of the company\u2019s female workers refused to kiss their boss on the mouth and chose to resign instead. According to Chinese media reports, over half the unnamed company\u2019s staff members are women. \\nFacing increasing pressure from both the media and the general public, the boss explained that he picked up the idea for the daily morning kiss while visiting a company in the United States, and claimed that the disgusting daily ceremony helps \u201cfoster good relationships among colleagues\u201d, allowing him and his female staff to get along \u201clike fish and water\u201d. Not only that, but he says that some of his women worker genuinely miss him when he is away, and send him messages on WeChat. \\nNeedless to say that the boss\u2019 explanation didn\u2019t really satisfy the millions of social media users outraged by the viral video of him kissing his female staff. \\n\u201cHow can these female workers accept this? Do their boyfriends or husbands know?\u201d one person commented on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. \u201cI want to ask these female workers: Do you have no money? Would you starve if you changed jobs?\u201d another added. \\nAnd while all of them condemned the man for his sleazy rule, some said that the women carried some of the blame as well, just for putting up with the situation. \u201cThe boss is a perv, but the workers are foolish,\u201d someone wrote.'"}, "time": 1742563140.7928274}
