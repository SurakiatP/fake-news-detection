This was his second encore. He asked for a capo, and someone hustled on stage to give him one. Then he played four acoustic killers  \u2014   a Bob Dylan cover, a Billy Joel cover and two of his own  \u2014   while, on either side of him, cameras were rolling, taking in the scene. Which is not to say that Mr. Brooks is a liar, per se  \u2014   only that he is an outstanding salesman, one of the greatest in pop music history, a man who vacillates seamlessly between the performance of intimacy and the performance of exuberance, and often does not distinguish between the two. That skill made him the signature country star of the 1990s, and also the decade\u2019s signature country disrupter. He infused the genre with classic rock gestures,   scale and pop ceremony long before doing so became the norm. And that made him staggeringly popular: The last time Mr. Brooks played New York City, it was to almost a million people in Central Park in 1997. This show in the Bronx was the first of two nights here, and the first country music concert at Yankee Stadium. And yet, Mr. Brooks was always a resolutely average singer. His greatest accomplishments were never technical or aesthetic, they were logistical  \u2014   he turned country songs into   community soundtracks. (As if to prove the point, Friday\u2019s show opened with a   video of the assembly of the stage, which was impressive, like a tiered cake with a huge circular loop that extended out into the center of the field.) He built the big tent under which country music now unthinkingly parades. He has done so with sleights of performance. Instead of singing with vibrato, he makes eye contact. Instead of vocal depth, he boasts a megawatt grin. Instead of flawless pitch, he has rugged athleticism. What he does have in common with more gifted vocalists, though, is his commitment to feeling. From that encore  \u2014   especially on the tender \u201cShe\u2019s Every Woman\u201d  \u2014   to \u201cThe Thunder Rolls\u201d to \u201cThe Dance,\u201d Mr. Brooks continually showed how to hush a room, even one with no roof. His wife, the country star Trisha Yearwood, joined him on the ballad \u201cIn Another\u2019s Eyes,\u201d then stuck around for three songs on her own  \u2014   an energetic cover of \u201cWhen Will I Be Loved? ,\u201d the peak schmaltz of \u201cHow Do I Live\u201d and the slightly tepid \u201cShe\u2019s in Love With the Boy\u201d  \u2014   before giving Mr. Brooks a lingering kiss on the mouth, then leaving. So it was a family affair, too, this Yankee Stadium party. That jovial attitude extended to Mr. Brooks\u2019s band and backup singers, perhaps the most excited and positive group of performers on any stage, anywhere. They smiled and laughed through \u201cAin\u2019t Goin\u2019 Down (\u2018Til the Sun Comes Up),\u201d \u201cTwo Pi\u00f1a Coladas\u201d and the rowdy \u201cPapa Loved Mama. \u201d Even when Mr. Brooks turned serious, for just a fleeting second, he turned the moment into an inclusive jam. Before singing the gimmicky \u201cPeople Loving People,\u201d he said he had been asked to comment on the shooting in Dallas that killed five police officers and injured seven more. He said his answer had always been the same: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to love one another  \u2014   that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s our only hope. \u201d In that same breath he mentioned Orlando, Fla. where a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub last month, and Paris, where 89 were killed at a concert last November. Mr. Brooks did not, however, mention the fatal police shootings of black men in Falcon Heights, Minn. and in Baton Rouge, La. And that omission only became more awkward when, later in the show, Mr. Brooks played the   joyful \u201cCallin\u2019 Baton Rouge,\u201d a song that felt out of step with the current political moment. Even though Mr. Brooks only recently made a public return to music after several years of semiretirement  \u2014   he said he will be releasing a new album in the fall  \u2014   he remains extremely popular. He recently announced a partnership with SiriusXM satellite radio, in which he will have a dedicated channel. And this show was being filmed, which was hard to overlook. Before Mr. Brooks took the stage, a functionary came out and   a blanket waiver. Another person said the number of cameras being used was 23. At one point during the show, Mr. Brooks ran around the circular stage twice, encouraging fans to do the wave. Afterward, breathing heavily, Mr. Brooks said that his producer was making \u201cthe old, fat guy\u201d do it once more. And so he did. At the end of the night, fireworks shot into the sky from behind the stage, but they were upstaged by the rain, which began during \u201cFriends in Low Places\u201d and really took hold during \u201cThe Dance,\u201d one of Mr. Brooks\u2019s most scarred ballads. It was so apt as to seem   it was studied sincerity and spontaneity all rolled into one. As Mr. Brooks sang, with eyes closed, about the trauma of failed love, raindrops were exploding at his feet.'"}, "time": 1742561730.889205}
