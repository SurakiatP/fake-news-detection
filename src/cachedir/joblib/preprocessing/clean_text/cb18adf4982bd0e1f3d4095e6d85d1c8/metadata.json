It marked the seventh auction he had attended in the last five years and, with a bid of $9, 000 an acre, his first win. \u201cI\u2019m just getting a really good start,\u201d said Mr. Kelchen, 51, who farms 2, 400 acres near Edgewood, Iowa. \u201cI plan to go as long as I possibly can. \u201d For farmers like Mr. Kelchen, whose work is a   lifestyle, retirement seems more like a sentence than a prize. \u201cThe first two days I\u2019d probably be all right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after that, I\u2019d be going haywire. \u201d Mark Francois, 64, a farmer who also bid on the farm, echoed that sentiment. \u201cI can only play so much golf,\u201d he said, seated beside his son. \u201cI don\u2019t look forward to retirement. I look forward to doing fieldwork. \u201d Even Dean Vaske, 52, the farmer whose late parents\u2019 land was being auctioned off, agreed. \u201cI\u2019m glad retirement is far away,\u201d he said. \u201cI love what I do, so why would I want to quit?\u201d Farmers tend to work longer than most Americans, and recent statistics show they are farming even later in life, driven by work that is their identity, aided by technology that lightens its physical toll, and spurred by solid profits off record yields. According to the Department of Agriculture\u2019s latest census, conducted in 2012, the average age of principal farm operators in the United States is 58, up from 50. 5 in 1982. One third are at least 65, the traditional retirement age, and 12 percent are 75 or older. Ask baby boomer farmers here how they are planning for retirement and the likely answer is: They are not. Fifteen percent of Iowa farmers never intend to retire, according to a 2014 farm poll by Iowa State University Extension and Outreach and the state agriculture department. Another 20 percent said they plan to eventually   continuing to provide some managerial control or labor to their farms. Many do not have a formal retirement fund. The land, they say, is their 401( k). The same fierce independence that drew them to farming characterizes their retirement approach: free of pensions, unions and   experts, just how they like it. \u201cWe\u2019re on our own,\u201d Mr. Francois said. \u201cAll you have to do is ask for advice, but we don\u2019t. \u201d Only 49 percent of Iowa farmers have identified a successor to eventually run their farms, according to the 2014 farm poll. Many avoid the topic because they equate retirement with mortality. They are quick to relay stories of farmers who died shortly after retiring  \u2014   presumably, they imply, because of a loss of purpose. Even those who have selected a successor are loath to pick a retirement date and actively prepare for it. It took a tornado for Dean Vaske\u2019s father, Art, to retire and move into town. He had been milking cows twice a day until his early 70s. Then the tornado wiped out another son\u2019s farm buildings, prompting Art to invite that son to move onto his farm. Looking back, Dean Vaske said, the transition was smooth. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have planned it much better,\u201d he said. Farmers here assume retirement will work itself out. \u201cIf everyone\u2019s raised right, the next generation will take care of us when we get to the point that we can\u2019t farm ourselves,\u201d said Jim Hogan, 66, a   farmer from Monticello, Iowa, whose father never retired. Mr. Hogan has two sons who farm with him and \u201cno idea\u201d how he will structure his retirement income when he scales back from daily operations. Yet he admits that his father\u2019s lack of succession planning (the farm was ultimately left in the control of Mr. Hogan\u2019s mother when his father died) was not ideal, limiting what Mr. Hogan and his brothers can now do with the land, which is still owned by his mother in a trust controlled by a law firm. David W. Baker, a farm transition specialist from Iowa State Extension and Outreach, said that when he counsels families to help them begin discussing retirement, 90 percent of his meetings bring someone to tears. \u201cThere are strong feelings about the farm, about what grandpa and grandma did, about my son or daughter having no interest in my farm,\u201d Mr. Baker said. Amanda Van Steenwyk, who leads a   program for the Iowa Farm Bureau, said the   scenario can be devastating. \u201cFrom the lack of planning, the farm will get split up  \u2014   or even worse, the family will get split up,\u201d she said. A farmer\u2019s retirement is determined by whether an adult child is involved in the operation. This is the case for 31 percent of Iowa farmers, according to the farm poll, which means they will typically sell or rent the land to their farming child upon retirement. Arriving at an equitable arrangement for the nonfarming children can be a challenge, experts say. Meanwhile, there is pressure on the child operating the family farm, said Matt Hein, 61, a Monticello farmer. \u201cYou\u2019re actually working with your father\u2019s retirement plan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou to go to bed at night thinking, \u2018That\u2019s a retirement plan. \u2019\u201d For Jack Kintzle, 73, a retired   farmer near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the fact that his children chose not to farm made him wistful at first, but ultimately simplified his retirement equation. \u201cIt helped me make a cleaner break,\u201d he said. Now Mr. Kintzle lives off his 700 acres. Some retired farmers   leasing their land and splitting the crop between owner and operator. Others set up a   lease in which another operator pays a fixed price per acre to work the land and keep all of its income. Last year\u2019s average rate was $235 per acre, according to Iowa State data. But farmers are in no rush, guided by a reversal of conventional wisdom on retirement. While many Americans fear they could work themselves to death, farmers see their livelihood as their lifeline. Success does not allow them to quit earlier, it prods them to keep going. And they don\u2019t envy retirees  \u2014   they feel sorry for them. \u201cIt\u2019s sad when people have a countdown to retirement,\u201d Mr. Francois said. \u201cThey obviously don\u2019t love their job. My friend who worked at the Postal Service had it right down to the hours till he could quit. Now he spends a lot of time just reading. He doesn\u2019t get outside as much. I don\u2019t think he even looks good. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562740.9989963}
