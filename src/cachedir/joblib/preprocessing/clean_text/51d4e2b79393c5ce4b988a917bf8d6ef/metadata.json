Peaceful attendees at MILO\u2019s previous shows have repeatedly been assaulted and verbally abused by   and \u201c \u201d protesters. On President Trump\u2019s inauguration day, MILO\u2019s show at the University of Washington was heavily affected after   and \u201c \u201d protesters turned up with baseball bats and sharpened sticks. Two police helicopters were called out to deal with the crowd, as well as a bomb squad and riot police, after numerous MILO fans were assaulted and faced violence. Prior to the show, a banner had been spotted near the event location in Seattle encouraging protesters to \u201cstab\u201d MILO on inauguration day. Earlier in January, MILO\u2019s show at UC Davis was forcibly cancelled after   protesters ripped down barricades, allegedly threw furniture at attendees, assaulted a reporter with hot coffee, spat on camera men, screamed at police officers who were protecting those inside, and attempted to destroy the equipment of those filming. An event in December was also cancelled following threats from Dakota Pipeline protesters, while several protesters were arrested at Michigan State University last year. At the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, MILO\u2019s video producer was attacked by communist protesters, while in May, two #BlackLivesMatter activists stormed MILO\u2019s stage and threatened him, with one protester throwing her fist near his face while screaming. Despite the rising level of violence committed by   protesters at MILO\u2019s events, \u201c \u201d have repeatedly encouraged protesters to disrupt his shows in any way possible.
