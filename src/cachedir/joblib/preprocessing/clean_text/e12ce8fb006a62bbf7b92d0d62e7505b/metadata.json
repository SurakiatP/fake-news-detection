The wearer was Charlotte Bront\u00eb, and her demure day dress, just about big enough for a    girl, was the plain wrapping that encased an enormous talent, a bubbling blend of ambition, passion and literary genius. Like a disembodied spirit, the dress stands at the entrance to \u201cCharlotte Bront\u00eb: An Independent Will,\u201d which opens at the Morgan Library  Museum on Friday and runs through Jan. 2. Timed to the 200th anniversary of Bront\u00eb\u2019s birth, the exhibition offers a compact, sensitively arranged and surprisingly comprehensive tour of the life and work of one of the Victorian era\u2019s most beloved writers, an object of fascination from the moment that \u201cJane Eyre\u201d was published under the pen name Currer Bell in 1847. The exhibition\u2019s subtitle comes from the pivotal chapter in \u201cJane Eyre\u201d in which the heroine, although deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, the master of the house where she is a governess, spurns his proposal that she live with him, in effect, as his mistress. He entreats her to stop struggling like a \u201cwild frantic bird. \u201d She replies: \u201cI am no bird and no net ensnares me. I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you. \u201d The passage  \u2014   one of the sizzlers that made \u201cJane Eyre\u201d an   in its time  \u2014   may be read in the novel\u2019s bound manuscript, on view for the first time in the United States, and opened to the relevant page. Christine Nelson, a Morgan curator, secured the loan from the British Library and, to complement the Morgan\u2019s deep holdings of Bront\u00eb manuscripts, books and drawings, arranged to borrow other items from the National Portrait Gallery in London and the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum in Haworth, Yorkshire. The exhibition, tracing a fluid, chronological circle, begins by establishing the location. For nearly all her life, Charlotte lived in a modest parsonage in Haworth, northwest of the urban and industrial Bradford and Leeds, perched on the edge of a wild moor. In the hands of the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell, whose enormously popular biography \u201cThe Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u201d appeared in 1857, two years after its subject\u2019s death at the age of 38, the village, the house and its inhabitants took on a gothic character that haunted the public imagination. High on a windswept hill, wrapped in darkness and incessant rain, lived a family of creative geniuses, with three little Wednesday Addamses  \u2014   Charlotte, Emily and Anne  \u2014   afloat in a literary fantasy world. Two souvenir postcards in the exhibition ratify the general impression: a stern photograph of the parsonage, with gravestones in the foreground, and a truly frightening ambrotype showing the house as a blackened, solitary form with eerily glowing windows. It cries out for an exorcism. Haworth was actually a busy village with 11 grocery stores and six pubs, one of them a few steps from the parsonage. And the three sisters, along with their brother, Branwell, made this humble dwelling a factory of fun, despite the death of their mother and two older sisters. From an early age, the precocious siblings churned out fantasy fiction set in Glass Town, Angria and Gondal, magical imaginary lands populated by aristocrats, poets and lovers aflame. The current of romance ran strong in Haworth Parsonage, where Byron and Scott were gods. Along the walls devoted to \u201cImagination,\u201d Chapter 2 in the exhibition\u2019s story, the Bront\u00eb juvenilia unfolds, remarkable in both form and content. Charlotte mastered a nearly microscopic handwriting, with the appearance of printed fonts, to give her   publications the look of a finished book or magazine. The Young Men\u2019s Magazine, a pretend journal in the style of Blackwood\u2019s, measures an inch and a half by just over two inches, yet it contains a table of contents, articles and fake advertisements. Magnifying glasses have been provided, and they are needed. The print was small, but the ambition was titanic. Charlotte, bowing to the prejudices of the day, often presented herself as a kind of country mouse, nothing more than the daughter of a humble clergyman. It was, in large part, a pose. Ms. Nelson has come up with telling bits of counterevidence. Charlotte\u2019s 1830 pencil portrait of Zenobia Marchioness Ellrington, one of her Glass Town characters, is accompanied by a pungent quote, reproduced on a wall of the exhibition. When Zenobia, a formidable intellect with similarities to her creator and to Jane Eyre, attracts the sniping criticism of a circle of males, the beguiling Marquess of Douro rises to her defense. \u201cYou are certainly jealous because a member of the feminine gender has displayed such wonderful abilities,\u201d he begins, and goes on to praise a genius \u201clikely to pale the ineffectual fires of her male contemporaries. \u201d The childhood world of fantasy takes a somber turn at the exhibition\u2019s wailing wall. As the sisters entered their late teens, they faced painfully limited prospects as daughters of a humble clergyman. The world of work beckoned, and for single women of their class, that meant one of two professions, teacher or governess, neither of which they were suited to by talent or temperament. The saddest document in the exhibition is a prospectus that the sisters drew up advertising a school that they hoped to run: \u201cthe Misses Bront\u00eb\u2019s establishment for the Board and Education of a limited number of young ladies. \u201d The number was very limited: zero. Just a few years before this low point, Branwell, an aspiring artist, painted a group portrait of the four siblings, one of the focal points of the exhibition. It is a strange visual document. At some point, Branwell painted over his likeness, leaving a whitish pillar between himself and his sisters, almost as though he had beamed himself out of the family, \u201cStar Trek\u201d style. In a sense, he did. His life ended, at 31, in a suicidal spiral of alcohol and opium addiction. Tuberculosis would claim Emily at 30, soon after \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d appeared, and Anne at 29. For more than a   the portrait sat, folded in four and deeply creased, on top of a wardrobe in the home of Arthur Bell Nicholls, the curate at Haworth whom Charlotte married nine months before her death. It was discovered in 1916 by his second wife. It now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery and, like the British Library\u2019s \u201cJane Eyre\u201d manuscript, rarely leaves. \u201cIt was quite extraordinary to secure these,\u201d Ms. Nelson said in an interview this week. \u201cThese are pilgrimage pieces. People come to the National Portrait Gallery seeking out that portrait in particular. \u201d Branwell lacked talent, sad to say, and his depiction of Charlotte gives little or no sense of what she looked like. The only other known portrait of her, by George Richmond, also on loan from the National Portrait Gallery, is a polite, decorous effort. Richmond was commissioned by Charlotte\u2019s editor, George Smith, to produce a flattering image of his subject, and he obliged. Posterity has been left with a hopeless quest for an image to match the vividness of the literary personality. After the misery of servitude, the exhibition follows the path to glory, the years when Charlotte leapt immediately to the front rank of Victorian fiction with \u201cJane Eyre. \u201d She managed two more novels in her short lifetime, \u201cVillette\u201d and \u201cShirley,\u201d which stand guard, along with her posthumously published early effort, \u201cThe Professor,\u201d behind the \u201cJane Eyre\u201d manuscript. The rest is history, of a peculiar sort. Admiration turned to worship within a few years after Charlotte died, three weeks before her 39th birthday and pregnant with her first child, her votive flame fanned into a blaze by Gaskell\u2019s book. Readers of the life and the novels began making their way to Haworth, eager to see the famous moors and behold the parsonage. The exhibition includes an 1858 letter from Patrick Bront\u00eb, Charlotte\u2019s father, with a   snippet cut from one of Charlotte\u2019s letters, in response to an American admirer seeking a sample of Charlotte\u2019s handwriting. The trickle of pilgrims  \u2014   perhaps 200 a year in the 1860s  \u2014   became a flood after the opening of the Bront\u00eb museum in a few rooms over the Yorkshire Penny Bank in 1895. Today, little Haworth attracts a million or so visitors a year, at least some of them headed for the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum, which opened in 1928, replacing the first museum. The fever still rages. At the parsonage museum, the exhibition \u201cCharlotte Great and Small\u201d runs through Jan. 1, and an exhibition in London at the National Portrait Gallery, \u201cCelebrating Charlotte Bront\u00eb: \u201d ended its run last month. \u201cTo Walk Invisible,\u201d a period drama about the Bront\u00ebs written and directed by Sally Wainwright (\u201cHappy Valley\u201d and \u201cLast Tango in Halifax\u201d) is scheduled for broadcast on the BBC later this year. \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d one if its early reviewers wrote, was a novel \u201cto make the pulses gallop and heart beat. \u201d The same could be said for its author. And here is the evidence, undeniable and irresistible.'"}, "time": 1742562054.7889702}
