[VentureBeat reports that following rumors for the past six weeks relating to the implementation of a native   within Google Chrome, the company has finally stepped forward to set the record straight. Google has joined the Coalition for Better Ads, a group that sets specific standards in order to improve ads for consumers. Chrome will reportedly begin to block all ads that do not meet the Coalition\u2019s guidelines, \u201cstarting in early 2018. \u201d  In practical terms, Google will use the Chrome browser to cut off advertising revenue to sites that don\u2019t meet their standards. The browser will be taking a hardline stance towards websites  \u2014   if one of their ads doesn\u2019t meet guidelines then all ads will be blocked, resulting in a total loss of revenue. It seems that Google\u2019s hope with this integrated   is to make third party extensions redundant. Many   ad blockers block all  outright, while Google\u2019s new blocker will only filter poorly optimized ads that they claim hurt publishers \u201cand threatens the sustainability of the web ecosystem. \u201d Despite the fact that Google actually makes the majority of their revenue from  the company says that they see this type of selective ad blocker as the future of internet browsing and natural evolution of ad blockers.
