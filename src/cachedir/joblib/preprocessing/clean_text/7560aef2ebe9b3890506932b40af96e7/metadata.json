Police have protesters more or less surrounded. #noDAPL pic.twitter.com/G4xGQuXpZM \\n\u2014 Jason Patinkin (@JasonPatinkin) October 27, 2016 \\nThe police reportedly arrested at least 141 Native Americans and other demonstrators who are seeking to halt construction of a controversial oil pipeline. \\nPress TV reports \\nAt least 141 protesters were arrested on Thursday evening and Friday morning as officers attempt to clear a camp on private property in the path of the proposed $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline, the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a statement. \\nOfficers in riot helmets used pepper spray and shot beanbag rounds on some of the estimated 330 protesters as helicopters flew overhead. \\nDemonstrators also allegedly set a car and some tires on fire, giving the scene a war zone-like appearance. \\nThe protesters have been demonstrating for several months, and dozens have been arrested. Police expect additional protests, and possibly more arrests, in the coming days. \\nNative American protesters had occupied the property that crosses the pipeline\u2019s path since Monday in an effort to stop Energy Transfer Partners\u2019 construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. \\nThe pipeline has infuriated the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and environmental activists who say it threatens the region\u2019s water supply and sacred tribal sites. The tribe\u2019s reservation is close to the pipeline\u2019s route. \\nNorth Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said police were successful in clearing the camp. \u201cPrivate property is not the place to carry out a peaceful protest,\u201d he said. \\nDemonstrators, however, say they aren\u2019t trespassing on private property, citing an 1851 treaty with the US government that says the land belongs to Native American tribes. \\nThe Native American-led protest has grown into a larger movement in the United States, drawing in other tribes, environmentalists and advocates for Native Americans. \\nThe federal government has twice asked the pipeline operator to voluntarily pause construction near the tribe\u2019s reservation while the authorities reconsider the project\u2019s route. But courts have refused to compel a halt. \\nThe chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe criticized law enforcement\u2019s \u201cmilitarized\u201d response to the activists. \u201cMilitarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today. We continue to pray for peace,\u201d Dave Archambault II said in a statement Thursday evening.'"}, "time": 1742628372.5227628}
