[The Liverpudlian MEP described how, in the past, the police and MI5 had \u201cfoiled plot after plot in the nick of time\u201d but are now \u201cbeing overwhelmed by the impossible scale\u201d of the problem.  He criticised an establishment which has been complacent in allowing Islamists to \u201cset up home in Britain\u201d since the 1980s, on the mistaken assumption that they would not attack the country which had given them shelter. Nuttall also singled out particular actions undertaken by Theresa May in her former role as Home Secretary for denunciation, such as the massive police cuts carried out at the behest of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Geroge Osborne, and the abolition of control orders in favour of weaker TPims at the behest of former Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg.

Nuttall also pledged to tackle the \u201crampant radicalisation within our prisons\u201d by reversing cuts to prison funding and officer numbers, and to train 4, 000 new border guards to \u201cproperly control our borders\u201d  \u2014   which experts now believe to be \u201cporous\u201d particularly along the coast. Asked how he would fund these changes, along with a \u201cmajor increase in resources for MI5\u201d the UKIP leader pointed to \u00a335 billion in savings identified in his party\u2019s manifesto, mainly from reducing the ballooning foreign aid budget, cutting the controversial High Speed Rail 2 project, and changing the Barnett formula  \u2014   described as a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d by its late creator  \u2014   which sees Scotland receive higher levels of funding than elsewhere in Britain. Armed with a baton, our brave officer faced the London Bridge attackers. We\u2019re extremely proud of him and every single emergency responder. https:  .   \u2014   BTP (@BTP) June 4, 2017,  Nuttall also called for a national debate on whether or not we should \u201croutinely arm our police\u201d after a British Transport Police officer was forced to take on the three London Bridge attackers with an extendable baton, leaving him hospitalised and in a very serious condition. Nuttall suggested the time has come to accept we now live in different times and pointed out that in Brussels and Strasbourg, where his work as an MEP takes him regularly, armed police are a commonplace sight.

He said he would \u201cmake no apologies for taking nothing off the table to ensure our people are kept safe\u201d. However, he stopped short of joining Colonel Kemp in calling for foreign nationals on the terror watch list to be deported or interned, and ruled out following U. S. President Donald Trump\u2019s lead in attempting to impose restrictions on travel to and from failed states such as Libya and Syria, which have become major hotbeds of Islamic radicalism. That\u2019s right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won\u2019t help us protect our people!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017,  In terms of the growth of radical extremism at home, Nuttall said \u201cwe must demand more from the Muslim community itself,\u201d referencing statistics which suggest that \u201conly one in eight referrals to Prevent\u201d  \u2014   the government\u2019s   programme  \u2014   \u201ccome from the Muslim community itself\u201d. He also accused the Labour Party of being \u201cculpable\u201d in thwarting efforts to counter extremism by opposing Prevent, singling out Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham for his opposition to the programme in particular. The UKIP leader also demanded the Government \u201cclose down mosques where extreme Wahhabi or Salafist versions of Islam are preached\u201d and to bar the funding of religious institutions in Britain by Saudi Arabia and Qatar the latter of which was recently isolated by key Arab nations for its alleged support for overseas extremism. Nuttall also urged officials to release the findings of an investigation into Saudi funding of British religious institutions in particular, which are reportedly being suppressed.

S. allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar supported ISIS https:  .   \u2014   Salon (@Salon) October 12, 2016,  Finally, Nuttall acknowledged that Theresa May had been \u201ccomplacent at best\u201d as home secretary, but said that the dangers posed by the Tories \u201cpales into insignificance\u201d beside the prospect of a Labour Government in which Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott would be responsible for national security. Corbyn, he alleged, had \u201cgone out of [his] way to befriend terror groups both in Northern Ireland and the Middle East\u201d throughout his political career. With only a few exceptions, including Kate Hoey, Kelvin Hopkins, and Frank Field, Labour candidates \u201ccannot be trusted on Brexit and cannot be trusted on national security\u201d he said. He advised voters to bear this in mind when considering who to vote for in constituencies where a UKIP candidate is not standing  \u2014   but told journalists that this sort of \u201ctactical voting\u201d strategy was a   for this particular election.'"}, "time": 1742562589.0712736}
