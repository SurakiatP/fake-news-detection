After an election in which facts could be oh so elusive, it\u2019s instructive to look back to 2003. That\u2019s when several \u201cDaily Show\u201d staff members heard a speech from President George W. Bush that directly contradicted things the presidential candidate George W. Bush had said about foreign policy. It dawned on them to pull old tape and set up a mock debate in a split screen: Bush versus Bush. It was a breakthrough for Jon Stewart\u2019s show. \u201cIf we, as basically stoner comedy people, could remember it, how was it possible that the actual media couldn\u2019t remember it, or didn\u2019t care, or didn\u2019t think it was important?\u201d Ben Karlin, a former producer of the show, says. That\u2019s one valuable anecdote in this exhaustive oral history, which traces the   sprint that turned \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d from a   cable presentation into a vital institution in American politics and the media. The book, compiled by the New York magazine contributing editor Chris Smith, rides through moments of history like the 2000 recount, Sept. 11, the 2004 election and the Obama years, explaining how all of it altered and refined \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d with Stewart at the helm. As in other   show tales, the best stories here involve contract talks. And the book breaks plenty of news. It reveals that in 2012, negotiations for Stewart and Stephen Colbert  \u2014   whose show \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d followed \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Comedy Central  \u2014   became so tense, both stars temporarily quit. The appointed villain is Philippe Dauman, former chairman of Comedy Central\u2019s parent company, Viacom. Colbert was ready to stay through the 2016 election, but Dauman refused. (That worked out well for Colbert, who in 2014 was hired to replace David Letterman on CBS. \u201cThank God they said no,\u201d he says.) Stewart also blames Viacom for botching the chance to sign John Oliver as his replacement before Oliver left for his successful HBO show. But delicious stories like these  \u2014   the lifeblood of any oral history  \u2014   can also be fleeting. When the journalists James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales paired up to compile oral histories of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and ESPN, there were tales of sex and drugs. But \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d was a different animal. \u201cThe drug stories are pretty lame,\u201d Elliott Kalan, a writer on the show, tells Smith. \u201cThe sex stories are pretty lame. \u201d The \u201cDaily Show\u201d staff was, instead, mostly  . There are allusions to unhappiness in the writers\u2019 room because of Stewart\u2019s autocratic rule, with one producer saying \u201cplenty of people\u201d would describe Stewart as a tyrant. But the producer in question wasn\u2019t one of them, and only rarely does any actual bitterness spill onto the page. Instead, there\u2019s space dedicated to grindingly banal details like how morning and afternoon meetings were crucial to the show\u2019s success. One producer is quoted discussing the pride she took in organizing a staff clambake and wine tasting. The book\u2019s tone can be a bit   too. After \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d wins one of its first Emmy Awards, Smith writes that despite their commercial and critical success, \u201cStewart and the staff, to a remarkable degree, stayed focused on the task of creating 160 or so shows each year. \u201d Still, the book is a valuable reminder of the show\u2019s role in introducing an era of     in American politics. Producers recount seeing a politician lie on CNN, only to have the reporter respond, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to leave it there\u201d  \u2014   a   occurrence. \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d ran a segment holding both the politician and the network accountable. \u201cI think Jon\u2019s joke was, \u2018Don\u2019t leave it there. There is a terrible place to leave it! \u2019\u2019u200a\u201d the producer Ramin Hedayati tells Smith. \u201cNow when something crazy happens on CNN, there are five blogs that flag it. Back then, it was either us or no one. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564267.526872}
