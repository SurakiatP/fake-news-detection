Citing ethical reasons, the toy manufacturer said they would continue to make Star Wars-themed Death Stars but had declined to Donald Trump\u2019s request for a \u2018full-sized\u2019 one. \\nDespite being the nemesis of bare feet everywhere, Lego were keen to distance themselves from any negative publicity \u2013 withdrawing from plans for a Lego Boko Haram \u2018Adventure Playground\u2019, Lego Kim Jong-Un with Missile Launcher and Lego Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys \u2018House of Fun\u2019. Instead their focus will be on a \u2018Brexit Box of Bricks'; which lacks any plan and, despite promises on the packaging, can not be used to build any hospitals whatsoever. \\nLego\u2019s rejection leaves Mr. Trump no choice but to assemble his 2,000 mile wall out of pulped copies of the Koran; held together with \u2018whatever the hell\u2019 he uses as hair glue. Sadly Mexico had already agreed to pay for the construction costs, but, like most parents this Christmas, had balked at the material cost of using Lego. \\nMeanwhile The Daily Mail will no longer give away toys but will continue to dispense fear for free. Likewise Mr. Trump has said he will keep his election promises without Lego; replacing Obamacare with \u2018Doc McStuffins\u2019, waterboarding with \u2018Super Soakers\u2019 and any non-compliant women with \u2018Barbie\u2019\u2013 or Ivana as she is known.
