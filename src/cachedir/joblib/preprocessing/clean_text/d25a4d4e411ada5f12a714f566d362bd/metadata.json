Speaking at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on October 15th, he raised a hand as if to take an oath and declared : \u201cI am a victim!\u201d The great business tycoon, the one and only man who could fix America and make the place great again (trust me, folks), was laying claim to martyrdom \u2014 and spinning another news cycle. \u201cI am a victim,\u201d he declared, \u201cof one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country. They are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them the greatest movement in the history of our country.\u201d \\n\u201cI am a victim.\u201d That pathetic line echoed in my head, which is why I\u2019m writing this. In my long life, I had seen a large white man stand up in a public arena and proclaim those words \u2014 the shrill, self-pitying complaint of the remorseless perpetrator \u2014 only once before. That was in a courtroom in lower Manhattan in 1988. The man was Joel Steinberg , a New York lawyer who, over a 12-year period, had brainwashed and beaten into oblivion a woman named Hedda Nussbaum, once a successful young editor of children\u2019s books. In the early years of their relationship, she had run away several times, seeking help, and every time a doctor or friend had called Steinberg to come and get her. At that point \u2014 time and again \u2014 Steinberg would administer \u201cpunishment,\u201d breaking her bones and her spirit. She took on what police would later describe as \u201ca zombie-like quality.\u201d \\nSome years earlier, a teenage girl had hired Steinberg to arrange an adoptive home for her baby. Instead he kept the child, Lisa, until one evening when she was six years old and \u201cstared\u201d at him in a way he didn\u2019t like. He responded by striking her repeatedly in the head. After which he went out to dinner with his cocaine dealer, leaving the child unconscious on the floor. Nussbaum, by then so traumatized, so absent from anything like life, thought vaguely of calling a doctor, but she was not allowed to use the phone in Steinberg\u2019s absence. Instead, she sat on the floor and watched over the girl as she lay dying. \\nOn trial for the child\u2019s murder, Steinberg blamed everyone but himself. \u201cI\u2019m the victim here,\u201d he whined in court. He swore that he had \u201cnever hit anyone,\u201d not anyone , even though he was known to have assaulted a business associate and three other women before he settled into the single-minded, single-handed demolition of Hedda Nussbaum. \\nJudge Harold Rothwax observed that Steinberg was \u201ca man of extraordinary narcissism and self-involvement\u201d who had \u201can extreme need to control everyone in his ambit\u201d while he lived a \u201clife of self-gratification.\u201d Yet Steinberg could not see in himself the man Judge Rothwax described. He thought people should feel sorry for him. He had been disbarred and had lost a child (not to mention his Greenwich Village apartment). He railed at those who had conspired to bring him down: the police, the neighbors, the judge, the prosecutor, the expert medical witnesses, his defense attorney, the jurors, the press, and Hedda Nussbaum. \u201cI\u2019m the victim here,\u201d he claimed. \\nAt the time, nearly 30 years ago, the public blamed Hedda Nussbaum. The district attorney, the police, the doctors and psychiatrists who treated her intensively for more than a year before the trial all agreed that, on the evening in question, she was too physically and mentally \u201cincapacitated\u201d either to cause the girl\u2019s injuries or take action to save her. Nonetheless, she was tried and condemned by the press and public opinion, including women who called themselves \u201cfeminists.\u201d In court, the jurors were merciless. When they began to deliberate, only four thought Steinberg guilty of murder as charged, five were \u201cin the middle,\u201d and three held out for lesser charges, feeling certain that Hedda Nussbaum had somehow been responsible for killing the child. \\nThey finally agreed upon a verdict of manslaughter. Even then, a woman juror assured the press that Nussbaum was \u201ca very sick woman\u201d who should have been charged and convicted of \u201csome crime.\u201d Another juror, also female, expressed popular opinion this way: \u201cI just feel that she was to blame.\u201d And a third woman juror, who claimed that \u201ccertain others\u201d agreed with her, said, \u201cPoor Joel. Joel\u2019s a victim. We have to send a message to the system: \u2018You don\u2019t make victims out of nice men like Joel.\u2019\u201d \\nJudge Rothwax sentenced Steinberg to eight and a half to 25 years. Released after 17 years, Steinberg, now in his seventies, still claims to have done nothing hurtful to anyone. He has not paid a civil court-ordered settlement of $15 million to the birth mother of the dead child, nor has he ever been charged with any crime for what he did to Hedda Nussbaum. \\nTwo lessons lurk in this story, one old and one very up to date. First, it\u2019s a reminder of how much women at that time, even after a great wave of feminism, still blamed women (including themselves) for whatever happened to them at the hands of men; second, a man with a character like Steinberg\u2019s is not the kind of guy you want to choose for high office \u2014 or any office at all. \\nJoel Steinberg stalked a far tinier stage than Donald Trump and he did more deadly damage, but the two men seem to be brothers under the skin, sharing common character defects well described in psychiatric texts: extreme narcissism, a taste for sexual predation, and very similar views of the women on whom they prey. Like Steinberg, who was incapable of seeing himself as the judge accurately described him, Trump seems blind to the real nature of his own behavior. (His current wife describes him as a \u201cboy.\u201d) Neither man seems capable of taking responsibility for the harm he\u2019s done, and when their own actions finally call down retribution, branding them as losers \u2014 ah, then come the conspiracy theories and the vindictive wail of the victim. \\nMen Who Use Women \\nLast June, I published a piece at TomDispatch venturing to explain why candidate Donald J. Trump was getting \u201crock-bottom ratings\u201d in the polls from women voters. Nearly 70% of them reportedly couldn\u2019t stand the guy. I pointed out what seemed to me to be the obvious: \u201cTrump\u2019s behavior perfectly fits the profile of an ordinary wife abuser.\u201d \\nIn a sworn deposition introduced in divorce proceedings , his first wife Ivana swore under oath that he had torn out her hair and forcibly raped her, raging at her because he didn\u2019t like the results of a \u201cscalp-reducing\u201d procedure (meant to remove a bald patch) performed on him by a plastic surgeon she had recommended. (Before she collected a $14 million divorce settlement, she toned her story down, saying the assault was not \u201ccriminal.\u201d) \\nAbout one in three American women are survivors of some version of such treatment, euphemistically called \u201c domestic abuse .\u201d That\u2019s roughly 65 million women voters who, as I wrote last June, \u201cknow a tyrant when they see one.\u201d I raise this subject again because the now-infamous tape of Trump\u2019s open-mic Hollywood Access bus ride in 2005 added a new page to the rap sheet of this particular abuser. \\nIn that piece of mine, I traced the history of the principal tactics of coercion used by controlling men like Trump. Some of those tactics, including Steinberg\u2019s favorites, involve physical force, but most, when used by a skilled abuser, require no force at all. Trump applies the handiest tools to his targeted victims regularly, leaving no physical marks behind: threats, intimidation, degradation, put-downs, humiliation, insults, trivial demands, occasional indulgences (a flash of charm, for example, or a bit of feigned reasonableness). The lesson is simple and clear: the mind can be bent and the spirit shattered without battering the body. \\nI neglected, however, to mention one of the most insidious tactics of such abusers, perhaps because it\u2019s so obvious that it regularly hides in plain sight. In the military, it\u2019s called \u201cpulling rank.\u201d High status is itself a powerful coercive force that can stifle resistance in a lower-status victim and so silence him or her. Status is Trump\u2019s brandished weapon, his open carry. On this, he couldn\u2019t have been clearer in boasting of his pussy-grabbing skills on that Hollywood Access tape : \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d \\nThe most chilling moments on that tape, however, occur after Trump emerges from the bus in all his orange splendor, followed by his escort Billy Bush \u2014 now a former NBC \u201cpersonality\u201d \u2014 who could be heard on that tape laughing as Trump recounted his compulsive assaults. Bush then greeted his television colleague Arianne Zucker, who like so many women on American TV was less fully clothed than the men around her, and whom Trump had been ogling from the bus while sucking Tic Tacs to freshen his potty mouth for a possible kissing attack. Billy Bush \u201casked\u201d Ms. Zucker, \u201cHow about a little hug for The Donald?\u201d \\nIn that short bus trip across the parking lot, Bush had learned just what to do to get in good stead with his high-status guest, and so, without missing a beat, he threw his lower status co-worker to his peppermint-salivating pal. He then collected a hug from her, too, as Trump is heard exonerating himself with the bizarre remark, \u201cMelania said this was okay.\u201d \\nIt hardly seemed to matter what Arianne Zucker wanted or believed to be okay. Billy Bush\u2019s question wasn\u2019t actually a question, but a notice of what was expected. Clearly, she wanted to keep her job and, just as clearly, hugging predatory, high-status stars and coworkers had never been part of her job description, but was a little instant add-on of coercion from her colleague.Setting the star power aside, all of this amounts to commonplace harassment in what appears to be a hostile workplace , and it just happens to be against the law. \\nOne in three women between the ages of 18 and 24 say that they have been harassed at work . Yet 70% of all workers (woman and men) harassed on the job do not report the offense, often for fear of disbelief or reprisal. Think of all the women in television who were subjected to harassment and worse by Roger Ailes \u2014 the charges now reach back 50 years \u2014 fired at last by Fox News, only to become official media adviser to whom else but presidential candidate Donald Trump. \\nSome in the media glossed over Trump\u2019s bragging as just so much \u201c lewd conversation \u201d \u2014 or as Trump himself put it \u201c locker room talk \u201d\u2014 while his wife Melania dismissed it as \u201c boy talk .\u201d In fact, Trump\u2019s unwanted kissing and groping \u2014 his self-described M.O. substantiated by one victim after another \u2014 can be classified in his home state (under New York Penal Law, Article 130 , Section 130.52: forcible touching) as a Class A misdemeanor. That may not sound serious, but it\u2019s punishable by a maximum fine of $1,000 (chump change for The Donald) and a more sobering potential year behind bars. \\nIt was that tape, all over the media on October 7th, that prompted Anderson Cooper during the second presidential debate to ask Trump three times if he had actually done the sort of things he described to Billy Bush, which Cooper correctly named \u201csexual assault.\u201d Trump finally answered: \u201cAnd I will tell you, no I have not\u201d \u2014 and women who had lived for five, 10, 20, even 30 years with nagging memories of a Trump assault and humiliation had to restrain an immediate impulse to smash the TV set and instead called a news outlet or a lawyer. \\nAs of this writing, more than a dozen women have gone public with reports of Trump\u2019s sexual attacks since the release of that Hollywood Access tape. They join a list of women and girls who had previously reported offenses ranging from outright sexual assault to crashing dressing rooms at beauty contests where nude and semi-nude women and girls were preparing to compete for the titles of Miss Universe or Miss Teen America. That brings the number of Trump\u2019s accusers , as I write, to at least 24. Journalists and lawyers have generally managed to verify their accounts. \\nOf course, Trump has repeatedly denied the women\u2019s allegations, saying before, during, and ever since the third presidential debate that he had never seen those women before, had no idea who they were, found them insufficiently attractive to warrant his attention, and that their stories had, in any case, been debunked . None of his claims were true. (And, for good measure, he announced during his version of a Gettysburg Address that he would sue every one of them after the election was over.) \\nIn my June post, I wrote: \\n\u201cTrump\u2019s behavior perfectly fits the profile of an ordinary wife abuser \u2014 but with one additional twist\u2026 Trump has not confined his controlling tactics to his own home(s). For seven years, he practiced such tactics openly for all the world to see on The Apprentice , his very own reality show, and now applies them on a national stage, commanding constant attention while alternately insulting, cajoling, demeaning, embracing, patronizing, and verbally beating up anyone\u2026 who stands in the way of his coronation.\u201d \\nIn this fashion, he humiliated his male Republican primary opponents, demeaning them with nicknames \u2014 Little Marco, Lyin\u2019 Ted, Low-Energy Jeb \u2014 and denigrated his only female primary opponent, Carly Fiorina, by unfavorably appraising her appearance. (\u201cLook at that face! Would anyone vote for that?\u201d) More recently, of course, he\u2019s disparaged \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d in a similar fashion . (\u201cSuch a nasty woman!\u201d) \\nGrowing Up in America \\nHillary Clinton, as Trump himself has acknowledged, is a fighter who will not quit \u2014 unperturbed even by his stalking her on stage throughout the second presidential debate and body-shaming her afterwards. \u201cShe walked in front of me,\u201d he said of a moment in that debate when she crossed the stage to speak to a questioner in the audience. \u201cBelieve me, I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201d In the third debate, she called him out directly on his behavior. \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like.\u201d \\nHere was something new under the sun: a woman on a presidential debate stage calling out an insufferable man \u2014 a serial predator, at that \u2014 on behavior so common among men for so long that the vast majority of women in this country have experienced it and learned to call it \u201clife.\u201d \\nSome women still see it that way. The New York Times , for instance, interviewed a 62-year-old woman voting for Trump who said that other women offended by his \u201cbanter\u201d should \u201c grow up .\u201d I like to think that hers is a good description of what\u2019s happening nationally at the moment, though obviously not in the fashion that she imagined. After all, grown-up women led the way, among congressional representatives, in calling Trump out. Republican Congresswomen Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Martha Roby of Alabama both asked him to withdraw from the race. Kay Granger of Texas, Mia Love of Utah, and Ann Wagner of Missouri said they could not vote for him. Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia withdrew their support. Susana Martinez, Republican governor of New Mexico, said she would not support Trump, while former Republican presidential candidate Fiorina said that Trump should step aside. Republican former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice wrote on her Facebook page: \u201cEnough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw.\u201d \\nStill, don\u2019t expect a serial abuser to be a quitter either. Faced with accusations of abhorrent and criminal acts he can\u2019t acknowledge, plus impending incomprehensible defeat at the polls, and the very real possibility of becoming one of those people he so despises \u2014 a loser \u2014 Trump casts about for others to blame. Given his character, it\u2019s not surprising that he follows, as if by instinct, what we might call the Joel Steinberg path to self-exoneration \u2014 painting himself, and himself alone, as the ultimate innocent victim of abusive others in a world whose every aspect is \u201crigged\u201d against him. \\nIn his own telling, he, not the women he\u2019s demeaned or assaulted, is the abused one and he\u2019s taking it for us, for America. It\u2019s quite a self-portrait when you think about it and should make us appreciate all the more those women who stepped before the cameras, reported his sexual assaults, and left themselves open to further abuse from Trump and his supporters. They have done something rare and brave. It\u2019s one thing for a woman to say publicly that she has been sexually assaulted or battered or raped. Feminist speak-outs taught us decades ago to support our sisters by sharing our experience in this way. But it\u2019s another thing to name the perpetrator and call him to account. That\u2019s what these women have done. And wonder of wonders, most women and a whole lot of men believe them , and more than 60%, in the tepid language of the pollsters, \u201chave some concerns\u201d about the issue. Count that as a positive change of recent years \u2014 a light in dismal times. \\nOn the dark side, you never know what a sore loser and his loyal, bullying, misogynist followers might do. Say, for example, followers of the type who show up outside Hillary rallies with banners reading \u201cTrump that Bitch!\u201d The moment the trial of Joel Steinberg ended, armed guards surrounded him and hustled him off to prison. Unfortunately, when this election is over, whether Trump wins or loses, he\u2019s not likely to go away. \\nAnn Jones, a TomDispatch regular , is the author of several books on violence against women, including the feminist classic Women Who Kill and Next Time, She\u2019ll Be Dead: Battering and How to Stop It , which Gloria Steinem calls \u201cthe one book you should read\u201d on the subject.
