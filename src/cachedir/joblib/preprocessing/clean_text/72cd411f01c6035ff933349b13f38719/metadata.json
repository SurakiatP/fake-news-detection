[\u201cWe are asking the senator to withdraw his name for consideration as attorney general or for the   Donald Trump, to withdraw the nomination,\u201d Brooks said, CNN reports.  Brooks and the other protesters occupied Sessions\u2019s Alabama office for more than six hours before police removed and arrested them. The @NAACP  @AlabamaNAACP are occupying the Mobile office of @jeffsessions \u2014  untill he withdraws as a AG nominee or we\u2019re arrested. @tvonetv pic. twitter.   \u2014   Cornell Wm. Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) January 3, 2017,  \u201cWe were clear today: We want others to participate in acts of civil disobedience,\u201d Brooks told ABC News. \u201cThis is a matter of ongoing opposition to someone with a clear,   rights record in Senator Session. \u201d The six protesters were taken to jail. A court date has been set for January 30. Civil disobedience is 1 way for citizens to honor the rule of law. We were arrested to support a @TheJusticeDept for everyone. #stopsessions pic. twitter.   \u2014   Cornell Wm. Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) January 4, 2017,  Brooks said Senator Sessions\u2019s \u201cdisregard for voter suppression\u201d and his support of \u201cthe myth of voter fraud\u201d are among the reasons the civil rights organization publicly opposes his nomination as attorney general. A Selma,   Army veteran, Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump\u2019s candidacy. The   tapped the former U. S. attorney to serve as attorney general in November. The NAACP   Tuesday coincided with the publication of an open letter signed by a group of 1, 226 law professors opposing Sessions\u2019s nomination. \u201cIn 1986, the   Senate Judiciary Committee, in a bipartisan vote, rejected President Ronald Reagan\u2019s nomination of  . S. Attorney Sessions for a federal judgeship, due to statements Sessions had made that reflected prejudice against African Americans,\u201d the letter says. \u201cNothing in Senator Sessions\u2019 public life since 1986 has convinced us that he is a different man than the    attorney who was deemed too racially insensitive to be a federal district court judge. \u201d Senator Sessions has vehemently denied the allegations, as Breitbart News investigative reporter Julia Hahn notes, citing his record of supporting civil rights initiatives in Alabama and his efforts to bankrupt and dismantle the the Ku Klux Klan in the state through civil litigation.
