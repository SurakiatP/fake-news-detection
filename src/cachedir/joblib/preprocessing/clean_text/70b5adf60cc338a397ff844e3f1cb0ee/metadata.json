Perhaps nothing illustrates this better than a new survey showing that far too many \u201cmillennials\u201d are not just cool to \u201ccapitalism,\u201d but are actually cool with communism. As MarketWatch reports : \\nOf the 2,300 Americans polled by YouGov , 80% of baby boomers and 91% of the elderly agree with the statement that \u201ccommunism was and still is a problem\u201d in the world today. Millennials? Only 55%. \\nFurthermore, almost half of Americans between the ages of 16 and 20 said they would vote for a socialist, while 21% would go so far as to back a communist. \\nCapitalism, on the other hand, is viewed favorably by 64% of those over the age of 65, compared with only 42% of millennials. \\nCiting these results, the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation\u2019s Marion Smith stated, as quoted by MarketWatch , \u201cOne of the concerns [the foundation] has had since its establishment is that an emerging generation of Americans has little understanding of the collectivist system and its dark history.\u201d For sure. This was evidenced when a teenager once naively asked me, \u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about communism?\u201d Another registered a look of shock when I gave him part of the answer: During the 20th century, Marxist governments exterminated approximately 100 million people, making them history\u2019s most murderous ideologues. \\nRelated to this, MarketWatch also tells us that \u201ca third of millennials say they believe more people were killed under George W. Bush than Joseph Stalin,\u201d clearly oblivious to Stalin\u2019s psychopathic actions having accounted for upwards of 20 million of the above number. Of course, 82 percent of millennials at least knew who Stalin was. This cannot be said regarding Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung; 42 percent of millennials were unfamiliar with this mass murderer of approximately 60 million. Forty percent didn\u2019t know who Argentine Marxist and major Cuban Revolution figure Che Guevara was. With respect to Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, the \u201cunacquainted with\u201d figures were, respectively, 33 and 32 percent. \\nNot surprisingly, this ignorance goes beyond history. While it\u2019s troubling that almost half of those aged 16 to 20 would support a socialist, there\u2019s good and bad news here. And they\u2019re the same thing: \\nThese young people generally don\u2019t know what socialism is. \\nAs I wrote in February, \u201cPeople 18 to 29 just helped vault Senator Bernie Sanders to a resounding New Hampshire primary victory, not at all deterred by his socialist label. But while they view that positively, they don\u2019t believe in socialist (in Sanders\u2019) wealth redistribution. In fact, this research shows that they cotton to it little more than do average Americans and no more than their age group did 20 years ago. In other words, millennials may like the word socialism, but, as with so many others, they don\u2019t understand well what it signifies or the nature of those for whom they vote.\u201d \\nIn reality, the label \u201csocialism\u201d is applied loosely today, yet it has a firm definition. Note that socialism was popularized via Karl Marx\u2019s and Friedrich Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto . And under Marxist doctrine, \u201csocialism\u201d \u2014 or the socialist revolution \u2014 is the transitional phase that extinguishes economic freedom and ushers in communism. Moreover, there are no communist governments because \u201ccommunism\u201d is the culmination of socialism, the stage where, the fanciful theory goes, the government has melted away and everyone lives happily and harmoniously in a state of economic equality-induced bliss.
