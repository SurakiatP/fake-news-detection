( Devon Island ) NASA JPL are masters of making Mars look as dead and dry as possible, they are not really searching for life because they have known for a very long time already that life exists on every planet and moon out there, i hope you are all able to see what i see in this video! \\nThanks very much for Watching \\nPlease Share and Subscribe!!\""}, "time": 1742564162.2206373}
