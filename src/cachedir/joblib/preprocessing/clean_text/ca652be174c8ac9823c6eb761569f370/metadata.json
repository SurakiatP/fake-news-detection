[\u201cThe process began long ago, but it really formally begins on Wednesday,\u201d he said, referring to tax reform.  The executive orders will allow the Secretary of the Treasury, Stephen Mnuchin, to start looking for ways to simplify the tax code and change the cumbersome regulatory burden on businesses. \u201cPeople can\u2019t do their returns. They have no idea what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re too complicated,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI look forward to taking a hard look at the regulatory burden of our tax code, which consumes billions of productive hours and compliance costs. \u201d Trump said that his administration would continue to press for tax reform, promising that it would help \u201cstruggling Americans achieve their financial dreams. \u201d \u201cTogether, we will restore prosperity to this nation, a nation that we so dearly love, and to bring people who call this home into a great, great way of living and a great way of life,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562712.8571503}
