But I think now we\u2019ve reached a point where there isn\u2019t really any excuse to let this carry on. \\n\u201cWe know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations \u2013 it really is now down to us to act.\u201d \\nHowever the methodology of the report has been criticised. Image copyright CARLOS DREWS / WWF Image caption The report looked at data collected on 3,700 species of vertebrates over the last 40 years \\nThe Living Planet Report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the world\u2019s wildlife. \\nFor freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970 Dr Mike Barrett, WWF \\nThis analysis looked at 3,700 different species of birds, fish, mammals, amphibians and reptiles \u2013 about 6% of the total number of vertebrate species in the world. \\nThe team collected data from peer-reviewed studies, government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and NGOs. \\nAny species with population data going back to 1970, with two or more time points (to show trends) was included in the study. \\nThe researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time. \\nSome of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data (there are many records on Arctic and near Arctic birds, for example) or very little data (tropical amphibians, for example). The report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture. \\nThe last report, published in 2014, estimated that the world\u2019s wildlife populations had halved over the last 40 years. \\nThis assessment suggests that the trend has continued: since 1970, populations have declined by an average of 58%. \\nDr Barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others. \\n\u201cWe do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment \u2013 for freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970. This is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems, and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building, for example.\u201d \\nIt also highlighted other species, such as African elephants , which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching, and sharks, which are threatened by overfishing. \\nIf pressures \u2013 overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade for example \u2013 increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse Dr Robin Freeman, ZSL \\nThe researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of 2% each year, and warn that if nothing is done, wildlife populations could fall by 67% (below 1970 levels) by the end of the decade. \\nDr Robin Freeman, head of ZSL\u2019s Indicators & Assessments Unit, said: \u201cBut that\u2019s assuming things continue as we expect. If pressures \u2013 overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade, for example \u2013 increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse. \\n\u201cBut one of the things I think is most important about these stats, these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations \u2013 they are not extinctions. By and large they are not vanishing, and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it.\u201d Image copyright SCOTT DICKERSON Image caption There are still many gaps in our knowledge of the world\u2019s vertebrates \\nHowever, Living Planet reports have drawn some criticisms. \\nThere are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy Stuart Pimm, Duke University \\nStuart Pimm, professor of conservation ecology at Duke University in the United States, said that while wildlife was in decline, there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure. \\n\u201cThere are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very, very sketchy,\u201d he told BBC News. \\n\u201cFor example, if you look at where the data comes from, not surprisingly, it is massively skewed towards western Europe. \\n\u201cWhen you go elsewhere, not only do the data become far fewer, but in practice they become much, much sketchier\u2026 there is almost nothing from South America, from tropical Africa, there is not much from the tropics, period. Any time you are trying to mix stuff like that, it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean. \\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number\u2026. It\u2019s flawed.\u201d \\nBut Dr Freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely true that in some regions and in some groups, like tropical amphibians for example, we do have a lack of data. But that\u2019s because there is a lack of data. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that species that aren\u2019t being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse \u2013 but I\u2019d be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed. \u201c'"}, "time": 1742628319.0753853}
