In front of an audience at a small town synagogue, the award-winning businessman and conservative commentator laid out the key component that he believed would catapult any presidential candidate above all the others: \u201cputting Americans first.\u201d \\nDML emphasizes during his \u201cAmericans first\u201d speech that the number one issue in America is immigration. He explains in crystal clear detail how immigration, both legal and illegal, goes beyond party identification. He says \u201cit\u2019s not a Democrat or Republican issue \u2014 it\u2019s an American issue.\u201d \\nHaving traveled the country by car exploring the idea of running for president himself, DML got a real sense for what concerned Americans most. Therefore, he knew before the rest of us that the ideal candidate of 2016 would be someone who has the audacity and the courage to tell the American people he or she will commit to the deportation of illegal immigrants. \\n\u201cRemember, it\u2019s not an anti-immigration; it\u2019s an anti-illegal immigration; and it\u2019s about being pro-America.\u201d \\nWhile putting Americans first would have been DML\u2019s campaign theme had he chosen to run for the highest office in the land, this strategy was instead adopted by none other than Donald J.Trump. This is one major reason why DML has supported Trump since day one. \\nTrump has done more than proven DML correct. Trump has proven how powerful the \u201c Americans first\u201d ideology is during a day and age when progressive politicians like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are catering to foreign workers and corporate donors at the expense of the American people who are left to rot on the back burner. \\nWatch an excerpt from the speech, and then check out DML\u2019s electoral map and how he sees Trump winning on Tuesday. \\n\\nSign up to get breaking news alerts from Dennis Michael Lynch.
