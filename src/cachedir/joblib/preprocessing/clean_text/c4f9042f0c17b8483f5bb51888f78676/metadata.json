[BREAKING NEWS: @HolmesJosh: @SenateMajLdr to suggest Merrick Garland as next Director of the FBI. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Fox News (@FoxNews) May 14, 2017,   \u201cI think the Senate majority leader thinks that\u2019s a fantastic idea,\u201d Holmes said in a panel discussion on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d and reported by the Washington Examiner. Last week, Sen. Mike Lee ( ) suggested that instead of appointing a special prosecutor to look into   candidate Donald Trump\u2019s Russian ties and his recent firing of James Comey as FBI director, the president should pick Garland to replace Comey. Garland, chief judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was nominated by former President Barack Obama to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but Republicans refused to take up the nomination because of the impending presidential election. Instead of a special prosecutor, @realDonaldTrump should nominate Merrick Garland to replace James Comey.  \u2014   Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) May 11, 2017,  \u201cI would imagine that this might be a post that might interest [Garland] and it might be a post that he could serve in very effectively,\u201d Lee told Fox\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d on Thursday. \u201cThe idea of Garland ascending to the FBI post was also floated Wednesday by the Daily Caller, which speculated Garland\u2019s confirmation would clear a coveted seat on the influential D. C. Court of Appeals, allowing Trump to appoint a   judge,\u201d Fox News reported, noting that  Conn Carroll, Lee\u2019s spokesperson, dismissed the idea. \u201cGarland is an experienced federal prosecutor who oversaw the [Oklahoma City] bombing investigation,\u201d Carroll wrote in an email to Fox News. \u201cHe has the reputation necessary to restore trust in the FBI. \u201cThis is not about the D. C. Circuit,\u201d Carroll said. \u201c[McConnell] certainly thinks he will be qualified and he certainly thinks he would be somebody that he could support,\u201d Holmes said. The Trump administration is already interviewing candidates for the top job at the FBI, with officials saying a decision could be made as early as next week.'"}, "time": 1742561781.1192138}
