Mili had come up with a way to photograph trails of light, and he wanted to shoot Picasso \u201cdrawing\u201d in midair with a light pen  \u2014   a process that would leave no trace except on film. Picasso loved it. The result, published in Life and exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, was Picasso\u2019s celebrated series of \u201clight drawings\u201d of bulls and centaurs and the like  \u2014   photographs that captured him in the act of creating the ultimate in ephemeral art. Picasso is long gone. But some 68 years later, Google has been calling on dozens of artists, animators and illustrators with a   update of Mili\u2019s concept  \u2014   a virtual reality setup that enables people to paint with light that actually stays where you put it, at least for viewers wearing a VR headset. In place of Gjon Mili are Drew Skillman and Patrick Hackett, a pair of video game developers turned virtual reality enthusiasts who live in San Francisco. They were trying to build a   chess application one night a couple of years ago when they discovered it had an unexpected side effect: As you moved the chess pieces around in virtual space, they left trails of light behind. Sensing that their bug was in fact a feature, the two dropped the chess project immediately and hurled themselves at the light trails, hoping to develop a tool for drawing in three dimensions. In April 2015, seven months after they had cobbled together a rudimentary system they called Tilt Brush, Google bought their company for an undisclosed sum  \u2014   which is how Mr. Skillman and Mr. Hackett have come to be ensconced in the company\u2019s offices near the downtown waterfront here. With Google\u2019s support, Tilt Brush has attracted a team of developers and evolved into a sophisticated tool for drawing, painting, even sculpting in space. It was released in April as a free   to the new HTC Vive, an $800 virtual reality system produced by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC in partnership with Valve, an American video game developer. (It\u2019s on sale as a $30 software package from Valve\u2019s online store.) Reviewers immediately dubbed it the Vive\u2019s killer app. This is hardly the kind of reception the two inventors were expecting when they started working on it in Mr. Skillman\u2019s apartment, a    studio in South Park, the little neighborhood that has been a hub for San Francisco\u2019s digerati since the 1990s. \u201cNot in our wildest dreams,\u201d said Mr. Skillman, a slightly built    with a neatly trimmed beard and a modest, unassuming manner. Tilt Brush got its name because in its earliest versions, you would draw or paint on a   surface that could be tilted in any direction in virtual space. But because the HTC Vive includes not just a virtual reality headset but also a pair of   controllers and two tracking sensors that map your movement in space, the program was revamped to enable you to paint or draw anywhere within a   area  \u2014   no surface required. One controller serves as a palette, with dozens of colors and effects the other acts as a brush or pen. To watch someone use it is a bit unnerving, since the person appears to be making marks in midair, but you can\u2019t actually see those. But put on a Vive headset and step between the sensors yourself  \u2014   as I did in a windowless room in Google\u2019s New York offices  \u2014   and the illusion of delusion disappears. Instead, you suddenly see what has been produced: a phantom creation in three dimensions, something you can walk around, walk through, poke your head inside, do everything except touch. Google\u2019s investment in virtual reality pales beside Facebook\u2019s $2 billion purchase of the VR pioneer Oculus. Still, Tilt Brush is part of a growing effort, one that began with the introduction in 2014 of supercheap cardboard headsets that work with smartphones, and continues with the recent release of a stunning virtual reality version of Google Earth as a free download for Vive owners. Over the past year, Google has invited more than 60 people to try Tilt Brush and offer feedback, and this week the company is unveiling their work and participation. \u201cYou would never want to create an artistic tool with only engineers,\u201d said Mr. Skillman. \u201cThat\u2019s just absurd. \u201d According to Tory Voight, Google\u2019s Tilt Brush program manager, those who have joined this    program include Dustin Yellin, a Brooklyn artist known for his   collages encased in layers of glass, and Jonathan Yeo, a British painter whose portrait of Kevin Spacey as the fictional American president Francis J. Underwood was exhibited last year at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Portrait Gallery. Jeff Koons, whose art works have sold at auction for as much as $58 million, had early access, though he was not part of the artists in residence program. Bob Mankoff, Roz Chast and other cartoonists for The New Yorker have also checked it out, as has Alex Hirsch, the young animator behind Disney\u2019s hit television series \u201cGravity Falls. \u201d Last June, Mr. Hirsch posted a sample creation on Twitter along with an enthusiastic status update: \u201cDrawing in virtual reality makes you feel like a   wizard god!\u201d But the first to try it was Glen Keane, a   figure who in his 37 years at Disney had brought the warmth of   animation to such characters as Ariel (in \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d) Aladdin, Tarzan and Pocahontas. \u201cWhen I left Disney in 2012,\u201d Mr. Keane said recently in his studio, a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in West Hollywood, Calif. \u201cI told them it was because I know there\u2019s something new coming  \u2014   I don\u2019t know what it is, but I need to leave to find it. \u201d He was still looking when he met Regina Dugan, then the leader of Google\u2019s secretive Advanced Technology and Products group, which was experimenting with virtual reality. First he partnered with the group to make a   virtual reality short called \u201cDuet,\u201d a charming piece released in 2014 about two babies growing up that was shortlisted for an Academy Award. \u201cDuet\u201d broke new ground, since animation in virtual reality had almost exclusively been  . But though he\u2019d spent a lifetime drawing on paper, Mr. Keane had always dreamed of being able to make the paper disappear. \u201cThe goal would be to animate not on paper but in space,\u201d he said. Enter Tilt Brush, which Mr. Keane encountered when Mr. Skillman introduced himself at a visual effects conference in San Francisco. Though still in a primitive state, it was maturing rapidly, and Mr. Keane soon became a convert. In September 2015, seven months before its release, he previewed its capabilities with \u201cStep Into the Page,\u201d a   video. \u201cThe edges of the paper are no longer there,\u201d he exclaimed in a   as he did a loose, freehand sketch of Ariel in virtual space. \u201cThis is not a flat drawing. This is sculptural drawing. \u201d Scott McCloud, the graphic artist whose book \u201cUnderstanding Comics\u201d is considered the ultimate guide to the art form, got to play with Tilt Brush when Google invited him to its Silicon Valley headquarters in August. \u201cI don\u2019t mind saying, I\u2019m a little bit obsessed with this program,\u201d he said as we sat in his small,   office in a mall in the Los Angeles exurb of Thousand Oaks. \u201cOne thing that appeals to me the most is, it\u2019s still very early. Everyone is asking fundamental questions. We\u2019re still trying to figure out what people are going to use it for. I love it when technology is in that stage. \u201d So, what are people going to use it for? Mr. McCloud threw out a few suggestions: performance art, virtual sculpture, industrial prototyping. \u201cI doodle with it,\u201d said Mr. Yeo, the painter, who spoke by telephone from London. \u201cI describe it as a   sketchbook. \u201d What it won\u2019t produce is anything resembling comics as they currently exist in the medium some call \u201cFlatland. \u201d For denizens of Flatland who have learned to work within the constraints of   this can be problematic. Mr. Mankoff, the cartoon editor at The New Yorker, came up with some characteristically     drawings during the two days he spent using Tilt Brush with Ms. Chast and other colleagues at Google\u2019s New York offices. But though he professes to have enjoyed the experience, he seems unlikely to lead The New Yorker out of Flatland. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably find a sharp divide between older and younger cartoonists,\u201d he said. \u201cOr it may just not work  \u2014   but that\u2019s no reason not to try it. \u201d One suggestion the New Yorker team had: cubes and cylinders and other   shapes to draw on, \u201cso you\u2019re not starting from zero in   space. \u201d (Google has since implemented a similar idea.) Other than that, Mr. Mankoff offered with a grin: \u201cThe advice I would have for Google is, more cats. You can\u2019t go wrong with cats. \u201d Mr. Keane has a different item on his wish list. Currently, works created in Tilt Brush are as motionless as a New Yorker cartoon. They\u2019re essentially static, and Mr. Keane is an animator. \u201cTo me, the thing to conquer is to be able to animate in real time in space,\u201d he said as I viewed a Tilt Brush drawing called \u201cVictory Dance\u201d in his studio. The piece captures a brief moment in time, seconds after his daughter\u2019s high school choir had won a national championship  \u2014   but it begs to be brought to life. \u201cJust like you have a spatial dimension, you\u2019ve got to have time as a dimension,\u201d Mr. Keane continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m not smart enough to figure it out. But Drew is. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628591.1364584}
