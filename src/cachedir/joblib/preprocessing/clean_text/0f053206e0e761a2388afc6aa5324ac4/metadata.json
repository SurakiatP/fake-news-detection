The disclosure, reported in the state news media, appeared to be the latest sign of the Iranian leadership\u2019s frustration over the agreement, which has failed so far to yield the significant economic benefits for the country that its advocates had promised. Iranian officials have blamed the United States for that problem. Despite the relaxations of many sanctions under the accord, which took effect in January, Iran faces enormous obstacles in attracting new investments and moving its own money through the global financial system. The Iranians are still blocked from using American banks, an important transit point for international capital, because of    sanctions imposed by the United States. There were unconfirmed reports last week that the Iranian authorities had arrested Abdolrasoul Dorri Esfahani, who has dual Iranian and Canadian citizenship, on espionage suspicions. Mr. Esfahani, an adviser to Iran\u2019s central bank, helped the Iranian nuclear negotiators bargain for sanctions relief in exchange for Iran\u2019s pledges of verifiably peaceful nuclear work. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said a spokesman for Iran\u2019s judiciary, Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei, speaking at a weekly news conference on Sunday in Tehran, had \u201cconfirmed the arrest of an individual from the negotiating team. \u201d But the spokesman also said that \u201chis charge of spying has not been proved\u201d and that the suspect had been released on bail pending an investigation. The spokesman did not identify the suspect by name, which was considered unusual. He also did not explain why bail had been granted for an espionage charge, regarded as one of the gravest offenses. Nonetheless, it seemed clear that he was referring to Mr. Esfahani. Western analysts following the progression of the nuclear agreement said the arrest was worrisome. Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington, said in an email that it was a clear sign that Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, \u201cis unhappy over the slow pace at which the deal has been implemented. \u201d There was no immediate comment on Mr. Esfahani\u2019s fate from the government of Canada, which has been contending with the arrest of another dual citizen in Iran in recent weeks. In July, the Iranian authorities arrested Homa Hoodfar, a   anthropologist who studies the role of women in Muslim societies. The reason for her incarceration has not been made clear. The   arrest was one of a number of hostile signals from Iran recently. Three weeks ago, the authorities announced the execution of a nuclear scientist who had returned home from the United States, where, he claimed, he had been kidnapped by the C. I. A. The Iranians said the scientist had betrayed secrets to the enemy. And last week,   boats from Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy harassed American warships patrolling international waters in the Persian Gulf region at least four times, United States officials said, calling the actions dangerous and illegal. Ayatollah Khamenei, who supported the nuclear agreement, has increasingly denounced what he calls American duplicity in the negotiation and other matters. In a speech on Sunday reported by the state news media, for example, he criticized the United States for opposing Iran\u2019s purchase of a     system. \u201cWe face such an enemy that does not recognize any right of defense for our nation,\u201d the state news media reported Ayatollah Khamenei saying in the speech to air force commanders. \u201cIn fact, it says you should remain defenseless so that when we wish, we can invade you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564451.2595134}
