[\u201cBob Beckel was terminated today for making an insensitive remark to an   employee,\u201d Fox said in a statement Friday.  Beckel, an outspoken liberal who had served as Walter Mondale\u2019s 1984 presidential campaign manager, was frequently in hot water during his time at Fox, particularly for his occasional   cursing and controversial remarks. Beckel was a   of The Five, as well as an occasional guest on other Fox programs. It is the second time Beckel has been fired from the company after he was fired in June 2015 over his \u201cpersonal issues. \u201d Beckel had previously spent time in rehab for an addiction to prescription pain medication. \u201cWe tried to work with Bob for months, but we couldn\u2019t hold The Five hostage to one man\u2019s personal issues,\u201d Bill Shine,   vice president of programming, said in a statement at the time. \u201cHe took tremendous advantage of our generosity, empathy and goodwill and we simply came to the end of the road with him. \u201d Beckel later contested Shine\u2019s claim that he was taking advantage, tweeting that he had been recovering from back surgery. I just can\u2019t understand the anger in Fox statement. I was healing from major back surgery i could not walk, I took no advantage I got well,  \u2014   Robert G Beckel (@RobertGBeckel) June 26, 2015,  Beckel was rehired in January this year but, according to Variety, Fox\u2019s human resource department was made aware of the alleged remark Tuesday. After an internal investigation, Beckel was fired Friday. Fox\u2019s internal culture has been under the spotlight in recent months, amid a catalog of claims of both racial and sexual harassment at the company. Both Former CEO Roger Ailes, who died Thursday, and former host Bill O\u2019Reilly were fired after sexual harassment claims against them were made public. Both men have denied the allegations.
