[The homeowner, whose name has not been released, stepped outside his home early Monday morning and was approached by two men who robbed him, KTRK ABC13 reported. After taking the man\u2019s wallet, the suspects attempted to flee in a gray pickup truck. The elderly man pulled a handgun and opened fire, striking the truck several times in the rear window.  The truck was later found at a car wash with one person inside the truck. That man had been shot and police later determined he was one of the suspects in the robbery. The suspect was transported to Ben Taub Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The other suspect remains  . The son of the homeowner told reporters from KHOU CBS11 his father was simply defending himself. He said the man felt he had no choice but to fire after having a gun to his head. A neighbor told the reporter he was awakened to the sound of gunfire. \u201cWhen I laid down, I hear go, \u2018Pow, pow, pow, pow\u2019 real loud, and then I heard commotion, like voices,\u201d the neighbor told KHOU. In addition to being a homeowner, the man also owns rental property in the neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m glad that our landlord is OK, \u2019cause we depend on him a lot,\u201d one of his tenants told the local CBS affiliate. \u201cHe looks out for us, he makes a lot of repairs around here, and he works very hard. \u201d The medical examiner has not yet been able to identify the suspects as a fingerprint search did not provide a positive match. The homeowner was not charged, but per normal procedure, the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office will present the case to a grand jury.
