Two of the strikes hit a civilian house within, killing eight civilians from a single family, including three children. \\nIt is unclear why the report of this airstrike is just coming to light now, over a week later, but it marks the first significant civilian casualties in a US airstrike related to the Mosul invasion. A previous incident the day before, initially reported as a US airstrike against a Shi\u2019ite mosque near Kirkuk, is now being reported as likely an attack by the Iraqi Air Force, and not the US. \\nPentagon officials confirmed conducting a number of airstrikes against Fadhiliya at the time of the civilian deaths, and say they are conducting \u201cfurther investigation\u201d to determine all the facts related to the attack. Saying the take the allegations seriously. \\nAs the fighting around Mosul advances into more densely populated areas around the city itself, the concerns are growing that such airstrikes are going to cause a number of civilian casualties. This is doubly true because now Iraq is warning residents of Mosul against fleeing, and the US has announced its intention to carry out airstrikes to prevent \u201cfleeing ISIS\u201d from getting away.
