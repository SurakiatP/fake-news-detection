The mayor\u2019s office estimated that 400, 000 people took part in the march, which was in concert with other Women\u2019s March rallies across the country. With huge crowds along Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower, a large slice of Manhattan came to a standstill for much of the day. Participants booed Mr. Trump and hoisted signs mocking both his hair and his relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. It was a moment of both catharsis and camaraderie in a city that was, for the most part, shocked and disappointed by Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendance to the presidency. Holding a \u201cNasty Woman\u201d sign, Grace Huezo, 20, was buoyed by the huge turnout and the joyful mood. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful to see so many people that are not giving up and they\u2019re keeping their spirit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all just going to stick together over the next four years. \u201d Ms. Huezo, a student at Hunter College, said she was marching with her sister to defend women\u2019s rights. She said she was appalled by the 2005 recording of Mr. Trump\u2019s lewd comments about women that emerged during the campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re here saying, \u2018No, people do not have permission to grab women without our permission,\u2019\u201d she said. The march began with a rally near Trump World Tower on the East Side, where Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio, led the crowd in urging Mr. Trump not to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cNew York City has always been the center of progressive America, and that will never change,\u201d she said. The actress Whoopi Goldberg suggested it would be the first of many marches while Mr. Trump was in office. Hinting at the debate over diversity leading up to the marches, one speaker said she wanted equal pay, and \u201cnot just for white women. \u201d Throughout the day, marchers clogged city streets and overwhelmed subway stations. Men and women wore pink \u201cpussy hats\u201d and held signs that read, \u201cYou lost here, Donald,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Still With Her. \u201d Around 4 p. m. near Trump Tower, a wall of police officers tried to keep people moving as protesters chanted, \u201cBlack Lives Matter. \u201d Alice Bucaille said she wanted to bring her two daughters to the march, but decided against it because of violence on Friday after the inauguration ceremony in Washington. Ms. Bucaille said she would have welcomed women with views that differed from hers on abortion, and added that Democrats could no longer live in a bubble. \u201cWe need to open the discussion and understand where people are coming from,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing inclusive is part of the conversation. \u201d Plenty of children attended the march with parents and grandparents. Along the route, Annabel Lui, 6, stood on a bench proudly holding a sign that said: \u201cLittle Donald, you\u2019ve been a bad boy. Now go to your room for the next four years. \u201d   stopped to watch as she chanted, \u201cTrump has to go!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562953.0905979}
