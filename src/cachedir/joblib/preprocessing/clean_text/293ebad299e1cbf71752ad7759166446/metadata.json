Western nations, in particular the United States and Britain, are prime suspects. However, there are plenty of unwitting commentators in the emerging world who are playing into the West\u2019s hands. Each year, as the BRICS summit draws near, the cacophony from these haters grows louder. Questions about the viability and relevance of the BRICS are raised in the media. \\nDuring the build-up to the Goa summit this year, the refrain was similar but with the background buzz that the India-China rift over Pakistan-backed terrorism would derail the summit. However, the predicted outcome of an implosion didn\u2019t materialise and, on the contrary, with India and Russia inking the S-400 missile deal , Goa 2016 turned out to be a memorable event. \\nSince many innocent readers may have been misinformed by the compromised commentators \u2013 who will certainly be back like a bounced cheque next year \u2013 here\u2019s a ready reckoner on the BRICS group. So the next time you hear remarks that the BRICS are collapsing, don\u2019t lose sleep over the issue. \\nWorld needs BRICS \\nMost of the global multilateral institutions that exist today are no longer relevant. The IMF and the World Bank, for instance, were founded during the closing years of World War II. In geopolitical time, that\u2019s ancient history. Similarly, the G-7 appears to be on life support and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) is no longer a leading organisation. \\nWith the western economies perched on monetary and budgetary cliffs, the five BRICS members provide a stable alternate force that offsets the West\u2019s decline. Both China and India continue to experience high economic growth and are on course to become mega economies that will completely dwarf the West in the coming decades. Beijing\u2019s growth may have fallen under 7 per cent but that\u2019s enough to add the equivalent of Holland\u2019s national income to the Chinese GDP. \\nBottom line: without the BRICS, the world economy will experience 1929 all over again. \\nBRICS slowdown, not a meltdown \\nUday Kotak, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank, feels India should quit the BRICS coalition because of the slowdown in four of the five economies. His view has been echoed by several so-called experts. But curiously, have you ever heard any economist or banker say the OECD must disband because it has basket cases such as Greece or terror exporters such as Turkey? \\nAccording to the US-based Centre on Global Interests , \u201cYou can look at the BRICS from the financial market's point of view, or from a geopolitical point of view. But whichever lens you view it through, what you see is the same: despite economic slowdowns and even economic hardship in some nations, these are far and away the most powerful countries outside of the developed core. Their economies have scale. Their decisions can move financial markets. They have intellectual capital and clout within their regions. And in terms of foreign policy, they are the counterweight to a unipolar world run largely by Washington and its friends in London and Brussels.\u201d \\nIt adds: \u201cIn both of these regards \u2013 economics and foreign policy \u2013 the BRICS are alive and kicking. In fact, they are more relevant today than they were in November 2001, when Jim O'Neill grouped them into the strange bedfellows that they have become.\u201d \\nBilaterals can\u2019t bring down the BRICS \\nIf the UN fails to discuss relevant political issues, the international body is considered a failure. But BRICS is not a platform that was created for discussing politics. The primary role of the five-member group is to remove the West\u2019s grip from the levers that control the world economy. By establishing their own New Development Bank, the BRICS have ensured that the IMF is no longer the world\u2019s lender-of-last-resort. \\nIn this backdrop, fears that bilateral issues involving India and China will wreck summits have consistently proved to be baseless. \\nTake Goa 2016. While the Goa Declaration mentions terror, the focus of the summit was not terrorism at all. Sure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a shot at Pakistan, describing it as the \u201cmothership of terrorism\u201d, and China defended its ally by saying it had made \u201cgreat sacrifices\u201d. But both New Delhi and Beijing were merely playing to their respective galleries even as the real summitry was happening behind closed doors. \\nTo be sure, politics can be tabled if it\u2019s a side dish \u2013 like Syria was a couple of years ago \u2013 but issues with the potential to derail the summit simply have no place in BRICS. \\nCritics of the BRICS often point to the India-China border issue as evidence of serious problems. But this misses the point. There always will be different opinions and views among the BRICS countries \u2013 just like there are differences among NATO or European Union members. \\nBRICS are not united but it doesn\u2019t matter \\nUnlike NATO or the European Union, where the member countries have more or less the same goals and are also of the same racial stock, each of the BRICS countries is different. However, their membership of BRICS gives them a common goal \u2013 development. As emerging countries, they are focussed on raising their standards of living. \\nThe fact that they are united as a group, despite such stark differences in national goals, opinions and geopolitical rivalries and even outright hostilities, points to the viability of the BRICS.\""}, "time": 1742562228.3565345}
