Friday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox  Friends,\u201d network correspondent Ed Henry reported Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) had revealed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential nominee for the Democratic Party, and six of her aides retained their access to top secret and classified information after leaving the State Department in 2013.  \u201cWe\u2019re learning from Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that she and six staffers in 2013 retained clearances where they still had access to top secret and classified information,\u201d Henry said. \u201cWhy? They were titled \u2018research assistants.\u2019 So the assumption on Capitol Hill is it was because she was writing her memoirs and saying, \u2018Look, I still need access to this information in order to go through what happened in Syria, what happened with Russia. But obviously think back to what James Comey said in how Hillary Clinton handled classified information. \u201d Henry was referring to Comey\u2019s July 2016 statement calling Clinton \u201cextremely careless\u201d in how she handled classified information. \u201cHe obviously believes something needs to be done about this,\u201d Henry added. \u201cThe only positive for Chuck Grassley at this point is, there\u2019s no longer a Democrat at the State Department, obviously. You got Rex Tillerson, so if you have these documents on why she retained these clearances, and for example does she still have a clearance today? A lot of former officials get to keep these clearances for years  \u2014   when they\u2019re consultants   \u2026     some of them like to retain it because they say I was in the middle of all of these important issues. I need to keep abreast of it. Been then some of these folks in Washington  \u2014   they say drain the swamp. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742628369.0913866}
