Of course the most famous example of this is Detroit . At one time, Detroit was the greatest manufacturing city that the world had ever seen and it had the highest per capita income in the entire country. But now it has become a rotting, decaying hellhole that the rest of the planet laughs at. And of course Detroit is far from alone. There are hundreds of other U.S. cities that are suffering a similar fate. In this article, the focus is going to be on Camden, New Jersey, but the truth is that there are lots of other \u201cDetroits\u201d and \u201cCamdens\u201d all over the nation. Jobs and businesses are leaving our cities at a staggering rate, and what is being left behind is poverty, crime and extreme desperation. \\nEarlier this month, Rolling Stone published an article that took a hard look at the nightmare conditions that exist in Camden. A city that once made Campbell\u2019s soup and some of this nation\u2019s most famous warships is now a national disgrace. The following are six of the best quotes out of that article\u2026 \\n-\u201cIn September, its last supermarket closed, and the city has been declared a \u201cfood desert\u201d by the USDA. The place is literally dying, its population having plummeted from above 120,000 in the Fifties to less than 80,000 today.\u201d \\n-\u201cTheir home is a city with thousands of abandoned houses but no money to demolish them, leaving whole blocks full of Ninth Ward-style wreckage to gather waste and rats.\u201d \\n-\u201cWith legal business mostly gone, illegal business took hold. Those hundreds of industries have been replaced by about 175 open-air drug markets, through which some quarter of a billion dollars in dope moves every year.\u201d \\n-\u201cOn January 18th, 2011, the city laid off 168 of its 368 police officers, kicking off a dramatic, years-long, cops-versus-locals, house-to-house battle over a few square miles of North American territory that should have been national news, but has not been, likely because it took place in an isolated black and Hispanic ghost town.\u201d \\n-\u201cAfter the 2011 layoffs, police went into almost total retreat. Drug dealers cheerfully gave interviews to local reporters while slinging in broad daylight.\u201d \\n-\u201cThe carnage left Camden\u2019s crime rate on par with places like Haiti after its 2010 earthquake, and with other infamous Third World hot spots, as police officials later noticed to their dismay when they studied U.N. statistics.\u201d \\nYou can read the rest of the article right here . But as bad as things have become in Camden, this should not be a surprise to most of you. The reality is that this kind of rot and decay is happening in communities all over the United States. \\nOver in Detroit, crime has gotten so bad that even the police are telling people to \u201c enter Detroit at your own risk \u201c. When you call the police in Detroit it takes them an average of 58 minutes to respond, and more than 90 percent of the crimes committed in the city end up as unsolved mysteries. \\nAt this point, 60 percent of all children in Detroit are living in poverty, and there are approximately 78,000 abandoned homes in the city. \\nFor much more on all this, check out the statistics in this article , and you can find some great photos of the \u201cruins of Detroit\u201d right here . \\nSo why is all of this happening? \\nWell, there are lots of factors involved of course, but the biggest one is the lack of good jobs in these cities. \\nAt one time, Detroit had the largest and most prosperous middle class in the entire nation. But now those days are long gone. \\nAnd what is happening to Detroit is precisely what is happening to America as a whole. Our good jobs are disappearing and the middle class is being systematically destroyed . \\nIn order to have a middle class, you have got to have middle class jobs. \\nThere is no way around that. \\nAnd right now, hordes of young people are graduating from college and discovering that the middle class jobs that they were promised simply are not there. \\nCNN recently profiled a 37-year-old college graduate named Bobby Bingham. Because he cannot find a good job, he is forced to work four low paying jobs\u2026 \\nBobby Bingham works four jobs in Kansas City, Missouri, yet he has very little to show for it. \\nBingham is 37 years old and has a college degree, but like many Americans, is stuck working many hours in low wage, part-time jobs. \\nEach week, he works a total of about 60 hours in his jobs as a massage therapist, a waiter at a Mexican restaurant, a delivery man for sandwich chain Jimmy John\u2019s and a receptionist at his massage school. \\nBingham makes approximately $400 a week, which works out to about $20,000 a year. He has come to the conclusion that he may never be able to make enough to support a family\u2026 \\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to the point in my life where I wonder if I can ever support a family,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no idea how that\u2019s ever going to logically happen.\u201d \\nThat deeply saddened my heart when I read that. Here is a young man that wants to get married, have a family and do all the right things, but the economy is so bad that he fears that this may never be possible for him. \\nAs I have written about previously, the economic downturn that we are experiencing right now has hit men particularly hard . The number of men in their prime working years that do not make enough money to support a family is rising with each passing year, and this is causing massive problems in this country. \\nAnd when our politicians proclaim that all we need is \u201cmore education\u201d, I feel like vomiting. The U.S. population as a whole has more \u201ceducation\u201d today than it ever has had before. \\nIf you think that \u201cmore education\u201d is the answer, then check out the following excerpt from a recent interview with a law school graduate that is making about $40,000 a year and that has about $200,000 in law school debt\u2026 \\nYes, it\u2019s extremely hard to get by. I can\u2019t afford rent or a car and can barely afford food. Anything extra like enjoying myself with friends, going to a movie, traveling, etc. \u2014 that\u2019s all out the window for the foreseeable future and possibly for the rest of my life thanks to law school. I live with my parents. I don\u2019t have a car. I don\u2019t go out to socialize. I don\u2019t date. I don\u2019t buy new clothes. I don\u2019t buy electronics. I don\u2019t buy much of anything. I spend my free time working other jobs to put more money toward my debt. I do contract work for other lawyers, but the pay is very low and payment is sporadic. \\nWhy did this happen to him? Well, the truth is that there are way, way too many law school graduates. There are not nearly enough good jobs for all of them. In fact, this particular law school graduate deeply regrets ever going to law school and considers it \u201can extraordinary waste of money\u201d\u2026 \\nI consider law school a waste of my life and an extraordinary waste of money. I feel like I was duped and tricked. At the end of the day, it\u2019s my own fault for being a sucker and I learned an extremely hard lesson. Because I went to law school, I don\u2019t see myself having a family, earning a comfortable wage, or having an enjoyable lifestyle. \\nBut at least he has a job. There are millions of college graduates that do not. And there are hundreds of thousands of other college graduates that are currently working as waiters and waitresses. Large numbers are also working temp jobs or standing behind registers in retail stores. \\nOver the past decade, tens of thousands of businesses and millions of good jobs have left this country. The quality of the jobs that remain continues to decline at a frightening pace , and most of the new jobs that are being \u201ccreated\u201d these days are part-time jobs. \\nBut you won\u2019t hear the mainstream media or our most prominent politicians talk about these things much. You won\u2019t hear them talk about the fact that median household income in the United States has fallen for five years in a row or about the fact that the rate of homeownership in the United States has fallen for eight years in a row . \\nThe middle class is dying . \\nWake up America. \\nAnd even as millions of our jobs have been shipped to the other side of the planet, some of the most prominent \u201cAmerican companies\u201d have been bought up by foreigners. The following list comes from a recent Economy In Crisis article \u2026 \u2014\u2013 \\nHere are some of America\u2019s most famous brands currently held in foreign hands: Budweiser, now owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev N.V., which is based in Leuven, Belgium Alka-Seltzer, now owned by German company Bayer Schering Pharma AG Ben & Jerrys, now owned by British-Dutch Unilever AMC theaters, now owned by the Chinese 7-Eleven, now owned by the Japanese company, Seven & I Holdings Woman\u2019s Day Magazine, now owned by the French company, Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias, S.A Purina, now owned by the Swiss company, Nestle Gerber, now owned by the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Novartis Firestone, now owned by the Japanese Bridgestone Corporation Citgo, now owned by the government of Venezuela French\u2019s Mustard, now owned by Reckitt Benckiser, a British conglomerate Frigidaire, now owned by Sweden\u2019s AB Electrolux The Plaza Hotel in New York City, now owned by Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva\u2019s El-Ad Group Trader Joes, now owned by German billionaires Karl and Theo Albrecht Dial soap, now owned by Henkel KGaA, based in Dusseldorf, Germany Sunglass Hut, now owned by Italian eyewear seller Luxottica Group \u2014\u2013 \\nAre you starting to get the picture? \\nOur economic infrastructure is being absolutely gutted and more than 46 million Americans are now living in poverty. \\nAnd if you are waiting for the jokers in Washington D.C. to fix things, you are going to be waiting for a very, very long time. \\nOver the past several years, both the Democrats and the Republicans have proven again and again that they are basically completely and totally useless. In fact, just about everything that they try to do actually makes our problems even worse. \\nIn just a few days, Barack Obama leaves for a 17 day holiday vacation in Hawaii. Many have criticized him and the members of Congress for taking so much time off, but perhaps that is the best thing that they can do at this point. As long as they are away from Washington D.C., at least they won\u2019t be making things even worse for all the rest of us. Dent, Faber, Celente, Maloney, Rogers \u2013 What Do They Say Is Coming In 2014? \u00bb MegaLiberty74 \\nIt\u2019s the deindustrialization of America by big government through taxations, fines, fees, extreme regulations, etc. Eventually, the business owner who can\u2019t pay in D.C. to get exempted from such criminal government as like we are seeing with Obamacare, they throw their hands up and say DONE. \\nWho\u2019s John Galt? This was all predicted and it\u2019s basic economics. JoeD \\nJohn Galt was a creepy celibate perv who settled on being dirty thirds with Dagny Taggart. \\nAmerica as an industrial power could never compete with the rest of the world once the rug was pulled out from under its feet. You blame taxes and regulation but that\u2019s what comes with maintaining a first world country. No way to compete with the China\u2019s of the world that are willing to poison their people with toxic pollution and have billions of people willing to work for slave wages. Of course instead of choosing to protect ourselves we decided it would be a better idea to save a few bucks at Walmart. jox \\nTo reduce the taxes you should cut military expenses, not healthcare nor education. Sonar \\nSo tell that to communist China and Russia which are both increasing military expenditures while spending very little on social services for their people? some-buh-day \\nAnother masterpiece, Michael. That last paragraph is golden lol. Don\u2019t forget that people are leaving the country in record numbers also 1stworlder \\nThose are productive people trying to go Galt to somewhere with lower taxes Chris \\nRoss Perot warned us this would eventually happen, but we failed to listen. In all honesty, we deserve everything we\u2019re getting now. We voted for all of this. Politicians realized a long time ago that most people were uniformed about what was happening around them, thus allowing them to pass these ludicrous trade agreements that only benefited a handful of individuals. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late to save the ship now. Rodster \\nIt was the \u201cgiant sucking sound\u201d, so true. Mondobeyondo \\nThe \u201cgiant sucking sound\u201d is coming from DC. 2Gary2 \\nthe giant sucking sound is conservative policies sucking the wealth of the middle class up to their 1% who they exclusively represent. Sonar \\nthe giant sucking sound is progressive/liberal/leftist/socialist/communist policies sucking the wealth of the middle class up to their 1% cronies like George Soros along with bankers and hedge funds managers who put their stooge into the White House dbomb12 \\nDon\u2019t forget the \u201cCONSERVATIVE\u201d heritage foundation supported NAFTA. The left / right paradigm is the real divider. All polititcians are part of the same culb and we are not in it FUKyiah \\nWHAT conservative policies? What planet are you from?

By that I mean dumb America haters and I think you would qualify on both counts. Why do you pretend to be so dense and dumb? You know what I meant to start with, and if you are too slow to get it, well then, I just told you. Pablo Solano \\nLaughable. Spouting meaningless rubbish. It saddens me to think of the trees that produced oxygen that has been wasted on you. GSOB \\nI didn\u2019t vote for any of this. In fact, I voted for Ross Perot. Geoff Gariepy \\nRoss Perot was looking out for Ross Perot. Mondobeyondo \\nSo did I. He would have made a difference if he had been elected. But this is a democracy, er, constitutional republic, and the people wanted Clinton. Kannin \\nThe people didn\u2019t want Clinton! He won with less than 50% of the vote. Ross Perot only served to divide the conservative vote. djc \\nI voted for him twice. Its all really hopeless at this stage of the game. JulietteofOhio \\nWE don\u2019t deserve this and WE didn\u2019t fail to listen.There just weren\u2019t enough of US to make a difference, but WE are suffering along with everyone else. I do agree it\u2019s too late to save the ship. J Hall \\nAnd the opportunity is likely to come sooner than most expects. Mondobeyondo \\nHow did these politicians get to such high levels of power? Someone voted for them. We don\u2019t have coup d\u2019etats in America (or do we?) \\nDetroit is my favorite example of mismanagement. And NO, it has NOTHING to do with black politicians in charge for the past 60 years there. It\u2019s government mismanagement, Kannin \\nIt was mismanagement and the unions. At the same time the government was growing too large too fast\u2026 and giving in to the public unions, the private unions were killing manufacturing jobs. What followed was fewer jobs and higher taxes to help support the bloated city. Then the wealthiest and the middle class fled to the burbs, and left the city to the poorest\u2026 who cannot afford to support the massive amounts of infrastructure and retirees. You can draw a very clear line between Detroit, Michigan and 20 other cities and states\u2026 St. Louis, Chicago, California and Illinois to name a few\u2026 mismanaged by liberal governments and unions\u2026 both, private and public. Annette Smith \\nI am so surprised that California has not declared bankruptcy. I don\u2019t know how it gets along. Used to live there, and glad we don\u2019t anymore. El Pollo de Oro \\nChris: to this day, I hate Rush \u201cPillhead\u201d Limbaugh with a passion for trashing Ross Perot. Pillhead was a big supporter of NAFTA and called Perot a racist for opposing it. But Perot was absolutely right about that \u201cgiant sucking sound.\u201d Americans ignored Perot at their own peril, and I think you\u2019re right about it being too late to save the ship now. Welcome to the Third World. Chris \\nEI Pollo de Oro: NAFTA and the rest of the free trade agreements were never meant to help us \u201clittle people.\u201d Its sole purpose was to turn First World countries into Third World dumps. If they pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, then it\u2019s lights out for good. El Pollo de Oro \\nChris: That\u2019s exactly what NAFTA (No American Factories Taking Applications) was designed to do: turn major developed economies into Third World toilets. And CAFTA made things even worse because it sent out a message that if globalists though minimum-wage workers in M\u00e9xico were overpaid, they could always move to countries that are even poorer (Honduras, Guatemalan, El Salvador). Globalism is truly a race to the bottom just as Perot predicted. Sequoia \\nNAFTA also screwed the Mexican people,because it wiped out all of the small family farms.Now the campesinos in Michoacan and other agriculture areas have to compete with the big Agribusiness corpotations in the USSA, and of course they can\u2019t compete with them. The campesinos went broke and could\u2019t compete and some of them had no choice than abandon their farms and try to cross the border ilegally into the USSA,to find work and survive. If there was no NAFTA,most of these people would have stayed in their home states,in Mexico Farming and surviving. NAFTA has screwed the Amaeicans, Mexicans and Canadians El Pollo de Oro \\nSequoia: Excellent point about how badly NAFTA hurt campesinos in M\u00e9xico. Although globalists won\u2019t admit it, there\u2019s a major connection between NAFTA and all the narcoviolencia south of the border. When campesinos lost their livelihood, los carteles took full advantage of that and put them to work. Sonar \\nNAFTA was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 8, 1993 and entered force January 1, 1994. Although it was signed by President Bush, it was a priority of President Clinton\u2019s, and its passage is considered one of his first successes by the Democrat Party. El Pollo de Oro \\nSonar: NAFTA is one of the many reasons I\u2019m neither a Republi-con nor a Democrap. Clinton and Gore supported NAFTA along with Rush \u201cPillhead\u201d Limbaugh and the Heritage Foundation. It was bipartisan rape of the American economy. So, bienvenidos, americanos, al tercer mundo. Annette Smith \\nAlways, follow the money. Danger_Close \\nLimbaugh had always been for the Establishment GOP and for Multi National Corporations. He has never cared about what\u2019s best for The Republic   or it\u2019s citizens. \\nHe threatened to leave for Singapore if Obama was reelected, yet for some reason, he\u2019s still in West Palm Beach. \\nAmericans ignored Perot, as the ignored Paul. Trouble is, both were right. El Pollo de Oro \\nDanger Close: Pillhead Limbaugh also threatened to move to Costa Rica because of the Unaffordable Care Act, which gave me a good laugh because in many parts of Latin America, he would be a prime candidate for the dreaded Desperate People Doing Desperate Things Tax. Pillhead might be OK in Costa Rica, which is one of the safer countries in Latin America. But in Venezuela, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras or Colombia, he would be a prime candidate for a kidnapping. The kidnappers/DPDDTT collectors are no joke in those countries. GSOB \\nI like Rush more than I know you. Annette Smith \\nRush was okay when he started. He has become filthy and vulgar. He has been outright disgustingly trashy. I no longer listen to him for years. No one in my family does, anymore. Once you have to resort to vulgarity, you\u2019re nothing. Sally Q \\nNo, not all of us voted for this crap\u2026many of us either refused to vote (don\u2019t bother with the arguments\u2026), or voted for somebody such as Ron Paul\u2026the problems are not voting; the problems are the banking / corporate conglomerates and various multinational organizations such as the CFR that own the governments of most countries and are deliberately orchestrating these events. If you don\u2019t believe it, do some investigating into the Federal Reserve, the Rothschilds, the Bilderbergs, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations and other related people and organizations. Put it together and understand. Chris \\n\u201d the problems are the banking / corporate conglomerates and various multinational organizations such as the CFR that own the governments of most countries and are deliberately orchestrating these events\u201d You just made my point. Like I said in my original post, voting is the problem because the majority keep on voting for politicians who are in cahoots with corporate conglomerates, etc. theblues77 \\nExactly. You can\u2019t write an accurate article or frame the debate accurately without STARTING with NAFTA. bertinanth764 \\nmy Aunty Caroline got Buick Verano Sedan by working part time at home online. my latest blog post B\\xadi\\xadg\\xad2\\xad9\\xad.\\xad\u2102\\xado\\xadm GSOB \\ntroll John O\u2019Neill \\nAmen to all of that. It is not just Obama/Biden who caused much of this but it is the millions of Americans who voted for them and who still champion their affirmative action virtuous government. Americans brought this on themselves and as Mencken once said \u201cdemocracy is people getting what they deserve and getting it good and hard\u201d. Rufus T Firefly \\nDoes the Rolling Drone article point out that, like Detroit, Camden is a Democratic city that voted overhelmingly for Obama? They are getting the hellhole they deserve. WarriorClass III \\nCamden was 89 percent white in 1940 (104,842 out of 117,536 residents), and it was thriving. It attracted a steady flow of black migrants in search of jobs (that they didn\u2019t create, nor could they sustain). By 1980, the city was 53 percent black (45,009 out of 84,910 residents). Only 26,003 white people remained. \\nThis is how the city of Camden died \u2014 no more white residents paying the taxes or maintaining some form of civilization to support the city. Eventually, the same non-white population that overwhelmed Camden started to overwhelm the white suburbs surrounding the city. \\nDemography is destiny. \\nYou meant race is destiny. Mondobeyondo \\nRace.. is the 100 meter dash. 1stworlder \\nits inverse. The race that usually wins 100 meter dashes loses out at the math test at payday loan offices. luchia \\nYou are so correct warrior. I live in Camden on Erie St., in 1953. I was a great neighborhood. No crime, but petty stuff. We then moved to N. 24th St. No crime, except the petty. When I would go out and play, Mom would say, be home before dark, and at ages 8,9,10,11, etc., I was gone ALL day long. Couldn\u2019t call Mom either, no phone, oh also no cell phone (lol). Nice clean neighborhoods both of them. Then they build Abbott Village for the low income people and slowly the place deteriorated, it seem like wild fire, slowly thugs and people from Puerto Rico, blacks took over, and it went to crap. Once the whites moved out, it started to become what it is today. Drove thru there about 2 yrs. ago, it was disgusting. Sequoia \\nLos Angeles CA has also turned into a hellhole which is expanding to one day turn all of Southern California into one. Sonar \\nInland California is filled with bankrupt hellholes like Stockton and San Bernardino. Annette Smith \\nSo true, so true! Those of us who grew up there know this to be the absolute truth. Did you know that Los Angeles is filled with illiterate people? There was a news report on the amount of illegals there. So many, now that the whites have moved out, that they are the main population group in Los Angeles city\u2026and they are illiterate. Google it for the story. de malfosse \\nluchia; I also lived on Erie St until \u201969. There is no public acceptance of that which we witnessed. Hellfire1968 \\nBaltimore is the way and it is getting worse. k \\nThey shouldnt have been brought from africa then. Blame politicians, not people. JulietteofOhio \\nThere\u2019s not a lot we can do about that, now. Politicians didn\u2019t bring them, it was a business, and a very bad one, which has ongoing ramifications for all of us. We\u2019re still stuck trying to take care of them, and they\u2019re still busily biting the hand that feeds them. k \\nIts not the ones who are being fed, its the ones who arent. k \\nAnd businesses and politicians have been hand in hand since millenia. They are two sides of the same coin. Hammerstrike \\nWho elected the politicians? That\u00b4s right! \\nSome are more guilty than others but if you are looking for the guilty, you only need to look into a mirror! k \\nPeople elect politicians believing they will do something good. Now if politicians do something bad instead, its their fault not the peoples. The only other alternative is not to vote\u2026and a lot of people do that already. k \\nI dont know how i missed your comment. Kim \\nThis is racist. The failure of Camden and other us cities is connected to de-industrialization which can be connected to an even bigger cause, namely, peak oil in the United States in 1970. I\u2019m not talking about fracking potentials, but cheap, easily-recoverable oil with large investment to energy recovered ratios. After we drained our wells circa 1970, industrialization declined and the jobs (money) went away and the poor were left inhabiting places like Camden and Detroit. This has nothing to do with the color of anyone\u2019s skin. The only connection I see between race and poverty is lack of opportunity, and the governments refusal to be honest and manage the wind down of industry in a rational way. Eventually, we will all be living in similar Camdens, or worse. \\nThe weapons of mass instruction have done their damage. There are far more poor whites without opportunity than non-whites in America, yet it\u2019s the non-whites that are responsible for more than 80% of the crime. \\nThe ten most dangerous cities in America all have non-white majority populations, new FBI data has revealed. \\nThis not-so-surprising news is just the latest piece of evidence that emphasizes a clear correlation between increased non-white immigration and soaring crime figures. \\nRefer to The New Century Foundation\u2019s The Color of Crime (2005), an American report on the differences in crime rates by race. It found that: \\n\u2022 Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery. \\n\u2022 Hispanics commit violent crimes at roughly three times the white rate. \\n\u2022 Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent. \\n\u2022 Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery. \\n\u2022 Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes against whites than vice versa. \\n\u2022 Only 10 percent of youth gang members are white. \\n\u2022 Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs. Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely. \\n\u2022 Blacks are seven times more likely to be in prison than whites. Hispanics are three times more likely. \\nYou can keep making excuses for these people, but the facts don\u2019t change. The problems you mention affect us all, but it\u2019s the non-whites committing the crimes. Kim \\nDepends on where u live. I don\u2019t believe criminal behavior is oriented in one\u2019s racial DNA, just as I don\u2019t believe one is homosexuality in the womb and from birth. \\nEnvironment, social status, economic status, inequality, and culture play primary roles in adult behavior. \\nThen u have the added problem of substance abuse. \\nLet\u2019s take a comprehensive look at these statistical outcomes before we make conclusion that if you\u2019re born black or mexican you are destined to have an 80% more probability to commit a violent crime than your white counterparts. Until there is actually something isolated in the human genome pertaining to race and criminal behaviors, I   any reason to take a racist attitude toward crime. WarriorClass III \\nTo some extent it does seem to depend upon where you live. Minorities in Texas are less violent than in other parts of the country. Nevertheless they are still more violent than whites and there are far more whites that are subjected to adverse pressures with regard to the things you mention, like environment, social status, economic status, inequality, drug use and cultural issues. Overall, non-whites are more impulsive and violent and the strongest correlation is race rather than any other factor. This is just observation of the facts, not racism. Whites are not angels, but you don\u2019t see these problems in majority white cities and neighborhoods. Kim \\nIt could be cultural, intellectual and emotional as well. It is well known that Italians are hot tempered. Does that mean they are hot tempered BECAUSE they are Italian? Not necessarily, I am of English heritage mostly and my family is very even tempered. But we have our issues. GSOB \\nGood point Spain is the only Hispanic nation with more bookstores than woman/male donkey shows. Hammerstrike \\n\u201cMinorities in Texas are less violent than in other parts of the country.\u201d \\nEveryone is, because there are a lot of guns there! GSOB \\nP = Perseverance of the Saints 1stworlder \\nIQ has been proven to be at least 85% genetic. This plays out in choices like \u201cshould I take a 500+%APR payday loan\u201d or \u201cshould I rob a liquor store for $200, which could put me in prison, and prevent me from getting a job at a liquor store\u201d China towns have been some of the poorest neighborhoods in US history but had even less crime than white hoods. Asians are able to succeed because they evolved under similar circumstances as Europeans. Kim \\nOk, no way.

Studies have been done on identical twins separated at birth. The genes for IQ would give no advantage to people in an R style evolution set up where they have to outbreed diseases, High IQ only helps those evolving in K style evolution. If it was environmental 4th generation Hispanics would be able to compete with whites. Reality is what still exists when you stop believing in it. The avg IQ for east Asians is 106, whites 100, Mexicans 90, US/DR blacks 85 and African/Haiti blacks 70. Haiti and the Dominican Republic share a land mass but the avg IQs between the 2 is as great as US vs African blacks due to the histories of each side of the island.

Today, it is over 400,000 barrels, and North Dakota has become the fourth-largest oil-producing state in the country.

It was a city that thrived on industrialization and collapsed under its own weight when de-industrialization began, and the poor were left holding the bag. Race is so completely irrelevant in the collapse of Detroit and Camden, I find it bizarre that we are even discussing it. Just give it time, we will all be living in Camdens of our own soon enough.

Most of the smaller countries have always had these kind of percentages. Now the larger ones are heading down the same road. It is all part of a long term plan, and that plan is approaching the final chapter. Once this sort of plan would have never worked here, the people would have never stood for it. So perhaps this Country may be more educated than ever before. But it sure isn\u2019t as smart as it once was. kfilly \\nYeah, most that are educated are educated idiots.

Sadly not the only example of a lie turned into fact, especially not if you consider withholding the truth as a lie. \\nSo what about those who have rebellious thoughts, what happen to them? Well first of all there are no such things as revolutionaries in America, only terrorists. And such elements of society can of course be put in prison for as long as our masters seems fit, with or without any formal charges against them. Though, such measures are usually not necessary because everybody knows that people who speak against the American moddel are nutters, that is after all what the media constantly keeps telling us, and when the media is directly run by a selected few from the elite, can legally lie, and make sure to drown any kind of alternative opinions by constantly spamming the internett and our TV-screens with the same junk-news and zombifying entertainment day after day after day, it becomes pretty obvious why people end up rather compliant.

You\u2019re in the crosshairs. \\nCamden today, Des Moines tomorrow, Hellfire1968 \\nand Baltimore the next day. hero \\nI used to live in Philly & consider it my 2nd home. Whenever I rode PATCO & passed through Camden, I broke my heart looking at deserted homes & empty city blocks. Absolutely no economic activity & all I hear on Action News was about people going there to buy drugs. \\nIt is true\u2026When Blacks & Hispanics moved in, whole neighborhoods got destroyed & Camden never recovered from it. North Philly & West Philly are beginning to look like Camden but time will tell. Mondobeyondo \\nI\u2019ve never lived east of the Mississippi River. I do not know what life is like in New York City, or New Orleans, or Philly, Detroit, etc.Can\u2019t speak for those places. I\u2019ve HEARD of Cabrini Green, the Detroit projects, etc. Personal experience? Zero. \\nIs it really that bad in Philly? Because it\u2019s bad here in Phoenix, Arizona. If you are looking for the promised land, don\u2019t come here. You won\u2019t find it here. \\nPhoenix is suburbia gone berzerk; Las Vegas is suburbia gone berzerk with casinos. I live in one, been to the other often. Anonymous \\nNew Orleans does not look like it ever recovered from Hurricane Katrina. IMO it looks like a third world country now. NOLA used to be a beautiful city that could rival the beauty of Savannah. Now you don\u2019t want to go outside the tourist areas in NOLA or Savannah IMO. grumpyhillbilly \\nThe positives for Philadelphia is it has very good med schools and universities. Pharmaceutical companies do research with the med schools, but prefer to work outside the city There are a few posh neighborhood, but they are increasingly getting invaded by criminal. Other than that its a decaying dump. Get past the historical areas and center city, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve picked up the trash for years. By they \u2013 I mean the unioned city trash collectors. Kill a cop \u2013 you\u2019ll get swift justice, but don\u2019t bother that union for results in any other circumstances. Many buildings are crumbling. If you look at them side way you can still see there onetime grandeur. If it weren\u2019t for the state, Philadelphia would have likely been the first city to have declared bankruptcy. The schools are teetering on whatever collapse you can think of. But the city Democrat machine is doing quite well. As is the union leadership, despite their dwindling membership. Corruption is thriving. El Pollo de Oro \\nMondobeyondo: Philly is a tale of two cities. You have the crime-infested, dilapidated Philly (Kensington, North Philly, Germantown, Strawberry Mansion, Frankford), and you have the expensive gentrified areas that are full of yuppies with a Starbucks everywhere you turn. I know people here who are doing really well and others who are barely scraping by. Cities run by Democraps range from ultra-expensive places like Boston, San Francisco and Seattle to hellholes like Camden and Detroit, and Philly has both extremes. And such extremes are to be expected in a Third World country like the BRA. Sonar \\nMiddle class families have been largely priced out of San Francisco and Seattle. Both those cities have a small wealthy Democrat elite who run everything and a lot of poor and homeless people who are totally dependent on government handouts like welfare, food stamps and rent subsidies.

MeMadMax \\nWe paid for NAFTA and all the other so called \u201cfree trade\u201d agreements with out country\u2026 Rene Girrard \\nThanks Michale for posting another great article. I\u2019m afraid you are so right that the middle class is dying. Why is there no talk of this on the MSM or even internet news sites? A couple in their 50\u2019s just moved out right below me. They wanted to move to some place cheaper so they set u their 35-foot camper at an RV park just north of Ft. Worth. They are paying $300/month for the space, electric & water. It is far cheaper than what they were paying here at the extended stay hotel. There is also an article on Drudge now about people living in their RVs in NYC. I think this may be a trend in the future. smallergovnow \\nI\u2019m considering doing just that. sell my house, buy a fifth wheel trailer and piece of land in the country\u2026 Anonymous \\nWhen enough people do it, this too will become unaffordable. xander cross \\nFunny how all of the companies that was sold to other countries are were sold by white men. So once again, who exactly is sending the jobs to other countries? The answer is WHITE MEN. Guest \\nWelcome back sander floss! We missed you\u2026NOT!! xander cross \\nI see you yet again and of course, you cannot refute my statement. Sonar \\nWe see that you cannot substantiate your racist and bigoted comments. xander cross \\nPot, meet kettle. luchia \\nMaybe, they \u201cunionized\u201d themselves out of a job. The owner of a company, didn\u2019t want to pay union wages, got his goods made for cheaper outside the USA. Anonymous \\nYeah, who wants to pay those working class people a wage they can actually live on? How dare the workers form a union. How dare those workers demand humane working conditions and hours. Instead of forming unions, workers should have just jumped in front of their employer\u2019s gunfire at Blair Mountain. Instead of forming unions, workers should have just been quiet and and happy about the company heads that do little real work becoming billionaires off of other people\u2019s work and back. Meanwhile, employers have found a way to get free labor through internships and volunteering. \\nAmericans work more than any other industrialized country. Americans deserve to be paid for their time, hard work, and their backs. No single person at any company should be making 7+ figure salaries. Every employer screams \u201cWe are a team\u201d until it is time to cut the paychecks. Then, they pretend that some people on the team are less valuable than other people on the team. Malcolm Reynolds \\nIn case you didn\u2019t notice with all that leftist pap and whining, wages seem to be directly proportional to skills. \\nIf you\u2019re a moron whose job can be filled by basically calling out \u201cNEXT!\u201d, you can expect to make peanuts. If your job is very hard and there are very few of you, you can expect to make boat loads of money. \\nThis is called life honey boo boo. Now go flip a burger, make a buck. Snore! Anonymous \\nSo, are you suggesting a CEO should \u201cbe paid peanuts?\u201d What specific \u201cskills\u201d do those at the top of the food chain possess to justify their salary?

You make minimum wage doncha? DiscouragedOne \\nDo you have any actual experience and facts to base your conclusions on, or you ACTUALLY believe what is on reality shows is real. Man, this country is messed up! Anonymous \\nI guess it is better for employers to be allowed to treat workers any way they want to. Perhaps working conditions in the USA should be as they are in China; where some factories have had to place suicide nets to catch the workers that are so miserable they are flinging themselves out of the windows. Is that a better solution than workers forming unions? Malcolm Reynolds \\nBTW, you\u2019re clearly advocating a govt corporate blending, which is Fascism and is what currently exists in this country.. Gay Veteran \\nprofits are easy when you have slave labor in China MrsBulldoggy . \\nYou think all the evil in the world is perpetrated by white men? You are a racist, bigoted fool! There are many examples of narcissistic, evil murderers in this world that were not white: *Blacks in Rwanda committing mass genocide in 1994 (nothing to do with white men) *Pol Pot in the 1970\u2019s exterminating anyone who would not turn to communism in Cambodia (nothing to do with white men) *Kim Jong Un and Il starving and murdering their own people (nothing to do with white men) *Chairman Mao murdering 50 Million+ of his own Chinese people during the 20th century (nothing to do with white men) *Arabic Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran and other middle eastern and north African countries slaughtering non-muslims because they are infidels (has NOTHING to do with white men) The list goes on and on and on. Crimes against humanity have happened in history against all people of every color and creed by all people of every color and creed. Evil is not the sole domain of white men, evil comes in all shapes, sizes, colors, genders, religions, non-religions, creeds. To put forth otherwise makes one look like an illiterate fool that is spouting racist, bigoted rhetoric. BTW, you don\u2019t know if all these people are white or not, Xander. The wealthiest man on Earth right now is a MEXICAN (NOT WHITE MAN) named Carlos Slim. He has his hands in everything just like all the other wealthy men and women who are billionaires. Pull your head out of your southern orifice and get a clue\u2026 xander cross \\nI see you failed at reading. I never said all evil are perpetrated by white men. I said that white men sent the jobs to china for over 30 years and still do so to this very day. So, white men are the problem. MrsBulldoggy . \\nNo, Xander you fail at logic and critical reasoning. You have problems, seriously, Xander. Mental health issues that I do not wish to deal with nor am I qualified to handle. I just feel sorry for you and your insane, inane and seriously deranged rantings and ravings. Nothing else to say except God Bless and get some help as soon as you can. xander cross \\nI feel that you\u2019re going to need help when white men finish sending the jobs and resources to china and then send them water resources as well.

The fact that you know that your medicine companies are sold to china now, suggest to me that you need mental help. xander cross \\nEvery company that Michael has listed was sold by white men. So once again, white men are the ones that sending the jobs to China for greed. So, this proves to me that white men turned china into an economic superpower. luchia \\nMaybe, they got sick and tired of dealing with all the union b.s. Malcolm Reynolds \\nracist. xander cross \\nSo who exactly sold all of the jobs to china then? The answer would be white men. Malcolm Reynolds \\nThink deeper.
