So I remember the day this one couple came in. They arrived at the courthouse well dressed. The husband was large and stocky, and the wife was in slacks and a blouse, thin and   with curly hair and a delicate face. She looked frightened. I typed as the prosecutor laid out the details of the case. They were each  . They owned a farm outside town. The wife had gone to church without her husband\u2019s permission. When the husband found out, he went to the church and dragged her out by the hair. He took her home, forced her onto their bed, hit her and began to squeeze her neck. Luckily one of their children showed up at the house just then and interrupted him. He might have choked her to death. Then it was time for the wife to speak. \u201cIt was my fault, your honor,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask his permission to go to church. \u201d That\u2019s when I said to myself: This poor woman is exactly how I used to be. When I was in high school, I met and fell in love with a schoolmate. He was religious and hardworking. He didn\u2019t drink, and he belonged to a good family. Even though my mother didn\u2019t approve  \u2014   she scolded me for going out to see him  \u2014   I left school and moved in with him. We married and had three children very quickly. Then, when I was 21, after my youngest was born, I wanted to go back to high school. I didn\u2019t want to keep washing dishes and doing housework forever. Married women were allowed to go only to night classes, but I wanted to study during the day with the regular students. O. K. the teacher said, but you have to wear the uniform. It\u2019s a pleated blue skirt with a white shirt tucked in, the blue and white for the flag of Nicaragua, with these long white socks up to the knee. My youngest was only 3 months old, and I was still nursing. Sometimes my breasts filled up and leaked through my uniform. I didn\u2019t care. But my husband did. He didn\u2019t want me to go back to school. He said that married women were supposed to stay home, taking care of the children and doing house chores, and that the ones who wanted to study were sluts  \u2014   what they do is look for men. He was no longer the person I met now he cursed and went out drinking. He began to treat me badly. But I couldn\u2019t leave. By then my mother was barely getting by, and there was no one else  \u2014   no friends or family members  \u2014   to help support me or my kids. Too bad, I told myself. I\u2019ll just have to endure it. My husband tried to stop me from studying any way he could. One day he showed up at school to spy on me. Other times he got my uniform dirty or tore up my notebooks. I would buy new ones and copy my assignments all over again. He would tear them up again, and I\u2019d copy them again. He got bored of it before I did. Finally I finished high school, and I wanted to go to university. My husband refused to give me the money, even for a notebook. I heard that the courthouse was looking for someone to mop the floors and clean the shutters. I wasn\u2019t even an official employee. The judges paid me 300 c\u00f3rdobas a month (about $20 at the time) out of their own salaries. My husband was furious about it. In calmer moments, he would try to reason with me: \u201cWhy do you need to work when I provide everything you need? The rice, the beans, everything?\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be a housewife,\u201d I told him. \u201cI want to be something. \u201d With the money I earned cleaning, I got my bachelor\u2019s degree in social studies. Then I began to clean a second courthouse, so that was 600 c\u00f3rdobas a month. When the two courts eventually merged, they hired me as the custodian officially. Some time later, my boss, a woman, encouraged me to study law. It was only after I became a lawyer several years ago that I started earning enough money to support myself and my kids on my own. Finally I didn\u2019t have to put up with this man anymore. So I divorced him. Now, in the hearing, I looked at this wife. The judge, who was a woman, said to her: \u201cYou have to ask permission to go to church?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d the wife said. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d the judge said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to ask for permission. We\u2019re not the property of anybody. \u201d But I knew how hard it would be for the woman to learn what, after so long, I finally understood.'"}, "time": 1742563180.40048}
