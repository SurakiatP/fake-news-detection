This should not be happening. There is no way in the world that there should be a 14 point difference between scientific polls at this stage in the game. On November 8th the polling organizations that were way off are going to be exposed, and it will be exceedingly difficult for them to regain their credibility afterwards. At this point, some of the largest news organizations in the country are openly projecting a Clinton landslide. For example, Reuters says that Clinton now has a 95 percent chance of winning \u2026 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is on a definite path to the White House, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation poll. The survey, released Saturday, found that Clinton is on track to win more than 300 votes in the Electoral College, which would solidly secure her the presidency. If the election were held this week, Clinton would win 326 Electoral College votes while Trump would win only 212, the poll said. According to Reuters, Clinton currently has a 95 percent chance of winning the White House . If Reuters isn\u2019t right about this they are going to end up looking awfully foolish. An analysis by the Associated Press also has Clinton as the overwhelming favorite. And it is true that the poll results coming out of individual states seem to show Clinton with a seemingly insurmountable lead on the electoral map . But once again, can we trust those polls? Trump has regularly dismissed the national polls, but on Sunday his campaign manager did admit on national television that they are losing. The following comes from the New York Post \u2026 Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager on Sunday acknowledged something her boss hates to do \u2014 losing. \u201cWe are behind,\u201d Kellyanne Conway admitted on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The GOP nominee routinely brushes off negative polling as untrustworthy but Conway said Democrat Hillary Clinton does have an edge. However, it is important to remember that the big national polls have been very wrong in the past. Back in 1980, a Gallup survey that was released on October 26th showed Ronald Reagan trailing Jimmy Carter by 8 points, but of course Reagan went on to win the election by a landslide \u2026 \u201cFor weeks before the presidential election, the gurus of public opinion polling were nearly unanimous in their findings,\u201d wrote John F. Stacks for TIME in April 1980. \u201cIn survey after survey, they agreed that the coming choice between President Jimmy Carter and challenger Ronald Reagan was \u2018too close to call.\u2019 A few points at most, they said, separated the two major contenders. \u201cBut when the votes were counted, the former California Governor had defeated Carter by a margin of 51% to 41% in the popular vote \u2014 a rout for a U.S. presidential race. In the electoral college, the Reagan victory was a 10-to-1 avalanche that left the President holding only six states and the District of Columbia.\u201d Could a similar thing happen on November 8th? Without a doubt, Trump supporters are far more enthusiastic than Clinton supporters are, and that matters. The key on election day is to get your voters to turn out in large numbers, and the fact that Donald Trump is drawing record crowds to his rallies is a very good sign. But even if Donald Trump legitimately wins the election, it could still be stolen from him via election fraud. In recent days Democrats have been playing down the idea that this could possibly happen, but the truth is that even Barack Obama has admitted that election fraud is a major problem in the past. For instance, just consider what he said about this back in 2008 \u2026 \u201cWell, I tell you what it helps in Ohio, that we got Democrats in charge of the machines,\u201d Obama said regarding the threat of election-rigging. He continued, \u201cWhenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to tilt things in their direction. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to have, I believe, a voting rights division in the Justice Department that is nonpartisan, and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we need paper trails on these new electronic machines so that you actually have something that you can hang on to after you\u2019ve punched that letter\u2014make sure it hasn\u2019t been hacked into,\u201d he added, admitting that even Democrats have \u201cmonkeyed around\u201d with election results: \u201cI want to be honest, it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes, Democrats have, too.\u201d I know that these comments almost sound too good to be true, but you can actually watch video of Obama making these comments right here . And it is odd that he specifically mentioned Democrats having control of the voting machines in Ohio, because I documented extreme voting irregularities in Ohio in the last election during a recent visit to Morningside . And an increasing number of Americans are starting to become concerned about election fraud. In fact, a brand new Reuters survey found that 70 percent of Republicans believe that if Hillary Clinton wins the election it will be \u201c because of illegal voting or vote rigging\u201d. So even if Hillary Clinton gets into the White House, she may find that she has an exceedingly difficult time trying to govern the nation. A lot of people have made a lot of predictions about the outcome of this election, and we don\u2019t have very long until we find out who was right and who was wrong. At this point, voting has already begun in many states, and the early results in Nevada don\u2019t look encouraging for the Trump campaign \u2026 According to the estimable Nevada journalist Jon Ralston , Democrats have a 20-percentage-point turnout edge so far based on early and absentee voting in Clark County (home to Las Vegas), Nevada. And they have a 10-point edge in Washoe County (home to Reno). But in the key swing state of Florida, so far 498,153 Republicans have voted compared to just 478,175 Democrats . So that would seem to be some very good news for the Trump campaign, because Trump cannot win without carrying the state of Florida . To me it seems as though Americans are more emotionally invested in this campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign in decades. The stakes are incredibly high, and in just over two weeks we will find out what happens. Let us just hope and pray that America makes the right choice.
