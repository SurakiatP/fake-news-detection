Young\u2019s review in The Mail, in which he described Loach\u2019s representation of common DWP practices such as delaying appeals and giving out benefit sanctions for minor errors as \u201cfar fetched\u201d, was met with anger and incredulity in online forums. However, many of the claimants who were involved in researching the film have simply denied that Young was even real. \\nSaid Sarah, 41, who claims ESA for chronic Parkinson\u2019s and has been forced to make several appeals, \u201cToby Young simply doesn\u2019t ring true. We\u2019re meant to believe that he\u2019s a journalist, but he\u2019s more of a lefty\u2019s version of what a Daily Mail reviewer ought to be like. Where is the research, the information? I can\u2019t really believe that journalism\u2019s that bad, it just isn\u2019t credible.\u201d Jack, 47, who has been sanctioned twice on JSA, was more forthright: \u201cThis is a fraud. Everyone knows that it\u2019s easy to impersonate a journalist and the idea that this so-called \u201cToby Young\u201d, if that is what he\u2019s really called, bears any resemblance to how things are on the ground is simply ludicrous\u201d. \\nThe Daily Mail have hit back, saying Toby Young was \u201cthe genuine article\u201d and that \u201cif we didn\u2019t give an outlet to marginalised Oxbridge graduates with appalling senses of entitlement, then there was a real danger that their voices might be drowned out by the cries of the needy and the vulnerable\u201d. Mental health campaigners have also responded angrily, saying that Young was \u201cclearly delusional\u201d, needing \u201chelp rather than disbelief\u201d. The DWP have refused to get involved in the row and, when asked to comment, a spokesman merely spat on the ground and gave me a piecing stare. andyiong'"}, "time": 1742563267.625394}
