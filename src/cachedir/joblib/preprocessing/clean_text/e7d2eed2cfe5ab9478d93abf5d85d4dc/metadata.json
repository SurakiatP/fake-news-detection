In the nearly   ad  \u2014   titled \u201cLive for Now Moments Anthem\u201d  \u2014   Jenner is pictured on a modeling shoot in New York City when a sizable crowd of protesters streams past holding signs and demonstrating in the streets. Soon, Jenner takes off her blonde wig and joins the protesters, who appear to be styled after   Trump \u201cresistance\u201d demonstrators. The model steps through the crowd holding a can of Pepsi, which she then hands to one of the police officers watching the protest the officer accepts the can, to the loud cheers of everyone in the streets.  The spurred a widespread backlash online, particularly among progressives and social justice activists, with hundreds of social media users weighing in with mostly negative feedback as \u201cPepsi\u201d began trending on Twitter Tuesday afternoon. Some critics took aim at the ad\u2019s apparent suggestion that sharing a soda with a police officer could end racial discrimination, while others  \u2014   including comedian Patton Oswalt  \u2014   joked about the soda\u2019s mythical   qualities. Below is a sampling of social media reaction to the ad. A representative for Pepsi did not immediately return a request for comment. Idk how appropriation of today\u2019s protesting can be thought of as a good idea, yea just hand the cops a Pepsi and racial profiling will end!  \u2014   Rory Fitzpatrick\u265b (@StopRory) April 4, 2017,  J.
