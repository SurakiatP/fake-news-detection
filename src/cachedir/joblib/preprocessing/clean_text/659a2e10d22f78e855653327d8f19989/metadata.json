He had not long completed his final album written about the US election called 'You want it darker' which now will become historically famous as a work of astonishing prescience. \\nHe is best remembered for his magnificent song Hallelujah and his 60's 'tell it like it is sister' lyrics which inspired people to understand the voices in their own heart and not to project hatred upon others. \\nWho could ever forget KD Lang singing that song at the Montreal Olympics, it was the highlight of the games. \\nRIP to a great man, may his message that is needed ever more now resonate in the hearts of all, especially those that see pubescent hatred as a valid way of relating to the world.
