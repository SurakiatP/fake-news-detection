Previous readings were taken in late October in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 campaigns. In those years, between 52% and 61% of registered voters said the two major-party candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities \u2014 a sharp contrast to Trump\u2019s current 32%. Clinton\u2019s rating of 51% is one percentage point below the previous low score. \\nClinton\u2019s score, while low, was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to 2000. Trump\u2019s score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll. \\nVoters aren\u2019t going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership. The popular vote total in 2016 may reflect the nation\u2019s political polarization, but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the Democratic candidate. \\nDonald Trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate. He doesn\u2019t look, act, or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the Oval Office and lead the United States of America. \\nThe last week before election day tension that is in the air is normal, but the fundamental motivating factors of this contest haven\u2019t changed. Democrats are holding on to their electoral map advantage, while Donald Trump has become the central issue and question on the ballot. \\nRepublicans look to be heading for a major ballot box disaster because voters do not believe that Donald Trump is fit to be president.'"}, "time": 1742563091.6742363}
