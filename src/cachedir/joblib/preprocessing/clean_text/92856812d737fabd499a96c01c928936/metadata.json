Now, it faces one of its biggest challenges yet, in the form of a fellow chocolate giant eager to strike a big takeover deal. In rebuffing a $23 billion offer from Mondelez International, whose own products run from Oreo cookies to Cadbury chocolate, Hershey is betting that it can stay on its own, or at least fetch a substantially higher price. But flatly rejecting Mondelez\u2019s offer will be a major test of Hershey\u2019s historically impregnable defense: the charitable trust that effectively wields control. The offer, made in a letter on June 23 after months of    discussions between the two companies, would make a blockbuster merger in a year that has been sorely lacking in hugely prominent deals. Moreover, it is a bold move by Mondelez at a time when other   deal makers have grown more cautious in the face of uncertain winds in the marketplace and the economy. Mondelez\u2019s move has also raised questions about whether other food companies will seek to make their own run at Hershey  \u2014   or whether Mondelez itself may be put into play. After the activist investor William A. Ackman took a big stake in Mondelez nearly a year ago, speculation emerged that he would push for a sale, possibly to Kraft Heinz. Mondelez, cleaved from what once was Kraft, has offered $107 a share in cash and stock, a 10 percent premium to Hershey\u2019s closing stock price on Wednesday. Hershey, however, said on Thursday that its board had \u201crejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondelez and the company. \u201d Mondelez declined to comment. Hershey would represent the biggest takeover by Mondelez since its former parent bought Cadbury of Britain in a $19 billion deal more than six years ago. That transaction, too, took time, and Cadbury initially rebuffed the American food behemoth\u2019s advances. Pursuing Hershey is a different matter. A trust holds about 8. 4 percent of the candy maker\u2019s shares, but has about 81 percent of the company\u2019s voting power. The shares of the company  \u2014   both the common and the special Class B shares  \u2014   are owned by the Milton Hershey School Trust, but are voted on by the Hershey Trust. The Milton Hershey School was founded in 1909 for underprivileged children by the company\u2019s founder and his wife. The trust has flexed its muscle several times over in the last two decades. When the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company wanted to buy Hershey at a 42 percent premium in 2002, the trust called off the sale at the last minute. When the trust became unhappy with Hershey\u2019s performance and deal talks with Cadbury in 2007, it asked for the resignation of six directors. And when Hershey wanted to challenge Kraft for Cadbury in 2010, a rift between the company and the trust forced the Pennsylvania chocolatier to bow out. The trust has already retained advisers separate from the Hershey Company itself as it weighs its own options. To make matters even more complicated, Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general, who oversees charitable trusts in the state, has raised concerns over the Hershey trust\u2019s administration of its funds and called for an overhaul of its board. Any turnover could alter the dynamics of the percolating takeover contest. Mondelez has been mindful of winning over the trust. In its letter last week, it promised to maintain jobs and relocate the combined company\u2019s chocolate operations to Hershey, Pa. Mondelez even offered to erase its name  \u2014   reportedly born from a Kraft employee\u2019s contribution to a rebranding effort  \u2014   in favor of the   Hershey name. Putting the two together would yield a powerful force in the business of sweets. Mondelez, which was spun off from Kraft in 2012, is the world\u2019s   confectionery company  \u2014   but it has very little business in the United States. Hershey, on the other hand, has more than   of its sales in North America. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprising move, but it does make sense for Mondelez,\u201d said Jack Skelly, a food analyst with Euromonitor. Additionally, Hershey owns the rights to make and market Cadbury chocolate  \u2014   but not other candies  \u2014   in America, and it took legal action to stop imports of Cadbury chocolates made abroad. (At the same time, Hershey manufactures KitKat bars, one of the most popular brands around, under a license from Nestl\u00e9. Should Mondelez prevail, it is unclear whether that agreement would change.) Both companies have improved profitability in the last several years and moved into sexier corners of the food business. Hershey, for instance, bought Krave and got into the increasingly popular jerky business. Mondelez bought Enjoy Life Foods, testing the market for   products. But the company has come under pressure from activist investors in recent years, including the billionaire Nelson Peltz, as well as Mr. Ackman. Rising cocoa prices have made the chocolate business less profitable, and it\u2019s hard to raise sales of chocolate in the United States, the world\u2019s largest consumer of chocolate. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s difficult to generate sales because people are starting to think of chocolate as an unhealthy product,\u201d noted Mr. Skelly of Euromonitor. Mars, which is privately held, is the world\u2019s largest confectionery company, followed by Mondelez. The others in the top five are Nestl\u00e9, the Ferrero Group and Hershey. As of Wednesday\u2019s close, before word of Mondelez\u2019s bid emerged, Hershey\u2019s market value was about $21 billion, while Mondelez\u2019s stood at $69 billion. Shares of Hershey climbed over 16 percent, to $113. 49. Shares of Mondelez rose nearly 6 percent, to $45. 51.'"}, "time": 1742562176.1489515}
