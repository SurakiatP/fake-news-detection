[\u201cIt\u2019s really been the most flattering thing,\u201d the    San Andreas star said in response to media reports that suggested he would make a good president.  When asked why he thinks he would make a good president, Johnson laughed off the question, and said he had never said that. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would make a good president,\u201d he added. \u201cI know that I have a certain skill set, and I think it\u2019s in that skill set that people see, and that people would want me to run. And I also think that\u2019s reflective of them wanting to see a better leadership happening right now. \u201d \u201dI don\u2019t know if I would make a good President, but I know I have a certain skill set  \u2026    \u201d  \u2014   Dwayne @TheRock Johnson on running for President pic. twitter.   \u2014   Good Morning America (@GMA) May 18, 2017,  Johnson, who went by the moniker The Rock in his pro wrestling days, first discussed the \u201creal possibility\u201d he could run for president in an interview with GQ this month. \u201cA year ago, it started coming up more and more,\u201d Johnson told GQ. \u201cThere was a real sense of earnestness, which made me go home and think \u2018Let me really rethink my answer and make sure I am giving an answer that is truthful and also respectful. \u2019\u201d While not much is known about Johnson\u2019s policy positions, the actor is reportedly a registered Republican, and has voiced his opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s executive actions on immigration from some   countries. \u201cI completely disagree with it,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cI believe in our national security to the core, but I don\u2019t believe in a \u2018ban\u2019 that bans immigrants. I believe in inclusion. Our country was built on that, and it continues to be made strong by that. And the decision felt like a snap judgment. I feel like the majority of, if not all, Americans feel that protection is of huge importance,\u201d he said. In his interview with GMA, Johnson was asked whether his presidential slogan might me \u201cMake America Rock Again. \u201d \u201cIt would be, right now, for Good Morning America, yes,\u201d Johnson said with a laugh.
