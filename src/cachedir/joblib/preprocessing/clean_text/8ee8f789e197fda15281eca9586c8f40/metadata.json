Jaws: Come on now, it\u2019s \u201cJaws. \u201d Raiders!: The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made: (Sept. 16) Over the course of seven years in the 1980s, three Mississippi kids filmed a remake of \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark. \u201d Every shot, every scene  \u2014   except for one. This light documentary tells the story of the film, the friends who made it and how they regrouped decades later to shoot the film\u2019s explosive airplane fight. Zootopia (Sept. 20): One of the year\u2019s biggest   hits, this Disney animated film layers a light mystery on top of a world in which predators and prey live side by side. Some have seen it as a fairly obvious message movie, but all can agree that it has one of filmed entertainment\u2019s greatest D. M. V. scenes. (A small category, to be sure.) Also recommended: \u201cMan on Wire,\u201d \u201cSaving Private Ryan,\u201d \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d (Sept. 28).

The Others: Nicole Kidman stars as a mother caring for her two kids on the lonely British isle of Jersey while her husband is off fighting in World War II. The family members suspect their house might be haunted. \u201cThe Others\u201d will appeal to those who like Gothic horror, ghost stories and horror films that don\u2019t overly rely on cheap jump scares. The Talented Mr. Ripley: These actors in their youth  \u2014   Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Jude Law, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchett. Beautiful clothes, beautiful Italian locales. Set in the 1950s. Murder. A sophisticated thriller for adults. Roman Holiday: Audrey Hepburn in her youth. Beautiful clothes, beautiful Roman locales. Filmed in the 1950s. No murder. A sophisticated romantic drama. Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension (Sept 3): O. K. look, I\u2019m not going to tell you this is a good movie. But if you are a completist and have seen the previous films in this series (including \u201cParanormal Activity: The Marked Ones\u201d a. k. a. \u201cParanormal Activity: Latino Edition\u201d) just get it over with and watch this one already. The Beatles: Eight Days a Week  \u2014   The Touring Years (Sept. 17): I\u2019ve not seen this documentary yet, but it\u2019s directed by Ron Howard. I like the Beatles, maybe you like the Beatles. So, let\u2019s watch. Sicario (Sept. 23): Starring Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt, this is a grim thriller about the drug war along the United   border. The film is less action packed than it is moody, tense and visually striking (Listen to this track from the score for a taste of the film\u2019s feel.) Also recommended: \u201c1984,\u201d \u201cAmerican Psycho,\u201d \u201cDirty Rotten Scoundrels,\u201d \u201cEight Men Out,\u201d \u201cThe French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman,\u201d \u201cGet Shorty,\u201d \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate,\u201d \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d \u201cLeaving Las Vegas,\u201d \u201cThe Purple Rose of Cairo,\u201d \u201cRed Dawn,\u201d \u201cThe Secret of N. I. M. H. \u201d Of note  \u2014   On Sept. 18, the following CW shows will be leaving Hulu: \u201cThe 100,\u201d \u201cArrow,\u201d \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cContainment,\u201d \u201cCrazy \u201d \u201cDC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow,\u201d \u201cThe Flash,\u201d \u201ciZombie,\u201d \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d \u201cThe Originals,\u201d \u201cReign,\u201d \u201cSupernatural,\u201d \u201cThe Vampire Diaries. \u201d Man on Wire: When the elfin French tightrope walker Philippe Petit strung a wire between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974 and strolled back and forth, it was a feat both inspirational and  . But, as portrayed in this 2008 film, getting to that point was like planning and orchestrating a great heist. A genuinely exciting documentary. The Witch (Sept. 17): In   Massachusetts, a family exiled from a local community tries to make a go of it on the edge of a forest. But misery befalls them. Is a witch to blame? (Probably. The movie\u2019s called \u201cThe Witch. \u201d) One of the best horror movies of the year, this should nonetheless be watched only if you\u2019re patient and adventurous. It\u2019s slow and everyone speaks in   English, so unless you have the subtitles on, you\u2019ll miss a third of what is being said. It\u2019s a film full of more dread than frights. Jiro Dreams of Sushi (Sept. 19): A beautiful documentary about an octogenarian chef making some of the best sushi in the world in a three star Michelin restaurant located in a Tokyo subway station. David Gelb, creator of Netflix\u2019s \u201cChef\u2019s Table,\u201d directed this film, which sometimes feels like a prequel to that series  \u2014   both are full of classical music and   cinematography. Also recommended: \u201c1984,\u201d \u201cApollo 13,\u201d \u201cBronson,\u201d \u201cCaddyshack,\u201d \u201cEight Men Out,\u201d \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate,\u201d \u201cInterview With a Vampire,\u201d \u201cRoman Holiday,\u201d \u201cThe Secret of N. I. M. H.,\u201d \u201cParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension\u201d (Sept. 3) \u201cSicario\u201d (Sept. 23). Ghost World: Is this the most underrated comic book movie? (Next to \u201cThe Rocketeer\u201d or \u201cDredd? \u201d) Based on the cartoonist Daniel Clowes\u2019s 1990s alternative comics, \u201cGhost World\u201d stars a young Scarlett Johansson and a  \u201dAmerican Beauty\u201d Thora Birch as two acerbic teenagers who spend the summer after high school graduation floating around town and mocking everything around them. Steve Buscemi plays the older man who, also feeling like an outcast, becomes their friend. Children of Men: This dark   thriller imagines a future in which humanity has lost the ability to bear children. As one of the few stable nations left on the planet, Britain has enacted strict   laws and is flooded with refugees. Theo (Clive Owen) comes across what may be the first pregnant woman in almost 20 years and must transport her to safety. Like they did in \u201cGravity,\u201d (though sans  ) the director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki construct a handful of tense sequences. The Revenant (Sept. 17) and Steve Jobs (Sept. 24): These movies came out less than a year ago and one of them won a few Academy Awards. You know about them and you know whether or not you want to see them. Both are HBO premieres, so they\u2019ll begin streaming on HBO GO and HBO Now on their respective Saturday nights. Also recommended: \u201c300,\u201d \u201cMichael Clayton,\u201d \u201cRushmore,\u201d \u201cThe Great Muppet Caper,\u201d \u201cThe English Patient\u201d (Sept. 2).
