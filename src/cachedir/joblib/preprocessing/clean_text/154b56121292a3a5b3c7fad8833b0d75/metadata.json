The former agent, who has chosen to maintain his anonymity, said that he was first introduced to the extraterrestrial quandary in the late 1950s.\\n\u201cI was coming into the Army fresh off the farm, so I really didn\u2019t have much knowledge of anything, so my boss filled me in on Project Blue Book and what they had found so far concerning Greys and aliens and the Roswell incident.\u201d \\nThe secrecy of his mission was of the utmost importance, so the ex-CIA agent was forbidden from disclosing any details pertaining to his line of work, not even to his family. He claimed he was coerced into vowing he would not speak of this subject for a period of 50 years. That time interval ended in 2010, prompting the aging man to spill the beans. What he reveals is a complex mass of cover-ups leading all the way up to the highest governmental positions.\\nOn one occasion, he recalls his superior being instructed by president Eisenhower to fly over to Area 51, find whoever was in charge and demand that he reported to Washington. The activity over there was so anomalous that even the chief of state was in the dark.\\nThe information revealed by the former agent is on par with Bob Lazar\u2019s disclosure of the S4 facility and the activities that took place at the base.\\n\u201cThey had different garage door openings and in these openings they had different saucer crafts. The very first one had the Roswell craft in. It was kind of crashed up but apparently every alien that was in it died except for a couple.\u201d \\nHe describes the Roswell craft as a \u201creally strange\u201d UFO that looked like it was made up of \u201creally heavy aluminum foil.\u201d It only weighed around 150 to 300 pounds and the propulsion system was most likely antigravitic.\\nDuring the same visit, the CIA operatives witnessed a film showcasing the autopsy of one of the crash victims. But there were also live aliens being kept at S4 and his supervisor was allowed to participate in the interviewing of one such creature.\\nThe agent described the alien as looking \u2018oriental\u2019, with a small body, a disproportionately-large head, large eyes and with small slits instead of ears.\\n\\nThere\u2019s no way the CIA agents confused the UFOs they saw with whatever secret aircraft was being developed at that time. Following their visit to the S4 facility, the CIA agents also traveled to Area 51, located several miles north. There they saw the U2 spy plane, which of course, they didn\u2019t know existed, but it was more than obvious that this was man-made while the other crafts clearly weren\u2019t.\\nAfterwards, the CIA agent and his superior officer flew back to Washington, where they debriefed President Eisenhower on the situation. Richard Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover were also present.\\n\u201cHe [Eisenhower] was totally shocked. He appeared for the first time to be worried.\u201d\\nThe former agent\u2019s admissions came at a cost, though. A short while after speaking with UFO investigator Linda Moulton Howe, he was apprehended by the Men in Black.\\n\u201cI was going to a grocery store when two guys in black suits came out of a black Lincoln Town Car and came over to see me. They told me that I\u2019d better not publish anything or talk to Linda about any more things.\u201d \\nThey succeeded in intimidating him. But that was before the interview below took place. As an old man whose time is almost up, the former CIA operative felt he should ignore their warning and disclose what he knew.\\n\\n\u201cI feel much better having talked about it,\u201d he told Richard Dolan. \u201cI kind of feel like there\u2019s a load off my shoulders because I have an awful lot of secrets I\u2019ve kept over the years.\u201d\\nMore than 50 years have passed since the events described by the CIA agent took place. Nowadays, more and more people believe we\u2019re on the brink of disclosure. Some even speculate that President Obama will take up this mission before leaving the White House or by the end of the year.\\nThat is also the opinion of U.S. lobbyist Steve Bassett, director of the Paradigm Research Group and the only official UFO disclosure lobbyist in the United States. He is convinced the White House has known about the existence of extraterrestrials for several decades now. It\u2019s about time the rest of the world knew.\\n\u201cET is real, we have got beyond that,\u201d Bassett said. \u201cWe are going to get disclosure this year. I am not sure who will win the election, but I think Obama will be the disclosure president. He will be looking at a Nobel Prize for making an announcement like that. I am 85 per cent sur Obama will make the announcement before he leaves office and within days the [United Kingdom\u2019s] Prime Minister will follow. I am trying to force Obama to make the disclosure. I think we are going to get there,\u201d he added.\\nLately, there\u2019s been much talk of disclosure.\\nLeaked e-mails between former chief of staff John Podesta and astronaut Edgar Mitchell show that the two were planning to arrange a meeting with Obama to discuss releasing the truth from custody .\\n\u201cFive decades of UFO information have dramatically shifted the public awareness of an extraterrestrial presence,\u201d Mitchell wrote. \u201cAnd yet, our government is still operating from outdated beliefs and policies. These are detrimental to trust in government transparency, science, religion and responsible citizenry embracing the next step in our country\u2019s space travel and research.\u201d\\nThe former astronaut was one of the biggest proponents of alien life and his death in February of 2016 was a blow for the pro-disclosure community. But it looks like we might have a chance at winning this.\\nIn an interview with CNN, Podesta let the world know that it\u2019s high time the government \u201creleased any evidence\u201d of alien life.\\n\\n\u201cThe U.S. government could do a much better job in answering the quite legitimate questions that people have about what\u2019s going on with unidentified aerial phenomena.\u201d\\nHeck, even the Vatican\u2019s on board with disclosure . Huh, who would\u2019ve thought it possible?\\nIn 2015, Father Jose Funes, the Pope\u2019s chief astronomer said that the Vatican believed life on other planets is not only possible, but highly likely. Furthermore, he stated that the existence of aliens does not contradict the Bible or the Christian belief system.\\n\u201cThe Bible is not a scientific book,\u201d Funes said. \u201cIf we look for scientific responses to our questions in the Bible, we are making a mistake. It answers great questions like \u2018what is our role in the Universe?\u2019\u201d\\nStill don\u2019t believe in the upcoming disclosure? Good, that means you\u2019re prepared for anything.\\nSource: UFOholic \\n'"}, "time": 1742562805.1277745}
