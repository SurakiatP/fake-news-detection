[These days, Hollywood seemingly revels in putting out films that bask in their own celebration of immorality and \u201cprogressive\u201d ideology and even when a film seems appropriate, or even features positive messaging, there\u2019s a good chance that many of the actors in it have used their elevated visibility to rail against many of the values and beliefs that conservatives hold dear.  A brief glance at the recent Academy Awards confirms that the Hollywood \u201cindustry\u201d is a mess even when the Oscars get the Best Picture winner right, many of the stars in attendance literally wear their support for   organizations like Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union on their sleeves. Thankfully, the modern miracle of the VHS tape, the DVD, and later, the   disc, have mitigated the need for a trip to the theater but even now, it can be difficult to decide which films best align with our conservative values. With that said, here are seven timeless film classics that resonate with positive messages that affirm the virtues that made America great  \u2014   and can be watched any time to avoid   of Girls. (Note: Not all of these films are suitable for children. Also, the films are listed in no particular order.)   1.   (1959) William Wyler\u2019s 1959 masterpiece won a staggering 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects and Best Actor for leading man Charlton Heston. Don\u2019t let the      runtime discourage you Heston is masterful as Judah   the Jewish prince who is sold into slavery and seeks revenge in this adaptation of Lew Wallace\u2019s 1880 novel  : A Tale of the Christ. With a $15 million budget,   was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its production, and to this day features one of the most stunningly shot and elaborately choreographed race sequences in the history of cinema. The film was remade for a third time (Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s 1925 silent film was the first) in 2016 with Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell in the leading roles, but fared poorly at the box office. Simply put, this story will never be put to film as spectacularly as it was in 1959. Wyler\u2019s   makes our list not only because it is a deeply moving religious masterpiece based on a famous Christian novel, but also because this 1959 film was a subtle affirmation of the newly created state of Israel. Among the film\u2019s powerful themes was Judah  \u2019s belief in a sovereign nation for the Jewish people. He famously tells his nemesis Messala, \u201cI believe in the past of my people, and in their future. \u201d Messala taunts him by calling the Jews a \u201cconquered people,\u201d saying, \u201cThe glory of Solomon is gone! Do you think it will return? Joshua will not rise again to save you, nor David!\u201d But Judah\u2019s response confidently predicts the ultimate victory of his   people: \u201cYou may conquer the land. You may slaughter the people. But that is not the end. We will rise again!\u201d Later, during the film\u2019s famous chariot race, Judah proudly wears a Star of David medal pinned to his chest and wraps himself in a blue cloak like the color of the Israeli flag. The film\u2019s sympathetic treatment of Jewish history reminds modern audiences that Israel has been the rightful home of the Jewish people since ancient times. And today   is also a poignant reminder that once upon a time, Hollywood was unabashedly  .  \u2014   D. N. 2. Braveheart (1995) Mel Gibson pulled double duty in his 1995 magnum opus Braveheart, both directing and starring in the     war epic, for which he earned a Best Director Oscar and Best Picture. Gibson plays 13th century Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace, who leads an army against England\u2019s King Edward I in the Scottish War of Independence. The film was criticized for being historically inaccurate, but that\u2019s almost beside the point it features both some of the most intense war sequences ever filmed, and some of the best meditations on freedom ever uttered by a movie character. \u201cFight and you may die run, and you\u2019ll live  \u2026     at least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days, from this day to that, for one chance  \u2014   just one chance  \u2014   to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they\u2019ll never take our freedom!\u201d Good stuff. But keep the kids away from this one.  \u2014   D. N. 3. Rocky (1976) Sylvester Stallone wrote the script and starred in this 1976 classic that captured the imagination of a generation and snagged three Academy awards, including Best Picture. Stallone is   boxer Rocky Balboa, a   southpaw who bobs and weaves his way through the grime and grit of his native Philadelphia. While the film\u2019s plot is loosely based on boxer Chuck Wepner\u2019s grueling bout with Muhammad Ali  the character of Rocky is inspired by boxing legend Rocky Marciano. Called up to play the patsy punching bag in an exhibition bout with heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, Balboa seizes the opportunity of a lifetime. In the process, he also finds the love of his life  \u2014   a shy woman who, like Balboa, is a diamond in the rough. The film is a timeless character study on what it means to be a man and to \u201cgo the distance\u201d against seemingly impossible odds and despite one\u2019s fears. Ironically, \u201cRocky\u201d   its weight class at the box office. The John G.   film was made on a budget of about $1 million, but went on to become the   movie of the year, grossing an astounding $117 million. That is thanks, in part, to an incredible cast of actors, including Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith.  \u2014   J. H. 4. Glory (1989) This 1989 American Civil War epic tells the true story of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, one of the first official black fighting units in the Union Army. The film follows the regiment\u2019s formation under the leadership of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the son of prominent Boston abolitionists, and ends with the 54th\u2019s valiant charge at the Second Battle of Fort Wagner. Directed by Ed Zwick, the film depicts the struggles and indignities faced by the black regiment as they fight for the right to wear the blue uniform into battle for their own freedom. In the process, Glory explores what it means to be a free man and to carry oneself with dignity and courage. Kevin Jarre\u2019s intensely emotional screenplay, based on Lincoln Kirstein\u2019s Lay This Laurel and Peter Burchard\u2019s One Gallant Rush, as well as Colonel Shaw\u2019s letters, is commanded by a colorful cast of   talent, including Cary Elwes, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick as Colonel Shaw. The film saw Denzel Washington win his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Rooted in the characters\u2019 commitment to overcome the brutality of battle and their own personal demons, Glory was one of the first films to bravely and honestly portray the horrors and heroes of the Civil War.  \u2014   J. H. 5. Rudy (1993) Sean Astin shines in this 1993   film  \u2014   based on a true story  \u2014   about a small man with an outsized desire to achieve his goal of playing football at the University of Notre Dame. Rudy follows Daniel \u201cRudy\u201d Ruettiger\u2019s journey from his small steel mill town to sports legend. Born far from brilliant, Rudy attends a junior college close to Notre Dame, takes a minimum wage job, and undergoes extensive tutoring to overcome his dyslexia. A true tribute to the power of an unbreakable will, Rudy stops at nothing to make the Notre Dame football team. And when he finally gets his chance, he doesn\u2019t waste it. Rudy is ranked 54th on the American Film Institute\u2019s \u201cMost Inspiring Films of All Time\u201d list. The film is perhaps the quintessential underdog story that reinforces the virtues of hard work and determination in achieving one\u2019s goals.  \u2014   J. H. 6. Juno (2007) This small independent film starring Ellen Page, Michael Cera and Jennifer Garner caught Hollywood by surprise in 2007, turning a $7. 5 million production budget into $231 million in global box office receipts and four Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture (it won one, Best Original Screenplay for Diablo Cody). Page plays Juno MacGuff, a    high school sophomore forced to make a tough decision when she discovers she\u2019s pregnant after a seemingly harmless sexual encounter with a friend. The film could have ended very quickly (and tragically) with a trip to Planned Parenthood but Cody\u2019s script deftly balances Juno\u2019s internal emotional conflicts with the gentle humor of life\u2019s most challenging and often unplanned surprises the result is one of the only mainstream,   hit films ever made.  \u2014   D. N. 7. Groundhog Day (1993) Harold Ramis and Bill Murray\u2019s 1993 comedy masterpiece may not seem like a \u201cconservative\u201d movie at first glance. But Phil Connors\u2019s unending nightmare in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania  \u2014   in which he is forced to   the same day, February 2, over and over and over again  \u2014   is actually a profound story about the things that matter most to us as human beings. As a sort of karmic morality tale, Murray\u2019s arrogant and shallow character is forced to relive the same day until he finally becomes a better man  \u2014   and even wins the affections of his     played by Andie MacDowell. In an excellent column at National Review, Jonah Goldberg calls the film \u201cthe best cinematic moral allegory popular culture has produced in decades  \u2014   perhaps ever. \u201d It\u2019s also uproariously funny: \u201cThis is one time where television really fails to capture the true excitement of a large squirrel predicting the weather. \u201d Well, maybe you have to see it. Danny Rubin and Ramis won a BAFTA Award for their screenplay, and Groundhog Day was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2007.  \u2014   D. N.
