Musburger, who is 77, said he was leaving active sportscasting to help his family get a sports handicapping business started and to use some of the millions of airline miles he has earned for recreational travel. His last game will be the   men\u2019s basketball game Tuesday night. That takes him back to Rupp Arena, where he called Villanova\u2019s upset over Georgetown in the final of the N. C. A. A. tournament in 1985. Musburger and ESPN said his comments about the Oklahoma football player Joe Mixon that were criticized as insensitive during the Sugar Bowl this month had nothing to do with his exit. On the broadcast, Musburger said that he hoped Mixon, who had been suspended for a year after punching a woman and breaking her jaw, would make the most of his second chance. He did not initially talk about Mixon\u2019s victim. A former sportswriter, Musburger\u2019s broadcast fame took off through his work on \u201cN. F. L. Today,\u201d the pro football pregame show. He broadcast the N. B. A. college basketball, the Masters golf tournament and tennis  \u2014   most of CBS\u2019s marquee events. He was behind the mike for one of college football\u2019s most memorable plays, Doug Flutie\u2019s \u201cHail Mary\u201d pass that beat Miami for Boston College in 1984. He confessed to Flutie later that it took him awhile to identify Gerard Phelan, Flutie\u2019s roommate, as the receiver of that pass  \u2014   and Flutie told him he didn\u2019t know, either, until he had run off the field. Musburger was abruptly dropped by CBS in 1990 in what was perceived as a salary dump, then went to work for ABC and ESPN. \u201cBrent made every event feel larger,\u201d said Stephanie Druley, ESPN senior vice president for events and studio production. \u201cTo me, there is probably not a greater storyteller as a    person. He can spin a yarn like nobody else, and it made games definitely more enjoyable to watch. \u201d Musburger\u2019s opportunities for national exposure grew more limited in recent years when ESPN assigned him to its SEC Network for college football. But he still called college basketball regularly, and even though ESPN has been trying to save money lately by cutting   talent, Druley said the network had no interest in seeing him leave. Sportscasting today \u201chas become more and more numbers driven, advanced statistics and everything,\u201d Musburger said. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I was never going to change because I\u2019m a people guy. I like pulling up a chair in a saloon with a cold beer and telling stories. \u201d Musburger took heat in 2013 when he extolled the attractiveness of an Alabama quarterback\u2019s girlfriend, a controversy he found silly. \u201cI called a beauty queen beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d He said he hoped people felt comfortable listening to him. \u201cNot everyone approved of everything I said,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that. I come from a sportswriting background, and I\u2019m not afraid to take a position on certain things from time to time. But for the most part, I thought people should be coming to a game to escape for three hours and forget about what their individual problems are. \u201d He said he was not ready to fully retire (\u201cI don\u2019t do shuffleboard well,\u201d he said) but his decision lets ESPN escape from an uncomfortable decision. Having a broadcaster of college games publicly identified with a sports handicapping business wouldn\u2019t fly. That accounts for the odd timing of his departure in the middle of the college basketball season his family wants the site fully operational by the N. C. A. A. men\u2019s basketball tournament. If anything, the move will force Musburger to change a pat answer when he is approached by fans. \u201cThey always ask me my favorite game, and I always say, \u2018The next one,\u2019 \u201d he said. After Tuesday, that will no longer be applicable.'"}, "time": 1742628531.5845745}
