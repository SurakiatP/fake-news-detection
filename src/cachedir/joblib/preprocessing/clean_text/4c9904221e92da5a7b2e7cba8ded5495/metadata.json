The news outlet described them as \u201cseparate sources\u201d within the agency. \\nAgents have interviewed several people involved in the foundation case, looking for possible pay-to-play links between then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. The White Collar Crime division of the FBI is conducting the investigation. \\n\u201cThere is an avalanche of new information coming in every day,\u201d a source told Fox News. \\nSources, meanwhile, told Fox that FBI agents collected a significant amount of evidence even before WikiLeaks started releasing emails linked to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. \\nAs FBI agents are \u201cactively and aggressively pursuing this case,\u201d they\u2019ll interview the same people again\u2014possibly some for a third time, the report stated. They\u2019ll also look into what Hillary Clinton and her aides told them in previous interviews. \\nWhile on the air, Fox News reporter Bret Baier, citing unnamed sources, said that Clinton\u2019s private email server has been breached by at least five separate foreign intelligence hackers. \\n\u201cI pressed again and again on this very issue, and these sources said, \u2018Yes, the investigations will continue\u2019\u201d if Clinton defeats rival Donald Trump on Election Day, Baier said on Fox News. \\n\u201cAnd barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they\u2019ll continue to likely an indictment,\u201d Baier added .'"}, "time": 1742563319.7251487}
