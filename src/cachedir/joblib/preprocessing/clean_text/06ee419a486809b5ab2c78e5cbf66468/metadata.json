{"duration": 0.8894398212432861, "input_args": {"text": "'Welcome to the Breitbart News Livewire of President Donald Trump\u2019s first address to a Joint Session of Congress. The president will address the nation at 9:00 pm eastern from the Hall of the House of Representatives, where he is expected to lay out a broad vision of his administration\u2019s agenda. [Topics he\u2019s expected to address include Obamacare, immigration, the border wall, his budget, military buildup, veteran affairs, national security, trade,   economy, education, and law enforcement. He\u2019ll touch on the same themes that propelled him to the White House. Look for an emphasis on America First  \u2014   with the phrase \u201cbuy American and hire American\u201d as his administration\u2019s policy lodestar.  Capitol Hill is looking for any indication of Trump\u2019s preference on the various Obamacare replacement proposals. Politico, however, reports that Trump is unlikely to embrace any specific plan. Breitbart\u2019s Sean Moran offers a primer on the various Obamacare replacement plans. Trump\u2019s budget is also being hotly debated. Jonathan Swan at Axios reports that Trump is not expected to explicitly endorse Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s border adjustment tax tonight, which, Swan reports, Trump\u2019s team is \u201cdivided on. The nationalist wing of the White House  \u2014   led by Steve Bannon  \u2014   supports the plan to raise $1 trillion by hiking taxes on imports. Officials closer to corporate America, including top economic advisor Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are said to be deeply skeptical. \u201d Ryan wants the border adjustment tax to offset any Trump tax cut proposal. Swan has updated his initial story to note the White House talking points about the address state: \u201cWe must have fair trade for our workers  \u2014   foreign countries can no longer be allowed to tax our exports while shipping goods into our country for free. \u201d This language might suggest an openness to the border adjustment tax concept or simply signal a willingness to use tariffs. The budget debate is also expected to be contentious in the coming weeks with Sen. Lindsay Graham ( ) declaring the president\u2019s budget \u201cdead on arrival\u201d because of Trump\u2019s proposed cuts to the State Department. Meanwhile, there are also reports that Trump might be open to \u201can immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides. \u201d As Breitbart\u2019s Neil Munro points out, take these reports with a grain of salt until further details of such a deal are hashed out. We can also expect the usual D. C. partisan drama tonight. Some Democrat lawmakers are boycotting the address, including Rep. Maxine Waters ( ). Others are bringing illegal immigrants with them as their guests. First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s guests, on the other hand, reportedly include Jessica Davis, Susan Oliver, and Jamiel Shaw, Sr.  \u2014   each of whom lost loved ones to illegal immigrant criminals. Stay with us throughout the evening as we offer live updates. All times eastern. Watch the speech live on Breitbart\u2019s Facebook here. *** 12:09 am  \u2014   Watching the cable news replay of the speech one is struck again by the impolite manner in which Democrat lawmakers refused to even clap as a show of acknowledgment or greeting to the president at the beginning of his address. Republicans were never this impolite to President Obama during his State of the Union addresses. The closest thing that comes to mind is South Carolina Congressman Joe Wilson\u2019s infamous \u201cyou lie!\u201d outburst during Obama\u2019s address to Congress in 2009, but even that was widely condemned by his fellow Republicans, which is the sort of   you\u2019ll never see Democrats do among themselves and certainly not for any slight given to this president. 11:31 pm  \u2014   America liked it.

Pollak (@joelpollak) March 1, 2017,  10:10 pm  \u2014   Trump calls on all Americans to seize the moment  \u2026     \u201cThe time for small thinking is over.  The time for trivial fights is behind us   \u2026     I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.  And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and  \u2014   Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America. Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States. \u201d 10:06 pm  \u2014   Trump is concluding his address on a positive, upbeat message of American greatness. \u201cWhen we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God. \u201d 10:05 pm  \u2014   Trump articulates a foreign policy message that harkens back to George Washington. \u201cAmerica is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. \u201d 10:03 pm  \u2014   Big applause for this: \u201cMy job is not to represent the world.  My job is to represent the United States of America. \u201d Trump called for NATO to pay their fair share.  10:01 pm  \u2014   Sustained applause for this: \u201cWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U. S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior, and a hero  \u2014    battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \u2018Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\u2019  Ryan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity. \u201d  Ryan\u2019s wife, standing next to Ivanka Trump, holds back the tears. Trump ad libbed: \u201cRyan is looking down right now, and I think he\u2019s very happy, because he just broke a record. \u201d Trump continues: \u201cThe Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends.  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom  \u2014    we will never forget him. \u201d 9:53 pm  \u2014   Trump says: \u201cI have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.  The office is called VOICE  \u2014    Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. \u201d He then points out the stories of Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis  \u2014   whose families were victims of illegal immigrant criminals. Very emotional reception for families who were forgotten for so long.  There was, however, an audible groan from Democrats when Trump mentioned VOICE.  Groans and murmurs in the Democratic crowd as Trump announces new VOICE program for victims of illegal immigrant violence,  \u2014   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 1, 2017,  9:52 pm  \u2014   Trump calls for support of the men and women of law enforcement and the victims of crime. \u201cWe must build bridges of cooperation and trust  \u2014    not drive the wedge of disunity and division. \u201d 9:49 pm  \u2014   Trump repeats a line that former President George W. Bush often said, \u201cEducation is the civil rights issue of our time. \u201d He calls for school choice. He highlights another guest  \u2014   Denisha Merriweather, who attended a private center of learning and \u201cwith the help of a tax credit scholarship program.  Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.  Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. \u201d The pride on Denisha Merriweather\u2019s face as @POTUS tells her story of perseverance  success at private school is just amazing #trumpaddress,  \u2014   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) March 1, 2017,  9:47 pm  \u2014   Trump introduces Megan Crowley, who was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, but her own father \u201cfounded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\u2019s life.  Today she is 20 years old  \u2014   and a sophomore at Notre Dame. \u201d Trump highlights the story in order to call for reform of the Food and Drug Administration.  9:46 pm  \u2014   This isn\u2019t the sort of thing you\u2019d expect to see from a Republican president, but it\u2019s very much a populist message: \u201cMy administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women\u2019s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. \u201d 9:42 pm  \u2014   Trump lays out his vision of Obamacare replacement. It still includes coverage for   conditions, health savings accounts, tort reform, taking on big pharma to bring down price of drugs, and allowing the ability to purchase insurance across state lines in order to create \u201ca truly competitive national marketplace. \u201d House Democrats give Trump \u201cThumbs down\u201d after he says he will repeal and replace Obamacare pic. twitter.   \u2014   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 1, 2017,  9:41 pm  \u2014    Corporate America may not like this speech, but focus groupers of both parties do not want them to leave the country. #JointAddress pic. twitter.   \u2014   Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) March 1, 2017,  9:39 pm  \u2014   Huge applause when Trump says he\u2019s calling on Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare. And he comes out against the individual mandate! \u201cMandating every American to buy   health insurance was never the right solution for America. \u201d 9:38 pm  \u2014   Trump on his infrastructure plan: \u201cTo launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States  \u2014   financed through both public and private capital  \u2014    creating millions of new jobs. \u201d 9:36 pm  \u2014   Trump addresses immigration reform: \u201cSwitching away from this current system of   immigration, and instead adopting a   system, will have many benefits:  it will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages, and help struggling families  \u2014    including immigrant families  \u2014    enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security, and to restore respect for our laws. \u201d 9:35 pm  \u2014    . @POTUS: We\u2019ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross. https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) March 1, 2017,  9:32 pm  \u2014   Trump gets a laugh when he mentions his meeting with Harley Davidson executives.

Applause at the mention of his SCOTUS nominee Judge Gorsuch. 9:26 pm  \u2014   No equivocating in this language: \u201cAs promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS  \u2014   a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.  We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. \u201d 9:25 pm  \u2014   He makes the case for vetting: \u201cWe have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.  Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America  \u2014   we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. \u201d 9:22 pm  \u2014   Here is the Trump who won the election: \u201cWe must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.  Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. \u201d He calls out Dems directly: \u201cTo any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question:  what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\u201d 9:20 pm  \u2014   Sad  \u2026     Democrats laughing and hollering when Trump says he has begun to \u201ddrain the swamp of government corruption\u201d  \u2014   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 1, 2017,  9:18 pm  \u2014   Trump gets applause for mentioning he cleared the way for the Dakota Access Pipeline, and we\u2019ll be using American steel on all the pipelines. 9:16 pm  \u2014   He explains what he has already done to keep his promises to bring jobs back to the U. S. He also mentions the stock market bump and the cost cutting savings he\u2019s already done. He notes the hiring freeze and the efforts to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d by putting a   ban on lobbying for former government officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments. He also mentions his order to cut regulations. 9:13 pm  \u2014   Trump sounds the same themes of his inaugural address and campaign  \u2014   explaining the movement of the forgotten men and women who propelled his victory in order to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d by putting Americans first. He gets a standing ovation. 9:10 pm  \u2014   Trump opens with a unifying statement condemning the recent acts of   and hatred with the desecration of Jewish graves. 9:04 pm  \u2014   And here he is. President Trump enters the Chamber. No applause from some Democrat lawmakers, just standing in stony silence. The Democrat women in white are notably silent. 9:00 pm  \u2014   Here is the text of the prepared remarks: TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation\u2019s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.  Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\u2019s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice  \u2014    in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands.  And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world  \u2014   friend or foe  \u2014   will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding  \u2014   250 years since the day we declared our Independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we\u2019ve watched our middle class shrink as we\u2019ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We\u2019ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit  \u2014   and so many other places throughout our land. We\u2019ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross  \u2014   and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we\u2019ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.  The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds   \u2014   families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus  \u2014   as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake  \u2014   and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first   \u2026     because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Dying industries will come roaring back to life.  Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. It\u2019s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I\u2019ve made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford,   General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record.  We\u2019ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new   jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government.  We have placed a hiring freeze on   and   Federal workers. We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials  \u2014    and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job\u2011crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines  \u2014   thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs  \u2014   and I\u2019ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel. We have withdrawn the United States from the     Partnership. With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth  \u2014   and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.  We want all Americans to succeed  \u2014    but that can\u2019t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.  We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.  Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question:  what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.  We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for   offenses since   came here from outside of our country.  We have seen the attacks at home   \u2014   from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.  Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America  \u2014   we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe  \u2014   and to keep out those who would do us harm. As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS  \u2014   a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.  We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court  \u2014   from my list of 20 judges  \u2014   who will defend our Constitution.  I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.  Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.  To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law.  He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.   million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined. We\u2019ve lost more than   of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we\u2019ve lost 60, 000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters. Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party.  It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy  \u2014   making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.  At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes  \u2014   but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing. I just met with officials and workers from a great American company,  .  In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?  They said that it\u2019s good.  I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales.  They told me  \u2014   without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it  \u2014   that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.  They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren\u2019t even asking for change.  But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the \u201cabandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people. \u201d Lincoln was right  \u2014   and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. I am going to bring back millions of jobs.  Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.  The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others  \u2014    have a   immigration system.  It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.  Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America\u2019s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. Switching away from this current system of   immigration, and instead adopting a   system, will have many benefits:  it will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages, and help struggling families  \u2014    including immigrant families  \u2014    enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security, and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the   of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program  \u2014    the building of the interstate highway system.  The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.  With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country  \u2014    twice.  And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States  \u2014   financed through both public and private capital  \u2014    creating millions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles:  Buy American, and Hire American. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare. Mandating every American to buy   health insurance was never the right solution for America.  The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.  Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State  \u2014   it is unsustainable and collapsing. One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges  \u2014    leaving many Americans with no choice at all. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken. Obamacare is collapsing  \u2014    and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.  Action is not a choice  \u2014    it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans: First, we should ensure that Americans with   conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts  \u2014    but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government. Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance  \u2014   and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately. Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines  \u2014    creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care. Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.  Every problem can be solved.  And every hurting family can find healing, and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more  \u2014    so why not join forces to finally get it done?  On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people. My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women\u2019s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.  Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.  She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan\u2019s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.  He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\u2019s life.  Today she is 20 years old  \u2014   and a sophomore at Notre Dame. Megan\u2019s story is about the unbounded power of a father\u2019s love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\u2019s life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind  \u2014    and the souls  \u2014    of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of   and Latino children.  These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them. Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.  As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.  But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program.  Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.  Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest   increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4, 000 people were shot last year alone  \u2014    and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society. Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a   job. But to create this future, we must work with  \u2014    not against   \u2014   the men and women of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and trust  \u2014    not drive the wedge of disunity and division. Police and sheriffs are members of our community.  They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters  \u2014   and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they\u2019ll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.  The office is called VOICE  \u2014    Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis. Jamiel\u2019s    son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.  Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback.  But he never got the chance.  His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine. Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.  Their husbands  \u2014    Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis  \u2014    were slain in the line of duty in California.  They were pillars of their community.  These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.  Jenna:  I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you. To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica:  I want you to know  \u2014    we will never stop fighting for justice.  Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and  \u2014    if they must  \u2014    to fight and to win. I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation  \u2014    and now we must deliver for them. The challenges we face as a Nation are great.  But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform. We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U. S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior, and a hero  \u2014    battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \u201cRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies. \u201d  Ryan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity.  For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends.  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom  \u2014    we will never forget him. To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.  It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism. But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific  \u2014    to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people  \u2014    and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.  My job is not to represent the world.  My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict  \u2014   not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past  \u2014    we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. The only   solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding. America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found.  America is friends today with former enemies.  Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars.  This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America\u2019s centennial.  At that celebration, the country\u2019s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter.  An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America\u2019s 250th year. Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear  \u2014   schools where children learn in peace  \u2014   and jobs where Americans prosper and grow  \u2014   are not too much to ask. When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God. And when we fulfill this vision when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began. The time for small thinking is over.  The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action. From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears  \u2014    inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past  \u2014    and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.  And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and  \u2014   Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America. Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States. 9:01 pm  \u2014   Some pregame talking points from Rep.

Speakers from the event included the ACLU, DailyKos, Food  Water Watch, MoveOn. org, Our Revolution, National Nurses United, and others.  Rosie O\u2019Donnell also headlined the event where she called for continued resistance against the president.  O\u2019Donnell read from the Declaration of Independence, saying, \u201cWhenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government. \u201d She added, \u201cThat is why we are here. \u201d  \u201cThis is not Russia. To Donald Trump and his pathetic band of white, privileged criminal businessmen, I would like to say to him, \u2018Nyet! Sir, nyet! nyet! nyet! nyet! \u2019\u201d  \u201cNo we won\u2019t. We have seen what you have done, sir. We have seen your connection with Russia. The game is over. The Internet rules,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.  She added, \u201cHe lies! He lies! He lies! He lies!\u201d O\u2019Donnell chanted, until several other women in the crowd repeated her words.  \u201cAnd it\u2019s about time they all started saying that, instead of it appears as if he hasn\u2019t been speaking the truth. Cut it down to the    like he does,\u201d she said, later adding that they were going to go \u201cdown and dirty like Donald Trump. \u201d \u201cYou know what the truth is? A very handsome conservative man stopped me on my way up with his iPhone, to ask me with his very charming, Irish,    face, if George Soros has paid me to come here. And I said, \u2018Sir I have never met George Soros, but he seems like a lovely man. One day I\u2019d like to share a souvlaki with him. \u2019\u201d She said she\u2019s only met Trump twice. One at his wedding to Marla Maples where she said Trump \u201cshook the hands of the guests at the wedding as he walked down the aisle to take his vows. Warning! Warning! Warning Will Robinson!\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.  She added, \u201cWe will get him out!

On Obamacare, per Roberts, Trump will say: \u201cTonight I\u2019m also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care. \u201d The president will also call for stronger immigration enforcement. \u201cBy finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars and make our communities safer for everyone,\u201d President Trump will say, according to Fox\u2019s Roberts. 8:07 pm  \u2014   Some speech excerpts trickling out already, including excerpts from the Democrats\u2019 response to Trump\u2019s address. There seems to be some dispute as to how long the speech is expected to run. I\u2019m told @POTUS speech to Congress will be about 45 minutes long.  Applause breaks may take it longer. @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews,  \u2014   John Roberts (@johnrobertsFox) February 28, 2017,  Trump speech expected to run 1 hour and 15 minute later tonight, we are told.  \u2014   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 28, 2017,  Democratic response excerpt: Pres.
