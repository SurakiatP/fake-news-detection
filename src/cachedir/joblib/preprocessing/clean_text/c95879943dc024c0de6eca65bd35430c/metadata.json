Roundup and similar products are used around the world on everything from row crops to home gardens. It is Monsanto\u2019s flagship product, and   research has long found it to be relatively safe. A case in federal court in San Francisco has challenged that conclusion, building on the findings of an international panel that claimed Roundup\u2019s main ingredient might cause cancer. The court documents included Monsanto\u2019s internal emails and email traffic between the company and federal regulators. The records suggested that Monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that a senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency had worked to quash a review of Roundup\u2019s main ingredient, glyphosate, that was to have been conducted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The documents also revealed that there was some disagreement within the E. P. A. over its own safety assessment. The files were unsealed by Judge Vince Chhabria, who is presiding over litigation brought by people who claim to have developed  \u2019s lymphoma as a result of exposure to glyphosate. The litigation was touched off by a determination made nearly two years ago by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a branch of the World Health Organization, that glyphosate was a probable carcinogen, citing research linking it to  \u2019s lymphoma. Court records show that Monsanto was tipped off to the determination by a deputy division director at the E. P. A. Jess Rowland, months beforehand. That led the company to prepare a public relations assault on the finding well in advance of its publication. Monsanto executives, in their internal email traffic, also said Mr. Rowland had promised to beat back an effort by the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own review. Dan Jenkins, a Monsanto executive, said in an email in 2015 that Mr. Rowland, referring to the other agency\u2019s potential review, had told him, \u201cIf I can kill this, I should get a medal. \u201d The review never took place. In another email, Mr. Jenkins noted to a colleague that Mr. Rowland was planning to retire and said he \u201ccould be useful as we move forward with ongoing glyphosate defense. \u201d The safety of glyphosate is not settled science. A number of agencies, including the European Food Safety Agency and the E. P. A. have disagreed with the international cancer agency, playing down concerns of a cancer risk, and Monsanto has vigorously defended glyphosate. But the court records also reveal a level of debate within the E. P. A. The agency\u2019s Office of Research and Development raised some concern about the robustness of an assessment carried out by the agency\u2019s Office of Pesticide Programs, where Mr. Rowland was a senior official at the time, and recommended in December 2015 that it take steps to \u201cstrengthen\u201d its \u201chuman health assessment. \u201d In a statement, Monsanto said, \u201cGlyphosate is not a carcinogen. \u201d It added: \u201cThe allegation that glyphosate can cause cancer in humans is inconsistent with decades of comprehensive safety reviews by the leading regulatory authorities around the world. The plaintiffs have submitted isolated documents that are taken out of context. \u201d The E. P. A. had no immediate comment, and Mr. Rowland could not be reached immediately. Monsanto also rebutted suggestions that the disclosures highlighted concerns that the academic research it underwrites is compromised. Monsanto frequently cites such research to back up its safety claims on Roundup and pesticides. In one email unsealed Tuesday, William F. Heydens, a Monsanto executive, told other company officials that they could ghostwrite research on glyphosate by hiring academics to put their names on papers that were actually written by Monsanto. \u201cWe would be keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and they would just edit  sign their names so to speak,\u201d Mr. Heydens wrote, citing a previous instance in which he said the company had done this. Asked about the exchange, Monsanto said in a second statement that its \u201cscientists did not ghostwrite the paper\u201d that was referred to or previous work, adding that a paper that eventually appeared \u201cunderwent the journal\u2019s rigorous peer review process before it was published. \u201d David Kirkland, one of the scientists mentioned in the email, said in an interview, \u201cI would not publish a document that had been written by someone else. \u201d He added, \u201cWe had no interaction with Monsanto at all during the process of reviewing the data and writing the papers. \u201d The disclosures are the latest to raise concerns about the integrity of academic research financed by agrochemical companies. Last year, a review by The New York Times showed how the industry can manipulate academic research or misstate findings. Declarations of interest included in a   paper on glyphosate that appeared in the journal Critical Reviews in Toxicology said panel members were recruited by a consulting firm. Email traffic made public shows that Monsanto officials discussed and debated scientists who should be considered, and shaped the project. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that people hold Monsanto accountable when they say one thing and it\u2019s completely contradicted by very frank internal documents,\u201d said Timothy Litzenburg of the Miller Firm, one of the law firms handling the litigation. The issue of glyphosate\u2019s safety is not a trivial one for Americans. Over the last two decades, Monsanto has genetically   corn, soybeans and cotton so it is much easier to spray them with the weed killer, and some 220 million pounds of glyphosate were used in 2015 in the United States. \u201cPeople should know that there are superb scientists in the world who would disagree with Monsanto and some of the regulatory agencies\u2019 evaluations, and even E. P. A. has disagreement within the agency,\u201d said Robin Greenwald, a lawyer at Weitz  Luxenberg, which is also involved in the litigation. \u201cEven in the E. U. there\u2019s been a lot of disagreement among the countries. It\u2019s not so simple as Monsanto makes it out to be. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561896.7213597}
