[Sky News reports that Butt, who they say came to Britain with his parents from Pakistan as asylum seekers, worked for Transport for London.  Further reports indicate Butt\u2019s work gave him access to tunnels under the Houses of Parliament from the Westminster Underground Station  \u2014   despite the fact he had been investigated for terror links by MI5 and even been featured on a Channel 4 documentary about   Islamists titled \u2018The Jihadis Next Door\u2018. Pakistani security officials told The Telegraph newspaper that raids on homes and businesses connected to the Butt family were being carried out as a precaution, but that the terrorist was likely radicalised in Britain and trained in Syria. \u201cOur British counterparts told us they don\u2019t think he was radicalised here, and we think it is probably more likely that he was trained in Syria,\u201d one said. \u201cBut we are searching the homes of any relatives connected to him and we are tracing all telephone calls made by family members. \u201d The news comes as Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley declared Britain was now facing a \u201ccompletely different\u201d level of threat and indicated that current policing and security methods are not equal to the task of containing it. \u201cIn nine weeks, we\u2019ve had five plots foiled and three successful attacks. That is completely different to anything we have seen for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the Prime Minister has indicated, we\u2019re going to need to do some things differently. We\u2019re going to have to think again about the next iteration of our police and security service model, which has constantly had to innovate over many decades. \u201d Regarding Butt, the Assistant Commissioner defended the decision to drop an inquiry into his activities by saying there was \u201cno intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned\u201d. He added that he expected the authorities \u201cwill probably discover information on covert communications that were [not in] our knowledge that if we had access to those communications it may have changed our judgment\u201d suggesting he wants new powers to monitor encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp.'"}, "time": 1742561958.2862122}
