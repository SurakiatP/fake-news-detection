That was universally labeled an act of \u201cpolitical terrorism,\u201d which it clearly was. \\nBut the truth is, there are many more examples of this kind of violent hatred across the country. Our friends at Lifezette have compiled some of the most notable examples that you may not have been told about. They get local media coverage, but barely make it into the national news: On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, \u201cWhy can\u2019t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?\u201d Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. \u201cThe two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by \u2018some thugs\u2019 that a barmaid called out from the back.\u201d Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d shirt. On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. On Sept. 26 at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, as the first presidential debate was about to get underway, a woman wearing Trump campaign apparel was assaulted while heading to a debate watch event. \u201cNobody, regardless of race, gender, or political party, should feel unsafe because of the way they look or what they wear when they walk on campus,\u201d the Minnesota Federation of College Republicans said in a press release. On Aug. 19 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump supporters had to run a gauntlet of angry protesters to get into a Trump fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center. When they left after the event they were hit, pushed, and spit on. On Aug. 13 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 68-year-old cancer survivor Vester Bullock was beaten at a garage sale because he wore a Trump pin on his hat. The assailant \u201cslammed his arms, walked up to me and said, \u2018My wife told me I shouldn\u2019t trust a God-damn Republican,'\u201d he said. The man complained the staple gun Bullock sold him didn\u2019t work. \u201cI told him \u2018I\u2019ll give you your money back,'\u201d said Bullock. \u201cBut he kept calling me all kinds of names.\u201d The man punched Bullock in the jaw so hard he lost a tooth. On Aug. 12 in the West Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, two women assaulted pro-Trump activist Tim Treadstone after a Trump rally. \u201cThis blonde girl grabbed my iPhone and threw it as hard as she could to the pavement,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd before I could pick it up, the brunette who was throwing the food at people punched me in the head. My glasses and my hat flew off. There were claw marks on my neck.\u201d Last week, the two women were formally charged with assault and battery. The night of the rally, Treadstone and a group of Trump hat-wearers were denied service at a popular Mexican eatery. Customers began screaming at the Trump backers and throwing food at them. Earlier, at the West Hollywood rally, \u201ca can of Monster energy drink, eggs, and dog feces were also thrown at pro-Trump demonstrators,\u201d according to Breitbart News. \u201cThe can of Monster hit one man on the back.\u201d On Aug. 3 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, an assailant attacked a 62-year-old man who was walking down the street wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt, local police said. \u201cThe motorist inquired why [the man] was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him,\u201d a police spokesman said. \u201cThe [victim] continued to walk away as [the] motorist followed him.\u201d The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs, On June 18, 19-year-old British national Michael Sandford tried to take a gun from a Las Vegas police officer during a Trump rally. Sandford was arrested and reportedly said he intended to use the gun to kill Trump. Unlike most of the anti-Trump attacks, this event was widely reported by the media. On June 2, in San Jose, California, rioters assaulted a group of attendees leaving a Trump rally. Fourteen of those attacked have filed a class-action lawsuit against the city and Mayor Sam Liccardo. The attendees \u201cwere victimized by being forced by armed police to walk into a riot in full swing where many were assaulted while police looked on,\u201d said their lawyer, Harmeet K. Dhillon. In San Jose, protesters also threw eggs, a tomato, and a bottle at Rachel Casey, a 29-year-old Trump supporter they cornered outside a hotel. \u201cI knew if I was to touch one of them or I was to grab one of the flags they were waving in my face that they would have attacked me or beaten me with those flag poles that were metal,\u201d Casey told Breitbart News. \u201cI just kept a straight face, I don\u2019t know how. I just knew if I touched one of them I would get hurt. Luckily someone let me in that hotel, finally, someone finally opened the door.\u201d On April 28, in Costa Mesa, California, anti-Trump demonstrators threw rocks at moving cars. One bloodied the face of a Trump supporter who was driving away after the rally. About 20 people were arrested. On March 12 at the Dayton, Ohio, airport, Black Lives Matter supporter Thomas Dimassimo rushed the small stage where Trump was speaking, an attack that received widespread media attention. He was tackled by Secret Service agents before he could reach the GOP candidate and was later charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic. Before the attack he tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve had about all I can take from the violent trump ralliers. Saturday im [sic] going to check my people and spit on their false king.\u201d After his release from jail, hours later, he tweeted: \u201cF**k you b**ch @realDonaldTrump[.]\u201d \\nThis is but a sampling of the violence that has occurred by the left against Republicans, conservatives and Donald Trump supporters. \\nSo anyone who suggests that there would be violence after any contested elections needs to turn their eyes squarely on Hillary Clinton and her supporters.\""}, "time": 1742561990.0363278}
