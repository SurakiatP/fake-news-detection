[Of the 44 total cases, 41 are in Hennepin County, two are in Ramsey County, and one is in Crow Wing County.    are \u201cconfirmed to be unvaccinated. \u201d Two \u201chad 2 doses of MMR. \u201d   of the cases are \u201cin children ages 0 through 10 years,\u201d while there is \u201c1 case in an adult. \u201d MDH reports that \u201c38 of the cases are Somali Minnesotan. \u201d \u201cHealth officials said the Crow Wing county child may have been exposed in multiple locations in Hennepin County,\u201d MDH said in a statement released on Thursday. \u201cOnce measles begins to spread in unvaccinated populations, it can be very difficult to stop,\u201d Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious disease control for MDH, said in the statement. \u201cWe would not be surprised if we saw additional cases in other parts of the state where there are clusters of unvaccinated people before this is over,\u201d Ehresmann added. In Thursday\u2019s statement, MDH added new information about the investigation it has been conducting into the outbreak. According to the MDH statement: Disease investigators follow up with each confirmed case to determine how the person became infected and who was exposed to the case while they were infectious. Those exposed people who are determined not to be immune to measles  \u2014   because they have not been vaccinated nor had the disease  \u2014   are asked to exclude themselves from school, work or child care for 21 days. \u201cIn addition to case identification, investigation and   state and local health officials have been working with local public health staff and leaders in the Somali community to address concerns about autism and encourage MMR vaccination,\u201d the statement added. The measles outbreak, now the largest in the state in more than 20 years, is becoming costly to the taxpayers of Minnesota. The MDH statement noted: In the three weeks since the outbreak began, outbreak response efforts have involved more than 70 staff at the state level, working full or part time, at a cost of $207, 000. In addition, county public health staff and health care providers and facilities involved in the outbreak have accrued significant labor and related costs. The first case of measles in Minnesota in 2017 was diagnosed on April 11, but MDH did not report the first three cases publicly until April 13. \u201cMost of the exposures have occurred in either child care, health care or household settings. To date, more than 2, 500 people have been exposed,\u201d MDH said on Thursday. Early on in the outbreak, Ehresmann noted that \u201cmeasles can spread easily among unvaccinated people. \u201d \u201cThe best way to protect yourself and your community is to make sure everyone has been vaccinated,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cMeasles was declared eliminated in the U. S. in 2000, but it is still common in other parts of the world. Ehresmann noted that Europe is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak. Minnesota and other states still see sporadic cases  \u2014   typically linked to international travel,\u201d MDH said in a statement released on April 14, one day after the first three cases were reported: Most people in Minnesota are immune to measles either from having been vaccinated or from having had the disease. However, in recent years immunization rates have declined in some communities and groups  \u2014   often due to fears related to misinformation about vaccine risks. This decline in immunization rates increases the risk  \u2014   not only for those who are unvaccinated by choice, but also for those who cannot be vaccinated due to health status or age. Minnesota\u2019s Somali community in particular has struggled with low rates of immunization due in part to misinformation about immunization risks. \u201cThis outbreak is about unvaccinated children, not specific communities,\u201d said Minnesota Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger. \u201cUnfortunately, the Minnesota Somali community has been targeted with misinformation about vaccine risks. We\u2019re partnering with Somali community leaders and health care providers to counteract that misinformation. We want as many Minnesotans as possible to protect themselves and their families by getting vaccinated. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re working with the Somali community in the Twin Cities to alert people to the outbreak,\u201d Ehresmann added in the April 14 statement.'"}, "time": 1742562946.086596}
