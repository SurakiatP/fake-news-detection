The man, Robert Saulter, a lawyer in Boston for the United States Air Force, was in New York for the weekend and said he just had to be at Saturday\u2019s midnight   party for the latest in the Harry Potter series, \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d which is actually a play. \u201cIt sounds ridiculous that I\u2019m 32 years old and I\u2019m tearing up,\u201d Mr. Saulter said as the BookCourt store in the Cobble Hill neighborhood opened its doors. \u201cBut I always felt misunderstood and I feel like if you\u2019ve read the books, you understand the emotional connection you get to Harry, someone who really wanted to do good things with the world and wanted to feel loved. \u201d Mr. Saulter even named his son, who is 7 months old, Phoenix Harrison, for \u201cHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d the fifth in the series. Mr. Saulter was among nearly 200 people who waited at the store for the script that was written by Jack Thorne and based on a story by Mr. Thorne, John Tiffany and J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter book series, which led to films and a theme park. The play, which opened in London over the weekend, has already become a critical, commercial and  \u2014   with the casting of the black actress Noma Dumezweni as Hermione Granger  \u2014   controversial hit. It continues where the final book left off, as Harry and his crew send their children to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ms. Rowling has made it clear that \u201cCursed Child\u201d is not an eighth Harry Potter novel, but the fans do not care. The book topped the 2016   charts for Amazon\u2019s print and Kindle   sales, while also becoming Barnes  Noble\u2019s top   book since \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d in 2007. Scholastic, the publisher in the United States, will not have sales figures until later this week. It has been nearly 20 years since the first book and almost 10 years since the publication of \u201cDeathly Hallows,\u201d what many have considered the final chapter in Ms. Rowling\u2019s story. And Mary Gannett, an owner of BookCourt, said she had not been sure the store should host a party this time. Interest trickled in slowly after the script\u2019s publication was announced in February, Ms. Gannett said, but in the past week, requests for reserved copies nearly doubled. In New York and across the country,   Potterheads swarmed bookstores Saturday night and into Sunday morning to celebrate the release, as if they had found the secret winged key that not only let them back into their childhoods but also opened the door to another generation. Judy Stelter, the manager of Book World in Sturgeon Bay, Wis. was expecting a smaller, older audience for the store\u2019s midnight party. Instead, she was greeted by teenagers and young children with their parents, who filled the small store to enjoy cake and chocolate frogs (a treat among wizards). \u201cLook at all the young kids in here,\u201d Ms. Stelter said, standing beside boxes of \u201cCursed Child. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in here for a book that\u2019s in print and on paper, not on an electric device. Once they read like that, they\u2019ll read for life. \u201d Many fans happily brought family members who were not old enough  \u2014   or even born yet  \u2014   for the celebrations of the original series. In Atlanta, Erin Whitlock, 24, brought her    brother Liam to a Barnes  Noble in the Edgewood neighborhood. \u201cHe\u2019s as big a fan as I am, and it\u2019s just really cool to be here tonight because he gets to experience what I grew up with,\u201d Ms. Whitlock said, noting that her brother visits Ms. Rowling\u2019s website Pottermore, where she regularly publishes new stories. \u201cThe wizarding world doesn\u2019t stop with the books. It goes with your imagination. \u201d JillEllyn Riley, 48, a writer and editor who lives in Cobble Hill, perused the novels at BookCourt with her sons, ages 13 and 19, who did not seem to mind the spectacle of their mother dressed as Sybil Trelawney, a professor at Hogwarts. Ms. Riley said she hosted monthly Harry Potter club meetings in the neighborhood with her younger son. \u201cWe came here to BookCourt for Book 7, all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cMy    was 3, and I knew that later he would read the books and wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the midnight releases, but I knew he\u2019d know he had been there once. \u201d Aubrey Nolan, 25, who planned the evening at BookCourt, said she wanted to keep the activities family friendly. All around her, children sipped cream soda floats they passed off as butterbeer and decorated wands with paint, sequins and string. Others had mug shots taken that resembled the wizards imprisoned at Azkaban. Bookstores around the country embraced the theme, too, with Books of Wonder in Manhattan offering photos with owls (like Harry\u2019s Hedwig) and the Charles Deering Library at Northwestern University outside Chicago refereeing a Quidditch match, a sport played in the series. At the Elliott Bay Book Company in Seattle, nearly 250 people showed up for what was billed as a Hogwarts reunion. And members of the Seattle Shakesbeerience performed the first few scenes from the play with Patrick Lennon  \u2014   who said the group\u2019s motto is \u201cscript in one hand, drink in the other\u201d  \u2014   as Harry. \u201cI\u2019m in the group that aged along with Harry,\u201d Mr. Lennon, 30, said. \u201cOne of the actresses says she\u2019ll probably be crying through it. I might too. \u201d For some, nothing was more important than getting their hands on the newest edition, even if it meant waiting alone or interrupting a vacation. Annie Grandidge and Travis Dicks, tourists from New Castle, Australia, spent two and a half hours in line at the Barnes  Noble on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. And Ashley Johnson, 32, the actress who played Chrissy Seaver in the sitcom \u201cGrowing Pains,\u201d recently moved to Brooklyn to work on NBC\u2019s \u201cBlindspot.\u201d She showed up at BookCourt by herself, knowing she would easily make friends with other Potter fans. \u201cI was a little angry that I didn\u2019t read these as I was growing up,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cI found them in my   and I never got to go wait in line for the original books, so to be a part of that I felt like I needed to go do it. We don\u2019t get to do this with a lot of things with how fast the world moves, and to wait in line for a book at midnight feels really special. \u201d Margaret Piraino, 24, dressed as Nymphadora Tonks, a   witch, complete with rainbow hair and   jewelry, attended the BookCourt party with her girlfriend, Laurel Detkin, a fellow Potter enthusiast. But this time was different. \u201cI grew up with Harry Potter and it\u2019s been my entire life, and my dad would go to Barnes  Noble with me every time there was a new release,\u201d Ms. Piraino, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, said. \u201cAnd this year, my dad died in January and it\u2019s the first time I had to go on my own. \u201d In Seattle, Dylan Blanford, 13, donned a long black robe and a yellow tie as a member of Hufflepuff, one of the four houses at Hogwarts, and said he was jealous that he was not at parties for the previous Harry Potter books. He started reading the books at age 5. \u201cI\u2019m excited because there\u2019s still this little    jumping around inside of me going, \u2018Harry! Harry! Harry!\u2019 And there\u2019s also this    jumping around inside of me going, \u2018Harry! Harry! Harry! \u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited because it\u2019s not the end, forever, you know?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562148.1119845}
