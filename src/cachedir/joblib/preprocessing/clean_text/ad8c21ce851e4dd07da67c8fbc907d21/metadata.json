Nikki Hollis, a junior marketing executive, has been working at her current job for just three weeks, but her manager has already singled her out as being what he calls \u2018a weekender\u2019. Manager Denys Finch Hatton said: \u201cNikki has the lack of social life and deep fear of losing her job that will drive her to slog her guts out on more Saturdays and Sundays than she can count. \u201cShe is a great fit for the company and has already responded to subtle manipulations to stay late, even on a Friday. \u201cWith the right continued guilt-tripping from me, combined with a gradual build-up of workload and stress, I\u2019m confident she has a very bright future working here at weekends.\u201d The company currently runs a rewards scheme for weekend-working employees called \u2018Go Hard But Don\u2019t Go Home\u2019, which offers vouchers at an office cafe with the same name. \\nSave\""}, "time": 1742562557.576879}
