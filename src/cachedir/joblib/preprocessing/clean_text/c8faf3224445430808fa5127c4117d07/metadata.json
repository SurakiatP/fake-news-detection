President Donald Trump calling the journalists \u201cpartisan  \u201d. [Kassam joined a panel of two other guests to talk about the relationship of Mr Trump and the mainstream media, which he has repeatedly called out and criticised.  Trump\u2019s comments on the state of Sweden and it\u2019s societal fragmentation due to mass migration provoked mockery from Swedish politicians and many others in the media, but Kassam hit back against this, having just returned to the United States from a trip to Sweden\u2019s \u201cNo Go Zones\u201d just last week. \u201cThe president was absolutely manifestly correct on Sweden. I was there just last week in Rosengard in Malmo, in Husby and Rinkeby the suburbs of Stockholm and what I saw was absolutely terrifying,\u201d Kassam said. On Tuesday Kassam wrote at length about his experiences travelling through the areas that police have labelled as \u201c  zones\u201d and wrote, \u201cWithin minutes of exiting a cab outside central Husby, I was surrounded by drug dealers pushing \u201chashish\u201d and \u201cmarijuana\u201d. Within a few seconds more we witness two van loads of Swedish police appearing to negotiate one man\u2019s arrest from a building guarded by burly men. \u201d Though he remained unscathed, Kassam said the reason was likely due to his appearance and his acting innocuous, adding: \u201cbut for young women, for police and other emergency services, you take your life into your hands when you enter these areas. \u201d Regarding the journalists who have reported that everything is fine in Sweden Kassam fired back saying, \u201cI can\u2019t tell whether these journalists now are just partisan   or cretinous liars or   who knows? But the fact of the matter is they haven\u2019t been there, they haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s going on. \u201d He then hit out at the lack of integration of the large migrant populations who live in the various   zones and the culture in Sweden that has allowed migrants to \u201cghettoise\u201d in their communities. \u201cThe Swedish government is effectively forcing them to do so by putting them in these housing tenements where they all live together,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can tell [Trump is] right because [the media] came out and said he was wrong within seconds of him saying this. That means they haven\u2019t looked into it, they haven\u2019t researched it, they haven\u2019t read the books on it,\u201d he noted. Shortly after the Swedish government released a statement criticising Trump\u2019s comments the suburb of Rinkeby erupted into riots with multiple cars being set on fire.  According to journalists on the scene, the area looked like a war zone.
