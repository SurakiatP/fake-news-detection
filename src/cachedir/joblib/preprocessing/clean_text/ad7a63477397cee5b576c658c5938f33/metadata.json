[The New York Times] \u2022 We\u2019re in Week 2 of New Year\u2019s resolution month, when we\u2019re helping you stick to your goals. If you joined last week, welcome back. If not, there\u2019s still time to participate. A key to staying motivated is to create habits that take away the opportunity to slip up. This is a concept my colleague Charles Duhigg has explored: \u201cAt the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts: a cue, a routine and a reward. To understand how to create habits  \u2014   such as exercise habits  \u2014   you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards. \u201d This article tells you how to do that. I can attest to the power of this approach, and we want you to try it out yourself. Email us with one habit that would support your resolution, and how you\u2019re going to create it. Near the end of the month, we\u2019ll check back in with some of these and see how you did.  \u2014   Tim Herrera, Smarter Living editor \u2022 Recipe of the day: For a step away from weeknight pasta, try your hand at ricotta gnocchi. \u2022 Cameroon\u2019s national soccer team defeated Egypt to win its fifth Africa Cup trophy. \u2022 After 49 years, the   band Black Sabbath chose Birmingham, England, for what it said was its final concert. \u2022 Esquire magazine, long a men\u2019s bible, looks to chart a new course in an era of transgender bathrooms and pink hats. \u2022 Queen Elizabeth II of Britain celebrates her sapphire jubilee today, marking the 65th year of her reign. \u2022 Alex Lewis lost his arms and legs to a blood infection.

Last week, the actor Peter Capaldi made headlines when he announced he would be leaving his starring role on \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d the   British television series about a   alien. The Doctor  \u2014   who isn\u2019t referred to as Doctor Who  \u2014   is a Time Lord from a distant planet who explores the universe in a time machine called the Tardis (which stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space). A plucky human companion usually accompanies the Doctor, who faces a rotating cast of alien adversaries. Originally conceived as a   educational program, the series began in 1963 and, with the exception of a   gap ( ) has been broadcast since. The show is a national institution in Britain and a cult favorite elsewhere in the world, with more than 800 episodes (a Guinness world record). The Doctor is capable of regenerating, a concept that was introduced to prolong the series when its first lead actor, William Hartnell, left amid failing health. Mr. Capaldi, above, is the 12th actor  \u2014   and the 12th white man  \u2014   to fill the role. Fans have urged the producers to address the lack of diversity when the 13th Doctor makes his  \u2014   or her  \u2014   debut.
