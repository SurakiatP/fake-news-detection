The more public one involves the Rio Games, where Neymar, 24, will try to restore Brazil\u2019s flagging soccer esteem. The country most synonymous with the sport has won five World Cups but never an Olympic gold medal. An opening   tie against South Africa on Thursday did nothing to heal lingering trauma from a devastating   loss to Germany at the 2014 World Cup, a national shame that even Neymar\u2019s mother can refer to only euphemistically as \u201cthe situation. \u201d But Neymar is also attempting to resuscitate his ravaged childhood neighborhood in Praia Grande, a coastal city an hour outside S\u00e3o Paulo. The area surrounding his youth institute is beatifically called Garden of Glory, but it is a poor and dangerous community troubled by drugs, prostitution and a lack of good schools and jobs. The facility, with its classrooms, turf fields and high white walls, opened in December 2014, a few blocks from where Neymar once lived on B Street, playing soccer on a road that was not yet paved. He spent more than $6 million of his own money to build the institute, in addition to securing sponsors, officials at the institute said. Each day, before school or after, 2, 400 boys and girls ages 7 to 14 come at no cost for two hours. They read and write and work on computers and study English, Spanish and Portuguese. Older children come at night. Parents are invited, too, for vocational training. A dentist and doctors are available. On Wednesday, 32 children were given eyeglasses free of charge, officials said. And dozens rehearsed for Friday\u2019s ceremony, twirling ribbons in the colors of the Olympic rings and preparing paper flags representing 78 countries. During the Rio Games and the Paralympics, the boys and girls will participate in a   featuring soccer, basketball, volleyball, swimming and judo. But institute officials stressed that this is a facility for developing opportunity, not athletes. \u201cIt is not a soccer school,\u201d said Altamiro Bezerra, the institute\u2019s finance director. \u201cNeymar\u2019s family wants to change the conditions here and give these children the basics: health and education and hope. When you are young, you need to believe in the future, that there is something good in the end. \u201d Away from this neighborhood, where Neymar lived from about 7 to 13, he has a more complicated relationship with Brazil. He is one of the world\u2019s best players, elegant and cunning, immensely popular with his 55. 9 million followers on Instagram. Playing alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez in a fearsome front line at the Spanish club Barcelona, he won a European Champions League title in 2015 after beginning his career at Santos, the Brazilian club made famous by Pel\u00e9. And yet, while wearing the yellow, green and blue of Brazil\u2019s national team, Neymar is also a reminder of elusive success, even in his absence. He was not chosen as an    for the 2010 World Cup, when Brazil fizzled in the quarterfinals. He sat out with a broken vertebra in his back when Brazil lost to Germany in the semifinals in 2014. And at Barcelona\u2019s request that he play only one tournament this summer, he vacationed during the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in June. Without him, Brazil was ousted in group play and the team\u2019s coach, Dunga, was fired. Recent    news about Neymar has also not always been flattering. In March, the Brazilian news media reported that he had been found guilty of tax fraud by a federal court in Rio in a case related to contracts with Santos, Barcelona and Nike. According to the reports, he was ordered to repay about $52 million in fines and back taxes. He has said he paid all the taxes he owed. After being grilled by reporters about his partying with  celebrities during the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Neymar said it was his business what he did on vacation. Tartly, he asked reporters: \u201cImagine you\u2019re 24 years old, earning what I earn and having all that I have. Wouldn\u2019t you be the same as me?\u201d An Olympic gold medal would give Neymar a prize that even Pel\u00e9 does not have. But Neymar also may need to deliver the gold to reaffirm his status as a superstar athlete and product endorser, said Milton Neves, a sports commentator at the Brazilian TV network Bandeirantes. \u201cNeymar needs to win the Olympic gold medal more than the Brazilian team needs to,\u201d Neves said. Soccer gold may be the most coveted prize for Brazil at the Rio Games, but it is only one of 28 sports, and it is not the spotlight event that it is at the World Cup. The men\u2019s Olympic tournament is for players under 23 years of age, with three older players permitted on each team. Unlike the World Cup, Thursday\u2019s opening match did not inspire people nationwide to leave work and gather in their yellow shirts and jerseys. Few sat at beach bars here, or in nearby Santos, to watch the game. Brazil could not muster a goal, even though South Africa played   after one of its players was ejected with 30 minutes remaining. \u201cFor us, the draw is a defeat,\u201d Neymar told reporters. The Olympics arrive with Brazil engulfed in political and economic crises. Even a close friend of Neymar\u2019s, Ciro Lopes, said he would not open his bar in Santos early for Thursday\u2019s afternoon match. \u201cWith the economic crisis,\u201d Lopes, 51, said, \u201cpeople don\u2019t have money. \u201d At the Neymar Jr. Institute, Ana Paula dos Santos made the sign of the cross Wednesday as she came to deliver an Olympic   to her granddaughter. If Brazil wins soccer gold, \u201cit would cleanse my soul,\u201d she said. \u201cI could sleep peacefully. \u201d She was referring to the   loss to Germany two years ago, Brazil\u2019s biggest defeat ever in the World Cup. The match, when it is spoken of at all, is simply referred to in dreary shorthand by its score: Sete a Um. Nadine Goncalves, 49, Neymar\u2019s mother and the chief executive of his youth institute, said that as she watched that match at home with her injured son, she could see questioning in his face along with shock and sorrow: \u201cWhat if I was there? Would I have been able to change what happened?\u201d More than a match was lost that day. A brightness about Brazilian football dimmed, along with a certainty that flair and improvisation could always overcome an opponent\u2019s technical and tactical resistance, said Flavio de Campos, a professor of the sociocultural history of soccer at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cPeople pinned their hopes on this magic thing that we believe our soccer has,\u201d de Campos said. Many, probably most, Brazilians believe that an Olympic gold medal would come nowhere close to redeeming the embarrassment of the 2014 World Cup. \u201cErase  ? Never,\u201d Nilson Luiz de Marco, 56, said as he stood near the Neymar Jr. Institute. \u201cThe only way is if we play Germany again and win  . \u201d Germany is also playing in the Olympic tournament, which could give Brazil a chance at an emancipating victory, or  \u2014   shudder  \u2014   another stunning defeat. If that happened, Bezerra, the Neymar Institute official, said with gallows humor, \u201clet\u2019s move to Germany. \u201d The children at the institute seemed far more excited about the   than any outcome at the actual Olympics. Guilherme Sousa Gomes, 9, said: \u201cThis place is safe. Outside it\u2019s not safe. There are a lot of robbers walking around. \u201d Giovanna Moreira Andrade, 10, said her mother got a job showing other women how to apply makeup after taking a vocational class at the institute. Her life had gone \u201cfrom worse to better,\u201d she said. Her family has bought a barbecue grill, and she dreams of a pool.'"}, "time": 1742562589.3133695}
