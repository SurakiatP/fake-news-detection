As the   folk singer forewarned, he was not there to receive the 2016 prize in literature, but he sent a warm, humble statement accepting the honor, which was read by Azita Raji, the American ambassador to Sweden, at an evening banquet in Stockholm. Invoking William Shakespeare, whom Mr. Dylan imagined to have been too consumed with practical matters  \u2014   \u201cHow should this be staged?\u201d \u201cWhere am I going to get a human skull?\u201d  \u2014   to bother with whether what he was doing was literature, Mr. Dylan wrote: \u201cI too am often occupied with the pursuit of my creative endeavors and dealing with all aspects of life\u2019s mundane matters. \u2018Who are the best musicians for these songs?\u2019 \u2018Am I recording in the right studio?\u2019 \u2018Is this song in the right key?\u2019 Some things never change, even in 400 years. \u201cNot once have I ever had the time to ask myself, \u2018Are my songs literature? \u2019\u201d Mr. Dylan, 75, concluded. \u201cSo, I do thank the Swedish Academy, both for taking the time to consider that very question, and, ultimately, for providing such a wonderful answer. \u201d Earlier in the day, the Swedish Academy defended its nontraditional selection of a musician  \u2014   and a seemingly uninterested one, at that  \u2014   for the literary honor. (In his prepared remarks, Mr. Dylan would acknowledge his own inscrutable silence for two weeks after the prize was announced in October: \u201cI was out on the road when I received this surprising news, and it took me more than a few minutes to properly process it. \u201d) In a speech in front of about 1, 500 guests, including the Swedish royal family, Horace Engdahl, a member of the Nobel Committee, called Mr. Dylan \u201ca singer worthy of a place beside the Greek bards, beside Ovid, beside the Romantic visionaries, beside the kings and queens of the blues, beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards. \u201cIf people in the literary world groan,\u201d Mr. Engdahl added, \u201cone must remind them that the gods don\u2019t write, they dance and they sing. \u201d Mr. Engdahl\u2019s speech was followed by a fittingly imperfect Patti Smith, who delivered an estimable Dylan impression on his 1963 song, \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s   Fall,\u201d but also proved his inimitable nature, flubbing a lyric and halting the performance midway through. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said before resuming. \u201cI\u2019m so nervous. \u201d Still, some in the audience could be seen crying as she finished the song accompanied by a string section. At the same time, Mr. Dylan, who cited only \u201c  commitments\u201d when he finally declined the Nobel invitation, was being spoken about in   terms outside of Stockholm, as well. Exactly where the singer was on Saturday during the Scandinavian festivities  \u2014   which included an evening banquet, with its traditional parade of desserts, after the afternoon   award ceremony  \u2014   remained a mystery. He was not where he can most reliably be found these days  \u2014   onstage  \u2014   as his most recent batch of tour dates ended before Thanksgiving. But even with no public appearances scheduled, Mr. Dylan was also a spectral presence around his other, more private, known haunts. Neighbors at properties across the country that are registered in Mr. Dylan\u2019s name or that of his management company described a local legend who was hard to pin down and rarely, if ever, seen  \u2014   somewhere between Thomas Pynchon and Sasquatch. Outside of a gated home in Malibu, Calif. owned, according to local tax records, by Robert Dylan, a   security guard offered cryptically, \u201cWhat you\u2019re looking for doesn\u2019t exist here anymore. \u201d Locals, however, described the folk legend as a   presence who had been seen intermittently in recent years. On Saturday morning during the Nobel ceremony, the home where Mr. Dylan is thought to live received visitors, including a white pickup truck advertising plumbing services. Two S. U. V.s also gained entrance beyond the prominent \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign and security cameras, but a voice on the intercom denied Mr. Dylan was inside. About 2, 000 miles away, in Hanover, Minn. a few hours south of his native Hibbing, Mr. Dylan\u2019s legend also loomed, though his corporeal presence remained elusive. At a property associated with Mr. Dylan\u2019s companies, where his brother, David, is thought to live, a private drive lined with pine trees led to multiple buildings decorated for the holidays with lights and blowup Christmas characters. A   down the road was the Hilltop Bar, the one place in town that locals could agree Mr. Dylan had patronized. But the owner, who declined to give his name, said he had not served Mr. Dylan in a few years. Nearby, at the Tom Thumb gas station, there were whispers that Mr. Dylan had been around town over Thanksgiving, though no one could say why he missed the Nobel events, which also included news conferences and an earlier meeting with President Obama. Still, Mr. Dylan has not yet entirely ducked the Swedish Academy. To receive the award, which comes with 8 million Swedish krona, or about $870, 000, Nobel laureates are required to give a lecture on their subject within six months of Saturday\u2019s ceremonies, and though the academy said it had nothing on the books yet, there was hope. \u201cThere is a chance that Bob Dylan will be performing in Stockholm next year, possibly in the spring,\u201d the academy said in a statement, \u201cin which case he will have a perfect opportunity to deliver his lecture. We will post more information as soon as we have it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562129.660391}
