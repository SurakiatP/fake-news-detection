GATES: Broadly philosophically, I\u2019m in agreement with his disruptive approach. So in government, I\u2019m a strong believer in the need for reform of government agencies and departments. They have gotten fat and sloppy and they\u2019re not  . They are inefficient. They cost too much. I also think on the foreign policy side that there is a need for disruption. We\u2019ve had three administrations follow a pretty consistent policy toward North Korea, and it really hasn\u2019t gotten us anywhere. So the notion of disrupting and putting the Chinese on notice that it\u2019s no longer business as usual for the United States I think is a good thing. Now the question is, obviously, in the implementation of disruption. On the foreign policy side, there\u2019s the risk of being too spontaneous and too disruptive where you end up doing more harm than damage. Figuring out that balance is where having strong people around you matters. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563512.7564867}
