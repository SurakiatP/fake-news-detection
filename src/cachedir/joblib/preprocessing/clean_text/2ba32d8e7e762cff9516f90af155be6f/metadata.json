But there is one exception. Tesla, the   upstart, continues to surge. On Monday, Tesla surpassed Ford Motor in market value for the first time and moved within striking distance of General Motors, starkly illustrating the growing gap in investors\u2019 optimism over its future versus the prospects for the traditional carmakers from Detroit. While G. M. and Ford may have strong profits and healthy balance sheets, Tesla offers something Wall Street loves much more: the potential for dramatic growth. \u201cInvestors want something that is going to go up in orders of magnitude in six months to six years, and Tesla is that story,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cNobody thinks Ford or G. M. is going to do that. \u201d Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has shattered the conventional wisdom that automakers should be viewed as a stable, reliable investment. Instead, he promotes his   company as a dynamic vehicle for growth, despite the risks and challenges ahead of it. In his vision, Tesla is going to change the world, and is primed to cash in on the two transformative trends in the industry: the shift to electric vehicles as part of a broader societal move to cleaner energy, and the advent of automated driving. \u201cTesla is very vocal in talking about how they are positioned as we move from humans driving cars powered by gasoline to computers driving cars powered by batteries,\u201d Mr. Brauer said. At the end of Monday\u2019s trading, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $48. 7 billion compared with Ford\u2019s $45. 6 billion, according to Bloomberg. General Motors was at $51. 2 billion. Tesla\u2019s market milestone came at the intersection of two countervailing trends. On Sunday, Tesla said its   sales were up 69 percent from the same period a year ago. On Monday, monthly sales figures for the conventional automakers showed them struggling to meet last March\u2019s performance. That sent stocks in the Detroit automakers down for the day  \u2014   G. M. was off 3. 4 percent and Ford 1. 7 percent  \u2014   while Tesla\u2019s stock soared by more than 7 percent. Despite the recent boom years for the American motor industry, in which G. M. and Ford have been the biggest beneficiaries, executives are working overtime just to convince Wall Street that their business model can produce incremental improvements. Mr. Brauer said that reception was unfortunate for G. M. and Ford because \u201cthe reality is, they\u2019re as financially healthy as they\u2019ve ever been, and they\u2019re in very good position for the future. \u201d Both companies have rebounded steadily since the recession, although G. M. needed a bankruptcy filing and $49 billion government bailout to recover. And both have taken advantage of the   consumer demand for new vehicles in recent years, especially for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But neither automaker has convinced Wall Street that it has shed its    reputation tied to broader economic cycles, or is at the forefront of new technology being developed for   vehicles and electric cars. The Detroit automakers are hardly sitting still in their efforts to improve current results and future prospects. G. M. made the momentous decision recently to sell its   European division, and Ford is adding jobs to accelerate its shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles. Both automakers have bought technology companies to bolster their   engineering expertise, and their executives have embraced the chance to work with the Trump administration on scaling back government regulations. All the same, both companies are ranked near the bottom in    ratios for the companies that make up the Standard  Poor\u2019s 500 index. Last week, one of G. M.\u2019s large investors, the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, proposed the creation of two classes of stock  \u2014   one that strictly pays dividends, and a second tied directly to earnings and future growth in areas like   cars and   services. G. M. directors flatly rejected the idea as too risky, and the chief executive, Mary Barra, said there was no need to deviate from \u201cexecuting a plan that is delivering record financial and operation results. \u201d Yet while industry analysts generally supported the decision, G. M.\u2019s share price barely budged on the news that it was staying the course. And Monday\u2019s data, showing total industry sales off 1. 6 percent, underscored that overall demand for new vehicles is slipping despite a bevy of discounts and incentives. G. M. showed a slight gain from the prior March, while Ford sales fell sharply. Several other automakers, such as Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai, also reported declines. Of course, based on the number of cars actually being made, they are in a different league from Tesla. G. M. sold 256, 000 vehicles in the United States last month, and Ford 234, 000. Tesla\u2019s sales for the same period: 4, 000. But it was the growth and the outlook, not the raw numbers, that moved the markets. Investors tend to look at Tesla as a technology   rather than an automaker. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Tesla is positioned in people\u2019s minds as an energy storage company that happens to put most of its batteries on wheels,\u201d said Andrew Stewart, chief investment officer at Exchange Capital Management, an investment firm in Ann Arbor, Mich. Tesla is also prone to more volatile stock movements because Mr. Musk and other board members and top executives own a large chunk of shares, leaving a relative few that change hands frequently, he said. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s interesting news, the people trying to buy are buying from a limited number of people who are willing to sell,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cWhile you have Ford and G. M. and they\u2019re these     industrial companies. \u201d Because of Tesla\u2019s acclaim and the limited number of shares being traded, the company draws more individual investors, and its share price tends to spike whenever Tesla or Mr. Musk makes news. This week\u2019s jump in its stock price was set off by a brief news release on Sunday that said Tesla had delivered more than 25, 000 cars in the first quarter, exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates. While Tesla may enjoy the favor of investors, it still faces some daunting hurdles to reach its goals. This summer, the company is supposed to start making the Model 3, a compact electric model that Tesla plans to sell for $35, 000 and produce in significantly higher volumes. It currently offers two vehicles, the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X S. U. V. both of which sell for $90, 000 or more when options are added in. (People who buy its cars benefit from a $7, 500 federal tax credit on environmentally friendly cars, a selling point with an uncertain future.) Once Tesla begins producing the Model 3, Mr. Musk expects production to ramp up quickly, with a goal of making 500, 000 cars a year by 2018. Achieving that target will not be easy, Mr. Brauer said. \u201cThat\u2019s five times growth in volume,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any car company that\u2019s ever done that in a   period. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563249.9453752}
