Mr. Fillon, who won November\u2019s   primary, has been considered a favorite in the race, but now must contend with questions about whether the payments to his wife were inappropriate. According to the satirical weekly The Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9, Mr. Fillon\u2019s wife, Penelope, received about 500, 000 euros over eight years, first as his parliamentary assistant and then as assistant to his deputy Marc Joulaud, who took over when Mr. Fillon became a minister in the government in 2002. It is not illegal in France for members of Parliament to employ family, and around 10 to 15 percent do so, according to French media. But if Mrs. Fillon did nothing, holding a fake job, in effect, in return for the public funds, her husband could be in trouble. \u201cThis could be painful to Fillon, fairly damaging,\u201d G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a political scientist at   the prestigious political science institute, said Wednesday in an interview. He added: \u201cEverything depends on whether it was a bogus job. If it\u2019s proved that it was  \u2014   and a   one, too  \u2014   then this is going to be important. She always said she didn\u2019t participate in political life. So she sort of condemned herself in advance. \u201d Mr. Fillon, the   candidate, has been leading in polls, ahead of his two main challengers, Marine Le Pen of the   National Front, and the former economy minister in the Socialist government, Emmanuel Macron, who is running as an independent. The general election is in April, with a runoff expected in May. Either Ms. Le Pen  \u2014   most likely  \u2014   or Mr. Macron will wind up in the presidential runoff against Mr. Fillon, analysts have predicted. In a 2012 posting on Twitter, Mr. Fillon denounced those who \u201cdon\u2019t work and receive public money,\u201d in what has become a principal theme of his campaign. But in its investigation, The Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 quoted another of Mr. Joulaud\u2019s assistants as saying: \u201cI never worked with her,\u201d adding, \u201cI knew her only as the minister\u2019s wife. \u201d Mrs. Fillon has always told interviewers that she stayed away from politics and devoted herself to the couple\u2019s five children, and to domestic pursuits. Of Welsh origin, Mrs. Fillon has been known for her interest in horses and has been photographed with her family in and around the couple\u2019s chateau in Western France. The affair could be all the more damaging because the image of Mr. Fillon has been based on probity and austerity, and he has called for sacrifices from the French, including cuts to civil servant jobs. Campaigning in Bordeaux on Wednesday, Mr. Fillon angrily denounced the new reports as \u201cstink balls,\u201d saying, \u201cSo, because she\u2019s my wife, she doesn\u2019t have the right to work. \u201d He called the Canard\u2019s report \u201cmisogynist. \u201d On Twitter he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m astonished that these old, and legal, facts have become a story, three months from the first round of presidential voting. \u201d The Socialists criticized Mr. Fillon on Wednesday. \u201cYou can\u2019t call yourself the candidate of honesty, of transparency, and then be unable to explain yourself on these matters,\u201d said Manuel Valls, one of two in the Socialists\u2019 primary runoff on Sunday. The Canard also reported that Mrs. Fillon had been paid 5, 000 euros a month over a year and a half by a wealthy friend of Mr. Fillon\u2019s, Marc Ladreit de Lacharri\u00e8re, who owns The Revue des Deux Mondes, an   political review. The newspaper suggested that Mrs. Fillon had in fact done little work in return for the pay.'"}, "time": 1742563246.5889878}
