This time it has to do with a prediction he made about Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal. \\nOn Friday, the FBI announced in a letter to Congress that they were reopening the Clinton email investigation in light of emails unearthed in their investigation of disgraced former New York Democrat Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting an underage girl. \\nOn Aug. 29, not long after top Clinton aide Huma Abedin announced that she and Weiner were separating, Trump released a statement. \u201cHuma is making a very wise decision,\u201d Trump said. \\n\u201cI only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,\u201d he added. \u201cWho knows what he learned and who he told?\u201d Trump, in July: \"I don\\'t like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.\u201d https://t.co/qICt22PfzM \\n\u2014 Ryan Teague Beckwith (@ryanbeckwith) October 28, 2016 And once again Trump was right months ago about Hillary compromising national security by having ties to Anthony Weiner #CantStumpTheTrump pic.twitter.com/5GIBJJ4a2m \\n\u2014 Jared Wyand \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JaredWyand) October 28, 2016 Trump on Weiner (back in July before Huma Abedin and Weiner separated) pic.twitter.com/GItJHH9hVr \\n\u2014 Ashley Killough (@KilloughCNN) October 28, 2016 #tbt the first time Trump attacked Weiner at a campaign event was August 2015 https://t.co/YwGn1YnZUu \\n\u2014 Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) October 28, 2016 \\nThe Washington Examiner reported : \\nAfter the bombshell report about the FBI\u2019s reopened investigation first emerged Friday afternoon, the New York Times reported that the \u201cnew emails\u201d that have led investigators to take a second look at the case were discovered on devices seized from Abedin and Weiner\u2019s home during a separate investigation into Weiner\u2019s alleged sexting with a minor. \\nComey, in a letter to eight Republican congressional committee chairs, did not clarify what emails led him to revisit the Clinton case. He said only that investigators had recently briefed him on \u201cthe existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information,\u201d Comey wrote. \\nTrump told a crowd in New Hampshire on Friday he hopes the FBI will \u201cright the ship\u201d after the agency declined to indict Clinton in July, citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent. \\nTrump has been proven right to the point that the mainstream media even had to admit how right he was. That\u2019s saying something. \\nIt will be very interesting to see what the FBI has found/will find in their investigation. The FBI certainly could be reopening the investigation to somehow help Clinton \u2014 perhaps there\u2019s an angle that makes this the better option \u2014 or maybe there is something so potentially damning that even they couldn\u2019t figure out a good way to bury it. That seems fairly unlikely, but it\u2019s hard to say. \\nOnce again, Trump has been proven right and that\u2019s largely because he gets it. Trump has called himself a \u201ccommon sense conservative\u201d and the many times he\u2019s been proven right on the campaign trail, along with the many policy positions he\u2019s taken that show that he is in touch with Americans and has common sense, prove this label correct.'"}, "time": 1742628557.2257562}
