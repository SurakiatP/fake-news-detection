The answer? Nothing. Look harder. The tiny flecks are everywhere. An international team found that rooftops and other cityscapes readily collect the extraterrestrial dust in ways that can ease its identification, contrary to science authorities who long   the idea as little more than an urban myth kept alive by amateur astronomers. Remarkably, the leader of the discovery team  \u2014   and   of a recent paper in Geology, a monthly journal of the Geological Society of America  \u2014   turns out to be a gifted amateur who devoted himself to disproving the skeptics. A noted jazz musician in Norway, he rearranged his life to include eight long years of extraterrestrial sleuthing. His hunt has now produced a significant discovery, a colorful book for lay readers and what scientists call a portrait gallery of alien visitors. \u201cI hope and believe this will start something,\u201d the musician, Jon Larsen, said in an interview. His goal? \u201cMaking it easy. \u201d His book, \u201cIn Search of Stardust: Amazing   and Their Terrestrial Imposters,\u201d due out in August, details the secret of his extraordinarily successful hunts. Its 150 pages and 1, 500 photomicrographs, or photos taken through a microscope, tell how Mr. Larsen taught himself to distinguish cosmic dust from the minuscule contaminants that arise from roads, shingles, factories, roof tiles, construction sites, home insulation and holiday fireworks. As his book puts it, \u201cTo pick out one extraterrestrial particle among billions of others requires knowledge both about what to look for and what to disregard. \u201d The diminutive flecks to which Mr. Larsen, 58, has devoted himself represent the smallest parts of a cosmic downpour that has lashed the Earth for billions of years. Careful observers of the night sky are familiar with shooting stars  \u2014   speeding bits of extraterrestrial rock that plunge through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, often burning up completely. The biggest can strike the ground, some forcefully enough to dig craters. In 2013, a relatively small rock exploded over the Russian city Chelyabinsk, releasing a shock wave that injured hundreds of people, mainly as windows shattered into flying glass. But all that represents a tiny fraction of the downpour. Scientists say most of the cosmic material is remarkably small  \u2014   barely the width of a human hair. Known as micrometeorites, they rain down on the planet more or less continuously but have proved remarkably hard to find. Some bits are so small and lightweight that they drift down to the Earth\u2019s surface without melting. The dust consists of tiny remnants from the solar system\u2019s birth, including debris from the lumps of dirty ice known as comets and from ages of smashups among planets and the big rocks known as asteroids. While most of the particles are interplanetary in nature, some contain grains of matter from outside the solar system, or true stardust. Their diversity makes them excellent windows on the cosmos. Scientists have found micrometeorites mainly in the Antarctic, remote deserts and other places far from civilization\u2019s haze. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, investigators tried to find them in urban areas but eventually gave up because of the riot of human contaminants. Significantly, it turns out that specialists trying to establish the cosmic origins of the tiny specks have tended to examine their chemical signatures rather than their overall appearance. That left a large opening for Mr. Larsen. Matthew J. Genge, one of the Geology paper\u2019s four authors and a senior lecturer in earth and planetary science at Imperial College, London, used an electron microprobe at the Natural History Museum in London to determine the chemical makeup of Mr. Larsen\u2019s finds and confirm their cosmic origin. In an interview, he said that, over all, the grains that survive the atmospheric plunge and land on the Earth\u2019s surface add up to more than 4, 000 tons annually, or more than 10 tons a day. \u201cHe\u2019s done a valuable thing in classifying the contaminants,\u201d Dr. Genge said of Mr. Larsen\u2019s work. \u201cIt has   implications. \u201d Donald E. Brownlee, an astronomer at the University of Washington who helped establish the field, called Mr. Larsen a true citizen scientist whose work will aid the global hunt for the tiny specks. \u201cYour car is covered with cosmic dust,\u201d Dr. Brownlee said. \u201cWe inhale this stuff. We eat it every time we eat lettuce. But normally, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to find. \u201d Mr. Larsen came to what he calls Project Stardust as a jazz guitarist in Norway, perhaps known best as the founder of Hot Club de Norv\u00e8ge, a string quartet. His group helped spur the global revival of gypsy jazz. As Mr. Larsen tells the story, he was an enthusiastic rock collector as a child but did so well as a musician that he set aside his early scientific ambitions. Then, in 2009, at a country house outside Oslo, he was cleaning an outdoor table when a bright speck caught his eye. \u201cIt was blinking in the sunlight,\u201d he recalled. He touched the fleck. \u201cIt was angular in some way, kind of metallic but so small  \u2014   a tiny dot. \u201d Intrigued, Mr. Larsen suspected it was a cosmic visitor and began to look for more. He collected dust samples from Oslo and cities around the globe, moonlighting as a scientist while vacationing or touring with his jazz group. He took samples from roads, roofs, parking lots and industrial areas. Put indelicately, he collected hundreds of pounds of dreck  \u2014   sludge from drains, gutters and downspouts, the dregs of civilization that most people try to avoid. \u201cStill, I didn\u2019t find a single micrometeorite,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was very frustrating. \u201d Mr. Larsen then changed tactics. Rather than looking exclusively for cosmic dust, he taught himself how to classify the dozens of different kinds of earthly contaminants, starting a process of elimination that slowly narrowed the candidates and raised the chances that some tiny fraction of the urban debris might turn out to belong to the cosmos. The breakthrough came two years ago. In London, Dr. Genge studied one of the gathered particles  \u2014   from Norway, not Timbuktu  \u2014   and confirmed that it was indeed a traveler from outer space. Mr. Larsen quickly identified hundreds more. \u201cOnce I knew what to look for, I found them everywhere,\u201d he said. In the Geology paper, the scientific team reports the discovery of about 500 micrometeorites  \u2014   collected mainly from roof gutters in Norway  \u2014   and tells of the detailed analysis of 48 of the extraterrestrial specks. The team includes two of Dr. Genge\u2019s students, Martin D. Suttle of Imperial College and Matthias Van Ginneken of the Universit\u00e9 Libre in Brussels. The team described the cosmic dust as the youngest collected to date, because gutters tend to get cleaned fairly regularly. Also, urban surfaces are recent arrivals in the global landscape compared to polar ice and ancient deserts. In his travels, Mr. Larsen recently visited with Michael E. Zolensky, an extraterrestrial materials scientist in Houston at the Johnson Space Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. They not only talked shop but also went up to the roof of the large building that houses rocks from the Apollo moon program. \u201cIt was pretty cool,\u201d Dr. Zolensky said. \u201cThe curation building is now a collector of cosmic dust. \u201d In an interview, Mr. Larsen described his method  \u2014   sorting through the contaminants in a process of elimination  \u2014   as \u201csomething that anybody can do. It could and should become part of teachings in schools, an aspect of citizen science. \u201d Dr. Brownlee of the University of Washington agreed. He said that, while many schools try to find cosmic dust particles in programs meant to make science classes more inviting and accessible, few if any succeed. \u201cIt could help a lot,\u201d he said of Mr. Larsen\u2019s method. \u201cFor education, it\u2019s pretty cool. \u201d Dr. Genge of Imperial College said Mr. Larsen\u2019s techniques, if adopted widely, might also open a new lens on the cosmos. The gravitational pull of the planets, he noted, appear to tug on the dust clouds of the solar system and slowly change their orbits. He said a wave of new terrestrial finds could help scientists better map the clouds, raising more questions for science about the structure of the universe. \u201cI consider my microscope a telescope,\u201d Dr. Genge said. \u201cIt can give you a pretty big picture. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562063.576261}
