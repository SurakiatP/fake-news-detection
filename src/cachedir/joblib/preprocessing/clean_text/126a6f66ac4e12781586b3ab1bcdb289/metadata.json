The post garnered additional attention after it was translated into English by Palestinian Media Watch, an organization that monitors   and   statements in the Arab news media. The website noted that it was the second time Fatah had made the inaccurate claim. The first was in August 2014. Israelis and Palestinians have long accused each other of incitement to violence. But in Israeli eyes, Palestinian leaders starting with Yasir Arafat, the father of Palestinian nationalism who helped found Fatah in 1959, have had a habit of saying one thing in Arabic and another in English. In the early 2000s, at the height of the second Palestinian uprising, Mr. Arafat led crowds in the West Bank city of Ramallah in a chant of \u201cTo Jerusalem, we are going, martyrs in the millions!\u201d days after writing an   article in The New York Times about the Palestinian vision of peace. Mr. Abbas, who succeeded Mr. Arafat, has repeatedly said he supports nonviolent resistance against the Israeli occupation. But Fatah has historically championed armed resistance as a central tenet of its doctrine for the liberation of the Palestinian people. Fatah is now a large and unwieldy movement, and its activists often make statements that do not reflect Mr. Abbas\u2019s position. \u201cPresident Abbas\u2019s party boasts about committing mass murder and yet it is called \u2018moderate\u2019 by many,\u201d said David Keyes, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. \u201cImagine if Palestinian leaders spent their time praising coexistence instead of terror. \u201d Husam Zomlot, the strategic affairs adviser to Mr. Abbas, first questioned whether the Facebook page was official, and then said it was probably the work of some \u201c  youths. \u201d Mr. Zomlot said that Israeli officials frequently wrote incendiary Facebook posts, and that Fatah\u2019s concerns were elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019m from Fatah and one of its leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe present a complete political platform, and the most important thing is to end the Israeli occupation. \u201d The comments on the official Fatah Facebook page came in the context of coming local and municipal elections that are expected to be held on Oct. 8. The prospect of the elections is already whipping up strong emotions. They will be the first to be held in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a decade since Fatah, the mainstream, secularist party that has long dominated the Palestine Liberation Organization, suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Hamas, the Islamist militant group, in legislative elections in 2006. A year later Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip, routing Fatah\u2019s forces there and confining Mr. Abbas\u2019s influence  \u2014   and that of his   Palestinian Authority, which is largely staffed by Fatah loyalists  \u2014   to parts of the   West Bank. The West Bank and Gaza have since been divided by a bitter schism. Hamas, considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union, refuses to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and has battled Israel several times in recent years. The coming elections are seen as an important barometer of public sentiment in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Fatah activists appear particularly nervous about the elections, because Hamas is widely seen by Palestinians as the less corrupt and more efficient party.'"}, "time": 1742563293.2191849}
