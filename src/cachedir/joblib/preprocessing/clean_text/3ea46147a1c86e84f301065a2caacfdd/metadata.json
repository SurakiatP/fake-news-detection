The Associated Press reports that Pope Francis cautioned against the \u201cvirus of polarization,\u201d telling the new group of cardinals, \u201cwe are not immune from this.\u201d \\nDuring his speech, Pope Francis specifically issued a warning about \u201cour pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose, and condemn\u201d and those who \u201craise walls, build barriers, and label people.\u201d He also encouraged those in attendance to not be so quick to deem those who are different from them an enemy or a threat. \\n\u2018We see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. \\n\u2018The virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.\u2019 \\nPope Francis never called out Donald Trump by name; however, it seems to be more than a mere coincidence that he delivered a speech about accepting immigrants shortly after the United States electorate chose as their leader for the next four years a man who has proposed mass deportation and the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. \\nThis is not the first time that the Pope has spoken out against Donald Trump and his campaign promises, either. In February of this year, when asked about Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, he said , \u201ca person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.\u201d \\nAt least one of the newly appointed cardinals has views similar to Pope Francis\u2019s when it comes to immigration. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin, who was in the news recently for helping to resettle Syrian refugees despite now vice president-elect Mike Pence\u2019s best efforts to block aid to and limit the number of Syrian refugees in Indiana. \\nTobin recently addressed Trump\u2019s victory, saying that, under him, the priority of settling immigrants and refugees \u201cis going to be challenging.\u201d He added, though, that he believes \u201cthe ethical reflection of a nation isn\u2019t reduced to the government\u201d and said that he has \u201ca lot of faith in the American people.\u201d \\nWatch a clip from today\u2019s ceremony, which includes Pope Francis\u2019s remarks, below, via YouTube : \\nFeatured image via Franco Origlia/Getty Images Share this Article!
