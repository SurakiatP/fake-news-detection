Hillary is so pissed, she has been on a tirade, blasting Comey and Donald Trump, but she forgot one thing \u2014 and that is the one person who really screwed her. Hillary Clinton is pissed off. \\nPoor Hillary Clinton, since stepping into the White House back in 1992, she has imagined herself sitting in the Oval Office as the one with all the power. She has conspired and broken laws, killed men in Benghazi, and lied about their deaths, but now, it looks like its all for nothing. \\nIf only she could live in reality for 20 seconds, she would realize the one person who screwed her was staring back at her in the mirror. Everything that has happened is because she decided or rather insisted that all her crimes involving her own home based server be covered up. \\nShe was warned when she became Secretary of State that all emails having to do with government business must go through the \u201cdot gov\u201d system. She had to take a class on how to handle classified documents, and after the class, she had to sign a document confirming that she understood all of her work emails must stay on the \u201cdot gov\u201d system. \\nWhy? Was this just a stupid rule that had no real life consequences? No. People\u2019s lives are at risk. Our troop\u2019s movements are in those emails. The information about CIA spies, who are risking their lives in foreign countries, are in those emails. Who needs a class to understand what is at stake? \\nSo, how can she get pissed off about this investigation and say over and over \u201cit was a mistake, there is no case with the FBI\u201d? A mistake? A mistake is an action or judgment that is misguided or wrong. Intentionally going against all protocols and putting the lives of others in danger is a crime. Hillary Clinton in August 2015 \\nHere\u2019s what Rush Limbaugh said: \\n\u201cThey\u2019ve nominated somebody that\u2019s under constant FBI investigation, and there are four different investigations into the Clinton Foundation. Do not doubt me when I tell you that within the inner circles of the Democrat Party, they are very worried about this. Even if she gets elected, they\u2019re very worried about it, because of what it portends for her presidency. This woman is corrupt. She and her husband are constantly engaged in things that place them under investigation, for 30 years .\u201d [via Rush Limbaugh.com ] \\nHillary is so pissed off, but for those of us who have suffered through watching her tear apart this nation, sell influence to foreign entities in the \u201cpay for play\u201d scandals, leave our men in Benghazi to die while blaming it on a video, and lie under oath numerous times, well, we couldn\u2019t be happier. \\nAmerican women have no business voting for Hillary as the first woman American president. What kind of a legacy is that for our daughters and granddaughters? How will those women who backed her and voted for her ever explain that the first woman president was the biggest criminal ever to hold that office? \\nShe is a monster, and I\u2019m tired of her supporters crying now that it\u2019s falling apart. The only person to blame is Hillary Clinton, and anyone who can\u2019t see her clearly is delusional. No one made her commit crimes that she needed to cover up with a home based server. Put her in prison, where she belongs, and throw away the keys.'"}, "time": 1742561986.0632627}
