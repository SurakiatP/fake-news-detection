Schanberg, a correspondent for The New York Times who won a Pulitzer Prize for covering Cambodia\u2019s fall to the Khmer Rouge in 1975 and inspired the film \u201cThe Killing Fields\u201d with the story of his Cambodian colleague\u2019s survival during the genocide of millions, died on Saturday in Poughkeepsie, N. Y. He was 82. His death was confirmed by Charles Kaiser, a friend and former Times reporter, who said Mr. Schanberg had a heart attack on Tuesday. A restive, intense,   newspaperman with bulldog tenacity, Mr. Schanberg was a nearly ideal foreign correspondent: a   adventurer who distrusted officials, relied on himself in a war zone and wrote vividly of political and military tyrants and of the suffering and death of their victims with the passion of an eyewitness to history. In the spring of 1975, as Pol Pot\u2019s Communist guerrillas closed in on the capital, Phnom Penh, after five years of civil war in Cambodia, Mr. Schanberg and his assistant, Dith Pran, refused to heed directives from Times editors in New York to evacuate the city and remained behind as nearly all Western reporters, diplomats and senior officials of Cambodia\u2019s   Lon Nol government fled for their lives. \u201cOur decision to stay,\u201d Mr. Schanberg wrote later, \u201cwas founded on our belief  \u2014   perhaps, looking back, it was more a devout wish or hope  \u2014   that when the Khmer Rouge won their victory, they would have what they wanted and would end the terrorism and brutal behavior we had written so often about. \u201d But when the guerrillas rolled in, after a brief period of calm, there was widespread shooting, looting and many executions. Mr. Schanberg and Mr. Dith were seized and threatened with death. \u201cMost of the soldiers are teenagers,\u201d Mr. Schanberg noted in his last dispatch. \u201cThey are universally grim, robotlike, brutal. Weapons drip from them like fruit from trees  \u2014   grenades, pistols, rifles, rockets. \u201d Mr. Dith\u2019s pleas saved Mr. Schanberg, and the two journalists took refuge in the French Embassy compound, a vestige of colonial rule. Later, Mr. Dith and other Cambodians were expelled from the compound and forced to join an exodus of civilians into the countryside. It was the beginning of a monstrous social experiment: the expulsion of millions from cities and the suppression of educated classes to recast Cambodia as an agrarian utopia. The failed experiment over the next four years cost the lives of two million people to starvation, disease,   brutality and murder. Two weeks after his capture, Mr. Schanberg and other foreigners were evacuated by truck to Thailand, where he filed the first account of the fall and emptying of Phnom Penh. He told of massacres and fires, of streets and roads littered with bodies, of forced marches that turned the city overnight into a graveyard. \u201cTwo million people suddenly moved out of the city in stunned silence  \u2014   walking, bicycling, pushing cars that had run out of fuel, covering the roads like a human carpet,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA   city became an echo chamber of silent streets lined with abandoned cars and gaping, empty shops. Streetlights burned eerily for a population that was no longer there. \u201d Mr. Schanberg returned to New York. Overwhelmed with guilt over having to leave Mr. Dith behind, he asked for time off to write about his experiences, to help Mr. Dith\u2019s refugee wife and four children establish a new life in San Francisco and to begin the seemingly hopeless task of finding his friend. He was showered with awards, including the Pulitzer, which he said he shared with Mr. Dith. He also became a metropolitan editor and columnist at The Times. For years there was no news of Mr. Dith, who had disguised his educated background and survived beatings, backbreaking labor and a diet of insects, rodents and as little as a tablespoon of rice a day. In 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and replaced Pol Pot with a client regime. Mr. Dith escaped over the border with Thailand in 1979 and was soon reunited with Mr. Schanberg. After moving Mr. Dith and his family to New York and helping him obtain a job as a photographer at The Times, Mr. Schanberg wrote \u201cThe Death and Life of Dith Pran,\u201d a 1980 cover article for The New York Times Magazine, which was later published as a book. The story became the basis for Roland Joff\u00e9\u2019s 1984 movie, \u201cThe Killing Fields,\u201d starring Sam Waterston as Mr. Schanberg and Dr. Haing S. Ngor as Mr. Dith. Dr. Ngor, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor, was a physician who had also survived the Cambodian holocaust. The film was widely praised. \u201c\u2018The Killing Fields\u2019 emerges as an emotionally charged vision of hell on earth, a jolting reminder of the wanton destruction of a gentle people by another of history\u2019s madmen,\u201d Kathleen Carroll wrote in The Daily News. But Vincent Canby of The Times called it \u201cdiffuse and wandering,\u201d adding, \u201cSomething vital is missing, and that\u2019s the emotional intensity of Mr. Schanberg\u2019s   prose. \u201d Sydney Hillel Schanberg was born in Clinton, Mass. on Jan. 17, 1934, to Louis Schanberg, a grocery store owner, and the former Freda Feinberg. Sydney attended Clinton schools and graduated from Harvard in 1955 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in American history. Drafted in 1956, he served as a reporter for an Army newspaper in Frankfurt. He joined The Times in 1959 as a copy boy and became a staff reporter in 1960, covering general assignments and government agencies. In 1964, he began covering the New York State Legislature, and in 1967, he was named Albany bureau chief, in charge of state government reporting. He married Janice Sakofsky in 1967. The couple had two daughters, Jessica and Rebecca, who survive him, and were divorced. In 1995 he married Jane Freiman, who also survives him. Mr. Schanberg joined The Times\u2019s foreign staff in 1969 and was named bureau chief in New Delhi. He covered India\u2019s   war with Pakistan in 1971. He met Mr. Dith on a trip to Phnom Penh in 1972, and as Mr. Schanberg\u2019s reporting from Vietnam and Cambodia grew, The Times hired Mr. Dith as his aide and translator. As the Southeast Asia correspondent from 1973 to 1975, Mr. Schanberg focused increasingly on the Khmer Rouge insurgency. After his foreign assignments, Mr. Schanberg was The Times\u2019s metropolitan editor from 1977 to 1980 and wrote a column twice a week, with a focus on New York, from 1981 to 1985. It was discontinued after he criticized the Times\u2019s coverage of the proposed Westway highway in Manhattan. The Times offered him another assignment, but he left the paper after 26 years to write a column for New York Newsday, where he remained for a decade. Mr. Schanberg, who lived in New Paltz, N. Y. returned to Cambodia in 1989 and 1997 and wrote articles for Vanity Fair. He also wrote for Penthouse and The Nation and columns of media criticism for The Village Voice. \u201cBeyond the Killing Fields,\u201d an anthology of his reporting, was published in 2010. Besides the Pulitzer, he won two George Polk Memorial awards, two Overseas Press Club awards and Sigma Delta Chi\u2019s distinguished journalism prize. \u201cI\u2019m a very lucky man to have had Pran as my reporting partner and even luckier that we came to call each other brother,\u201d Mr. Schanberg said after Mr. Dith died in 2008. \u201cHis mission with me in Cambodia was to tell the world what suffering his people were going through in a war that was never necessary. It became my mission too. My reporting could not have been done without him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628414.0922496}
