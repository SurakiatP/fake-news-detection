The matriarch of a   family on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, Ms. Weisman, then 83, had suffered a serious stroke in June and had spent weeks in two hospitals. Fortunately, she and her husband had drafted advance directives she named her husband, William, to make medical decisions if she became unable to. In August, as her condition deteriorated, Mr. Weisman convened a wrenching family meeting at their Easton home. With the support of their four children, he authorized Medical Orders for   Treatment, known as a Molst form, stating that if his wife\u2019s heart or lungs failed, she should be allowed to die. (In Maryland and most other states, Molst or Polst  \u2014   Physician Orders for   Treatment  \u2014   forms become part of physicians\u2019 orders they apply in every health care setting and provide a clearer guide to patients\u2019 wishes than standard advance directives.) Yet when Ms. Weisman was discovered turning blue in her bed, staff members began to perform CPR, which caused broken ribs and collapsed lungs. They defibrillated her with electric shocks, injected epinephrine and succeeded in reviving her. \u201cMy father was distraught,\u201d said Christian Weisman, the couple\u2019s eldest child. He said his parents \u201chad done everything the way they were supposed to  \u2014   the wills, the advance directives, the Molst. \u201d But when hospital personnel found their patient dying, \u201cthey still violated her wishes. \u201d Mr. Weisman has brought suit against Maryland General for its treatment of his mother, alleging assault, negligence, the \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress\u201d and other claims. Physicians and hospitals have grown accustomed to the threat of lawsuits when they fail to save a patient\u2019s life. Now, some face legal action for failing to let a patient die. Several similar lawsuits around the country say that health care providers disregarded or overrode advance directives, resuscitating people whose instructions clearly said not to. Historically, the practice has been \u201cif in doubt, err on the side of aggressive,   treatment,\u201d said Thaddeus Pope, who directs the Health Law Institute at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minn. After all, resuscitated patients in intensive care can later be disconnected from ventilators, he pointed out, but \u201cyou can\u2019t reverse death. \u201d Courts have seemed unreceptive to what might be labeled   cases. Dr. Pope sees that changing, however, and has compiled several recent examples in the latest Journal of Clinical Ethics. \u201cCourts increasingly accept that unwanted life is also a harm,\u201d he said. \u201cFamilies were showing up at plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys offices in the past and getting turned away. Now, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are taking these cases. \u201d For decades, since the bitter legal battles surrounding Karen Ann Quinlan and Terri Schiavo, Americans have been continually urged to put their    wishes in writing. \u201cState law, federal law, all the medical and advocacy groups  \u2014   everyone sends that same message,\u201d Dr. Pope said. \u201cThere\u2019s this promise. If you document, if you fill out an advance directive, that assures your preferences will be honored. \u201d And when they\u2019re not, patients often bear at least part of the blame. They\u2019ve written vague instructions, perhaps, or left crucial documents at home or in a lawyer\u2019s office. In these recent cases, however, attorneys argue that patients and their appointed agents did everything right  \u2014   and still, patients were subjected to unwanted   actions. In Georgia, Jacqueline Alicea is suing both Doctors Hospital of Augusta and the surgeon who ordered her grandmother, Bucilla Stephenson, 91, placed on a ventilator in 2012. That contravened Ms. Alicea\u2019s verbal instructions as her designated health care agent and Ms. Stephenson\u2019s advance directive declining such   procedures. \u201cIt might as well have been in the garbage can, for all the good it did Ms. Stephenson,\u201d said Harry Revell, Ms. Alicea\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThey ignored and trampled the patient\u2019s rights. \u201d A statement from Doctors Hospital expressed sympathy for the family but said \u201cthe care provided was appropriate and in the best interest of the patient. \u201d While Ms. Alicea was ready to let nature take its course, she initially hesitated to tell doctors to disconnect the machinery that was keeping her grandmother alive. After a week, however, she authorized removal from the ventilator and comfort care her grandmother died three days later. Ms. Alicea\u2019s lawsuit, scheduled for a June trial, seeks approximately $200, 000 in hospital and physician charges (which were largely paid by Medicare) plus punitive damages and lawyers\u2019 fees. A decision in the case last July by the Supreme Court of Georgia, however, may already have consequences for other plaintiffs. The justices denied the defendants\u2019 immunity claims, saying pointedly \u201cit is the will of the patient or her designated agent, and not the will of the health care provider, that controls. \u201d Court decisions like this one may influence later judgments, even in other states. An appellate court decision in California will allow a widow to receive lawyers\u2019 fees in a case involving her husband\u2019s advance directive and efforts by Humboldt County, where the couple lived, to intervene in his care. Dick Magney had appointed his wife, Judith, as his  . Hospitalized in 2015 with a variety of potentially fatal conditions, he opted for palliative care. Then someone at the hospital reported suspected neglect to the county\u2019s adult protective services agency. Judith Magney, 71, and her lawyer spent months fighting the county, which tried to replace Ms. Magney as her husband\u2019s agent, started antibiotics he had earlier declined and briefly appointed a conservator. In an interview, Jeffrey Blanck, counsel to the county, defended those actions on Mr. Magney\u2019s behalf because \u201che was coming in and out of competency\u201d and sometimes agreed to antibiotics. Mr. Magney died in a nursing home in October 2015 at age 74. But his widow\u2019s attempt to force Humboldt County to pay her legal bills continued until California\u2019s First Appellate District issued a blistering opinion last fall. It found that the county had \u201cknowingly and deliberately misrepresented both the law and the facts to the trial court\u201d and granted Ms. Magney attorneys\u2019 fees. Her lawyer, Allison Jackson, has asked for $1. 44 million, including punitive damages. Court clashes over advance directives hardly represent settled law. In these recent cases, \u201cnobody\u2019s gotten a check yet,\u201d Dr. Pope noted. And when cases get settled, as typically happens, the terms often remain confidential, so nobody knows the size of the check. State agencies also penalize nursing homes for resuscitating residents who have do not resuscitate, or D. N. R. orders. They\u2019ve mostly levied paltry fines  \u2014   $1, 370 in Connecticut, $16, 000 in Florida  \u2014   but such actions can affect consumers\u2019 choices of nursing homes. \u201cNow, when you go to Nursing Home Compare, this affects their grades and their reputations,\u201d Dr. Pope said, referring to Medicare\u2019s the government\u2019s online guide to   facilities and nursing homes. In Maryland, the Weisman case has a trial date in November. \u201cI don\u2019t want to suggest there\u2019s evil afoot\u201d by Maryland General, said the Weismans\u2019 lawyer, Robert Schulte. \u201cHer Molst form was right on the top of her chart. They just didn\u2019t bother to look. \u201d William Weisman died about a year after his wife\u2019s discharge, so their son, Christian, filed the lawsuit. It seeks $250, 000 in hospital charges, plus the roughly $180, 000 annual cost of her care from her resuscitation to her eventual death. The suit also insists that the hospital improve its procedures and training for D. N. R. orders. A hospital spokeswoman said in an email that the staff members who resuscitated Ms. Weisman didn\u2019t intentionally disregard her D. N. R. and that Maryland\u2019s highest court has held that being granted life is not an injury. She also noted that \u201cMs. Weisman has made a remarkable recovery. \u201d That\u2019s true  \u2014   thanks to intensive physical therapy and    home care, all paid for out of pocket. Formerly an active bowler and bridge player, Ms. Weisman left Maryland General in November 2013, bedbound and relying on a feeding tube and catheters. Now 86, she lives at home in Easton with revolving shifts of caregivers, eats meals, recognizes family members and is taken to church on Sundays. But dementia makes her confused and afraid, her son said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see my mother each day, but I\u2019m also seeing her suffer each day,\u201d Mr. Weisman said. \u201cShe asks why she\u2019s still here. That\u2019s a difficult thing to answer. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628448.5052269}
