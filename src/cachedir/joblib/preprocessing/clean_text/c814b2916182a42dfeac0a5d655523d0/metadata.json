She stood in the kitchen of the home she built on her family\u2019s farm with Larry Mann, her husband of 46 years, and erupted in tears. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep moving,\u201d she said. On the large dining table were her haunting, evocative photographs taken over the years of the studio in downtown Lexington where her friend, the painter Cy Twombly, had worked. Twombly was born 23 years before Ms. Mann in this same small town in Virginia. In her intimate and elegiac images, some with just the play of light on the wall and floor of the emptied studio, after his death in 2011, it was hard not to feel an acute absence  \u2014   not of one man but two. In June, while preparing an exhibition of these photos, Ms. Mann suffered a sudden and most devastating loss. Emmett, her eldest child, who had struggled with schizophrenia in adulthood, took his own life, at the age of 36. Now the Twombly catalog she is gazing at, and the show, called \u201cRemembered Light,\u201d opening on Sept. 22 at the Gagosian Gallery in Manhattan, are \u201csuffused with grief,\u201d she said. The name Sally Mann is inseparable from the indelible images of her children, Emmett, Jessie and Virginia, in their unfettered youthful play, sometimes naked, in the countryside. In her   memoir, \u201cHold Still,\u201d published last year, Ms. Mann wrote that her family pictures  \u2014   which in the early 1990s became engulfed in morality debates about the depiction of children\u2019s bodies and judgment of Ms. Mann as a mother  \u2014   could not be completely understood outside the context of this farm. The farm is remote and sylvan, with horses grazing alongside the winding drive, dogs underfoot and a menagerie of colorful birds in the greenhouse sharing a glass wall with the open dining area. A communal family space flows into Ms. Mann\u2019s office, with a photograph on her desk of a young Twombly taken by Robert Rauschenberg when they were at Black Mountain College together in 1951. It leads into her studio hung with the familiar,   photographs of Emmett and his sisters in their childhood. \u201cI never separated myself as an artist and a mother,\u201d said Ms. Mann, 65, who has always found her inspiration close to home, \u201cin what William Carlos Williams called \u2018the local,\u2019\u201d she wrote in her memoir. In this local realm she has created photographs of lush Southern landscapes and studies of her husband\u2019s body revealing the effects of his progressive muscular dystrophy. Her art and motherhood \u201cwere really intertwined,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard until I had to defend it. \u201d Inevitably, there will be a chorus that assigns blame to the mother \u201cfor everything,\u201d she added. Ms. Mann has barely ventured off the farm since Emmett\u2019s death. Focusing on the printing of her Twombly images grounded her during the torturous weeks of June. In late July she offered to take a visitor with her on a foray into Lexington, a tour of the markers in Twombly\u2019s life, and, as it turned out, her own. Her first stop would be Walmart, where she said Twombly liked to sit on a bench outside. \u201cOne of the most urbane, sophisticated humans alive, he would just sit there and watch the people come out and look at the mountains,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was fascinated. \u201d Ms. Mann\u2019s kinship with Twombly, whose wry, mentorly presence is woven throughout her memoir, began with her parents. Her father, a country doctor in Lexington for many years, first invited Twombly, then a high school senior, to dinner in the  . As a hostess gift, the artist brought an abstract tabletop sculpture he had crafted from found wood and metal. (That 1946 sculpture was in the first room of Twombly\u2019s 1994 MoMA retrospective.) Early patrons, her parents bought one of Twombly\u2019s   and pencil paintings in 1955 for $150, a transaction that may have occurred on the street. Last year, a 1968 \u201cblackboard\u201d painting set a new auction record for a Twombly work, of just over $70. 5 million at Sotheby\u2019s New York. When Twombly moved back to his hometown in 1993 from Gaeta, Italy, for six months each year, \u201cwe became friends and compatriots and companions and helpmates,\u201d Ms. Mann said. That developed just as Ms. Mann was receiving both acclaim and backlash from critics for photographs of her children. She and Twombly  \u2014   a regular at her Thanksgiving dinners  \u2014   visited back and forth constantly and casually. A record of their admiration for each other as artists  \u2014   and for the creative process  \u2014   is captured in the new exhibition. A painter of grand, abstract canvases cascading with layers of graffitilike script or explosions of vivid color, Twombly set up his studio in the most pedestrian of storefronts in downtown Lexington. \u201cIt was crude as can be, drop ceiling with water stains,\u201d Ms. Mann said of the space that had been the gas company headquarters and then an eye doctor\u2019s office. At Twombly\u2019s suggestion, she began taking pictures there in 1999. \u201cUsually I\u2019m so blinkered when I approach work, but these were done for fun,\u201d said Ms. Mann, who thinks her work shares with Twombly\u2019s a kind of Southern melancholy or \u201cmoldering decadence,\u201d as she put it. She switched from her trademark     view camera to a more nimble digital camera, which she retrofitted with an uncoated antique lens to give the pictures a blinding radiance and flair. \u201cCy would be taking pictures, too,\u201d she said, adding that he once pointed his little Polaroid into the reverse end of her view camera. \u201cHe taught me a lot. He was so loose and free and energetic. \u201d Ms. Mann\u2019s earliest photograph in the Gagosian exhibition focuses on Twombly\u2019s tidy lineup of paints, brushes and stained cloths in a spartan   room. \u201cI had no idea what level of misrule and chaos it would turn into,\u201d she said. Over the sequence, the space becomes densely populated with Twombly\u2019s secondhand finds, including a plastic flamingo and ceramic frog, and white plaster assemblage sculptures, bathed in hazy light filtering through the Venetian blinds. Next, Ms. Mann wanted to visit the Antique Mall that she and Twombly frequented together. She walked through aisles of    and nodded to a deer\u2019s head similar to one in her picture of his cluttered work table. \u201cHe just loved this kitschy stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had such a wide spectrum of embrace, from the sublime to the ridiculous. \u201d Looking at the images, John Ravenal, who organized her 2010 survey \u201cSally Mann: The Flesh and the Spirit\u201d at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, was struck by how Ms. Mann chose not to use her signature   collodion process, which typically gives her images a high degree of distortion and painterly sensuality. \u201cI think that is really a sign of respect,\u201d he said. \u201cThe careful focus on the contents, on the subject matter, is rich enough that it didn\u2019t need this extra layer of abstraction. \u201d Twombly\u2019s studio is now a shop called Old Lex Mercantile. The new owners led Ms. Mann to the back to see   drywall, removed during their renovation. She showed them her photographs of the same wall, intact, in the exhibition catalog. Nicola Del Roscio, director of the Cy Twombly Foundation and the artist\u2019s longtime companion, recalled how Twombly painted a series by tacking a new canvas on top of older ones. He said that the artist appreciated the sounds of street activity and fragments of conversation that would trickle in to the studio. \u201cHe could not survive if he did not do a little trip every day around the countryside,\u201d he said, whether strolling by the mansions of Lexington or making an excursion to Walmart. After Twombly\u2019s death, Mr. Del Roscio asked Ms. Mann to photograph the interior of the artist\u2019s home before its eclectic arrangements were packed up. They include one with an old master print on his mantel behind a framed sign saying \u201cStreet girls bringing in sailors must pay for room in advance. \u201d Today the sign graces Ms. Mann\u2019s studio. Ms. Mann pulled up to the Lexington Restaurant, a diner where Twombly came for the grits and banter. \u201cHe would take really   art people from Europe here,\u201d Ms. Mann said, adding that it was rumored he had left $10, 000 tips for waitresses. Eyeing an older waitress who might provide confirmation, she approached the counter and began chatting her up. A couple of minutes later, Ms. Mann exclaimed loudly, \u201cOh, of course you are!\u201d Slipping back into the booth, Ms. Mann said that 40 years ago the waitress had \u201ctyped my master\u2019s thesis in creative writing, and her daughter babysat for my kids. \u201d And yes, the rumor was true. At the diner, Ms. Mann brought up her son. \u201cEmmett had three terrible brain injuries,\u201d she said. He was hit by a car when he was very young, something she examined in her book. There were two other accidents in adulthood. \u201cThat\u2019s when the schizophrenia took over,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the injuries caused it, or exacerbated it, or if it was genetic. \u201d She felt he had been responding well to treatment, and the family was completely caught off guard by what happened. She asked if we could make a quick stop at Emmett\u2019s house nearby, to retrieve a small bookshelf she wanted to keep. She steeled herself before entering the bungalow. Inside was just a small drift of household items piled to one side. Unflinchingly, she hoisted the humble shelf and walked it to her car trunk. On this day, as in her writing and through her view camera, she stared as squarely as she could, contemplating the passage of time and the transience of life.'"}, "time": 1742561708.565359}
