Even as all other items of the Federal Budget have to submit to strict oversight and austerity and continuously justify every spending, the military budget is the sacred cow that can NEVER be questioned or submit to the same scrupulous and rigorous control. It is unbelievably irrational.'"}, "time": 1742562038.0004926}
