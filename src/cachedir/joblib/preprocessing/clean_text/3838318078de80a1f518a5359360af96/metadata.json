By Marty Townsend on October 27, 2016 Subscribe \\nThe Yale Record , America\u2019s Oldest College Humor Magazine, has NOT endorsed Hillary Clinton \u2013 in a most spectacular way. \\nThe Yale Record is based in the college town of New Haven, Connecticut and was founded by Edward Anthony Bradford , James Heartt VanBuren , Samuel J. Elder , E.H. Lemis , and Henry Ward Beecher Howard in 1872, publishing their first weekly issue on September 11, 1872. They gleefully point readers to their lengthy Wikipedia page to prove their validity, claim the invention of the word \u201chot dog,\u201d and ponder whether the face of the New Yorker would look different if they hadn\u2019t been doing what they\u2019re doing. \\nThe Record adopted \u201cOld Owl\u201d as their mascot over a century ago, but the actual date of acquisition wasn\u2019t recorded anywhere. The mascot , described as a connoisseur of Cutty Sark , is: \u201c\u2026 a congenial, largely nocturnal, 360-degree-head-turning, cigar-smoking bird who tries to steer the staff towards a light-hearted appreciation of life and the finer things in it.\u201d \\nFrom Wikimedia Commons available under a CC Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. \\nWith such an illustrious past, how could anything they produce not be spectacular? Let\u2019s see what Old Owl had to say. \\nThe non-endorsement begins with a simple explanation of why they aren\u2019t endorsing any candidate: \u201cIn its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are \u2018absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.\\'\u201d \\nAnd: \u201cThe Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code.\u201d \\nWith that explained, one would ordinarily assume they were done. But no, they had a bit more to say : \u201cIn particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton\u2019s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country\u2014a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. \u201cThe Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein.\u201d \\nSo there it is\u2026 absolutely the best non-endorsement EVER. \\n\\nFeatured image courtesy of Heat Street .
