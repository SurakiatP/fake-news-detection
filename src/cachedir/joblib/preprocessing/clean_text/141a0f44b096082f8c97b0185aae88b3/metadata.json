According to Turley, the underlying crime isn\u2019t clear given the lack of evidence with the exception of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s indiscretions, which he argued would not warrant special counsel. Turley described it as a \u201c  in search of a crime. \u201d \u201cFor weeks I\u2019ve questioned the need for special counsel because honestly I still don\u2019t see the underlying crime here,\u201d Turley said. \u201cYou know, when we talk about the Russian influence and collusion, there\u2019s not any evidence I\u2019ve seen of collusion but more importantly, no one has articulated a major crime, as opposed to the reporting and registration violations of people like Flynn, which usually wouldn\u2019t warrant a special counsel. But that\u2019s the great mystery here. \u201d \u201cYou know, with Watergate that people have been talking about, there was a serious crime that began that led to the \u201d he continued. \u201cHere you seem to have a   without a crime. That\u2019s what\u2019s so bizarre about the conduct of the White House. It seems to be a   in search of a crime. The problem with the special counsel is what will the special counsel investigate? But having said that, after they fired Comey, my view is that it\u2019s changed, that we do need an independent investigation simply because the White House has created a credibility problem. And lots of Americans believe that there is an effort here to obstruct the investigation. (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561864.0962713}
