Now it emerges that the telecommunications giant is not just eagerly cooperating with the government but also turning a hefty profit \u2014 at taxpayer expense \u2014 in the process. \\nThe New York Times broke the 2013 story about Hemisphere based on a PowerPoint presentation obtained from West Coast police agencies by a Washington state peace activist. The paper described the program as \u201ca partnership between federal and local drug officials and AT&T\u201d whereby \u201cthe government pays AT&T to place its employees in drug-fighting units around the country,\u201d where they \u201csupply [agents] with the phone data from as far back as 1987\u201d on the basis of a subpoena issued by the agency, not a search warrant approved by a judge. \\n\u201cThe scale and longevity of the data storage appears to be unmatched by other government programs, including the N.S.A.\u2019s gathering of phone call logs under the Patriot Act,\u201d the Times wrote, noting that \u201cHemisphere covers every call that passes through an AT&T switch\u201d and \u201cincludes information on the locations of callers.\u201d \\nAs bad as that makes Hemisphere sound, the reality is much worse. The Daily Beast \u2019s Kenneth Lipp reported Tuesday: Hemisphere isn\u2019t a \u201cpartnership\u201d but rather a product AT&T developed, marketed, and sold at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers. No warrant is required to make use of the company\u2019s massive trove of data, according to AT&T documents, only a promise from law enforcement to not disclose Hemisphere if an investigation using it becomes public. \\nAT&T, which owns more than three-quarters of U.S. landline switches and is second only to Verizon when it comes to wireless infrastructure and cellphone towers, \u201cstores details for every call, text message, Skype chat, or other communication that has passed through its infrastructure,\u201d wrote Lipp, adding that this comes to \u201ctrillions of records.\u201d What\u2019s more, the company retains those records much longer than other carriers. \\n\u201cThe database,\u201d penned Lipp, \u201callows its analysts to detect hidden patterns and connections between call detail records, and make highly accurate inferences about the associations and movements of the people Hemisphere is used to surveil.\u201d \\nNot surprisingly, government agencies love having access to this vast treasure trove of data, especially since they can obtain it without a warrant. Thus, even though Hemisphere may initially have been created to fight the unconstitutional war on drugs, its use quickly expanded to other types of investigations, including Medicaid fraud and homicide. \\nHow much does the program cost taxpayers? According to Lipp, \u201cSheriff and police departments pay from $100,000 to upward of $1 million a year or more for Hemisphere access.\u201d And since they love having access to this kind of data, they\u2019ll keep shelling out more for it every year, particularly since Washington is picking up the tab. Harris County, Texas, started out paying the relatively modest sum of $77,924 in 2007; four years later, its annual tab had shot up to $940,000. \\n\u201cDid you see that movie Field of Dreams ?\u201d American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) technology policy analyst Christopher Soghoian asked Lipp. \u201cIt\u2019s like that line, \u2018if you build it, they will come.\u2019 Once a company creates a huge surveillance apparatus like this and provides it to law enforcement, they then have to provide it whenever the government asks. They\u2019ve developed this massive program and of course they\u2019re going to sell it to as many people as possible.\u201d \\nBesides matters of cost, there are \u201cserious Fourth Amendment concerns\u201d and \u201cprofound privacy concerns\u201d with Hemisphere, ACLU deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer told the Times in 2013. That explains why the program is kept so hush-hush. The slides obtained by that newspaper told law enforcement \u201cto never refer to Hemisphere in any official document.\u201d An AT&T statement of work obtained by the Daily Beast says, \u201cThe Government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence.\u201d \\n\u201cI\u2019d speculate that one reason for the secrecy of the program is that it would be very hard to justify it to the public or the courts,\u201d Jaffer told the Times . \\nThat\u2019s why investigators who obtain leads from Hemisphere often turn around and use more legal and constitutional means to obtain the same evidence, a practice known as \u201cparallel construction.\u201d By doing so, they can introduce the evidence in court without revealing where they first obtained it. \\n\u201cAt a minimum there is a very serious question whether they should be doing it [searching Hemisphere] without a warrant,\u201d Electronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney Adam Schwartz told Lipp. \u201cA benefit to the parallel construction is they never have to face that crucible. Then the judge, the defendant, the general public, the media, and elected officials never know that AT&T and police across America funded by the White House are using the world\u2019s largest metadata database to surveil people.\u201d \\nAT&T claims that it is merely complying with lawful requests for data, not doing anything special. Soghoian begs to differ, telling Lipp, \u201cThey say they only cooperate with law enforcement as required, and frankly, that\u2019s offensive when they are mining the data of millions of innocent people, and really built a business and services around the needs of law enforcement.\u201d \\nSome are wondering if these revelations will have any effect on AT&T\u2019s attempt to merge with Time Warner, which has yet to be approved by federal regulators. Reason \u2019s Scott Shackford thinks that, if anything, the fact that AT&T has been so helpful will only play in its favor. \u201cAT&T is essentially the company the federal government made it become,\u201d he wrote, recalling what happened to telecom companies like Qwest that didn\u2019t play ball with Uncle Sam. \u201cImagine them trying to get permission for this merger with Time Warner if they hadn\u2019t been so cooperative with the federal government with surveillance.\u201d \\nAmericans who are concerned about their privacy should keep that in mind. Outrage at AT&T is certainly warranted, but the brunt of their anger should be directed at the politicians and bureaucrats who have created a government with the power to compel \u2014 or at least strongly encourage \u2014 businesses to collaborate in the destruction of our God-given liberties.
