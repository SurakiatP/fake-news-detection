[\u201cI think as an industry, we\u2019re excited about working together with the president and his administration on tax policies, on regulation, and on trade to really create a renaissance in American manufacturing,\u201d Fields told reporters after the meeting, according to the Detroit News.  Fields also praised Trump\u2019s decision to kill former President Obama\u2019s   Partnership trade deal, pointing out that it failed to address currency manipulation. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very vocal both as an industry and as a company, and we\u2019ve repeatedly said that the mother of all trade barriers is currency manipulation, and TPP failed in meaningfully dealing with that, and we appreciate the president\u2019s courage to walk away from a bad trade deal,\u201d Fields said.'"}, "time": 1742563665.4157178}
