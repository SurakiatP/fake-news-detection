[Trump won the election fairly  \u2014   there is not a shred of evidence to suggest otherwise  \u2014   and yet his opponents have never accepted the result, nor ceased trying to frustrate his efforts to govern. If they succeed, American democracy will effectively be finished.  Amidst the giddy enthusiasm of outlets like CNN to report sensational  \u2014   and almost certainly false  \u2014   stories like \u201cSources: White House lawyers research impeachment\u201d  \u2014   little thought is being given to the consequences if their wildest dreams come true. And those who have considered the fact that Vice President Mike Pence would take over  \u2014   like   Sally Kohn and NeverTrumper Bill Kristol  \u2014   assume that Pence will be just as easily dispatched. Straightforward from here:1. Impeach Trump  Pence2. Constitutional crisis3. Call special election4. Ryan v Clinton5. President Clinton,  \u2014   Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) February 15, 2017,  Straightforward from here:1 Joe Lieberman to FBI2 Mueller  Joe do in Trump3 Pence makes Joe VP4 Pence impeached5 President Lieberman,  \u2014   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) May 18, 2017, Trump won nearly 63 million votes. Those voters would be instantly disenfranchised by his removal. Opinion polls suggest nearly all of them would vote the same way again, and no facts have emerged from the Russia conspiracy theory, nor have any major policy betrayals taken place, that would sever that trust. Seeing him deposed would trigger nationwide anger, and perhaps a real \u201cResistance,\u201d not the   \u201cResistance\u201d the left has contrived. Even by considering the possibility of impeaching Trump  \u2014   which some conservatives, rightly, have called a \u201csilent coup\u201d  \u2014   the Beltway elites are sowing division and uncertainty. They have laid bare their contempt for democracy  \u2014   even those who, like Kristol, enthusiastically support imposing democracy abroad. Trump\u2019s voters believed they were taking their country back  \u2014   and did so through the ballot box. God help us if that victory is taken from them. Joel B.
