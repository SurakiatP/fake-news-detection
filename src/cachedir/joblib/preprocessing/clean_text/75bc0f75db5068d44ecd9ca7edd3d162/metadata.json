But Democrats will not be lending a hand anytime soon. Invigorated by the Republican dysfunction that led to a stunningly swift collapse of the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and relieved that President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic accomplishment remains intact, Democrats are in their best position since their embarrassing loss in the November election. While it is far too soon to suggest that the House Republican majority may be imperiled, Democrats are newly optimistic about picking up seats in 2018, hoping to ride a backlash against Mr. Trump. Seeing an opportunity, they say they will not throw Mr. Trump a political life preserver at what they sense could be the first turns of a downward spiral. The president\u2019s approval rating was already mired below 40 percent in some surveys, and is likely to remain low after the health bill\u2019s failure. He has no prospects for legislative victories on the immediate horizon, given how complicated and   his next priority, an overhaul of the tax code, would be even for a more unified party. And while his electoral success in states represented by Democrats in Congress had been thought to put such lawmakers in a vise between their party and their president, Mr. Trump demonstrated no ability to pick off centrist Democrats in his first significant legislative push. Democrats  \u2014     moderates and   liberals alike  \u2014   formed an unbroken front of opposition to the    campaign.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sacrifice our values for the sake of compromise,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cYou think people from red states are going to be for tax reform with 98 percent of tax breaks going to the top 1 percent?\u201d For Democrats, the task of remaining unified was made easier when Republicans decided to go it alone and hastily draft a bill that turned out to be deeply unpopular. But the health care skirmish was also more broadly instructive for a party still finding its footing now that it has lost both the White House and Congress: Being the \u201cparty of no,\u201d it turns out, can pay dividends. \u201cThe unity we had internally, combined with the outside mobilization, really made this success possible,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the top House Democrat. Both Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi insist that they are open to working with Mr. Trump if he shifts to the middle and abandons Republican  . But while Democrats are loath to hold up Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a fierce and calculating opponent, as a role model, his strategy as the Republican leader in denying Mr. Obama bipartisan support is plainly more alluring now. \u201cYou certainly saw the power of united Democratic resistance to the Trump agenda on Friday,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can explain the failure of that bill without the story of a united Democratic and progressive resistance. \u201d Of course, much of the story revolves around the inability of the fractured Republican majority to reach a consensus. But while many Republican lawmakers were under pressure to oppose the health bill, Democratic members of Congress also felt the heat thanks to the new wave of activism in response to Mr. Trump. Though the ability of Democrats to do much more than say no remains limited, their success in helping to thwart Mr. Trump will not only embolden them to confront him again  \u2014   it will also inspire activists to push them to do whatever it takes to block his path. \u201cHaving tasted victory, the resistance forces will feel even more empowered to insist that Democrats continue withholding any cooperation and not granting Trump any victories when he is so wounded,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a Democratic strategist. Still, this rising energy could create internal turbulence for Democrats if activists turn their attention to the next major showdown in Washington: the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. The court battle has not yet engendered the same intensity among activists as the health care bill or Mr. Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration. Some Democratic senators are uneasy about rejecting Judge Gorsuch, preferring to save any fight for an opportunity by Mr. Trump to fill a seat now held by a liberal justice. But the party\u2019s senators may now be pressed to take a more aggressive posture against Mr. Gorsuch, opposition that may not halt his confirmation but would force Senate Republicans to eliminate the filibuster for such nominations. An infrastructure plan may be a safer harbor for Mr. Trump  \u2014   a measure many in Washington are mystified that he did not try to pursue at the outset of his administration. But Mr. Schumer suggested that the president would find Democratic votes only if he defied his party and embraced a huge spending bill, rather than just offering tax incentives for companies to build roads, bridges and railways. \u201cIf he\u2019s only for tax breaks, it will just be a repeat of the health care debate,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. To many Democrats and some Republicans, the resistance on health care was reminiscent of the 2005 clash over Social Security. President George W. Bush sought to overhaul a program covering millions of Americans but suffered a crippling loss when Democrats put up uniform opposition and Republicans backed away in fear of enduring political consequences. There is one major difference, though. \u201cPresident Bush was at 58 percent,\u201d noted Ms. Pelosi, adding that Mr. Trump starts \u201cin a very different place. \u201d But while Mr. Trump\u2019s weakness has Democrats hopeful of making electoral gains in the House, next year\u2019s Senate map offers few opportunities and many hazards. In the House, Democrats need 24 seats to take back the chamber. That deficit could fall to 23  \u2014   coincidentally, the number of   seats in districts that Hillary Clinton carried  \u2014   if Democrats win a special election in Georgia. The vote to fill the suburban Atlanta seat vacated by the new health secretary, Tom Price, will take place on April 18, and the Republicans running are as splintered over how best to confront the Affordable Care Act as their counterparts are in Washington. With Democrats rallying around a   candidate, Jon Ossoff, and the large field of Republicans splitting the vote, some Republican strategists are concerned that Mr. Ossoff may avoid a runoff by winning 50 percent of the vote. House Democrats, hoping to continue their momentum, are planning to pour in more money as part of an effort to drive up Democratic turnout, according to an official with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. If the anger toward Mr. Trump is enough for them to gain a House seat in a   Southern suburb, it may be enough to deliver a wave across a broader area of the country next year in the midterm elections, which often yield gains to the more energized of the two parties. \u201cThere\u2019s a storm that\u2019s going to hit Republicans in 2018,\u201d said Representative Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat. \u201cThe only question is if it is going to be Category 2 or Category 5. \u201d For now, though, Democrats stand to gain simply by standing back and abiding by the maxim of not getting in the way of an opponent who is damaging himself. \u201cOur best shot at stopping the Republicans has always been to let them cannibalize themselves, and this proved that,\u201d Caitlin Legacki, a Democratic strategist, said of the health care fight.'"}, "time": 1742628511.408658}
