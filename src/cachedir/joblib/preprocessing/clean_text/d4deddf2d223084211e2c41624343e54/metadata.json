While noting the significance of the flag and the national anthem, the president said there was a long history of sports figures making political statements. \u201cI think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about,\u201d President Obama said during a news conference in China. \u201cAnd if nothing else, what he\u2019s done is he\u2019s generated more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about. \u201d It was the first time that the president had weighed in on Kaepernick\u2019s actions, which many have criticized as being disrespectful to the United States. Kaepernick, who is biracial and was adopted by white parents, first caused an uproar late last month when he remained seated before a 49ers preseason game with the Green Bay Packers. He said afterward that he would not \u201cstand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. \u201d Last Thursday, before the team\u2019s final preseason game, in San Diego, Kaepernick chose to kneel during the anthem. He later said he intended to continue his protest into the regular N. F. L. season. The 49ers play their first   game next Monday. \u201cOnce again, I\u2019m not \u201d Kaepernick said Thursday. \u201cI love America. I love people. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. I want to help make America better. I think having these conversations helps everybody have a better understanding of where everybody is coming from. \u201d Not long ago, Kaepernick was one of the game\u2019s top players, leading the 49ers to the Super Bowl in the 2012 season and to the N. F. C. championship game the next year. But he was benched halfway through last season and will start the 2016 season as the backup to Blaine Gabbert. Kaepernick was frequently booed during the team\u2019s final preseason game, and the police union in Santa Clara, Calif. has threatened to stop working 49ers home games this season because of Kaepernick\u2019s actions. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is among those who have denounced him. Nevertheless, his stance has also led to numerous expressions of support, with backers arguing that his protest is a worthy statement on the troubled status of race relations in the United States. And even though he is a backup quarterback, his jersey is now the   seller at the N. F. L. \u2019s official online store. Seattle defensive back Jeremy Lane said he would continue to sit for the national anthem when the Seahawks\u2019 regular season begins Sunday at home, The Associated Press reported. After Lane sat during the anthem in the Seahawks\u2019 preseason game last Thursday, he said, Kaepernick reached out to thank him for his support and his gesture. Megan Rapinoe, one of America\u2019s most prominent soccer players, knelt during a National Women\u2019s Soccer League match on Sunday in support of Kaepernick. She told espnW that she was disgusted by how Kaepernick has been treated, and would continue to kneel throughout the season. \u201cQuite honestly, being gay, I have stood with my hand over my heart during the national anthem and felt like I haven\u2019t had my liberties protected, so I can absolutely sympathize with that feeling,\u201d she said. Tim Kaine, the Democratic   nominee, told ABC News that Kaepernick\u2019s rationale \u201cdidn\u2019t really make that much sense to me,\u201d but supported his right to protest. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to respect people\u2019s ability to act according to their conscience, so I wouldn\u2019t presume to tell him what to do,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628596.2476683}
