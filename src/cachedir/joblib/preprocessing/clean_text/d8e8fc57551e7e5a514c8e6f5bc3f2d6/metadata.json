[\u201cThe president, the first lady, and the Secret Service have all made it very clear their view on those thoughts,\u201d Spicer said in response to a question from Breitbart News, asking if the family wanted a personal apology from the comedian:   Melania Trump called the photo \u201cvery disturbing\u201d and questioned Griffin\u2019s mental health. \u201cWhen you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it,\u201d she said in a statement on Wednesday. The president also condemned the photo in a Twitter message. \u201cKathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSick!\u201d During her press conference on Friday, Griffin accused the president and his family of ruining her career and her life after she posed with the photo and said the family \u201cpicked the wrong redhead. \u201d \u201cHe broke me,\u201d Griffin said tearfully.'"}, "time": 1742564301.5833983}
