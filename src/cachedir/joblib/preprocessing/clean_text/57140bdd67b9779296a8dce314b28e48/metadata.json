Perhaps nothing illustrates this better than a new survey showing that far too many \u201cmillennials\u201d are not just cool to \u201ccapitalism,\u201d but are actually cool with communism. As MarketWatch reports : Of the 2,300 Americans polled by YouGov , 80% of baby boomers and 91% of the elderly agree with the statement that \u201ccommunism was and still is a problem\u201d in the world today. Millennials? Only 55%. Furthermore, almost half of Americans between the ages of 16 and 20 said they would vote for a socialist, while 21% would go so far as to back a communist. Capitalism, on the other hand, is viewed favorably by 64% of those over the age of 65, compared with only 42% of millennials. \\nCiting these results, the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation\u2019s Marion Smith stated, as quoted by MarketWatch , \u201cOne of the concerns [the foundation] has had since its establishment is that an emerging generation of Americans has little understanding of the collectivist system and its dark history.\u201d For sure. This was evidenced when a teenager once naively asked me, \u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about communism?\u201d Another registered a look of shock when I gave him part of the answer: During the 20th century, Marxist governments exterminated approximately 100 million people, making them history\u2019s most murderous ideologues. \\nRelated to this, MarketWatch also tells us that \u201ca third of millennials say they believe more people were killed under George W. Bush than Joseph Stalin,\u201d clearly oblivious to Stalin\u2019s psychopathic actions having accounted for upwards of 20 million of the above number. Of course, 82 percent of millennials at least knew who Stalin was. This cannot be said regarding Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung; 42 percent of millennials were unfamiliar with this mass murderer of approximately 60 million. Forty percent didn\u2019t know who Argentine Marxist and major Cuban Revolution figure Che Guevara was. With respect to Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, the \u201cunacquainted with\u201d figures were, respectively, 33 and 32 percent. \\nNot surprisingly, this ignorance goes beyond history. While it\u2019s troubling that almost half of those aged 16 to 20 would support a socialist, there\u2019s good and bad news here. And they\u2019re the same thing: \\nThese young people generally don\u2019t know what socialism is. \\nAs I wrote in February, \u201cPeople 18 to 29 just helped vault Senator Bernie Sanders to a resounding New Hampshire primary victory, not at all deterred by his socialist label. But while they view that positively, they don\u2019t believe in socialist (in Sanders\u2019) wealth redistribution. In fact, this research shows that they cotton to it little more than do average Americans and no more than their age group did 20 years ago. In other words, millennials may like the word socialism, but, as with so many others, they don\u2019t understand well what it signifies or the nature of those for whom they vote.\u201d \\nIn reality, the label \u201csocialism\u201d is applied loosely today, yet it has a firm definition. Note that socialism was popularized via Karl Marx\u2019s and Friedrich Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto . And under Marxist doctrine, \u201csocialism\u201d \u2014 or the socialist revolution \u2014 is the transitional phase that extinguishes economic freedom and ushers in communism. Moreover, there are no communist governments because \u201ccommunism\u201d is the culmination of socialism, the stage where, the fanciful theory goes, the government has melted away and everyone lives happily and harmoniously in a state of economic equality-induced bliss. \\nThis is why the Iron Curtain-disgorging evil empire could, with a straight collective face, call itself the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. And it\u2019s why we should see a red flag (pun intended) when a politician such as Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist. Maybe he\u2019s more wizened than wise and doesn\u2019t really know what the word means \u2014 or, perhaps, he knows full well \u2014 and is capitalizing on the fact that others don\u2019t. \\nWhatever the case, it would be a mistake to view socialist seduction as solely a \u201cmillennial\u201d problem, as this only sparks intergenerational squabbling. For there are old fools and young fools and much foolishness in-between. Yet while we recognize that people are largely products of their upbringing, we nonetheless will analyze a given generation as if it\u2019s a breed apart as opposed to what it almost always is: the next iteration in a pattern. \\nConsider how 80 percent of Boomers consider communism a problem. While a high number, it\u2019s still a statistically significant drop from their elders\u2019 91 percent figure. And this is just part of a pattern, with the percentage of each age group that views \u201csocialism\u201d positively being as follows: age 65+, 13 percent; 50-64, 25 percent; 30-49, 34 percent; 18-29, 49 percent ( Pew Research Center , Dec. 28, 2011). Evident here isn\u2019t an overnight sea-change, but steadily increasing ignorance. \\nTragically, this is a worldwide phenomenon. Marxism has to an extent taken hold in Japan , Spain , and elsewhere, and Karl Marx is more popular than he has been in decades. As I wrote in 2013, \u201cSales of The Communist Manifesto (the best-selling book in history next to the Bible) and Das Kapital have soared since the 2008 financial crisis. Karl Marx was voted \u2018favorite philosopher\u2019 by BBC radio listeners, beating out contenders such as Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and Thomas Aquinas. And in an irony akin to having Marx\u2019s picture on a Bible tract, his image is the one most often chosen by customers of Germany\u2019s Sparkasse Chemnitz Bank \u2014 for their credit cards.\u201d \\nGiven the above, it\u2019s not surprising that what inspired mockery of late Senator Joe McCarthy has become reality: Marxist types abound in our government. New York City elected \u201cBolshevik\u201d Bill de Blasio, who raised money for the Sandinistas, subscribed to their newsletter, and honeymooned in Cuba. John Drew, a former Barack Obama acquaintance and reformed Marxist with whom I\u2019ve spoken personally, revealed that when he knew Obama, Obama was an \u201cardent Marxist-Leninist\u201d who \u201cwas in 100 percent, total agreement with [his] Marxist professors\u201d; this is no surprise because Obama\u2019s mentor, Frank Marshall Davis, was a card-carrying member of the Communist Party USA. \\nThen there are Obama\u2019s appointees, such as former \u201cGreen Jobs Czar\u201d and self-proclaimed communist Van Jones; former communications director Anita Dunn, who said that Mao Tse-tung was one of her \u201ctwo favorite philosophers\u201d; \u201cManufacturing Czar\u201d Ron Bloom, who said in a speech, \u201cWe agree with Mao\u201d; and \u201cGlobal Warming Czar\u201d Carol Browner, who was until recently listed as a leader of the socialist organization \u201cCommission for a Sustainable World Society.\u201d \\nAnd, finally, there\u2019s the woman who wants to succeed Obama, Hillary Clinton. Former Clinton operative Larry Nichols tells us that when he first met her, in the 1970s, she was wearing a medal around her neck stating, \u201cProud member of the American Communist Party\u201d (video here ; forward to 6:07). No wonder the Communist Party USA is \u201call in\u201d for Hillary . \\nIt\u2019s also no wonder that Clinton is beating Donald Trump by 28 points among under-30 voters. But tolerance for socialism/communism is intolerable. If we learned that almost half of young Americans would vote for a fascist and 21 percent would go so far as to back a Nazi, we\u2019d rightly be aghast. Instead, they\u2019re warming to the ideological descendants of even more prolific killers. Hey, what\u2019s 100 million victims between comrades?  '"}, "time": 1742561748.4651146}
