I guess that\u2019s the best way to put it,\u201d Luntz said. He explained, \u201cWhat he has said about Hillary Clinton and her campaign and drawing that contrast. What he has done to Israel and to Benjamin Netanyahu. That there are people that he has had political difficulties with \u2014  and by the way, Republican members of the house and senate \u2014  the people who he\u2019s disagreed with over the last eight years. He\u2019s gone to great pains to draw a contrast between the things that he says and the things that they have done that makes me think he\u2019s trying to settle scores before he leaves, and that\u2019s not presidential. \u201d Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo'"}, "time": 1742562182.2202413}
