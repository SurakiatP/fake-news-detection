Women\u2019s National soccer team added a rule requiring all players to stand for the playing of the national anthem. But, one of the players whose actions forced the rule by refusing to stand, Megan Rapinoe, is insisting that she won\u2019t stop speaking out about social issues no matter what rules the team implements. [Rapinoe, 31, took flack last season for joining former San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick in his   protests by taking a knee instead of standing during the anthem. But, after several players indulged the protests, the national team added rules requiring all players representing the U. S. to stand during the anthem.  The player, who has been on national teams since 2003, says she will obey the new rule but it won\u2019t stop her from speaking about about the \u201cinequality\u201d she claims to see in the U. S. A. \u201cWhat has surprised me the most, especially   is that people are still sort of arguing against it. It\u2019s really obvious that we have very serious inequality in this country across many different spectrums,\u201d Rapinoe told the U. K. Guardian. \u201cYes, we can talk about the form of protest, or the way it\u2019s done, or this or that. But it\u2019s still not really the conversation that I think we desperately need to have more of in this country. \u201d Rapinoe insisted that the anthem protest is not the only way to speak out against the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any perfect way to protest. I think if there was something else being done, something else would have been said about it,\u201d Rapinoe exclaimed. \u201cI can\u2019t look back and say that I would have done this different, this different or this different. \u201d But the player also said that she was not sorry for her protests. \u201cI can sleep at night knowing that I genuinely tried to have a really important conversation, or at least tried to open it up,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I came to it with an open mind, an open heart and tried to get as many people to talk about it as I could. \u201d \u201cGod forbid you be a gay woman and a person of color in this country because you\u2019d be really fu**ed,\u201d she added. Rapinoe also said she is widening her protests after \u201clearning\u201d more about the \u201cinequalities\u201d in the U. S. \u201cAs I got more into gay rights, I got more into equal pay and you just see that it\u2019s all connected. You can\u2019t really speak out on one thing and not another without it not being the full picture,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWe need to talk about a larger conversation in this country about equality in general and respect  \u2014   especially with the recent election and subsequent narrative that\u2019s coming from the White House right now. \u201d \u201cI hope to continue to have the conversation,\u201d Rapinoe concluded. \u201cHopefully people who disagree with me continue to have the conversation and we can kind of open each other up even more than we already have. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742564189.018546}
