Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose role in the Bridgegate scandal led to his firing and denied him the central role he was expected to play in the governor\u2019s presidential run. Mr. Stepien is expected to step in to help guide the campaign\u2019s political operations, according to two people close to Mr. Stepien and three people close to the Trump campaign who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Mr. Stepien was hired on Thursday, and one person who confirmed the hire said his title was expected to be national field director. A campaign spokesman did not respond to an email seeking comment. But the people who confirmed the hire said that Mr. Trump\u2019s    Jared Kushner, who is heavily involved in spending and strategy decisions in the campaign, discussed it in staff briefings and pushed for it to occur. Mr. Christie is the chief of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition committee, but he is no longer close to Mr. Stepien and was said to have been uninvolved in the discussions to hire him. Mr. Stepien is expected to help beef up a political operation that has been a work in progress for several weeks. He had initially been contacted by the Trump campaign earlier this year as Mr. Christie\u2019s campaign for president was sputtering. When the issue was revisited after Mr. Christie dropped out of the race, both the governor and Mr. Trump\u2019s   manager, Corey Lewandowski, opposed hiring him, according to people briefed at the time. Roger Stone, an informal adviser to Mr. Trump over many years, described the move as a positive one. \u2018He\u2019s a real professional and has the kind of contacts and experience the campaign could really use,\u201d Mr. Stone said. For Mr. Stepien, 38, it is a chance to resurrect what was once a promising career as a national political operative. He successfully ran both of Mr. Christie\u2019s campaigns for governor. Mr. Christie had hired him as a consultant to the Republican Governor\u2019s Association during his year as chairman of that group. In January 2014, Mr. Christie picked him to lead the New Jersey Republican party, calling Mr. Stepien \u201cthe best Republican operative in the country. \u201d It was widely expected that he would run Mr. Christie\u2019s presidential campaign. Days after the appointment, Mr. Christie cut Mr. Stepien loose, when documents from a legislative subpoena revealed that a deputy chief of staff to the governor, Bridget Anne Kelly, had sent an email calling for \u201csome traffic problems in Fort Lee,\u201d the town gridlocked by the lane closings on the George Washington Bridge between the borough and Manhattan in September 2013. Prosecutors, who indicted Ms. Kelly and two other Christie allies in the lane closings, have said the   were retaliation against the Fort Lee mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Mr. Christie for   in 2013. The governor gave little reason for why he dropped Mr. Stepien other than to say he had \u201clost confidence in Bill\u2019s judgment\u201d after other emails showed Mr. Stepien referring to the mayor of Fort Lee as \u201can idiot\u201d  \u2014   the kind of language Mr. Christie has been known to employ publicly. Mr. Stepien was not among the three people charged by federal prosecutors in the lane closings. But earlier this month, a lawyer for one of other defendants released texts from a conversation between two Christie staffers during the   news conference in which the governor denied knowing about the lane closings. \u201cHe just flat out lied about senior staff and Stepien not being involved,\u201d one staffer wrote to the other. Mr. Stepien\u2019s lawyer has insisted that his client was not involved in the scandal, and that the text does nothing to prove his involvement. Mr. Stepien had earlier refused to turn over documents or otherwise cooperate with a legislative committee investigating the lane closing scandals, asserting his Fifth Amendment rights against  . Mr. Stepien\u2019s career had all but hit a wall after Mr. Christie let him go. He did some work for a Republican direct mail firm and for New Jersey legislative campaigns and had discussions about working on the presidential campaign of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as well as on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in New Hampshire  \u2014   all before Mr. Christie dropped out of the race. In April, the governor\u2019s lieutenant, Kim Guadagno, named Mr. Stepien as executive director of a nonprofit set up to support her expected campaign for governor, a move Mr. Christie had opposed. The Trump campaign recently underwent a major   with the ascension of both the veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway, an adviser whom Mr. Trump has known for many years and one he trusts, and of Stephen K. Bannon, the financial force behind the Breitbart News website. Since then, there has been an effort to hire another political hand, with David Bossie, the head of the conservative group, Citizens United, briefly discussed as possibility, but national Republicans expressed reservations over his lack of experience directing campaign political operations.'"}, "time": 1742561938.9399996}
