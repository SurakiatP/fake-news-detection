He said anti-Russian sentiment in America has reached boiling point and was at its worst level since the Cold War. Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on his victory, expressing hope that the two countries will continue collaborative work on international issues\\n\u201cWe heard [Trump\u2019s] campaign rhetoric while still a candidate for the US presidency, which was focused on restoring the relations between Russia and the United States,\u201d President Putin said, speaking at the presentation ceremony of foreign ambassadors\u2019 letters of credentials in Moscow.\\n\u201cWe understand and are aware that it will be a difficult path in the light of the degradation in which, unfortunately, the relationship between Russia and the US are at the moment,\u201d he added. Speaking about the degraded state of relations between the countries, the president once again stressed that \u201cit is not our fault that Russia-US relations are as you see them.\u201d\\nEarlier today, in a message to Donald Trump the Russian President expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other\u2019s views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US.\\nThe Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some \u201cburning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,\u201d RIA Novosti reported.\\nOn top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that \u201cbuilding a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other\u2019s positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.\u201d\\nRussian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin has also expressed hope that Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election will help pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington.\\n\u201cThe current US-Russian relations cannot be called friendly. Hopefully, with the new US president a more constructive dialogue will be possible between our countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russian Parliament will welcome and support any steps in this direction,\u201d Volodin added on Wednesday.\\nA member of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, Senator Aleksey Pushkov, has meanwhile noted that Hillary Clinton\u2019s stake on the conflict with Russia has eventually done her a terrible disservice.\\n\u201c[Playing the] \u2018Russian card\u2019 and portraying Putin as a bad guy did not help Clinton. On the contrary, staking on the conflict with Moscow has only caused fear, doing her a disservice,\u201d he tweeted.\\nAccording to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia\u2019s relations with the US \u201cwas not our choice,\u201d however. For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia\u2019s interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month.\\nThe US will have to negotiate with Russia on finding solutions to international issues as no state is now able to act alone, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week, adding that problems in bilateral relations began to mount long before the Ukrainian crisis broke out in 2014.\\n'"}, "time": 1742564464.7245107}
