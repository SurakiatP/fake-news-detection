The Red Cavalry (the title of Babel\u2019s collection of short stories written when the Jew and former Menshevik was imbedded with pro-revolution Cossacks) had been confiscating peasant horses during the Civil War and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones. \\nFor the backward peasants, this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. In about a decade, being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt. For the time being, however, they were inclined to tolerate the Communists who at least had come to power on the promise of peace, bread and land. It was the assault on the gentry\u2019s land that for the time being assuaged the peasants. \\nResponding to an aggrieved muzhik (peasant), Dyakov, the eponymous Reserve Cavalry Commander who was a former circus rider described by Babel as \u201cred-faced with a gray mustache, a black cape, and wide red Tatar trousers with silver stripes\u201d, promised that he could make this \u201clively little mare spring to her feet again\u201d. The idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as \u201clively\u201d was almost an insult. The muzhik cried out, \u201cLord in Heaven and Mother of God. How is this poor thing supposed to get up? It\u2019s on its last legs!\u201d: \\nDyakov\u2019s ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred. Most of Babel\u2019s short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent. He wrote: \\n\u201cYou are insulting this horse, my dear fellow!\u201d Dyakov answered with fierce conviction. \u201cPure blasphemy, my dear fellow!\u201d And he deftly swung his athlete\u2019s body out of his saddle. Splendid and deft as if in the circus ring, he stretched his magnificent legs, his trousers girded by cords around the knees, and walked up to the dying animal. She peered at him dolefully with a severe, penetrating eye, licked some invisible command from his crimson palm, and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this sprightly, gray, blossoming Romeo. Her muzzle lolling, her legs skidding under her, feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious impatience, the mare slowly and deliberate1y rose onto her legs. And then we all saw Dyakov\u2019s slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty mane, and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks. Her whole body shivering, the mare stood on four legs without moving her timid, doglike, lovestruck eyes from Dyakov. \\n\u201cSo you see-this is a horse,\u201d Dyakov said to the muzhik , and added softly, \u201cand you were complaining, my dearest of friends!\u201d \\nThrowing his reins to his orderly, the commander of the Reserve Cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap and, swirling off his operatic cloak, disappeared into the headquarters. \\nToday, reading this story once again for the first time in fifty-four years, I am reminded of how important Babel was to me at the time. Like Ezra Pound, James Joyce and Thomas Mann, he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early 60s. I never thought once about who Babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict. All that mattered to me was Babel\u2019s prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a Cossack resurrecting a dying horse. \\nMy early connections to modernism and my later connections to Marxism that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage I carried around with me from the early 60s converged as I watched a press screening of \u201cFinding Babel\u201d that opens on October 28 th at the Cinema Village in New York. Directed by David Novack, who has a background as a sound engineer, it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of Babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the Soviet legacy. Given the prominence of Ukraine today as a possible trigger of WWIII according to some, Babel\u2019s multiple identity as Jew, Ukrainian, Communist and critic of Soviet deficiencies is worth pondering. \\nThe film is structured around the odyssey conducted by Andrei Malaev-Babel, who is the grandson of Isaac Babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the New College of Florida, to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work. Isaac Babel was executed for treason in 1940, having been charged with belonging to a Trotskyist group and spying for France and Austria. Babel\u2019s wife Antonina Pirozhkova, who died at the age of 101 in 2010, is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about Babel\u2019s personality and his travails as a dissident. After her husband\u2019s arrest in 1939, the Soviet cops told her to forget about him and to \u201cregulate her life\u201d according to the New York Times obituary. She was formidable in her own right. With her engineering degree, she helped to design the Moscow subway system. The obit notes: \\nMs. Pirozhkova recalled Babel\u2019s dismay at her haphazard reading habits, which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the \u201chundred books that every educated person needs to read.\u201d It included a volume titled \u201cThe Instincts and Morals of Insects.\u201d She recounted evenings spent with Soviet cultural giants like the film director Sergei M. Eisenstein and visits by foreign luminaries like Andr\u00e9 Gide and Andr\u00e9 Malraux. \\nIt was Babel\u2019s mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original Russian revolution rather than to fall in line as a Stalin toady. \\nAs he travels around Ukraine, Malaev-Babel encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere Babel as one of their own especially for \u201cOdessa Tales\u201d, another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as \u201cRed Cavalry\u201d. Written in 1923 and 1924, the stories focus on Jewish gangsters living in Moldavanka, an Odessa slum, hardly the material you\u2019d expect to find written by a partisan of the Russian Revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of Soviet culture that conformed to Terence\u2019s observation: \u201c Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto \u201c, or \u201cI am human, and nothing of that which is human is alien to me.\u201d \\nAlthough I have never read \u201cOdessa Tales\u201d, I plan to as soon as I find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather Louis Proyect probably knew in Byelorussia and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the USA. Unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in Sullivan County in upstate NY, Abe \u201cKid Twist\u201d Reles and other members of Murder Incorporated only saw the Borscht Belt as a place where they could dump their victims in Swan Lake, about fifteen minutes from my home town. \\nThroughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by Liev Schreiber that will be a good introduction to Babel\u2019s literary power. There are also interviews with some leading Babel scholars including Stanford professor Gregory Freidin who spent a day traveling around Paris with Malaev-Babel to see places where Babel lived for a few years before returning to Russia. We learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of Stalin\u2019s countless victims by living in exile, he was too attached to Russian culture and language to live abroad. \\nWhile in Paris, Babel wrote a play titled \u201cMaria\u201d that likely put him on Stalin\u2019s shit-list although being a free-thinking intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start. With his theater background, Malaev-Babel is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including Marina Vlady, an acclaimed Russian-French actress, who reads a letter from the titular character. \\nIn 2003, Gregory Freidin mounted a production of \u201cMaria\u201d at Stanford University. The play\u2019s program describes major character Isaac Dymshit, a Jewish gangster, as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous Maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution. She, like the young Babel, served in the Red Cavalry. \\nNever seen on stage, we only hear from Maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five. It begins: \\nAt dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me. By eight I have to be in the Political Propaganda Division, I\u2019m in charge there\u2013I edit the articles of the divisional newspaper, I run the literacy classes. Our reinforcements are all Ukrainians. They remind me of Italians, the way they talk and act. Russia has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries. In our house in Petersburg, opposite the Hermitage and the Winter Palace, we might as well have been living in Polynesia for we knew any\\xad thing at all about our people! \\nIt is writing lines like this that got Babel killed rather than spying for France or Austria. \\nBabel was a friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Maxim Gorky, who remained a diehard Stalinist despite sharing Babel\u2019s inclination for writing about the lower depths of Russian society. He was deeply troubled by how \u201cMaria\u201d depicted political corruption, prosecution of the innocent, and black marketeering within Soviet society. Gorky accused Babel of having a \u201cBaudelairean predilection for rotting meat.\u201d Apparently Gorky had forgotten that Baudelaire was Marx\u2019s favorite novelist. \\nDavid Novack, the director of \u201cFinding Babel\u201d has a connection to Odessa but not to its legendary Jewish gangsters. He has an ancestor named David Nowakowsky who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there. \\nIn an interview given to The Odessa Review , Novack sums up Isaac Babel\u2019s relationship to the Soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left. As someone with roots in the existential \u201coutsider\u201d world of the 1960s that saw Albert Camus as its most eloquent spokesmen, I never found myself comfortable with the Trotskyist milieu that fostered cultish obedience to the Genius Leader. To this day, it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland. I think that Novack\u2019s description of Babel\u2019s \u201cinsider/outsider\u201d sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the left: \\nBabel represented the insider outsider, that\u2019s what he was. He got himself all the way inside, up to the upper levels of the NKVD. Up to Beria who ended up supervising his torture in the end, personally. I don\u2019t know if he was in the room, but he had an office in the St. Catharine\u2019s Monastery where Babel was tortured. That monastery was being used as a torture prison, the Sukhanovo prison, which we note in the film, we visited it. He got himself as close to the flame as possible as an insider, but yet he was an outsider because he was from Odessa, he was Jewish. He should not even have been permitted to study under Gorky which is where he really honed his skills. The only reason that he was able to study under Gorky is that he smuggled himself illegally to St. Petersburg when he wasn\u2019t allowed to be there, because it was outside the settlement area for Jews. So Babel was an outsider. He then found himself with Red Calvary with the Cossacks in the Red Army, running through Western Ukraine as he documented brutality against the Ukrainians and the Jews. Brutality brought on by both sides, it was a civil war essentially between the reds and the Poles. Who suffered the most? The Jews and the Ukrainians, the peasantry are the ones who suffered the most in that conflict. There he was again, the outsider insider. It\u2019s from this very unique perspective where all his writing came from.'"}, "time": 1742563264.1760514}
