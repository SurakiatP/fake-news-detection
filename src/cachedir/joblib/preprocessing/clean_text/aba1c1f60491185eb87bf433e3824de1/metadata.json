The gap was by design: Ms. Zellweger, 47, an Oscar nominee for the first \u201cBridget\u201d movie and a winner in 2004 for \u201cCold Mountain,\u201d stepped away from the Hollywood \u201ccycle,\u201d as she called it, to take stock of her life. \u201cI had a lot of promises that I made to myself, years ago, about things that I wanted to learn and try,\u201d she said. She traveled, studied screenwriting  \u2014   \u201cI feel like I\u2019m more articulate with my pen\u201d  \u2014   and helped created a TV pilot about female musicians in 1960s and \u201970s Los Angeles. No networks have bitten so far, she said, miming a tear. Still, it seems to have   her to perform. She returns in the third Bridget installment, \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Baby,\u201d out Friday, Sept. 16, with a script written by Helen Fielding, the novelist who created the character, along with the \u201cBorat\u201d   Dan Mazer, and Emma Thompson, who also stars. \u201cIt was time\u201d to return, Ms. Zellweger said in an interview in Santa Monica, Calif. near her home. And doing another Bridget \u201cwas a  . I was just so happy to be back in her world. \u201d But sightings of Ms. Zellweger over the last few years also stirred up intense scrutiny of her appearance, including stunned reactions to her seemingly changed look on a red carpet in 2014. A slew of think pieces, about the undue pressure on women\u2019s beauty standards in Hollywood and beyond, and some less charitable commentary, followed. Ms. Zellweger eventually responded, in an August essay for The Huffington Post. \u201cNot that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut I did not make a decision to alter my face and have surgery on my eyes. \u201d And she insisted that she did not follow the brouhaha over her looks, until she had to. She has no public presence on social media. \u201cI don\u2019t participate in it, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s being said about me or other people until someone makes me aware of it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd usually it\u2019s an email, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry about  \u2014   \u2014  \u2019\u201d In person, Ms. Zellweger was   and thoughtful, if reticent about discussing some of the latest turns in her career. But she remains dedicated to the work: She watched hours of birthing videos to prepare to play a pregnant Bridget. The character is now a television news producer, so Ms. Zellweger also trailed a British   producer for research. That made her realize \u201chow important it is that the actor is not verbose,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI promised myself I would be very concise and quick with my answers from now on. \u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Did stepping into Bridget\u2019s shoes again feel familiar, or like a challenge because so much time has passed? Both. Familiar because the process is similar, and I feel like I know her pretty well, and a different kind of challenge because I\u2019ve never had to show the ways in which a person evolves in her life and the ways in which she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s my favorite stuff, by the way  \u2014   that she just can\u2019t help herself sometimes. She puts her foot in it, right? I love that she hasn\u2019t refined her social graces I love that she still goes for it  \u2014   even if she\u2019s uncertain what the outcome might be. I love that she\u2019s hopelessly romantic and optimistic. There were interesting conversations with Sharon Maguire, the director, about how [Bridget] might have gotten her life together  \u2014   she\u2019s a little bit more mature, she\u2019s progressed professionally, moved into property ownership in London and has achieved her ideal weight. And still her life is a relative mess. I like the message in that: that we can tick off the boxes, and yet we still don\u2019t quite have it together. And that\u2019s pretty much the truth of growing up, isn\u2019t it? You had that experience a bit. When did you realize that you wanted out of the Hollywood circuit? I don\u2019t think anybody is born with the faculties to know how to navigate what comes with it. One of the things that I learned is that I didn\u2019t know how to establish a healthy balance. I felt an obligation to say yes, whenever I was asked to do something on behalf of my work. And the years go by, and your family and friends understand that you have responsibilities, but they\u2019re going to have the barbecue anyway, and the wedding anyway, and the baby\u2019s having a birthday anyway. I just missed out on a lot of things. I needed to stop so I could reassess and figure out how to allow for myself in my own life. I needed to grow as a person in ways that didn\u2019t revolve around my work. Were you nervous making that leap, taking a break? I think not doing it was more frightening. One thing that changed in your time away is that there is now a bigger platform for both criticism and support, via social media. A male critic for Variety wrote a review of the trailer for \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Baby,\u201d in which he talked about your looks in a way that many people felt was sexist, and they didn\u2019t hesitate to call him out for it. Did that response feel helpful or empowering? I\u2019m grateful for that experience and that he chose to do what he did, because it brought me to a place where it was necessary that I stand up for myself. Which is not me. It\u2019s not in my nature to publicly explain myself. And it was probably time. Were you surprised at the level of scrutiny your appearance received in the last few years? Was that a consideration in coming back? It\u2019s always part of the equation  \u2014   that\u2019s been going on since 2000 [when she was cast as Bridget, a role for which she famously gained weight]. Too fat, and then I was too skinny and then   \u2026     But I\u2019m not alone in it it\u2019s just part of the reality of this experience now. I\u2019m not going to make my [career] decisions based on whether or not I\u2019m going to have to tolerate that. Did you find, as many actresses do, that as you got older, the roles got more  ? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s specific to aging. There\u2019s always been \u201cthe girlfriend,\u201d \u201cthe indiscretion\u201d  \u2014   that\u2019s always been in the mix. Is it something that I saw in the industry before I turned 40? Yeah. It\u2019s rare to read a great story that a woman my age would find relatable anyway. But now it seems that there\u2019s something else going on as well. There\u2019s really an unprecedented reset happening in our business  \u2014   a little bit of an identity crisis. Another thing that\u2019s changed is a focus on pay equity in the business. Is that something that crossed your radar when working on any of the other Bridgets, versus now, getting paid as much as your male  ? I don\u2019t think it occurred to me that that would be an issue  \u2014   isn\u2019t that sad? But in this instance, I don\u2019t think it was an issue. In your Huffington Post essay, you talked about \u201cdoing better. \u201d What did you mean by that? It\u2019s not about onscreen or famous people, it\u2019s more about the precedent that we set, and I don\u2019t speak about it from the perspective of an actress who has had certain experiences that aren\u2019t necessarily fun, but as an observer, as part of society. You read about bullying and how we can stop kids from this   bullying and the catastrophic effects that it has, but we set the example. How can we ask them to make better choices when they\u2019re just emulating what they see coming from us? Now that you\u2019re back on this circuit, are there parts of it you\u2019re going to treat differently, given your past experiences? It\u2019s much easier for me to say no, because I understand that there are no consequences for saying no. \u201cNo\u201d is an empowering word. I know that now.'"}, "time": 1742564495.2278278}
