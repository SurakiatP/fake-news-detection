Bannon was still heading Breitbart News, he went to the Vatican to cover the canonization of John Paul II and make some friends. High on his list of people to meet was an archconservative American cardinal, Raymond Burke, who had openly clashed with Pope Francis. In one of the cardinal\u2019s antechambers, amid religious statues and   walls, Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon  \u2014   who is now President Trump\u2019s   eminence  \u2014   bonded over their shared worldview. They saw Islam as threatening to overrun a prostrate West weakened by the erosion of traditional Christian values, and viewed themselves as unjustly ostracized by    political elites. \u201cWhen you recognize someone who has sacrificed in order to remain true to his principles and who is fighting the same kind of battles in the cultural arena, in a different section of the battlefield, I\u2019m not surprised there is a meeting of hearts,\u201d said Benjamin Harnwell, a confidant of Cardinal Burke who arranged the 2014 meeting. While Mr. Trump, a   president who has boasted of groping women, may seem an unlikely ally of traditionalists in the Vatican, many of them regard his election and the ascendance of Mr. Bannon as potentially   breakthroughs. Just as Mr. Bannon has connected with   parties threatening to topple governments throughout Western Europe, he has also made common cause with elements in the Roman Catholic Church who oppose the direction Francis is taking them. Many share Mr. Bannon\u2019s suspicion of Pope Francis as a dangerously misguided, and probably socialist, pontiff. Until now, Francis has marginalized or demoted the traditionalists, notably Cardinal Burke, carrying out an inclusive agenda on migration, climate change and poverty that has made the pope a figure of unmatched global popularity, especially among liberals. Yet in a newly turbulent world, Francis is suddenly a lonelier figure. Where once Francis had a powerful ally in the White House in Barack Obama, now there is Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon, this new president\u2019s ideological guru. For many of the pope\u2019s ideological opponents in and around the Vatican, who are fearful of a pontiff they consider outwardly avuncular but internally a ruthless wielder of absolute political power, this angry moment in history is an opportunity to derail what they see as a disastrous papal agenda. And in Mr. Trump, and more directly in Mr. Bannon, some   \u201cRad Trads\u201d  \u2014   or radical traditionalists  \u2014   see an alternate leader who will stand up for traditional Christian values and against Muslim interlopers. \u201cThere are huge areas where we and the pope do overlap, and as a loyal Catholic, I don\u2019t want to spend my life fighting against the pope on issues where I won\u2019t change his mind,\u201d Mr. Harnwell said over a lunch of cannelloni. \u201cFar more valuable for me would be spend time working constructively with Steve Bannon. \u201d He made it clear he was speaking for himself, not for the Institute for Human Dignity, a conservative Catholic group that he founded, and insisted that he shared the pope\u2019s goals of ensuring peace and ending poverty, just not his ideas on how to achieve it. Mr. Bannon publicly articulated his worldview in remarks a few months after his meeting with Cardinal Burke, at a Vatican conference organized by Mr. Harnwell\u2019s institute. Speaking via video feed from Los Angeles, Mr. Bannon, a Catholic, held forth against rampant secularization, the existential threat of Islam, and a capitalism that had drifted from the moral foundations of Christianity. That talk has garnered much attention, and approval by conservatives, for its explicit expression of Mr. Bannon\u2019s vision. Less widely known are his efforts to cultivate strategic alliances with those in Rome who share his interpretation of a   \u201cchurch militant\u201d theology. Mr. Bannon\u2019s visage, speeches and endorsement of Mr. Harnwell as \u201cthe smartest guy in Rome\u201d are featured heavily on the website of Mr. Harnwell\u2019s foundation. Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser has maintained email contact with Cardinal Burke, according to Mr. Harnwell, who dropped by the cardinal\u2019s residence after lunch. And another person with knowledge of Mr. Bannon\u2019s current outreach said the White House official is personally calling his contacts in Rome for thoughts on who should be the Trump administration\u2019s ambassador to the Holy See. During Mr. Bannon\u2019s April 2014 trip he courted Edward Pentin, a leading conservative Vatican reporter, as a potential correspondent in Rome for Breitbart, the website that is popular with the   a   movement that has attracted white supremacists. \u201cHe really seemed to get the battles the church needs to fight,\u201d said Mr. Pentin, the author of \u201cThe Rigging of a Vatican Synod?\u201d a book asserting that Pope Francis and his supporters railroaded opponents. Chief among those battles, Mr. Pentin said, was Mr. Bannon\u2019s focus on countering a \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d that had seeped into the church. Since that visit and the meeting with Cardinal Burke  \u2014   an experience that Daniel Fluette, the head of production for Breitbart, described as \u201cincredibly powerful\u201d for Mr. Bannon  \u2014   Mr. Trump\u2019s ideological strategist has maintained a focus on Rome. Mr. Bannon returned to direct the documentary \u201cTorchbearer,\u201d in which the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Phil Robertson contemplates the apocalyptic consequences of an eroding Christendom. Mr. Bannon also reunited with old friends, including Breitbart\u2019s eventual Rome correspondent, Thomas Williams. A former priest, Mr. Williams said that he used to have arguments with Mr. Bannon about whether the pope subscribed to a   brand of liberation theology, with Mr. Bannon calling the pope a \u201c . \u201d Mr. Williams said he usually defended the pope, but that recent statements by Francis convinced him \u201cSteve turned out to be right. That happens more often than not. \u201d Mr. Bannon\u2019s private thoughts about the pope have at times surfaced in public. On May 23, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Williams spoke about Pope Francis on the radio program Breitbart News Daily. Discussing a Breitbart article about the new mayor of London titled \u201cPope Hails Election of Sadiq Khan, Celebrates Mass Muslim Migration Into Europe,\u201d Mr. Bannon suggested that the pope \u201cseems almost to be putting the responsibility on the working men and women of Italy and Europe et cetera, that they have to go out of their way to accommodate\u201d migration. Was the pope a global elitist, Mr. Bannon asked, \u201ctwo or three steps removed from this?\u201d Many critics of Francis express similar views, but they are often scared to express it for fear of retribution from the pope, who, they say, has eyes and ears all over the Vatican. Instead, the pope\u2019s critics anonymously papered Rome over the weekend with posters of a   Francis above complaints about his removing and ignoring clerics and cardinals. \u201cWhere\u2019s your mercy?\u201d it asked. Conservatives and traditionalists in the Vatican secretly pass around phony   of the Vatican\u2019s official paper, L\u2019Osservatore Romano, making fun of the pope. Or they spread a YouTube video critiquing the pope and his exhortation on love in the family, \u201cAmoris Laetitia,\u201d which many traditionalists consider Francis\u2019 opening salvo against the doctrine of the church. Set to the music of \u201cThat\u2019s Amore,\u201d an aggrieved crooner sings, \u201cWhen will we all be freed from this cruel tyranny, that\u2019s Amoris\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s the climate of fear engineered for four years, that\u2019s Amoris. \u201d Cardinal Burke  \u2014   who has said that the pope\u2019s exhortation, which opened the door for divorced Catholics remarried outside the church to receive communion, might require \u201ca formal act of correction\u201d  \u2014   has been unusually outspoken in his criticism of Francis. Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon declined to comment for this article. Just weeks ago, the pope stripped Cardinal Burke of his remaining institutional influence after a scandal exploded at the Knights of Malta, a nearly    chivalrous order where he had been exiled as a liaison to the Vatican. The pope had removed the order\u2019s grand master after he showed disobedience to the pope. There was a sense in the order that the grand master followed the lead of Cardinal Burke because he projected authority, a power that stemmed in part from his support by the Trump administration, one influential knight said. Cardinal Burke has become a champion to conservatives in the United States. Under Mr. Bannon, Breitbart News urged its Rome correspondent to write sympathetically about him. And at a meeting before last month\u2019s   March for Life rally in Washington, Cardinal Burke received the Law of Life Achievement, or Nail award, a framed replica of the nail used to hold the feet of Christ to the cross. According to   Westen, the editor of Life Site News, who announced the award, the prize is awarded to Christians \u201cwho have received a stab in the back. \u201d Despite Mr. Bannon\u2019s inroads in Rome, Mr. Burke and other traditionalists are not ascendant in the Vatican. The Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest who edits the   journal La Civilta Cattolica and who is close to the pope, dismissed their criticism as the stuff of a noisy but small \u201cecho chamber. \u201d He also played down the effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent on the standing of Francis\u2019 opponents in the Vatican, saying it was only on a \u201clevel of image\u201d and \u201cpropaganda. \u201d The pope will maintain his direction and not be distracted by fights against those trying to undercut him, Father Spadaro said. \u201cHe moves forward, and he moves ahead very fast. \u201d He added that Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on immigrants from certain Muslim countries was \u201copposite\u201d to the pontiff\u2019s vision for how to foster unity and peace. The pope, Father Spadaro said, is doing everything he can to avoid the clash of civilizations that both fundamentalist Muslims and Christians want. Indeed, the pope does not seem to be slowing down. Days after the election of Mr. Trump, in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, the Vatican officially elevated new cardinals selected by Pope Francis who reflected the pope\u2019s emphasis on an inclusive church  \u2014   far from the worldview of Mr. Bannon and Mr. Burke. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he is just bringing new people in that think maybe like him,\u201d Cardinal Blase Cupich, the influential new cardinal of Chicago, said after the ceremony. \u201cHe is transforming the church in making us rethink how we have done things before. \u201d That transformation was evident later in the evening, when the old conservative guard came to pay their respects to the new cardinals. Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz, a powerful cardinal close to the pope, walked around in simple cleric clothes, the equivalent of civilian dress among all the flowing cassocks. Asked whether the ascent of Mr. Trump would embolden Mr. Bannon\u2019s allies in the Vatican to intensify their opposition and force the pope to take a more orthodox line, he shrugged. \u201cThe doctrine is secure,\u201d he said, adding that the mission of the church was more to safeguard the poor. It was also, he reminded his traditionalist colleagues, to serve St. Peter, whose authority is passed down through the popes. \u201cAnd today, Francis is Peter. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563359.7676654}
