The subject of conversation was the report released by United States intelligence chiefs on Friday informing   Donald J. Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered an extensive, but covert, cyberoperation to help Mr. Trump win the election. The Russians had hacked and leaked emails, unleashed \u201ctrolls\u201d on social media and used their \u201c  propaganda machine\u201d to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton. In Washington, the report was viewed as extraordinary, both for its timing, raising sharp questions about the  \u2019s legitimacy on the verge of his taking office, and for its assertions, describing the operation as Russia\u2019s boldest effort yet to meddle with American elections, to spread discontent and to \u201cundermine the U. S.  democratic order. \u201d But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana, a state the   won by 20 points, and in Indiana, a state he won by nearly the same margin, found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision. \u201cFrom the parts of the report I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as Tea Party favorite, \u201cit seems silly. \u201d There are genuine concerns about Russia\u2019s cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.) Of the comments he had seen from fellow Trump supporters on Facebook and in emails, he added, \u201c90 percent of them are like, \u2018What\u2019s the big deal? \u2019\u201d The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in American elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries\u2019 elections. Even if the Russians did do it  \u2014   which some were more willing to concede than others  \u2014   what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, \u201cjust being sore losers. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the Russians posed as big a problem to the Clintons as the Clintons posed to themselves,\u201d said Paul Emenes, 49, while he sold ribs, shoulders and chops at a frigid outdoor farmers\u2019 market in Covington. Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Mr. Emenes said. He added that, as long as Mr. Trump was not involved himself, \u201cit doesn\u2019t change the way I view him. \u201d Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, La. front yard after the previous night\u2019s frost, had a similar attitude. \u201cTrump is Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cDo I think he\u2019s going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don\u2019t. I think  \u2014   I hope  \u2014   his focus will be on making America great again. \u201d Ms. Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. \u201cWhy would Putin even want Trump?\u201d Mr. Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Mr. Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Obama might do before he leaves office. It was Mr. Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Mr. Putin get away with things, Mr. Yates continued. Mr. Trump would be much tougher. But Mr. Yates then added: \u201cWhy is everybody so afraid of Russia? I\u2019m not against Putin. \u201d This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was \u201ca basket case,\u201d and not the powerful foe it once was, said Mr. Marino, from his seat at McDonald\u2019s. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Ind. Ms. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as \u201csomewhere in the middle\u201d between friend and enemy, but agreed with Mr. Trump that the United States could work with them to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. \u201cWe may have to line up with people who may not be our \u2018friend\u2019 to make that happen,\u201d she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the Central Intelligence Agency. As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. \u201cThe idea of a fair election\u201d had been placed in doubt, Ms. Willis said. \u201cWe were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you\u2019re talking about espionage. \u201d The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Senator John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. \u201cOur president being in cahoots with the Russian government?\u201d Mr. Willis said. \u201cYes, I\u2019m very concerned about that. \u201d In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56,   Eagle 20 cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Mr. Gubert came to a different conclusion. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m glad they did it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563540.3019328}
