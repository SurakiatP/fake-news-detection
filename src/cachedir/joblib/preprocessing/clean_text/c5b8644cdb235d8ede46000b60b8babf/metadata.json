He was not oblivious to the dysfunction that has been a part of the organization for years. He expected some controversy or another with the Knicks. Roughly nine months into his tenure, the team has not fallen short of Hornacek\u2019s expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s lived up to the billing,\u201d he said Wednesday before the Knicks fell,   to the Los Angeles Clippers. \u201cIt\u2019s been something out here. \u201d But even Hornacek could not have expected that the game that night would dissolve into a   circus. While a feud continues to stew between the Knicks president Phil Jackson and the team\u2019s top star, Carmelo Anthony, amid   struggles, their game ceded the spotlight Wednesday night to a courtside fracas. Charles Oakley, the voluble but beloved former Knicks stalwart, was arrested after getting into an altercation with security guards midway through the first quarter. Oakley was removed from Madison Square Garden and handcuffed. Oakley was sitting courtside, in an aisle seat in the first row of the section near the Knicks\u2019 bench. Accounts of his behavior varied widely. According to some spectators seated nearby, he had been calm early in the game. He took a photograph with Felice Bergman, a fan with season tickets several rows higher. James L. Dolan, the Knicks\u2019 owner, with whom Oakley has a contentious relationship, sat nearby, but several spectators said they did not see Oakley exchange any words with Dolan or try to provoke him. But they did see Oakley exchanging glances with a security guard who was standing several feet away. Oakley seemed to utter something to the guard when he walked by, according to T. J. Veenstra, who was sitting behind Oakley. A guard soon came over to Oakley and asked him to leave. Oakley asked why. \u201cHe just couldn\u2019t understand why,\u201d said Matthew Barbara, who sat a few rows up from Oakley. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see him throw a punch or do anything. He wasn\u2019t nasty to any of the people behind him. We\u2019re trying to figure out what happened. \u201d Oakley was soon surrounded by a phalanx of guards, as John McEnroe, the former tennis champion, stood behind them on the court watching. As they tried to remove Oakley, he pushed one guard twice before being restrained and taken away. The game, which was still in its early stages, stopped as players from both teams watched the commotion. As he was being led out, the crowd chanted: \u201cOakley! Oakley!\u201d Knicks guard Derrick Rose later said: \u201cThat was the weirdest. I didn\u2019t know what was going on. \u201d The police said Oakley had been charged with three counts of   assault and one count of criminal trespass, all misdemeanors. He was released with an appearance ticket. The Knicks, in a statement, said Oakley had behaved in a \u201chighly inappropriate and completely abusive manner. \u201d But fans sitting nearby said they did not feel that was the case. \u201cNothing he did rose to the level of what happened,\u201d Jamie Vitiello said. \u201cThey overacted. \u201d The episode was a distraction from another Knicks quarrel. The previous day, Jackson had posted a message on Twitter that seemed to endorse a Bleacher Report story painting Anthony as a star who did not have a sufficient will to win and who was more interested in building his brand and his own statistics. It was another shot in a feud between Jackson and Anthony that has persisted all season. After the game, Anthony was asked if he still trusted Jackson. \u201cI did say that,\u201d Anthony said, adding: \u201cI trust the process. \u201d Anthony and Jackson have met twice to calm the waters. In December, Jackson said Anthony was a   on offense. In January, Charley Rosen, a longtime confidante of Jackson\u2019s, wrote a column on FanRag Sports that said Anthony had \u201coutlived his usefulness in New York. \u201d And for the last several weeks, Anthony has heard his name in trade rumors as the Knicks have reportedly tried to trade him, to teams including the Clippers. Anthony, however, has a   clause in his contract and has not indicated that he wants to leave the organization. Jackson, however, did try to play peacekeeper in the Knicks\u2019 other contentious situation on Wednesday. After Oakley was taken away from his seat, Jackson rushed out to the tunnel to try to calm him. But Oakley continued to fume as he stood outside the court with his hands in cuffs and guards surrounding him. \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d he said, mixing in expletives. He said Dolan was responsible  \u2014   although he did not say for what. Oakley has had a conflicted relationship with the Knicks. He was a fan favorite during his 10 seasons with the team. He was known for his rugged and physical style and helped take them to the 1994 N. B. A. Finals. Yet, he has been exiled over the last few years after a falling out with the organization. While many of his former teammates returned to Madison Square Garden, Oakley had not. \u201cThe boss don\u2019t like me,\u201d Oakley told The New York Times last fall. He said he has tried to meet with Dolan but has been rebuffed. \u201cI mean, I had at least 15 people try to set up a meeting,\u201d Oakley said. \u201cHe won\u2019t meet. I want to sit down to talk to him. I want me and him in a room. And lock the door. Lock that door!\u201d On Wednesday, however, they shared an arena  \u2014   one that had once been the setting for Oakley\u2019s glory days. When he was eclipsed by security guards, Doc Rivers, the Clippers coach and a former teammate, immediately recognized him at the center. \u201cThat was tough to watch,\u201d Rivers said.'"}, "time": 1742564503.0431318}
