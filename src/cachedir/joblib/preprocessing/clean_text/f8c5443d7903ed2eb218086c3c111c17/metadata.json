An Israeli official told AFP on condition of anonymity that ministers were responding to a Trump request to present him with \u201c  measures\u201d ahead of his talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas on Tuesday. In a statement, Trump\u2019s administration welcomed the moves, saying he \u201chas been encouraging both sides to take steps that improve the environment for peace making. \u201d \u201cHe has expressed particular interest in taking steps to improve the Palestinian economy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. \u201d In what the Israeli official described as a \u201cgesture for Trump\u2019s visit, which does not harm Israel\u2019s interests\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s security cabinet on Sunday approved the enlargement of a Palestinian industrial zone on the edge of the southern West Bank. He said that the possibility of extending Israel Railways services to the northern West Bank city of Jenin would also be examined. They also gave the nod to streamlining transit procedures at Shaar Ephraim, a busy crossing point in the northern part of the occupied West Bank for Palestinian labourers with permits to work in Israel. The official said that opening hours for passage across the main Jordan River bridge linking the Palestinian territory and the neighbouring kingdom were to be extended to  . There would also be reforms to Palestinian land use in urban areas in the 60 percent of the West Bank under full Israeli control. He did not elaborate but Israel\u2019s Haaretz daily said the intention was to allow construction of \u201cthousands of Palestinian homes\u201d in the area where for years it has been almost impossible for Palestinians to get Israeli permits to build on their own land. Haaretz said that at Sunday night\u2019s meeting Education Minister Naftali Bennett and justice minister Ayelet Shaked, of the   Jewish Home party, \u201cobjected vehemently\u201d to the building plans. In an apparent attempt to calm opposition from within Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government, seen as the most   in the country\u2019s history, the security cabinet also approved setting up a committee to work for retroactive legalisation of wildcat Israeli construction in the West Bank, the official said.'"}, "time": 1742561813.4120576}
