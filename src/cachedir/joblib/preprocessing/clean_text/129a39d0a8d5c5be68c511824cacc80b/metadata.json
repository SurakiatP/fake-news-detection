[Twenty months after Donald Trump sold the contest to   the pageant made every effort to separate itself from its former owner \u2014  a move not lost on the media covering the event. The Associated Press, for instance, reported: \u201cThe pageant included a field of five new immigrants who spoke on air about the importance of diversity  \u2014   as if to refute US President Donald Trump\u2019s less than welcoming stand toward some immigrants and refugees. \u201d  McCullough, an   born in Italy, looked the part but refused to play it this weekend. Miss D. C. rejected feminism for equality. \u201cSo as a woman scientist in the government, I\u2019d like to lately transpose the word \u2018feminism\u2019 to \u2018equalism,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to consider myself  \u2014   try not to consider myself like this   you know, like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t really care about men.\u2019 But one thing I\u2019m going to say, though, is women, we are just as equal as men when it comes to opportunity in the workplace. \u201d She further ran afoul of the politically correct when she described health care as an earned \u201cprivilege\u201d rather than an awarded \u201cright. \u201d She told her questioners, \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to say it\u2019s a privilege. As a government employee, I am granted health care. And I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs. \u201d She won the judges but lost the judgmental. Calling the   Miss USA\u2019s answers \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201cill informed,\u201d the appropriately named Linda Stasi of the New York Daily News charged that \u201cMcCullough did all women a disservice with her remarks on healthcare, but she did more damage with her dismissal of feminism. \u201d Other cultural commissars carped. It\u2019s incredibly sad that in 2017, a woman is striving to occupy a position of influence   no understanding of what feminism is. #MissUSA,  \u2014   courtney (@seecourttweet) May 15, 2017,  Dear #kara mccullough You are sadly mistaken. Everyone has a right to healthcare. Maybe you should be stripped of yours. The ACA helps many!  \u2014   Kizzy (@TrulyKizzo) May 15, 2017,  Happy to see a woman of color crowned Miss USA two years in a row, but Kara McCullough has some problematic views on healthcare and feminism,  \u2014   mama cass (@_femalien) May 15, 2017,  It\u2019s a beauty pageant. The job requirements don\u2019t call for a nuclear scientist. But it helps that Miss USA works a nuclear scientist.'"}, "time": 1742561701.1374254}
