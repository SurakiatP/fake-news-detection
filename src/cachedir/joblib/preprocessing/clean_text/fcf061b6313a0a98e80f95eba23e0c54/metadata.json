Flynn reached a conclusion that stunned some of his subordinates at the Defense Intelligence Agency: Iran had a role in the attack, he told them. Now, he added, it was their job to prove it  \u2014   and, by implication, to show that the White House was wrong about what had led to the attack. Mr. Flynn, whom   Donald J. Trump has chosen to be his national security adviser, soon took to pushing analysts to find Iran\u2019s hidden hand in the disaster, according to current and former officials familiar with the episode. But like many other investigations into Benghazi, theirs found no evidence of any links, and the general\u2019s stubborn insistence reminded some officials at the agency of how the Bush administration had once relentlessly sought to connect Saddam Hussein and Iraq to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Years before Mr. Flynn met Mr. Trump, his brief tenure running the Defense Intelligence Agency foreshadowed some of the same qualities he has exhibited more recently as he has plunged into politics and controversy as a key campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, who shared his desire to usurp what he viewed as Washington\u2019s incompetent and corrupt elite. Many of those who observed the general\u2019s time at the agency described him as someone who alienated both superiors and subordinates with his sharp temperament, his refusal to brook dissent, and what his critics considered a conspiratorial worldview. Those qualities could prove problematic for a national security adviser, especially one who will have to mediate the conflicting views of cabinet secretaries and agencies for a president with no experience in defense or foreign policy issues. Traditionally, the job has gone to a Washington veteran: Condoleezza Rice, for instance, or Thomas E. Donilon. The new job will give Mr. Flynn, 57, nearly unfettered access to the Oval Office. Whether it is renewed bloodletting in Ukraine, a North Korean nuclear test or a hurricane swamping Haiti, he will often have the last word with Mr. Trump about how the United States should react. For Mr. Flynn, serving as the president\u2019s chief adviser on defense and foreign policy matters, represents a triumphal return to government after being dismissed as agency director in 2014 after two years there. Heading the agency, the Pentagon\u2019s intelligence arm, was supposed to be the capstone of a storied career. Through tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Flynn had built a reputation as a brash and outspoken officer with an unusual talent for unraveling terrorist networks, and both his fiercest critics and his outspoken supporters praise his work from those wars. In numerous interviews and speeches over the past year, Mr. Flynn, who did not respond to requests for comment for this article, has maintained that he was forced out as director for refusing to toe the Obama administration\u2019s line that Al Qaeda was in retreat. The claim has made the general something of a cult figure among many Republicans. \u201cD. I. A. has always been a problem child and it remains that way,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cFlynn tried to get in there and fix things and he was only given two years until they ran him out because they didn\u2019t like his assessment. \u201d The congressman added: \u201cThey didn\u2019t have an excuse to fire him, so they made it up. Nobody has been able to fix that place. \u201d But others say he was forced out for a relatively simple reason: He failed to effectively manage a sprawling, largely civilian bureaucracy. At the agency, \u201cFlynn surrounded himself with loyalists. In implementing his vision, he moved at light speed, but he didn\u2019t communicate effectively,\u201d said Douglas H. Wise,  deputy director from 2014 until he retired in August. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tolerate it well when subordinates didn\u2019t move fast enough,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a senior military officer, he expected compliance and didn\u2019t want any pushback. \u201d Founded in 1961, the Defense Intelligence Agency has long been in the shadow of the Central Intelligence Agency, and with the end of the Cold War it lost its primary mission of collecting and analyzing information about the Soviet military. Strained by a decade of conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was performing an uncertain role within the constellation of American spy agencies when Mr. Flynn arrived at headquarters in  . The agency\u2019s system of human intelligence collection was perceived as largely broken. The effort to rebuild it was underway when Mr. Flynn took control in 2012, but he made it immediately known that he had a dim view of the agency\u2019s recent performance. During a tense gathering of senior officials at an   retreat, he gave the assembled group a taste of his leadership philosophy, according to one person who attended the meeting and insisted on anonymity to discuss classified matters. Mr. Flynn said that the first thing everyone needed to know was that he was always right. His staff would know they were right, he said, when their views melded to his. The room fell silent, as employees processed the lecture from their new boss. Current and former employees said Mr. Flynn had trouble adjusting his style for an organization with a   work force that was 80 percent civilian. He was used to a strict military chain of command, and was at times uncomfortable with the      that is common among intelligence analysts. Some also described him as a Captain   character, paranoid that his staff members were undercutting him and credulous of conspiracy theories. At times, the general also exhibited what a number of officials described as   on the larger strategic challenges confronting the nation. The most glaring example came in early March 2014, just after Russia had seized Crimea. American officials were weighing whether to impose sanctions in response, but Mr. Flynn was pushing ahead with plans to travel to Moscow to build on an existing   initiative with his Russian counterparts. He also wanted to invite Russian military intelligence officials to Washington to discuss the threat of Islamist militants. His superiors ordered both canceled. By the end of his tenure, he had largely cut out senior staff members from significant   relying instead on a small circle of trusted advisers he had come to know during his overseas military deployments. His bosses  \u2014   Michael G. Vickers, the under secretary of defense for intelligence, and James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence  \u2014   came to think that the agency was adrift, and that Mr. Flynn refused to address its biggest problems. \u201cRegrettably, he got engaged in an increasingly bitter and organizationally paralyzing feud with his senior staff when he should have been focused on building the intelligence capabilities\u201d of the agency, said Mr. Vickers, who was Mr. Flynn\u2019s immediate boss at the Pentagon. During his tour in Iraq, he served under Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, running intelligence for the military\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command, whose relentless campaign of raids and airstrikes hollowed out Al Qaeda in Iraq. When General McChrystal went to run the war in Afghanistan in 2009, Mr. Flynn signed on as his intelligence chief. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a staid intelligence officer. He was aggressive. He was about the mission,\u201d said Richard M. Frankel, a former senior F. B. I. official who worked with Mr. Flynn at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \u201cHe can have sharp elbows because he is about the mission. \u201d He burnished his reputation as an intelligence officer  \u2014   but also for controversy. He   a paper, \u201cFixing Intel,\u201d that offered an early hint of his disdain for the civilian intelligence analysts he would later clash with at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Published by a Washington think tank, it bluntly stated that \u201cthe U. S. intelligence community is only marginally relevant to the overall strategy,\u201d infuriating officials at the D. I. A. and the C. I. A. More problematic from the military\u2019s perspective was Mr. Flynn\u2019s willingness to share intelligence with other countries. He returned to Washington at the end of 2010, and found himself under investigation for sharing sensitive data with Pakistan about the Haqqani network, arguably the most capable faction of the Taliban, and for providing highly classified intelligence to British and Australian forces fighting in Afghanistan. His superiors eventually concluded that he was trying to prod Pakistan to crack down on the Haqqanis (they have yet to do so) and the general remains unapologetic about sharing intelligence with British and Australian forces. \u201cThey\u2019re our closest allies! I mean, really, we\u2019re fighting together and I can\u2019t share a single piece of paper?\u201d he said in an interview last year. Around the same time, he was also getting to know Michael A. Ledeen, a controversial writer and former Reagan administration official. The two men connected immediately, sharing a similar worldview and a belief that America was in a world war against Islamist militants allied with Russia, Cuba and North Korea. That worldview is what Mr. Flynn came to be best known for during the presidential campaign, when he argued that the United States faced a singular, overarching threat, and that there was just one accurate way to describe it: \u201cradical Islamic terrorism. \u201d He has posted on Twitter that fear of Muslims is rational, written that Islamic law is spreading in the United States, and said that Islam itself is more like a political ideology than a religion. The United States, he wrote in \u201cField of Fight,\u201d a book about radical Islam he   with Mr. Ledeen, is \u201cin a world war, but very few people recognize it. \u201d Mr. Flynn saw the Benghazi attack in September 2012 as just one skirmish in this global war. But it was his initial reaction to the event, immediately seeking evidence of an Iranian role, that many saw as emblematic of a conspiratorial bent. Iran, a Shiite nation, has generally eschewed any alliance with Sunni militants like the ones who attacked the American diplomatic compound. For weeks, he pushed analysts for evidence that the attack might have had a state sponsor  \u2014   sometimes shouting at them when they didn\u2019t come to the conclusions he wanted. The attack, he told his analysts, was a \u201cblack swan\u201d event that required more creative intelligence analysis to decipher. \u201cTo ask employees to look for the . 0001 percent chance of something when you have an actual emergency and dead Americans is beyond the pale,\u201d said Joshua Manning, an agency analyst from 2009 to 2013. Beyond Benghazi, American officials said that in time, the general grew angrier at what he saw as the Obama administration\u2019s passivity in dealing with worldwide threats  \u2014   from Sunni extremist terrorism to Iran. He also saw the C. I. A. an organization he had long disdained, as overly political and too willing to advance the White House\u2019s agenda. In particular, he became convinced that the C. I. A. was refusing to declassify many of the documents found at Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, because they seemed to undercut the administration\u2019s narrative about Qaeda strength at the time Bin Laden was killed. \u201cIf they put out what we knew, then the president could\u2019ve not said, in a national election, Al Qaeda\u2019s on the run and we\u2019ve killed Bin Laden,\u201d Mr. Flynn said before the latest election, referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012   bid. \u201cEven today, he talks about Bin Laden as though that was a stroke of genius. I mean, c\u2019mon!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563306.9291673}
