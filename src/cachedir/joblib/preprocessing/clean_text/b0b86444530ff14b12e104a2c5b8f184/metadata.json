When he punts during those final few moments before kickoff, Edwards has a different objective. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to kill cheerleaders,\u201d Edwards said. And not just cheerleaders. Marching bands. Honor guards. Drum lines.   civilians. The pageantry in the N. F. L. differs from week to week, stadium to stadium, but it always poses a challenge to the specialists  \u2014   punters, kickers and long snappers  \u2014   working on their craft one final time, before a game or the second half. A regulation field measures 360 feet by 160 feet, and minute by minute, much of it is overtaken by spectacle: inflatable helmets and enormous flags and meandering mascots. The commotion creates a distinct N. F. L. tableau. In the moments before the first pitch at a major league game, infielders do not dance past Little Leaguers while flipping the ball around. Nor must basketball players elude platforms for national anthem singers while running the layup line. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily use the word \u2018distracting,\u2019\u201d Giants long snapper Zak DeOssie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an occupational hazard. We\u2019ve got to get our work in, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re concerned about. Sometimes we have to dodge dogs catching Frisbees and ruin a cheerleader\u2019s routine. We don\u2019t want to do it, but we have to. \u201d DeOssie recalled feeling a twinge of guilt three seasons ago in San Diego when the specialists\u2019 preparation did, in fact, encroach on a youth cheerleading performance. \u201cThey were doing a fantastic, wonderful job, but there were three minutes to go, and we needed to get our work in,\u201d DeOssie said. \u201cWe had moms yelling at us on the sideline. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, but we need to get this done. \u2019\u201d The specialists experience this chaos largely on their own. When they run onto the field for late preparations, a less rigorous version of the full   they completed earlier, their coaches and teammates remain in the locker room. Brad Wing, the Giants\u2019 punter, stays inside long enough to hear the first part of Coach Ben McAdoo\u2019s speech before scurrying outside. The rest of the Giants file onto the sideline, with quarterbacks tossing footballs and other players jogging and stretching, but no one else joins them. When Arizona Cardinals punter Ryan Quigley played for the Jets, he treated that final   as a competition with himself, he said, identifying a section of the field  \u2014   a   window between flutists, for instance  \u2014   and then aiming his kicks there. Jets kicker Nick Folk said his primary intent during those late moments was gauging whether the conditions had shifted  \u2014   most critically, whether the wind was blowing differently. He strikes a few field goals and some kickoffs until he feels comfortable, but only after assessing which side of the field will be less populated. \u201cYou want to make sure you\u2019re not kicking toward the end where all the fire and smoke is,\u201d Folk said. Often, though, players have little choice. Not long before kickoff in Cleveland on Oct. 30, members of the Browns\u2019 1986 team formed a gantlet about 20 feet to the left of Edwards. Volunteers soon filled that space, and as they readied to unfurl a giant Browns flag, Edwards motioned to his long snapper, Tanner Purdum, to move closer to the Jets\u2019 sideline, lest they be swallowed by an    tarp. A native of Australia, Edwards said there was no sporting equivalent to the N. F. L. \u2019s   craziness in his home country, but he added that he did not mind it much. From the time the ball is snapped in a game, Edwards has about two seconds to punt it before rushers reach him, and he said the tumult of   enhanced his concentration. \u201cThe more stuff going on, the better,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThen, once you get out there, it\u2019s kind of simple. \u201d There was stuff everywhere Wing looked on Oct. 16, before the Giants played the Baltimore Ravens at MetLife Stadium. One set of volunteers came out carrying a folded banner promoting breast cancer awareness while another held an American flag. As the groups assumed their stations  \u2014   the first gathered near midfield, while the second assembled along the hash marks extending from the   line to the 20  \u2014   Wing, standing near the 50, boomed kicks toward the corner. If not for the quick reflexes of a ball boy who stuck out his hand to deflect the ball, one of Wing\u2019s punts would have struck a volunteer in the head. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit a couple of people,\u201d Wing said a few days before that game. \u201cThat usually works out for the best because they don\u2019t come back, and they know. We\u2019re focused on our job, they\u2019re focused on their job. Sometimes they get in the way of each other. \u201d The N. F. L. has not established a protocol for the hectic confluence of pomp and players. But during rehearsals, held about three hours before kickoff, individual teams often alert the   participants to the specialists\u2019 routines and remind them to stay vigilant. That vigilance extends to the specialists, whose comfort in the mundane is tested every time they play in unfamiliar venues. By now, Folk knows that at New Era Field, where the Buffalo Bills play, both teams emerge from the same tunnel, allowing him to run to the other side of the field so he can practice in relative peace. Through trial and error, the players learn to adjust their routines. DeOssie keeps mental notes on which teams have frisky mascots. \u201cWatch out for the Viking\u201d on the motorcycle, he said. The former N. F. L. punter Louie Aguiar can recall, even more than a decade after his career ended, precisely where the Oakland Raiders, the San Diego Chargers and the Miami Dolphins would appear from. At Arrowhead Stadium, his home for five seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs, Aguiar tended to linger by the numbers instead of the middle of the field, from where he preferred to punt, in order to keep away from the cheerleaders and community service personnel. Even taking those precautions, Aguiar said, he still once nearly drilled a man who walked right in front of him. \u201cHe said, \u2018Oh, sorry,\u2019\u201d Aguiar said in an interview conducted when he served on the Jets\u2019 coaching staff. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m not worried about me. I\u2019m worried about you. \u2019\u201d That quick exchange usually represents the extent of participants\u2019   interaction with players  \u2014   a terse apology, an \u201cexcuse me,\u201d maybe even a \u201cHey, watch out!\u201d  \u2014   although some might suppress their reactions. When Quigley played for the Jets, he quipped that he expected people who were almost struck by his punts to plot their revenge against him. Every so often, though, there is a tender, unscripted moment. If DeOssie leaves the locker room and sees a youth football game, he will sometimes run into the huddle and dispense  . It creates a good memory, he said, and it takes only a few seconds before he must dart away, off again to search for calm amid the mayhem.'"}, "time": 1742628527.2029355}
