First, Bob Klapisch wrote a great piece in USA Today about how he will vote for Curt Schilling to get into the Hall of Fame because he\u2019s only concerned with Schilling\u2019s performance on the field, not his politics or his tweets. [That would constitute the good.  The bad comes courtesy of New York Giants Senior Vice President of Communications Pat Hanlon, who captioned a tweet promoting Klapisch\u2019s article with a colorful message: Bob\u2019s right. Being an asshole shouldn\u2019t overshadow Schilling\u2019s   accomplishments. https:  .   \u2014   pat hanlon (@giantspathanlon) January 6, 2017,  How in the world does a senior vice president of communications with over twenty years of experience communicating in media arrive at the conclusion that he should tweet that? How does the NFL tolerate it? Is that the kind of language or conduct the league expects from their executive communicators?
