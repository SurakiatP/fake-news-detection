[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\\nAccording to this report, Federation intelligence analysts in their \u201cdeciphering/uncovering\u201d what the current US presidential election is really all about have heavily relied on \u201coutliers\u201d [a thing situated away or detached from the main body or system] such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) models, social media trends and psychological analysis of the American electorate.\\nThis report notes that the Security Councils use of these \u201coutliers\u201d to both understand and explain what is occurring during this US presidential election provides the only proven scientific evidence of what is occurring as the so called polling data used by the American propaganda media has been proven to be nothing more than a manipulation device used to keep people from voting for or supporting the anti-establishment candidate Donald Trump.\\nExamples of this being true, this report explains, lie in too many examples to fully cite\u2014but includes the once respected Monmouth University poll found manipulating data to favor Hillary Clinton , news networks NBC and CBS found manipulating polling data to show Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump when she was actually losing , and CNN manipulating their poll data to favor Hillary Clinton too .\\nUnlike manipulated polling data showing Hillary Clinton will win this election, however, this report continues, the objective and independent scientific \u201coutliers\u201d used by Security Council research analysts show not only Donald Trump winning\u2014but winning in a landslide victory.\\nEvidence proving this assertion of a Donald Trump US presidential win, this report notes, lies first with artificial intelligence analysis\u2014that includes the MogIA supercomputer showing Trump winning in landslide and showing he is more popular than President Obama , and a just released AI computer simulation showing Trump winning with 289 electoral votes compared to Clinton\u2019s 249 .\\nSocial media trend lines in this election, likewise, proves a Donald Trump landslide win in this election, this report continues, as his Facebook-Twitter-Instagram-YouTube \u201cpresence\u201d dwarfs Hillary Clinton\u2019s by a staggering 74 million \u2014and that is further validated by the over 700,000 Americans who have come to his campaign rallies, as opposed to the barely 60,000 that have attended Hillary Clinton\u2019s .\\nMost fascinating though of the \u201coutliers\u201d used in this Security Council report is the psychological analysis of the American electorate conducted by a virtually unknown US political project called \u201c We Need Smith \u201d\u2014whose scientifically conducted studies shockingly proved that anyone from a liberal Democrat, to a conservative Republican was able to win the US presidency as long as they promised to destroy the corrupt political system currently ruling America .\\nThe \u201cWe Need Smith\u201d project, this report explains, is named after a popular US Great Depression era movie called Mr. Smith Goes To Washington about a newly appointed United States Senator who fights against a corrupt political system\u2014and that during this present US presidential election only Donald Trump and US Senator Bernie Sanders fit the mold of.\\nCritical to note about the \u201cWe Need Smith\u201d project too, this report continues, is that it was co-founded by the legendary American pollster Patrick Caddell \u2014who almost singlehandedly was responsible for putting President Jimmy Carter in office in 1976, but also presided over Carter\u2019s unprecedented defeat in 1980 at the hands of the US establishments most hated candidate Ronald Reagan.\\nSeeking to understand how President Carter could go from victory to defeat in just 4 years, this report details, Patrick Caddell spent the past nearly 4 decades examining it\u2014and coming to the scientific conclusion that the conventional wisdom that America is absolutely divided into warring tribes is simply not true, they are all just tired of being lied to .\\nIn fact, this report continues, Caddell\u2019s research proved that the American political battleground is no longer over ideology but instead is all about insurgency\u2014and with a staggering 84% of the American public believing that the elites live by a different set of rules and laws than ordinary people do , anyone running against them is assured victory.\\nInterestingly to note too, this report says, is Caddell\u2019s scientific analyses showing that the hatred of the American people towards their elites comes from both the left and right \u2014and as evidenced by the equal explosive political movements known as Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party insurgencies .\\nThis report grimly concludes, however, with a warning that Soviet Communist leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s attributed statement\u2014\u201c Those who cast the votes decide nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything. \u201d\u2014may, indeed, be active in the present US presidential election after newly released secret documents revealed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s main supporter, multi-billionaire George Soros, has not only been manipulating the entire American election system , but one of his companies is, also, providing vote county software to 16 States ( they\u2019ve since denied )\u2014and that should Donald Trump have this election stolen from him the people of that nation will most surely revolt.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742562029.7870247}
