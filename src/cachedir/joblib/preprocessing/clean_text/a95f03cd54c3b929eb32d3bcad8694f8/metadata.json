Led Zeppelin did not steal the opening riff of its rock anthem \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d a federal jury ruled here, giving the band a victory in a copyright case in which millions of dollars were at stake. The case pitted an obscure song from the margins of rock history against one of the canonical hits of the genre. The suit was filed two years ago by Michael Skidmore, a trustee for the songs of Randy Wolfe, a member of the band Spirit. It contends that the Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant had lifted substantial portions of the Spirit song \u201cTaurus,\u201d from 1968, for the beginning of \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d which was released in 1971 and, by some estimates, has earned more than $500 million. Mr. Wolfe died in 1997 and complained of the similarity in interviews but never brought a suit. The case was filed shortly after a Supreme Court ruling allowed copyright infringement cases to go forward even after long delays. Lawyers for Mr. Skidmore presented evidence showing that the bands crossed paths while touring early in their careers, as well as testimony from music experts saying that both songs shared a similar chord progression and, most distinctively, a descending bass line in a chromatic scale. Mr. Plant and Mr. Page both testified that \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d had been composed independently, and that while both bands had played on the same bill a handful of times, they did not recall ever seeing Spirit perform and had no familiarity with \u201cTaurus\u201d until the lawsuit was brought. \u201cI didn\u2019t remember it then, and I don\u2019t remember it now,\u201d Mr. Plant said. The jury found that, although Mr. Page and Mr. Plant had access to \u201cTaurus\u201d before the release of \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d the two songs\u2019 original elements did not contain enough similarities. Before reaching the verdict on Thursday, the jury asked to listen to audio recordings of the introductions to both songs twice. \u201cWe are grateful for the jury\u2019s conscientious service and pleased that it has ruled in our favor, putting to rest questions about the origins of \u2018Stairway to Heaven\u2019 and confirming what we have known for 45 years,\u201d Mr. Plant and Mr. Page said in a statement on Thursday. The plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Francis Malofiy, said an appeal was being considered. The statute of limitations for past copyright infringement is three years. The two sides presented widely different estimates of Led Zeppelin\u2019s earnings from 2011 to 2014, when the case was filed. Experts for the plaintiff pointed to a $60 million music publishing deal that Mr. Page and Mr. Plant signed with Warner Music and suggested that a large portion of that could be attributed to \u201cStairway. \u201d But later in the trial, an accountant called by Led Zeppelin\u2019s side put the amounts at $615, 000 for Mr. Page and $532, 000 for Mr. Plant. The trial was the second major case in a year to involve copyright issues and the music industry, after Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay $5. 3 million to the family of Marvin Gaye over their 2013 hit \u201cBlurred Lines. \u201d That case, which has been appealed, has led to a wide debate in the music world over the limits of copyright protection, and whether the musical elements of homage  \u2014   a song\u2019s atmospherics, rhythms and overall \u201cfeel\u201d  \u2014   can cross the line into infringement.'"}, "time": 1742562315.6821816}
