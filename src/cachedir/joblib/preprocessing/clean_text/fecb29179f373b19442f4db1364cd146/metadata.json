[\u201cWe found what she did disgusting and offensive,\u201d CNN said in a statement Tuesday, according to Mediaite. \u201cWe are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down. We are evaluating our New Year\u2019s Eve coverage and have made no decisions at this point. \u201d  A picture from the photo shoot  \u2014   conducted by Griffin and Los   artist Tyler Shields  \u2014   surfaced online Tuesday morning, setting off a firestorm on social media. While some liberals defended Griffin, others condemned the photograph. Chelsea Clinton called the photo \u201cvile and wrong. \u201d Griffin initially defended herself after the photo surfaced, but then later apologized profusely in a video posted on Twitter. \u201cI sincerely apologize,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a comic. I cross the line. I move the line and then I cross it. I went way too far. The image is way too disturbing. \u201d Griffin has   CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Live broadcast every January since 2007, along with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. But even Cooper tweeted that he was offended by her actions. For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.  \u2014   Anderson Cooper (@andersoncooper) May 31, 2017, '"}, "time": 1742561946.2193813}
