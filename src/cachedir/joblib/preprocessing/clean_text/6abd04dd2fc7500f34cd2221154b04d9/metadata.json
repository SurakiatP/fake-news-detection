( Here\u2019s the ad itself .) \\nWhen we showed Facebook\u2019s racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer John Relman , he gasped and said, \u201cThis is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find.\u201d \\nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 makes it illegal \u201cto make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.\u201d Violators can face tens of thousands of dollars in fines . \\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 also prohibits the \u201cprinting or publication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference, limitation, specification or discrimination\u201d in employment recruitment. \\n{snip} \\nFacebook says its policies prohibit advertisers from using the targeting options for discrimination, harassment, disparagement or predatory advertising practices. \\n\u201cWe take a strong stand against advertisers misusing our platform: Our policies prohibit using our targeting options to discriminate, and they require compliance with the law,\u201d said Steve Satterfield, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook. \u201cWe take prompt enforcement action when we determine that ads violate our policies.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nHe said Facebook began offering the \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d categories within the past two years as part of a \u201cmulticultural advertising\u201d effort. \\nSatterfield added that the \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d is not the same as race\u2013which Facebook does not ask its members about. Facebook assigns members an \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d based on pages and posts they have liked or engaged with on Facebook. \\nWhen we asked why \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d was included in the \u201cDemographics\u201d category of its ad-targeting tool if it\u2019s not a representation of demographics, Facebook responded that it plans to move \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d to another section. \\nFacebook declined to answer questions about why our housing ad excluding minority groups was approved 15 minutes after we placed the order. \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742562704.0718946}
