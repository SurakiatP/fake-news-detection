The show, originally announced in 2015, is to premiere in New York during the   season before embarking on a   tour of \u201ctraditional and nontraditional venues,\u201d according to the Universal Music Group. \u201cI want everyone to see it,\u201d Mr. Simmons said in a phone interview on Saturday. \u201cI want kids in the \u2019hood in Detroit to see it. I want sophisticated theatergoers in New York to see it. And they\u2019re going love it whether they\u2019re 50 or 14. \u201d Mr. Simmons, 59, emphasized the intended   appeal of \u201cThe Scenario,\u201d which he said would include songs from Universal\u2019s catalog that cover rap\u2019s ascension as a dominant   force. \u201cThe difference between Rakim and Kendrick Lamar is minimal,\u201d Mr. Simmons said, referring to two   artists whose rises occurred nearly three decades apart. Tracks by Drake, Mr. Lamar, Kurtis Blow and the Sugarhill Gang are among those being strongly considered for the production, Mr. Simmons said. Universal owns Def Jam Recordings, which Mr. Simmons founded in 1984 with the producer Rick Rubin. The label, whose artists have included Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and Kanye West, is credited with helping to bring   to the mainstream. Named for a song by A Tribe Called Quest, \u201cThe Scenario\u201d will follow a few artists as they \u201cstruggle and evolve,\u201d according to Mr. Simmons, and he said the production would more closely resemble a concert than a Broadway musical. The audience will have a sizable role, playing on a    tactic often used in  . \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of technology that we\u2019ll be using to connect the audience and the stage in a way that Broadway hasn\u2019t done,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cThe Scenario\u201d will pair Mr. Simmons with Universal\u2019s Scott Landis, Def Pictures\u2019 Jake Stein and the \u201cRock of Ages\u201d producers Scott Prisand and Jamie Bendell. The author and   historian Dan Charnas (\u201cThe Big Payback\u201d) is writing the show\u2019s book. \u201cThe Scenario\u201d follows the breakout success of \u201cHamilton,\u201d the   musical that set a record for the most money ever made in a single week by a Broadway show. On Saturday, Mr. Simmons said that he loved that show and was thrilled about its success, but he bristled at the idea that its popularity has been surprising given the omnipresence of   in American life. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of insight on the part of the gatekeepers and the producers of content,\u201d he said. \u201cI can go anywhere and hear  . I think \u2018Hamilton\u2019 does help them buy in, but it\u2019s overdue. It\u2019s long overdue, and I\u2019m excited that I\u2019m part of it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563888.8191137}
