Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump\u2019s turnout,\u201d he continued. \\nThe letter also highlighted several other challenges the Clinton team faced throughout the campaign, including a desire for change after two terms by a Democratic president and the reluctance of some Americans to vote for a female candidate.

These numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states,\u201d he said. \\nThe FBI director angered Democrats late in October by announcing in a letter to Congress that the agency had uncovered new emails connected to the Clinton email investigation. \\nJust over a week later, Comey notified Congress that Clinton would not face charges over the newly discovered messages. \\nNayak said Comey\u2019s letters encouraged Trump supporters and depressed the turnout for Clinton on Election Day. \\n\u201cThere is no question that a week from Election Day, Sec. Clinton was poised for a historic win. In the end, less than 110K votes out of tens of millions cast on Election Day made the difference in this race,\u201d he wrote. \\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d Nayak concluded, \u201clate breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome.\u201d \\nClinton had been leading Trump throughout the campaign in most of the polls except for the last week of the election when she lost ground to Trump.'"}, "time": 1742564303.1889868}
