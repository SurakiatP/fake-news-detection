To it\u2019s credit the team has rejected the demands. [Gay activists are upset that the Cardinals have allowed Berkman to be the spokesman of \u201cChristian Day\u201d because he recently spoke out against transgender boys posing as girls in school locker rooms. As Paul Mirengoff reported, Berkman said:  The issue is, what to do about a 15 or    boy who thinks he\u2019s a girl and wants to shower with the girls. Maybe he is [transgender] maybe he\u2019s confused. But I wouldn\u2019t want him in the shower with my daughters. We shouldn\u2019t have the rights of 2 percent of the population trump the rights of the other 98 percent. In an interview, Berman added, \u201cTo me, tolerance is the virtue that\u2019s killing this country. We\u2019re tolerant of everything. You know everything is OK, and as long as you want to do it and as long as it feels good to you then it\u2019s perfectly acceptable do it. Those are the kinds of things that lead you down a slippery slope, and you\u2019ll get in trouble in a hurry. \u201d LGBTQ in St. Louis was outraged by the player\u2019s comments. A spokesman for St. Louis Pride said they were \u201cdisappointed by the decision of the St. Louis Cardinals to provide a public platform for Berkman, an individual whose words and actions towards the LGBTQ+ are divisive and demeaning. \u201d To their credit, the Cardinals have resisted the demands made by the   activists to remove Berkman or cancel the July 30 \u201cChristian Day\u201d promotion. In a statement, the team said it sees nothing wrong with its sponsorship of Christian Day. \u201cThe Cardinals have hosted a Christian Day at the ballpark for nearly three decades,\u201d the team said in its statement. \u201cThe   event usually features a   keynote speaker (often a former Cardinal or professional athlete) who talks about his or her experience of being a practicing Christian in the public arena. \u201cLance Berkman participated in Christian Day when he was a Cardinals player, and we welcome him back this year to discuss his faith. \u201d The ball team points out that it has a large number of special promotional days to bring members of the community together. \u201cAs an organization, the Cardinals have always been committed to bringing   groups together to share in the unifying experience of Cardinals baseball,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe are an inclusive organization with a social responsibility to be welcoming to all types of people and organizations. \u201cWe continue to try and reach out to every part of our community, and have hosted a variety of themed events like Christian Day, Jewish Community Night, Catholic Family Night, Bosnian Heritage Night, Fiesta Cardenales, and many others. \u201cWe are excited to announce that we will be hosting our first Pride Night later this season (details to follow shortly) which will bring members of the LGBT Community together to enjoy Cardinals baseball. \u201d Despite the pressure, the Cardinals have signaled full speed ahead with its Christian Day promotion.
