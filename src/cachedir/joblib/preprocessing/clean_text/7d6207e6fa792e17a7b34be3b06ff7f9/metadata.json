The   demonstrations that took place in the wake of the president\u2019s inauguration were protests, he said, of the \u201csavage capitalism and unprecedented greed that he represents, and to the dangers he could bring upon the world. \u201d  \u201cWhat gives me hope is that Trump\u2019s insistence on repeating his mistakes and his provocative and   statements will nurture this awakening [movement and keep it alive],\u201d he wrote in the paper translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) in a new report highlighting the Palestinian mood regarding Trump\u2019s presidency. It is puzzling that nations, no matter how civilized, keep repeating the same mistakes when exercising their right to hold democratic elections.   \u2026     The Palestinian people made this mistake in 2006 when it elected Hamas in a moment of frustration, despair and rage [while] the civilized and educated German people elected Hitler and his Nazi party. Barhoum decried Trump\u2019s \u201cuse of the threat of radical Islam as a bogeyman. \u201d Meanwhile, Hassan Khader, a columnist for the Palestinian Authority\u2019s   paper, made the following morbid prediction: \u201cIf the Americans do not manage to drive Donald Trump out of the White House, he will drive democracy out of their land. \u201d Khader echoed Barhoum\u2019s comparisons with Nazi Germany, save for one important distinction. While Hitler regarded Jews as the source of all of Germany\u2019s problems, Trump regards immigrants and Muslims as \u201can enemy responsible for all the problems that plague the U. S. and its citizens. \u201d PLO Executive Committee Secretary and former negotiator Saeb Erekat said Trump\u2019s \u201crightwing extremism\u201d was reminiscent of   War II Europe. Also in the official Palestinian rag     Omar   asserted that \u201cTrump suffers from megalomania and narcissism stemming from unbelievable arrogance. This dangerous tendency does not bode well for the U. S. and its people. \u201d He added that the new president was \u201ca reckless, arrogant and racist man for whom tact and respect for the other are foreign concepts. \u201d \u201cThat the billionaire Trump has been elected U. S. president poses a tangible danger to [America\u2019s] status and role [in the world, and endangers] the capitalist West, since his positions and statements reveal that he means to divide the capitalist West and turn the world and its international institutions upside down,\u201d   concluded. \u201cThis can change the entire system of international relations. Hence, the [world\u2019s] leaders and countries must take precautions and [prepare for] various scenarios so as to avoid [being harmed by] surprising decisions that the new U. S. president might take. The logical conclusion to draw regarding the future is that, in the Trump era, the U. S. will be at a crossroads. \u201d As soon as Trump came into power, Palestinian officials expressed their fear that the new administration would be biased towards Israel, supporting settlement expansion and a possible embassy transfer to Jerusalem. Maen Erekat, chief of the PLO delegation in Washington, said that any credibility the U. S. has left in the Middle East will suffer greatly if \u201cTrump takes positions that are clearly biased towards Israel and its policy that violates international law and the UN resolutions. \u201d Fatah official Nabil Sha\u2019ath told the Hamas publication  : \u201cThe coming period is dangerous for the Palestinians in the shadow of the Trump administration and of an extremist government in Israel headed by Netanyahu. \u201d Fatah Central Committee Member Abbas Zaki criticized Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who is an open supporter of the settlements. He further warned that if Trump follows through with his promise to move the embassy it would \u201copen the gates of hell. \u201d He added that the Americans will \u201close if they do not back down. \u201d \u201cNo one can divide the Muslims,\u201d he wrote. Fatah Central Committee Member Nasr   said that an embassy transfer would be a \u201cclear assault\u201d against the Palestinian people and would result in the closure of the Palestinian mission in Washington. \u201cThe Palestinian side will sever its ties with the official staffers of the U. S. Embassy that will be illegally situated in Jerusalem,\u201d he wrote. He added that the move would instigate \u201cpopular action,\u201d an apparent euphemism for mass violence, and added that he predicts \u201ca great deal of fury\u201d from the Muslim and Arab world. Speaking on the official Palestinian Authority TV channel on January 18, Fatah Central Committee member Jibril Rajoub referred to Trump as a \u201clunatic\u201d and said that the embassy relocation was a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d against the whole world. Rajoub said, \u201cWe want the confrontation to be between this new Fascist in the White House and the whole world  \u2014   Christians as well as Muslims. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628580.139174}
