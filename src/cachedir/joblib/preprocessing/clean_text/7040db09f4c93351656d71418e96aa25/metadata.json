An officer then escorts him to the toilet and signs a notebook that Maher carries, authorizing his release until 6 that evening. Maher walks a mile to his apartment  \u2014   \u201cIt is my only exercise,\u201d he said  \u2014   in the Third Settlement, a grid of   tenements at the edge of the desert. After breakfast with his wife and two small children, he takes care of chores aimed at rebuilding his life  \u2014   renewing his driver\u2019s license, reactivating his cellphone he visits friends and family and searches for a job in civil engineering, his occupation before he was clapped into prison. Whatever he does, he must be back at the police station before sundown. \u201cEvery second now is important,\u201d said Maher, a slight    with a full beard, large eyes obscured behind tinted yellow lenses and a gray woolen ski cap that covered his bald pate. \u201cIf I want to visit my mother in Maadi, I can spend three hours getting there and back. \u201d The clock is ticking. \u201cIf I delay for 15 minutes, the police have the right to send me back to prison,\u201d he said. Maher and I were sitting in his small, dark apartment at 3 o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon in February, waiting for his children to return from their first day back at school after a   vacation. A television played a soccer match in a corner, and a coffee table was strewn with textbooks from Maher\u2019s studies at Cairo University, where he is pursuing a second degree, in political science, this one begun behind bars. It was just six years ago that Maher was celebrated around the world as a symbol of freedom and democracy. In January 2011, as the leader of a    network of young activists called the April 6 Youth Movement, Maher mobilized hundreds of thousands of Egyptians in demonstrations in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square and across the country that took down President Hosni Mubarak. The movement was considered for a Nobel Peace Prize, and Maher traveled across Europe and the United States talking about the Arab Spring and Egypt\u2019s future with the likes of Ban   and Lech Walesa. But the hopes that were raised by the revolution dissolved into sectarianism and chaos, and Maher\u2019s aspirations were extinguished within two years. Abdel Fattah   the defense minister and commander in chief of the armed forces, seized power in July 2013 and outlawed protests. Five months later, a judge found Maher guilty of illegal demonstration, rioting and \u201cthuggery\u201d and sentenced him to three years in jail. Another judge added six months to Maher\u2019s sentence for \u201cverbally assaulting a public officer while on duty\u201d after he demanded that the police remove his handcuffs while in court for a 2014 appeal. Maher spent almost all of that period sealed in a small cell in a   wing at Tora Prison, a notorious complex on the outskirts of Cairo, built during British rule, that houses about 2, 500 political prisoners and common criminals. Hidden behind    walls, the vast compound encompasses seven prison blocks, ranging from a   facility for policemen and judges convicted of taking bribes to the supermax \u201cScorpion Prison,\u201d a labyrinth of cells largely reserved for Islamists and April 6 leaders. Today Maher is nominally a free man, but the restrictions on his movements are stifling. The regime is deeply concerned that he could revive the   network that brought his followers to the streets six years ago. As it was explained to Maher, \u201ctweets can lead to demonstrations, and demonstrations can lead to revolution, and that will bring down the regime and create martyrs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you are tweeting, you are like a terrorist. \u201d Every day for the next three years, Maher must spend 12 of every 24 hours at his local police station, a \u201csurveillance period\u201d intended to ensure that he refrains from   activity. Under Egyptian law, he told me,   felons \u201chave the right to have their surveillance inside the home with a guard downstairs. But they are using this surveillance as punishment. It is a kind of control to keep me all the time under pressure. \u201d The front door opened, and Maher\u2019s wife, Reham, their daughter, Meral, 9, and their son, Nidal, 5, spilled into the room. Nidal raced to the television, switched it from the soccer match to a cartoon and then snuggled up to his father. \u201cI missed these moments,\u201d Maher said. During his incarceration, his contact with the children was limited to short visits twice a month. The encounters left his kids perplexed and disturbed. \u201cAt first I lied when they would visit me,\u201d Maher recalled. \u201cMy daughter asked, \u2018Why you are not in our home?\u2019 and I said, \u2018This is my job.\u2019 She said, \u2018So why are you wearing blue? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Reham, who met Maher at Cairo University 16 years ago and married him in 2007, told me that after a year they decided to explain the situation to their daughter. \u201cI tried to make her grasp the difference between being detained for political reasons and being a common criminal,\u201d Reham said. \u201cI explained what the revolution was and how people protested. And I told her that when the current regime took over, it didn\u2019t allow people to express their opinions. Sisi knew what happened to Mubarak, so he didn\u2019t want them to speak out again. \u201d In prison, Maher earned a reputation as a defiant figure, repeatedly sending antigovernment criticism and vivid descriptions of his ordeal to the Western and Egyptian news media. \u201cWhen I heard the president talk about the rule of law and human rights in Egypt, I said, \u2018What is this bullshit? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cThat made me want to write about the reality. \u201d Denied pens and paper, he scribbled messages on tissues, using pens smuggled into his cell, and managed to smuggle the notes out. After they were published, guards would tear apart his cell, removing bricks from walls to search for hiding places. They confiscated his books, radio and clothes, leaving him with only his thin prison uniform. At one point, they covered the open exercise yard with a tarpaulin, blotting out the sunlight, suspecting that Maher might somehow be smuggling messages through the air. Still he continued devising acts of rebellion. A year into his confinement, Maher grew an extravagant handlebar mustache and a long beard and then braided it. \u201cIt bothered them  \u2014   it seemed like I was making fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prison officials complained to my father. They said, \u2018Please tell him to shave. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d After getting out of jail, Maher decided to keep wearing facial hair it helped disguise his identity. Maher\u2019s face is widely recognized in Egypt, and other April 6 Youth Movement leaders have been physically attacked by regime loyalists who blame them for plunging the country into instability and violence. When his wife enrolled their children in private school after Maher was sentenced to prison, she told the administrators that their father was \u201cout of the country on business. \u201d The school never connected their father\u2019s name to the famous activist, and even now, Maher said, when he picks his children up from their school, the staff has no idea who he is. Maher had to be careful with what he told me the regime might send him back to prison if he criticized Sisi too harshly. \u201cEven if it was something minor, they would jail him,\u201d Reham said. \u201cIt would be a catastrophe for us. \u201d Yet Maher\u2019s reluctance runs against all his instincts. Since his release, he has sensed a deepening anger toward the regime, and he believes that the political climate may be changing. \u201cPeople tell me that they can see through the lies,\u201d he said, \u201cand that they are supporting us. \u201d Sisi\u2019s crackdown on the opposition far exceeds the darkest period of repression during the Mubarak era. Human rights groups claim that as many as 60, 000 political prisoners now languish in Egypt\u2019s jails. (At the end of Mubarak\u2019s rule, the figure was between 5, 000 and 10, 000.) Egypt\u2019s prisons are filled to triple their capacity, and the regime has built 16 more prisons to handle the overflow. Once described by Amnesty International as \u201cGeneration Protest,\u201d the youths who took to the streets in Egypt to bring down a dictator in 2011 have acquired a grim new nickname: \u201cGeneration Jail. \u201d Many Egyptians have accepted Sisi\u2019s argument that another prolonged round of protests could invite radical Islamists to capitalize on the chaos. \u201cHe\u2019s positioned himself as the sole leader who makes decisions because he knows what\u2019s best for the nation, and he\u2019s saving us from the fate of Syria and Libya,\u201d Khaled Dawoud, a prominent Egyptian journalist and the leader of a small opposition party, told me. Egyptians are proud that the first Arab leader to whom President Trump spoke after his electoral victory was Sisi, a sharp contrast to Barack Obama, who had suspended military aid to Egypt for two years after the police massacre of 1, 000 Muslim Brotherhood supporters in August 2013 at Rabaa, a Cairo encampment. Obama never invited the Egyptian president to the White House. \u201cThe thinking is, Egypt is returning to its rightful place as a player,\u201d said a veteran political observer in Cairo, who like many officials I spoke to feared retribution for discussing even   elements of Sisi\u2019s policies. Sisi\u2019s crackdown has unfolded amid one of the most expansive overhauls of the legal system in Egyptian history. After declaring a state of emergency and disbanding Parliament in 2013, he issued a series of presidential decrees that granted him unprecedented power to silence his critics. A protest law enacted in November 2013 requires three days\u2019 notification before a demonstration can take place and gives the Interior Ministry the right to \u201ccancel, postpone or move\u201d the protest if it determines protesters will \u201cbreach . .. the law. \u201d Broad new counterterrorism laws have expanded the definition of terrorism to include civil disobedience this gives prosecutors latitude to roll over   pretrial detention periods, in many cases without limit. And once a case gets to court, a compliant judiciary, long regarded as hostile to the opposition, has been unforgiving in its sentencing. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily conservative institution,\u201d one official told me, explaining that judges tend to favor a \u201cmaximalist approach\u201d to eliminate threats to the public order and safeguard their own interests. \u201cThey are overwhelmingly the children of judges, like gondoliers in Venice. It is a family business. \u201d According to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, a watchdog group in Cairo, the minister of justice has fired almost half of the 75 judges who called for more democracy in an open letter to Sisi and replaced them with  . Two hundred others have been sidelined with administrative chores or have left the country. One of the most notorious magistrates, Mohammed Nagy Shehata, known as the \u201cexecutioner judge,\u201d a holdover from the Mubarak era, has handed out hundreds of lengthy prison terms and death sentences to   activists. In early 2016, Shehata sentenced three young members of April 6, who were attending a memorial service for a murdered comrade when they were arrested, to life terms for protesting without a license, possessing fireworks and spreading false information. (The sentences were later reduced to 10 years.) In June 2014, another Cairo judge sentenced 25 peaceful demonstrators, some of them teenagers, to 15 years for violating the protest law, blocking roads and attacking public institutions. \u201cKids are going to jail for four or five years,\u201d Dawoud said, \u201cbeing portrayed as anarchists and terrorists. No country in the world jails its young people for that long for demonstrating peacefully. \u201d During the Mubarak era, he said, \u201cI would take part in demonstrations and spend three days in a police station. We got released because we were students, and they were not going to destroy our future. There is no more of that kind of thinking. \u201d Sameh Samir, a lawyer with the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a nongovernmental organization that defends many protesters, told me that his office has been overwhelmed by the caseload. \u201cThey are making random arrests, just sweeping people off the streets,\u201d he said. The regime has hampered the ability of human rights groups like Samir\u2019s to defend protesters, freezing their bank accounts and making it increasingly difficult to accept foreign funds, often a lifeline for such organizations. Ten and a Half Kilometers Camp, a collection of concrete bungalows surrounded by a fence just off the    highway, typifies the prisons of the Sisi era. Built under Mubarak to house violent Islamists, the camp today serves as a pretrial detention facility for Islamists and a handful of secular political prisoners. A founding member of April 6 named Ayman, who did not want his last name mentioned, landed there in December 2015 after participating in an illegal protest. Thrown into a      cell with 35 Islamists, he slept amid a crush of other prisoners on a blanket on the concrete floor. They defecated in a hole surrounded by curtains and were never permitted to leave the cell. \u201cYou need to take the word \u2018privacy\u2019 out of your dictionary if you are going to survive,\u201d he told me. After two weeks, Ayman was moved into a tiny disciplinary cell with 11 other prisoners to await interrogation. They shared a few thin blankets, drank unpurified water from a rusty pipe and survived on one piece of stale bread and cheese each day. A fluorescent light in the   ceiling shone day and night. \u201cWe learned how to get it unscrewed by standing on each other\u2019s shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to use a little acrobatics. \u201d Twice during his 26 days in the unit, he was shaken awake in the night, blindfolded, taken to an interrogation room and questioned for hours. \u201cThey asked me how the hierarchy of April 6 worked, how do we communicate,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t give them any names. \u201d The authorities finally moved him to Al Kanatar Prison, 15 miles from Cairo, where, after 20 days, a judge ordered his release. Ayman said that many of the prisoners he met were from the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political organization that briefly held power after Mubarak. The group formally renounced violence in the early 1970s, but Ayman watched his cellmates grow hardened in prison. \u201cThe torture and unjust imprisonment for long periods without clear charges or trial dates created human bombs,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one of them was just waiting to get out. They are so thirsty for revenge. \u201d Last April, when he heard that the authorities were again looking for him, Ayman sought refuge in South Africa, where his wife and two young daughters eventually joined him. Egypt\u2019s slide back into authoritarianism wasn\u2019t foreordained. Today the leaders of April 6 admit that they weren\u2019t prepared for the challenges that followed their initial success. Many of them were barely out of their teens Maher, from a politically aware,   family in Cairo, had built the group online, connecting on Facebook and embracing   techniques that he learned while demonstrating for human rights and judicial independence with a small   movement. He was beaten and jailed repeatedly. The group took its name from the date of a   strike in Cairo that Maher organized in 2008 in solidarity with textile workers in the Nile Delta. That led to small demonstrations against corruption and police brutality, which were quickly broken up by Mubarak\u2019s security forces. Then, on Jan. 25, 2011, a protest march on Egypt\u2019s National Police Day exploded into a nationwide movement. Late that morning, Maher watched with amazement as crowds filled Tahrir Square and said: \u201cWe made a revolution! We made a revolution!\u201d Days after the Feb. 11 resignation of Mubarak, one of the world\u2019s   tyrants, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, a transitional military body, sent a bus to pick up Maher and three other protest leaders and took them to a villa owned by   officials. Sisi, then the intelligence chief, and two other generals greeted them respectfully, Maher recalled. \u201cSisi said: \u2018You are heroes. You did miracles. You brought down Mubarak. You did something we failed to do for years. But now we need you to stop demonstrating. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Maher and the others rejected Sisi\u2019s request. \u201cWe said: \u2018The revolution is not complete. We need to change the cabinet, change the structure of the government.\u2019 We kept sending them demands. \u201d Over the next six months, Maher met with Sisi three times. \u201cWe said the same, and he said the same. \u2018We need to stop demonstrating stand together against the enemies.\u2019 Sisi always hated the protests. \u201d After Mubarak\u2019s downfall, Maher traveled to the United States and captivated students in gatherings at New York University, Harvard, M. I. T. and American University, and met with leaders of the   community. In Europe, he talked politics and revolution with the first vice president of the European Commission, Catherine Ashton officials from the United Nations Human Rights Council and Green Party and Social Democratic representatives to the European Parliament in Brussels. Western diplomats and politicians underestimated the structural weakness of the secular democrats, the   appeal of the Islamists and the entrenched power of the \u201cdeep state\u201d  \u2014   military intelligence and the state security apparatus. Back in Egypt, the April 6 leaders searched for a strategy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a vision,\u201d admitted Walid Shawky, a dentist and a member of the April 6 Political Committee. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an answer for what comes next. \u201d Maher struggled to articulate an ideology, vaguely describing the group\u2019s leanings as \u201csocial democratic, social liberal\u201d  \u2014   somewhere between unfettered capitalism and   communism. There were debates between those who wanted to transform April 6 into a secular political party that would challenge the Muslim Brotherhood and those, like Maher, who believed that such a transformation was too ambitious. The Brotherhood \u201coutnumbered us 10 to one,\u201d he told me. \u201cI thought that being a pressure group to write a new Constitution would be a better role for us. \u201d April 6 began an awareness campaign throughout the country. \u201cWe used to go out with slide projectors in rural areas, teaching people of all the [human rights] violations made by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces,\u201d recalls Mamdouh Gamal, one of tens of thousands of youths who joined the movement in the immediate aftermath of the revolution. He has since left it. While April 6 members continued their activism, the Islamists cemented their political advantage. The Muslim Brotherhood won parliamentary and presidential elections but enraged much of the population when it tried to draft a Constitution based largely on fundamentalist Islamic principles. By the end of 2012, Egypt was in chaos. \u201cThere were street fights, people at one another\u2019s throats, a real possibility of civil war,\u201d remembered Dawoud, the journalist. April 6 gave its support to Tamarod, a   movement that gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures favoring early elections that, they believed, would remove the Muslim Brotherhood from power. Maher believed that they had the military\u2019s support. Instead, on July 3, 2013, Sisi went on television and announced that he was deposing President Mohammed Morsi and seizing power. He suspended the Constitution, disbanded Parliament, declared a state of emergency, ordered the arrests of Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders and then in August began the deadly attack on the Brotherhood protest camp at Rabaa. After nearly two years of turmoil, many Egyptians were desperate for stability, and April 6 suddenly found itself lacking any popular support. \u201cAt that time, there was not one person in the street who was against Sisi,\u201d recalled Amal Sharaf, the April 6 spokeswoman for the foreign media. After the killings, Sharaf said, \u201cwe tried to make protests, and we got beaten. People with hammers and knives were chasing us. There was a lot of ugliness. \u201d Days after the coup, the interim president, Adly Mansour, a former Constitutional Court chief justice who was appointed by Sisi as a figurehead civilian leader, summoned Maher to the presidential palace. \u201cHe was asked to go on trips to Western countries and say, \u2018This was not a coup, but something the people had asked for,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d said Ayman, the April 6 founding member. \u201cMaher and the whole leadership of the movement refused to do it. We said, \u2018This is a military coup  \u2014   people asked for an early election. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d (Maher won\u2019t comment on the incident.) The movement\u2019s leaders publicly denounced the Rabaa killings as a \u201cmassacre,\u201d further antagonizing Sisi and sealing the group\u2019s fate. Maher was arrested on Nov. 30 and sent to Tora Prison. In 2014, as Maher and other April 6 leaders languished in jail, Egypt\u2019s Court for Urgent Matters, one of Sisi\u2019s favored tools for stifling dissent, banned the group\u2019s activities, accusing it of espionage and defaming the state. Last winter, Amr Ali, who succeeded Maher as the April 6 general coordinator, received a   sentence for conspiring to overthrow the government and joining an illegal organization, another crippling blow to the movement. \u201cThe case against us is not finished,\u201d said Mohammed Samy, the acting coordinator of the outlawed movement. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to capture that many people now, so they put this case in the drawer, and when they want to recapture us, they will open it again. \u201d The government remains resolute. \u201cApril 6 was not at all a peaceful organization,\u201d said a top Egyptian official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cIt was an anarchist movement that used violence against the security forces and incited violence. They said, \u2018We have to topple the government. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d When I pressed him for an example of such violence, he cited, without offering proof, an April 6 member who, during the revolution, \u201cseized a gun from a police officer and threw it in the Nile. \u201d One November afternoon in Cairo, I rode in a taxi along the bank of the Nile, passing the former site of Mubarak\u2019s riverside National Democratic Party headquarters, now an empty lot. Set on fire and gutted by mobs of angry protesters in February 2011, the abandoned hulk was finally torn down more than a year ago, ridding the regime of a potent symbol of revolt. \u201cWe woke up one morning, and it was gone,\u201d my translator told me. We soon found ourselves in Tahrir Square. Though protests still take place there from time to time  \u2014     students assembled there last June to denounce corruption in Egypt\u2019s abysmal education system  \u2014   the police quickly break them up with tear gas. While the stability imposed by Sisi has gained him wide support, he has staked his presidency on an economic turnaround that has not materialized. Tourism has collapsed, and the regime spent over $8 billion on a huge expansion of the Suez Canal, a money pit that depleted   supplies and set off shortages of sugar, medicine and rice. Sisi alienated poor Egyptians by raising the price of gasoline and instituting a tax to obtain a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Two days before my arrival last November, the regime devalued the Egyptian pound by 48 percent to combat a black market that has siphoned almost all hard currency from the legal economy. Many economists applauded the move, but the punitive effects were being felt by everyone from   drivers to an administrator at an international high school in Cairo. The school was suddenly facing a doubling of its expenses, because its expatriate teachers were paid in euros. \u201cWe may not last until the end of the year,\u201d he told me. I met the school administrator at an evening soiree, attended mostly by gay Egyptians, including my translator, and hosted by a European diplomat at his elegant apartment in a building a few blocks from the Nile. The atmosphere was festive but rife with anxiety: In a sweeping crackdown, the police have been shutting gay bars and nightclubs, entrapping gay people using online dating sites, even raiding private homes in the name of debauchery and prostitution laws. The persecution has gone far beyond the Mubarak regime\u2019s sporadic attacks on the gay community. Over cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Egyptian red wine, I chatted with a towering bearded man who had spent four years as a closeted member of a Salafist sect in Alexandria. \u201cI hated myself, and I thought being a Salafist would cure me of being gay,\u201d he told me. He had fallen in love with another fundamentalist, a Syrian who jilted him and joined the refugee flood to Europe. The man had returned to the gay scene in Alexandria and Cairo  \u2014   but the oppressive atmosphere has made it nearly impossible for him to mix socially with other gay men. \u201cWe have never seen anything like this in Egypt,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople are terrified. \u201d (A few days after I left Egypt, my translator would seek, and eventually gain, humanitarian asylum in Germany, claiming that the crackdown on gay Egyptians had endangered him.) Around midnight, the host cleared furniture from the salon, and the crowd gathered around the perimeter of the room to watch the evening\u2019s entertainment. A lithe,   man danced erotically around another man swathed in a black burqa, prying apart the second man\u2019s legs and removing a beach ball, a teddy bear and other objects and tossing them around the salon. The lewdly choreographed show, taking place out of sight of Sisi\u2019s ubiquitous security forces, seemed an act of defiance. Yet I was asked repeatedly not to identify the location of the party or anything else that might compromise those in attendance. The country\u2019s security forces have displayed their unbridled power in other startling ways. Last year, Ziad Hassan Qenawy, a    from the Cairo exurb of Al Shorouk, was detained at Cairo Airport with his father and hauled into court to face sentencing for six guilty verdicts handed down in absentia, ranging from theft to \u201cresisting the authorities. \u201d Each was punishable by a year in prison. The boy\u2019s lawyer, Mahmoud Al Shinawy, calls the case a revenge plot against the father, an affluent businessman who had refused to submit to a police shakedown. In the courtroom, Shinawy told me: \u201cI had to lift Ziad up so the judge could see him. When the judge saw me carrying the boy, he asked me, \u2018Why are you bringing your son to the court?\u2019 I said: \u2018This is not my son. This is the defendant. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Ziad was given suspended sentences, \u201cbut he now has a criminal record,\u201d Shinawy said. \u201cIt will last for his entire life, and he will lose many rights. \u201d Egypt\u2019s byzantine justice system seemed to be assiduous in sweeping up toddlers. Last February, a military court found    Ahmed Mansour Qorani Sharara and 115 others guilty of killing three people and damaging private and public property during a   Brotherhood demonstration. Ahmed was sentenced to life in prison, but the verdict was later thrown out of court. The police insist that it was a case of mistaken identity and that the real culprit, a teenager, is still being sought. One November evening, I met my translator at El Horreya cafe, an    beer hall that served as a refuge for protesters fleeing the crush of humanity and occasional clouds of tear gas in Tahrir Square. Today it is a popular   hangout for journalists, leftists and members of Cairo\u2019s beleaguered L. G. B. T. community. Together we headed for a meeting with an original member of the April 6 movement who has also been caught up in the purgatory of Sisi\u2019s courts and prisons. He had spent five months in jail for organizing the April 2016 protest against Sisi\u2019s transfer of two uninhabited islands, Tiran and Sanafir, in the Gulf of Aqaba, to Saudi Arabia, apparently in a quid pro quo for desperately needed hard currency, gas and oil. (Egypt\u2019s State Council, in a rare display of independence, later ruled the transfer illegal.) The activist had been given a provisional release weeks earlier and had broken a few appointments with me already, but this evening, he promised to make an appearance. My translator and I walked through the downtown streets, past stray dogs and cats feasting on piles of garbage in alleys, past derelict   buildings that looked dangerously close to collapse. After 15 minutes, we arrived at the Eish and Malh bistro, a      joint. The April 6 organizer, a skinny    with square   glasses, a white Tour de France shirt, a thin beard and a mop of curly black hair, was smoking furiously at a round table in the center of the large room. He insisted on being quoted anonymously, only to change his mind, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone who reads this to feel it\u2019s a fabrication,\u201d before anxiously changing his mind again. He recounted how plainclothes security men had jumped out of five cars at the April demonstration, punched and   him, then pushed him inside one of the vehicles and blindfolded him on the way to the security headquarters. He spent the next five months in pretrial detention, before a judge ordered his strictly supervised release. Every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday afternoon, in a ritual that mimics Maher\u2019s, he walks or takes a   from his home to the local police station and sits on a bench for two hours, a humiliating routine that \u201chas made it impossible for me to have a normal life,\u201d he told me, lighting another cigarette. Around us, young Egyptians smoked, ate pizza and worked on their MacBooks, having settled back into their quotidian lives six years after Egypt\u2019s aborted revolution and three years after Sisi\u2019s military coup. At the end of five months, the organizer must appear again before a judge  \u2014   who could renew his probation or send him back to jail. He checked his watch and told me he could talk for only 10 minutes more. He was worried that he would be picked up again if he stayed any longer. \u201cI know that I am always being observed, and it drives you to an obsession,\u201d he said. \u201cI have thought about going abroad, but I need to be more psychologically stable first. I need to have the safe feeling, so that I can organize my life again. \u201d (His anxieties about being rearrested proved well founded. In February, the police detained him without explanation for six hours when he arrived late for that day\u2019s scheduled detention, he was sent back to prison for 18 days.) As he stood up to leave the pizza parlor, I asked him if the campaign for democracy had accomplished anything. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it was a waste,\u201d he told me after a pause. \u201cIt created a feeling, a space, even if we don\u2019t have that now. Even if the people are afraid again, that experience was so important. In spite of everything, I believe it was worth it. \u201d In February, I returned to Cairo to meet Maher, who was released from prison on Jan. 5. As the April 6 leader prepared to report for his own far stricter surveillance, I asked him whether this routine, a constant reminder of the unyielding power of the state, demoralized him. Maher shrugged. He had recently finished reading Samuel Huntington\u2019s 1991 book, \u201cThe Third Wave: Democratization in the Late 20th Century,\u201d and he believed that history would prove his efforts worthwhile. \u201cHuntington wrote that waves of revolution are greater than waves of counterrevolution,\u201d Maher said. \u201cSo it\u2019s three steps forward, two steps back. \u201d A friend picked up Maher at his home, and I followed them in my car to the station. The sun was sinking low over the desert as I drove down the wide street leading from Maher\u2019s home, past shabby apartment blocks with laundry drying on every balcony and stunted palm trees lining the meridian. I parked at the bottom of a hill, across the street from the gated police compound, an Egyptian flag fluttering over the entrance. The wail of a muezzin wafted across the neighborhood four officers stood inside a   guard post just before the gate. The driver embraced Maher and then motored away. Maher wore his woolen ski cap and carried a black satchel containing a novel and a dinner that Reham had prepared for him. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he told me, hoisting the bag over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll find out what it is when I get inside. \u201d Then he crossed the road, walked past the four unsmiling policemen and disappeared into the shadows.'"}, "time": 1742564562.7505398}
