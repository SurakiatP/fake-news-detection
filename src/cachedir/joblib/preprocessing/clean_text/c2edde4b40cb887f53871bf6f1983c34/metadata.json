Kamala Harris ( ) was interrupted during her questioning of the witnesses and called \u201chysterical\u201d by former Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller, the   agreed calling a woman hysterical is sexist.    Joy Behar said, \u201cSo the former aide Jason Miller it was said he was being hysterical, quote, unquote. Do you think they would use the word hysterical against a male senator?   Sunny Hostin said, \u201cThey would never do it, and I know Kamila Harris. She is one of the most   stately people. She is a former prosecutor and she was using that experience to kind of   him. Don\u2019t we want that?   Sara Haines added, \u201cThe interesting thing about the word hysterical is its a word with a female baiting history. From hysterics which was a diagnosis reserved exclusively for women sending them uncontrollably insane and they would have to perform a hysterectomy. It\u2019s actually just unique to a woman and her uterus. \u201d Jedediah Bila fought back saying, \u201cIf you watch her, and I have watched her repeatedly, she doesn\u2019t oftentimes let people answer the question. That is a fact. She doesn\u2019t let them answer to the point where they are, like, \u2018can I answer the question?\u2019 You need to be careful in this country or anywhere when you label everything sexist. She is a big girl, smart and confident and capable. I don\u2019t need to feel sorry for her in this situation. \u201d Hostin said, \u201cCalling a woman hysterical is sexist. \u201d Bila conceded, \u201cOK, that\u2019s fine. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN '"}, "time": 1742563217.8087704}
