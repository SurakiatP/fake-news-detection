[\u201cWe have no doubt President Trump is on our side,\u201d Tom Zawistowski, president of the We the People Convention and   Ohio Tea Party leader, tells Breitbart News.  \u201cThis is between the Tea Party movement and the conservative movement, on the one hand, and establishment Republicans, on the other hand,\u201d the veteran Tea Party activist adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this act before,\u201d Zawistowski notes. \u201cGive us the House, we need the Senate, they say. Give us the Senate, we need the White House. Give us the White House, we need 60 votes in the Senate,\u201d Zawistowski says. \u201cWe\u2019re not playing these games any more,\u201d he declares. \u201cThey can\u2019t pass their bill without us. We won\u2019t pass their bill unless we get what we want, need, and deserve  \u2014   full repeal of Obamacare, and free market replacement. The Art of the Deal says people who can afford to walk away from the table win. Trump needs a deal and he needs to support our position to get one,\u201d Zawistowski concludes. Other Tea Party activists around the country share Zawistowski\u2019s trust in Trump. \u201cI certainly understand what I believe to be the strategy of a phased approach. President Trump and Speaker Ryan have talked about a three phased approach to repeal and replace Obamacare. I understand it\u2019s a complex issue. I trust this president,\u201d Mark Skoda, founder of America First Tennessee and organizer of the March 4   Spirit of America rally in Nashville, tells Breitbart News. \u201cMy biggest concern is that they aren\u2019t killing the regulation. If you don\u2019t kill the regulation, then the possibility is for another president to reinstate some form of Obamacare through that regulatory structure. I\u2019m also concerned, as Sen. Rand Paul has suggested, that the current proposal is, in effect, a de facto continuation of the individual mandate,\u201d Skoda adds. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling people to calm down and be a little bit more strategic,\u201d Bill Hennessy, founder of the St. Louis Tea Party, tells Breitbart News. \u201cDonald Trump is a better negotiator than anyone in Congress,\u201d Hennessy says. \u201cThe establishment thought President Trump was out of his mind when he announced he was running for president. They thought he was out of his mind when he promised to build a wall. One thing President Trump has shown, he always knows what he\u2019s doing when it comes to setting the table for negotiations,\u201d Hennessy concludes. \u201cI started out as \u2018 \u2019 and became a Trump supporter because President Trump kept his word,\u201d Judson Phillips, founder and president of Tea Party Nation tells Breibart News. \u201cPresident Trump promised us there will be a repeal of Obamacare, and I believe he will keep his word on that,\u201d Phillips adds. \u201cWhat Speaker Ryan and the establishment Republicans need to realize is this: they are destroying what little good will they have with the conservative movement. That is a fight they do not wish to have. It is a fight they will end up losing \u201d he says. \u201cThey needed the Tea Party to take the House, take the Senate, and take the White House. If they do what they do best, which is selling out the conservative base, they will find themselves in the minority in the House and in the Senate,\u201d Phillips concludes.'"}, "time": 1742562436.6765506}
