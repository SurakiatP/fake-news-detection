The claim is so far-fetched, it is hardly credible. More credible is that the US is reeling from Putin\u2019s stunning humiliation earlier this week. \\nSince June, US media and supporters of Democrat presidential contender Hillary Clinton have been blaming Russian state-sponsored hackers for breaking into the Democratic party\u2019s database. \\nIt is further alleged that Moscow is stealthily trying to influence the outcome of the election, by releasing damaging information on Clinton, which might favor Republican candidate Donald Trump. \\nRussia has vehemently denied any connection to the cyber-crime charges, or trying to disrupt the November poll. \\nNow the Obama administration has stepped into the fray by openly accusing Russia. \u00abUS government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections\u00bb, reported the Washington Post. \\nThis takes the row to a whole new level. No longer are the insinuations a matter of private, partisan opinion. The US government is officially labelling the Russian state for cyber-crime and political subversion. \\nPredictably, following the latest allegations, there are calls among American lawmakers for ramping up more economic sanctions against Russia. While US intelligence figures are urging for retaliatory cyber-attacks on Russian government facilities. \\nVladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov derided the US claims as \u00abrubbish\u00bb. He noted that the Kremlin\u2019s computer system incurs hundreds of hacking attempts every day, many of which can be traced to American origin, but Moscow doesn\u2019t turn around and blame the US government for such cyber-attacks. \\nThere are several signs that the latest brouhaha out of Washington is a bogus diversion. \\nAs with previous Russian-hacker claims by the Democrats and US media, there is no evidence presented by the Obama administration to support its grave allegations against the Russian government. Assertion without facts does not meet a minimal standard of proof. \\nWhen reports emerged in June \u2013 again through the Washington Post \u2013 that the Democrat National Committee (DNC) was hacked by Russian agents, the allegation relied on investigations by a private cyber security firm by the name of CrowdStrike. The firm is linked by personnel to the NATO-affiliated, anti-Russian think tank Atlantic Council. Again no verifiable evidence was presented then, just the word of a dubious partisan source. \\nBack then the Russian scare story, for that\u2019s what it was, served as a useful diversion from far more important issues. Such as the 19,000 emails released from the DNC database showing that the party chiefs had preordained Clinton\u2019s presidential nomination over her Democrat rival Bernie Sanders. Much-vaunted \u00abUS democracy\u00bb was exposed as a fraud, and so the Washington establishment quickly went into damage-limitation mode by smearing Russia. \\nIt was the whistleblower site Wikileaks, run by Australian journalist Julian Assange, that released the embarrassing emails. It had nothing to do with Russia. Assange has since hinted that his source was within the Democrat party itself. \\nThis is where it gets really explosive. Assange has vowed to release more emails that will prove that Clinton as Secretary of State back in 2011-2012 masterminded the supply of weapons and money to Islamist terror networks in Libya and Syria for the objective of regime change. Furthermore, Assange says that the emails prove that Clinton lied under oath to Congress when she denied in 2013 that she was had any involvement in facilitating arms to the jihadists. \\nAssange has said that Wikileaks is going to publish the incriminating emails on Clinton\u2019s alleged gun-running to terrorists this month. If the evidence stands up, Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury as well as treason in aiding and abetting official terrorist enemies of the US. \\nThe exposure of an American presidential candidate as being involved in state sponsorship of terrorism while serving as a top government official is a powerful incentive for the Obama administration to find a lurid diversion. \\nHence, the latest charges by the US government against Russia as perpetrating cyber-crime and of trying to subvert American democracy. \\nThis is just one more illustration of how irrational and unhinged the US government has become. \\nDay by day, it seems, leads to more damning revelations of Washington\u2019s complicity in illegal wars, covert subversion of foreign states, and systematic collusion with terrorist networks which have inflicted thousands of deaths on American citizens, among many more thousands of other innocent civilians around the world. \\nIn addition to exposure by sources like Wikileaks, much of revelation about US criminality and state-sponsored banditry has emerged from Russia\u2019s principled military intervention in Syria. Russia\u2019s intervention has not only helped salvage the Syrian nation from a foreign conspiracy of covert war for regime change. Russia\u2019s intervention has also brought into clear focus the systematic links between Washington and its terrorist proxy army working on its behalf in Syria. \\nWashington\u2019s mask of moral and legal superiority has been ripped from its face. And what the world is seeing is the vile ugliness beneath. \\nSuch is Washington\u2019s ignominious fall from pretend-grace to its grim, odious reality that Vladimir Putin this week was empowered to speak from the moral high ground. \\nIn announcing Russia\u2019s unilateral suspension of a 2002 accord with the US for the disposal of nuclear-weapon-grade plutonium, Putin went much, much further. He gave Washington a list of ultimatums that included the US ending its trumped-up sanctions against Russia, with financial compensation, as well as the scaling back of NATO forces from Russia\u2019s border. \\nIn other words, the Russian leader was talking truth to American power in a way that megalomaniac Washington, with all its ridiculous delusions of \u00abexceptionalism\u00bb, has never ever heard before. \\nAmerican pretensions of greatness are eroding like a castle built on sand. Washington\u2019s criminal enterprises and specifically the complicity in terrorism for the supreme crime of foreign aggression are being glaringly exposed. \\nAnd now with due contempt, Russia is putting manners on Washington. It must be excruciating the humiliation for the narcissistic American tyrant to be treated with the disrespect that it deserves and which is long overdue. \\nMoreover, the humiliation is not just in the eyes of the world. The American people can see the true ugly nature of their rulers too. When a giant banner declaring \u00abPutin a peacemaker\u00bb was unfurled off Manhattan bridge in New York City this weekend, the popular enthusiasm went viral. \\nWashington is reeling from Putin\u2019s righteous courage to call it out for what it is. The truth-telling is hard to take for this unipolar unicorn. Its deluded myth-making about its own virtues are being stripped bare. \\nWhat\u2019s going on here is a world-class, historic exposure of American power as a nefarious excrescence on humanity. \\nThe reaction is understandable: foaming-at-the-mouth, desperate, hysterical and panicked. Accusing Russia of hacking into the American \u00abdemocratic process\u00bb is a wild attempt to divert from the paramount issues: Washington\u2019s exposed descent into a vile morass of its own making; the emperor is a criminal; the people know it; and a genuine world leader like Vladimir Putin has the temerity to lay it on the line to this has-been.\""}, "time": 1742628425.4428678}
