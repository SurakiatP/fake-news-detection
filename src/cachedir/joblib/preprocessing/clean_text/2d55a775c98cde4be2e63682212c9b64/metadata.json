Most outside experts who examined the posts, by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, said they contained what appeared to be genuine samples of the code  \u2014   though somewhat outdated  \u2014   used in the production of the N. S. A. \u2019s   malware. Most of the code was designed to break through network firewalls and get inside the computer systems of competitors like Russia, China and Iran. That, in turn, allows the N. S. A. to place \u201cimplants\u201d in the system, which can lurk unseen for years and be used to monitor network traffic or enable a debilitating computer attack. According to these experts, the coding resembled a series of \u201cproducts\u201d developed inside the N. S. A. \u2019s highly classified Tailored Access Operations unit, some of which were described in general terms in documents stolen three years ago by Edward J. Snowden, the former N. S. A. contractor now living in Russia. But the code does not appear to have come from Mr. Snowden\u2019s archive, which was mostly composed of PowerPoint files and other documents that described N. S. A. programs. The documents released by Mr. Snowden and his associates contained no actual source code used to break into the networks of foreign powers. Whoever obtained the source code apparently broke into either the   highly compartmentalized computer servers of the N. S. A. or other servers around the world that the agency would have used to store the files. The code that was published on Monday dates to   when, after Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures, the agency shuttered many of its existing servers and moved code to new ones as a security measure. By midday Tuesday Mr. Snowden himself, in a Twitter message from his exile in Moscow, declared that \u201ccircumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility\u201d for publication, which he interpreted as a warning shot to the American government in case it was thinking of imposing sanctions against Russia in the cybertheft of documents from the Democratic National Committee. \u201cWhy did they do it?\u201d Mr. Snowden asked. \u201cNo one knows, but I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack. \u201d Around the same time, WikiLeaks declared that it had a full set of the files  \u2014   it did not say how it had obtained them  \u2014   and would release them all in the future. The \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d had said they would auction them off to the highest bidder. \u201cI think it\u2019s   stuff, repackaged for resale now,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a computer expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \u201cThis is probably some Russian mind game, down to the bogus accent\u201d of some of the messages sent to media organizations by the Shadow Brokers group, delivered in broken English that seemed right out of a bad spy movie. The N. S. A. would say nothing on Tuesday about whether the coding released was real or where it came from. Its public affairs office did not respond to inquiries. \u201cIt certainly feels all real,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a leading authority on   breaches. \u201cThe question is why would someone steal it in 2013 and release it this week? That\u2019s what is making people think this is likely the work of Russian intelligence. \u201d There are other theories, including one that some unknown group was trying to impersonate hackers working for Russian or other intelligence agencies. Impersonation is relatively easy on the internet, and it could take considerable time to determine who is behind the release of the code. The Shadow Brokers first emerged online on Saturday, creating accounts on sites like Twitter and Tumblr and announcing plans for an auction. The group said that \u201cwe give you some Equation Group files free\u201d and that it would auction the best ones. The Equation Group is a code name that Kaspersky Labs, a Russian cybersecurity firm, has given to the N. S. A. While still widely considered the most talented group of   hackers in the world, the N. S. A. is still recovering from Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars reconfiguring and locking down its systems. Mr. Snowden revealed plans, code names and some operations, including against targets like China. The Shadow Brokers disclosures are much more detailed, the actual code and instructions for breaking into foreign systems as of three summers ago. \u201cFrom an operational standpoint, this is not a catastrophic leak,\u201d Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif. wrote on the Lawfare blog on Tuesday. But he added that \u201cthe big picture is a far scarier one. \u201d In the weeks after Mr. Snowden fled Hawaii, landing in Hong Kong before ultimately going to Russia, it appears that someone obtained that source code. That, he suggested, would be an even bigger security breach for the N. S. A. than Mr. Snowden\u2019s departure with his trove of files. However, the fact that the code is dated from 2013 suggests that the hackers\u2019 access was cut off around then, perhaps because the agency imposed new security measures. The attack on the Democratic National Committee has raised questions about whether the Russian government is trying to influence the American election. If so, it is unclear how  \u2014   or whether  \u2014   President Obama will respond. A response could be public or private, and it could involve sanctions, diplomatic warnings or even a counterattack. \u201cThe real problem for us is that the Russians seem to have taken the gloves off in the cyberdomain,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cand we don\u2019t know how to respond. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563764.4657402}
