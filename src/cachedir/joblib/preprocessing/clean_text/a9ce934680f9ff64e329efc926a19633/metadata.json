And my view is, if you can\u2019t run your own house, you certainly can\u2019t run the White House. You can\u2019t do it,\u201d says the First Lady in reference to Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky. \\nWatch: \\nAccording to The Political Insider , the Clinton camp is so concerned over the release of the 8-year-old video clip that their lawyers are sending letters threatening to sue those who air it. \\nOn Monday, cease and desist letters were sent to WFLA-TV in Tampa, Cox Cable in Gainesville, Bright House Cable in Orlando, and WESH-TV in Orlando demanding that the stations stop airing the ad. \\nMake sure to SHARE this video before it is taken down forever!'"}, "time": 1742562181.1702225}
