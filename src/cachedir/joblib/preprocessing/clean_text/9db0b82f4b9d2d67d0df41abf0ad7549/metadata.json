Friatider \u201cIt is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here,\u201d one of the illegals living in Skallberget in Vasteras writes in a letter to the editor in the local newspaper VLT. Vasteras has recently been subjected to a long series of car fires. The submitter tries the young man, who wishes to remain anonymous, explain what the phenomenon is due. He writes that he came to Sweden when he was young and admittedly had \u201cgood potential\u201d but that he was subject to persistent \u201cracism\u201d by the authorities. (What \u201crace\u201d is Islam?) \u201cAlready at an early age became a man treated differently. Sometimes it was because of ethnicity, sometimes because they were at a certain place, and sometimes just to those very people who were in power felt to fuck with us. So many times I had been propped up against the wall and strip-searched in front of my loved ones. It really depressed me and my value, \u201che writes. The man writes that the young people in the area feel \u201coppressed\u201d and that they are burning cars to \u201cget the environment to react and listen.\u201d Among other things, he complains that the objectives of the local football field does not have a network and that it is not organized enough \u201cactivities\u201d for young people. \u201cIn short, it is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here. There is neither good fellowship, activities and things / objects we can make use of.\u201d Submitters have received several responses from readers who are critical of the reasoning. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before someone of obtained or \u2018the others\u2019 die if this continues. No pity you \u2013 all just hate you more and more,\u201d writes , for example, the signature \u201cFormer car owners on Skallberget\u201d. \\nv'"}, "time": 1742564380.2550147}
