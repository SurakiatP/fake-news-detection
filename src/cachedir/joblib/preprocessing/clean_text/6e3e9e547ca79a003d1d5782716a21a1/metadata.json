Mohammed Wazza Paedo November 2, 2016 @ 2:52 am \\nSounds great, but the cynic in me tells me that I\u2019ve heard similar for the the last 3 or 4 years, that this or that is gonna happen to Obama or Clinton etc etc & of course nothing ever did. Seeing is believing. That being said, this time with the release of the latest batch of Criminal Clinton\u2019s, Weiner & Abedin emails, I think this time there\u2019s enough to make the mud stick. Especially now that the Intelligence Community & sections of the FBI are really pissed off. I won\u2019t be holding my breath, but as Sir Winston Churchill once said \u201cA week is a long time in politics\u201d. Dajjal November 2, 2016 @ 4:33 am \\nMoe, there are many pissed off people in the CIA, FBI & Pentagon plus a plethora who were purged, who have scores to settle with Obamination and some of them have the means. \u0111\\x9f\\x99\\x82 We may never know who really tipped off Wikileaks, it may be an inside job. \\nRumor has it the email archive folder on Weiner\u2019s laptop was named \u201clife insurance\u201d. Did Weiner archive those emails for their blackmail value? Did he contemplate triggering a dead man switch? Too many questions, not enough answers.

These are very vile evil people we are dealing with and they will react like a cornered mountain lion. The next few days are going to be interesting.'"}, "time": 1742628435.3924499}
