Memos ordered employees of at least four agencies not to send out news releases or to create social media posts, blog entries or official website content, and to consult with senior officials before speaking to the news media. Such memos or oral communications landed this week at the E. P. A. and the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture and Health and Human Services, in a broad halt to external communications while the Trump administration struggles to put political appointees into position. Small   of communications  \u2014   apparently in dissent  \u2014   appeared on Twitter, but they were quickly stopped. The Twitter posts of the social media division of the Badlands National Park broadcasting the threat of climate change became something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre before they disappeared from the platform on Tuesday. A White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, attributed those Twitter posts to a former park employee who had commandeered the park\u2019s account. Longtime employees at three of the agencies  \u2014   including some career environmental regulators who conceded that they remained worried about what President Trump might do on policy matters  \u2014   said such orders were not much different from those delivered by the Obama administration as it shifted policies from the departing White House of George W. Bush. They called reactions to the agency memos overblown. On Wednesday, Douglas Ericksen, a spokesman for the E. P. A. said that grants had been only briefly frozen for review, and that they would be restarted by Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through many transitions, and I don\u2019t think this is a story,\u201d said a senior E. P. A. career official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media on the matter. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to call it a gag order. This is standard practice. And the move with regard to the grants, when a new administration comes in, you run things by them before you update the website. \u201d But the White House and State Department did delete nearly all mentions of climate change policy  \u2014   which had been a top priority for Mr. Obama  \u2014   and have begun replacing them with pages detailing Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to roll back those policies  \u2014   a top priority for the new president. It is standard practice for new administrations to make changes to their websites to reflect their different policy positions. The full contents of the Obama administration\u2019s White House and State Department websites, including working links to climate change reports, have been archived and are readily available to the public. But environmental advocates and Democrats took advantage of the moves, noting that they appeared to target agencies that focus on environmental protection and scientific research, and calling them a chilling signal that the Trump administration intends to suppress communication about science and environmental policy, and possibly scientific data. If nothing else, the memos and ensuing reaction furthered the impression of turmoil throughout the government as Mr. Trump tries to assert control. Scientists said that even if no climate or other scientific data has been deleted from government websites, they remain fearful that it could be. Mr. Ericksen wrote in an email on Wednesday that the Trump administration team is now \u201creviewing\u201d the E. P. A. \u2019s climate change page for changes. \u201cPeople can\u2019t tell whether data is being purged or not  \u2014   it\u2019s a confused situation,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which supplies scientific reports to world governments. \u201cIf the Trump administration doesn\u2019t want rumor, invective and anxiety running amok, they should get out there and say publicly and firmly that they believe in science and have no intention of hiding science from the public. And they haven\u2019t done that,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer said. Environmentalists also criticized what appeared to be a Twitter war between some Interior Department employees and their new bosses, as the agency appeared to delete Twitter posts by National Park Service employees that highlighted the smaller attendance at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration than at Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration, as well as facts about climate change. Rebellious posts on social media became so plentiful from so many obscure sites that the management of the Interior Department appeared powerless to find them all. The Golden Gate National Park tweeted out concerns over a warming planet. After the Badlands Twitter posts were taken down, employees at the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site in Buffalo ended Tuesday evening by quoting the first President Roosevelt on free speech  \u2014   \u201ca necessity in any country where the people are free. \u201d But it is far from clear how realistic the response has been. The Agriculture Department memo to employees was modeled after one written by Tom Vilsack, President Barack Obama\u2019s agriculture secretary. \u201cIn order for the department to deliver unified, consistent messages, it\u2019s important for the office of the secretary to be consulted on media inquiries and proposed responses to questions related to legislation, budgets,   policy issues and regulations,\u201d wrote Mr. Vilsack, a former Democratic governor of Iowa, in 2009. \u201c  statements should not be made to the press without notifying or consulting with the office of the secretary. \u201d Michael Young, the acting deputy secretary of the Agriculture Department, who has worked as a career civil servant in the department for 33 years, wrote a memo to employees telling them to consult the secretary\u2019s office when responding to news media inquiries, and he said the memo was little different than the one that was issued during the transition to Mr. Obama\u2019s administration. \u201cThis memo is not some sort of creative writing exercise,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is almost exactly what was issued eight years ago. I just updated it a bit. \u201d Asked about the memos at a news briefing on Tuesday, Mr. Spicer said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that when there\u2019s an administration turnover that we\u2019re going to review the policies. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561878.4937458}
