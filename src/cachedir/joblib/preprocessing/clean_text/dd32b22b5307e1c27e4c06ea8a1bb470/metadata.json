[It lists expanding production of domestic energy resources, supporting law enforcement,  the military, and enhancing border security.  \u201cSeveral conservation and government watchdog groups say they\u2019re concerned about the direction the Bureau of Land Management is headed after a draft list of agency priorities under the Trump administration surfaced this week,\u201d Greenwire\u2019s EE News reported on Monday. \u201cThe draft   \u2018BLM Priority Work\u2019 list, first reported on yesterday by EE News, calls for the agency to focus on increasing energy development in suitable areas of the 245 million acres BLM manages (Greenwire, April 10),\u201d EE reported. The document is divided into five sections  \u2014   \u201cMaking America Safe through Energy Independence\u201d \u201cMaking America Great Through Shared Conservation Stewardship\u201d \u201cMaking America Safe  \u2014   Restoring Our Sovereignty\u201d \u201cGetting America Back to Work\u201d and \u201cServing the American Family. \u201d EE gathered statements from environmental activists in response to the leaked document, which it said \u201ccalls on the agency to streamline federal coal, hardrock mining, and oil and gas \u2018leasing and permitting processes. \u2019\u201d \u201cIt also prioritizes streamlining unspecified \u2018processes\u2019 mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as well as \u2018land use planning to support energy and minerals development and other priorities,\u2019 including \u2018   processing for pipelines, transmission lines, and   projects,\u2019\u201d EE reported. Under the \u201cMake America Safe\u201d headline, it calls for BLM taking action to \u201ccoordinate with the Department of Defense to ensure that public lands and resources are available to support the mission of our military\u201d and to \u201cprioritize clearance and approval process to support Southern Border actions. \u201d EE illustrated its report with a photograph of the wall now in place along the U. S. border with Mexico, which Trump has vowed to expand. The document states that BLM will \u201cprovide employment opportunities for veterans and youth to work on public lands. \u201d But critics of Trump\u2019s plans expressed horror after reviewing the document. \u201cThe Trump administration is prioritizing drilling, mining and the construction of an immoral and   border wall over protecting America\u2019s public lands and people\u2019s health,\u201d League of Conservation Voters Deputy Legislative Director Alex Taurel said in a statement given to EE. \u201cOur country\u2019s public lands should be preserved for all people to enjoy and should not be handed over to corporate polluters,\u201d Taurel added. \u201cThe priorities from Trump\u2019s Bureau of Land Management make it clear that the administration is not planning to manage our parks and other special places for the use and enjoyment of the people, but rather for the profits of corporate polluters,\u201d Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s public lands protection campaign, said in a statement provided to EE. \u201cAmerica\u2019s public lands are worth much more than what lies underneath,\u201d Manuel said. \u201cThese are the places where families spend time together, where people and wildlife both can take refuge as they enjoy and explore our wild places. \u201d But EE reported that a senior BLM official \u201cdefended the priority work list, telling EE News this week that it is meant to help agency staff understand that the Trump administration will prioritize the agency\u2019s full \u2018 \u2019 mission  \u2014   including increased public access and recreation  \u2014   and not concentrate solely on promoting fossil fuels or any other energy development. \u201d Under the \u201cServing the American Family,\u201d BLM included in its goals expanding recreational, hunting and wildlife conservation opportunities, working with state and local law enforcement to improve public safety and streamlining grazing permits to help American ranchers and farmers.'"}, "time": 1742563438.013709}
