Trump said in a statement within hours of when Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a gay nightclub and invoked the Islamic State in a 911 call. \u201cFor that reason alone, he should step down. \u201d The next day, Mr. Obama called the focus on phrasing \u201ca political distraction. \u201d \u201cWhat exactly would using this label accomplish?\u201d the president asked. \u201cCalling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. \u201d What does \u201cradical Islam\u201d even mean and why has it become so controversial? Is this argument just semantics, or does it go deeper? Let\u2019s start with the words. \u201cIslam\u201d is a    religion whose 1. 6 billion followers worldwide observe a spectrum of customs and traditions. \u201cRadical\u201d can mean something very different or against tradition, or be defined as extreme views, practices and policies. The words, absent political context, could be read as trying to distinguish fringe interpretations of Islam, including justifications for violence, from the mainstream majority view, which is peaceful. But that context  \u2014   including who shouts the phrase and who studiously avoids uttering it  \u2014   has ladened it with pernicious meaning in particular quarters. Shadi Hamid, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that before the controversy began, he did not use the phrase \u201cradical Islam\u201d much, but neither did he find it overly objectionable. After two years of politicization, though, Mr. Hamid and other analysts say the phrase has worrisome connotations, potentially maligning all Muslims or Islam itself. \u201cWhy would you feel such a need to use this particular combination of words, when the vast majority of us agree that this is terrorism and that it should be stopped or countered?\u201d he asked. \u201cThese terms are being used as dog whistles. \u201d Will McCants, another Brookings scholar, told The Washington Post in December 2015 that \u201cevery bit of that phrase is analytically unhelpful\u201d because of its lack of specificity. \u201cIs this the   Islam of the poets?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe court Islam of the caliph? What kind of Islam are you even talking about?\u201d Republicans who invoke \u201cradical Islam\u201d seem to be trying to telegraph certain arguments about Muslims, political correctness, and the United States\u2019 failure to stop the march of extremist groups across the Middle East. At the same time, Democrats who reject it are also making a political statement, one touching on Islamophobia and inclusiveness. If it seems unlikely that a single phrase with no fixed definition could contain all that information, the fight over \u201cradical Islam\u201d becomes easier to understand when examined in its initial context: as a way to make sense of the rise of the Islamic State. Throughout late 2014, as the group, also known as ISIS and ISIL, conquered much of Iraq in a campaign of shocking violence, Americans struggled to discern what role, if any, religion played in its ideology. Because only 38 percent of Americans personally know someone who is Muslim, according to a 2014 Pew poll, most have little firsthand knowledge to go on. Mr. Obama, then and now, has tried to separate the terrorists from Islam, urging tolerance of Muslims in the United States and abroad. \u201cAnd all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like ISIL somehow represent Islam, because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative,\u201d he said in February 2015. Republicans slammed him for either ignorance or a misplaced sense of political correctness. In part because the president refused to use it, the phrase \u201cradical Islam\u201d became a shorthand for everything he would not say about ISIS, and therefore, a way to accuse him of privileging sensitivity over forthrightness when discussing the threat the group posed. In its simplicity, the phrase reframes the daunting, confusing litany of problems that contribute to terrorism  \u2014   faraway failed states, complex ideologies, a prevalence of guns  \u2014   as something much easier to understand. \u201cWe are at war with radical Islam,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, then a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said after the attacks in Paris last November. He likened Mr. Obama\u2019s avoidance of the phrase to \u201csaying we weren\u2019t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren\u2019t violent themselves. \u201d Over time, the phrase morphed into a way for critics to explain why the Obama administration had failed to anticipate or stop the rise of the Islamic State. \u201cYou cannot fight and win a war on radical Islamic terrorism if you\u2019re unwilling to utter the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,\u2019 \u201d Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, said in January, back when he, too, was clamoring for the White House. Over time, \u201cradical Islam\u201d has taken on darker connotations. Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Hamid of Brookings, \u201cinvested these words with new meaning. \u201d As his campaign of   policy proposals and speech gained traction, Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican rivals sought to match him. Mr. Cruz, for example, urged refusing Syrian refugees if they are Muslim. Ben Carson suggested Muslims should be barred from the presidency. They often invoked \u201cradical Islam\u201d at the same time. The phrase does not explicitly say there is an intrinsic link between terrorism and Islam. But it suggests religion is the core issue, and by using the vague modifier \u201cradical,\u201d there is an implication that any adherent can be suspect on grounds that are unclear and open to interpretation. \u201cTo term something \u2018radical Islamic violence\u2019 condemns a religion,\u201d Steven Cook, a Middle East scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in December, \u201cand leaves one with the erroneous impression that the competing modern interpretations of Islam that specifically refute violent Islamism\u2019s worldview do not exist. \u201d Mr. Obama and others say that condemning \u201cradical Islam\u201d does not make clear who is being condemned. That, they argue, risks exacerbating   sentiment in the United States, which has already grown violent. It also risks alienating Muslims abroad. Washington has long battled a perception in the Muslim world that it is at war with Islam, a perception that can feed   sentiment and politics. At the same time, labeling ISIS \u201cradical Islam,\u201d in some eyes, legitimizes the group\u2019s claims to represent an entire religion, when in fact most of its victims and enemies are themselves Muslim. \u201cIf we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with the broad brush, and imply that we\u2019re at war with an entire religion, then we\u2019re doing the terrorists\u2019 work for them,\u201d Mr. Obama said on Tuesday. Even before Mr. Trump took up the phrase as a mantra, Mr. Obama and others resisted it as part of a larger hesitation to discuss the Islamic State\u2019s use of religion as anything but false and cynical. But it is impossible to understand the Islamic State\u2019s ideology and recruiting power without acknowledging the role of religious beliefs that, while rejected by the overwhelming majority of Muslims, are often earnestly held. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the view that ISIS does have something to do with Islam,\u201d Mr. Hamid said. \u201cWe just have to talk about what that something is and do so in a nuanced, constructive way. \u201d He called it \u201cproblematic\u201d that many Americans, including the president, do not seem \u201ccomfortable speaking about religion as a motivating force or how it inspires violence or extremism, or that religion has a certain kind of power in everyday life in the Middle East. \u201d Hillary Clinton, perhaps in tacit acknowledgment of these concerns, has this week tried to take a middle path. She described the Orlando attack as \u201cradical Islamism\u201d  \u2014   a small but meaningful distinction Islam is a religion, whereas Islamism a political ideology calling for Islamic government. She also declared, \u201cIt matters what we do, not what we say. \u201d When I asked Mr. Hamid this, he countered with a different question. Given how many labels already exist to describe terrorists that draw on Islam, why insist on this one? He listed several  \u2014   \u201cradical jihadists, Salafis, Islamist extremists, jihadis,  \u201d  \u2014   none of which, he said, carry the baggage of \u201cradical Islam. \u201d But if it\u2019s that baggage that repels scholars, it may also be what draws others. \u201cRadical Islam\u201d has come to imply certain things about issues that are closer to home than abstract terrorist ideology: political correctness, migration, and the question of who belongs. Those same issues have animated debates over terrorism and terminology in other societies. In Germany, \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d has become shorthand for larger questions of how to absorb migrants and whether there is a degree of minimum assimilation. There is endless sparring over \u201cBritish values,\u201d and what sort of burden this puts on migrants before they will be welcomed into society. France has had its own parsing of \u201cradical Islam,\u201d though the fight over \u201csecularism\u201d is even fiercer. Even majority Muslim societies have had versions of this same argument, Mr. Hamid pointed out. In Egypt, he said, the struggle over terms is, in part, a way of litigating whether parties like the Muslim Brotherhood are ideologically akin to terror groups  \u2014   and therefore whether they should be allowed to participate in society. What these debates have in common is that arguing about how to define terrorism becomes a way to push and pull the contours of national identity, determining who is invited in to that identity and who is kept out. In every case, the debate is framed as one of pluralism versus security. Pinning terrorism on \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d or   or foreign values or \u201cradical Islam\u201d all portray inclusiveness as somehow threatening and exclusiveness as safer. The question of whether pluralism and security are indeed in tension, or whether pluralism in fact enhances security, is one that people around the world have long grappled with. But it\u2019s hard to discuss because it is so core to national identity. Debating semantics is much easier.'"}, "time": 1742628557.4535584}
