[One reporter suggested during the White House press briefing that by firing Comey, Trump had made it more difficult to work with Democrats to solve other problems in Washington like health care.  \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think it matters what this president says, you\u2019re going to have Democrats come out and fight him every single step of the way,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s wrong with Washington, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019ve got to get back to focusing those issues and frankly draining the swamp a little bit further. \u201d Sanders drew fire from Trump opponents for trying to move beyond the investigation, when so many Democrats were calling for a special independent prosecutor. But she assured reporters that there was still no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite a year\u2019s worth of speculation in the media. \u201cI know that you all will not let this go until it does,\u201d Sanders told reporters. \u201cAnd so we\u2019d love for that to be completed. Let\u2019s put it behind us, let\u2019s move on, and let\u2019s focus on what we need to do to turn our country around. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562740.3769681}
