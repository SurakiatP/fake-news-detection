Maybe you partied hard and had a little too much to drink  \u2014   or maybe a lot too much  \u2014   so you turn to the internet to search for cures to a hangover. To spare you the bleary   research, here\u2019s what you should know before you drink. If you have to ask, count yourself lucky not to have experienced one. Not surprisingly, the more alcohol you consume, the better your chances of getting a hangover. Binge drinking of four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men during any one episode increases the likelihood of a hangover, Laura J. Veach, an associate professor of general surgery at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in   N. C. said in an email. Dr. Veach said a hangover occurs when the concentration of alcohol in one\u2019s system is decreasing. It is at its worst when all the alcohol has been eliminated. \u201cAddiction specialists have often noted that a hangover is technically a form of alcohol withdrawal at its most benign,\u201d she said. The scientific community does not completely understand what causes hangovers, Dr. Preston R. Miller, a surgeon at Wake Forest, said in an email. Alcohol is a diuretic that causes dehydration and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to nausea and dilation of blood vessels, which can cause the headaches associated with hangovers. Unless you are going to abstain or drink in moderation, the answer is no, experts said. Some commercial products promote themselves as surefire remedies but Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said in an interview: \u201cThe bottom line: When you get the hangover, there is nothing clinically proven to make it go away. There is no magic pill. \u201d A detailed survey of medical literature and research in 2005 concluded, \u201cNo compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. \u201d Among the commercial products promoted as cures: IV drips with a blend of saline solution and electrolyte replacement fluid, patches that are said to replenish the vitamins and acids lost when consuming alcohol, and a \u201cnatural dietary supplement,\u201d only one dose of which is required to \u201cprevent\u201d a hangover, its manufacturer says. Dr. Miller said most cures treat the symptoms, such as a headache or dehydration, \u201cbut the only way to truly get over a hangover is time. \u201d Dr. Marc I. Leavey, a primary care physician in Lutherville, Md. who writes a blog, \u201cString of Medical Pearls,\u201d said in an email that the products were \u201cgimmicks\u201d that either relied on a placebo effect or were no more effective than slowly sipping ice chips or an electrolyte sports drink. \u201cAlcohol consumption is a   market,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt would seem logical that attempts to cash in on the inevitable aftermath would spawn any number of products claiming to help, despite the lack of any foundation for those claims. \u201d Dr. Glatter recommended staying away from   liquors such as bourbon and whiskey. They contain more congeners, complex organic molecules that give the liquors their color and taste but also generate more intense hangovers. Better to drink clearer liquors, such as vodka and gin, which have fewer congeners, he said. Once the damage is done, Dr. Reed Caldwell, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, recommended hydrating with water, electrolyte drinks or coconut water, getting proper nutrition and exercise and taking a cool shower. He added that caffeine may help relieve symptoms from poor sleep but it will not reverse the effects of alcohol or a hangover. Before you start drinking, eat some food (it slows the absorption of alcohol) and have something nonalcoholic between drinks. Before bed, take a nonsteroidal pain reliever and drink water, Dr. Glatter said. Hangover cures remain a hotbed of research, he said, adding: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get there. We\u2019re not there yet. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564254.4801793}
