{"duration": 0.7614116668701172, "input_args": {"text": "'The summer light was fading to gold near Red Square as Oliver Stone maneuvered through the lobby bar of a   Moscow hotel last year. He walked past the marble staircase and the grand piano to a table in the back. A group of businessmen in suits lingered nearby. Stone grimaced. \u201cI think we should move,\u201d he said. His producer, Moritz Borman, led the way to another corner. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d Borman asked. Stone didn\u2019t answer. He eyed an older couple slurping soup and kept moving. A moment later, Stone finally settled in by a window, comfortably beyond earshot of the other patrons. Such security precautions had become routine. Ever since Stone decided to make a biopic about Edward Snowden, the American   blower currently holed up in Moscow somewhere, the director  \u2014   who became a Buddhist while making \u201cHeaven  Earth\u201d and sampled a buffet of psychedelic drugs for \u201cThe Doors\u201d  \u2014   had gone all method again. On \u201cSnowden,\u201d he and Borman became so preoccupied with American government surveillance that they had their Los Angeles offices swept for bugs more than once. The director hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. Principal photography wrapped a month earlier, and now Stone had come to Moscow to film Snowden for the movie\u2019s grand finale. He ordered a decaf coffee and began to lay out the events that led him and Borman to be hanging out in Russian hotels, on the lookout for potential spies. \u201cLast January, Moritz calls me,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe says: \u2018You got a call from this fella who represents Mr. Snowden. You\u2019re invited to Moscow. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d The call had come from Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden\u2019s Russian lawyer. In the course of his career, Kucherena has represented Russian oligarchs, film directors, a few pop singers and a state minister. In 2012, he campaigned for Vladimir V. Putin, and soon after Snowden landed in Moscow, Kucherena showed up at Sheremetyevo Airport and offered his services. Then Kucherena wrote a novel about his new client. Titled \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d it follows a National Security Agency leaker named Joshua Cold who is marooned in the airport and the Russian advocate who liberates him. In January 2014, months before the book was published, Kucherena called Borman to see if Stone might like to make it into a Hollywood movie. \u201cAnd I know you from working on, what, three films?\u201d Stone said at the bar. \u201cFive,\u201d Borman said. At the time, Stone and Borman were barely speaking after a   out during the making of \u201cSavages,\u201d a beachy Blake Lively thriller. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our fights,\u201d Stone said. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s German I\u2019m American. \u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cHe calls, and I go: \u2018Oh, [expletive]. Not again,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Stone continued. It wasn\u2019t just about Borman. Stone wanted nothing to do with another political docudrama. He spent two decades trying to get a biopic about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. off the ground, only to see \u201cSelma\u201d get made to critical acclaim. Then there was the My Lai massacre film. Merrill Lynch put up cash, Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an entire village in Thailand. As the economy collapsed in 2008, the financing evaporated. \u201cYou get these scars, and they don\u2019t go away,\u201d Stone said. So Stone was skeptical. But this was Snowden, who   handedly exposed the colossal scale on which the United States had been surveilling its citizens. Plus, the director needed a hit. After early successes like \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cWall Street,\u201d his more recent films didn\u2019t receive the attention he hoped. The Snowden story had all the ingredients of an epic Stone picture: politics, government conspiracy and, at the center of it all, an American patriot who had lost faith. If it panned out, it could be Stone\u2019s millennial   up to \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d the Ron Kovic biopic that won him an Oscar in 1990. But first Stone and Borman had to make sure Kucherena was for real. Borman asked the lawyer to send the book and two   tickets to Moscow. Both arrived the next day. In case they still had doubts, Kucherena\u2019s office gave Borman a number to call. On the other end was an employee of the Russian consulate in San Francisco, who turned out to be a big fan of \u201cThe Life of David Gale,\u201d a film Borman produced. They were issued visas that same week. (Kucherena denies buying   tickets for Stone and Borman or helping expedite their visas.) \u201cWhen that happened,\u201d Borman said, \u201cI thought, O. K. I guess Kucherena can pull the strings. \u201d As   narratives go, Snowden\u2019s is a compelling one. His transformation from a shy and pale   something  \u2014   full of the sort of idealism those years can afford  \u2014   to political dissident made him a hero figure to   establishment liberals who are in the business of storytelling. Raised in a family of federal employees, Snowden grew up near Fort Meade, Md. He enlisted in the Army, went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and became a technology specialist for the N. S. A. By the summer of 2013, he had downloaded thousands of documents, taken off for Hong Kong and asked the journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras to meet him there. The initial revelations were sensational. Not only had the N. S. A. been monitoring the calls, emails and web activity of millions of Americans, but it also had been tapping into the networks of Google, Yahoo and other companies to do so. The Guardian published the leaks, and Greenwald eventually revealed the identity of his source in a video shot by Poitras. Depending on your feelings about national security, the N. S. A. \u2019s actions were either necessary or unconstitutional. The Apple   founder Steve Wozniak called Snowden a hero. Secretary of State John Kerry called him a traitor. Donald Trump called for his execution. As Snowden became a celebrity, a cause and a historical event, the web of people who wanted to take part in it widened. Most had his best interests in mind, but his story also happened to advance agendas that had long needed an appealing spokesperson.   liberties lawyers wanted to represent him. Activist journalists wanted access to him. Publishers rushed out books, including \u201cThe Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World\u2019s Most Wanted Man,\u201d by Luke Harding of The Guardian, and \u201cThe Snowden Operation: Inside the West\u2019s Greatest Intelligence Disaster,\u201d by Edward Lucas of The Economist. Despite promising an \u201cinside\u201d look, neither writer had ever met Snowden. Those with intimate knowledge documented the experience, too. In 2014, Greenwald published \u201cNo Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the N. S. A. and the U. S. Surveillance State,\u201d a dramatic retelling of how Greenwald broke the story. That fall, Poitras released \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d a tense and spooky documentary about a modest and intelligent young man who hid under a blanket when typing on his laptop. (It won the 2015 Oscar for best documentary.) Snowden, meanwhile, ended up in Russia. He had embarked on a trip to Ecuador, but the United States revoked his passport midflight, leaving him stranded in Moscow. For Russia, Snowden was like a bird that flew in through an open window  \u2014   or, as Putin joked, an unwanted Christmas present. But politically speaking, he could be useful. After enduring the United States\u2019 endless lectures about human rights, the Kremlin could suddenly welcome a man who exposed   American hypocrisy. Kucherena entered the picture as Snowden\u2019s lifeline, or at least as someone who could help him navigate Russia\u2019s asylum laws. An experienced lawyer, Kucherena was appointed by Putin to the Public Council, overseeing the Federal Security Service (F. S. B. ). Snowden\u2019s case presented a new opportunity. It took Kucherena a month to negotiate Snowden\u2019s stay and three months to write \u201cTime of the Octopus. \u201d Stone\u2019s first meeting with Kucherena was a disaster. (\u201cI thought he was a gruff bear,\u201d Stone told me.) The director wanted to meet Snowden, but Kucherena said Snowden wouldn\u2019t meet them until they agreed to option \u201cTime of the Octopus. \u201d (Kucherena denies this.) According to Stone and Borman, by the end of a long weekend, they reached a gentlemen\u2019s agreement: Stone would option the novel  \u2014   if Kucherena could provide regular access to his client. I first spoke to Stone in June 2015, after reading that he was in the midst of shooting a film based on Kucherena\u2019s novel. He said he would be traveling to Moscow again that week to shoot Snowden and agreed to let me tag along. A day later, a peeved Borman called me. \u201cYou\u2019ve been disinvited,\u201d he said coolly. During those 24 hours, this magazine had contacted Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, to arrange an interview with his client. Kucherena may be Snowden\u2019s Russian representative, but in the United States, Wizner runs the show. Wizner was furious. Not just because Stone had invited a reporter to Moscow, but because of how it all looked: that Snowden was involved in a Hollywood movie and that the whole production was seemingly brokered by a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. Borman would later tell me that we had waded into the sticky territory of Snowden\u2019s multiple emissaries. \u201cThere are two ways to access him: One is Kucherena and one is Wizner, and it\u2019s completely political,\u201d Borman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political situation that goes way above your head. \u201d When Wizner and I finally got on the phone, he was in   control mode. He told me that Snowden wasn\u2019t profiting from Stone\u2019s film in any way. \u201cOne    rule Ed always had was, I\u2019m not selling my life rights,\u201d Wizner said. Snowden\u2019s participation in a Hollywood movie would only fuel the claims of his critics  \u2014   that he was a narcissist eager to cash in. That said, Stone\u2019s film would be seen by millions of people, which meant it could sway public opinion. \u201cWe were choosing between two bad options,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cHe could have stubbornly stayed completely at arm\u2019s length and had no input whatsoever. Or he could have some input and compromised the arm\u2019  relationship. And I didn\u2019t know how to advise him on that. \u201d According to Wizner, Snowden met with Stone only to make sure that the film told an accurate story. \u201cIt\u2019s been us walking this tightrope between clearly not having any formal connection to the project  \u2014   not deriving any benefit from it  \u2014   and also not wanting to just be completely helpless and, you know, see what Oliver Stone comes up with,\u201d Wizner said. Despite some initial discomfort, he was tentatively optimistic. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Wizner added. \u201cYou know, Oliver Stone wrote \u2018Scarface. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Still, Stone was heading to Moscow to film Snowden for an appearance in the movie, which could be seen as an endorsement.   checking is one thing, I said a cameo is another. \u201cIt is, and I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with it,\u201d Wizner said. Wizner had negotiated veto control over any footage featuring Snowden in the film. After we spoke, the lawyer says he asked Borman to put that in writing. He also reiterated that if Stone took a reporter along, Snowden would not participate. Stone and I eventually reached a compromise: I wouldn\u2019t observe the shoot, but I could still come and meet Kucherena. A few days later, I met Stone in Moscow. The director, who is 69, has a   leaning gait and unruly eyebrows, so that he looks a bit like a bull that is always about to charge. He emerged from the hotel\u2019s elevator with a pained look on his face. It was drizzling, and Stone\u2019s hair, which is the color of dark shoe polish, was pointing laterally. \u201cI have some bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot deliver Anatoly. \u201d He had just seen Snowden, who had been in touch with Wizner and was very upset, Stone said. \u201cEd said he doesn\u2019t want Anatoly talking to you, and he said that very clearly,\u201d Stone added. I would spend the next few days camped out at the hotel. When Stone wasn\u2019t shooting, we would meet in the lobby bar as he continued to tell me about the making of his film. Soon after optioning Kucherena\u2019s novel, Stone had returned to Moscow with his   writer, Kieran Fitzgerald, a recent University of Texas M. F. A. graduate. Anticipating a homesick Snowden, Fitzgerald hauled over a duffel bag packed with the stuff of Americana dreams: Kraft macaroni and cheese,    cups, Oreos, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Twizzlers, peanut butter, Spam, an Orioles baseball cap and a pair of Converse sneakers. \u201cIt was like delivering a care package to a kid at summer camp,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. He also slipped in a copy of \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d translated by his grandfather, Robert Fitzgerald. \u201cI thought it was appropriate, since Ed was on his own kind of odyssey trying to get home. \u201d Snowden and Stone had gotten off to a slow start. Snowden was squeamish about a movie being made about his life. Stone, in turn, said the film would be made with or without him. Fitzgerald says he played referee. \u201cOliver can be a bit of battering ram,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cHe\u2019s accustomed to hard men who need to be cracked, but that\u2019s not Edward Snowden. He\u2019s not an   male type. He\u2019s a very sensitive mind. So I was there to say: \u2018Everything is going to be O. K. He\u2019s a good guy. It\u2019s going to be a good movie. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Eventually, Snowden began to open up, answering questions about his childhood his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills and what he could about his work for the N. S. A. While Fitzgerald returned to Austin to work on the script, Stone set out to plant his flag in the Snowden story. In Hollywood, book options are the equivalent of calling dibs, and Stone had competition. In May 2014, Sony Pictures optioned Greenwald\u2019s \u201cNo Place to Hide. \u201d By June, Stone had announced that he acquired Kucherena\u2019s book and Harding\u2019s \u201cThe Snowden Files. \u201d The tactic worked. Sony got nervous. \u201cNow what?\u201d Amy Pascal, then Sony\u2019s   chairwoman, wrote to another executive. (The email would be leaked during the Sony hack.) Pascal\u2019s colleague reminded her of the case of the dual Steve Jobs biopics  \u2014   \u201cJobs,\u201d with Ashton Kutcher, might have come out first, but it was \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d starring Michael Fassbender, that was the better film. Pascal wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cOliver Stone is not Ashton Kutcher,\u201d she responded. She wrote to George Clooney to pique his interest in adapting Greenwald\u2019s book, but Clooney passed. \u201cStone will do a hatchet job on the movie, but it will still be the film of Snowden,\u201d he replied. For Stone, the impending Sony project was a call to arms. Fitzgerald cranked out a first draft of the script, and that fall Stone went out to studios with a budget of $50 million and a release date in December 2015. Each one turned it down, and Stone became convinced that the studios wanted to quash the project because of its controversial subject matter. \u201cThis is why corporations owning movie studios is not a good idea,\u201d he said. While Borman hustled to find independent financing, Stone dove into casting. For the lead, he chose Joseph   Levitt, the son of liberals from Sherman Oaks, Calif. and a former child actor who has retained a pleasingly boyish look. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting blandness to him in the same way that Jimmy Stewart might\u2019ve been considered bland,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThere\u2019s a neutrality there, which allows him to grow on you. \u201d Shailene Woodley was cast to play Lindsay Mills, Zachary Quinto as Greenwald and Melissa Leo as Poitras. By early 2015, Borman and Stone had racked up several hundred thousand dollars in debt, but the money was still short. The shoot was ultimately delayed three weeks as the producer cobbled together European partners. In the United States, \u201cSnowden\u201d was picked up by Open Road Films, a small production company that had just put out \u201cJobs\u201d  \u2014   the Kutcher version. \u201cIt was painful that we ended up with this independent distributor,\u201d Stone said. Borman offered that Open Road was not so independent anymore. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of it,\u201d Stone said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve been there before, but not on this level and not at this age. So for me, it was very difficult personally. \u201d The cover of \u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d features a   image of Snowden\u2019s face and a globe peeled like an orange to reveal the logo of the C. I. A. In his author photo, Kucherena indeed looks bearish, with a round face, matted white hair and a cellphone pressed to his right ear  \u2014   as if he were midnegotiation. \u201cThe whole truth about the American agent on the run,\u201d the cover boasts. Also: \u201cOliver Stone is currently shooting a film based on this book. \u201d I had gotten my copy from Stone, who handed it to me with a disclaimer. \u201cNow, it\u2019s easy to take a shot at this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it wasn\u2019t the basis of the movie. But it\u2019s fun. I enjoyed reading it. \u201d \u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d takes place in a single night. The protagonist, Joshua Cold, is sequestered in a bunker at Sheremetyevo Airport, where his Russian lawyer keeps him company. The chapters alternate between their   stamped conversations and those labeled as digital files (\u201cFile 004. wav\u201d) suggesting that they are the lawyer\u2019s transcribed recordings. The basic facts of Cold\u2019s case sound familiar, as do the character names: There are journalists named Boitras and Greywold and an organization called Mikileaks run by an Augusto Cassangie. For the most part, Cold and the lawyer sit and talk about life, quoting Laozi to each other. But there is also a distinctly   Soviet tone to the novel, which reads both like a love letter to American culture  \u2014   Steven Spielberg, B. B. King, \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d Penthouse magazine, Popeye, \u201cThe  \u201d Paul Newman, Bon Jovi, \u201c  Man,\u201d \u201cBraveheart,\u201d Quentin Tarantino and Tupac Shakur are all mentioned  \u2014   and a gleeful taunt to its government. \u201cNot only did [Cold] snap the beak of the American eagle,\u201d Kucherena writes, \u201cbut he also gave him a good kick and a very humiliating one, as if it was not a menacing predator but a rural hen. \u201d In the bunker, Cold enjoys pizza and whiskey, but he is worried about American agents coming to retrieve him. \u201cBelieve me, Russia is not the worst option for you,\u201d the lawyer tells Cold. \u201cAnd you needn\u2019t regard us with such mistrust. \u201d Once Cold is granted asylum, the propaganda is dialed up. \u201cI shall work in Russia and get an apartment!\u201d Cold announces. \u201cI thought I would spend the rest of my life in this underground prison. \u201d \u201cAs far as I know Mr. Putin, he is not one to change his mind easily,\u201d the lawyer assures him. \u201cAll will be O. K. \u201d The novel concludes with Cold vowing to learn to drink like the Russians, but the lawyer suggests he try Kvass instead, a fermented beverage made from rye bread. (\u201cIt is the Russian   Cola,\u201d the lawyer says.) Then they leave the bunker. \u201cWeird, huh?\u201d Fitzgerald said when I asked about the novel. In fact, few people associated with either Snowden or \u201cSnowden\u201d wanted to discuss it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything on the record about that book,\u201d   Levitt told me. According to WikiLeaks, Stone paid a million dollars for \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d which seemed like a hefty amount to pay for material that Stone admitted he had no plans of using. (That\u2019s the same figure Sony reportedly paid for the rights to \u201cEat, Pray, Love. \u201d) \u201cWe bought it because we did get good access to Ed,\u201d Stone explained. \u201cHe had to be brought along. \u201d During Stone\u2019s visits, Kucherena hosted the director at his favorite restaurants and at his dacha outside Moscow. \u201cThey had a kind of bromance,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. Photos from the trips look like vacation postcards, with Stone and Fitzgerald grinning in Red Army caps (a gift from Kucherena) and Fitzgerald and   Levitt posing for a selfie in front of St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral. While out in public, the group referred to Snowden as \u201cSasha,\u201d a nickname Kucherena had given him. Kucherena and I would eventually speak by phone. He said he wrote the novel because he had received calls from many \u201crepresentatives of Hollywood,\u201d writers and filmmakers. \u201cAt some point, I just thought to myself, Why don\u2019t I try to write the book?\u201d he said. I asked which writers and directors had called him. \u201cVery many people called me,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I honestly don\u2019t remember their names now. \u201d The lawyer was deeply troubled by the news media\u2019s insinuations that he is connected to the Kremlin. He pointed to several clients he has defended against the F. S. B. including Platon Obukhov, a writer accused of spying for Britain. \u201cI never had any kind of agreement with the Kremlin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tried to say I\u2019m tied to the F. S. B. but that\u2019s complete nonsense, excuse me. \u201d Kucherena said he was inspired by his favorite authors, who include Tom Clancy, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. \u201cThe Octopus in my novel is, you can say, a direct offspring of Big Brother,\u201d he said. Like most writers of fiction, he was reluctant to discuss which parts of his book were based in reality. \u201cA person can only be open with someone he trusts,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cAnd here, because he had no one else, it turned out that I took on the role of mother and father. Accordingly, we had confidential conversations of various sorts. \u201d He did not see a conflict of interest in his writing the novel. \u201cI wrote an artistic book,\u201d Kucherena said. Because he represents Snowden pro bono, he never expected to capitalize on the relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t take any money from him,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any. So I wrote a book, yes, fine. So I got a little, as we say in Russian. \u201d Despite being the one to put the \u201cSnowden\u201d project into motion, Kucherena shied away from assuming any credit. \u201cI\u2019m very far from all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just an advocate. Look at where I am and where Hollywood is!\u201d When I told Wizner that Stone said he bought Kucherena\u2019s book to gain access to Snowden, his voice climbed a few octaves again. \u201cVirtually every single other person who\u2019s met with Snowden, and there have been dozens of them, have just gone through me, and we\u2019ve hooked it up,\u201d Wizner said. He listed some names, which included the film director Doug Liman, as well as the actors Jared Leto and John Cusack. (Cusack took Snowden Cool Ranch Doritos, as well as DVDs of \u201cNetwork\u201d and \u201cDr. Strangelove. \u201d) Wizner, who is 45, has been at the A. C. L. U. since 2001. Before Snowden, he tried to bring several suits to increase oversight over the intelligence community. Wizner likes to say that he spent a decade banging his head against a wall, and then Snowden came along and brought that wall down. Snowden had not only revealed the scope of the surveillance apparatus, but also that top government officials routinely misled the public about it. Since becoming Snowden\u2019s advocate, Wizner has become a figure of not insignificant geopolitical importance. Those revelations have since formed a critical backdrop for legislative reforms, and there are few things that irritate Wizner more than claims that threaten to tarnish Snowden\u2019s character and their common cause. It would not be a stretch to say that for Wizner, Kucherena has become a bit of a liability. Since 2013, the Russian lawyer has announced that Snowden landed a job at a major Russian website  \u2014   news that turned out to not be true  \u2014   and has supplied the news media with photos of his client enjoying his new life in Russia, attending an opera at the Bolshoi Theater and cheerfully hugging a dog named Rick. (Rick later turned out to be the dog of one of Kucherena\u2019s friends.) Now Kucherena had sold a novel to Stone, making it seem as if the director had to pay a Russian fixer to have access to Snowden  \u2014   or worse, that Snowden was somehow under the lock and key of the Russian authorities, lent to Stone for a Hollywood movie. Wizner\u2019s counterefforts in the United States have been successful. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, once a fierce critic, has acknowledged that Snowden performed \u201ca public service. \u201d President Obama has called for the reform of phone metadata collection, and last June, Congress passed the U. S. A. Freedom Act, a law that directly resulted from Snowden\u2019s leaks. Snowden has come to be seen as a levelheaded activist. According to Wizner, he leads a free existence in Russia, making appearances via live video and publishing   against Russia\u2019s human rights violations. \u201cI think people are inclined to believe that Russia would never let him stay there unless he was paying for it in some way,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not true. Not only is he not cooperating, but he\u2019s actually being critical. \u201d When I asked Wizner about Kucherena\u2019s book, we were meeting at a cafe near his office in Lower Manhattan. \u201cMaybe you should just characterize my facial expression  \u2014   \u2018He smirked,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Wizner said. (Except that his smirk was mixed with a frown.) According to him, Snowden has not read Kucherena\u2019s book. \u201cThe thing is, Ed has much bigger fish to fry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had people calling for your assassination, you\u2019d be annoyed. If you were facing life in solitary confinement, you\u2019d be concerned. If someone wrote some book in Russia that no one is going to read, it doesn\u2019t register. \u201d Wizner was reluctant to discuss Kucherena\u2019s role in Snowden\u2019s life, but he conceded that it was somewhat unorthodox. \u201cIt seems like the ethical rules governing the   client relationship may be somewhat different in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very unusual for a lawyer in a   profile case to provide exclusive photos of his client to newspapers or write an unauthorized book and sell it to Hollywood. \u201d Kucherena and Wizner have never met. Whatever uneasiness there may be, Kucherena spoke warmly about his American counterpart. \u201cWe are on the same team!\u201d he told me. \u201cBen works in America, I work in Russia. If he wanted to write a book, I would have no problem. \u201d Wizner told me he has no plans to write a book about Snowden, fictional or otherwise. \u201cMission accomplished,\u201d Stone announced. We had met in the lobby bar again, the day after he filmed Snowden, and the director was in better spirits. The shoot took place at Kucherena\u2019s dacha. The day went long. Stone\u2019s idea was to interview Snowden and capture an affecting moment that would give the film its dramatic ending. But the first takes were stiff. \u201cEd is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBut I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him. \u201d Stone ended up doing nine takes. At one point, they took a break and went for a walk around Kucherena\u2019s property. By the end of the day, Stone decided that he had gotten Snowden to go as far as he was going to. \u201cHe was cooperative,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe wanted to make it work. But as an actor  \u2014   he\u2019s not used to that. I mean, he\u2019s not an actor. And I don\u2019t think he became one that day. \u201d To make Snowden more comfortable, Stone worked with a minimal crew. Some were meeting the   blower for the first time and still seemed a bit  . \u201cSuddenly this little creature comes teetering in  \u2014   so fragile, so lovely, such a charming,   behaved, beautiful little man,\u201d the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s like an old soul in a very young body. He\u2019s got fingers like violins. \u201d Filming Snowden reminded Mantle of shooting other men with outsize reputations and slight builds. \u201cIt\u2019s like Bono or Al Pacino,\u201d he added. \u201cThose guys are   weenies. But if you isolate him into a frame, he can be as big as anybody else. \u201d Mantle shot Danny Boyle\u2019s \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201c127 Hours,\u201d but \u201cSnowden\u201d proved to be a special challenge. Convinced that making the film on American soil would be too risky, Stone decided to film in Germany, where Borman was able to score some tax subsidies. With roughly 140 script pages to shoot in 54 days, the crew sprinted from Munich to Washington, to Hawaii, to Hong Kong, and then back to Munich. Often, Mantle wouldn\u2019t get to see locations before he had to film in them. To cut costs, the suburbs of Munich had to stand in for rural Maryland and Virginia, with German extras cast as Americans. \u201cThank God the Germans act like Americans,\u201d Stone said. The production itself resembled a covert operation, with a code name (\u201cSasha\u201d had stuck) and elaborate security protocols. Worried that \u201cSasha\u201d would be of interest to the N. S. A. Borman and Stone avoided discussing production details by phone or email  \u2014   \u201cIt was all handwritten notes and long walks in the park,\u201d Borman said  \u2014   and kept the script on   gapped computers, ones that have never been connected to the internet. If it had to be mailed, Borman would mix up the pages into four packages, which he would send with four different couriers to four different addresses. \u201cMaybe nobody gave a [expletive],\u201d Borman told me. \u201cOr maybe the N. S. A. is laughing at us like, \u2018Look at those idiots  \u2014   of course we copied everything that came through DHL and FedEx!\u201d For the actors, the frenetic schedule and paranoia on set added to the mood of the production. \u201cSnowden himself was in the midst of a stressful situation, so the fact that our shoot was a little bit that way, I think, helped,\u201d   Levitt said, before catching himself. \u201cMaking the movie was obviously a walk in the park compared to what he did. But just to have those little emotional touch points can help when you\u2019re acting. \u201d Committed to inhabiting Snowden\u2019s robotic speech pattern,   Levitt lifted the audio from \u201cCitizenfour\u201d and played it on repeat while he slept. He also worried that some of the dialogue felt   handed. \u201cOliver is very into making his point,\u201d the actor said, \u201cas he should be. I really admire him for that. But I felt like it was my job to be like, \u2018O. K. I want to make the point, too, but this is a human being and not just a mouthpiece. \u201d Stone found   Levitt\u2019s approach too \u201c  ish\u201d at times. \u201cI was trying for the dramatic side as much as possible,\u201d Stone said. Fitzgerald was ultimately flown in to the set to execute   minute rewrites. By late spring of 2015, Stone was close to wrapping when his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone, died at 93. She had called him in Munich, but Stone felt he couldn\u2019t risk leaving. \u201cTo go to L. A. would have cost us three down days,\u201d Stone told me. \u201cI knew she was going to pass, but I thought I could make it. \u201d Stone remained on set during the funeral and kept shooting. Stone\u2019s trip to Moscow to film the real Snowden was the last bit he needed to complete the film. But he was still worried  \u2014   that the footage would be leaked, that critics would eviscerate it, that Snowden wouldn\u2019t like it. \u201cI want him to vet it,\u201d he said. He was heading to New York to begin editing and planned to return to Moscow at the end of the summer to show Snowden a rough cut. \u201cO. K. my dear,\u201d Stone said, getting up to leave. \u201cSee you in New York. \u201d Then he disappeared for six months. Before Stone set out to make his film, he had met Snowden\u2019s chief biographers, Greenwald and Poitras. Stone and Greenwald became friendly, and when Greenwald\u2019s book drew interest in Hollywood before it was published, the journalist turned to Stone for advice. \u201cIn the back of my mind, I thought if he had any interest in making a film, that would be a good segue for him to say so,\u201d Greenwald told me. At the time, Stone wasn\u2019t interested, and Greenwald negotiated the deal with Sony. Stone later came back and offered to match Sony\u2019s bid, but Greenwald declined. \u201cI think he was a little perturbed,\u201d Greenwald said. Of the principal cast, Zachary Quinto, who plays Greenwald in Stone\u2019s movie, was the only actor who didn\u2019t meet his   counterpart as research. \u201cI always thought that was a little weird,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cI think Oliver thought I had some competitive hostility toward his project, or he had some hostility  \u2014   I\u2019m not really sure. \u201d (According to Stone, Quinto didn\u2019t need to meet Greenwald because there were so many videos of the journalist online.) In the spring of 2014, Stone flew to Berlin and met with Poitras. The meeting did not go well. According to Poitras, Stone proposed that she delay the release of \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d which she was then in the middle of editing, to time up with his film. \u201cBecause his film would be the real movie  \u2014   because it\u2019s a Hollywood movie,\u201d Poitras told me. \u201cObviously I wasn\u2019t interested in doing that. To have another filmmaker ask me to delay the release of my film was  \u2014   well, it was somewhat insulting. \u201d Stone was annoyed, but he stuck around for a few drinks. They discussed new movies, including \u201c12 Years a Slave. \u201d As Poitras recalls, Stone found the film too violent, while Poitras thought the brutality was appropriate given the subject matter. Stone was growing increasingly frustrated. \u201cAt some point, he reached over and had his hands around my neck,\u201d Poitras said. \u201cIt was sort of in a joking way. I think he was a little bit drunk. But it was not a particularly pleasant evening. \u201d According to Stone, he only offered to help Poitras get distribution. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d help her either bring out her film with our film, or in the wake of it or before it, if we could,\u201d Stone said. He didn\u2019t recall pretending to strangle Poitras. \u201cI think from talking to her, you sense she\u2019s superparanoid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I liked her,\u201d he continued. \u201cI admired her. I saw her films. I was trying to help her. If Laura is accusing me of trying to aggress her or kill her, she\u2019s crazy. \u201d Despite his occasional bullishness, Stone craves approval. His films tend to resemble his character: at once original, impetuous, dogmatic and stubbornly ambitious. They typically run up to three hours, and he is often hurt when they\u2019re underappreciated. Once, I was with Stone when he was handed a copy of \u201cA Child\u2019s Night Dream,\u201d the novel he wrote at 19. Stone began to recite the blurbs aloud. \u201cThe language moves in torrents, always energized . .. shamanistic,\u201d Stone read, quoting The Boston Globe. \u201cI don\u2019t get many good reviews, but this is good. \u201d I said that he has gotten plenty of good reviews since then. \u201cYou should see Rotten Tomatoes,\u201d he said, referring to the   review aggregator. Stone\u2019s torment is at least in part   inflicted. Biopics can be a nasty business, and Stone routinely throws himself into historical narratives and the messy negotiation between fact and fiction. The haggling with historians and family estates is the reason Stone was never able to make films about Martin Luther King Jr. and Hank Williams, and it was why he had to wait for Richard M. Nixon to die to make \u201cNixon. \u201d For Stone, the   characters of the stories he is after have become both the obstacles and the necessary arbiters of his work. It\u2019s why he refused to make \u201cSnowden\u201d without Snowden, and why his appeals to Greenwald and Poitras were his way of getting them on board. If Poitras had a strong reaction to Stone\u2019s proposal, it was because she had already been hounded by Sony. After the studio optioned Greenwald\u2019s book, Poitras says Sony asked to buy her life rights  \u2014   an offer she declined. Sony suggested that she come on as a consultant, but when the contract arrived, it stipulated that the studio would have access to Poitras\u2019s tapes and notebooks. \u201cSo I\u2019d already gone through that when Oliver came in trying to position himself,\u201d she said. Poitras is a   spoken, cautious woman who has spent much of the past decade on government watch lists. Her resistance to participating in various Snowden projects has less to do with her feeling territorial than with her trying to maintain some control as she has become a character in a story that is no longer hers. Poitras\u2019s radical position is that the \u201cSnowden story\u201d can really belong only to Snowden. \u201cI could have asked him for a   contract in Hong Kong, but I don\u2019t believe in that as a concept,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s his story, and I hope he tells it when he\u2019s ready. \u201d Neither Greenwald nor Poitras ultimately object to Stone making his film. While his own movie still lingered in development, Greenwald thought Snowden\u2019s story might in fact be safer in Stone\u2019s hands than it would be elsewhere. The Sony leaks would eventually reveal that Stone\u2019s paranoia may have been justified: In emails about the purchase of Greenwald\u2019s book, an executive in Sony\u2019s   affairs office suggests toning down the news release, changing \u201cillegal spying\u201d to \u201cintelligence gathering\u201d and \u201cmisuse of power\u201d to \u201cactions. \u201d \u201cMy big worry with Hollywood and the Snowden story is that they\u2019re either going to be cowards and completely drain it of its political vitality,\u201d Greenwald told me, \u201cor that they\u2019re going to do a superbiased smear job. For all the talk about how liberal Hollywood is, the reality is that they\u2019re really close to the government. And whatever other things you might say about Oliver, I was actually relieved that someone was going to do this film where there was no danger of those things happening. \u201d This January, I drove to Stone\u2019s office in West Los Angeles to watch a rough cut of \u201cSnowden. \u201d Stone works out of a discreet suite in a pristine office complex. The d\u00e9cor is eclectic. There are tribal masks, Indonesian throw pillows, a Che Guevara painting and a lone potted palm tree. Like \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d \u201cSnowden\u201d takes place in Hong Kong, but this time the story has the eerie feeling of a familiar scene   enacted by skilled Hollywood actors. Stone was right about   Levitt. His performance is not an interpretation so much as a direct replica of the   blower\u2019s even demeanor and intonation. Quinto plays Greenwald with such intensity that he appears perpetually enraged. Melissa Leo\u2019s Poitras is in turn warm and protective, almost maternal. Stone came in just as the credits rolled. He was nursing a cold but was back on caffeine and asked his assistant for Bulletproof, the trendy coffee brand made with \u201c  butter. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be nutritional,\u201d Stone said. \u201cNo radicals. \u201d Since I last saw him, the film\u2019s release had been pushed from December 2015 to May 2016 as Stone rushed to complete it, and then once more to September 2016. The biggest challenge was pacing. Stone likes to structure his movies around a series of   pivoting, battlelike scenes  \u2014   the concerts in \u201cThe Doors,\u201d the football games in \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d or actual warfare in \u201cAlexander. \u201d A story in which the drama hinges on a tech specialist downloading classified documents was more subdued than he was accustomed to. \u201cCoding is not exciting,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a nerdlike behavior  \u2014   it\u2019s dull on a screen. \u201d Stone got around the tedium of reality by turning his film into a cross between a cyberthriller and a love story, using Snowden\u2019s relationship with Mills to inject emotional stakes. Cutting between Snowden in Hong Kong and flashbacks to his past, the film speeds through Snowden\u2019s biography with the help of techno music, snappy explanations of N. S. A. programs and tricky camerawork to build in the tension of surveillance. (There are scenes filmed from the perspective of tiny phone cameras  \u2014   the modern peephole  \u2014   and suggestive   on eye pupils.) But there are also unmistakable  . \u201cI just don\u2019t really like bashing my country,\u201d   Levitt says to Woodley as they stroll past a   era antiwar protest in front of the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s my country, too,\u201d Woodley says. \u201cAnd right now, it\u2019s got blood on its hands. \u201d Snowden\u2019s N. S. A. boss is unsubtly named Corbin O\u2019Brian, after the antagonist in Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984. \u201d \u201cMost Americans don\u2019t want freedom,\u201d O\u2019Brian tells Snowden. \u201cThey want security. \u201d Snowden\u2019s many storytellers all tell a similar hero narrative. But if Greenwald\u2019s account is about journalism, Poitras\u2019s is a subtle and artful character study and Kucherena\u2019s is an attempt at the Russian novel  \u2014   a man alone in a room, wrestling with his conscience  \u2014   Stone\u2019s is the explicit blockbuster version, told in high gloss with big, emotional music and digestible plot points that will appeal to mass audiences. As Wizner wisely anticipated, it is the narrative most likely to cement Snowden\u2019s story in Americans\u2019 minds. Snowden declined to comment for this article, but Stone told me he had seen the film and liked it. At a screening at   Con a few months later, Snowden would beam in via satellite to give his somewhat wary approval. \u201cIt was something that made me really nervous,\u201d he said of Stone\u2019s film. \u201cBut I think he made it work. \u201d As Stone intended, Snowden shows up at the end of the film. He appears in a   paneled room in Kucherena\u2019s dacha, a modest,   looking space, with little to see except a vase of flowers and some curtains in the background. The Snowden who speaks is not the stoic version, but one who manages to deliver a   caliber movie line. \u201cI no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve done today. \u201d Just before the screen fades to black, Snowden is shown gazing toward a window, a faint, inscrutable smile on his face. By this summer, whatever anxieties there may have once been seemed to have dissipated. With the film completed, Stone would officially beat Sony\u2019s project. Open Road, the distributor he was worried about, had won an Oscar for \u201cSpotlight. \u201d After \u201cSnowden\u201d earned similar marks to that film during test screenings, everyone seemed optimistic, if a little surprised. \u201cAt first I thought there must be something wrong,\u201d said Borman, who told me that he hadn\u2019t seen such high scores in 25 years. Open Road had pushed for a fall release, placing it firmly among Oscar contenders. (\u201cSnowden\u201d will open in theaters on Sept. 16, the day after Stone\u2019s 70th birthday.)   Levitt was so moved by Snowden\u2019s story that he donated most of his salary from the film to the A. C. L. U. and used the rest to collaborate with Wizner on a series of videos about democracy. Wizner was preparing to petition Obama to grant Snowden a presidential pardon in the fall, and he hoped Stone\u2019s film would help transform the public\u2019s perception of his client. Kucherena, meanwhile, had turned \u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d into a trilogy  \u2014   in the sequel, the N. S. A. sends an assassin to Russia to \u201celiminate\u201d Joshua Cold. He hoped to come to the United States for the premiere of the film, in which he has a cameo as a Russian banker who encounters Snowden at a party. \u201cIf I can get a visa, why not?\u201d he said. In July, Stone and Wizner joined forces for an A. C. L. U. event. The evening was billed as a conversation with Wizner about surveillance and Edward Snowden, with Stone hosting at his   style home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. As several dozen West Coast supporters of the A. C. L. U. filtered into Stone\u2019s backyard, the director sat camped out on a bench by the pool, taking the party in from a distance. He boasted that he had recently cut four more minutes from the film, bringing the run time to a lean 134 minutes. I asked if he would keep finessing until the end. \u201cNo, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is it. Now I die. \u201d Wizner roamed around, inspecting a meditation gazebo outfitted with a large gold Buddha. After several people inquired who was playing him in the movie, the lawyer came up with a pithy reply. \u201cKevin Spacey, reprising his role as Keyser Soze,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe guy behind the guy behind the guy  \u2014   hiding in plain sight. \u201d (Wizner is not a character in Stone\u2019s film.) That week, NPR ran an interview with a Russian security official who posited that Snowden is maybe, probably, most definitely cooperating with Russian intelligence. This inevitably set Wizner off. \u201cOf course, this is the same week that Snowden is blasting Putin on Twitter every day,\u201d Wizner said to Borman, who nodded along. The producer suggested that Snowden\u2019s critics would claim it\u2019s a cover. \u201cThat\u2019s what they say!\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThis is preapproved criticism so that it\u2019ll seem like he\u2019s free, but actually Putin is the master pulling the strings. \u201d Eventually, everyone moved to the den, a spacious, brightly lit room filled with family photos. Matthew Weiner, the \u201cMad Men\u201d creator, took a seat by a stack of DVDs, which included multiple seasons of his own hit TV show. Others arranged themselves along wicker chairs that lined the room\u2019s perimeter. The whole thing had the feeling of a P. T. A. meeting, but without the stale cookies. Wizner got up and spoke for some time about his efforts as Snowden\u2019s lawyer. As he opened the room to questions, someone asked how long Russia could be relied on to keep Snowden safe. Wizner turned the question over to Stone. \u201cOliver is the Russia expert,\u201d he said with a hint of   aggression. Since completing \u201cSnowden,\u201d Stone had become absorbed in his newfound interest in Russia and announced that he was making a documentary about Putin. In recent months, he had accompanied the Russian president to a theater performance and a World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. \u201cHe represents a different point of view that Americans don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Stone had told RIA Novosti, a Russian news service. When someone else asked about Stone\u2019s experience of making \u201cSnowden,\u201d his answer was despondent. \u201cIt was really a horrible experience in every way,\u201d he said. Everyone laughed except for Stone. As the guests dispersed, Wizner lingered in the foyer, admiring Stone\u2019s art collection depicting important and mostly dead men. He thought that a print of   Sartre looked like Steve Buscemi and that a   looking Beethoven was actually Stone. On the opposite wall was a sketch of Genghis Khan, the feared Mongolian emperor. Stone called him a liberal. \u201cYes, Genghis Khan  \u2014   misunderstood,\u201d Wizner teased. Stone smiled and cocked his head. \u201cListen, the A. C. L. U. should defend him!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561691.7896042}
