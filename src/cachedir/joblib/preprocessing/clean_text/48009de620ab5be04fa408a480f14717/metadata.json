Progressives Push Candidates, Issues Up and Down Political Ladder   Steven Rosenfeld / AlterNet Jason Morrison / CC BY-NC 2.0 \\nAs the 2016 election closes, progressives are on the frontline of the latest rallying cry by Democrats Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine, President Obama and the rest of the party\u2019s leaders to sweep Republicans out of office up and down the political ladder.It\u2019s no secret the Clinton campaign, its surrogates and state party operations have built and unleashed a giant ground game, registering voters and urging them to turn out, with five times as many paid staffers as the GOP. But a parallel track is unfolding in progressive circles, where collectively, groups like Democracy for America, Progressive Democrats of America, Our Revolution and others are pushing, promoting, fundraising for and urging their ranks\u2014even those who don\u2019t like Clinton\u2014to elect scores of other candidates and vote on statewide ballot measures to move a progressive agenda. \\n\u201cI think there is growing confidence that we can win the presidential election. So that\u2019s not new,\u201d said Neil Sroka, spokesman for Democracy for America, which has endorsed 125 candidates . \u201cWhat we have been focusing on are the down-ballot races, the U.S. Senate races that up until recently haven\u2019t started getting a lot of attention. But also on city council races and state legislative races.\u201d\u201cOn November 8, we can measure how successful the progressive political revolution has been,\u201d said Shannon Jackson, executive director of Our Revolution , which grew out of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cWe have 105 progressive champions we are supporting. We have 31 different ballot races we are behind. We\u2019re calling, we\u2019re texting, we are organizing online. We are doing e-mails. We are assisting through our fundraising. We want to make sure they have the tools available to them so they can succeed.\u201dIn some cases, mainstream Democrats and progressive groups are supporting the same candidates and taking the same stances on ballot measures, such as pushing for health care reforms, raising the minimum wage and enacting campaign finance reform. But in other cases, the progressives are further to the left, embracing all forms of marijuana legalization, repealing the death penalty and opposing charter school expansion and anti-union right-to-work ballot measures. Donna Smith, executive director of Progressive Democrats of America , gave two examples illustrating these parallel tracks. \\n\u201cPDA is intensely focused on electing Doug Applegate in California\u2019s 49th Congressional District, where defeating Darrell Issa would be an added bonus,\u201d she said, referring to a Republican who has repeatedly sought to undermine President Obama. \u201cApplegate is a strong progressive who has been attacked by Issa on his progressive stands as highlighted by the PDA endorsement questionnaire. We have put substantial resources into that race.\u201d\u201cWe are also backing Nanette Barragan, CA CD-44, where even in a relatively safe Democratic district we must push to make sure we elect the most progressive candidate with a solid, respected track record,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cAcross the country we have focused on other congressional races where we can make real inroads and where we can still see hope for the policy agenda Sen. Bernie Sanders so brilliantly articulated during the presidential primary. The challenge has been to overcome some voter fatigue in areas where the coverage of the presidential contest has overshadowed many of these critical congressional races.\u201d The open question for progressives like Smith, who want to see the political landscape reshuffled to the left, and also for the Clinton campaign, which is urging Democrats to retake congressional majorities and governors\u2019 mansions, is how much attention will voters pay to down-ballot races? With Election Day quickly approaching, these groups are making every effort to engage them. This goes beyond the fundraising bonanza Paul Ryan unleashed when he groused that a Democratic Senate majority would put Sanders in the Senate Budget Committee chairman\u2019s seat, which DFA and Our Revolution seized on to raise several million dollars online for their candidates. DFA, for example, is pushing its Washington and Colorado members to pay attention to their state senate races, because picking up one or two seats would shift the legislative majority from red to blue. \u201cIf you can get people volunteering and taking action to support a candidate for local state legislature, those votes will trickle up,\u201d said Sroka, referring to the likelihood that people working hard for local races would end up supporting the federal candidates. \u201cAlso, there are some progressive Democrats who aren\u2019t super excited about the presidential race, and so that\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cWe want to make sure that there\u2019s a space for everyone in the fight to November,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause frankly, we need everyone\u2019s help. So focusing on the Senate race in North Carolina, as one example, is another one that until recently folks weren\u2019t focusing on [nationally]. We were paying attention to it, because it\u2019s a place where people could take action, have a meaningful role and help the ticket as well.\u201dSroka said DFA and Our Revolution are coordinating, explaining that DFA has more on-the-ground experience and a better grassroots network at this stage of the campaign, while Our Revolution is more of an online community. Jackson agreed, saying many Sanders supporters needed to pause after the Democratic Convention but rejoined the fray after Labor Day. Raising $2 million in 72 hours after Ryan\u2019s remarks showed how potent these progressives remain, injecting needed funds into dozens of races.\u201cWe want to make sure they have the tools available to them so they can succeed,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cFrom [U.S. House candidate] Zephyr Teachout in New York, from [U.S. House] candidate Pramila Jayapal out in Washington, from coast to coast. However you measure it, we are going to see progressive champions winning seats from school board to state senate to U.S. representatives and senators.\u201d It\u2019s hard to dissect all the factors that prompt voter registration and turnout. But registration for the 2016 election has closed in many states, with the number of registered voters across America breaching the 200 million mark for the first time. Meanwhile, ballots cast in early voting by registered Democrats are outpacing Republicans in many states at a comparable period before the 2012 election, according to media reports from Florida , North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and Arizona .\u201cWhen we look at the early voting numbers, we go, hmm. Something definitely is going on. Something different from the past. But it\u2019s very much on a state-by-state basis,\u201d Sroka said. \u201cWhat we do know is whether it is Florida or North Carolina or Nevada, Democrats are taking advantage of the organization structure they have on the ground this year in a significant way.\u201d \\n  \\n\u201cThat kind of success\u2026 is a reflection of grassroots power,\u201d he continued. \u201cTo get those kinds of numbers we are seeing with early voting takes contacts for volunteers, or contacts from the campaign. It\u2019s reflective of the kind of ground game that the Democrats may have over Republicans looking at the country overall.\u201dThat ground game isn\u2019t just coming from what\u2019s called the coordinated Democratic campaign\u2014the presidential and state party effort. In Nevada, big multi-ethnic unions like the Culinary Workers have been pushing voter registration for months and are now focusing on get-out-the-vote efforts. In California, the National Nurses United union and Sanders have been pushing a ballot measure requiring state government health programs pay the same price for drugs as the federal Veterans Administration, which would cut costs. That\u2019s not the only health care proposal pushed by Our Revolution. Colorado will vote on creating a statewide single-payer system.Down-ballot candidates and statewide initiative measures often don\u2019t get as many votes as the presidential campaign; people just skip them if they\u2019re not sure, which means they can pass or fail by smaller margins. Jackson said he did not know the latest polling on all of the statewide measures pushed or opposed by Our Revolution. But on those where he did review recent surveys, Jackson said it looks like many progressive positions are going to win.That appeared to be the case with the California drug-pricing measure, another California proposal to repeal the state\u2019s death penalty, measures in California and Washington calling for overturning the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United campaign finance decision, the medical or recreational marijuana legalization measures (outside the South), minimum wage hikes in Maine and Washington, and opposing charter school expansion in Massachusetts. Our Revolution is also pushing an automatic statewide voter registration proposal in Alaska, where any resident who receives an annual oil industry dividend from the state\u2014including 50,000 Native Alaskans\u2014would be on voter lists.So while the mainsteam media coverage is centered on the Clinton campaign and its enlarged focus to retake the Senate and shrink Republican majorities in the House and state capitals, the efforts of progressive groups, working inside and outside of traditional Democratic circles, may determine how deep and wide 2016\u2019s blue wave will be.'"}, "time": 1742561769.6618893}
