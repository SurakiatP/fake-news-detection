In the most recent batch, there is a transcript of a paid speech given by Bill Clinton at a \u201cHillary for America\u201d fundraiser while Hillary was secretary of state.\\nAn email from January 2016 from Tina Flournoy, Bill Clinton\u2019s aide, had an attached document with a transcript of a speech given by Bill Clinton at the home of Mike and Patti Miller in October 2015.\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t run for office in 20 years, and yet every election I feel like an old horse that once won a bunch of races and somebody comes to the barn, gives me an extra bale of hay, hauls me on the track and slaps me on the rump, just to see if I can get around one more time,\u201d Bill Clinton joked.\\nSpeaking about the presidential primary debates, Clinton said, \u201cThese people actually think they can insult their way to the White House, or compete with each other for who can say the most politically correct things.\u201d\\nSpeaking of the Iran nuclear deal, he said:\\nEven the people that don\u2019t like this Iran nuclear agreement like the sanctions that were imposed on Iran. She did that, and she got Russia and China to go along\u2026 you don\u2019t know yet whether this Iranian thing is going to be good or bad. It depends on whether we enforce it. And you\u2019ve got to have somebody in there tough enough, with enough connections in these other countries, to enforce the trigger that will re-impose the sanctions if they violate the rules.\\nSpeaking about Republicans who oppose Hillary Clinton, Bill said:\\nBecause, don\u2019t be fooled: these guys do a lot of serious psychological studies. And they know that if you badmouth somebody enough in the press, day in and day out, especially if you\u2019ve got your own microphone with Fox News, even if every single charge turns out to be false, you can hurt them.\\nReferring to a call he received from Barack Obama to tell him that Osama Bin Laden was killed, Bill said:\\nI could take CIA papers every day if I wanted to. I don\u2019t, because of Hillary\u2019s jobs in the Senate and Secretary of State, because I give too many public speeches and I\u2019d hate to accidentally say something that I read in a government document.\\n  Delivered by The Daily Sheeple \\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ). \\nContributed by The Daily Sheeple of www.TheDailySheeple.com . \\nThis content may be freely reproduced in full or in part in digital form with full attribution to the author and a link to www.TheDailySheeple.com.
