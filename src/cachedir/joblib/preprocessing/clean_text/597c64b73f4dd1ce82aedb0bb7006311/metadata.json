[Streep was reportedly set to wear Chanel on the red carpet before one of her handlers allegedly informed the fashion house to halt production of the dress.   \u201cI made a sketch, and we started to make the dress,\u201d Lagerfeld told WWD. The German designer said someone from Streep\u2019s team called days later and said, \u201cDon\u2019t continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us. \u201d \u201cA genius actress, but cheapness also, no?\u201d he said.  Streep, who\u2019s nominated for Best Actress for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins, denied that she demanded money to wear a dress at Sunday\u2019s awards ceremony. A representative for the three time   said the claim is \u201cabsolutely false,\u201d according to The Hollywood Reporter. Lagerfeld told WWD that it is Chanel policy not to pay entertainers to wear their couture to awards shows, despite what other fashion houses might do. \u201cAfter we gift her a dress that\u2019s 100, 000 euros [$105, 000] we found later we had to pay [for her to wear it]. We give them dresses, we make the dresses, but we don\u2019t pay,\u201d Lagerfeld explained.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742628387.8387341}
