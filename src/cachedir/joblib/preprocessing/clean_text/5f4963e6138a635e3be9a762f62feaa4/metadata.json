[The legal maneuver follows an executive order issued by President Trump Friday calling for temporary visa restrictions on seven countries connected to radical Islamic terrorism.  The suit had been filed by the ACLU on behalf of two Iraqi refugees who were detained at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport, despite that both men were later released. NBC reports that a Trump administration official said waivers would be granted for the two men. That didn\u2019t stop Judge Donnelly from granting the stay for others  \u2014   blocking anyone with a valid visa from being detained and keeping those stranded at airports from being deported. It does not mean they have to be released from detention. NBC also reported that the ACLU attorneys and a crowd outside the Federal Court in Brooklyn were elated by the ruling: \u201cStay is granted,\u201d ACLU Voting Rights Project Director Dale Ho said on Twitter. \u201cStay is national. \u201d Crowds outside federal court in Brooklyn cheered the news. The ACLU said the judge ordered a list of detainees to be provided, and said it would go through the names and ensure they are released. \u201cBut the critical point tonight is no one can be sent back to one of these countries,\u201d attorney Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said. Judge Donnelly was appointed by President Obama on the recommendation of current Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer ( .) who said about Donnely at the time, according to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle: \u201cAnn Donnelly met all of my qualifications with flying colors,\u201d Schumer continued. \u201cWhen you speak with Judge Donnelly, what\u2019s immediately clear is her deep respect and passion for the law. Judge Donnelly is more than a brilliant resume, I know her well and at her core she is a kind, thoughtful and compassionate person. \u201d There was no comment from the White House at press time.
