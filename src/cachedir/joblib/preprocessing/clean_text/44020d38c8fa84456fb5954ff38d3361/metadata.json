[\u201cI was really disheartened for a while it just brought up a lot of trauma for me,\u201d the    \u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d singer said in a cover story interview for this month\u2019s Vogue magazine. \u201cMisogyny and sexism were in my childhood: I have an issue with suppressive males and not being seen as equal. \u201d  \u201cI felt like a little kid again being faced with a scary, controlling guy,\u201d Perry added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t really stand for it in my work life, because I have had so much of that in my personal life. \u201d Months after the election, Perry has established herself as a vocal member of the   \u201cResistance\u201d movement. A month after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Perry performed at the 2017 Brit Awards alongside giant skeletons meant to skewer Trump and U. K. Prime Minister Theresa May. Just ten days prior, Perry performed at the 2017 Grammy Awards while wearing an armband that read \u201cPERSIST,\u201d along with a Planned Parenthood button. The singer\u2019s \u201cpurposeful\u201d pop has introduced what the singer hopes will be a new era of political activism, a time that has coincided with an \u201cawakening\u201d of young people she says are now more politically engaged than ever before. \u201cIt\u2019s an awakening that was necessary because I think we were in a false utopia, we can\u2019t ever get that stagnant again,\u201d Perry explained. \u201cI am so grateful that young people know the names of senators. I think teenage girls are going to save the world! That age group just seems to be holding people accountable. They have a really strong voice  \u2014   and a loud one. \u201d Just this week, Perry posted a picture of Clinton sporting a pair of pumps, called The Hillary, that the singer says were inspired by the former secretary of state. \u26a1\ufe0fPOWER PUMP\u26a1\ufe0fyour way over to https:  .  for the last few hours of the spring 25% sale\u2757@HillaryClinton is wearing #TheHillary pic. twitter.   \u2014   Katy Perry (@katyperry) April 11, 2017,  The $139 pumps, now for sale on Perry\u2019s website, include a clear heel embedded with golden moon and stars meant to inspire those who wear them to \u201cstep in and reach for the stars. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742564058.1296394}
