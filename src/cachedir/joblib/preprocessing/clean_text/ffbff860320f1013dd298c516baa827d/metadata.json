[According to comments made Thursday by ESPN\u2019s Jim Miller on SI Media Podcast with Richard Deitsch, dozens of employees will soon join the unemployment lines.  \u201cThe way that I\u2019ve heard it \u2014  and I\u2019ve kind of run the numbers on it, I think we\u2019re looking at between 40 and 50 people,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd look, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about who it\u2019s gonna be and why. Remember, this is not quantum physics, so it\u2019s not an exact equation. \u201d The plight of ESPN is no trivial matter for entertainment giant Disney, the parent company for the \u201cWorldwide leader in sports entertainment. \u201d In February, The Wrap reported, \u201cCable networks, particularly ESPN, have been an albatross on Disney\u2019s stock price even as the company\u2019s two other major prongs, movies, and theme parks, continue to perform well.  \u201cAs cheaper TV alternatives began to proliferate, ESPN hemorrhaged subscribers during the course of 2016 and is now at less than 88 million, compared with a peak of 100. 1 million in 2011. At an estimated $7 per subscriber, that dip has been a substantial hit to Disney, especially considering media networks made up 49 percent of Disney\u2019s profits during fiscal 2016. \u201d Miller presented a potential revised line up for the beleaguered network: 6 a. m.  \u2014     of Neil Everett and Stan Verrett\u2019s SportsCenter from the night before,   a. m.  \u2014   Mike Greenberg\u2019s newly announced show, which, as Miller points out, will feature only one   personality, 10 a. m.   \u2014   First Take, presumably still featuring Stephen A. Smith, Max Kellerman and Molly Qerim,   p. m.  \u2014   A widely rumored but     show featuring Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre,   p. m.  \u2014  \u201dThe normal kind of coverage of what they\u2019re doing, and Around the Horn and PTI, 6 p. m.  \u2014   SC6 with Jemele Hill and Michael Smith, Evening  \u2014   Live sports, 11 p. m.  \u2014   SportsCenter, Midnight  \u2014   Scott Van Pelt\u2019s SportsCenter show, 1 a. m.  \u2014   Everett and Verrett\u2019s SportsCenter show, Miller went on to say, \u201cIf you\u2019re ESPN talent and you\u2019re looking at a schedule that\u2019s something like that, based on the commitments they\u2019ve made, if you\u2019re not on that, then you\u2019re starting to feel a little shaky. \u201d But, he caveated,  \u201cThat\u2019s not to say everyone else is gone, but I think those are the people that should take a deep breath, and those are the people that should feel immune. \u201d Deitsch responded, according to his sources at ESPN, \u201cIf you are part of the SportsCenter unit right now but not one of the special talents where management has tapped on the shoulder and given the golden ticket, if I were one of those people I would be talking to my agent and my representation of how management thinks of me. \u201d Both Deitsch and Miller agreed that the most popular sportscasters will keep their jobs, however, they might be subject to substantial pay cuts.'"}, "time": 1742561890.6490378}
