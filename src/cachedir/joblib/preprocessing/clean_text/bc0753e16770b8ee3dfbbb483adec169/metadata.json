[In a strongly worded statement, Fitton says: \u201cIt is shameful that House Republicans are trying to destroy the Office of Congressional Ethics, the most significant ethics reform in Congress when it was established nearly a decade ago. \u201d  Judicial Watch focuses on the transparency, accountability and integrity in government and politics and remained a thorn in the side of the Obama administration, the Clintons, and Democrats for many years. \u201cThis   effort to eliminate the Office of Congressional Ethics, which provides appropriate independence and transparency to the House ethics process, is a poor way for the Republican majority to begin \u2018draining the swamp,\u2019\u201d Fitton says. Although the office was created under then Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2008, Judicial Watch worked with her to create an investigative body with independent power. \u201cThe American people will see this latest push to undermine congressional ethics enforcement as shady and corrupt,\u201d Fitton said. \u201cThe full House should seriously consider whether it wants to bear the brunt of public outrage and go through with the rule change this afternoon. \u201d Although House Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy reportedly opposed the rule changes, they allowed the vote to take place.'"}, "time": 1742562260.4881961}
