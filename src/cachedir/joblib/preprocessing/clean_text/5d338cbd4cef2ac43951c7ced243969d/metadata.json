Henry David Thoreau\u2019s classic \u201cWalden\u201d is the inspiration for what Smithsonian Magazine is calling \u201cthe world\u2019s most improbable video game\u201d: Walden, a Game. Instead of offering the thrills of stealing, violence and copious cursing, the new video game, based on Thoreau\u2019s   retreat in Massachusetts, will urge players to collect arrowheads, cast their fishing poles into a tranquil pond, buy penny candies and perhaps even jot notes in a journal  \u2014   all while listening to music, nature sounds and excerpts from the author\u2019s meditations. While the game is all about simplicity, it has actually been in development for nearly a decade. The lead designer, Tracy J. Fullerton, the director of the Game Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, came up with the idea as a way to reinforce our connection to the natural world and to challenge our hurried culture. \u201cGames are kinds of rehearsals,\u201d Ms. Fullerton said in an interview. \u201cIt might give you pause in your real life: Maybe instead of sitting on my cellphone, rapidly switching between screens, I should just go for a walk. \u201d The game  \u2014   which Ms. Fullerton said is likely to cost $19. 99  \u2014   takes six hours to play. It starts in the summer and ends a year later  \u2014   offering players tasks like building a cabin, planting beans or chatting, virtually of course, with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Should you not leave sufficient time for contemplation, or work too hard, the game cautions: \u201cYour inspiration has become low, but can be regained by reading, attending to sounds of life in the distance, enjoying solitude and interacting with visitors, animal and human. \u201d Failure to heed the warning will result in a dimming of color and thinning of music. \u201cYou can choose how to spend your time, what to emphasize, the ways the game can play out,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might spend all your time in the woods, you might focus on bean farming, you could become a famous author  \u2014   sending off articles to your editor, Horace Greeley  \u2014   or you could become an activist, working on the Underground Railroad. \u201d At a time when the most popular video games include the active participation of the player  \u2014   slay a soldier to capture enemy territory  \u2014   the Walden game seems passive by contrast. But Ms. Fullerton said it\u2019s no simple stroll in the park. Players who fail to forage for food, for example, will start to faint in the game. The goal is not to win in any competitive sense, but to achieve   balance. \u201cYou\u2019re not only trying to survive, you\u2019re seeking inspiration in the woods,\u201d Ms. Fullerton said, \u201cIf you spend all of your time grinding away on survival tasks, the environment will become less lush. The winning is based on whether you meet your own goals. \u201d The project has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, though some say video game research is unworthy of federal funds. And some Thoreau experts are not enthused by an electronic simulation of Walden Pond. \u201cGo out and see your own backyard,\u201d said Richard Higgins, whose book, \u201cThoreau and the Language of Trees,\u201d is to be published in April by the University of California Press. \u201cNature is all around us. \u201d But guardians of Thoreau\u2019s legacy say it could introduce Walden to a whole new audience. \u201cThese are people who are interested in interactive games,\u201d said Kathi Anderson, the executive director of the Walden Woods Project in Massachusetts. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re not the same as the people who would sit down and read Thoreau\u2019s book. \u201d Ms. Fullerton  \u2014   whose group also created the popular 2005 flying game Cloud  \u2014   consulted Ms. Anderson\u2019s organization, along with the Huntington Library in Los Angeles, to create the game. They went to considerable lengths to get the 1854 details right  \u2014   the types of trees, the sounds of   birds. Would Thoreau approve? He was clear about dismissing new technologies, if this quote is any indication: \u201cOur inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate. \u201d But Ms. Fullerton said the game  \u2014   to be released this spring in time for the 200th anniversary of Thoreau\u2019s birthday in July  \u2014     the very questions \u201cWalden\u201d raises about the personal costs of progress. \u201cThoreau was sitting in a moment when life was beginning to speed up and he identified that, asking \u2018Are our lives better because we now live on railroad time? \u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to ask ourselves the same question today: \u2018Are our lives better because we live on internet time? \u2019\u201d \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t all have the chance to go to the woods,\u201d Ms. Fullerton added. \u201cBut perhaps we can go to this virtual woods and think about the pace of life when we come back to our own world. Maybe it will have an influence  \u2014   to have considered the pace of Walden. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562030.9602401}
