The surge in donations came after militarized police arrived to clear out the camp, making mass arrests in the process.\\n\u201cThe money goes as quickly as it comes, but without it having been as much as it is, we certainly wouldn\u2019t have been able to be as productive as we have been in the fight,\u201d Wicasa continued.\\nAs of Sunday, 412 people have been arrested on various protest related charges, ranging from engaging in a riot, criminal trespassing, and conspiracy to endanger by fire.\\nThe campaign is one of several, which have collectively raised over $3 million in total to help with food, supplies, and legal expenses.\\n\u201cMilitarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today,\u201d Dave Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, said in a statement. \u201cWe have repeatedly seen a disproportionate response from law enforcement to water protectors\u2019 nonviolent exercise of their constitutional rights.\u201d\\nIn another effort this week, over 1.3 million people checked in to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Facebook. The goal was reported to have been throwing off law enforcement officials who were tracking protesters on social media, though the effectiveness of that is questionable. What the effort did do however, was spark many conversations and spread awareness of a very large and effective scale.\\nThe costs for preparing for winter are not cheap however \u2014 and the account setup for donations to Wicasa\u2019s GoFundMe had just $100,000 left as of Friday.\\n\u201cThe money has been used for grocery store trips every two days that cost about $2,000 each, 20 yurts purchased for $160,000, and around $7,000 for bail money. It has also paid for a storage area, composting toilets, tiny houses, tepees, a medical area and generators powered by solar panels and wind,\u201d CBS reported.\\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is suing the US federal government to stop construction of the 1,160-mile pipeline. They claim that tribal administration was not consulted, even though the pipeline runs through tribal lands, and that it endangers the water of millions of people.\\nThe pipeline will transport some 450,000 barrels of oil per day across the Missouri River \u2014 which provides the water for eighteen million people \u2014 meaning a leak would be absolutely catastrophic.\\nThe post Dakota Access Protesters Try to Raise $5K, Bring in Over $1.3 Million appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742562995.0446174}
