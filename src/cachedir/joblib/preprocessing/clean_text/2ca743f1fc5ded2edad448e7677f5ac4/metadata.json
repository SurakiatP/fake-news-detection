[\u201cWe are very happy to have Aya back home, and it\u2019s a great honor to have her in the Oval Office,\u201d Trump said on Friday during the meeting at the White House.  Trump arranged for a government aircraft to transport Aya Hijazi, 30, and her husband, Mohamed Hassanein, back to the United States, with the couple and family arriving late on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful that President Trump personally engaged with the issue,\u201d Aya\u2019s brother Basel Hijazi said in a telephone interview while onboard the plane. \u201cWorking closely with the Trump administration was very important for my family at this critical time. \u201cIt let us be reunited as a family,\u201d Hijazi said. \u201cWe\u2019re so grateful. \u201d Aya Hijazi grew up in Falls Church, Virgina, and is a graduate of George Mason University. Rather than spending money on a lavish wedding, the couple used their money to launch the Belady Foundation to help children who live on the streets in Cairo, human rights advocates wrote in a piece published by The Huffington Post. Instead, the couple was arrested, and months later, they were told they had been charged with sexually assaulting the children in their care. A hearing was delayed seven times during the course of three years. \u201cHijazi brought the best of her American education and values to Egypt in an attempt to make the world a better place,\u201d Kerry Kennedy, president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights (RFKHR) and Wade McMullen, RFKHR attorney, wrote in the Huff Po. \u201cShe faced the same political repression many defenders of human rights face,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHer vindication is proof that even small efforts to improve our world can create ripples that shake even the most entrenched authoritarian governments. \u201d \u201cThe couple and their   had been incarcerated since May 1, 2014, on child abuse and trafficking charges that were widely dismissed by human rights workers and U. S. officials as false,\u201d the Associated Press (AP) reported on Wednesday. \u201cVirtually no evidence was ever presented against them, and for nearly three years they were held as hearings were inexplicably postponed and trial dates canceled. \u201d The Obama administration, members of Congress, and human rights groups had failed to secure Aya\u2019s release, in part because former President Barack Obama had shunned President Abdel Fattah   while Trump established a relationship with him, including issuing the first invitation to the White House. \u201cSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ( ) who said he recently advocated for Hijazi\u2019s release in his own talks with Sisi and was briefed on the latest negotiations, said Trump \u2018handled it the way things like this should be handled,\u2019\u201d the AP reported.'"}, "time": 1742563663.5890012}
