{"duration": 0.09490108489990234, "input_args": {"text": "'YouTube has restored the official channel for conservative blog Legal Insurrection following coverage from Breitbart News and a number of other media outlets. [The YouTube channel was originally removed \u201cbased on excerpts of audio of   and   speakers at the MLA Annual Meeting,\u201d which Legal Insurrection covered \u2014   exposing a number of individuals who wanted to lead a boycott against Israel.  In response to the coverage, the MLA filed a copyright claim against the audio of speakers recorded during the meeting, and Legal Insurrection\u2019s channel was suspended. However, the site claims that they never received a warning or a copyright strike prior to the channel\u2019s removal. Copyright infringements are usually sanctioned with a single strike, cautioning the channel against any further incidents. YouTube opts to remove a channel after three strikes. \u201cWhile I\u2019m glad our YouTube channel is restored, the fact remains that we were removed without any prior notice or chance to defend ourselves against what we believe are unjustified copyright claims,\u201d said Legal Insurrection Founder William Jacobson. \u201cWe intend to fight the copyright claims if they are pursued in court. \u201d \u201cIt is highly questionable that MLA owns the copyright for oral presentations at the Annual Meeting, and even if it did, the limited excerpts we used from the nearly   video posted by MLA on YouTube are   fair use,\u201d declared Legal Insurrection in a blog post last week. \u201cWhat I think is really going on here is that   activists at MLA complained to MLA that MLA had posted the audio on YouTube. MLA took down its own   video and now seeks to silence our reporting. \u201d YouTube has previously censored conservative channels on their site, most notably targeting PragerU\u2019s educational videos. Last year, YouTube placed some of PragerU\u2019s videos on \u201crestricted mode,\u201d a mode designed to stop children from viewing inappropriate adult content. Videos covering topics such as whether George Bush lied about the Iraq War, the university \u201cdiversity scam,\u201d and whether Sharia Law and freedom can coexist were all placed on restricted mode \u2014   meaning the videos couldn\u2019t be watched at schools, libraries, or on computers with parental blocks.
