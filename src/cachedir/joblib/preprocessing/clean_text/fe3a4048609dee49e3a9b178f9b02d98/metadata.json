Then Exxon Mobil showed up. Under its chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, the giant oil company sidestepped Baghdad and Washington, signing a deal directly with the Kurdish administration in the country\u2019s north. The move undermined Iraq\u2019s central government, strengthened Kurdish independence ambitions and contravened the stated goals of the United States. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s willingness to cut a deal regardless of the political consequences speaks volumes about Exxon Mobil\u2019s influence. In the Iraq case, Mr. Tillerson and his company outmaneuvered the State Department, which he has now been nominated by   Donald J. Trump to lead. \u201cThey are very powerful in the region, and they couldn\u2019t care less about what the State Department wants to do,\u201d   Seznec, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a research group in Washington, said of Exxon Mobil\u2019s pursuits in the Middle East. As America\u2019s biggest oil company, with operations on six continents and a stock market value of more than $390 billion, Exxon Mobil is in some ways a state within a state. While Mr. Tillerson has never officially been a diplomat, he has arguably left an American footprint on more countries than any nominee before him  \u2014   with an agenda overseas that does not always mesh with that of the United States government. Under Mr. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil has struck lucrative deals with repressive governments in Africa, clashed with China and befriended Vietnam over disputed territory in the South China Sea, learned from hard experience in Venezuela, and built a close rapport with Russia at a time of deepening mistrust between the Kremlin and the West. Mr. Trump emphasized the unique role Mr. Tillerson had played in pursuing his company\u2019s interests around the world, announcing the selection on Tuesday by saying that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s \u201ctenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics make him an excellent choice for secretary of state. \u201d But the task is a new one for Mr. Tillerson, who as chief executive made it clear that a broad range of national interests and diplomatic priorities were not his main concern. His focus was access to energy. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re able to do that, where it comes from should be of little consequence to us, if it\u2019s reliable,\u201d he said at the Council on Foreign Relations in June 2012. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s first big overseas test came soon after he became Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive in 2006, when he confronted the government of Venezuela    \u2014   and suffered the consequences. The company had worked in Venezuela for decades, but   Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, calling for a   revolution to benefit the poor, began renegotiating the industry\u2019s contracts. By 2007, the Venezuelan government set its sights on projects that included oil industry titans like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total. Foreign companies soon began cooperating with Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s government, but Exxon Mobil and another company, ConocoPhillips, balked at the changes. \u201cFrom the very beginning, Exxon sent strong signals that they would not be run over, they would use all their legal rights, and they would be more confrontational,\u201d said Francisco Monaldi, a former consultant for Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, PDVSA. In response, Venezuela expropriated the assets of both companies. Exxon Mobil took Venezuela to an arbitration court, and got a disappointing outcome. In 2014, seven years after the dispute began, the World Bank\u2019s international arbitration court found in the company\u2019s favor, but awarded only about   of what Exxon Mobil said the assets were worth. The company has not operated in Venezuela since. \u201cIn my opinion, he took it very personal with Ch\u00e1vez,\u201d said Ghassan Dagher, a Venezuelan oil industry consultant, adding that Mr. Tillerson \u201cfell into the trap completely. \u201d It was a lesson that may have helped inform Mr. Tillerson\u2019s dealings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, he said. \u201cOnce Exxon finished with Chavez\u2019s story, they said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to make the same mistake.\u2019 That\u2019s why they became so close to Putin. \u201d Mr. Tillerson has had success guiding his company through the    politics of the Russian oil business. Exxon Mobil executives said Mr. Tillerson was not available for an interview. But they argued that he and Mr. Putin are not friends, countering criticism in the United States that Mr. Tillerson is too close to Russia to take a strong stance against it. Mr. Putin awarded Mr. Tillerson a medal of friendship for concluding corporate deals in Russia. Not long after, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s oil industry in 2014 over Moscow\u2019s deadly intervention in Ukraine, leading American foreign policy and the company\u2019s investment goals to diverge. Exxon Mobil now has billions of dollars in deals that will move forward only if the sanctions are lifted. Some officials and executives argue that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s   approach to Russia could ease tensions, a view questioned by many diplomats, rights groups and advocates of disarmament. Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Putin, praised Mr. Tillerson, saying Russia was ready to find a way out of the \u201cridiculous condition\u201d between the two great powers. \u201cWe want out of this crisis situation,\u201d he said. In West Africa, Exxon Mobil has made lucrative deals with the government of Equatorial Guinea, which arbitrarily detains and tortures critics, disregards elections, and has faced international prosecution for using oil profits to enrich the president\u2019s family. Tutu Alicante, the director of the watchdog organization EG Justice, said that by doing business in Equatorial Guinea, Exxon Mobil was complicit in reinforcing President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  \u2014   a strongman who has held office since 1979. \u201cExxon definitely has enabled a government that once upon a time was very repressive but didn\u2019t have the resources to keep itself in power,\u201d Mr. Alicante said. As for the selection of Mr. Tillerson as secretary of state, he added, \u201cFor just about anyone who cares about transparency in extractive industry, this is a devastating pick. \u201d Mr. Obiang and his family have faced investigations in the United States and elsewhere for looting hundreds of millions of dollars from Equatorial Guinea\u2019s treasury to buy real estate in Malibu and Paris, as well as   statues of Michael Jackson. The president\u2019s son is under investigation for money laundering in France and Switzerland, where the authorities seized 11 luxury cars including a Bugatti Veyron valued at about $2 million. Most of the population of Equatorial Guinea lives on less than a dollar a day. Documentation of questionable practices in the country began before Mr. Tillerson ascended to the chief executive position. In 2004, an American Senate subcommittee identified a bank in Washington where Exxon Mobil and other oil companies deposited hundreds of millions of dollars owed to Equatorial Guinea for operating there. The cash went to the president\u2019s family, the subcommittee\u2019s report found. \u201cThe government literally used the oil wealth of the country as a personal A. T. M. ,\u201d said Arvind Ganesan, a director at Human Rights Watch. The same kind of behavior continues, he argued. But Alan Jeffers, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said that when dealing with countries that have records of corruption, the company was careful to follow the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribes to foreign officials to do business. \u201cWe\u2019re a company that follows the laws,\u201d Mr. Jeffers said. \u201cAbsent a law prohibiting something, we evaluate it on a business case basis. \u201d The company has been both complimented and criticized in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer. When Exxon, the precursor of Exxon Mobil, acquired Mobil\u2019s operations in Nigeria in the late 1990s, it was given credit for righting misdeeds, including bribery and negligence, said Matthew Page, a consultant who until recently was the State Department\u2019s top expert on Nigeria. \u201cThey came in with a much more rigid,    management culture and totally cleaned up Mobil\u2019s operations there,\u201d he said. More recently, under Mr. Tillerson\u2019s tenure, Exxon Mobil\u2019s offshore facilities have been attacked by militants in the Niger Delta who contend that the nation\u2019s oil wealth overwhelmingly benefits a small circle of Nigerian elites, yet causes broad environmental damage like oil spills. The company says it takes environmental protections seriously, including in places that have weak regulations or enforcement. \u201cWe\u2019ll impose environmental standards on our own operations that may not necessarily be required by law,\u201d Mr. Jeffers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good practice as a responsible operator. \u201d Mr. Page said that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s experience in negotiating deals around the world would help him in the role of America\u2019s top diplomat. \u201cExxon has this reputation as being    in terms of its negotiations in other countries, and Tillerson was the big hitter,\u201d he said. \u201cHe would fly around the world negotiating these deals with foreign heads of state. From that viewpoint, he\u2019s a natural for secretary of state. \u201d But under Mr. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil has also been criticized for a lack of transparency in dealings with the Nigerian government. The country\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission is investigating a 2009 license renewal deal for Exxon Mobil, after allegations that the company was significantly outbid by a Chinese competitor. Critics contend that the deal was done illegally. \u201cThey were running a very corrupt and opaque renewal process,\u201d Olanrewaju Suraju, the chairman of the Civil Society Network Against Corruption in Nigeria, said of the Nigerian government in power at the time. Some analysts said that Exxon Mobil had a singular goal overseas. \u201cThe one clear trend that runs through Exxon\u2019s foreign policy is that they are really all about business and doing what is best for shareholders,\u201d said Ben Van Heuvelen, the managing editor of Iraq Oil Report. \u201cThey are willing to look the other way in the face of a whole host of problems. \u201d But Robert M. Gates, who served as secretary of defense under President Obama and President George W. Bush, said he had recommended Mr. Tillerson to Mr. Trump. Mr. Gates, whose consulting firm has represented Exxon Mobil, said Mr. Tillerson would be more than capable as America\u2019s top diplomat: \u201cI think Rex is a   realist, and I think he will absolutely put America\u2019s interests first in any negotiation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628565.1634321}
