Anthony\u2019s grave site, in Rochester, is a perennial destination for women celebrating their freedom to vote, but on Election Day, Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx would like to remind New Yorkers to share the love. At Woodlawn, the grave sites of four other prominent suffragists could use some \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers, like those dotting Anthony\u2019s grave, David Ison, the cemetery\u2019s executive director, said on Monday. The cemetery will even provide the stickers. The idea for turning the sites into    destinations came this year after seeing the popularity of Anthony\u2019s grave site grow on social media, Mr. Ison said. The need for some positive messaging after a bruising election season was also important. \u201cWe thought, \u2018We\u2019re going to do something that\u2019s not all about Trump and all about Clinton,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ison said. On Election Day, visitors will be encouraged to leave their stickers on cardboard signs next to the grave sites of four suffragists buried in Woodlawn: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anthony\u2019s friend and a   of the National Woman Suffrage Association Carrie Chapman Catt, who founded the League of Women Voters and who is buried next to Mary Garrett Hay, who assisted and advised her and Alva Vanderbilt Belmont, a multimillionaire who gave her opinions and her money to the movement. On Monday, as the sun was setting and shadows turned the cemetery chilly, the site of Stanton\u2019s grave was lonely. About 15 \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers were posted near the family monument. A single sticker for Hillary Clinton, the country\u2019s first female presidential nominee from a major party, who has nodded to the suffragists\u2019 legacy throughout her campaign, was also posted. Only one visitor passed by, a man who called out \u201cnot yet\u201d to a reporter\u2019s remark that no sticker for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponent, Donald J. Trump, had been posted. The graves of the three other suffragists were also deserted. The quiet display is in contrast to reports from the resting place of Susan B. Anthony, where women approach every few minutes with their daughters, friends and mothers. This year, the Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester anticipates so many visitors that it said it would be open extended hours on Election Day to allow voters the opportunity to swing by and leave a sticker. Barbara Selesky, Woodlawn\u2019s director of marketing, said on Tuesday that the cemetery would extend its visiting days, inviting people to leave their \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers until Sunday. For visitors who make the trek to the Bronx, the crew at Woodlawn asks just one thing: Please keep the stickers off the granite. The museum has put up a display next to the tombstone where visitors can leave stickers and other sticky mementos. \u201cStickers on graves have become a problem,\u201d Susan Olsen, the cemetery\u2019s historian, said. \u201cIt\u2019s love and it\u2019s honoring, but it just causes problems. \u201d At Woodlawn, a cemetery roughly half the size of Central Park, the legacy of four prominent suffragists competes for the limelight with several more famous neighbors, including Miles Davis, Celia Cruz and Herman Melville. When asked to explain the difference in popularity, Mr. Ison and Ms. Olsen both joked in unison, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to do in Rochester. \u201d (Also, they said, Anthony was on the $1 coin.) But if the work of the suffragists has taught us anything, it\u2019s that Stanton and Anthony might not have seen this as a competition. In a way, it may be fitting of how they saw their different legacies: Stanton, a married mother of seven who lived in New York, supplied speech material and support as Anthony traveled extensively as a public face of the movement. \u201cThey saw their relationship very clearly,\u201d Ms. Olsen, Woodlawn\u2019s historian, said. \u201cShe\u2019s in the metropolis, and Anthony goes all over the place. They were brilliant as far as how their partnership worked. \u201d Neither woman lived to see the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920. In Stanton\u2019s obituary, published in The New York Times in 1902, Anthony fondly recalled their dynamic, saying, \u201cShe forged the thunderbolts and I fired them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564515.8774288}
