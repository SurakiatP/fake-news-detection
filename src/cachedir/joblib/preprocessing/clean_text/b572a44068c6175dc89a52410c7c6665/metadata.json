We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord\u2019s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.\u201d \\nHillary Clinton weighed in on exceptionalism in an August speech before the American Legion, in which she also took a swipe at Donald Trump : \\nThe United States is an exceptional nation. . . . But, in fact, my opponent in this race has said very clearly that he thinks American exceptionalism is insulting to the rest of the world. In fact, when Vladimir Putin, of all people, criticized American exceptionalism, my opponent agreed with him, saying, and I quote, \u2018if you\u2019re in Russia, you don\u2019t want to hear that America is exceptional.\u2019 Well maybe you don\u2019t want to hear it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true. \\nIt needs to be asked, though: when people praise or criticize \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d are they always talking about the same thing? \\nAmerica, like any country, has its own distinctive history, culture, and traditions. America\u2019s unique founding principles\u2014consent of the governed, due process, a constitutionally limited division of powers, representative government\u2014justly have been an inspiration to the world for over two centuries. Thomas Jefferson wrote of the \u201cpalpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God.\u201d \\nThis \u201cexceptional\u201d idea was new in human history. Any American worthy of the name justly takes pride in it. This is the genuine American exceptionalism of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, lately championed by Reagan. The fact that we have strayed so far from it, both domestically and internationally, is shameful. \\nThe unique moral revolution to which the Founding Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor has little connection to the bastard term (usually capitalized as \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism\u201d) that describes post-Cold War U.S. global behavior, by which policymakers in Washington assert both an exclusive \u201cleadership\u201d privilege and unsupportable obligation to undertake open-ended international missions in the name of the \u201cFree World\u201d and the \u201cinternational community.\u201d This is the counterfeit \u201cExceptionalism\u201d of a tiny clique of bipartisan apparatchiki \u2014GOP \u201cneoconservatives\u201d and Democrat \u201cliberal interventionists\u201d and their mainstream media mouthpieces \u2014who have little regard for our country\u2019s oldest traditions or the security and welfare of the American people.
