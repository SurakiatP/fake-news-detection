[\u201cI\u2019ve been on the Armed Services Committee for 10 years. No call or meeting with Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of the Foreign Res Com,\u201d McCaskill tweeted on Thursday.  Almost immediately following her Tweet, McCaskill\u2019s past Tweets contradicted her claim, including two retweeted by National Review Online Editor Charles C. W. Cooke showing a Tweet in 2013 and another in 2015 that said the senator spoke and met with Kislyak. Claire McCaskill says she\u2019s had \u201cno call or meeting   ambassador. Ever. \u201d But she tweeted about two. It\u2019s easy to forget. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Charles C. W.

When asked by Breitbart News why she claimed she had never met or spoken with the Russian ambassador when her Tweets showed otherwise, McCaskill\u2019s communication director defended her by saying she had not met \u201c  \u201d with him. \u201cAttorney General Sessions met    with the Russian ambassador in the midst of a Russian cyber campaign against the U. S. and then misled the Judiciary Committee under oath about that meeting,\u201d John LaBombard told Breitbart News via email. \u201cHe then tried to excuse it by saying it was part of the normal course of his Armed Services Committee work. \u201cClaire has never met    with the ambassador, and never received a call from him,\u201d LaBombard said. \u201cShe did attend a group meeting about adoptions with other senators, and had a brief proactive call with the ambassador amid calls to several other parties to the Iran nuclear deal. \u201cAttorney General Sessions, on the other hand, misled the Senate under oath,\u201d LaBombard said.'"}, "time": 1742564013.8363388}
