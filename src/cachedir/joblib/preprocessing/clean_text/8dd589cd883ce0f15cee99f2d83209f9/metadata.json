The 45th president of the United States grinned and waved at cheering supporters as he whispered the simple instruction into a henchman\u2019s ear. An onlooker said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear who \u2018they\u2019 are but I think we can assume it\u2019s people with whom Donald is not on the best of terms, or whose features are not ideally suited to modern America. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too early to say why they were being \u2018got\u2019. Perhaps they were being taken to a nice celebration party with free massive cookies for all, or maybe something a tad more sinister. \u201cI think he also mentioned \u2018get the witch first\u2019 but it was hard to hear over all the cheering. \u201cThese really are interesting times.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742564322.6449237}
