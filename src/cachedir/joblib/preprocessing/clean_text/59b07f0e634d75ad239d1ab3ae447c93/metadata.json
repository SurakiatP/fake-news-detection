[Worth an estimated $2. 7 Billion, Thiel made his money by   conventional wisdom.    of Paypal and an early investor in Facebook, Thiel has proven his contrarian mindset can lead an outlier to decisive victory in business and investing, but can it translate to politics?  According to Politico, Thiel \u201chas been discussing a prospective bid with a small circle of advisors, including Rob Morrow, who has emerged as his political consigliere. Morrow has worked at Clarium Capital, the San   investment management firm and hedge fund that Thiel started. \u201d The    entrepreneur may have to explain that he only intends to be governor of the most ungovernable state  \u2014   not king of a new country. After all, just last week Mr. Thiel told Maureen Dowd of the New York Times that California should secede from the union. Maureen Dowd: California should secede. Peter Thiel: Confirm. I\u2019d be fine with that. I think it would be good for California, good for the rest of the country. It would help Mr. Trump\u2019s   campaign. But that won\u2019t be his biggest challenge. In order to win, Thiel will have to take a page out of   Donald Trump\u2019s playbook, and unite some widely disparate factions in California\u2019s \u201cjungle primary\u201d  \u2014   where the top two candidates advance to the general election regardless of party. If he can win over some of the #CalExit left who want to secede and also pull in some of those on the right who\u2019ve been pushing for an independent State of Jefferson in the inland and   counties, he might have a chance. Both the Republican and Democrat parties have been shrinking in favor of the   demographic that identifies as \u201cneither\u201d (a. k. a. \u201cdecline to state\u201d). That really puts California in play for the right candidate  \u2014   with the right message. The question is: is Peter Thiel that candidate? In the age of Trump, how does he compare? Clearly, Thiel will be attacked from the left for supporting Mr. Trump, and he\u2019ll be attacked from the right for supporting Mr. Newsom. How he addresses the most controversial issues  \u2014   taxes, water rights, illegal immigration, entitlement reform and gun rights \u2014   will determine if Thiel\u2019s to have any chance at all. Yet the key to winning California isn\u2019t being the smartest candidate, but the one who can put into words the angst and frustration and fears of some of the most oppressed people in the free world. And then lay out a vision to Make California Great Again.
