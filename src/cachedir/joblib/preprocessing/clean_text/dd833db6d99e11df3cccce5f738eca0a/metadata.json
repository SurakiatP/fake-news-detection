Everywhere we look, we see freedom of speech and freedom of religion suppressed to appease a small group of Americans. \\nBut there is hope, as some still know what their duty entails. \\nChristian News reports : \\nAn activist that often works to separate God from the military is seeking the punishment of an Air Force commander who responded to a recent interview question that Jesus is his guide and influences his decisions. \\nOn Sept. 15, the focus was on U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Michael Kersten, who serves with the 39th Medical Support Squadron. The unit provides \u201cpreventative and clinical health and wellness services for U.S. and coalition forces.\u201d \\n\u201cIs there a leader from your career that influenced you the most?\u201d he was asked during the interview. \u201cIf so, who, and how did they affect the way you lead?\u201d \\n\u201cThere\u2019s no ONE in particular, Kersten responded. \u201cAs a Christian, my example is to be like Christ. He is my guide and affects all of my decisions. He teaches to do all things as unto the Lord and I believe this is synonymous with integrity first and excellence in all we do.\u201d \\nOf course, atheist troll Mikey Weinstein was very displeased to see such statements on a government website. Therefore, Weinstein wrote to the base commander to have punishment inflicted for such actions. \\nChristian News continued: \\n\u201cHe has essentially stated that Christianity (or his particular interpretation/denomination of same) is the guiding policy of HIS command,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cHe has VERY publicly endorsed his singular view of Christian faith supremacy and it is not unreasonable or irrational to think that this widespread endorsement in an official Air Force internet publication could and/or would lead to preferential treatment of those subordinates who share his views.\u201d \\nHe, therefore, demanded that Kertsen be both rebuked and punished. \\n\u201cMRFF demands that you (1) expeditiously and publicly rebuke Lt. Col. Kersten\u2019s official statement\u2014as contrasted with his private Christian faith belief which is not MRFF\u2019s concern\u2014(2) appropriately and visibly punish Lt. Col. Kersten for his unconstitutional and UCMJ-violating behavior; (3) apologize to your airmen and our Turkish allies, and; (4) reaffirm an inclusive 39th Air Base Wing command climate\u2026\u201d Weinstein wrote. \\nIsn\u2019t it cute that he thinks that someone would be scared of his list? Glad to report that Col. John Walker was not. \\nChristian News reports: \\n\u201cThe Air Force places the highest value on the rights of its personnel in matters of religion by its members,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur Airmen are sworn to protect our rights and liberties as Americans, including the right of all Airmen to practice their religious faith of to practice no faith at all.\u201d \\nA second letter has been sent, but, so far, Walker has not replied. \\nIt is possible that he has just chosen to ignore Weinstein. \\nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com shares '"}, "time": 1742562084.2542098}
