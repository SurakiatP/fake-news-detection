Judging from her Facebook page, one might even assume that she is \u201chot, hot, hot for Trump!\u201d since she enjoys using that phrase so much. That tone was evident in her interview with O\u2019Reilly when she mentioned that she heard Bill saying earlier that maybe the \u201cTrump momentum\u201d had slowed down. \\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in Michigan, then,\u201d Palin said, \u201ccos they are hot, hot, hot for Trump!\u201d \\nO\u2019Reilly, with uncharacteristic fairness, points out that Hillary Clinton is sill leading in the polls: \\n\u201cThe polls say that Clinton\u2019s up by five.
