Closing his eyes, he tried to leave behind the burden of his 13 years of captivity. Mr. Qader was about 17  \u2014   an overweight Yemeni teenager suspected of being a terrorist  \u2014   when the United States military brought him to Guant\u00e1namo. When he left, he was past 30, his hair thinning, and about to start a new life in Estonia, a tiny Baltic country he had never heard of before it had decided to resettle a detainee a few months earlier. A day later, he was in his new home, a modestly furnished studio apartment in Tallinn provided by the Estonian government. But the past, he soon realized, was not so easy to escape. Snow was falling, and he was eager to touch it. He started for the door, then suddenly panicked, fearful that something  \u2014   he was not sure what  \u2014   could go wrong if he went outside. \u201cAny trouble I get myself in now  \u2014   even an honest mistake  \u2014   will be a hundred times worse than if any normal person did it,\u201d Mr. Qader said recently, trying to explain how that sense of paralysis has stayed with him. \u201cI thought that after two months\u2019 release, I\u2019d be back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I cannot live my life regularly. I try, but it is like part of me is still at Guant\u00e1namo. \u201d Mr. Qader is one of about  780 men who have been held at the prison since the Bush administration opened it after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. A central part of the war on terrorism, Guant\u00e1namo was an experiment: using indefinite detention without trial, a tool of traditional wars, for an   conflict in which distinguishing truly dangerous enemies from people caught on the periphery can be particularly difficult. President Obama inherited 242 detainees when he came into office vowing to close the prison. Today 76 remain, 32 of them approved for transfer to a stable country willing to accept them. Congressional Republicans oppose closing the prison and further transfers, pointing to the minority of former detainees accused of recidivism. In the long and contentious debate over Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s future, former detainees who have been transferred and caused no problems have been largely forgotten. But while their files may have been closed, the ambiguity surrounding their release  \u2014   deemed safe enough to transfer, but never proven guilty or innocent  \u2014   continues to brand them. Mr. Qader recently told me his story in a series of conversations over several days this spring  \u2014   in his apartment, strolling through Tallinn\u2019s medieval Old Town, and riding a city bus to Estonia\u2019s Islamic Center. He expressed gratitude to Estonia for taking him in. Its refugee program provides him with the apartment, health care, language classes, a small monthly stipend and a mentor to help him navigate daily life. He smiled often and spoke with optimism about the future when we talked. But he also lapsed into despondency about his separation from his family, his lost youth, and his \u201churt\u201d when people call him a terrorist. He portrayed himself as paralyzed by anxiety about what others  \u2014   the police, potential friends or employers  \u2014   will assume about him. \u201cThirteen years of my life I wasted, and it\u2019s not because of something I did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because something went wrong around me, and I got the blame for it. \u201d Mr. Qader was arrested with about a dozen other Arabs at a guesthouse in Pakistan in March 2002. That night, the Pakistani police also raided another guesthouse in the same city, capturing a prominent terrorism suspect, Abu Zubaydah. The police conflated the two houses, saying both harbored what were thought to be cells of Al Qaeda. But the evidence linking the group to Mr. Qader\u2019s house, where many residents claimed to be religious students, was thinner. Mr. Qader was transferred to American custody, and that June, he was flown to Guant\u00e1namo. He vividly recalls the \u201clong, long, long\u201d flight to Cuba  \u2014   limbs immobilized, eyes and ears blocked, destination unknown. At first, Mr. Qader said, guards were often rough. An Estonian doctor is treating him for ligament damage in his knees and shoulder  \u2014   the result, he said, of treatment like being kicked into the kneeling position or being forced to kneel on concrete with his arms extended. Asked what provoked punishment, he sang a lyric from a prisoners\u2019 song in \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d: \u201cLook down, look down   Don\u2019t look \u2019em in the eye. \u201d Every few months, Mr. Qader was brought to a trailer and questioned. He told interrogators that after completing the ninth grade in Yemen in 1999, he had traveled to Pakistan intending to study religion and computers, and to do charitable relief work. With the financial support of his father, he traveled around, staying for several months at a time in different guesthouses. He also crossed into Afghanistan, where he said he met several Taliban members who invited him to an area north of Kabul behind the front lines in their war against the Northern Alliance. He lived there about 10 months. Reports summarizing his early interrogations say he was \u201cissued\u201d a rifle and \u201ctrained\u201d to use it. Mr. Qader, claiming translators had put an exaggerated gloss on his words, told me a Taliban member spent a few minutes showing him how to hold and shoot a rifle, and he never \u201cowned\u201d one. Either way, Mr. Qader insisted, then and now, that he never fought or enlisted with any group, and in late 2001, he returned to Pakistan, where he was eventually arrested. \u201cAs unusual as this source\u2019s story sounds, I don\u2019t think he is hiding the truth,\u201d an interrogator wrote about Mr. Qader in January 2003. But when the interrogators showed his photograph to other detainees, some claimed he was involved with Al Qaeda. The military compiled his story and those accusations in a 2008 dossier, which described him as a Qaeda member. The dossier was leaked, and it is readily available on the internet. Over the years, Mr. Qader said, his bewilderment at being in Guant\u00e1namo gave way to routine. Conditions gradually improved. By reading books and talking to guards, he learned English. Still, the 2008 dossier described him as \u201cnoncompliant and hostile to the guard force. \u201d Mr. Qader said that in 2007, believing certain guards treated him unfairly, he \u201cpushed back\u201d by refusing for a while to obey orders, like to leave a yard when his outdoors time was up. In 2009, a   detainee review task force   Mr. Qader and, according to someone who read its report, concluded he had not conducted or facilitated any terrorist activity against the United States or its allies. That finding, officials said, is echoed in many reports about   detainees, and it is ambiguous: It could either mean he was innocent or, though part of the enemy, did nothing specific. Either way, the task force deemed him a low enough risk to be transferred. But after an unsuccessful attempt by Al Qaeda\u2019s Yemen branch to set off a bomb on a   plane that Christmas, Mr. Obama halted repatriations to Yemen until its security improved. The moratorium spurred the Justice Department to appeal government losses in habeas corpus lawsuits, and in 2010, an appeals court instructed judges to interpret ambiguous evidence more toward the government. Detainee victories ceased. Mr. Qader\u2019s lawsuit, brought by Wesley Powell, a New York lawyer, reflected the pattern: A judge ruled his detention lawful. By then he lived on a cellblock for the most compliant and westernized detainees  \u2014   those who liked watching American movies despite actresses with uncovered heads. When a hunger strike swept the prison in 2013, they did not participate, he said, although he had sometimes participated in earlier such protests. Finally, in 2014, the Obama administration stopped waiting for Yemen to stabilize and began pressing other countries to resettle stranded Yemenis. After Russia intervened in Ukraine, Estonia  \u2014   another former Soviet republic, and a NATO member  \u2014   agreed to take one. \u201cEstonia understood the value in demonstrating its reliability as a friend and ally and was willing to help us,\u201d recalled Jeffrey Levine, then the American ambassador to Estonia. Ian Moss, the chief of staff in the State Department office that negotiates transfers, remembers watching Mr. Qader\u2019s interview with Estonian officials. He was struck by Mr. Qader\u2019s reply when asked when he was born. (He says November 1984 some files say 1983.) \u201cMy birthday will be the day I leave Guant\u00e1namo,\u201d Mr. Qader said. At first, he recalled, he processed everything in his new country \u201clike a newborn,\u201d unaware that his transfer was controversial. But the timing was terrible  \u2014   his release, on Jan. 14, 2015, came a week after a terrorist attack in Paris and as the Syrian refugee crisis was mounting. In the United States, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told Fox News, \u201cIt is insane to be letting these people out of Gitmo to go back to the fight. \u201d Some Estonians were upset, too, like the reader of a news article about his arrival who appended the comment: \u201cI say out of the country, now!\u201d Mr. Qader recalled thinking: \u201cI think I will never be free until I get my name cleared. I will always be \u2018that guy who was in Guant\u00e1namo.\u2019 \u201d He decided to keep a low profile, declining interviews and telling few people about his past. That summer, a shop in Tallinn gave Mr. Qader an apprenticeship. The owner later told me how he came to suspect that the refugee was the Guant\u00e1namo detainee he had read about in the news media. He found the dossier online but concluded that its terrorism accusations were \u201call bullshit. \u201d One morning, he told his apprentice that he was \u201cfamous. \u201d Mr. Qader acknowledged who he was, expecting to be told to leave. Instead, the owner invited him to visit his mother on an Estonian island. Mr. Qader  \u2014   apprehensive about leaving Tallinn  \u2014   hesitated for days but went. Not all Estonians were as welcoming. Last fall, a drunken neighbor began hassling him about being a foreigner, Mr. Qader said. When it escalated  \u2014   the neighbor threatened him with a gun and put garbage at his door  \u2014   he called the police. The harassment ceased. But days later, two police officers showed up and grilled Mr. Qader  \u2014   asking where he came from and got money. When he explained, they conferred in Estonian he understood the word \u201cCuba. \u201d They said not to worry. But he said he could not sleep for four days. Now, when Mr. Qader contemplates the future, he said, he feels like a man holding a \u201csmall candle. \u201d \u201cPeople tell me \u2018don\u2019t look back, look forward,\u2019 but the problem is when I look forward, it is dark,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what scares me the most. \u201d Estonia recently extended his residency permit by two years. But its population of 1. 3 million people includes only a few thousand Muslims and fewer Arabs. Halal food is scarce, and Mr. Qader interprets stares on the bus as hostile. He would like to return home, but he said he feared that Yemeni or American security forces might mistakenly decide he was working with terrorists and jail him again  \u2014   or kill him with a drone. Estonia will permit family visits, but obtaining travel documents has proved difficult. His father, who had a heart attack after finding out he was at Guant\u00e1namo, calls him daily, and his mother has taught him to cook over Skype. Last year, Mr. Qader\u2019s family helped arrange for him to become engaged to one of his sisters\u2019 friends. Estonia permits spouses to join refugees, so they were married in December by a Yemeni judge over Skype. They now talk daily, he said, but his wife has not managed to come yet, either. In theory, he could visit nearby European countries  \u2014   he is supposed to consult Estonian officials first  \u2014   but he has not dared leave. Comforted by the thought that the Estonian government is monitoring him, he fears that if he travels abroad and a bomb goes off nearby, he might be unable to prove his innocence and would be scapegoated and imprisoned again. Asked what he thinks about the United States, Mr. Qader said he understood why, after Sept. 11, it would detain him. Still, he said, it should have freed him after a year or two imprisoning him for so long \u201churt me very bad. \u201d Emphasizing that he is \u201cnot out for revenge,\u201d he \u201cbegged\u201d American officials to consider helping him move on by clearing his name. \u201cNow you let me go,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you very much. No hard feelings. But just let me go for real. Say, \u2018This guy, we hold him this long and we were mistaken, we\u2019re sorry,\u2019 and show people the truth. \u201d But Lee Wolosky, the State Department\u2019s special envoy for the closing of Guant\u00e1namo, demurred, saying \u201cno apology is warranted\u201d for Mr. Qader\u2019s detention, given the circumstances. \u201cThe United States was correct to pick him up when and where we did and to detain him for a period of years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were also right ultimately to release him subject to security assurances. \u201d Either way, Mr. Qader knows some things are up to him. Not long ago, he said, he heard a story about elephants who died in a circus fire. They were tied with a flimsy rope but had been trained in chains as babies, learning not to try to break free. \u201cWhen this story hit me, I was thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be locked inside my own Guant\u00e1namo,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI promised myself that I have to break free from myself. And I told my wife, \u2018I will take you to Paris.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Qader said his wife, who has never left Yemen, replied that when she finally reached Estonia: \u201cI will explore the world with you. I will hold you to your word. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562993.4170778}
