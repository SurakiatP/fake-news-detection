When President Obama lands next Sunday in Hanoi, his visit will be chronicled by photographers, cameramen and journalists who will track every public move of only the third presidential visit to Vietnam since the end of the American war there. Mr. Obama\u2019s former defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, said he is already bracing for the onslaught of recollections those pictures and articles are likely to inspire. \u201cI know those images will hit me,\u201d said Mr. Hagel, whose 12 months as a soldier in Vietnam remain the defining period of his life, despite the subsequent years as both a senator and a cabinet secretary. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make it all come back. \u201d For Mr. Obama, the trip to Vietnam offers an opportunity to help solidify not only his promised pivot of American policy toward Asia, but also to deepen economic and security ties with an increasingly important regional player. But for the United States\u2019 Vietnam War veterans, a presidential trip to the country where many of them lost their youth, innocence and some of their closest friends is weighted with powerful emotions and   debates about that war\u2019s consequences. \u201cThere are still a lot of ghosts around,\u201d Mr. Hagel, 69, said in an interview. \u201cThere is still a great deal of debate about Vietnam and what it meant for this country. \u201d \u201cIt still haunts us,\u201d he added. \u201cThat terrible waste of lives, and the lessons we learned there, the terrible lessons that still hang over us. \u201d Mr. Hagel said that every decision he made as defense secretary and every piece of advice he gave Mr. Obama was informed by his experience in Vietnam. He now finds himself thinking more and more about the year he spent there in the 1960s. And he said he is certain to closely study the pictures from Mr. Obama\u2019s trip: the lush green background, the people and their iconic conical hats. One of the stumbling blocks between the two nations is the continuing belief by some in the United States that there may still be captive American soldiers held there, the kind of mythology that was fueled by 1980s movies like \u201cMissing in Action\u201d starring Chuck Norris and the \u201cRambo\u201d series starring Sylvester Stallone. A black P. O. W. . I. A. flag still flies above the Capitol and state capitols around the country, and the military and many lawmakers choose to focus on the retrieval of the remains of dead service members as fulfilling those concerns. But some leaders of veterans organizations insisted in a meeting on Friday at the White House that Mr. Obama ask Vietnamese leaders whether there are living prisoners, according to Frank Francois III, the chief executive of Service Disabled Veteran Enterprises, who attended the meeting. \u201cOne of the questions that has to be asked is whether there is anybody in jail or captivity or someone living in the area we need to know about,\u201d Mr. Francois said. For other veterans, Mr. Obama\u2019s trip will serve as a welcome reminder to two generations of Americans who have come of age since the war\u2019s end, illustrating that conflict\u2019s importance to the United States. For these men, the ghosts of the war should not have been so easily laid to rest. \u201cVietnam is a totally forgotten issue nowadays,\u201d said Bobby Muller, a disabled veteran and antiwar activist whose life helped inspire the 1978 movie \u201cComing Home,\u201d starring Jane Fonda. \u201cTo have gone through those times and have something as huge and powerful and affecting and tragic in our lifetimes wind up nonexistent in the consciousness of the country today is stunning. \u201d Mr. Muller lives in Washington in an apartment that is filled with books on the war, and his anger at two wartime leaders  \u2014   President Richard M. Nixon and his closest adviser, Henry Kissinger  \u2014   remains undiminished. Mr. Obama is unlikely to focus as much on combat deaths during his trip as President Bill Clinton did when he visited in 2000. Mr. Clinton took the two sons of a missing airman, Lt. Col. Lawrence G. Evert, to a rice paddy in a tiny town 17 miles northeast of Hanoi and searched, along with scores of villagers, for the remnants of an     that had crashed in 1967. Remarkably, they found Colonel Evert\u2019s bones. Mr. Obama is more likely to hail cooperation between the two countries to clean up the remnants of Agent Orange, one of the wartime issues still important to Vietnam. But as a president who came of age after the war ended, he is unlikely to be a symbol of healing of the psychological wounds that some veterans suffered upon returning home, when many of their countrymen disdained them for fighting there. \u201cThat lack of a welcome home is still a national shame,\u201d said Senator John McCain, a Vietnam veteran who, because he was a prisoner of war, did receive a hero\u2019s welcome. \u201cYou had   or    draftees who did their duties and were literally spat upon by their fellow citizenry when they returned. \u201d Mr. McCain said the country has learned that lesson, and service members and veterans are routinely celebrated at sporting events and public occasions nowadays. But for some veterans, Mr. Obama\u2019s visit is likely to stir bitter memories of their rejection, he said. Mr. McCain, a Republican of Arizona, said his efforts to help normalize relations between Vietnam and the United States were among the proudest accomplishments of his life, and he said he had been to Vietnam so often since the war\u2019s end that \u201cI\u2019m recognized more in the streets of Hanoi than I am in Phoenix. \u201d Those efforts long ago helped Mr. McCain put the worst of the war and his captivity behind him, so he is unlikely to be moved by the photos of Mr. Obama\u2019s visits, he said. Mr. McCain said he had other ways of stirring his wartime memories. \u201cTo this day, I\u2019ll get up real early sometimes and go down to the Vietnam Memorial just as the sun is coming up,\u201d Mr. McCain said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always a great experience for me to think and remember. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628581.3849616}
