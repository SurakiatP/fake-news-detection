Prosecutors dropped more serious charges against Ms. Heard that claimed that she had illegally imported the dogs, Yorkshire terriers named Pistol and Boo, which could have resulted in a   jail term and a fine of 20, 000 Australian dollars, or about $15, 350. The couple also produced a video acknowledging their transgression and urging others to obey the law, which is intended to prevent the spread of rabies and other diseases. Ms. Heard acknowledged that she had disembarked from her private jet without declaring the dogs, which arrived with her. Her lawyer, Jeremy Kirk, said Ms. Heard, 29, thought that Mr. Depp\u2019s staff had handled the paperwork for the pets. She was   and exhausted, he said. Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard appeared in the local courthouse, where hers was just one of more than 200 cases listed for the day. Fans, some with dogs dressed for the occasion, lined the sidewalk hoping to see the celebrities. In court, the couple handed over their video. \u201cAustralia is a wonderful island with a treasure trove of unique animals, plants and people,\u201d Ms. Heard said. The dogs came to the attention of the authorities after a groomer posted photographs of them on social media in May. By then, they had been in the country for around three weeks. The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, told Mr. Depp that unless the dogs were taken out of the country within 72 hours, they would be euthanized. Like many countries, Australia requires that animals be placed in quarantine upon arrival. \u201cIf we start letting movie stars  \u2014   even though they have been the sexiest man alive twice  \u2014   to come into our nation\u201d with pets, said Mr. Joyce, now the deputy prime minister, \u201cthen why don\u2019t we just break the laws for everybody?\u201d The dogs, he said, should return to the United States. The couple returned to California but publicly criticized the Australian government as being overly zealous, setting off a controversy that the local news media called the \u201cWar on Terrier. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563470.1292503}
