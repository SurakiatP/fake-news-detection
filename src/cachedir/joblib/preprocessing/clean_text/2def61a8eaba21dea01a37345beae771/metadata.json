You might, however, find yourself wondering if this Trump fellow is a reality television star, a titan of industry or a vintner. Trump chardonnay and Trump sauvignon blanc (about $25 each) line the shelves of the Marketplace Cafe at Trump National Doral Miami. Trump nail polish sets ($25) glittery Trump pouches ($30) and Empire by Trump eau de toilette ($62) are sold in a gift shop. A lounge area is replete with framed magazine covers of Donald J. Trump. There he is on Newsweek, mouth agape, pointing at the viewer, beside the words, \u201cYou\u2019re Fired!\u201d There he is in a tuxedo on the cover of Playboy with Brandi Brandt, a former Playmate, who appears to be clad in nothing more than his suit jacket. And there he is gazing at the camera, chin in hand, on the cover of GQ in an issue about \u201cmen who take risks and make millions. \u201d But it is the 2011 cover of a golf magazine, Fairways and Greens, that really grabs the viewer. Mr. Trump, with a golf club at his side, is shown next to the words: \u201cPresident Trump?\u201d Turns out, it was a prescient question. Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy has drawn attention not only to his policy positions, but also to everything that bears the Trump name, including about a dozen   hotels and resorts from Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii, to Turnberry Ayrshire, Scotland. This year, Trump Hotels  \u2014   the hotel company founded in 2007 by Mr. Trump and three of his children (Donald Jr. Ivanka and Eric)  \u2014   is planning to open Trump International Hotel  Tower Vancouver, Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro and Trump International Hotel, Washington, D. C. In coming years, the company said it will expand to Asia. And next year, it will introduce a lifestyle hotel brand. While the Trump name is ubiquitous, Trump Hotels may not be as familiar to travelers as larger brands with longer histories like Marriott and Hilton. Are Trump Hotels as big, brash and over the top as the man for whom they\u2019re named? In visits to Trump properties in and around New York, Miami and Las Vegas, I set out to see how it feels to be a guest of the man who would be president. As you roll across the paths of Trump National Doral Miami in a golf cart emblazoned with a Trump crest, bird calls alternate with the thwack of golf balls, and every staff members offers a friendly nod or hello. Acre after acre is manicured with   flower beds, orderly rows of palm trees and clipped greens where golf luminaries like Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have trod. A fallen palm frond the size of a surfboard hadn\u2019t been on the ground more than a few minutes before an employee pulled up in a golf cart, lifted it onto the roof and drove off, trailing an electric whir, and then, silence. It was a muggy spring afternoon, and the quietude belied the news that had broken days earlier. A staff member said the PGA Tour, which has held an annual tournament at Doral for more than half a century (the Trumps bought the property in 2012) was planning to move it  \u2014   to Mexico. Mr. Trump, who last year had choice words for Mexican immigrants, broke the news on May 31 that the Tour is moving: \u201cThey\u2019re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance,\u201d he told Fox News. The PGA Tour commissioner said the move was  not a political statement. The next day, however, Ricardo Salinas, the chief executive of the Mexican conglomerate that\u2019s moving the tournament, tweeted at Mr. Trump: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join us at the WGC,\u201d he wrote, referring to the World Golf Championships. \u201cOnly good things can turn out, if you know the real Mexico. \u201d Though the PGA Tour may be a thing of the past, Mr. Trump has poured some $250 million into the resort\u2019s future. In April, nearly 50 \u201cspa suites\u201d were opened near the Trump Spa, part of the property\u2019s extensive renovation. The suites, decorated in rich blues with abstract art that evokes the ocean, include soaking tubs use of the Trump Spa lounge areas and, in the evening, Trump wine. Inside the suites (a night in a   in June was $425) one finds Trump Hotel Collection products like bath crystals and a Trump yoga mat bag, one of several amenities to encourage \u201cwellness. \u201d Gold is used sparingly: Objets d\u2019art and glass boxes for storing jewelry or sunglasses lend an understated glamour. Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising then that the spa suites were overseen not by Mr. Trump, whose aesthetic is more aligned with opulent hotels in the Middle East and Asia, but by Ivanka Trump, an executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization. Admiring a decorative gold sphere, I turned over a nearby vase to see if it had a mark from a designer like Kelly Wearstler or Jonathan Adler. It had a sticker: West Elm. Maybe someone ought to have peeled it off. But I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t: Design trends today mix high and low with abandon one can picture young d\u00e9cor buffs sharing photos of the suites on Pinterest. The gold sphere was $29 to $39 on WestElm. com cream and gold coasters on the coffee table were $31 for four. A charming bud vase had a CB2 sticker ($10. 95 on CB2. com). Generally speaking, the hallways and rooms of Trump Hotels are surprisingly subdued, save for the occasional Trumpian flourish: a gold toilet handle, or chandeliers that appear to have been sized for the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d giant Wun Wun. Beyond the gold and glossy exteriors and marble lobbies, the private spaces are   decorated in grays, cream and chocolates. That restraint extends to other aspects of the properties. Music at the pools and restaurants is often, refreshingly, not at full volume. And the hotels are nonsmoking, even in Las Vegas, a city where you can burn your paycheck at any number of hotel casinos. Yet Trump International Hotel Las Vegas doesn\u2019t have a casino. Rather, it sells Trump piggy banks for $10. The facade of the Las Vegas property is another matter it\u2019s the hotel with the unrepentant Midas touch. The building looks like a bar of gold bullion but, after all, it\u2019s Vegas Mandalay Bay is equally blinding. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball caps are proffered in the Trump Store ($30) and adorn the bar at the poolside cafe, H2 Eau, amid bottles of vodka. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re going to be thinking anyway,\u201d reads a quote from Mr. Trump splashed across a   mirror at H2 Eau, \u201cthink big. \u201d The maxim applies to the rooms. My room in Las Vegas, upgraded to a suite at    \u2014   possibly because the staff is attentive and it was the third time I booked a hotel as a Trump Card member (the brand\u2019s free loyalty program) or because the hotel figured out where I work (I didn\u2019t book using a New York Times email or phone number, though I used my name)  \u2014   included a   refrigerator, a Wolf stove and a Bosch dishwasher. Even at Trump SoHo New York, the smallest rooms are an impressive 420 square feet. The price of admission befits a luxury hotel. The cheapest available room on a July weekend at Trump International Hotel  Tower New York was $563 a night, according to a recent online search. At Trump International Hotel  Tower Chicago, it was $420 a night. That said, rooms are not always out of reach. For instance, one search turned up rooms at Trump International Hotel Las Vegas for $165 a night. Restaurant prices are what one expects at   hotels. At BLT Prime at Trump National Doral Miami, ahi tuna was $37 a   New York strip steak was $51. The hotels also tend to have cafes and shops with affordable sandwiches and snacks. If, however, you get a yen for, say, the bag of gold Trump chocolate bullions in your room at Trump SoHo, it will set you back $35. Sitting at a table in the Trump Bar at Trump Tower New York, the skyscraper used as Wayne Enterprises in the film \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises,\u201d Ivanka Trump said the Trump Hotels customer can\u2019t be pigeonholed. \u201cWe have millennials,\u201d she said one spring evening during a reception in conjunction with the N. Y. U. International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, \u201cpeople from the entertainment business, entrepreneurs, titans of industry and those at the beginning of their careers. \u201d During recent visits to Trump Hotels, I met men and women on vacation or traveling on business, some with families. Guests spoke English, French, Chinese, Hebrew and more. The Trump Hotels website is available in several languages, including Chinese and Arabic, even as Mr. Trump proposes to squeeze China and bar Muslims from entering the United States. Asked to describe their guests, staffers at Trump SoHo said they are chief executives, athletes and actors. The Kardashians have been frequent visitors, though that doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect their politics. \u201cI know you like the Trump hotel, but honestly how do you feel about Trump running for president? ,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s friend, Malika Haqq, asked her in November on their vlog, Ebony  Ivory. Ms. Kardashian replied: \u201cWha \u2014   how does that have to do with the Trump hotel?\u201d \u201cWell, no,\u201d she continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think he should be president. \u201d Other celebrity guests have chimed in, too. After Mr. Trump said that he would bar Muslims from entering the United States, Lucy Lawless, who played the title role in the television series \u201cXena: Warrior Princess,\u201d tweeted: \u201cI used to stay in Trump hotels. Can never again,\u201d and urged her more than 140, 000 Twitter followers to boycott the brand. Recently, \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d created a fake commercial for Trump Hotels with the tagline \u201cWe\u2019re not to blame!\u201d and apologies to groups Mr. Trump may have offended. Indeed, some companies think Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has hurt his hotel business. Hipmunk, the travel comparison site, said in May that \u201cwhile overall Hipmunk hotel bookings have been on the rise    that has not been the case with bookings of Trump Hotels. \u201d The share of Trump bookings on Hipmunk as a percent of total bookings was down 59 percent year over year. In New York City and Las Vegas, Trump Hotels\u2019 share as a percentage of each city\u2019s total hotel bookings tumbled more than 70 percent. But Trump Hotels executives say the brand has never been stronger. Four of its hotels were among the 0. 4 percent of hotels that made AAA\u2019s Five Diamond list this year. Asked at Trump Tower if Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has helped or hurt the hotels, Ivanka Trump said \u201cit\u2019s been an upward trajectory,\u201d adding that it may have been the case without the campaign. Behind the    sheets, there has been controversy, from the bankruptcy of Mr. Trump\u2019s hotels and casinos in Atlantic City, N. J. to a lawsuit involving Trump SoHo from buyers who alleged they had been defrauded. More recently, Mr. Trump is suing the chefs Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and Geoffrey Zakarian, both of whom canceled plans to open restaurants in the Trump International Hotel, Washington, D. C. because of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Mexican immigrants. Still, the family business rolls on. In the fall the company plans to share details about its new lifestyle hotel brand, as yet unnamed. One name it won\u2019t have is Trump. Is that because the name isn\u2019t good for business? Ivanka Trump said it\u2019s because some properties simply aren\u2019t right for the Trump brand. It\u2019s common, in fact, for hotel companies to spawn brands that don\u2019t use their name. Marriott, for instance, has nearly 20 brands, including the  . So, are Trump Hotels as splashy as the man for whom they\u2019re named? Only on the surface. Beyond the facades and lobbies there\u2019s a feeling of calm and comfort. No smoking. No gaudy colors. Even the service is what one employee called \u201cghost service\u201d  \u2014   omnipresent but silent. Mr. Trump, too, is omnipresent. Just not silent. In guest rooms he appears in videos about Trump Hotels on a television channel in a seemingly   loop. \u201cThe thing I do best is build,\u201d says Mr. Trump during one featuring the forthcoming Trump hotel in the nation\u2019s capital, set to open weeks before the United States presidential election. \u201cBetter than \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cBetter than politics. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562328.5116632}
