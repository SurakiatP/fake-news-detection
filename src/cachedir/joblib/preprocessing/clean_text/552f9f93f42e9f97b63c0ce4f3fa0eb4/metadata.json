Partial transcript as follows: WALLACE: I want to ask you a direct question, does the president think that Rod Rosenstein has done anything wrong? SEKULOW: The president has never said anything about Rod Rosenstein doing anything wrong. Here\u2019s what  \u2014   what is the legal situation here. There is a constitutional issue when you have this scenario. The president made a determination based on consult of advice. He decided ultimately. He\u2019s the commander in chief. He gets to make that decision that James Comey had a go. That was coming, by the way, from groups right, left, and center over the last year. You  \u2014   you and I know that. So there had been concern about James Comey. It was put forward in a memorandum  \u2014   that\u2019s what the president\u2019s referencing  \u2014   from the deputy attorney general and the attorney general requesting the removal of James Comey as the FBI director. And, ultimately, that\u2019s the president\u2019s determination. So here\u2019s the constitutional threshold question, Chris. The president takes action based on numerous events, including recommendations from his attorney general and the deputy attorney general\u2019s office. He takes the action that they also, by the way, recommended. And now he\u2019s being investigated by the Department of Justice because the special counsel under the special counsel relations reports still to the Department of Justice. Not an independent counsel. So he\u2019s being investigated for taking the action that the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended him to take by the agency who recommended the termination. So that\u2019s the constitutional threshold question here. That\u2019s why, as I said, no investigation  \u2014   WALLACE: Well, I  \u2014   what  \u2014   what  \u2014   what\u2019s the question (INAUDIBLE). I mean you  \u2014   you stated  \u2014   you stated some facts. First of all, you\u2019ve now said that he is getting investigated after saying that you didn\u2019t. SEKULOW: No. WALLACE: You  \u2014   you just, sir, that he\u2019s being  \u2014   SEKULOW: No, he\u2019s not being investigated! WALLACE: You just said that he\u2019s being investigated. SEKULOW: No, Chris, I said that the  \u2014   any  \u2014   let me be crystal clear so you  \u2014   you completely understand. We have not received nor are we aware of any investigation of the president of the United States, period. WALLACE: Sir, you just said two times that he\u2019s being investigated. SEKULOW: No. The context of the tweet, I just gave you the legal theory, Chris, of how the Constitution works. If, in fact, it was correct that the president was being investigated, he would be investigating for taking action that an agency told him to take. So that is protected under the Constitution as his article one power. That\u2019s all I said. So I appreciate you trying to rephrase it, but I\u2019m just being really direct with you, Chris. This is  \u2014   let me be  \u2014   WALLACE: No, I  \u2014   I  \u2014   sir, I didn\u2019t rephrase it. The tape will speak  \u2014   Jay, the tape will speak for itself. You said he is being investigated. And it\u2019s not that big  \u2014   SEKULOW: Chris, he is  \u2014   just  \u2014   no, Chris  \u2014   that\u2019s (INAUDIBLE) unfair, Chris. WALLACE: Wait a minute  \u2014   wait a minute. Jay, and it\u2019s not  \u2014   Jay, it\u2019s not just being investigated for firing Comey. There\u2019s also the question of what he said to Comey when Comey was still the FBI director. So there\u2019s more than just the fact that he fired Comey. SEKULOW: He  \u2014   Chirrs, let me be clear, you asked me a question about what the president\u2019s tweet was regarding the deputy attorney general of the United States. That\u2019s what you asked me. And I responded to what that legal theory would be. So I do not appreciate you putting words in my mouth when I\u2019ve been crystal clear that the president is not and has not been under investigation. I don\u2019t think I can be any clearer than that. WALLACE: Well, you don\u2019t know that he\u2019s not under investigation again, sir. I mean you might  \u2014   SEKULOW: You know, I can\u2019t read the mind  \u2014   you\u2019re right, Chris, I can\u2019t read the minds of the special prosecutor. WALLACE: Well, then, good, OK, so we\u2019re in agreement, you don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s under  \u2014   you don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s under investigation. SEKULOW: But I have not been notified. No one has been notified that he is. WALLACE: You don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s under investigation or not. SEKULOW: Chris, I  \u2014   WALLACE: The question I\u2019m asking you is, does he think that Rod Rosenstein  \u2014   it\u2019s a very simple question  \u2014   does he think that Rod Rosenstein did anything wrong? SEKULOW: The president has not expressed any opinion about Rod Rosenstein. WALLACE: Does he think that Robert Mueller has done anything wrong? SEKULOW: First of all, he has not said anything about Robert Mueller. And, Chris, let me say something here. You\u2019re asking me if I had a conversation, which I have not had, about Robert Mueller with the president of the United States on  \u2014   or anyone else for that matter. I can\u2019t discuss that and would that with you. Unlike James Comey, who leaks information to the press, I actually respect the   privilege. Apparently, he did not. WALLACE: Does the President believe  \u2014   well, you\u2019re speaking for his legal team, so you\u2019re out here to represent him and tell us what the president\u2019s belief is, is that correct? SEKULOW: No, I\u2019m out here to tell you what the facts are and the legal issues are. I\u2019m not to tell you what the beliefs are. I\u2019m not the client\u2019s conscience I\u2019m his lawyer. WALLACE: I understand that and the  \u2014   and the client  \u2014   have you spoken the  \u2014   have you spoken to the president at all? SEKULOW: Yes, but I\u2019m not going to discuss those conversations with you. Those are privileged under the   privilege. WALLACE: Well, I assume that if he asked you to say something, for instance, Marc Kasowitz said all kinds of things about  \u2014   after Comey\u2019s testimony. I assumed he was speaking for the president, SEKULOW: Marc Kasowitz made a general statement to the press after the testimony of James Comey. That\u2019s what that was about. This  \u2014   you\u2019re asking me now questions about what people are thinking in their minds, which I don\u2019t read minds, and you\u2019re asking me also what I may or may not have had a conversation with the president about and you understand this. I respect the   privilege, unlike James Comey. WALLACE: Does  \u2014   SEKULOW: I want to be real clear on that too. I\u2019m not going to give you conversations I\u2019ve had with  \u2014   have or have not had with the president of the United States. So when I\u2019ve had conversations with the president of the United States  \u2014   WALLACE: Well, I  \u2014   your  \u2014   SEKULOW: As his lawyer, it\u2019s privileged, period. WALLACE: Does the president think that Rosenstein, because you talked about this constitutional theory that he took action, that\u2019s on the advice  \u2014   SEKULOW: Yes. WALLACE: Although he says he didn\u2019t take it on the advice of Rosenstein, does he think that Rosenstein should recuse himself, and is healing the groundwork to fire Rosenstein and Mueller? SEKULOW: I\u2019ve had no conversations, and I\u2019ve heard nothing without that at all. Nothing. I think this  \u2014   Chris, this points out  \u2014   let me tell you one thing quickly about the constitutional theory, as you called it. It\u2019s actually called the Constitution. You know, the president has certain (INAUDIBLE) authority under the Constitution. It\u2019s  \u2014   WALLACE: Well, you called it the constitutional theory, sir. SEKULOW: Yes, it is a constitutional theory based on the Constitution. WALLACE: I understand that. SEKULOW: Not  . It\u2019s the constitutional theory. It\u2019s part of the Constitution. The president has inherent authority. Here\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to  \u2014   here\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do, Chris, and I appreciate that you\u2019re  \u2014   you\u2019re trying to push back. WALLACE: Well, now you\u2019re reading minds again. Now you\u2019re reading minds again. SEKULOW: No, Chris, I deal with fact and law. You were asking me to read people\u2019s minds. That I don\u2019t do. WALLACE: Well, don\u2019t tell me what I\u2019m trying to  \u2014   well, don\u2019t tell me what I\u2019m trying to do because you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to do. What I\u2019m trying to get is a straight answer out of you. Let me ask you this  \u2014   SEKULOW: Yes, well  \u2014   sure. WALLACE: As a matter of law, does the President think that he can be indicted under the Constitution? SEKULOW: The president  \u2014   I haven\u2019t had that conversation with the president, but the president can\u2019t be indicted under the Constitution of the activity alleged in something like this. Of course not. WALLACE: Why is that? SEKULOW: Because there\u2019s not an investigation. And there\u2019s  \u2014   there\u2019s no investigation against the president. WALLACE: Well, you don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s an investigation. Oh, boy, this is weird. You  \u2014   you don\u2019t know that there\u2019s  \u2014   whether there\u2019s an investigation. You just told us that. SEKULOW: Chris, you\u2019re asking me to speculate  \u2014   so then what you\u2019re asking me to do is to speculate on  \u2014   WALLACE: And it would matter. I\u2019m asking you as a matter of law, not whether there\u2019s an investigation. Does the president think he can be indicted as president? SEKULOW: For  \u2014   for  \u2014   WALLACE: That\u2019s a constitutional issue, isn\u2019t it? SEKULOW: For obstruction of justice? No, the Constitution\u2019s  \u2014   WALLACE: No, for any of it. SEKULOW: Now, Chris, you know, let\u2019s  \u2014   let\u2019s be realistic here. You know what the  \u2014   the answer is. Can the president be indicted for obstruction? You know what the position has been at the Department of Justice since the 1970s and again stated in 2000. That\u2019s not what President  \u2014   that\u2019s now how you engage a president. There\u2019s a political process if somebody did something wrong. You\u2019re talking about  \u2014   you\u2019re conflating a constitutional process, criminal law, with an issue of political consequence. So I am his lawyer. I\u2019m not his political advisor. WALLACE: Senator Dianne Feinstein, a top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, responded to the president\u2019s tweet this week with this statement. \u201cThe message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn\u2019t apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired. \u201d Is she wrong, sir? SEKULOW: Yes, she\u2019s wrong. First of all, Dianne Feinstein also called for an investigation of James Comey and Loretta Lynch for that whole episode regarding her engagement and calling it a, quote, \u201cmatter,\u201d not an \u201cinvestigation. \u201d But with regard to this particular issue, I mean the tweet  \u2014   there\u2019s nothing illegal or inappropriate about the tweet. If the tweet came on the heels of a Washington Post story that had five anonymous sources and didn\u2019t even identify the agency from which those sources came from, and that\u2019s what he tweet in response to. It\u2019s that simple, period. WALLACE: Final question, the president just  \u2014   just added John Dowd, a   Washington lawyer, to his legal team. Should we expect him to hire other criminal lawyers? And, in a sense, is he preparing for a potential legal battle here? SEKULOW: Look, I mean John Dowd is  \u2014   is a legal legend, you know that, in  \u2014   in  \u2014   in the  \u2014   in Washington, D. C. and the president is doing the appropriate thing by hiring lawyers necessary, if there was to be an investigation, if there were to be an investigation, you have the lawyers in place. We\u2019ve got a great legal team led by Marc Kasowitz. We\u2019ve got John Dowd on the team. This is a solid team. Contrary to some of the press reports, a deep team, if necessary. WALLACE: Do you think  \u2014   I  \u2014   I  \u2014   I misspoke. I\u2019m going to ask one more question. Because I\u2019m not allowed to ask you what the president thinks, do you think that he should stop  \u2014   SEKULOW: Of course. WALLACE: Do you think he should stop tweeting about this case? SEKULOW: Look, I  \u2014   here\u2019s the thing on that. You know, people have been asking me that. Look, the president has changed the way in which engagement goes in  \u2014   I mean you\u2019ve got great ratings, no doubt about it, Chris. But let\u2019s face it, the president speaks to 107 million people through his social media platforms. He revolutionized the election process by utilizing media in a different way. So I  \u2014   I think, look, the president knows the effectiveness of social media. He\u2019s been very effective at it. Again, I\u2019m his lawyer, I deal with the issues. Nothing that he\u2019s tweeted is causing me any issues whatsoever at this point. Nothing. WALLACE: Jay, thank you. Thanks for coming in. SEKULOW: Thanks, Chris. WALLACE: It\u2019s always  \u2014   it\u2019s always interesting to talk to you. Please, come back, and we\u2019ll  \u2014   SEKULOW: Thanks, Chris. WALLACE: We\u2019ll continue it and maybe this time we\u2019ll get on this  \u2014   you know what, be here in studio and we can stay on the same wavelength. SEKULOW: There we go. WALLACE: All right, sir  \u2014   SEKULOW: Happy Father\u2019s Day. WALLACE: Happy Father\u2019s Day to you too, sir. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN '"}, "time": 1742562110.9524305}
