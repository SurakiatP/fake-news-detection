The ceremony, held in Cartagena, brought an end to a    war with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, whose Marxist insurgency marked the last major war in the Americas. \u201cWhat we sign today is a declaration from the Colombian people before the world that we are tired or war,\u201d President Juan Manuel Santos said in his prepared remarks, \u201cthat we don\u2019t accept violence as the means of defending ideas. \u201d It was a moment perhaps reminiscent of the Good Friday Agreement that ended the conflict in Northern Ireland or the Oslo Accords that promised peace in the Middle East. And it was an image that generations of Colombians had yearned to see on their soil: A sitting president shaking the hands of the very rebel leader whom government forces had once hunted in the mountains, as the two sides pledged a future of peaceful politics. \u201cLet no one doubt that we will now pursue politics without weapons,\u201d said Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, the top commander of the FARC, offering an apology to the war\u2019s victims. Soon, the choice will be in the hands of the Colombian people, who have the last word. Mr. Santos, who as defense minister ordered offensives against Mr. Londo\u00f1o\u2019s forces, has called for a referendum vote on Sunday to ratify the accord he has signed. Polls indicate that it will coast to victory by a wide   margin. The FARC\u2019s war against the government marked one of the first   insurgencies in Latin America, a struggle that would inspire guerrilla movements from Cuba to Nicaragua. While the conflict gradually diminished, the group\u2019s fighters, in the tents and hammocks of their   continued to preach Marxist armed struggle until early this year. \u201cThis was like the stars that have burned out years ago  \u2014   but still you can see their light for many years afterward,\u201d said Bernard Aronson, the American diplomat who worked as an intermediary during the talks. \u201cThis is what the FARC had become. \u201d The war tore the social fabric of Colombia. Decades of fighting brought the rise of paramilitary groups who massacred civilians and burned villages. The FARC eventually turned to the profitable cocaine trade to finance its insurgency, while shaking down rural people and terrorizing city dwellers with kidnappings and killings. All told, some 220, 000 people lost their lives, and more than five million were displaced. Many argued that the time had come at last to end generations of unrest. \u201cWho could oppose that people go back to using the land? That there are no more children in war? That the mines be removed?\u201d said Armando Benedetti, a Colombian senator and longtime supporter of the peace deal. Yet the agreement has faced stiff criticism, most notably from Mr. Santos\u2019 predecessor as president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe. Mr. Uribe is widely credited with the crackdown that brought the FARC to the negotiating table. He has since become the leader of the movement to sink the deal through the referendum, saying that the government had gone too easy on the guerrillas and calling Mr. Santos a \u201ctraitor. \u201d \u201cWith these agreements, there is neither justice nor truth for the victims,\u201d said Mr. Uribe, who is now an opposition senator in Congress, in a Twitter post. In coming months the FARC will hand over arms to United Nations inspectors, beginning a process in which they will begin a life as ordinary Colombians. In return, the country will agree to a \u201ctransitional justice\u201d system in which, according to Mr. Santos,    soldiers will be granted amnesty or given reduced sentences for crimes they committed. The rebels held what they called the 10th Conference last week, where many began to plan their future. Guerrilla fighters donned   and attended outdoor concerts as they voted to end their insurgency. Many saw it as their first step toward a life after their rebellion. The process of reconciliation will continue in Colombia, long after the signing ceremony and even the referendum, as the country pulls together. Yet the survivors must live with their memories of war. There are those like Yolanda Perea, who as an    in 1997 was living in the village of La Pava when a guerrilla entered her home, which had no door, walked past her five siblings and her grandfather, and raped her with a gun pointed to her head. Ms. Perea did not know she had become pregnant until another guerrilla beat her and she had a miscarriage. Days later, she said, several more guerrillas arrived and fatally shot her mother. Ms. Perea eventually had two children. She lives in Medell\u00edn working with a nongovernmental organization that protects women\u2019s rights. She is planning a \u201cyes\u201d vote for the referendum. \u201cI don\u2019t win anything if I continue to hate,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to vote yes because peace depends on each of us. There are more of us who are good, and we simply have to keep fighting for a quiet country for our children and grandchildren. \u201d The accord was celebrated in other cities around the world. At a gathering in Times Square, David Oliveros, a    college student from Bogot\u00e1 who is studying biochemistry at Columbia, choked up as he described the peace agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve never lived in a country in peace, without war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment I\u2019ve waited for all of my life. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562243.3856359}
