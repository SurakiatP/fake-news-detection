F#%k me Dave, I feel like I\u2019m on LSD. \u2013 email from a reader \\nAbout 12 years ago I was chatting with the friend who dragged me feet-first into the \u201cdark side\u201d and the world of precious metals in 2001. We were discussing Eastman Kodak\u2019s likely demise a few years before the Company went into the tank. We knew a 2008-type event was going to happen at some point. At the time, we said that eventually we would see events occur in this country that would blow our minds. Mind you, this was a couple years after Enron, 9/11 (which we knew was a Government false-flag operation), Bernie Madoff and the U.S.\u2019 illegal invasion based on admitted (eventually) lies propagated by Colin Powell. \\nI have to say, the way in which Hillary Clinton\u2019s criminal organization has gained complete control over the political and justice system and the media in this country is truly mind-blowing. Hillary is a criminally insane sociopath. That point is unequivocally inarguable. But the true Devil in her organization is John Podesta, who\u2019s persona has been made available to anyone willing to spend time reading just a portion of the \u201cPodesta\u201d emails given to us by Wikileaks. There are 691,200 seconds in 8 days. FBI Director Comey reviewed 650,000 emails in 8 days? An email per second? Americans aren\u2019t stupid! \u2013 tweet from Bernard Kerik, ex-NYPD Commissioner \\nIf anyone knows about corrupt organizations, it\u2019s an NYPD Commissioner \u2013 the NYPD being one of the most internally corrupt law enforcement organizations around. It\u2019s great when ex-insiders blow the whistle on others when the agenda of those others do not fit that of the ex-insider\u2019s \u201cteam.\u201d \\nThe manner in which Jim Comey has folded is beyond stunning. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anyone who cares about this matter who believes that Comey was able to parse through over 650,000 emails in 8 days in order to determine that Hillary did not commit \u201cintent\u201d in her email escapades. \\nHillary\u2019s email trail made available to the public is a fascinating trail of criminality. I doubt James Patterson, John Grisham and Robert Ludlum could combine resources and make up a crime tale as intriguing as Hillary\u2019s. \\nThe evidence piling up against Hillary is breathtaking. According to the recently released Podesta emails, the Clinton Foundation has been used for everything except funding charitable causes, including paying for Chelsea\u2019s wedding and funding Chelsea\u2019s husband\u2019s failed hedge fund. If I were not able to laugh at this insanity, I\u2019d be suicidal\u2026 \\nI think most Americans who are being honest with themselves are fully aware of the fact that Hillary Clinton is likely the most corrupt politician in U.S. history. If anything, the election of Hillary Clinton is a symptom that the end is near for the United States. \\nI am convinced that we are at a pivotal moment in American history, and if the American people willingly choose Hillary Clinton it will be an indication that there is zero hope for the future of this nation. \\nThe above quote is an excerpt from a must-read essay written by Michael Snyder: I Just Lost All Faith In Our Deeply Corrupt Legal System\u2026 \\nI urge everyone to read Snyder\u2019s commentary.'"}, "time": 1742563676.6665363}
