The Americans\u2019 traditional rival in the event, France, was second, and Australia third. The gold was Phelps\u2019s 23rd medal: 19 golds, 2 silvers and 2 bronzes. The final time was 3:09. 92. Phelps, who wasn\u2019t added to the relay team until race day, swam the second leg for the Americans, taking over from Caeleb Dressel in second place behind France and swimming into the lead. His split time was 47. 12, which his coach Bob Bowman said was one of his   fastest. He took the lead from his French counterpart Fabien Gilot after a turn that Bowman described as \u201cprobably the best turn that might have ever been done. \u201d Ryan Held and Nathan Adrian brought the U. S. home Adrian\u2019s split was an even better 46. 97. Phelps retired after the 2012 Games but decided to return in part because of disappointment with how the American men swam in the 4x100 relay at the 2013 world championships, losing to France. The relay was the most unpredictable event of the night in swimming, with Australia, France, the United States and Russia all having claims to a gold medal. France and the United States split the last two Olympic gold medals, with Yannick Agnel of France outdueling Ryan Lochte in the anchor leg to win four years ago. Phelps was on both of those American teams.'"}, "time": 1742564286.2254357}
