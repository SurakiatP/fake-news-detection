There is hope and healing after abortion. https:  .   \u2014   March for Life (@March_for_Life) May 12, 2017,  A Renewed Mother\u2019s Day: Mothers Day History and Real Meaning  https:  .   \u2014   Fr. Frank Pavone (@frfrankpavone) May 11, 2017,  Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, also serves as pastoral director of Rachel\u2019s Vineyard  \u2014   the world\u2019s largest ministry for healing after abortion. Pavone tells Breitbart News he is in touch daily with women who mourn their lost motherhood following abortion. \u201dOur society must not settle for leaving women who face unplanned pregnancy no hope but abortion.\u201d https:  .   \u2014   March for Life (@March_for_Life) May 10, 2017,  \u201cMother\u2019s Day is for so many of them a time of particular pain, but also a time of particular healing,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are many sentimental trappings of Mother\u2019s Day  \u2014   and these, of course are nothing bad  \u2014   the cards and flowers, the hearts and   greetings. But the woman who started Mother\u2019s Day came to feel that sentimentality had obscured its original meaning. \u201d Pavone also provides pastoral leadership for the Silent No More Awareness Campaign, an effort to mobilize those who testify to the pain they have experienced through abortion. He relates the story of Anna Jarvis, the founder of the original Mother\u2019s Day holiday, to those who are helping others heal after abortion: After the Civil War, Anna Jarvis, an activist from West Virginia, wanted to honor her late mother for her good work in her lifetime. Anna\u2019s mother had started mothers clubs to help lower infant mortality. Anna carried on her mother\u2019s work. With the outbreak of the Civil War, she created mothers\u2019 clubs that tended to wounded soldiers on both sides. These concrete and organized actions of mothers involved hard work and sustained commitment geared toward saving lives, and often marked by the pain of losing those lives. In a sense, then, the current holocaust of abortion in which we are living, and the pain of so many mothers who have lost their own children, can be an occasion to recover deeper and more original meanings of Mother\u2019s Day. Mothers can come together  \u2014   as so many do through Rachel\u2019s Vineyard and Silent No More  \u2014   to strengthen one another to face the pain abortion brings, to walk the journey of healing, and to commit themselves to save as many lives as possible from this scourge of our day. And in that sense Mother\u2019s Day becomes a holiday for all of us to renew our commitment to defend mothers and their children from something that is taking far more lives than war or disease has ever taken. On Mother\u2019s Day,   leaders also remember women and girls who have continued an unplanned pregnancy and offered their babies for adoption.

Sometimes we are praised for our generosity, but we know that the gift is all for the parents. Although adoption requires a trusting leap into the unknown and a conscious acceptance of any number of difficulties, the return in joy is dizzying. Often, though my daughter has been with me for nine years, I look at her and I am freshly struck with the utter unlikelihood of her person being mine to guard.
