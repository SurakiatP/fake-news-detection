According to government sources, Facebook is even assisting Pakistan in removing \u201cblasphemous\u201d content. [Late last week, government officials in Pakistan informed the Islamabad High Court that \u201calmost 85 percent\u201d of \u201cblasphemous\u201d material on Facebook had been taken down at the request of the government.  Facebook has yet to publicly confirm or deny this claim from the Pakistani government. However, earlier this month, Facebook  \u2014   which claims to be \u201cfounded\u201d on \u201cprinciples of free expression,\u201d dispatched a delegation to Pakistan to address the government\u2019s demand for religious censorship. At the time of writing, Facebook did not reply to an inquiry from Breitbart News asking the company if they had removed \u201cblasphemous\u201d material to satisfy Pakistan. Pakistan, a   country which once harboured Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden within its borders, recently launched a crackdown on social media blasphemy. The country\u2019s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif has ordered authorities to take urgent steps to remove blasphemous content on social media and apprehend those who post it. Last week, three Pakistani bloggers were arrested on suspicion of blasphemy, and had their laptops seized. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. Pakistan wants social media companies to help identify anonymous posters of blapshemous content, and has announced that it will seek the extradition of any Pakistanis who post blasphemous content from abroad. International affairs magazine The Diplomat has branded the   crackdown a \u201cwar on atheism. \u201d Meanwhile, on Twitter, a hashtag calling for the execution of one of the arrested \u201cblapshemers,\u201d \u2018#HangAyazNizami,\u2019 trended in Pakistan as Muslim users took to the platform to call for the blood of heretics.  Fuck with freedom of speech hang this fucker asap. \ud83d\ude0f #HangAyazNizami,  \u2014   Sardar Waqar (@Engrr_vicky) March 25, 2017,  Call us terrorist or extremist or what everbut he must be hanged #hangayaznizami,  \u2014   Daniyal Ahmed (@daniyalaahmed) March 25, 2017,  He must be drag in the streets then hanged #HangAyazNizami,  \u2014   Nida Ahmed (@nidaa214) March 25, 2017,  Western Twitter users reacted strongly against the trend. Some users pointed out the hypocrisy of Twitter allowing these open calls for religious murder on their platform, while cracking down on peaceful western conservative users. Dear @twitter Those posting pro #hangayazNizami tweets are far more dangerous than Milo. https:  .   \u2014   Christina Sommers (@CHSommers) March 27, 2017,  Thousands of muslims who AREN\u2019T terrorists want to hang a blogger for \u201dblasphemy\u201d and some still want mass Muslim migration  #HangAyazNizami,  \u2014   Joseph  (@JosephBrowno) March 27, 2017,  Those tweeting #HangAyazNizami for \u201dblasphemy\u201d are insecure, petty, weak little cowards. @Jack  @Twitter should take note.  \u2014   Maajid (@MaajidNawaz) March 26, 2017,  See this hashtag #HangAyazNizami  learn what ordinary Pakistanis want done to a secular blogger now in serious peril. This is NOT a fringe. https:  .   \u2014   Ali A. Rizvi (@aliamjadrizvi) March 26, 2017,  I\u2019m wondering if prominent Muslim voices such as @lsarsour will publicly condemn this #HangAyazNizami, or if she\u2019ll completely ignore it.  \u2014   Child Of Kekistan (@ChildofKekistan) March 27, 2017,  Twitter has yet to respond to an enquiry from Breitbart News, which asked the company why calls for violence against a blogger remain on the platform, and whether such posts violate the platform\u2019s guidelines on \u201chate content. \u201d You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter and add him on Facebook.
