As a byproduct of the tragedy, scientists have gained access to more than 100, 000 square miles of seafloor mapped at a level of detail that provides a rare look at the ocean\u2019s geological processes. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible trove of data,\u201d said Millard F. Coffin, a marine geophysicist from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania in Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in this part of the Indian Ocean for   years and over many voyages in the eastern Indian Ocean I\u2019ve never seen this level of resolution. \u201d Dr. Coffin worked with a group of about 10 scientists from Geoscience Australia, the national geosciences agency in Australia, to analyze data from the search. They were given access to   sonar information collected on ships, and data obtained by remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater drones. The information was provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which led the search. \u201cWhen we look at these data, we\u2019re constantly keeping in mind that we wouldn\u2019t have this data if it weren\u2019t for a terrible tragedy,\u201d Dr. Coffin said. He and his colleagues published a summary of their findings on Wednesday in the journal EOS. Previous satellite data provided scientists with information about the Indian Ocean at a resolution of about five square kilometers, or about two square miles. With the instruments from the search ships, they have collected information at a resolution of meters, and in some locations they have used remote operating vehicles and underwater autonomous vehicles to gain detail on the scale of centimeters. The search has helped create   maps of the ocean floor that reveal its topographical complexity and will allow researchers to further investigate unique features like the oceanic plateau called Broken Ridge, and its   Diamantina Escarpment. The Flight 370 search also provided information about tectonic and volcanic activity, Dr. Coffin said. The team plans to release more detailed looks into its findings later in the year, and the full data set from the search will be made available in the middle of the year. Walter H. F. Smith, a geophysicist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the hunt for the lost jetliner highlighted how little we know about the oceans. In a paper that was also published Wednesday in the journal EOS, he and his colleagues explained how common unmapped areas of ocean are. \u201cThere are all kinds of things you can\u2019t do if you don\u2019t know the shape of the ocean bottom, or don\u2019t know it properly,\u201d Dr. Smith said. The consequences of not knowing, he said, can hinder how experts predict tsunamis, understand ocean currents, make climate forecasts, study marine life and search for missing planes. Previous studies have suggested that only 8 percent of the world\u2019s oceans have been mapped, meaning that a ship measured an area\u2019s depth and recorded it in a scientific database. Before Flight 370\u2019s disappearance, only 5 percent of the southeast Indian Ocean had been mapped, Dr. Smith said. To figure out how often people fly over unmapped parts of the world\u2019s oceans, Dr. Smith and his colleagues compared data on mapped and unmapped segments of the world\u2019s ocean segments with a database of commercial airline routes. They found that about 60 percent of all commercial flights that cross over the ocean travel over waters with unmeasured depths. The longest contiguous route over unmapped ocean was from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport in China, a journey over more than 1, 200 nautical miles of unmapped ocean. \u201cI wanted people to realize that it\u2019s not just Malaysia Airlines straying into the southeast Indian Ocean where it shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when your aircraft is exactly where it\u2019s supposed to be, it might be over unknown ocean. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562176.5456257}
