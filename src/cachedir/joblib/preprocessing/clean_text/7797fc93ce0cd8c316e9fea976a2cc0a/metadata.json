She helped direct teams of F. B. I. agents to New York to collect evidence, set up secure command posts in the streets so agents could discuss classified information, and alerted the digital forensics, fingerprint and facial recognition experts she manages in Quantico, Va. site of the F. B. I. academy and its lab. By the next day, she and her team had played a crucial role in identifying Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man charged with planting the bomb in Chelsea along with a second, unexploded device. \u201cWe pulled out all the stops,\u201d said Ms. Hess, who as head of the bureau\u2019s science and technology branch oversees more than 6, 000 F. B. I. employees. Inside the F. B. I. women in particular look up to Ms. Hess, and not just because they have nicknamed her the \u201crocket scientist\u201d with a degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Purdue University. She is also the first woman to head the science branch  \u2014   one of few female agents commanding such an important job at the F. B. I. a clubby agency where men are more predominant in senior positions than they were even three years ago. Ms. Hess, 50, put it simply: \u201cThere is a lack of women in leadership roles. \u201d Today at the F. B. I. women hold 12 percent of 220 senior agent positions, including nine who run field offices in places like Los Angeles Oklahoma City Louisville, Ky. and Knoxville, Tenn. That is a decline from 2013, when women held about 20 percent of senior agent jobs and 15 women ran field offices. \u201cIt seems to be going backwards,\u201d said Janice K. Fedarcyk, now retired, who ran the New York office, with about 2, 000 employees, from 2010 to 2012. \u201cThey need to do something to turn that around. \u2019\u2019 James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, has described the lack of women  \u2014   and also minorities  \u2014   in the F. B. I. as a serious problem that can undermine investigations and keep the agency out of touch with the communities it serves. Of the bureau\u2019s 13, 523 agents over all, 2, 683  \u2014   or about 20 percent  \u2014   are women. About 83 percent of the agents over all are white. \u201cThe big challenge we\u2019ve been confronting over the last two years is, how do we get women and people of color\u201d to join the F. B. I. Mr. Comey said last Sunday at a conference of police chiefs in San Diego. \u201cThat\u2019s been our big trouble, and I\u2019ve described it as a crisis. \u201d In response, the F. B. I. put a plan in place to try to increase the overall number of female agents to 33 percent. The bureau will also soon start providing field offices with recruitment data, something it had never done. That will allow the F. B. I. to track where it has successfully recruited employees and perhaps tie the data to performance reviews and bonuses. \u201cOur ability to be believed is at risk,\u201d Mr. Comey said in a speech earlier this year. \u201cThe F. B. I. must be able to stand on any corner in the U. S. or before any jury and be believed. \u201d The F. B. I. has long struggled to promote women. It was not until after J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s death in 1972 that women were accepted as agents  \u2014   the people at the agency who carry guns, run investigations and are at the heart of the F. B. I. \u2019s macho culture. It took another two decades before Burdena G. Pasenelli, known as Birdie, was appointed the first female agent to run a field office. Her assignment? Anchorage, which was not then, or now, at the center of the action. But for women in the bureau, Ms. Pasenelli, who died this year, was a trailblazer. \u201cIt opened the door for a lot of women to think about the possibilities,\u201d said Stephanie Douglas, who in 2012 became the first woman to run the F. B. I. \u2019s national security branch. Ms. Douglas, who worked with prosecutors to investigate the destruction of C. I. A. videotapes that depicted the torture of terrorism suspects overseas, retired in 2013. F. B. I. officials say they cannot explain completely the step backward for women in leadership roles at the bureau, but they say retirements and the timing of openings are partly responsible. David Schlendorf, assistant director for the F. B. I. \u2019s human resources division, called it a \u201cworrisome\u201d trend, although not intractable. \u201cI am optimistic we can do better,\u201d said Valerie Parlave, Mr. Schlendorf\u2019s boss, who in 2013 became the first woman to run the Washington field office. Women cite three important reasons so few of them are in the F. B. I. \u2019s senior ranks. First, the F. B. I. \u2019s path to promotion is often less appealing to women, more than a dozen former and current female agents said. F. B. I. agents can be transferred at a moment\u2019s notice, which often requires leaving a family behind. Traditionally, that has meant that men in the bureau have to uproot without their children and spouses for long stretches of time, a sacrifice women may be less willing to make. Ms. Douglas, who does not have children, said that she once moved from San Francisco to Washington in four days and that she relocated four times from 2005 to 2013. Each time a call came, she feared that if she said no, she might not get another chance. \u201cThe bureau is incredibly competitive,\u201d Ms. Douglas said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take advantage of that opportunity, somebody else will. \u201d Second, women say the F. B. I. does not have enough   female role models or mentors. Although women hold senior agent jobs, a woman has never been in charge of a large F. B. I. operational division like counterterrorism, which in the    world has been dominated by men who went on to bigger jobs  \u2014   including the F. B. I. \u2019s No. 2 position, deputy director. A woman has never been deputy director, or director. Ms. Fedarcyk, the former head of the New York field office who was also the top agent in charge of terrorism in Los Angeles and managed the bureau\u2019s effort to track terrorism financing, said her success was, in part, because people took an interest in her work and helped her along the way. \u201cI had a great career,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of different reasons why that is the case. Some women don\u2019t want to take that next step. Some guys don\u2019t want to take that next step. I was fortunate coming up in the bureau. I had strong mentors. \u201d A third problem, women say, is that far fewer women apply for top F. B. I. jobs than men. For every dozen or so applicants for a senior job, Ms. Hess said, only one or two are women. In part, that is because there are fewer women in the agency to begin with, but women also shy away from applying for top F. B. I. jobs, Ms. Hess said, for the same reason that many men do: They see sitting behind a desk, even with more seniority and pay, as inferior to what many consider the dream job of agent  \u2014   working the streets, meeting with informants, making cases and putting criminals in jail. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason you come into the bureau,\u201d said Ms. Hess, who once worked violent crimes, gangs and drugs and briefly ran F. B. I. counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan. \u201cNot to push paper. \u201d This month, Ms. Hess will take over the office in Louisville, the eighth move in her career. At the F. B. I. there have been many challenges for women. Female agents have repeatedly sued the F. B. I. for sexual harassment and discrimination. This year, a former agent accused her male   in the Denver office of behaving inappropriately and making disparaging comments. According to the lawsuit, a male agent was overheard talking about a female colleague: \u201cI hope she quits. She can stay home in the kitchen. \u201d Beverly Andress, who joined the agency in 1983 and retired in 2006, recalled that she was often introduced as a \u201cfemale agent\u201d rather than just an agent. \u201cYou have to have a good sense of humor,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a man\u2019s world. \u201d F. B. I. officials say that if the numbers are looked at as an average over the last decade, the agency has a better record of women in senior agent positions  \u2014   about 16 percent  \u2014   than other federal law enforcement agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Only the Secret Service had a slightly higher percentage of women in senior agent positions. Female agents say they will know the F. B. I. has made progress when a woman is finally put in charge of counterterrorism, criminal investigations, counterintelligence or is appointed as deputy director. For now, the stars in those divisions are overwhelmingly male. \u201cWe are playing \u201d said Voviette Morgan, a senior agent who runs the bureau\u2019s internal investigations section and is a seasoned counterterrorism investigator. \u201cIn 2016, I hate the fact we say firsts. \u201d \u201cWe are behind the curve,\u201d Ms. Morgan added. \u201cThere is no doubt about it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562461.834959}
