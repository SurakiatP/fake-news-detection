While the next nationwide elections are not until 2018, Republicans have grown fearful that these voters are recoiling from what they see as lamentable conditions in Washington: a government entirely in Republican hands that has failed to deliver on fundamental goals like overhauling the health care system. Early missteps by President Trump and congressional leaders have weighed heavily on voters from the party\u2019s more affluent wing, anchored in    suburbs around major cities in the South and Midwest. Never beloved in these precincts, Mr. Trump appears to be struggling to maintain support from certain voters who backed him last year mainly as a way of defeating Hillary Clinton. Interviews with   voters in four suburban districts  \u2014   in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and New Jersey  \u2014   revealed a sour outlook on the party. These voters, mainly white professionals, say they expected far more in the way of results by now, given the Republican grip on power in the capital. In opinion polls, they consistently give Mr. Trump mediocre approval ratings, even as he remains solidly popular with   whites. In the past,   presidents have suffered grievous losses in midterm elections, when their party\u2019s voters have stayed home while the opposition party has marched to the barricades. Former President Barack Obama saw Democrats lose 63 House seats in 2010 after Republicans and disaffected independents stampeded to the polls and grumbling Democrats did not. It is too early to say if the same dynamic is afflicting Mr. Trump. But already, Republicans have strained to prop up their candidates in a pair of special House elections in the areas around Atlanta and Wichita, Kan. both in districts that have voted overwhelmingly Republican in past congressional races. Republicans spent nearly $100, 000 in   ads boosting Ron Estes, a candidate in Kansas, who won a relatively narrow victory Tuesday night as turnout from the party\u2019s voters slumped. Wary national Democrats invested little money in the race, prompting criticism from activists seeking to fight Mr. Trump\u2019s party on every possible front. Republicans may face a tougher test next week in Georgia, where both parties have poured millions into contesting the seat vacated by Tom Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s new health and human services secretary. At a   shopping mall outside Atlanta, Eric Riehm, 48, said he was beginning to question the point of casting his ballot for Republicans. \u201cThe vote seems to matter less and less, because nothing can be done, just like repealing Obamacare,\u201d said Mr. Riehm, who works in information technology sales and voted for Mr. Trump. That malaise cuts across regional lines: In the New Jersey district held by Representative Leonard Lance, a Republican, Joe Boyle, 61, said he took a dim view of Mr. Trump but still hoped he would turn things around. Mr. Boyle, who said he usually votes Republican, faulted the party for failing to \u201cdo the homework\u201d on health care, and criticized lawmakers for focusing on their own interests instead of forging bipartisan agreements. \u201cIt\u2019s all about \u2018me,\u2019 not about the better good of the overall population,\u201d said Mr. Boyle, who recently retired as a marketing executive at Johnson  Johnson. Of Mr. Trump, he added: \u201cHe\u2019s a mess. \u201d Where Democratic activists have flocked to   races, hustling to volunteer, donate money and quickly cast their ballots in   periods, Republicans have seen no comparable energy on their side. They have taken special measures to drum up interest: In Kansas, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas held a   rally to draw attention to the race, and Mr. Trump praised Mr. Estes on Twitter on Tuesday morning. But in an illustration of the rising frustration among    Republicans, Mr. Cruz received his loudest ovation when he rebuked his own party. \u201cWe have a Republican president, we have a Republican House, we have a Republican Senate  \u2014   how about we act like it!\u201d he demanded. Mr. Estes ultimately won by 7 points, compared with a nearly   victory margin last fall for the district\u2019s previous congressman, Mike Pompeo, who now leads the C. I. A. And the enthusiasm gap between the parties was on vivid display: Mr. Estes won 62 percent fewer votes than Mr. Pompeo did last fall, while the Democratic vote was only 32 percent lower than in November. Should Republican voters remain so demoralized  \u2014   and Democrats so fired up  \u2014   it could imperil dozens of congressional seats that are usually safe. Midterm elections typically turn on which party is more enthusiastic about sending a message in the past special elections have served as political omens, like when former Senator Scott Brown\u2019s upset win in Massachusetts in 2010 foreshadowed a building conservative wave. Republican anxieties run deeper than just the House. The gloomy environment has hampered their recruiting in a number of   Senate seats, alarming the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, according to Republican officials who have spoken to him, who insisted on anonymity to describe those conversations. Joel McElhannon, a Republican strategist in Georgia, said intraparty wounds from the presidential race remained raw in areas Republicans badly need to win, making it difficult for them to turn out their voters. \u201cIt makes it hard to energize the broader Republican base when there are still these unresolved conflicts,\u201d said Mr. McElhannon, predicting: \u201cYou\u2019ll see it in various suburbanized districts throughout the country. \u201d Far from Atlanta, along the shoreline of Lake Minnetonka, Minn.  \u2014   where the accents could scarcely be more different, but the taste in   cars and   politics is the same  \u2014   voters in Representative Erik Paulsen\u2019s   district voiced a similar sense of unease. Mr. Paulsen has been   easily since managing a victory the year Mr. Obama was first elected president. But Hillary Clinton won his district by 10 points in November, making it terrain that could turn competitive if centrist voters recoil from the G. O. P. That would mean a   insurrection from the type of voters strolling along Lake Street in Wayzata or dropping off their dogs at the Lulu and Luigi grooming parlor, as Jackie Carley did with Tiny Bubbles and Viggo, two of her rescues. Ms. Carley, a   moderate, said she would be more likely to support a congressman who would slow or halt the president\u2019s agenda. \u201cI\u2019m a Minnesota person so I don\u2019t want to be rude, but I\u2019m not a fan,\u201d Ms. Carley, a     said of Mr. Trump. Others were less diplomatic. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess,\u201d said Gretchen Gilbertson, 51, a    mother out walking her own dog, Pancake. \u201cCongress can\u2019t get anything done, and our president is a buffoon. \u201d Ms. Gilbertson vowed to do whatever she could to send Mr. Trump a message of disapproval in next year\u2019s election. Paul Anderson, a state senator from nearby Plymouth, Minn. said voters there would judge their congressman on his own record. But for Mr. Paulsen to win   Mr. Anderson suggested, he would probably \u201chave to separate himself at some point from Trump. \u201d It remains to be seen if Democrats can fully exploit the turbulent environment. They hoped last fall that Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity would drag down   Republican candidates across the country, but the party won full control of government. And Democrats may face a tricky balancing act if the explosion of energy on the left collides with the native sensitivities of the    districts they aim to win. Representative Josh Gottheimer, a moderate Democrat who captured a   seat in the New Jersey suburbs last November, said he believed even some conservatives would be \u201c  to voting for Democrats, with the right approach. \u201d \u201cYou have to find a very     approach and one that is not ideologically rigid on either side,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said. \u201cPeople are so fired up on the left, too, you have to make sure you are responsive there as well. \u201d In Georgia, the Democrat running for Congress, Jon Ossoff, has tried to walk that line, promising in ads to check Mr. Trump\u2019s power, while also pledging to cut wasteful spending. He faces a fractious array of Republicans in an open primary on Tuesday. While the district easily   Mr. Price, Mr. Trump barely carried it against Mrs. Clinton. Strolling briskly past Banana Republic and Orvis storefronts, Helen Thompson, 72, said she was dismayed that Republican disorder had endangered the seat. \u201cI think the Republican Party needs to get together  \u2014   they need to get their    together,\u201d she said. \u201cI love Donald Trump, but I just wish he\u2019d keep his mouth shut sometimes and I wish he\u2019d listen to the people who know what they\u2019re doing. \u201d Ms. Thompson, who worked at a brokerage firm before retiring, said she had voted early in the special election for Dan Moody, a former state senator, from a throng of candidates that includes Karen Handel, a former county commissioner in Fulton County, and Judson Hill, a former state senator. Other voters were less committed: Edward Holben, 62, an engineer on his way into Whole Foods, said he was not following the race closely but expected to vote Republican. Yet Mr. Holben said he was turned off by partisan rancor in Washington, and unsure of Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to enact major legislation. He called the attempt to restructure the health care system so inept he was unsure Republicans were ever determined to pass it. \u201cYou want a   rating?\u201d Mr. Holben asked of the Congress. \u201cHow about a  ?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562560.4728117}
