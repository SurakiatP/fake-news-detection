It calls to mind the panting tongues, bulging eyeballs, springing hearts and   ears of Looney Toons characters. Or those mewling, suggestive,    selfies that people post to social media to elicit precisely that   reaction  \u2014   a type of image commonly known as a \u201cthirst trap. \u201d \u201cThirst\u201d doesn\u2019t just want something it makes an unsightly spectacle of a clueless, grasping, gaping need. It encroaches on boundaries and intrudes on others\u2019 space, jostling   and good taste out of the way. The more commonplace the word has become over the past few years, the more it has come to describe a condition that exists on a very wide spectrum. The guy who eagerly favorites your every social post is thirsty. The   who\u2019s always fishing for the boss\u2019s praise is thirsty. The brand that tries very hard to be cool is thirsty. The   Twitter\u2019 \u2019u200b\u2019u200bincontinent politician is thirsty. The acquaintance who\u2019s always suggesting you get together for brunch is thirsty  \u2014   or maybe you\u2019re just judgmental and mean. There\u2019s always been something slightly derogatory about the way we speak of a thirst for wealth, fame, power or attention. The poet William Cowper wrote about \u201cLow ambition and the thirst of praise. \u201d Byron wrote about \u201cA thirst for gold. The beggar\u2019s vice. \u201d Chekhov wrote about \u201cthe thirst for powerful sensations,\u201d and Madame de Sta\u00ebl wrote about how \u201cgenius inspires this thirst for fame. \u201d At this point, even the modern version of the word has been absorbed into the lexicon so thoroughly that it hardly stands out as slang anymore. Its usage has become barely distinguishable from its classical applications  \u2014   but now it has an added layer of contempt, suggesting that the condition it describes has only grown worse or that we\u2019ve grown less tolerant of it. Lately, in fact, the notion of thirst has edged into an inhibiting kind of judgment. It has morphed into a discouraging,   meme  \u2014   a potent means of condemning any kind of overreach. Most of that condemnation is richly deserved. In a recent column, Frank Bruni called out the most parched legislator of the moment, Devin Nunes, who was described by a source as \u201can overeager goofball\u201d and a bumbling   oblivious to \u201cthe line between ingratiating and stupid,\u201d who jangled John Boehner\u2019s nerves with his \u201cindiscriminate pep\u201d and \u201cconstant bumming of his cigarettes. \u201d Of course, Nunes pales in comparison to the giant sucking sound that is the person whose approval he most thirsts for  \u2014   our current president, whose every action seems driven by the need to prove to others how smart, powerful, rich and sexy he is. From   every square inch of his life to bragging to a   television personality about sexual assault, from tweeting rancorously about \u201cS. N. L. \u201d at all hours (Paul Krugman: \u201cOne look at his Twitter account is enough to show that victory has done nothing to slake his thirst for ego gratification\u201d) to marrying women ever younger than him who choose to live farther and farther from him, Donald Trump is driven by a thirst for approval so powerful and desperate that it has grossed out much of the nation and freaked out much of the world. \u201cThirst\u201d was first added to the Urban Dictionary in 2003, but its use hit its first great peak sometime around 2014, the year Diet Coke introduced the thirstiest ad campaign in history. One ad\u2019s tagline seemed to suggest any number of strange things: that drinking soda was like snorting cocaine, that the average Diet Coke drinker was prone to using sex to advance her career, maybe even that she was plainly desperate and needed to be reined in. (\u201cBe ambitious, not thirsty. You\u2019re on Diet Coke. \u201d) That line was the epitome of thirst, flailing haplessly to connect a soda brand to a buzzword. The campaign was roundly mocked and quickly pulled, and it made me wonder if Dos Equis\u2019s   \u201cThe Most Interesting Man in the World\u201d campaign  \u2014   \u201cStay thirsty, my friends\u201d  \u2014   was sincere or stealthily mocking the least interesting men in the world. In December 2014, Jezebel posted a list of 100 very thirsty people, moments and things under the headline \u201cThe Unquenchable Year,\u201d rooting out clueless desperation wherever it dwelt: Aaron Sorkin, bachelor parties, Kris Jenner, Kim   journalism as a discipline. Reading it was like having your third eye pried open while cycling through Plutchik\u2019s Wheel of Emotions, only with all the positive feelings grayed out. Two years later, \u201cthirst\u201d remains with us as the mot juste for these and other people, moments and things  \u2014   and the evidence of that thirst has only grown more undeniable. It lingers in mirror and car selfies, in Nunes\u2019s midnight White House runs and in Paul Ryan\u2019s Beanie Boo face. (Thirst is not, for the record, partisan: Consider Bernie Sanders\u2019s courting of millennial voters last year.) And yet, whenever I come across the word, it troubles me longer than it should. Something about it rankles. Why thirst, precisely, and not some other basic human condition resulting from need? Maybe it has something to do with the things we thirst for  \u2014   things like approval, attention, affection, recognition all the interdependent needs. The things we deride as being \u201cthirsty\u201d are the things that lack value in the eyes of the macho,   American individualist, so they invite macho,   derision. Hunger, for instance, is described as a presence, a motivating fire in the belly, but thirst is derided as a girly lack. Entitlement plays a part, too. We \u201chunger\u201d for success, because we approve of success. Hunger is associated with desire, whereas thirst is associated with need. But I also tend to think that it\u2019s because \u201cthirst\u201d gets at an epistemological problem: a crisis of being, or how to be, in the world as it is now. It puts you into an unsettling double bind. It reframes a basic,   need as a moral, social, aesthetic and personal failure. Our strange attachment to the word is hinted at by the fact that a global water crisis is in full flower, the world is increasingly parched, World Water Day was commemorated just last month  \u2014   and yet the word \u201cthirsty\u201d is doused in judgment. Is it because \u201cthirst\u201d will kill you first? \u201cThirsty\u201d is a unisex   but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not gendered. A man is thirsty when he fails to cloak his libido or his instincts in a perfectly calibrated mix of empathy and chill. A woman is thirsty when she fails to cloak her emotional needs or insecurities behind a posture of detachment. \u201cThirsty\u201d reinforces gender stereotypes while coolly pretending not to. It expresses our ambivalent relationship with desire  \u2014   our constant negation of it, our vigilant policing of it. It gets at who is allowed to want things, and in what way we are allowed to want them. Trump\u2019s arrant thirstiness stands in particularly glaring contrast to Obama\u2019s impeccable chill. This resembles every other time the tyranny of cool has been rebelled against. These things go in cycles: A Romantic eruption of feeling tends to follow in the wake of Classical reserve. Frank emotiveness and sensitivity become culturally sanctioned again, emo comes back and we enter a supposedly more feminine cycle. Only this time, rather than usher in a more frankly emotional phase, we\u2019ve ushered in something suppressive  \u2014   the total denial of feeling, of experience. It\u2019s not idealism in the air around our leadership or any kind of desire (greed excepted) it\u2019s a lack, a void, a deficit. I recoil as much as the next person from the narcissistic behaviors \u201cthirst\u201d takes down. But I just as often find myself recoiling from its inhibiting effects. As Ana\u00efs Nin wrote: \u201cSomething is always born of excess. Great art was born of great terrors, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities, and it always balances them. \u201d Nothing is born out of deficiency. Nin was reviled throughout her life and afterward for writing candidly about her desires  \u2014   something few women are allowed to do without being branded an open wound  \u2014   and was only recently divested of her status as one of the thirstiest women of the 20th century. (Wanting, of course, is the impetus for getting, and we\u2019re still very selective about who gets to do that.) But after decades of enshrining power, greed, lust and other   desires as the driving forces of American life, our contempt for thirst seems to hint at a thirst for change.'"}, "time": 1742628512.0212395}
