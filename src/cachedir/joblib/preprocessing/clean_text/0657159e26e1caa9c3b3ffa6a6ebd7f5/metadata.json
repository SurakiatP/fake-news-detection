Following is a transcript of that event, as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live analysis. TRUMP: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He\u2019s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed did very, very well. And so Alex, I\u2019ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he\u2019s going to be  \u2014   I think he\u2019ll be a tremendous secretary of labor. And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the   or as they say, \u201cnever Trump. \u201d And Paul just left and he\u2019s given us his total support. And it\u2019s all about unification. We\u2019re unifying the party and hopefully we\u2019re going to be able to unify the country. It\u2019s very important to me. I\u2019ve been talking about that for a long time. It\u2019s very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he\u2019s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that. I think I\u2019ll say a few words, and then we\u2019ll take some questions. And I had this time. We\u2019ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we\u2019ve done some really good work. We\u2019re very proud of that. And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we\u2019ll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That\u2019s always a possibility. I\u2019m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we\u2019ve done. A new Rasmussen poll, in fact  \u2014   because the people get it  \u2014   much of the media doesn\u2019t get it. They actually get it, but they don\u2019t write it. Let\u2019s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is  \u2014   to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, \u201cOh, that\u2019s good. \u201d Now it means, \u201cThat\u2019s good for jobs. \u201d Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league  \u2014   Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I\u2019m making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation\u2019s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit  \u2014   a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that\u2019s possible. Maybe it\u2019s not, and that\u2019s OK, too. TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D. C. along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don\u2019t talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what\u2019s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking  \u2014   and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re talking about the power structure we\u2019re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort  \u2014   not all the time  \u2014   and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say  \u2014   they\u2019re honest and fantastic. But much of it is not a  \u2014   the distortion  \u2014   and we\u2019ll talk about it, you\u2019ll be able to ask me questions about it. But we\u2019re not going to let it happen, because I\u2019m here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It\u2019s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country you see what\u2019s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea  \u2014   we\u2019ll take care of it folks we\u2019re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess. Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we\u2019ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you\u2019ve covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We\u2019ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women\u2019s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It\u2019s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He\u2019s over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it\u2019s in large sections of the world. They\u2019ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer  \u2014   another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they\u2019re the world\u2019s top sponsor of terrorism, and we\u2019re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it\u2019s not properly solved now, it\u2019s one of the worst agreements I\u2019ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I\u2019ve ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I\u2019ve had great from Congress, generally. We\u2019ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my  \u2014   I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we\u2019re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don\u2019t have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it\u2019s depleted  \u2014   it won\u2019t be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I\u2019m standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I\u2019m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we\u2019re having strong borders. Well, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They\u2019re so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I\u2019m doing probably aren\u2019t popular but they\u2019re necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I\u2019m here following through on what I pledged to do. That\u2019s all I\u2019m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn\u2019t supposed to get 222. They said there\u2019s no way to get 222, 230\u2019s impossible. 270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they\u2019ve never seen before so that\u2019s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media\u2019s trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they\u2019re not happy about it for whatever reason. And  \u2014   but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I\u2019ll be in Melbourne, Florida five o\u2019clock on Saturday and I heard  \u2014   just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T. V. open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   machine, despite the fact that I can\u2019t get my cabinet approved. And they\u2019re outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who\u2019s there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can\u2019t get approved. How do you not approve him? He\u2019s been a colleague  \u2014   highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We\u2019re waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that\u2019s working very hard, that\u2019s being very much misrepresented about and we can\u2019t let that happen. So, if the Democrats who have  \u2014   all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we\u2019ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. I\u2019ll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks  \u2014   in the weeks coming. We\u2019ve withdrawn from the   disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We\u2019re going to make trade deals but we\u2019re going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We\u2019re going to have one on one deals. We\u2019ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it\u2019s many, many years. And then at the end of the process  \u2014   they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me but it\u2019s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it\u2019s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don\u2019t want the jobs going to other countries. We\u2019ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We\u2019ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. We\u2019ve issued a   new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody\u2019s ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say \u201clet me see your regulations\u201d and they\u2019re fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental  \u2014   all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It\u2019s very important to me. But you don\u2019t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing. We\u2019ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We\u2019ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation  \u2014   take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We\u2019ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We\u2019re becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer. We\u2019ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general  \u2014   now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we\u2019re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it\u2019s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I\u2019ve negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke. We\u2019ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is  \u2014   that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further. We\u2019re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we\u2019ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn\u2019t say that. TRUMP: And I\u2019m reading the order, I\u2019m saying, why aren\u2019t we using American steel? And they said, that\u2019s a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D. C. I\u2019ve started by imposing a   lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We\u2019ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is\u2019s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing. So we\u2019ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It\u2019s already happening. But big league. I\u2019ve also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You\u2019ve seen what they\u2019ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson. He\u2019s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don\u2019t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do. Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2, 000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here. General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn\u2019t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I\u2019m announcing would never have come here. Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10, 000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10, 000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we\u2019re naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades  \u2014   decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we\u2019re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen. And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he\u2019ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the   way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that\u2019s done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p. m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let\u2019s take some questions. Mara (ph) Mara (ph) go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn\u2019t have to do that, because what he did wasn\u2019t wrong  \u2014   what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That\u2019s the real problem. And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this  \u2014   that they know nothing about it they weren\u2019t in Russia they never made a phone call to Russia they never received a phone call. It\u2019s all fake news. It\u2019s all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal  \u2014   I think it\u2019s very important  \u2014   the illegal, giving out classified information. It was  \u2014   and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much. I\u2019ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that\u2019s  \u2014   I spoke to the president of Mexico I had a good call. All of a sudden, it\u2019s out there for the world to see. It\u2019s supposed to be secret. It\u2019s supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I\u2019m saying  \u2014   the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that\u2019s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it\u2019s an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed. Yes, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he did anything wrong if anything, he did something right. \u201d He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, \u201cHuh, that\u2019s fine. \u201d That\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do. They\u2019re supposed to  \u2014   he didn\u2019t just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were    countries. He\u2019s doing the job. You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn\u2019t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn\u2019t remember. So either way, it wasn\u2019t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision. But he didn\u2019t tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn\u2019t remember. And that just wasn\u2019t acceptable to me. Yes? QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long   story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was  \u2014   it\u2019s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren\u2019t even a part, really  \u2014   I mean, they were such a minor part. They  \u2014   I hadn\u2019t spoken to them. I think the one person  \u2014   I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever spoken to him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very   member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don\u2019t think I ever met him. Now, it\u2019s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don\u2019t think I ever met him. I didn\u2019t talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don\u2019t think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That\u2019s what he does. I mean, people know that. That\u2019s Mr. Manafort, who\u2019s  \u2014   by the way, who\u2019s by the way a respected man. He\u2019s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody  \u2014   people knew that. Everybody knew that. So, these people  \u2014   and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don\u2019t print it because that\u2019s not good for their stories. TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don\u2019t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that\u2019s the extent. Russia is fake news. Russia  \u2014   this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they\u2019re there, because we have our new people going in place, right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo has  \u2014   has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he\u2019s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in. And just while you\u2019re at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time\u2019s story, yesterday. And it talked about  \u2014   these are (ph) front page. So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true. So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I\u2019ll tell you something, I\u2019ll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I\u2019ve never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page? That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that. And it was totally  \u2014   they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things. OK, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph) or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 ( ). (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Obama ( ) 426 on ( ). So why should Americans. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: . ..I\u2019m skipping that information, I don\u2019t know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin. QUESTION: ( ) why should Americans trust you ( ) the information ( )? TRUMP: Well, I don\u2019t know, I was given that information. I was given  \u2014   I actually, I\u2019ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that\u2019s. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes? QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did  \u2014   whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What \u2014   what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks. TRUMP: We are. QUESTION: Can we ask what you\u2019re going to do and also, we\u2019ve heard about a  \u2014   a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that? TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they\u2019re in position so I hope that we\u2019ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he\u2019s offered his services and you know, it\u2019s something we may take advantage of. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own. As far as the general\u2019s concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn\u2019t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn\u2019t think anything is wrong, you know, really didn\u2019t think. It was really, what happened after that but he didn\u2019t think anything was done wrong. I didn\u2019t either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said \u201cwell I don\u2019t see\u201d  \u2014   to me, he was doing the job. The information was provided by  \u2014   who I don\u2019t know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound like he did anything wrong there. \u201d But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as  \u2014   as far as the actual making the call, fact I\u2019ve watched various programs and I\u2019ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So  \u2014   and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he\u2019s a fine man. QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks  \u2014   on the leaks, sir. .. TRUMP: . ..Go ahead. Finish off then I\u2019ll get you. QUESTION: I\u2019m sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You\u2019ve said twice today. .. TRUMP: . ..Yes, we\u2019re looking at them very  \u2014   very, very serious. I\u2019ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we\u2019re  \u2014   I\u2019ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They\u2019re put out by people either in agencies  \u2014   I think you\u2019ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don\u2019t have our people in because we can\u2019t get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It\u2019s a criminal act. You know what I say, when I  \u2014   when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment  \u2014   when I was called out on Mexico, I was  \u2014   honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said \u201cyou know, it doesn\u2019t make sense. That won\u2019t happen\u201d but that wasn\u2019t that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who\u2019s a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said \u201cthat\u2019s terrible that it was leaked\u201d but it wasn\u2019t that important. But then I said to myself \u201cwhat happens when I\u2019m dealing with the problem of North Korea?\u201d What happens when I\u2019m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very  \u2014   you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don\u2019t want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test. So I\u2019m dealing with Mexico, I\u2019m dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the \u201cWashington Post\u201d and gets put into the \u201cNew York Times\u201d and I\u2019m saying \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen when I\u2019m dealing on the Middle East? What\u2019s going to happen when I\u2019m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We got to stop it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a criminal penalty. QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks? TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You\u2019re the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do  \u2014   and I hope we can correct it. Because there\u2019s nobody I have more respect for  \u2014   well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters. It\u2019s very important to me and especially in this position. It\u2019s very important. I don\u2019t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it\u2019s true and, you know, over a course of time, I\u2019ll make mistakes and you\u2019ll write badly and I\u2019m OK with that. But I\u2019m not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it\u2019s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don\u2019t watch it any more because it\u2019s very good  \u2014   he\u2019s saying no. It\u2019s OK, Jim (ph). It\u2019s OK, Jim (ph) you\u2019ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You\u2019re not the only one so don\u2019t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be  \u2014   I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody\u2019s ratings are right now but I think that actually  \u2014   I think that\u2019d actually be better. People  \u2014   I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know, Peter (ph) is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower  \u2014   I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I\u2019d appreciate it  \u2014   again, I don\u2019t mind bad stories when it\u2019s true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. TRUMP: I think we\u2019re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I\u2019m looking, some of them had them approved immediately. I\u2019m going forever and I still have a lot of people that we\u2019re waiting for. And that\u2019s all they\u2019re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he\u2019s got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they\u2019d be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they\u2019re happy and everybody\u2019s good. And sometimes  \u2014   I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s fine. But I think it would  \u2014   I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they\u2019re not giving classified information. They\u2019re giving stuff  \u2014   what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates. Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine  \u2014   seriously  \u2014   can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric  \u2014   you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We\u2019ll do you next Jim, I do you next( ph). QUESTION: ( ) clarify  \u2014   TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador  \u2014   TRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t. QUESTION:  \u2014   prior to your  \u2014   TRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t. QUESTION:  \u2014   inauguration. TRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t. QUESTION: And then fired him  \u2014   TRUMP: Excuse me. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn\u2019t doing it. I didn\u2019t direct him, but I would have directed him because that\u2019s his job. And it came out that way  \u2014   and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I\u2019ve watched many other people say that. No, I didn\u2019t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn\u2019t do it. OK? Jim? QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don\u2019t hate you. I don\u2019t hate you. TRUMP: OK. QUESTION: So, pass that along  \u2014   TRUMP: Ask  \u2014   ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. OK? QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir  \u2014   TRUMP: Well, that\u2019s  \u2014   well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren\u2019t as good as some of the other people that are waiting. QUESTION: It\u2019s pretty good right now, actually. TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John. QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time  \u2014   TRUMP: I was OK with it. QUESTION:  \u2014   you said  \u2014   you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30, 000  . I\u2019m wondering, sir, if you  \u2014   TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that. QUESTION: Then( ph) your( ph) numbers( ph) were off too. TRUMP: No  \u2014   no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that. QUESTION: If  \u2014   if I may ask you, sir, it  \u2014   it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during( ph) the campaign  \u2014   TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready? QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that  \u2014   TRUMP: No  \u2014   no, but let me do one at a time. QUESTION: If I may as a follow up? TRUMP: Do you mind? QUESTION: Yes, sir. TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you\u2019re talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you\u2019re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn\u2019t classified information. But in one case, you\u2019re talking about classified  \u2014   regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong  \u2014   at my suggestion  \u2014   and I give Reince great credit for this  \u2014   at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I don\u2019t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so  \u2014   they were  \u2014   when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn\u2019t even in the papers. Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she  \u2014   and she should have reported herself. Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it\u2019s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job. \u201d QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don\u2019t understand. It seems that there\u2019s a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake? TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: You know what it is? Here\u2019s the thing. The public isn\u2019t  \u2014   you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or false because they\u2019re not involved. I\u2019m involved. I\u2019ve been involved with this stuff all my life. But I\u2019m involved. So I know when you\u2019re telling the truth or when you\u2019re not. I just see many, many untruthful things. And I\u2019ll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word \u201ctone. \u201d The tone is such hatred. I\u2019m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such  \u2014   I do get good ratings, you have to admit that  \u2014   the tone is such hatred. I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox  Friends in the morning, they\u2019re very honorable people. They\u2019re very  \u2014   not because they\u2019re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That\u2019s all I can say. It\u2019s the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look  \u2014   the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes  \u2014   sometimes somebody gets. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o\u2019clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive  . The good news is he doesn\u2019t have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive  . And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth the hatred coming from other people on your network. Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I\u2019m amazed by it. And I just think you\u2019d be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know. I  \u2014   I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it\u2019s  \u2014   it\u2019s brutal. Now, they\u2019ll take this news conference  \u2014   I\u2019m actually having a very good time, OK? But they\u2019ll take this news conference  \u2014   don\u2019t forget, that\u2019s the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, that\u2019s how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn\u2019t win by people listening to you people. That\u2019s for sure. But I\u2019m having a good time. Tomorrow, they will say, \u201cDonald Trump rants and raves at the press. \u201d I\u2019m not ranting and raving. I\u2019m just telling you. You know, you\u2019re dishonest people. But  \u2014   but I\u2019m not ranting and raving. I love this. I\u2019m having a good time doing it. But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, \u201cDonald Trump rants and raves. \u201d I\u2019m not ranting and raving. Go ahead. QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup. .. TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have  \u2014   let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down. We\u2019ll. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir. .. TRUMP: I\u2019m changing it from fake news, though. QUESTION: Doesn\u2019t that under. .. TRUMP: Very fake news. QUESTION: . .. I know, but aren\u2019t you. .. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news. TRUMP: And you\u2019re not related to our new. .. QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say. TRUMP: I looked  \u2014   you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta. QUESTION: I\u2019m sure you checked that out, sir. TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it  \u2014   I said  \u2014   they said, \u201cNo, sir. \u201d I said, \u201cDo me a favor, go back and check the family tree. \u201d QUESTION: But aren\u2019t you  \u2014   aren\u2019t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people\u2019s faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don\u2019t like \u201cfake news\u201d? Why not just say it\u2019s a story I don\u2019t like. TRUMP: I do that. QUESTION: When you call it \u201cfake news,\u201d you\u2019re undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important. TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here\u2019s the thing. OK. I understand what you\u2019re  \u2014   and you\u2019re right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I\u2019ll say, \u201cWow, that\u2019s going to be a great story. \u201d And I\u2019ll get killed. I know what\u2019s good and bad. I\u2019d be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what\u2019s good. I know what\u2019s bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive  \u2014   sometimes something that should be very positive, they\u2019ll make OK. They\u2019ll even make it negative. So I understand it. So, because I\u2019m there. I know what was said. I know who\u2019s saying it. I\u2019m there. So it\u2019s very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it\u2019s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press  \u2014   the public doesn\u2019t believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don\u2019t know. But they don\u2019t believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go  \u2014   as an example, you\u2019re CNN, I mean it\u2019s story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running  \u2014   this is a   machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph). You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don\u2019t talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I\u2019m saying \u201chere\u2019s my chief of staff,\u201d a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right? We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some  \u2014   all over the country, you take a look, he\u2019s done a great job. And I said to myself, you know  \u2014   and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said \u201cyou take a look at Reince, he\u2019s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. \u201d I mean, they\u2019re fake. They\u2019re not true. And isn\u2019t that a shame because he\u2019d rather be working on healthcare, he\u2019d rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph). I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there\u2019s a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know  \u2014   you know, whatever reason. But  \u2014   and I understand that. But you\u2019ve got to be at least a little bit fair and that\u2019s why the public sees it. They see it. They see it\u2019s not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn\u2019t fake news? And second. .. TRUMP: . ..I think they don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t think the public  \u2014   that\u2019s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don\u2019t think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I\u2019m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that\u2019s a ruse. That\u2019s a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now tomorrow, you\u2019ll say \u201cDonald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible. \u201d It\u2019s not terrible. It\u2019s good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn\u2019t do anything for Russia. I\u2019ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton  \u2014   that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I\u2019m a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that\u2019s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who\u2019s going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said \u201cI know politically it\u2019s probably not good for me. \u201d The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that\u2019s 30 miles off shore right out of the water. Everyone in this country\u2019s going to say \u201coh, it\u2019s so great. \u201d That\u2019s not great. That\u2019s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you\u2019ve had a lot of presidents that haven\u2019t taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can  \u2014   now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But  \u2014   but it\u2019s possible I won\u2019t be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said \u201cyou know. \u201d He\u2019s sitting behind his desk and he\u2019s saying \u201cyou know, I see what\u2019s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It\u2019s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he\u2019s got with this fake story. \u201d OK? And that\u2019s a shame because if we could get along with Russia  \u2014   and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing. QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)? QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you. .. TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We\u2019re doing Obamacare. We\u2019re in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It\u2019s not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner. So we\u2019ll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March,   March. And after that, we\u2019re going to come up, and we\u2019re doing very well on tax reform. Yes? QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let\u2019s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States. TRUMP: OK. QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel  \u2014   the spy vessel off the coast of the United States. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries and a Russian plane buzzed a U. S. destroyer. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign . .. TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re back to the old games with the United States there\u2019s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us. \u201d Because the  \u2014   you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, \u201cOh, isn\u2019t that wonderful. \u201d But I know you well enough. Then you would say, \u201cOh, he was too tough he shouldn\u2019t have done that. \u201d Look, all of the. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I\u2019m just trying to find out your orientation to those. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he\u2019s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it\u2019s politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a reset. It failed. They all tried. But I\u2019m different than those people. Go ahead. QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal? TRUMP: I have. I have. And I\u2019m so beautifully represented. I\u2019m so honored that the Senate approved him. He\u2019s going to be fantastic. Yes, I think that I\u2019ve already. .. QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir? TRUMP: No, I don\u2019t think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can\u2019t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying I\u2019m a politician, but I guess that\u2019s what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we\u2019re not going to make a deal. Now, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to make a deal. I don\u2019t know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough  \u2014   the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world. If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along  \u2014   and don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There\u2019s no upside. We\u2019re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we\u2019re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They\u2019re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing. QUESTION: So when you say they\u2019re not good, do you mean that they are. .. TRUMP: Who did I say is not good? QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they\u2019re not good. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, it\u2019s not good, but they happened. QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine. .. TRUMP: They all happened recently. No. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. this country\u2019s ability to work with Russia? TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they\u2019re doing because they\u2019re doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I\u2019m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don\u2019t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK? But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I\u2019m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She\u2019s close to Russia. QUESTION: Can we. .. TRUMP: I gave  \u2014   you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing. QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations? TRUMP: I\u2019m not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don\u2019t talk about military response. I don\u2019t say I\u2019m going into Mosul in four months. \u201cWe are going to attack Mosul in four months. \u201d Then three months later, \u201cWe are going to attack Mosul in one month. \u201d \u201cNext week, we are going to attack Mosul. \u201d In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don\u2019t talk about military, and I don\u2019t talk about certain other things, you\u2019re going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I\u2019d say that. So I don\u2019t have to tell you. I don\u2019t want to be one of these guys that say, \u201cYes, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. \u201d I don\u2019t have to do that. I don\u2019t have to tell you what I\u2019m going to do in North Korea. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don\u2019t have to tell you what I\u2019m going to do in North Korea. And I don\u2019t have to tell you what I\u2019m going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn\u2019t know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I\u2019m not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won\u2019t have to do anything, but I\u2019m not going to tell you. OK. QUESTION: Could I just ask you  \u2014   thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble. .. TRUMP: Where are you from? QUESTION: BBC. TRUMP: Here\u2019s another beauty. QUESTION: That\u2019s a good line. Impartial, free and fair. TRUMP: Yeah. Sure. QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: Just like CNN right? QUESTION: On the travel ban  \u2014   we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government. .. TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government. .. QUESTION: Were there any mistakes. .. TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that\u2019s been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it\u2019s 80 percent of the time, a lot. We had a bad decision. We\u2019re going to keep going with that decision. We\u2019re going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision. That\u2019s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect. Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a   period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones. You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that\u2019s like you. You have some bad people out there. Kelly said you can\u2019t do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don\u2019t have time to come in. Now nobody ever reports that. But that\u2019s why we did it quickly. Now, if I would\u2019ve done it a month, everything would\u2019ve been perfect. The problem is we would\u2019ve wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would\u2019ve come into our country. Now in the meantime, we\u2019re vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed. QUESTION: Just a brief  . But if it\u2019s so urgent, why not introduce. .. TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election? TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that\u2019s one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been. QUESTION: During the election? TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody. .. QUESTION: So you\u2019re not aware of any contact during the course.. TRUMP: Look, look, look. .. QUESTION: . .. of the election? TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question? QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse. I know you have to get up and ask a question. It\u2019s so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven\u2019t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don\u2019t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn\u2019t. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I\u2019m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I\u2019m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does. Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that  \u2014   whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that. QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election? TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he  \u2014   now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who\u2019s a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time. QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks? QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five? QUESTION: Mr. President, on national. .. TRUMP: Wait. Let\u2019s see. Who\u2019s  \u2014   I want to find a friendly reporter. QUESTION: Mr. ... TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. QUESTION: ( ). .. TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven\u2019t seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the  \u2014   anyone on your staff of being ( ). Because ( ). However, what we\u2019ve already heard about and what we ( ) is ( ) so you\u2019re general forecast (ph) like 48 ( ). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the ( ). .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:. ..he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it\u2019s not, its not, not  \u2014   not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question. So here\u2019s the story, folks. Number one, I am the least   Semitic person that you\u2019ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican  \u2014   quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about  \u2014   he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I\u2019ve known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it. So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you, I\u2019m Lisa (ph) from the. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that\u2019s the way the press is. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines? TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific. .. TRUMP: It\u2019s a very fair question. QUESTION: . ..countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration. TRUMP: Right. QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it? TRUMP: We\u2019re gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it\u2019s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids. In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they\u2019re gang members and they\u2019re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way  \u2014   it\u2019s a very  \u2014   it\u2019s a very, very tough subject. We\u2019re gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don\u2019t forget and I have to convince them that what I\u2019m saying is  \u2014   is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that. But the DACA situation is a very, very  \u2014   it\u2019s a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough. I\u2019m not talking about new laws, I\u2019m talking the existing law, is very rough, it\u2019s very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision. But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we\u2019re tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK? QUESTION: Mr. President. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..reopening of the White House Visitors Office? TRUMP: Yes. QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean. .. TRUMP: Now, that\u2019s what I call a nice question. That is very  \u2014   who are you with? QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Good, I\u2019m gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania\u2019s terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania\u2019s gonna be outstanding, that\u2019s right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House. She, like others that she\u2019s working with, feel very, very strongly about women\u2019s issue, women\u2019s difficulties. Very, very strongly, she\u2019s a very, very strong advocate. I think she\u2019s a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens, because she gets  \u2014   she gets so unfairly  \u2014   Melania, the things they say. I\u2019ve known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn\u2019t even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you\u2019ll ever find. And the things they say  \u2014   I\u2019ve known her for a long time  \u2014   the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she\u2019s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies. I\u2019ll just tell you this. I think she\u2019s going to be a fantastic first lady. She\u2019s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they\u2019re not doing this for money. They\u2019re not doing this for pay, they\u2019re doing this because they feel it both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school  \u2014   because it\u2019s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left  \u2014   she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that\u2019s a very nice question. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that\u2019s OK. QUESTION: It doesn\u2019t( ph) have( ph) to be a bad question. TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead. QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you\u2019re  \u2014   TRUMP: Fix the inner cities. QUESTION:  \u2014   president. Fixing the inner cities. TRUMP: Yep. QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that\u2019s coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn\u2019t bad, was it? TRUMP: That was very professional and very good. QUESTION: I\u2019m very professional. TRUMP: We\u2019ll be announcing the order in a little while and I\u2019d rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we\u2019ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it\u2019s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And by the way, if I might add, including the women\u2019s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We\u2019re going to try and fix as quickly as possible  \u2014   you know, it takes a long time. It\u2019s taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we\u2019re going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we\u2019re going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places and it\u2019s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people  \u2014   and I\u2019ve seen this, and I\u2019ve sort of witnessed it  \u2014   in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They\u2019re living in hell. We can\u2019t let that happen. So, we\u2019re going to be very, very strong. That\u2019s a great question and  \u2014   and it\u2019s a  \u2014   it\u2019s a very difficult situation because it\u2019s been many, many years. It\u2019s been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There\u2019s one Chicago that\u2019s incredible, luxurious and all  \u2014   and safe. There\u2019s another Chicago that\u2019s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we\u2019re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK? QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going  \u2014   are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your  \u2014   your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as  \u2014   TRUMP: Am I going to include who? QUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional  \u2014   TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION:  \u2014   Hispanic Caucus  \u2014   TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION: No  \u2014   no  \u2014   no. I\u2019m not  \u2014   TRUMP: Are they friends of yours? QUESTION: I\u2019m just a reporter. TRUMP: Well, then( ph) set up the meeting. QUESTION: I know some of them, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re watching right now. TRUMP: Let\u2019s go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it\u2019s great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it\u2019s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can\u2019t move, it might be bad for me politically. I can\u2019t have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy. QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well. TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can\u2019t make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told  \u2014   he was probably told \u201cdon\u2019t meet with Trump. It\u2019s bad politics. \u201d And that\u2019s part of the problem in this country. OK, one more. QUESTION: (inaudible) TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can\u2019t handle. This room can\u2019t handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two. QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible) some of it by supporters in your name. What do you. .. TRUMP: . ..And some of it  \u2014   can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don\u2019t think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you\u2019ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they\u2019re put up by the other side and you think it\u2019s like playing it straight? No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They\u2019ll do signs and they\u2019ll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won\u2019t be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead. QUESTION: You\u2019re the president now. What are you going to do about it? TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that? QUESTION: What are you going to do about  \u2014   what are you going to do about (inaudible). TRUMP: Oh, I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m working on it very  \u2014   no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided  \u2014   I didn\u2019t come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here. We\u2019re going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that\u2019s part of it. But we\u2019re going to work on education, we\u2019re going to work on  \u2014   you know, we\u2019re going to stop  \u2014   we\u2019re going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we\u2019re going to try and stop crime. We\u2019re not going to try and stop, we\u2019re going to stop crime. But it\u2019s very important to me  \u2014   but this isn\u2019t Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try  \u2014   I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much. It\u2019s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks. END'"}, "time": 1742562929.1429157}
