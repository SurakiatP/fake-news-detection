Maxine Waters ( ) said she will not be attending President Donald Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress because she explained, \u201cI don\u2019t choose to honor him. \u201d  Waters said, \u201cThis is ceremonial. And in this ceremony people lie. They smile. They shake hands. They hug each other. They honor the president. I\u2019m not about any of that.

I\u2019ve said that. And I won\u2019t be a part of the ceremony. And that\u2019s that. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564061.4348867}
