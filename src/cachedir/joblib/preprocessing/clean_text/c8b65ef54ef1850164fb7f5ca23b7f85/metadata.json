But Scarborough seems unable to shake thoughts  \u2014   or are they fantasies?  \u2014   about White House senior adviser Steve Bannon. [On Friday morning, Scarborough fumed at President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords by blaming Bannon:  He has gone in. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know anything about policy. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know anything about politics. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know anything about anything. He can get up and give a good speech. You listen to him talk about any topic and he wanders from sentence to sentence to sentence. So Steve Bannon is now the President of the United States. And that was more clear yesterday than ever before. Scarborough kept returning to the \u201cPresident Bannon\u201d theme. Mediate\u2019s Jon Levine kept count: Scarborough said the words \u201cPresident Bannon\u201d seven times in one minute: President Bannon is on the wrong side of the majority. President Bannon may be right when President Bannon is looking at President Bannon\u2019s primary base, but when President Bannon is looking at the overall scope of American voters   \u2026     President Bannon\u2019s not even reading the polls right for today.   \u2026     Again, a small subset of the population that President Bannon\u2019s obsessed with. The \u201cPresident Bannon\u201d meme is one that gained traction on the left, several weeks ago, in what seemed to be a deliberate effort to tweak President Trump, and provoke him to sideline Bannon. The media congratulated themselves when they thought they had achieved just that, and looked forward to Bannon\u2019s supposedly imminent departure from the administration. Along the way, some of them began to believe their own malicious propaganda. Now that they have failed, and that Bannon continues to play a critical role, Scarborough is returning to the same theme, apparently hoping that repeating the phrase \u201cPresident Bannon!\u201d like a kind of magic incanation will cause him to disappear. Alternatively, Scarborough\u2019s behavior is involuntary, the sign of far deeper emotional attachment. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
