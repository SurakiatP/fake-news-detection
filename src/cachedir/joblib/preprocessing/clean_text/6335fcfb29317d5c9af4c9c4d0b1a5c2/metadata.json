While he may smile from time to time, it always seems forced, as if he\u2019s afraid his face will crack if he smiles too broadly. And now he\u2019s whining yet again about Alec Baldwin\u2019s brilliant portrayal of him on Saturday Night Live. \\nAs part of an interview with AJ Calloway of Extra , Trump had this to say about the way Baldwin plays him: \u201cWell, I think I\u2019m a much nicer guy than he\u2019s portraying. He\u2019s portraying someone who\u2019s very mean and nasty, and I\u2019m not mean and nasty. I think I\u2019m a much nicer person than he\u2019s portraying, so I think it\u2019s an inaccurate portrayal of me.\u201d \\nClearly, in addition to Trump not having a sense of humor, he also is deficient in the self-awareness department. \\nWould the Donald ever do SNL again? Not a chance, he declared: \u201cThey want me to go back. No, I\u2019m not interested in going back\u2026They\u2019re making me out to be a very mean, bad kind of a guy and that\u2019s not me.\u201d \\nTrump was also asked about the fact that NBC had fired Billy Bush due to the leaked videotape in which Trump said he likes to grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d and kiss them against their will. The GOP nominee cryptically responded that \u201cthey did it to him,\u201d but would not elaborate on who \u201cthey\u201d might be. He then added : \u201cI have always liked Billy, but I have not [spoken to him]\u2026but I always found Billy to be a good guy.\u201d \\nYeah, a good guy who laughed when you brazenly talked about how you get off on sexually assaulting women because you happen to be wealthy and famous. \\nFace it, Donald, you\u2019re a pig. And to make matters worse, you can\u2019t even laugh at yourself. \\nFeatured Image Via Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
