Host Bill Maher asked Lieu how Trump going against Russia to launch the strike on Syria \u201cfit into the Republican  \u2014   the liberal idea that he was installed by Putin as a stooge to do whatever Putin wanted? This is not what Putin wanted. \u201d Lieu responded, \u201cIf you\u2019re facing possible collusion with Putin, you might just want to distract people. \u201d He added, \u201cIt might be, we don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve learned to not predict Donald Trump. But, in this case, what he did was not only unconstitutional, there\u2019s no strategy. We don\u2019t know what were doing in Syria, how long we\u2019re going to be there. He\u2019s got US ground forces there now that are more at risk of being attacked because he just attacked Assad. He has to tell the American people what we\u2019re doing in Syria, he has not done that. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564089.0052521}
