Mr. Nunes, the California lawmaker, stood inside the Capitol\u2019s Statuary Hall on Thursday evening, assuming a familiar set of positions: in front of a camera, giving cover to President Trump and defending himself. The subject this time was his decision on Wednesday to brief Mr. Trump, whose campaign his committee is investigating, about possible \u201cincidental\u201d surveillance of the president or his associates. \u201cI still think it\u2019s the right call,\u201d Mr. Nunes said of his decision not to tell members of his committee about his trip to the White House. But as he spoke inside the Capitol, a committee colleague, Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, peered into a different camera, belonging to CNN, a few feet to the left. \u201cIt is almost inconceivable,\u201d Mr. Himes said of his chairman\u2019s behavior, more than loud enough to hear nearby. \u201cLo and behold, a couple of hours later, Donald Trump gets to put the barest of fig leaves on the outrageous tweet about Barack Obama wiretapping him. \u201d Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Nunes has proved an eager purveyor of executive fig leaves. As the leader of an investigation involving the campaign of a man he cheered vocally and served directly as a transition team official, the congressman has often appeared almost incurious about the chief subject of the inquiry. Of greater concern in the intelligence sphere is his recent burst of media exposure, with a public speaking style that can at times seem cavalier while discussing sensitive information. This has led to misgivings about sharing national security details with him, a senior American intelligence official said. Many lawmakers crave attention, racing to microphones and pounding lecterns in search of cable news glory. But Mr. Nunes, who can seem by turns earnest and reticent in person, is something different: After over a decade in the House, he has appeared to lurch haphazardly into the spotlight, like Kramer entering a room on \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d straining to keep his balance as a human shield in Washington\u2019s daily Trump wars. Mr. Nunes said on Fox News that he felt he \u201chad a duty and obligation\u201d to tell Mr. Trump about the possible surveillance. \u201cBecause as you know, he\u2019s taking a lot of heat in the news media. \u201d Now the president has company in that regard: Mr. Nunes, a former dairy farmer, elected to Congress in 2002 at age 29, from a   section of a   state. The Democratic National Committee has even adopted a new label for him: \u201cWhite House stooge. \u201d It was not always thus. Mr. Nunes was 23 when he was first elected to public office, as a board member of a local community college where he had started his higher education. Eyeing his first campaign, Mr. Nunes sought advice from Representative Jim Costa, a Democrat who is also from the Central Valley in California and was serving in the State Legislature at the time. Both belonged to the area\u2019s   Portuguese community. Mr. Costa said he recognized a familiar drive. \u201cWe all show that kind of interest when we\u2019re in our 20s and 30s, and we want to try to get an opportunity to see if we can make a difference,\u201d Mr. Costa said. Until recently, Mr. Nunes\u2019s most memorable flourish in the House was his blistering assessment in 2013 of Republicans who were willing to shut down the federal government over President Obama\u2019s health law: \u201clemmings with suicide vests. \u201d Now, he has largely retained the support of his colleagues, despite complaints from Republicans like Senator John McCain of Arizona over his committee stewardship, amplifying calls for an independent commission to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s connections to Russia. On Friday, Mr. Nunes summoned reporters once more to relay information that Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman with questionable ties to Russia, had volunteered to appear before the committee. Mr. Nunes also announced the cancellation of a public meeting with former intelligence and law enforcement leaders, citing a desire to bring in James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, and Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, for a closed session instead. Both testified before the committee this week. Representative Adam Schiff of California, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, suggested that once again the chairman had acted unilaterally, this time to scuttle the hearing. And in a sign of how far their relationship has fallen, Mr. Schiff  \u2014   who for weeks stood by Mr. Nunes\u2019s side before reporters and defended him  \u2014   accused him of taking that action because the White House had told him to. This was the capper to an eventful few days for Mr. Nunes. Presiding over a committee hearing on Monday  \u2014   when Mr. Comey took the extraordinary step of announcing the agency\u2019s investigation into whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election  \u2014   Mr. Nunes mustered deeper alarm over anonymous sources revealing an inquiry\u2019s details to journalists than over the contents of the investigation. On Wednesday, he told reporters he had received information that Mr. Trump or members of his team may have been \u201cincidentally\u201d swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. Pressed on whether the White House had provided him the information to produce a \u201cfeedback loop\u201d that might aid the president, Mr. Nunes has declined to reveal his sources, saying he does not want to discourage others from coming forward  \u2014   a rationale analogous to reporters\u2019 arguments for protecting anonymous sources. It has also not always been entirely clear what Mr. Nunes is talking about. \u201cWas the president also part of that incidental collection, his communications?\u201d one reporter asked on Wednesday. \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Nunes said, after glancing at the floor for a moment. Heads snapped up from their phones and notepads. \u201cExcuse me, let me just clarify,\u201d another reporter began. \u201cThe president of the United States\u2019 personal communications were intercepted as an incidental part of intelligence gathering  \u2014  \u201d Mr. Nunes appeared to reconsider. \u201cWhen we talk about intelligence products here, we\u2019ve got to be very careful,\u201d he said. By Thursday evening, he still did not seem certain about the contents of what he had divulged. He has said he could decipher the identities of Trump associates from reading reports about intercepted communications that were shared among Obama administration officials with top security clearances. But he has stressed that he did not have evidence to support Mr. Trump\u2019s claim of being personally wiretapped. Regardless, the president and some allies have seized on the comments as validation. \u201cI mean, look, my guess is there\u2019s probably a lot more than what I was able to see,\u201d Mr. Nunes said, when asked if Mr. Trump was indeed vindicated. \u201cAnd then he\u2019ll have to make up his own mind. \u201d Democrats have said that Mr. Nunes apologized for leaving them out of the loop. Mr. Nunes, who said he would not do anything differently if given the chance, said he understood why some were upset. But he chafed at discussions of his private conversations. \u201cThat stuff,\u201d he said, \u201cis not supposed to leak out. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562159.3294332}
