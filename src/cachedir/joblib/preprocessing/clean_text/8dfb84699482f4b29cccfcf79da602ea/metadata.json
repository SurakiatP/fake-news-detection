She does it. The guy down the block does it. Everyone engages in profiling \u2014 continually. \\nFor example, if you see a bunch of rough-hewn young men walking down the block and you move to the other side; if you patronize the deli with the clean-cut guy behind the counter and not the one with the tattooed, body-pierced, greasy-haired Greenwich Village retread; or prefer a 50-year-old school bus driver for your child to a 22-year-old one, you\u2019ve engaged in profiling. How about when a mother would choose a 17-year-old girl to babysit her child but definitely not a 17-year-old boy because most child molestation is committed by males? Is that fair? After all, just as most Muslims don\u2019t engage in terrorism, most young men don\u2019t molest children. But life\u2019s not fair. And anyone who thinks a profile is invalidated simply because most members of the group in question don\u2019t conform to it, doesn\u2019t understand profiling. \\nAs Dr. Walter Williams has put it, profiling is a method by which we can make decisions based on scant information when the cost of obtaining more information would be too high. For example, since you can\u2019t spend a month living with a prospective babysitter, getting to know him personally, we have to use \u201can observable or known physical attribute as a proxy or estimator of some other unobservable or unknown attribute,\u201d as Williams has put it . It\u2019s the same with airport security, where thousands of people must be screened within a short time. And doctors profile, too; to use some examples Williams has cited, black men have a prostate cancer rate twice that of white men, physicians check women and not men for breast cancer even though men occasionally develop it, and recommend prostate exams for men over 40 but not for 25-year-olds. When a doctor does this, is he guilty of \u201cracism,\u201d \u201csexism\u201d and \u201cageism\u201d? \\nWhat all this reflects is simply the reality of \u201cdiversity.\u201d And given that criminality isn\u2019t the one area of life where differences among groups suddenly cease to exist, it\u2019s not surprising that authorities, instead of checking their brain at the door, also use profiling. In their realm, the practice is used to determine the probability that a given individual has committed a crime or has criminal intent. And a profile can include many factors. For example, I\u2019m a member of perhaps the most profiled group in the nation \u2014 men \u2014 who police view more suspiciously than women because men commit an inordinate portion of the crime. Young people are also viewed more suspiciously for the same reason. \\nAside from sex and age, other factors in a criminal profile can pertain to dress, behavior, the car being driven, whether a person is out of place in a given neighborhood and many other things \u2014 including race, ethnicity and religion. And this is where we have to be careful not to descend into prejudice and unjust discrimination. \\nOf course, we have to know what that would be. Here\u2019s a good example: if you bat not an eye at profiling men or young people but then complain about profiling Muslims or blacks, you\u2019re prejudiced. If you insist that considering racial factors is \u201cracism\u201d but don\u2019t call the profiling of men and the young \u201csexism\u201d and \u201cageism,\u201d you\u2019re prejudiced. And if after having been made aware of this double standard, you persist in it, you are, practically speaking, a bad person. \\nThis point cannot be made often enough. There are only two kinds of profiling: Good profiling and bad profiling. Good profiling considers all relevant factors, in accordance with legitimate criminological science; bad profiling does not. Yet propagandists, and the genuinely misguided, have convinced people that the truth is precisely the opposite of what it is: that not cherry-picking \u2014 refusing to exclude certain relevant racial factors from a profile \u2014 is so-called \u201cracial profiling\u201d and is wrong. (They descend into further inanity in claiming that profiling Muslims is \u201cracial profiling\u201d even though \u201cIslam\u201d is not a race.) \\nI wrote \u201ccertain relevant racial factors\u201d because the anti-profiling crew has no problem profiling whites. For example, we often hear that mass shooters are inordinately white; the kicker here is that this is untrue . As I demonstrated in 2014 by analyzing data provided by left-wing site Mother Jones , whites commit mass shootings in accordance with their overall percentage of the population (interestingly, the only group overrepresented in this category was Americans of Asian descent). This brings us to another point: leftists engage in profiling no less than anyone else. \\nThey just do it all wrong. \\nConsider: immediately following the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, MSNBC suggested it might have been perpetrated by pro-lifers (profile: \u201cwhite Christians\u201d). CNN opined that it could have been the handiwork of militia types (profile: \u201cwhite Christians\u201d). Of course, probability dictated the culprits were precisely who they turned out to be: Muslims. This brings us to the last point: the Left engages in projection when it complains that comprehensive profiling reflects prejudice and unjust discrimination. \\nIn reality, the Left\u2019s profiling is all about prejudice and unjust discrimination. \\nAs Dictionary.com informs , a prejudice is \u201can unfavorable opinion or feeling formed beforehand or without knowledge, thought, or reason.\u201d The assumption that the San Bernardino terrorists were Muslim wasn\u2019t a prejudice, but simply a reflection of criminological knowledge. Likewise, that 87 percent of those targeted by the NYC police\u2019s stop-and-frisk program were black or Hispanic didn\u2019t reflect prejudice, but the reality that 96 percent of all crimes in NYC are committed by blacks and Hispanics. \\nIn contrast, the Left\u2019s profiling is not about scientific correctness but political correctness, not about what a group does but what it is . Can a group be profiled? Christians, yes; Muslims, no. Whites, yes; blacks, no. Men, yes; women, no. Heterosexuals, yes; homosexuals, no. It is all prejudice, all of the time. \\nUnfortunately, none of the arguments above, no matter how well or how often stated, will do anything to purge this leftist prejudice. To paraphrase satirist Jonathan Swift, \u201cYou cannot reason a man out of a position he has not reasoned himself into.\u201d Leftists are divorced from Truth and operate based on feelings, and a misbegotten emotional attachment cannot be remedied with an intellectual approach. Instead, political correctness must die. Until exhibiting such means what speaking the Truth does now \u2014 scorn, ostracism and career destruction \u2014 until it is rooted out from the culture-shaping media, academia and entertainment, we\u2019ll be left with the Left\u2019s profiling and not the right profiling. \\nHow could this be accomplished? By counteracting the social code of political correctness and its attendant social pressure with social pressure designed to deny posturing leftists their illusory high ground; turn a source of moral preening into a source of shame. To oppose proper profiling is to harm our society. To support unjust double standards in profiling is to be prejudiced. And doing this even after hearing the truth, is to be a bad person. \\n\\n, follow him on Twitter or log on to SelwynDuke.com Please review our Comment Policy before posting a comment \\nThank you for joining the discussion at The New American.
