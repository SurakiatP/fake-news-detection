In letters to the judge, Mr. Caspersen\u2019s mother, friends and former colleagues on Wall Street paint a picture of a modest man who had a \u201cfirm grasp of the \u2018right\u2019 thing to do. \u201d Even his wedding photographer and the doorman in the Upper East Side apartment building where Mr. Caspersen lives wrote in support. Their depictions are at odds with the government\u2019s, which has detailed how Mr. Caspersen ran a   scheme to steal nearly $40 million, only to lose it all in   bets on the stock market. He pleaded guilty to one charge of security fraud and one charge of wire fraud in July. The most important letter of all, however, may be one from Dr. Marc N. Potenza, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine, who called Mr. Caspersen\u2019s \u201csevere gambling\u201d a mental illness. The lawyer for Mr. Caspersen contends that it was an extreme compulsion to trade stock options that drove his client with an Ivy League pedigree to lie and steal from his friends, family and a hedge fund foundation. In an unusual departure from the typical   sentencing, Judge Jed S. Rakoff has agreed to hear testimony from Dr. Potenza on what constitutes a gambling addiction before imposing a sentence on the    Mr. Caspersen. Judge Rakoff is set to sentence Mr. Caspersen at the Federal District Court in Manhattan on Friday. It is not known whether federal prosecutors in Manhattan will call any witnesses of their own or simply look to   Dr. Potenza. The testimony could be critical to Mr. Caspersen\u2019s attempt to persuade Judge Rakoff to impose a more lenient sentence than the more than 15 years in prison that federal prosecutors have said is appropriate. Mr. Caspersen was arrested in March at La Guardia Airport in New York as he was returning from a family vacation to Florida. He pleaded guilty in July, telling Judge Rakoff he was \u201cashamed for my crimes\u201d and for causing harm to people close to him. Shortly before the arrest, Mr. Caspersen drafted a suicide note to his wife and a \u201cletter to his \u2018creditors,\u2019\u201d in which he said he was \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d and said he had \u201cengaged in an \u2018outright fraud,\u2019\u201d his lawyer said in a court filing. The suicide note was an eerie reminder of his father, Finn M. W. Caspersen, who killed himself in 2009 while battling cancer. The elder Mr. Caspersen made his fortune running what used to be known as Beneficial Finance and later gave a good deal of money to Harvard Law School. The elder Mr. Caspersen and all of his sons, including Andrew Caspersen, attended Harvard Law. Andrew Caspersen\u2019s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, has likened his client\u2019s urges to trade tens of millions of dollars worth of stock options as an addiction no less gripping than one to alcohol or drugs. Although such addictive behavior does not excuse Mr. Caspersen\u2019s conduct, he said, it is a mitigating circumstance that Judge Rakoff should take into consideration. \u201cHe never intended for them to lose, yet he could not stop,\u201d Mr. Shechtman said in a filing accompanying the letters from Dr. Potenza and other associates of Mr. Caspersen. Mr. Shechtman has said that his client has undergone treatment since his arrest. The lawyer\u2019s call for leniency has not moved prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan. They are asking Judge Rakoff to impose a stiff sentence that is within the range established by federal sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors, in their own court filing, are taking a tougher position than the probation department for the federal courts, which has recommended a sentence of seven years. Some federal judges have expressed frustration with the guidelines because they potentially hamstring jurists and do not take into account mitigating circumstances. One such critic has been Judge Rakoff, who called the guidelines \u201cirrational\u201d in July, when Mr. Caspersen pleaded guilty. But not all of Mr. Caspersen\u2019s more than a dozen victims have submitted letters of support. Notably, Mr. Shechtman\u2019s filing did not include a letter from Louis Bacon, the billionaire hedge fund manager, whose foundation had given nearly $25 million to Mr. Caspersen. Mr. Caspersen\u2019s tale has confounded Wall Street, where he was known and liked, blending in with many of his associates who came from   backgrounds. In many ways, his privileged background (he attended Groton and Princeton before Harvard) helped him to keep up a scheme for years before anyone noticed. The stock trading addiction began at Princeton, Mr. Shechtman said, but was amplified by a $2. 7 million distribution that Mr. Caspersen received from a family trust in 1999, when he was at Harvard. Over the following years Mr. Caspersen received another distribution, which he lost as well. Soon, he turned to friends and family for investments, getting a million dollars here, several million dollars there. Money came easily from his network, and for years, he papered over the losses by bringing in new money. As recently as February, Mr. Caspersen  \u2014   who was at that point a successful executive working at the Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners  \u2014   made so much money trading stock options that he could have paid back everyone and still had as much as $60 million left for himself. Instead, he continued to trade, losing it all. Mr. Caspersen kept his compulsive stock trading from friends and families. He even persuaded his wife that they should file separate tax returns, largely to keep his frequent trading a secret, according to court filings. But Mr. Caspersen\u2019s facade began to unravel this year. A former Wall Street options trader who reviewed Mr. Caspersen\u2019s trading records at Mr. Shechtman\u2019s request said the option trading \u201clacked rationality. \u201d \u201cIf the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results,\u201d said Bruce Rosen, a former managing director at Tiger Ventures Capital, \u201cthen Mr. Caspersen\u2019s options trading was not that of a sane person. \u201d Still, Mr. Caspersen has his defenders. \u201cAndrew has always treated me with respect,\u201d wrote John Colby, a doorman at the Manhattan apartment building where Mr. Caspersen lives with his wife and their two children. Mr. Colby described how during a shift on Thanksgiving several years ago, Mr. Caspersen and his wife brought Mr. Colby Thanksgiving dinner \u201con a real plate, with a real glass and napkin and silverware,\u201d adding that the gesture was \u201cvery touching to me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628584.217046}
