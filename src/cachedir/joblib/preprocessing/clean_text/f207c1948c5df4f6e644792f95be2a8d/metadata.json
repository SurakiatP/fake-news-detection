He was working on a sequel to his 2003 best seller \u201cMoneyball,\u201d which chronicled how the Oakland A\u2019s general manager Billy Beane revolutionized the sport by using statistics to evaluate players. \u201cI thought I was going to show where the revolution went,\u201d he said. Mr. Lewis tracked the players for two years, but the sequel never went anywhere. By then, \u201cMoneyball\u201d had become huge  \u2014   it has now sold more than 1. 7 million copies  \u2014   and the subject felt overexposed. So instead of tracking where the revolution went, Mr. Lewis decided to explore how it started. The inquiry led him to the work of two Israeli psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, whose discoveries challenged   beliefs about human nature and the way the mind works. Mr. Lewis chronicles their unusual partnership in his new book, \u201cThe Undoing Project,\u201d a story about two unconventional thinkers who saw the world differently from everyone around them. Their peculiar area of research  \u2014   how humans make decisions, often irrationally  \u2014   has had profound implications for an array of fields, like professional sports, the military, medicine, politics, finance and public health. It helped explain why a simple algorithm is often better than the most experienced doctors at diagnosing stomach cancer, why so many financial experts failed to foresee the implosion of the housing market, and why professional basketball teams make costly errors when picking players  \u2014   in short, why people\u2019s instincts are often so wildly wrong. In 2002, Mr. Kahneman won the Nobel in economic science, a field he had no formal training in, for demonstrating how people make decisions when faced with risks and uncertainty. (When asked if their work had any application to artificial intelligence, Mr. Tversky, who died in 1996, countered that they were more interested in exploring \u201cnatural stupidity. \u201d) When he began digging into their research, Mr. Lewis found an even more compelling story about a fertile intellectual partnership that ended too soon, when Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky had a   over who was receiving more credit for their discoveries. \u201cIt\u2019s a love story,\u201d Mr. Lewis said during an interview in Manhattan this fall. \u201cIt\u2019s this bromance of such great intensity, with such fertility, and the children are ideas, the children live on. \u201d \u201cThe Undoing Project,\u201d which will be released on Tuesday, seems like a departure for Mr. Lewis, whose   works have largely been   narratives that reveal something unexpected about the way markets work. Often, they feature eccentrics and visionaries who see things that others are blind to  \u2014   like Mr. Beane of the A\u2019s, or Michael Burry, the misanthropic hedge fund manager in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d who made a fortune by betting against the housing market. \u201cThe Undoing Project\u201d centers on psychology, a field Mr. Lewis, a financial journalist who once worked as a Wall Street bond salesman, knew next to nothing about. \u201cI had cold feet about this, for very good reasons,\u201d he said. On closer inspection, though, it becomes obvious that Mr. Kahneman\u2019s and Mr. Tversky\u2019s research shaped many of the subjects that Mr. Lewis has explored, to an almost unsettling degree. \u201cDanny and Amos\u2019s work has something to say about why baseball players get misvalued, or why people can\u2019t see the value of Michael Oher in \u2018The Blind Side,\u2019 or why people can\u2019t see what   securities really are,\u201d he said. In a roundabout way, their work influenced Mr. Lewis\u2019s career. Their research demonstrating how people behave in fundamentally irrational ways when making decisions, relying on their gut rather than available data, gave rise to the field of behavioral economics. That discipline attracted Paul DePodesta, a Harvard student, who later went into sports management and helped upend professional baseball when he went to work for Mr. Beane. \u201cWithout their basic work, Michael Lewis doesn\u2019t get to write \u2018Moneyball,\u2019\u201d Starling Lawrence, Mr. Lewis\u2019s editor at W. W. Norton, said of Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky. It wasn\u2019t until Mr. Lewis read a 2003 review of \u201cMoneyball\u201d in The New Republic, which mentioned the connection between Mr. Kahneman\u2019s and Mr. Tversky\u2019s research and the data revolution in baseball, that he realized the extent to which their work had shaped the book. He became fascinated with their research and their unique partnership. Four years later, he finally worked up the nerve to call Mr. Kahneman and request a meeting. It is hard to imagine Mr. Lewis, 56, feeling skittish around anyone. A New Orleans native, he comes across as someone who is at ease in any situation, whether he is shadowing professional athletes and coaches,   derivatives traders or bigwigs at the International Monetary Fund. After studying art history at Princeton and getting a master\u2019s degree from the London School of Economics, he worked at Salomon Brothers selling bonds. He left to write \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker,\u201d his 1989 memoir about his experience on Wall Street, which he sold to Mr. Lawrence at W. W. Norton. They have worked together ever since, on more than a dozen books. Unlike many nonfiction writers, Mr. Lewis declines to take advances, which he calls \u201ccorrupting,\u201d even though he could easily earn seven figures. Instead, he splits the profits from the books, as well as the advertising and production costs, with Norton. The setup spurs him to work harder and to make more money if the books are successful, he says. \u201cYou should have the risk and you should enjoy the reward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy for an author not to have the risk. \u201d Mr. Lewis\u2019s books have sold more than nine million copies, and three have been adapted into successful feature films. Norton is printing nearly 500, 000 hardcover copies of \u201cThe Undoing Project. \u201d Other authors speak about him with admiration bordering on reverence. \u201cHis willingness to jump in and take on these topics that are incredibly difficult to represent on the page has always left me \u201d the New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single book he\u2019s written that I thought I could have pulled off myself. \u201d \u201cThe Undoing Project\u201d  \u2014   which tackles abstract concepts like utility theory, prospect theory and heuristics  \u2014   may be Mr. Lewis\u2019s most arcane and ambitious undertaking to date. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you write a book about a couple of psychologists,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, it\u2019s not promising in another writer\u2019s hands. \u201d When Mr. Lewis first met Mr. Kahneman in 2007, over coffee at Mr. Kahneman\u2019s house in Berkeley, Calif. where Mr. Lewis also lives, he had no intention of writing a book about him. Instead, he found himself offering writing advice to Mr. Kahneman, who was struggling with his own book, which laid out his theories about human cognition and decision making. \u201cHe would say, \u2018It\u2019s going to ruin my reputation. I don\u2019t know why I agreed to do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cAt some point I said, \u2018If you\u2019re not going to do it, I\u2019m going to write something. \u2019\u201d Mr. Kahneman\u2019s literary agent vetoed that idea. In 2011, Mr. Kahneman reluctantly published his book, \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow. \u201d It sold about 1. 5 million copies. Despite the book\u2019s success, Mr. Lewis felt the story was incomplete. Mr. Kahneman had largely left out a huge piece of the narrative  \u2014   his own biography and his complicated relationship with Mr. Tversky. Mr. Lewis continued to lobby Mr. Kahneman to let him write about their work. Mr. Kahneman was ambivalent, arguing that the book would read like a textbook. \u201cI said, \u2018You don\u2019t understand what a good character you are, and the fact that you don\u2019t understand it is part of what makes you a good character,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lewis said. It took a few years, but Mr. Kahneman finally acquiesced. \u201cHe\u2019s a pessimist, so he thought it would come out terribly,\u201d said Richard H. Thaler, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a longtime friend of both Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky. \u201cDanny needed to be convinced and charmed, and Michael was up to the task. \u201d Over the next eight years, as he completed other books, Mr. Lewis spent countless hours with Mr. Kahneman, hiking in the hills surrounding Berkeley, traveling to Israel with him twice, and meeting at his apartment in Manhattan. He also dug through Mr. Tversky\u2019s archives and correspondence, with the help of his widow, Barbara Tversky. People close to both men, including Mr. Thaler and Ms. Tversky, say Mr. Lewis captured the intensity of their relationship and their individual quirks. Colleagues described how the pair would finish each other\u2019s sentences and could often be heard cackling from behind an office door as they wrote dense academic papers. Mr. Tversky was the bold one who delighted in undermining   dogma within psychology. Mr. Kahneman was cautious, sensitive and deeply pessimistic. A few of the more colorful details in the book stray from reality, said Ms. Tversky, who praised Mr. Lewis for getting the \u201cbroad strokes right. \u201d For example, Ms. Tversky disputed a delightful anecdote about how her husband was so immune to social convention that he would strip down to his underwear and run outside when he felt like getting exercise. Actually, he would on occasion run on the treadmill in his underwear, but never outside, she said. Mr. Kahneman, now 82, declined to be interviewed for this article, but offered a statement through his publisher. \u201cNaturally, there are points on which I would quibble, but this is Michael\u2019s book, not mine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome things in the book surprised me, some hurt, but I am glad it was written, and grateful to Michael for writing it. In the course of many conversations and countless email exchanges I came to understand the defining chapter of my life better than I had understood it before. \u201d Mr. Lewis said he expected Mr. Kahneman to have a complex reaction to it. \u201cIt would be out of character for Danny just to like it, because he doesn\u2019t like much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would not be out of character for Danny to be kind and come to terms with it in a condescending way, like, that\u2019s the best he could do, and I admire him for trying as hard as he could. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563742.407527}
