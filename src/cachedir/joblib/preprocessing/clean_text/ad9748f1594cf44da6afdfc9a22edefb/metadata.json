[In a statement posted to his blog site, David Chillingworth, the Primus of the Church appeared to strongly rebuke Kelvin Holdsworth, the Provost of St Mary\u2019s Episcopal Cathedral, Glasgow, where the reading took place, arguing that interfaith work, \u201clike all works of reconciliation, must be founded on truth. \u201d He continued: \u201cWe approach others with open hearts but we stand in the truth of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. \u201d  However, no apology for the reading has been forthcoming Chillingworth reasoning that the \u201cThe decisions which have led to the situation in St Mary\u2019s Cathedral are a matter for the Provost and the Cathedral community. \u201d He added that the church will \u201cbring together all those who are involved in the development of interfaith relations\u201d to explore how the work can be carried out \u201cin ways which will command respect. \u201d Holdsworth himself is unrepentent, writing in a blog post that \u201clocal Muslim friends\u201d were invited \u201cas we were reflecting on the arrival of the mysterious Magi at Bethlehem\u201d. The significance is unclear, as the Magi, predating Islam by some six centuries, were Zoroastrian. He continued: \u201cHaving a recitation from the Qur\u2019an in a Christian cathedral in worship is not a new thing. \u201cSo it has indeed come as something of a surprise to find accounts of last week\u2019s service appearing online and stirring up the most most incredible pot of hatred I\u2019ve ever encountered. \u201cThis same Qur\u2019anic reading has been given before in services and no outcry has happened. Is it because this is in a cathedral run by a gay man? Is it because the recitation was given by a young woman? \u201cClearly those things are factors as they feature in some of the abuse. \u201d Confirming that some of the messages received by the church had been reported to Police Scotland, Holdsworth added: \u201cThey assure me that intolerance and prejudice will not be tolerated in Scotland. To put it simply, I thank God for them and their work. \u201d The matter came to light after St Mary\u2019s posted a video of verses of the Quran being sung in Arabic during a service to Facebook, along with a message calling it a \u201cwonderful event. \u201d Both the Facebook post and a YouTube version of the reading have since been removed by the Cathedral, after it provoked widespread anger and criticism from Christians, who pointed out that the verses chosen denied the divinity of Jesus Christ as the Son of God. The reading can still be viewed elsewhere on Facebook via Madinah Javed, who sang the passages during the service. There was further anger as it emerged that a translation of the verses printed in the Order of Service and handed out to congregants omitted the last two, in which the denial came, leading to confusion. Commenting on matter on the Archbishop Cranmer blogsite, the Rev\u2019d Dr Gavin Ashenden, Chaplain to the Queen, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what was in the mind of the Provost of Glasgow Cathedral when he arranged for this assault on Jesus and the apostles. \u201cThe accusation of lying or deception [contained within the verses] was not just directed towards Jesus and the Apostles but is also [  \u2026    ] to those, too, who have been martyred at the hands of Islam, because they refused to renounce this deception when confronted with it. \u201d Refuting Holdworth\u2019s claims that the reading was part of an interfaith dialogue between Islam and Christianity, Ashenden continued: \u201cThere was no dialogue in the Epiphany Eucharist only a refutation of what Christians hold most dear and upon which salvation depends. \u201cIn over 30 years of interfaith conversations, I have never yet come across a Muslim community which allowed those passages in the Gospels acclaiming the divinity of Christ to be read in Friday prayers. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563695.2143118}
