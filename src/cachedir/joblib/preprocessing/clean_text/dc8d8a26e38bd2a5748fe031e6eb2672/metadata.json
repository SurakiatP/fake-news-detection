I discovered what the source was when I attended the Sam Adam\u2019s whistleblower award in Washington. The source of these emails comes from within official circles in Washington DC. You should look to Washington not to Moscow.\u201d\\nAsked about whether or not WikiLeaks have ever published information at the behest of Moscow, Murray said that \u201cWikiLeaks has never published any material received from the Russian government or from any proxy of the Russian government. It\u2019s simply a completely untrue claim designed to divert attention from the content of the material.\u201d\\nWhile blasted by Washington, first by Republicans several years ago, and most recently by Democrats, the WikiLeaks revelations have often been hailed as a champion of accountability.\\n\u201cI think whistleblowers have become extremely important in the West because the propaganda model \u2014 as Chomsky puts it \u2014 has been reinforced to the extent that people don\u2019t get any true information out of the media at all. It\u2019s worth saying that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks are publishers; they publish what whistleblowers leak to them,\u201d Mr. Murrary told Sputnik.\\nYet, whistleblowers in the US continue to be subject to lengthy prison sentences. A key example is Chelsea Manning, who was sentenced on August 21, 2013 to a thirty five year sentence for providing WikiLeaks with sensitive military and diplomatic documents highlighting, among other things, US military conduct in Iraq. Murray also mentions the case of John Kiriakou, a former investigator of international terrorism with the CIA who turned whistleblower.\\n\u201cThe people who did the torture have suffered no comeback at all,\u201d adds Mr. Murray.\\nTaking a step back and discussing the risk of geopolitical escalation between Russia and the US, Murray told Sputnik that \u201cthere is no chance whatsoever that Russia is going to ever attack the United States, that simply isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\\n\u201cJust as Russia is not going to attack the United Kingdom. There never has been a chance that Russia would ever attack either of these two countries. But of course the narrative is all to do with power and funneling huge amounts of American taxpayer money into the defense industry and the security industry and these people are both from the class that benefits.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s an extremely dangerous game, says Mr. Murray, and it feeds into a foreign policy that is completely mad.\\n\u201cIn Syria \u2014 and I should say I\u2019m no fan of the Assad regime at all \u2014 but the idea that backing assorted groups of jihadists to tear the country apart is a better solution is crazy and it\u2019s especially crazy when we\u2019ve already messed up Iraq, Afghanistan and now we\u2019re doing exactly the same thing again and you can see it doesn\u2019t work, it only works in terms of promoting continued instability and continued spending for the military and the security services.\u201d\\nFinally, Murray also believes that the public can\u2019t get clear analysis of these issues from mainstream media, because they are part of the same money/power nexus.\\n'"}, "time": 1742561996.4262166}
