Now all the electors are starting to get beaten down. There are some electors who have been threatened with harm or with death,\u201d Texas elector Alex Kim told NBC 5. \u201cWhen people ask me to vote for Hillary Clinton, there\u2019s no way,\u201d he said. \u201cI reject the Democratic Party principles and I reject Hillary Clinton .\u201d Kim said he had a message for all the people who are trying to pressure him into changing his vote; \u201cGo to hell\u201d. Hillary Supporters Send Death Threats to Electors: As we previously reported , another elector in Michigan said he has also received a number of death threats, including a promise that he would be shot in the head if he voted for Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve had people talk about shoving a gun in my mouth and blowing my brains out. And I\u2019ve received dozens and dozens of those emails. Even the non-threatening-my-life emails are very aggressive,\u201d Michael Banerian told the Detroit News, adding that he has been labeled a \u201chateful bigot\u201d by the same people who are violently threatening him. A petition to demand electors change their vote to Clinton has also surpassed 4.5 million signatures. Meanwhile on Twitter , Hillary supporters are organizing on how to pressure electors under the hashtag #HamiltonElectors , a reference to Mike Pence being lectured by a cast member of the musical show. Unfortunately for them, conservatives found the hashtag and have now largely taken it over to decry leftists attempting to overturn the results of a democratic election. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  '"}, "time": 1742562082.2153585}
