[Asked if the executive order is \u201ca contravention of the Jeffersonian notion of separation of church and state,\u201d said Perkins, \u201cactually, I think it\u2019s in compliance with Thomas Jefferson\u2019s view that the government shouldn\u2019t be meddling in the business of the church. \u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening, increasingly,\u201d added Perkins. \u201cThe wall, so to speak, that\u2019s been breached hasn\u2019t been breached by the church, its been breached by the government getting involved   \u2026     I mean, when you have the government telling churches that they have to provide for elective abortion coverage in their health care plans, regardless of what their faith view is of human life   \u2026     that\u2019s the government meddling in the business of the church. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
