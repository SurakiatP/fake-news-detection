Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. \\nIn an Oct. 24 response , Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch\u2019s behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. \\nThe response from the attorney general\u2019s office is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to \u201cessentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her] role in providing cash to the world\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch, according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon . \\nThe inquiry launched by the lawmakers is just one of several concurrent ongoing congressional probes aimed at unearthing a full accounting of the administration\u2019s secret negotiations with Iran. \\n\u201cIt is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people\u2019s elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cYour staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.\u201d \\n\u201cAs the United States\u2019 chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries,\u201d they stated. \u201cThe actions of your department come at time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison.\u201d \\nThe lawmakers included a copy of their previous 13 questions and are requesting that Lynch provide answers by Nov. 4. \\nWhen asked about Lynch\u2019s efforts to avoid answering questions about the cash payment, Pompeo told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration has blocked Congress at every turn as lawmakers attempt to investigate the payments to Iran. \\n\u201cWho knew that simple questions regarding Attorney General Lynch\u2019s approval of billions of dollars in payments to Iran could be so controversial that she would refuse to answer them?\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThis has become the Obama administration\u2019s coping mechanism for anything related to the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2014hide information, obfuscate details, and deny answers to Congress and the American people.\u201d \\n\u201cThey know this isn\u2019t a sustainable strategy, however, and I trust they will start to take their professional, and moral, obligations seriously,\u201d the lawmaker added\u2026. \\nCourtesy of Pamela Geller  '"}, "time": 1742561737.8339584}
