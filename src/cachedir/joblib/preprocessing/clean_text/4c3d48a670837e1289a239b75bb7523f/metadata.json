But unlike some approachable actresses, who stick with the pretty if bland aesthetic, Ms. Stone is as soign\u00e9e as they come. \u201cShe\u2019s very spirited when it comes to fashion,\u201d said Petra Flannery, her stylist for the past decade. \u201cShe\u2019s a very animated person, and my goal is to make the clothes complement all of that, whether it\u2019s through color, or a material that makes it unique, or an interesting design. \u201d It helps that like the variety of characters she inhabits  \u2014   Ms. Stone is nominated for an Oscar in the best actress category for the   musical film \u201cLa La Land\u201d  \u2014   she has range. She comes alive in marigold (a flirty,   Gucci creation at a W magazine party last month, which Ms. Flannery called \u201cthe ultimate party dress\u201d) sky blue (a   Prada dress at the Los Angeles \u201cLa La Land\u201d premiere in December) and even pale sea foam (a shimmering Atelier Versace gown at the Venice Film Festival in September, which seemed to have gone through a very expensive shredder). Strange proportions are also fair game. At the EE British Academy Film Awards, familiarly known as the Baftas, this month, Ms. Stone managed to make a   embroidered smoke gray organza dress over    pants (Chanel haute couture, mind you) seem like kismet. \u201cThe look was so cool because of the pants, but also it was a little Lucille Ball because of the \u201950s shape of the dress,\u201d Ms. Flannery said. It was not the first time Ms. Stone carried off a tricky Chanel design  \u2014   or pants on the red carpet, for that matter. While an ornate embroidered jacket and a heavy silver and gold column skirt, both in tweed, might have sapped the youth out of some, Ms. Stone was a sophisticated jeune fille in the Chanel M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art outfit she wore to the Paris premiere of \u201cLa La Land. \u201d Yet Ms. Stone doesn\u2019t overdose on opulence. Like a palate cleanser, the actress peppered her red carpet look with minimal slip dresses (a rich burgundy number by the Row for the London premiere of \u201cLa La Land\u201d in January and a strappy black Stella McCartney design at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival this month). Another Stella McCartney, a midnight blue jumpsuit worn to the Oscar Nominees Luncheon a few days later, was also relatively spare, though the puffed   cut had plenty of quirk. \u201cI always want to keep it fresh and fun,\u201d Ms. Flannery said. To that end, she works with a combination of custom and runway pieces. \u201cI love doing custom, because it\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re really surprising people,\u201d she said, pointing to the glittering   Valentino gown Ms. Stone wore to the Golden Globes last month. Sourcing directly from the runway used to be the gold standard, but, Ms. Flannery said, \u201cit\u2019s different today with social media. \u201d \u201cInstagram images pop up all over,\u201d she continued, \u201cand by the time a dress comes from the runway, it can feel like you\u2019ve seen it already. \u201d Luckily, Ms. Flannery has such access  \u2014   Ms. Stone, after all, is a red carpet score for any designer  \u2014   that she can nab a collection piece before it has ever left the studio. Such was the case when she secured the remarkable Alexander McQueen dress with lily pad embroidery that Ms. Stone wore to the Screen Actors Guild Awards in January. With asymmetrical draping and a lace bodice, the design was a visual feat: Ms. Stone looked as though she was partially undressed. Ms. Flannery said the gown was from the label\u2019s 2017   collection, which \u201chad not been viewed by anybody yet. \u201d She reserved the piece a couple of weeks before the awards ceremony as she was passing through London with Ms. Stone. \u201cIt\u2019s true designers love her,\u201d Ms. Flannery said, \u201cbut also Emma appreciates fashion from an artist\u2019s point of view. Style is innate. It\u2019s in her bones. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564514.9416456}
