Now 46, she served loyally for a decade as deputy to Alex Salmond, both in the Scottish National Party and later in government, before becoming Scotland\u2019s leader after the failure of the independence referendum of September 2014, when Mr. Salmond resigned. Now, after Britain as a whole voted to leave the European Union while Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain, Ms. Sturgeon is patiently laying out a path for another independence referendum, using Prime Minister Theresa May as her foil. \u201cThe U. K. government has decided to remove Scotland not just from the European Union but from the single market as well, and that\u2019s clearly against the will of the majority of people who live here,\u201d she said Friday, as she sent a formal letter to Mrs. May, with the support of the Scottish Parliament, asking for another referendum. Mrs. May has already said the referendum cannot happen before Britain leaves the European Union, two years from now. Their meetings are \u201cbusinesslike\u201d and \u201ccordial,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said in an interview on Friday in Bute House, Scotland\u2019s No. 10 Downing Street. But hardly warm. Meeting Mrs. May in Glasgow on Monday, \u201cwe were very keen to try to strike a compromise that would have reconciled the fact that the U. K. voted to leave the E. U. and Scotland voted to remain,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said. \u201cBut there was not a willingness to compromise on her part. \u201d That was hardly unexpected, Ms. Sturgeon admitted. \u201cIt would have been na\u00efve on my part\u201d not to factor in Mrs. May\u2019s refusal to countenance a referendum before the process of Britain\u2019s departure from Europe, or Brexit, is finished, she said. But Ms. Sturgeon intends to press ahead, promising to tell her Parliament in April of plans to keep up momentum for what she calls \u201can act of democratic \u201d noting that Mrs. May cited the same principle to explain Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. \u201cWhen the time is right,\u201d when the Brexit negotiations produce greater clarity about the future, \u201cand we\u2019re able to set out in light of changed circumstances what independence would mean for Scotland, then Scotland gets to take that informed choice before it\u2019s too late,\u201d she said. It will be for those living in Scotland to decide, she insisted, not the Parliament in London. Since Scots voted down independence, 55 percent to 45 percent, the Scottish National Party has grown enormously with many Scots getting politicized by the bitter campaign. With some 25, 000 members in September 2014, her party now has more than 125, 000, Ms. Sturgeon said. A second referendum would probably put the independence camp in a better position than three years ago, when young people voted heavily to leave, and a British exit from the European Union seemed highly unlikely. But while Scots voted to remain in the European Union last June by 62 percent to 38 percent, that has not translated easily into support for independence, with about a third of those favoring independence also voting for a British exit. \u201cRight now there\u2019s too much uncertainty, not just about Scotland but about Brexit,\u201d said Ian Ramage, who returned to Edinburgh a decade ago after many years living abroad. \u201cBrexit to me is like going back in time, but nobody\u2019s certain about anything just now. \u201d Chris Deerin, a Scottish political analyst, said that Ms. Sturgeon \u201cis both stuck and in charge. \u201d She would not want another referendum so soon in any case, he said, and can now blame Mrs. May and Westminster, always a popular tactic here. But for Ms. Sturgeon, it would be important to try to have the vote before the next Scottish parliamentary elections in 2021, when the   S. N. P. might lose more seats, in the normal cycle of politics. Ms. Sturgeon is essentially using the same \u201ctake back control\u201d argument that leave supporters used in the European Union referendum, only one of the ironies involved, as Mrs. May works to leave one union while maintaining another  \u2014   the United Kingdom. And while Scotland wants to preserve free trade with the European Union, it must also keep free trade with the rest of Britain too, which in 2015 represented 63 percent of Scotland\u2019s trade, compared with 16 percent with the rest of the European Union. But trade with the bloc, Ms. Sturgeon pointed out, still represents more than 40 percent of Scotland\u2019s \u201cinternational trade. \u201d The Scottish nationalists are winning the emotional argument, Mr. Deerin said, \u201cbut the biggest hurdle the S. N. P. has to climb now is financial. \u201d A serious discussion of how an independent Scotland would finance itself will be crucial to winning a second referendum, he said. Since 2014, Scotland\u2019s oil and gas revenues have plunged precipitously, from some 9. 6 billion pounds in the   fiscal year to just 60 million pounds in  . And it may shrink further given the high costs of extraction while the price of oil is low. Scotland\u2019s rate of growth is about a third of Britain\u2019s, at less than 1 percent a year, and its budget deficit is twice that of Britain\u2019s. Ms. Sturgeon acknowledges the problems, saying that she has commissioned Andrew Wilson, an economist and former S. N. P. legislator, to do a study of how Scotland can manage its finances. \u201cWe have to deal with the deficit whether we\u2019re an independent country or not, and the question is whether we have greater ability to deal with it as an independent country, and I believe we do,\u201d she said. But she would like to cut the deficit \u201cin a way compatible with our values as a country, because what we\u2019re finding now is that the deficit is being reduced consistent with the values of a Conservative government in Westminster that is leading to austerity. \u201d Mr. Wilson\u2019s study is just another example of how Ms. Sturgeon is proceeding to try to answer the questions raised in the last referendum and win a second one, which will probably determine her own political fate. Similarly, she said clearly that an independent Scotland would want to join the European Union but not use the euro, arguing that Sweden managed to join the bloc while opting out of the single currency. What money Scotland would use remains unclear, a major issue in the last referendum campaign after Britain said that an independent Scotland could not use the pound. Nor would she be drawn on whether an independent Scotland could achieve its aims by joining the economic grouping shared by Norway, which has access to the bloc\u2019s single market in return for budget contributions and freedom of movement and labor of European Union citizens, but is short of membership. Ms. Sturgeon spoke before leaving for a week in New York and California, to promote Scottish business, investment and culture. \u201cThe links between Scotland and America are so deep and multifaceted, but it\u2019s important to work at strengthening them,\u201d she said. And that includes someone\u2019s mother? She laughed at the clear reference to President Trump, who speaks proudly of his Scottish mother. \u201cLook, lots of people are very proud of Scottish connections, so I\u2019m delighted that people want to highlight them,\u201d she said, laughing again. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be stopped at the airport going in. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563613.681743}
