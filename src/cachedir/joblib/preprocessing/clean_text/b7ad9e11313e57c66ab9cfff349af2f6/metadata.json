Rothman, who regulates the state\u2019s insurers, is an appointee under Governor Mark Dayton, a Democrat. The rate hike follows increases for this year of 14 percent to 49 percent. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s in an emergency situation \u2014 we worked hard and avoided a collapse.\u201d Rothman said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a stopgap for 2017.\u201d \\nOn average, rates in the state will rise by about 60 percent, said Shane Delaney, a spokesman for MNSure, the state\u2019s marketplace for Obamacare plans. About 250,000 people, or 5 percent of the state\u2019s population, were covered under plans bought on the individual market, including plans bought on the Affordable Care Act markets as well as outside it. \\nLie of the Day \\nThe lie of the day comes from Jonathan Gold, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \\nMinnesotans would still have affordable options for coverage next year said Gold. \u201cHeadline rate changes do not reflect what these consumers actually pay because tax credits reduce the cost of coverage below the sticker price.\u201d \\nOf the about 70,000 people who had insurance on the Obamacare markets this year, 63 percent got subsidies last year, according to the commissioner\u2019s office. \\nFor at least 37% of Minnesotans Obamacare is hugely unaffordable. For those who got small subsidies, Obamacare is hugely unaffordable. We do not have breakdowns by subsidy amount, but I suspect at lest 65% do not feel Obamcare is affordable. \\nThose nearly broke with massive subsidies may view Obamacare as \u201caffordable\u201d. Businesses sure don\u2019t and neither do those who get little or no subsidies. \\nAlso in the not-affordable class are millions of healthy millennials who have to dramatically overpay so that a small subset of people benefit mightily. \\nGovernment in Action Government in action:Obamacare was supposed to increase competition and reduce costs. Instead it decreased competition and increased costs. \u2014 Mike Mish Shedlock (@MishGEA) November 1, 2016  '"}, "time": 1742561835.7920558}
