[Normally, any allegation of mistreatment of a minority, even those of dubious provenance like 2015\u2019s \u201cClock Boy\u201d incident, will be met with an instant wave of reflexive   virtue signalling from celebrities on social media.  Yet this strangely does not seem to apply to the Christian minority in the Middle East, the   persecution of whom occurs on a regular basis. It\u2019s not because of any Anglocentrism on Hollywood\u2019s part  \u2014   celebrities regularly present themselves as advocates for oppressed groups in the third world, from Rwandans to refugees from Darfur. So why not Christians? Particularly the Coptic Christians, who have been in the Middle East since the time of Christ and are somewhat similar to Native Americans  \u2014   an ancient people who were sidelined by militarily superior and often brutal colonizers. Listed below are seven celebrities who regularly speak out against the alleged persecution of minorities, including Muslims, refugees, the LGBT community and more. Yet so far, they have said nothing about today\u2019s massacre of Coptic Christians. 1. Katy Perry, Katy Perry, in response to the brutal Muslim attack on fellow songstress Ariana Grande\u2019s concert in Manchester, urged for \u201cbarriers and borders\u201d to be removed, and for everyone to \u201ccoexist. \u201d She also worries about the persecution of minorities. Following the election of Donald Trump, she produced a PSA featuring a Muslim woman discussing the internment of   during World War II, warning viewers not to let \u201chistory repeat itself. \u201d A UNICEF goodwill ambassador, Perry also cares about oppression in nonwestern countries. So, as someone who 1) recently saw a friend\u2019s concert attacked by an Islamic extremist, 2) worries about the mistreatment of minorities, and 3) is concerned with oppression in the third world, surely Perry must be alarmed by the massacre of Coptic Christians, by an Islamic extremist, in Egypt. Yet so far, Katy Perry\u2019s feeds on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram say nothing about the massacre. Maybe she just forgot to have an intern read her the headlines this morning. 2. Bill Nye, The \u201cScience Guy\u201d with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Engineering declares in the title of his new Netflix show that he is going to \u201cSave The World. \u201d And, true to his word, the show is packed with     crusades, from   climate change to sticking up for the right of such overlooked minorities as \u201cflirty pansexual  . \u201d One would think that someone who knows of such obscure minorities would have a little time to Save the World from the persecution of religious minorities, but so far, the         has said nothing about today\u2019s massacre of Egyptian Christians. 3. Kumail Nanjiani, One of the most outspoken progressives on social media, the    Muslim comedian has said just about everything. He\u2019s said climate change deniers are worse than Holocaust deniers, he\u2019s accused President Trump of \u201cbreeding evil\u201d with his repeatedly blocked proposals on Muslim immigration, and he of course Stood With Ahmed. Nanjiani, who frequently complains about his own condition as a famous   celebrity oppressed Muslim minority, makes it clear that we should speak out against bigotry at every opportunity: We can\u2019t let     be normalized. If something happens, be safe, but let it be known we won\u2019t stand for this.  \u2014   Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) November 12, 2016,  That\u2019s why, as a prominent Muslim with a massive platform, it must only be a matter of time before he speaks out against the murderous bigotry currently being faced by Egypt\u2019s Christian minority. Let\u2019s keep waiting  \u2014   it\u2019s bound to happen soon! 4. Meryl Streep  Another vocal progressive, Streep hates Trump so much she used her acceptance speech for the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes to take shots at the president, suggesting he wants to \u201ckick out foreigners. \u201d She cares about minorities, like gays, people of color, women, and convicted child rapist Roman Polanski so much that the Human Rights Campaign invited her to speak at their annual gala. Streep has yet to say anything about today\u2019s extraordinary violation of human rights in Egypt. 5. George Takei, George Takei has become Hollywood\u2019s   celebrity for boring, mainstream leftist opinions on gay rights. After the Orlando shootings, when 50 attendees of a gay nightclub were shot by a disciple of Islamic State, Takei immediately penned an   calling for more gun control (as opposed to less Islam). He also used the occasion to attack   Donald Trump. Given that he isn\u2019t willing to call out Islam when they target his own community, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that he\u2019s said nothing about the Coptic Christians. Six of his eight tweets today have been devoted to criticism of the Trump administration. None mention the attack in Egypt. 6. Lena Dunham, After the election of Donald Trump, Hollywood\u2019s    penned an essay expressing her support for \u201cthose in the prison system, those with undocumented American relatives, those who are trans, who are queer, who are people of color, who are Muslim, who are trying to prosecute their abusers\u201d who have \u201chave felt the crushing failure of the system over and over again. \u201d That\u2019s a lot of minorities she cares about. But unlike Dunham, who had her feelings hurt by the election of Trump, people actually died today in Egypt. Christian minorities brutalized at the hands of Islam, it seems, have yet to make Dunham\u2019s list. 7. J. K Rowling  Harry Potter author J. K Rowling has emerged as one of the most   celebrities on social media following the election. In addition to repeatedly attacking president Trump, Rowling has repeatedly made it clear that she opposes the mistreatment of minorities, even calling attention to allegedly racist social media attacks on obscure academics. She also regularly comments on European politics, urging the British government in 2015 to take in more refugees from the Middle East. If you can\u2019t imagine yourself in one of those boats, you have something missing. They are dying for a life worth living. #refugeeswelcome,  \u2014   J. K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) September 3, 2015,  You would think that an   advocate like Rowling would jump to call attention to the plight of religious minorities in the Middle East. Such an approach might soften the attitudes of conservatives who oppose taking in refugees from those regions. Yet it\u2019s almost 5pm in the U. K, and Rowling has yet to comment on the violent deaths of more than 20 Coptic Christians. An Unfashionable Minority? Credit where credit is due  \u2014   one prominent progressive, Linda Sarsour, has said the terrorists responsible for today\u2019s attack can \u201crot in an eternal hell. \u201d May the terrorists rot in an eternal hell. Sending love  solidarity to our Coptic sisters and brothers. #Egypt https:  .   \u2014   Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) May 26, 2017,  But she seems to be a lone voice amongst prominent   who rarely miss an opportunity to comment on any perceived injustice against minorities, anywhere in the world. Perhaps persecuted Christians are simply not a fashionable minority. You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter and add him on Facebook.
