Strangers cruise its paved and dirt roads, seeming to drive through just for a look. And come fall, Dean Grissom\u2019s   and    grandchildren will be going to another school. \u201cTheir parents think the kids aren\u2019t safe,\u201d said Mr. Grissom, 57, who works for the Idaho Fish and Game agency. He said that sending the children to classes in Shoshone, eight miles away, was unnecessary in his view, but that he understood the parents\u2019 fears. A town he loves has been damaged. There is a lot of debate here about what happened at the town\u2019s only school on Oct. 23 after a football practice: an assault, a racist attack, bullying, a failure of supervision by school officials, or some combination. Hardly anyone disputes, though, that this town of 350 people has been shaken to the core. State and local prosecutors say that several white football players bullied and brutally assaulted a mentally disabled black teammate in a locker room that October day, shoving a coat hanger into his rectum while other boys held his arms. Two of the players accused in the attack were charged as adults with felony sexual assault and could face life in prison if convicted. A third teammate has been charged as a juvenile. A preliminary hearing on the criminal charges is scheduled for Friday. In addition, a $10 million federal civil suit was filed last month by the boy\u2019s adoptive parents, Tim and Shelly McDaniel, who are white. In it, they accused the school district and its administrators, trustees, employees and volunteers of failing in their legal duty to protect the McDaniels\u2019 son, who they say endured months of racist taunts, humiliation and physical abuse. After the   attack, the boy required treatment at two hospitals for rectal injuries. \u201cThe school district and individual defendants acted with deliberate indifference to the harassment, humiliation, mental and physical abuse and mistreatment of the plaintiff by students of the district and thereby permitted and caused him to be bullied, beaten and raped,\u201d the lawsuit said. In big ways and small, the repercussions of both the crime and the family\u2019s response are already rippling out, no matter what happens in court or at the school, which has 245 students in grades  . Mr. McDaniel, 60, who has taught science at the school for 21 years, put the family\u2019s house up for sale last month and is looking for work elsewhere. The cars and trucks that sometimes slowly cruise by out front, he said, and the funny looks he gets around town have unnerved him and his wife, who is 51. On July 1, a state law allowing Idahoans to carry a concealed weapon without a permit will take effect, and Mr. McDaniel said he planned to be armed after that. \u201cIf I could be gone today, I\u2019d be gone,\u201d he said, sitting outside in the yard on a recent afternoon as dogs wandered about near chicken and goat pens. The McDaniels stood out here in rural Idaho even before the   episode. Over the years, they have adopted 20 children of various races  \u2014   white, Hispanic and black  \u2014   many of them with physical, mental or emotional troubles, including autism and fetal alcohol syndrome. A few years ago, Mr. McDaniel raised hackles by teaching sex education in his science classes with illustrations that some critics said were too graphic, and one of his daughters led a campaign on Facebook to save his job. The legal terrain to come is a minefield in itself, education law experts said. Courts have generally recognized that school officials cannot be everywhere all the time, and have not typically held teachers, administrators or coaches legally responsible for occasional bullying. But that deference can fade when race, religion or disability is involved, said John Dayton, a professor of education law at the University of Georgia. In those cases, courts have sometimes tilted hard the other way, he said, if they find that a clearly vulnerable group or category of students was not sufficiently protected. Other education experts said the central question raised by the McDaniels\u2019 lawsuit  \u2014   whether school officials should be held responsible for failing to stop a culture of bullying before it escalates to violence  \u2014   had become harder to answer as new and different ways of bullying have proliferated. \u201cThe expectation of supervision has increased,\u201d said Ann E. Blankenship, an assistant professor of educational leadership at the University of Southern Mississippi. Technology, she added, \u201copens the door to bullying opportunities 24 hours a day. \u201d Don Heiken, Dietrich\u2019s mayor, has publicly called on the school to fire people involved in the football program, who he said must have been aware that bullying, if not outright racism, was getting worse. The boy, according to his parents\u2019 suit, was stripped of his pants on the bus after one football game, while other students took photos. He was \u201ccontinuously\u201d subjected, the suit said, to \u201cwedgies\u201d  \u2014   his underwear yanked sharply upward, sometimes so violently that he came home with torn shorts. \u201cThey had to have known,\u201d Mr. Heiken said in an interview. It probably did not help, Mr. McDaniel said, that in a school where sports are hugely important, his son was unskilled at football. Unable to remember the plays, the boy was called offsides  \u2014   crossing the scrimmage line before the ball was snapped  \u2014   six or seven times in a row in a single game, his father said. Dietrich itself, about 35 miles from Twin Falls and about 60 miles from the resort community of Sun Valley, is changing and growing, which has become part of the discussion about what happened here. The population has doubled in the last couple of decades and is expected to double again even faster, according to a planning presentation made recently to the town council. Lynn Johnson, 78, said \u201coutsiders,\u201d as he called the wave of newcomers, were changing the town where he has lived for the past 42 years, and not always for the better. Both of the students charged as adults in the case  \u2014   Tanner Ray Ward, 17, and John R. K. Howard, 18  \u2014   were relatively new to the community, for example. The defendant being tried as a juvenile has not been named in court documents. \u201cNeither of them boys are from Dietrich,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who drove a school bus and did maintenance work for the school for 17 years. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened without them. \u201d A lawyer for Mr. Ward declined to comment, and a lawyer for Mr. Howard did not respond to phone messages. The school superintendent and principal, both defendants in the civil suit, did not respond to emails and phone messages. Mr. Grissom, who lives just a few blocks from the school, said that he knew and admired the McDaniel family, and that he thought that admiration was shared in much of the town. That they would move away was one more piece of the damage, he said. \u201cPeople look at this and say a lot of people are prejudiced here,\u201d Mr. Grissom said. \u201cThey\u2019re not. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562092.2684631}
