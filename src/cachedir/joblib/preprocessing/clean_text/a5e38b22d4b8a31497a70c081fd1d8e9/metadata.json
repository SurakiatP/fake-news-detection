Comey, told lawmakers at a Senate hearing on Tuesday that Russian hackers had penetrated the Republican National Committee\u2019s computer records, but he called it a \u201climited penetration of old R. N. C. \u201d computer systems that were \u201cno longer in use. \u201d Mr. Comey\u2019s statement was significant because the committee said weeks ago that it did not lose data to the Russians because of its strong cybersecurity.   Donald J. Trump has repeated that assertion and has also said weaknesses in Democratic National Committee systems had opened the way for their systems to be hacked. While Mr. Comey did not go into detail, he appeared to be referring to a   attack on a contractor in Tennessee, Smartech Corporation, used by the Republican committee to host some of its websites and handle some lists of donors. Federal investigators have said that a single email server used by that contractor had been penetrated. But it was going out of service and contained outdated material that the Russians probably found to be of little value. People with direct knowledge of the server\u2019s contents said it had been used by Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain. An aide in Mr. Graham\u2019s office said the hacking of the email server in question occurred in June. The Graham campaign was using the server to send news clips and campaign releases, the aide said. In an unclassified report released on Friday, the intelligence community reported that the Russians had attacked \u201c \u201d organizations but that they had chosen not to make any of that data public. The report made no specific reference to the Republican National Committee. Pressed on the issue by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Mr. Comey said on Tuesday that there was \u201cevidence of hacking directed at the state level\u201d and at the Republican committee, \u201cbut that it was old stuff. \u201d He said there was no evidence \u201cthat the current R. N. C. \u201d  \u2014   he appeared to be referring to servers at the committee\u2019s headquarters or contractors with current data  \u2014   had been hacked. There is no evidence that computers used by the Trump campaign or the Clinton campaign were also compromised, though the personal email account of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, was copied and released as part of the   hack. The testimony on Tuesday was the first since the release of the declassified report on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and it came four days after the findings were described to Mr. Trump. The panel, convened by the Senate Intelligence Committee, included James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and of the military\u2019s Cyber Command. John O. Brennan, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Mr. Comey also testified. Mr. Clapper largely repeated the conclusions of last week\u2019s report, including that the goal of the Russian effort was to disparage Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   whom the Russians hoped to weaken if she won  \u2014   and over time to favor Mr. Trump. Under questioning, Mr. Clapper said he believed that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his aides had actively ordered the operation that resulted in the hacking, though he left unclear how involved they may have been in the details. After receiving a briefing on the report on Friday, Mr. Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia had sought to hack into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer systems. But he insisted that the effort had played no role in his election, and he said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin preferred him to Mrs. Clinton. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the committee\u2019s vice chairman, called the election hacking \u201cone of the most serious events of my public life. \u201d At times, Democrats on the committee steered the conversation toward whether intelligence officials were investigating any link between the Russians and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. But Mr. Comey declined to discuss it. \u201cEspecially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny any investigation,\u201d Mr. Comey said. Many Democrats still blame him for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat, citing his ambiguous letter less than two weeks before the election disclosing new questions about emails on her private server. Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, who supported Mrs. Clinton, could not resist an aside. \u201cThe irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid,\u201d he said. Mr. Comey, seeking to establish a nonpartisan air, later joked, \u201cI hope I\u2019ve demonstrated by now I\u2019m tone deaf when it comes to politics  \u2014   and that\u2019s the way it should be. \u201d Republicans, for their part, raised few doubts about the intelligence community\u2019s conclusions, but they dwelled little on the report\u2019s finding that Mr. Putin had a clear preference for Mr. Trump. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, suggested that Russia had achieved its broader goal of sowing \u201cchaos and disorder\u201d in the electoral system.'"}, "time": 1742628335.5359726}
