Trump on Tuesday night, he and his millions of supporters completed what had seemed unimaginable: a hostile takeover of one of America\u2019s two major political parties. Just as stunning was how quickly the host tried to reject them. The party\u2019s two living former presidents spurned Mr. Trump, a number of sitting governors and senators expressed opposition or ambivalence toward him, and he drew a forceful rebuke from the single most powerful and popular rival left on the Republican landscape: the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan. Rarely if ever has a party seemed to come apart so visibly. Rarely, too, has the nation been so on edge about its politics. Many Americans still cannot believe that the bombastic Mr. Trump, best known as a reality television star, will be on the ballot in November. Plenty are also anxious about what he would do in office. But for leading Republicans, the dismay is deeper and darker. They fear their party is on the cusp of an epochal split  \u2014   a historic cleaving between the familiar form of conservatism forged in the 1960s and popularized in the 1980s and a rekindled, atavistic nationalism, with roots as old as the republic, that has not flared up so intensely since the original America First movement before Pearl Harbor. Some even point to France and other European countries, where   parties like the National Front have gained power because of the sort of resentments that are frequently given voice at rallies for Mr. Trump. Yet if keeping the peace means embracing Mr. Trump and his most divisive ideas and utterances, a growing number are loath to do it. The ties between Republican elites  \u2014   elected officials, donors and Washington insiders  \u2014   and voters have actually been fraying for years. Traditional power brokers long preached   conservatism and wanted to pursue an immigration overhaul, entitlement cuts, free trade and a hawkish foreign policy, and nominees like John McCain and Mitt Romney largely embraced that agenda. Republican leaders also vilified President Obama and Democrats, stoking anger with    conservatives. Many Republican voters trudged along with those earlier nominees, but never became truly animated until Mr. Trump offered them his brand of angry populism: a blend of protectionism at home and a smaller American footprint abroad. And he was able to exploit their resentments and frustrations because those same Republican leaders had been nurturing those feelings for years with attacks on Mr. Obama, Democrats, illegal immigrants and others. Mr. Trump, with his steadfast promises to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally and to build a wall with Mexico, may have done irreversible damage to his general election prospects. But he quickly earned the trust that so many of those voters had lost in other fixtures of America  \u2014   not just in its leaders, but in institutions like Congress, the Federal Reserve and the   campaign finance system that Mr. Trump has repudiated, as well as in corporations, the Roman Catholic Church and the news media. And he has amplified his independent, outsider message in real time, using social media and cable news interviews  \u2014   and his own celebrity and highly attuned ear for what resonates  \u2014   to rally voters to his side, using communication strategies similar to those deployed in the Arab Spring uprising or in the attempts by liberals and students to foment a similar revolution in Iran. \u201cTrump leveraged a perfect storm,\u201d said Steve Case, the founder of AOL, in an email message. \u201cA combo of social media (big following) brand (celebrity figure) creativity (pithy tweets)   (dominating news cycles). \u201d Mr. Trump is an unlikely spokesman for the grievances of financially struggling, alienated Americans: a   Manhattan billionaire who erects skyscrapers for the wealthy and can easily get politicians on the phone. But as a shrewd business tactician, he understood the Republican Party\u2019s customers better than its leaders did and sensed that his brand of populist, pugilistic,   politics would meet their needs. After seething at Washington for so long, hundreds or thousands of miles from the capital, many of these voters now see Mr. Trump as a kind of savior. Even if he does not detail his policies, even if his language strikes them as harsh sometimes, his supporters thrill more to his   slogans like \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d than to what they see as the cautious and   policy speeches of Mr. Ryan and other Washington Republicans. \u201cI love the death out of Paul Ryan, but honestly, I\u2019m going to vote for Trump anyways,\u201d said David Myers, 49, who attended a campaign rally for Mr. Trump in Charleston, W. Va. on Thursday night. \u201cBecause Paul Ryan, and I love him to death, but he\u2019s one of those career politicians. \u201d Mr. Trump now feels so empowered that he does not think he needs the political support of the party establishment to defeat the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. He is confident that his appeal will be broad and deep enough among voters of all stripes that he could win battleground states like Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania without the support of leaders like Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump said in an interview on Saturday. Although he plans to meet with Mr. Ryan and House Republican leaders on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would not materially change his policies or style to win their endorsements. \u201cEverything is subject to negotiation, but I can\u2019t and won\u2019t be changing much, because the voters support me because of what I\u2019m saying and how I\u2019m saying it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe establishment didn\u2019t do anything to make me the nominee, so its support won\u2019t really make much difference in me winning in November. \u201d (Mr. Trump will, though, be somewhat dependent on the party\u2019s   muscle since he has indicated he will not fully   his general election campaign.) One reason Mr. Trump takes a skeptical view of establishment support is that he does not believe much in the power of the Republican elite. He is the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, after all, because the political forces that once might have halted his rise have been enfeebled. Leaders such as Mr. Romney warned in the direst terms that Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination would stain the party and lead it to ruin. Venerable media outlets on the right, like National Review, sought to reprise their role as arbiters of who is fit to carry the banner of conservatism. Their pleas fell on deaf ears. Mr. Trump\u2019s arsenal was far more fearsome. Combining   fame and an   demagogy, he bypassed the ossified gatekeepers and appealed directly to voters through a constant Twitter stream that seemed interrupted only by television appearances. In doing so, he seemed to grasp that a new twist on direct democracy was in the offing: that disaffected voters who tune out the traditional modes of political communication might be reachable through their smartphones, and Twitter messages or Reddits might be more relevant to those voters than the findings of a more scientific poll. On the left, too, Senator Bernie Sanders has built his own movement with millions of voters, and $210 million in   by using online tools as simple as email to seek support. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s celebrity has been an enormous asset with voters who feel gratified and inspired that he would lavish them with attention and bluntly express some of the ideas and attitudes they share. For 12 consecutive years, polls have indicated that Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, and Republicans have been especially vulnerable to a political campaign like Mr. Trump\u2019s that seeks to channel voter anger. In every state where the question was asked in exit polls during the primary season, 50 percent or more of Republicans said they felt betrayed by their leaders. The adhesive that once held Republicans together  \u2014   a shared commitment to a strong national defense and limited government  \u2014   was weakened by the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. But internal divisions were papered over when new, unifying threats emerged after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. It was not until near the end of President George W. Bush\u2019s second term that those fissures broke open again, first with Mr. Bush\u2019s attempt at an immigration overhaul, including a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and then after the financial rescue of big banks from the 2008 financial collapse. Alongside the turbulent economy were signs of something more profound plaguing   white communities, which have increasingly become core Republican constituencies: an increase in children born to single parents, higher rates of addiction and suicide, and shortened average life spans. \u201cThe economic deprivation of the last 30 years for   whites, combined with growing social isolation, was really dry tinder,\u201d said Robert D. Putnam, the Harvard political scientist who wrote \u201cBowling Alone. \u201d And Mr. Trump, Mr. Putnam contended, \u201clit a spark. \u201d \u201cHe constructed a series of scapegoats that these folks would find plausible,\u201d said Mr. Putnam, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Muslims and immigrants. \u201cHe was willing to say things that might have always been popular, but you couldn\u2019t say it. \u201d With Mr. Trump now saying it loudly and clearly, many Americans feel deeply unsettled by the nation\u2019s politics. Not since Mr. Bush invaded Iraq have so many liberals been murmuring about moving to other countries. And many Republican officials and donors just hope to get through the election with their party intact. \u201cThe party has never been more out of touch with our voters,\u201d Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman, said of the two factions, acknowledging that Republicans could splinter completely after this election. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you reconcile a lot of them. \u201d Mr. Weber expressed hope that Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan would find some common ground. But few in the party now deny that the threat of an enduring split is real. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty clear Trump wing of the party coming to life,\u201d said Barry Wynn, a prominent   who supported Jeb Bush for president and has not yet fallen in behind Mr. Trump. \u201cBut I have to think that four or eight years from now, the Trump wing will be a little more traditional, a little less   and will be blended into the party just like the evangelical Pat Robertson voters were after the 1988 election. \u201d \u201cAt least,\u201d he added, \u201cI hope that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562620.2406652}
