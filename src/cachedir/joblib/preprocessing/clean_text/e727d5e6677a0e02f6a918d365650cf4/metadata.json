They know that sacrifice isn\u2019t just a word, but a set of meanings associated with that particular word. \\n2. They ate two raw eggs every morning, two raw eggs in the afternoon, and two raw eggs after sundown, because that\u2019s just what you did. \\n3. They were 40 feet tall, with long, terrible teeth, and arms thick as a clipper\u2019s mast! And their awful strength was matched only by their appetites! \\n4. They know that this is the best way to tie a tie: \\n5. They were married by age 18, had a house by 20, sucked the tongue out of a jackal\u2019s mouth by 23, had their arms and legs ripped off on the radio by 25, and did it all over again by 36. \\n6. Some of them were named \u201cLeland,\u201d which is wild. \\n7. They could get under the hood of any car and tell you exactly how they\u2019d fuck it. \\n8.

They\u2019re definitely the last generation to ever witness this in person: \\n14. Many of them live underground. Pretty impressive! \\n15. Their ranks include Frank Sinatra, John Travolta\u2019s dad, and Dagwood from Blondie . \\n16. They never left a man behind. That\u2019s why we have Bruce. \\n17. They fought for civil rights, but also against civil rights, but they won the fight, but they really tried pretty hard to shut that fight down, so maybe that one\u2019s kind of a wash. \\n18. They probably invented tarp, the outdoor silk. \\n19. They learned the kind of dignity and poise that makes this happen when they enter a room: \\n20.
