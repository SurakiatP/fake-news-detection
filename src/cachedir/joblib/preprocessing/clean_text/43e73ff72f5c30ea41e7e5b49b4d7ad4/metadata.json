[\u201cA May 28 airstrike on a suburban Raqqa, Syria, command post killed as up to 30 leaders and 300 troops in the militant group also identified as Daesh, ISIS, and ISIL. Reclusive leader Abu Bakr   was present \u2018and was eliminated in the strike,\u2019\u201d the ministry said, reports United Press International (UPI).  \u201cAccording to information, which we are checking through various channels, at the meeting was also present the leader of ISIS who as a result of the strike was destroyed. The American side was informed about the time and place of the Russian aviation through the channels of cooperation,\u201d the Russian ministry declared in its statement, according to ABC News. Nevertheless, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, only hours after the defense ministry\u2019s claim surfaced, said he does not have \u201c100 percent confirmation\u201d that Baghdadi has died. There have been multiple reports erroneously claiming Baghdadi has been wounded and even killed, but the Kremlin\u2019s military statement marks the first time Russia acknowledged it might have executed the war criminal. Prior to the recent allegations by the Russian military that the ISIS chief may be dead, \u201cunconfirmed news claimed that Baghdadi, whose exact whereabouts remained unknown for long, had been seriously wounded when airstrikes targeted a senior leadership meeting he chaired near the borders with Syria,\u201d noted Iraqi News. Moreover, the West and Iraq are skeptical about Moscow\u2019s claim that it has taken out Baghdadi, points out Reuters. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm these reports at this time,\u201d said Col. Ryan Dillon, the spokesman for the   U. S.  coalition, which maintains communications with Russia. \u201cWe have no information to corroborate those reports,\u201d reiterated U. S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. \u201cHis death has been reported so often that you have to be cautious till a formal Daesh [ISIS] statement comes,\u201d an unnamed European security official told Reuters. Pentagon officials say there are no indications of any \u201cchatter\u201d within the ranks of ISIS that Baghdadi has been killed or wounded, revealed Ret. Marine Col. Steve Ganyard who once served as a former deputy assistant secretary of state, according to ABC News. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to back it up, no intelligence to back it up. So we need to remain very, very suspect of this claim,\u201d added the retired Marine. The Russians claimed that they killed the ISIS chief on the outskirts of Raqqa, the jihadist group\u2019s de facto capital of Syria. Raqqa is under siege by dictator Bashar  \u2019s Syrian military, supported by Russian airpower and   Shiite militias, including the   group Hezbollah, as well as the U. S. armed forces and their allies. That makes it difficult to know for certain whether the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist has in fact fallen. \u201cRaqqa is a city under siege, so the Russians have no hard evidence. There\u2019s no DNA evidence that would suggest that he\u2019s dead,\u201d noted Col. Ganyard. However, Baghdadi this year reportedly disseminated a \u201cfarewell speech\u201d to his subordinates, followers, and sympathizers in Mosul, ISIS\u2019s last major stronghold in Iraq where U.  locals are believed to be close to victory  \u2014   pushing the terrorist group out. Echoing the commander of Iraq\u2019s Federal Police, Baghdadi admitted defeat in Mosul and revealed that   ISIS officers, apparently including him, had fled to Syria. The speech directed its combatants to \u201c\u2018disguise and escape\u2019 to the mountainous areas\u201d of Iraq and Syria, reported     News. Prior to the recent allegations by the Russian military that the ISIS chief may be dead, \u201cunconfirmed news claimed that Baghdadi, whose exact whereabouts remained unknown for long, had been seriously wounded when airstrikes targeted a senior leadership meeting he chaired near the borders with Syria,\u201d notes Iraqi News.'"}, "time": 1742563281.9530468}
