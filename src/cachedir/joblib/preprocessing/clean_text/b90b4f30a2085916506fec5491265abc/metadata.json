The NY DAILY NEWS reports: \\nPlease don\u2019t say anything about it online,\u201d Colin asked me a few days before the camp. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for the press and I don\u2019t want it to become a media event so that the kids and the families can feel like this is just for them.\u201d \\nnspired by the Black Panther Party, and their popular 10 point plan, on their 50th Anniversary, the camp created 10 rights that each child has the right to know. They were listed on the back of T-shirts given to each camper. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today to fight back and give you all lessons to combat the oppressive issues that our people face on a daily basis. We\u2019re here to give you tools to help you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you knowledge on policing history, what the systems of policing in America were based on, and we\u2019re also going to teach you skills to make sure you always make it home safely.\u201d \\nWhy couldn\u2019t Kaepernick just be normal and do something good for kids? Why so secretive? Why push such an extreme political agenda from an extremist group? \\nKaepernick could have taken another road. He has instead taken an anti-American, anti-Law Enforcement road. He has chosen the road of hate and divisiveness instead of the road of Patriotism and unity. \\nKaepernick wants to pass this line of reasoning on to children. insanity on many levels.'"}, "time": 1742561631.9562194}
