Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d? In the latest episode of \u201cThe \u201d he explains at length, switching in and out of the  \u2019s character as he describes his comedic craft. Here, he recalls his anxious, improvised debut as Mr. Trump: I spoke with Sarah Maslin Nir, my colleague who conducted (and, thankfully, recorded) the original conversation with Mr. Baldwin, his first interview about the comedic role. The liberal Mr. Baldwin concedes that he holds the   in low regard. But that has not stopped him from becoming a close student of Mr. Trump\u2019s every physical quirk and verbal tic  \u2014   he is particularly taken with Mr. Trump\u2019s tendencies to pause \u201cand then what he comes to is something that you didn\u2019t really have to pause to come up with that. \u201d But is the performance an act for the sake of comedy or an act of political rebellion? \u201cI\u2019m here doing a show,\u201d Mr. Baldwin says. \u201cI\u2019m a performer, an actor that\u2019s here doing a show. It\u2019s a great part. \u201d That said, he isn\u2019t shy about where he stands. \u201cI don\u2019t hate him. I want him to enjoy his life. I just want him to not be the president of the United States  \u2014   as quickly as possible. \u201d As a satirical version of Mr. Trump, Mr. Baldwin now deals with an unexpected dilemma, for him, anyway: Is his portrayal making the new president more human, and thus, more sympathetic? Ms. Nir asked him about that, too. That\u2019s the fake Mr. Trump. The real Mr. Trump had a busy and consequential week, grappling with   global affairs in Germany, Turkey, Russia and Syria that are challenging a presidency focused on domestic economic revival. What did we learn about his interest and influence over international events? I put that question to the White House reporters Maggie Haberman and Mark Landler.   almost always remain silent on foreign policy until their inauguration, to avoid confusing the world about who, exactly, is commander in chief. On this, Mr. Landler and Ms. Haberman agree: Mr. Trump, and his very active Twitter account, have no interest in abiding by that practice. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t subscribe to the old idea that the country has one president at a time,\u201d Mr. Landler says. Ms. Haberman questions how much we can deduce about his policy once in office from his current behavior. \u201cWhen it is not Trump triangulating against Obama and Trump actually having to be the only president, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to see in terms of foreign policy. It\u2019s a little easier for him to do this right now. \u201d From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.
