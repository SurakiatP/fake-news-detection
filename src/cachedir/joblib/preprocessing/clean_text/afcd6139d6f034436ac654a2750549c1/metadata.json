[Bolton said Trump was correct to see Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons as a threat to the United States.   \u201cI think this has been a view that has developed in the United States for a hundred years,\u201d he observed. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re just past the hundredth anniversary of America\u2019s entry into World War I. It was the use of poison gas in World War I that caused people to begin to think about what we now call weapons of mass destruction. It didn\u2019t happen overnight, but today, we include in that category nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and biological weapons. It\u2019s been a consistent, and I think correct, policy of the United States for decades to prevent the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction and to oppose their use, particularly against innocent civilians. \u201d  \u201cThis attack by the Syrians was as much an act of terrorism as it was an act of military action,\u201d he declared. As for policing the use of WMD, Bolton pointed out that \u201cnobody else is going to do it, anywhere in the world, let\u2019s not kid ourselves. \u201d  \u201cNot the United Nations, not the European Union, certainly not Russia or China, who are, by the way, themselves likely violating the Chemical Weapons Convention. We did it, and we did it because we\u2019re going to make it clear that you don\u2019t use weapons of mass destruction,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was a precise and limited rationale and a very precise strike,\u201d he judged. \u201cI think it has almost no implications for the conflict in Syria, the civil war there. \u201d  \u201cNow, I know in the past four or five days since the attack, those who advocate more U. S. involvement in the Syrian civil war have said there\u2019s a dramatic change in policy, and they\u2019re in favor of it. Many who oppose greater U. S. involvement in the Syrian civil war have said it\u2019s a dramatic change in policy, and they oppose it. They\u2019re all wrong. I don\u2019t think this is a change of policy with respect to Syria. I think it\u2019s about weapons of mass destruction,\u201d he said. SiriusXM host Alex Marlow brought up the rumors that President Trump ordered the Syria strike as an \u201cemotional response\u201d by members of the Trump family to photos and videos of chemical attack victims, especially the children. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should respond to strategic threats with an emotional response,\u201d said Bolton. \u201cI know that sounds   to some people, but I think that\u2019s the reality that the    has to face. I don\u2019t know exactly what the role of the president\u2019s family was in persuading him to do this. \u201d  \u201cI would say we would test that over the next several weeks,\u201d he proposed. \u201cFor example, many who want greater U. S. involvement on the side of the opposition, the rebels in Syria, have said, \u2018Well, what difference does it make if Assad uses chemical weapons to kill innocent men, women, and children one day and uses cluster bombs or barrel bombs the next day? The people are just as dead.\u2019 That\u2019s an argument that says once you see an atrocity  \u2014   and Secretary of State Tillerson said that we\u2019ll come to the protection of innocents all over the world. \u201d  \u201cI said before, strategic analysis can be  . It\u2019s certainly the case that the victims of these attacks are just as dead, no matter what the methods used. But I would say there is a strategic difference and a real difference for the United States whether the brutality is carried out by conventional means or by weapons of mass destruction,\u201d said Bolton.  \u201cWe are not going to stop all brutality around the world. I think it\u2019s inherent in human nature, among other reasons,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut we can say with this category of weapon  \u2014   biological, chemical, and nuclear  \u2014   they are different. They\u2019re different because of their capacity to kill in large numbers and the nature of the regimes that use them. \u201d  \u201cThis is a complex subject. I can\u2019t prove this moment that the president\u2019s going to stick to the line that he articulated or that maybe there will be an emotional response after another Syrian attack or an attack by somebody else. But I can say where we are right now on this retaliatory action against Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons, I think we\u2019re right where we should be,\u201d he contended. Marlow noted that many of Trump\u2019s voters disagree with traditional Republican foreign policy by failing to see even a heinous deployment of chemical weapons in distant lands as a direct threat to the United States. \u201cI think that the efforts we\u2019ve made over the years to prevent the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction demonstrates why we think it is a threat to the United States,\u201d Bolton countered. \u201cWe don\u2019t want more countries to have nuclear weapons. We don\u2019t want more countries to have chemical and biological weapons. \u201d \u201cSome people say there\u2019s a huge difference between chem and bio on one side and nuclear on the other. Never forget that analysts call chemical and biological weapons \u2018the poor man\u2019s atomic bomb\u2019 because it takes an awful lot less to create those kinds of weapons than the nuclear side,\u201d he pointed out.  \u201cThere have been technological reasons that it\u2019s been hard to use chemical and biological weapons because when you deliver them via artillery shell, the explosive force of the shell destroys much of the weapon  \u2014   which is why more sophisticated techniques are now being used, using ventilation systems at domed stadiums, for example, or large office buildings and that sort of thing. Put the chemical or biological weapon in the ventilation system and let it reach tens of thousands of people that way,\u201d he said.  \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the extent to which terrorists and others would love to perfect these weapons to use against us,\u201d Bolton warned. \u201cIn the caves of Afghanistan, in  \u2019s files, we found after the overthrow of the Taliban that   had been pursuing weapons of mass destruction almost from its inception. I think saying to everybody, \u2018Don\u2019t even think about using these weapons\u2019 ultimately safeguards the United States more than anybody else because of our presence all around the world. \u201d Bolton said it was difficult to have complete confidence that Trump\u2019s strike on Syria would be a \u201c \u201d action with no implications for deeper involvement but added that \u201cas of now, when you listen to the president, his rationale has been very limited and very precise. \u201d \u201cIt is true that some of his senior advisers have been much more expansive in what they\u2019re saying and have given the indication that they would like nothing more than to get further military activity underway,\u201d he acknowledged.  \u201cI thought perhaps the most disturbing thing that I heard yesterday at the press conference in Moscow between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was an observation that Lavrov made. I just want to say, for all the obvious reasons that you and your listeners can understand, I don\u2019t want to be in a public spitting contest with Rex Tillerson, but I would say this if Mother Teresa had made this comment,\u201d Bolton said.  \u201cLavrov said that Rex Tillerson told him he didn\u2019t care about history he just wanted to solve the current problems that we have. I hate to say I agree with Lavrov, but he went on to say you can\u2019t solve today\u2019s problems unless you understand the history. This temptation to say, \u2018Well, the new guys are here. We\u2019re the pros from Dover. We know how to do it. We\u2019ll take care of it\u2019 is a risk, a risk of expanded activity without a strategic rationale behind it,\u201d he cautioned.  \u201cI think what we\u2019ve got now is, we\u2019re in the right place, and I think the president should hear from his supporters the positive reinforcement that we understand the rationale for the strike against Syria, that we support it, and we think it\u2019s just fine to stop there,\u201d he said. Bolton sought to avoid hyperbole in describing the dismal state of relations between the United States and Russia. \u201cIn the midst of the politics that we found ourselves the last eight months, where after forty years of finding it difficult to stand up to the Soviet threat, the Democrats pretended to be the only defenders of America against the Manchurian candidacy run by Moscow that would convey Donald Trump into the White House, where he would do their bidding,\u201d he observed sarcastically. Bolton speculated that Trump \u201cfeels that Russian complicity, quite possibly, in this chemical weapons attack, certainly Russian efforts to cover it up after the fact through disinformation, have made it impossible for him to do what he hoped to do, which is see if he could better relations. \u201d \u201cOf course, he\u2019s frustrated by that. I think anybody would be. I\u2019m not so frustrated by it in the sense I fully expected it. Part of assuming the office is learning in a very personal sense some hard truths out there,\u201d he said. Bolton found more hard truths to be learned in North Korea, where he said there was no doubt that \u201cbecause of eight years of the Obama administration doing nothing, under the guise of a policy they called \u2018strategic patience,\u2019 which was really a synonym for doing nothing, North Korea is perilously close to having the capability to put a nuclear device under the nose cone of an ICBM and land it on the United States. \u201d \u201cThere is interesting testimony, I think it was just last week, by the commander of the U. S. Strategic Command, who said that of all the things you need to do to have a worldwide ballistic missile delivery capability for nuclear weapons that he doesn\u2019t think the North Koreans have is the miniaturization issue  \u2014   taking the nuclear device and putting it in a small enough package that it can actually be delivered via missile,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cSince we know that Russia and China both obviously mastered that a long time ago, you have to worry that the North may be even closer than we thought,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe estimates were they were close to that point, people said, within a few years. There are people at the Pentagon, serious people, who believe that it could be 2018. That\u2019s why I think there\u2019s real concern about what\u2019s going on. \u201d  \u201cI think it\u2019s coupled with the disarray in South Korea, where they\u2019ve just had their president impeached  \u2014   an election coming up next month that could return a   administration, which would be a real problem for us. So I think there\u2019s good reason to be concerned,\u201d he added.  \u201cYou ask what the   solution is. I believe this: North Korea will never be talked out of its nuclear weapons  \u2014   not by diplomacy, not be economic pressure. People in North Korea live a prison camp now. The regime doesn\u2019t care about their economic  . They care about staying in power. A nuclear weapon is the regime\u2019s ace in the hole to stay in power,\u201d he contended. \u201cI think the only   way to deal with the North Korean nuclear weapons program is to end the regime in North Korea,\u201d Bolton advised. \u201cReunite the Korean peninsula. It\u2019s not enough to pressure China to impose sanctions on North Korea. They need to understand that this regime poses a threat to stability in the region that undermines their security as well. We need to bring them to the realization that reunification is going to happen one way or the other. We can either do it the sensible way, or it will happen in a much more threatening way. I don\u2019t pretend that\u2019s easy, but that\u2019s the real solution. \u201d He said if reunification occurs, the \u201c \u201d necessary to repair   North Korea would be done by the Korean people themselves. \u201cTo return to the German analogy, the country in the North Atlantic region that wanted German reunification most was the United States,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe other European powers feared it, the West Germans thought it would cost too much, but ultimately, it was the United States that prevailed. I think the same thing is true here. \u201d  \u201cThe South Koreans are worried about their pensions. In fact, the reunification of the two Koreas would produce an economic boom for South Korea,\u201d he argued. \u201cA huge labor force in the North that would become available to their capital investments  \u2014   boy, I tell you, the Korean peninsula would just take off after reunification. \u201d \u201cWhat China needs to be convinced of is that they wouldn\u2019t see American troops on the Yalu River, the border with China, after reunification,\u201d Bolton stressed. \u201cThey saw that movie in 1950. They didn\u2019t like [it] then. They don\u2019t like it now. Fortunately, we don\u2019t want to be on the Yalu River either. We want to be at the southern tip of the peninsula so we can deploy elsewhere in East Asia if there\u2019s a crisis. There\u2019s a deal there. \u201d  \u201cAs I say, it\u2019s not easy. I don\u2019t underestimate it. But there\u2019s a way to do this if we start now and persist on it,\u201d he said.  \u201cI would be very wary of Chinese assurances that they\u2019re going to help persuade North Korea to give up the nuclear weapons program,\u201d Bolton cautioned. \u201cThey\u2019ve said that for 25 years, and they haven\u2019t done a single thing to materially impede North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. I think further discussions with North Korea, further efforts to pressure North Korea, are basically a waste of time. The way to end the North\u2019s nuclear program is to end the North  \u2014   merge it, reunify it with South Korea. \u201d John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and head of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.
