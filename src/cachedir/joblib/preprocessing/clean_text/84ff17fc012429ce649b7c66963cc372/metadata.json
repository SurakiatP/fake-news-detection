(Photo by AFP) \\nUS Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence says the mainstream media is biased against Donald Trump, and there are \u201cmany instances\u201d of voter fraud in the run up to the November 8 election. \\nRepublican presidential nominee Trump has recently intensified his criticism of the American electoral system. He calls the election process rigged, and says the media is colluding with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in order to win the White House. \\nHe has questioned the legitimacy of the US elections, saying that he believed the vote was already being \"rigged\" at many polling places. \\nDuring his final presidential debate with Clinton last week, Trump declared that he might not accept the results of the November 8 presidential election if there is evidence it was rigged. \\nIn an interview with CBS News on Friday, Trump\u2019s running mate, Pence, said, \u201cMake no mistake about it, there are many instances in our lifetimes of voter fraud in individual polling places and in certain jurisdictions.\u201d \\n\u201cDonald Trump and I are just calling on people to respectfully participate in the electoral process. We want a victory on Election Day, but we also want it to be a victory for American democracy,\u201d he stated. Donald Trump speaks at an event on October 15, 2016 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

The people that rallying around our team, rallying around our cause, love this country, are passionate about this country and are anxious to see change,\u201d the GOP vice presidential nominee stated. \\nHe went on to accuse the media of unfairly backing Clinton. \\n\u201cThe level of negative coverage about my running mate in many quarters in the national media has just been overwhelming compared to any negative coverage or frankly the avalanche of scandals coming out of Hillary Clinton\u2019s years as secretary of State,\u201d Pence said.
