[\u201cEveryone who\u2019s been briefed on this subject, from Republican to Democrat to CIA  \u2014   former Obama administration\u2019s [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper, [CIA Director John] Brennan, you name it  \u2014   all of the people come back with the same conclusion  \u2026    that there\u2019s been no evidence,\u201d he said at the White House press briefing.  Spicer said if anyone was trying to engage with Russia, it was Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt was Hillary Clinton, who was the architect of the last administration\u2019s failed reset policy  \u2014   she told Russian state TV that it was designed to strengthen Russia. That was their goal: to strengthen Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cShe used her office to make concession after concession, selling off   of our country\u2019s uranium, paid speeches, paid deals, getting personal calls from Vladimir Putin. I think if there\u2019s  \u2014   really want to talk about a Russian connection and the substance, that\u2019s where we should be looking,\u201d he added. Spicer was referring to how in 2010,   of State Clinton was one of nine to sign off on Russia\u2019s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada. Around the same time, a Russian investment bank paid Bill Clinton $500, 000 to give a speech. \u201cWhen you talk about connections to Russia, the only connection that anyone\u2019s made with President Trump is multiple years ago he hosted a pageant there and he\u2019s  \u2014   some of the  \u2014   you know, he owns condos around the world and some of them were sold to some Russians and I think he sold a house to one several years back. That\u2019s his connection,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when you compare the two sides in terms of who\u2019s actually engaging with Russia, trying to strengthen them, trying to act with them, trying to interact with them, it is night and day between our actions and her actions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet no one questioned what she was doing or how she was handling it. \u201d Critics of President Trump have argued that his campaign aides colluded with Russia to help him get elected. While intelligence officials have assessed that Russia tried to interfere in the U. S. elections in favor of Trump by hacking into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton aide John Podesta and leaking embarrassing emails, there has been no evidence that Russia affected the outcome of the election or that there was collusion with Trump campaign officials. The FBI is investigating the matter, and the House and Senate intelligence committees are also investigating it. But Clapper told NBC News on March 5 that no evidence existed that showed any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. \u201cNot to my knowledge,\u201d he said, when asked if any evidence existed. Clapper said there could have been information found since he left the government on January 20, but as of then, \u201cWe had no evidence of such collusion. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564320.0366735}
