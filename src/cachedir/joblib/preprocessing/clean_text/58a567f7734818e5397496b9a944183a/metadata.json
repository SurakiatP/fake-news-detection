[In response to recent statements by Italian Archbishop Luigi Negri that suggested Benedict had resigned under significant duress, Father Federico Lombardi (pictured) said Thursday that the Pope Emeritus must be taken at his word when he said he had stepped down \u201cin full freedom and responsibility. \u201d  \u201cThere is no mystery to be revealed,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cBenedict XVI is a man who put the truth first. How can someone so blatantly contradict what he said and then solemnly reaffirmed?\u201d In statements earlier this week, Archbishop Negri claimed that the Obama administration may have been complicit in the \u201ctremendous pressures\u201d that led the former pope to resign in 2013. It is \u201cno coincidence\u201d that some Catholic groups \u201chave asked President Trump to open a commission of inquiry to investigate whether the administration of Barack Obama exerted pressure on Benedict,\u201d Negri said in an interview Monday, citing revelations by Wikileaks regarding efforts by the Democratic Party to influence the Catholic Church in the United States. Father Lombardi, who was papal spokesman during the Benedict years, noted that the former pontiff offered a substantially different account of his resignation from the one offered by Negri, and he did so \u201cpublicly before the cardinals gathered in Consistory and the world\u201d and again in an interview book with Peter Seewald titled Last Testament. According to Father Lombardi, Negri\u2019s comments have provoked questions and \u201cunnecessary confusion. \u201d Negri, who claims to be Benedict\u2019s \u201cfriend,\u201d offers an odd demonstration of friendship in \u201ctriumphantly\u201d contradicting what his friend has said, Lombardi observes. \u201cI do not think it is necessary to think of terrible pressures from overseas,\u201d Lombardi states. \u201cWe can easily think that his was a very wise and sensible decision, before God and before men. \u201d \u201cI believe that several of his successors will be grateful,\u201d he said.
