Only nine days ago, James Comey, then director of the FBI, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on FBI oversight that he had never been an anonymous source for news reports related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. [Comey further testified that he never authorized anyone else at the FBI to serve as an anonymous source in news media coverage of that investigation or the agency\u2019s probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server.  Fast forward to yesterday. The New York Times published intimate details allegedly from inside a    dinner at the White House between Comey and Trump that took place seven days after the president was sworn in. The article quoted liberally from \u201ctwo people who have heard [Comey\u2019s] account of the dinner\u201d in what seems to be a leak from Comey\u2019s camp to fight back after Trump fired Comey earlier this week.  At one point in the article, the Times describes the sources as \u201cassociates\u201d of Comey\u2019s. The White House disputed the Times\u2019 dinner account, which claims that Trump asked Comey to pledge loyalty to him. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this to be an accurate account,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, told the Times. \u201cThe integrity of our law enforcement agencies and their leadership is of the utmost importance to President Trump. He would never even suggest the expectation of personal loyalty, only loyalty to our country and its great people. \u201d Trump also tweeted the following warning about Comey leaking to the news media. James Comey better hope that there are no \u201dtapes\u201d of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017,  The alleged leaks follow Comey\u2019s May 3 testimony in which he steadfastly denied aiding in leaks to the news media regarding the FBI\u2019s investigations into alleged Russian interference or the Clinton email probe. The denials came during the following exchange with Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley ( ): GRASSLEY: And thank you for your opening statement. I\u2019m going to start out probably with a couple subjects you wish I didn\u2019t bring up, and then a third one that I think everybody needs to hear your opinion on on a policy issue. It is frustrating when the FBI refuses to answer this committee\u2019s questions, but leaks relevant information to the media. In other words, they don\u2019t talk to us, but somebody talks to the media. Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation? COMEY: Never. GRASSLEY: Question two, relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?
