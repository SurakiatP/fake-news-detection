This was Helena Ayeh. She said doctors told her that she was the last bomb victim there to be released. Just after 4 a. m. she told the story of what happened to her. On Saturday night, she was walking through the metal gate outside her apartment building on the south side of West 23rd Street, where she has lived for 11 years. She carried a bag with some bottles of wine inside. Without warning, an explosion lifted her off her feet. The blast, which injured 29 people, appeared to be an intentional act, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said, though the authorities did not believe it was linked to international terrorism. \u201cIt was the biggest blast I ever would imagine lights flashing, glass shattering,\u201d Ms. Ayeh recalled. \u201cIt happened so fast I was thrown up and landed down. I didn\u2019t know where it had come from. \u201d She could not guess how high or how far she was thrown. But the concrete she landed on was littered with shards of glass, including from her shattered wine bottles. She reached a hand to her face. \u201cI realized there was blood streaming down my face, and I couldn\u2019t see out of my eye,\u201d Ms. Ayeh said. \u201cI said, \u2018Help! Help!\u2019 when I saw the blood. \u201d Around her, the   air was filled with the shrieks of bystanders and the sirens of emergency vehicles. Someone shouted to her that an ambulance was near the end of the block. With blood pouring from the wound to her right eye, she struggled on injured legs toward it until emergency medical workers met her. \u201cThe ambulance, they literally picked me up off the ground,\u201d Ms. Ayeh said. At Bellevue, she received multiple stitches to a cut at the edge of her right eye. Beneath her   glasses, it was red and swollen. Her injured legs were also treated. \u201cThey patched me up,\u201d she said, a weary smile on her face. Ms. Ayeh later said in a   interview: \u201cI consider myself very, very lucky I\u2019m not blind. I\u2019m very blessed, I think. \u201d Just before a taxi stopped and took her away on Sunday morning, she reflected on the Dumpster under which officials said the bomb had been placed. She knew it well. \u201cIt\u2019s been there forever,\u201d she said. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think about it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561758.074897}
