[Carfentanil, a tranquilizer designed to put down   elephants, is 10, 000 times more potent than morphine and is 100 times more potent than fentanyl. A dose of carfentanil the size of a grain of sand is considered a lethal dose for a human being.  \u201cIt\u2019s so dangerous that while our people are gathering evidence they have to be in full suits that you would see for the clandestine team,\u201d said Public Relations Officer Stephen Limani. State police indicated that the 5 grams of carfentanil seized are enough to make 50, 000 stamp bags of heroin. At $20 per stamp bag, Limani said that 5 grams of carfentanil are enough to create $1 million of the product. \u201cI would be shocked if this delivery did not end up killing a large quantity of people in our area,\u201d Trooper Limani told reporters. In addition to the carfentanil, police also discovered a grow operation of 136 marijuana plants. Police confirmed that child and youth services are also involved in the case because a child was among those living in the home.
