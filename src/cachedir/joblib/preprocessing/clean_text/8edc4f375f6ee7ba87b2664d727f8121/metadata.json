Mike Flynn. [Obviously strongly prefer normal democratic and constitutional politics. But if it comes to it, prefer the deep state to the Trump state.  \u2014   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) February 14, 2017,   The \u201cdeep state\u201d is jargon for the   army of bureaucrats, officials, retired officials, legislators, contractors and media people who support and defend established government policies. Those \u201cdeep state\u201d officials include the intelligence,   and national security officials who worked in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration but who are still working in permanent or temporary positions in the White House and in surrounding agencies. Many of those officials are believed to be leaking information from within the White House to allies in the   media, including Kristol. Coming after Flynn\u2019s departure, Kristol\u2019s Tweet indicates his support for the    \u2014   and potentially illegal  \u2014   actions by government officials who helped push out Flynn by taping and leaking his private calls with the Russian ambassador. Flynn\u2019s resignation seems a bit like Watergate. Democrats, media  the IC went after Nixon, and in some ways unfairly. Still, he was guilty.  \u2014   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) February 14, 2017,  Throughout the 2016 election, Kristol strongly opposed Trump.'"}, "time": 1742628556.4317899}
