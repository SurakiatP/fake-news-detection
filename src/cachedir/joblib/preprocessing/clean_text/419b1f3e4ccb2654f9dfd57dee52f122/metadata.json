CAIR-MN says that \u201cIslamophobic\u201d vandals spray-painted \u201cISIS\u201d on the Muslim Student Association\u2019s sign on campus. However, if you are familiar with the background of the MSA, it\u2019s easy to understand why ISIS is an appropriate tag for them. MSA, like CAIR, is a North American affiliate of the terror-linked Muslim Brotherhood organization (original founders of al-Qaeda), whose headquarters, originally in Egypt (from which it has been banned by the al-Sisi government for its terrorist activities) now is in Qatar, a well-known state sponsor of terrorism, including the Islamic State (ISIS). FOX9 Naturally, the CAIR thugs think you are too ignorant to know this, so they perform their usual \u201cIslamophobia\u201d tap dance, demanding yet another time-wasting state and local hate crime investigation for some harmless graffiti which was likely painted by Muslim students themselves. \u201cUniversity administrators and state religious and political leaders must speak out forcefully against the rising anti-Muslim hate in our society that results in such disturbing incidents,\u201d said a statement from CAIR-MN executive director Jaylani Hussein. \u201cWe urge campus police and other relevant law enforcement agencies to investigate this incident as a hate crime.\u201d Hussein cited the \u201cIslamophobic rhetoric in the presidential election campaign,\u201d particularly from Donald Trump, as a possible contributing factor to these types of incidents. (No, it\u2019s the abhorrent behavior of Muslims themselves that cause so many people around the world to hate Muslims)'"}, "time": 1742628520.4389374}
