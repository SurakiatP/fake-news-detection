The 2014 rock album\u2019s sales also spiked, hitting the number seven spot on the iTunes top albums list, Fox News reports. According to the screenshot she shared, the singer\u2019s album was beating albums by more   artists like Big Sean and Lady Gaga, the latter of whom performed during Sunday night\u2019s ceremony. As of 9 a. m. Pacific Time on Monday, Villa\u2019s album was at the #11 spot on the iTunes charts, while Lady Gaga\u2019s The Fame was at #33 and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Album of the   Lemonade was at #90.

From calls for her death to degrading insults, the   \u201ctolerant\u201d left smeared Villa for daring to express a political view not in accordance with their own. Last year, teenage classical singer Jackie Evancho saw sales of her albums skyrocket following news that she was to perform the National Anthem at Trump\u2019s inauguration.
