[The letter, which was the second message sent from attorney Harmeet K. Dhillon to university administrators, is in response to communication with Berkeley\u2019s Chief Campus Counsel and Associate General Counsel Christopher Patti and claims that the Berkeley College Republicans will pursue legal action if the university fails to protect Coulter\u2019s First Amendment right to speak on campus.  \u201cUC Berkeley only began raising more and more issues about the event, and piling on new and more arbitrary restrictions, as the date drew closer,\u201d Dhillon wrote. \u201cDespite six weeks of notice that a famous author would be coming to Berkeley to speak, and that the students sponsoring her wanted to know about security arrangements and venues where they could accommodate ticketed guests, and more than a full four weeks after learning of a confirmed date, desired time, and two desired venues for the event, your administration played a shell game with the two student groups. \u201d Dhillon expressed concern that the administration decided to place new restrictions on the event just two weeks before it was set to take place. \u201cAfter offering and discussing all of the above potential venues with the student groups for some time, UC Berkeley administrators then suddenly announced a new barrier to the venue confirmation by informing the students on April 13  \u2014   now a mere two weeks before the event the University had notice of for four weeks already  \u2014   that there was a new, unpublished University policy, developed in a meeting on March 1, 2017, without student organization input,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThank you for conceding in your letter today that UC Berkeley chooses to limit speech as a direct result of the successful misconduct of \u2018some of the same groups that previously engaged in local violent action,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cIn other words, all one has to do to silence conservative speakers at UC Berkeley, is to don a mask and become violent, or place anonymous phone calls to the administration threatening such violence. \u201d \u201cUnfortunately for UC Berkeley\u2019s sui generis policies for stifling conservative speech, the Constitution does not permit the heckler\u2019s veto to drown out the voices of speakers in otherwise permitted places,\u201d Dhillon declared. Dhillon argued that Berkeley administrators used Orwellian   when they suggested that, in the name of protecting Coulter\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech, would have to look to an alternative date in which security could best prepare to handle possible violence. \u201cYour letter suggests that that the University wants to \u2018work with the [BCR] to find an alternative date when the event could be held as safely as possible.\u2019 This is Orwellian \u201d she wrote. \u201cThanks to the prior success of the   criminals at silencing conservative speech at UC Berkeley, they appear to be here to stay, so it is disingenuous at best to suggest that there is some date in the future and some place on the campus where conservative invitees may speak free of protest, interference  \u2014   or arbitrary administration censorship in the guise of rules. \u201d \u201cRecognizing that we now live in a place and time where people such as BCR\u2019s invited speakers will face local protest, UC Berkeley is still obligated under the law to make its facilities available to student groups in a   and   manner, and no amount of \u201c \u201d rules for certain speakers, relieves the University of this obligation,\u201d Dhillon argued. \u201cShould the University choose to reconsider its decision to bar Ms. Coulter from speaking in a similar time, place, venue, and level of accessibility to students able to hear her speak, as it affords speakers with favored voices, we will be pleased to suspend our lawsuit preparation and work with you to finalize the venue and time of her speech on April 27 as planned, and for which there are available venues,\u201d Dhillon concluded. \u201cIf we do not hear from you, we expect to file suit shortly and seek interim relief soon thereafter. \u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
