[\u201cYiannopoulos does not deserve to be granted the platform of a university campus to espouse his hateful beliefs,\u201d wrote the student newspaper on Sunday. \u201cInstitutions of higher education pride themselves on generating new knowledge and challenging old beliefs for the purposes of advancing our understanding of the world. Furthermore, these institutions are built on the principle of   research. \u201d  \u201cIn contrast, Yiannopoulos appears to challenge others\u2019 beliefs simply for the sake of being a contrarian, and he does so with little tenability for his claims,\u201d they continued. \u201cYiannopoulos is little more than a racist, sexist, and   who encourages hate and fear rather than intellectual thought. \u201d The student newspaper also claimed \u201cYiannopoulos poses a tangible threat to the safety and   of university students,\u201d before adding that \u201cThis alone should be more than enough for administrators to bar him from campuses in the first place. \u201d You can read the full article at The Harvard Crimson.'"}, "time": 1742564308.4121134}
