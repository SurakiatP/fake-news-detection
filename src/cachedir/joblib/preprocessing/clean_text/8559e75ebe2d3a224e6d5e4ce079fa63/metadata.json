[Juniperangelica Xiomara   a   transgender transfer student at UC Berkeley, argues in an   for the Daily Californian this week that she will \u201cnot put down [her] lighter fuel\u201d as long as speakers like Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter are permitted to speak on campus.  \u201cThe concepts that America is great because of our ability to share perspectives and differing opinions, that UC Berkeley is beautiful because we can discuss and organize with opposite sides of the political spectrum   \u2026     are bullshit,\u201d   argues, claiming instead that free speech sustains institutional structures of oppression. \u201cThis has done nothing more than maintain the white supremacist, capitalistic and patriarchal nature that allowed colonizers to protect their power centuries ago and that has allowed their descendants to elect an openly racist, queerphobic,   and   administration. \u201d View post on imgur. com,  \u201cFree speech has always been a tactic used by the state to grant the illusion that all voices in this nation are valued, yet there is a reason why Black female senators are discredited and why there is a white supremacist in the Oval Office,\u201d   argues. The column argues that free speech directly conflicts with the aims of those who seek to protect the freedoms of marginalized students, students that   believes Yiannopoulos and Coulter want dead. \u201cI\u2019m not here for free speech. I\u2019m here for Black lives. I\u2019m here for undocumented lives, queer and trans lives, femme lives, incarcerated lives and poor lives. I am here for the lives Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter want dead. I am here for the lives Donald Trump wants to ban. I am here for the lives BCR cannot fit in their \u201csocially moderate, fiscally conservative\u201d fantasy,\u201d   argues.   claims that free speech principles must be dismantled if marginalized individuals are to \u201cconfront [their] oppressors. \u201d \u201d \u201cAre we committed to our peer\u2019s survival, or are we keeping our heads down and continuing the pursuit of a degree? Are we willing to confront our oppressors head on, or do we want to play respectability politics and support university actions that disregard communities?\u201d Comments on the article were overwhelmingly negative, with most expressing concern over  \u2019s unwillingness to \u201cput down [her] lighter fuel,\u201d which many considered to be a direct endorsement of violence in response to political speech. \u201cWords are words and violence are violence, and the two are not the same. In fact, the freedom to say as we think is a vital component to preventing violence, for if someone is not allowed to support their cause through speech, violence is the only option left to them,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cYou endorse the suppression of dissenting opinions through violence. Lets (sic) not sugar coat your views with doublespeak about \u201cprotecting\u201d minorities. The only things you protect are your own snowflake feelings,\u201d another added.
