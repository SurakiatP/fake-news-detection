We hid. We saw many shells landing meters away from us, \u201d Gazdiev said. \\nThe Syrian Army helped the RT crew along with civilians being evacuated from the area. \\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Russian military said that last week\u2019s attempts by the militants to break through the blockade around the city had failed, and suggested that they leave Aleppo through one of two corridors opened for that purpose. \\nRussia and Syria halted airstrikes on eastern Aleppo two weeks ago amid a flurry of criticism from the West over civilian casualties in the city. Moscow said civilians were being held by the militants as human shields, but agreed to keep warplanes away from the city. \\nThe offer to leave Aleppo by Friday night was rejected by some groups controlling the eastern part of the city. \\nRussia\u2019s earlier attempts to allow militants to leave and civilians to be evacuated from eastern Aleppo were thwarted by the more belligerent groups, which opened fire at anyone trying to use the corridors \u2013 both those meant for armed people and unarmed civilians.'"}, "time": 1742562013.0013883}
