RT\u2019s crew on the ground reports that dozens of people remain at the camp. \\n\u201cSoon after that statement was made we went inside and saw that there was either a massive blunder in terms of their public relations line or a lie. The camp was far from being evacuated and closed,\u201d RT\u2019s Harry Fear reported from the scene. \\nOn Thursday, Buccio warned that refugees arriving at the \u2018Jungle\u2019 camp in the future would not be offered resettlement, unlike those evacuated in recent days. \\n\u201cIt is not Calais\u2019 role to receive all the migrants of Europe. We do not want to create a vacuum. We have asked [those newly arrived] migrants to disperse,\u201d she said. \\nEarlier in the day, about 100 migrants were seen filing past police officers overseeing the camp demolition, Reuters reports.   6:43  \""}, "time": 1742562252.6543558}
