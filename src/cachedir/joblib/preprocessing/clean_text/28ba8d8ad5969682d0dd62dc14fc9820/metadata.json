Basically people like these scholars have ignored the problem. Walker said when men realize they are in danger of contracting AIDS from women who have been victims of FGM, then they will condemn the practice. \u201c[A] lot of it has to be about making sure that men, and maybe starting really young, really understand that they are endangering themselves,\u201d Walker explained, adding: Because they really are very   people, most men  \u2014   and I say that because when I started talking about female genital mutilation and writing about it  \u2014   many men in Africa and elsewhere just completely denied it, and just didn\u2019t want to hear about it. Until I said, \u2018Well, you know, you notice how AIDS is spreading, and one of the ways that it spreads is through these fissures and tears that happen when you have intercourse with someone who has been mutilated,\u201d  \u2014   and that really sat them up very straight. Walker, an advisory board member of Feminist. com, along with Gloria Steinem and Jane Fonda, said that while she and other feminists are \u201ctired\u201d of educating men, it still seems to be \u201creally important. \u201d \u201cEspecially if we\u2019re thinking of our sisters\u2019 and daughters\u2019 health,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd not only that, so many of us by now have these wonderful feminist sons and grandsons, who really are allies, and we should give them the respect as allies, in changing a lot of the things that are wrong and done against women in the world. \u201d Walker\u2019s horror regarding FGM and its association with Islam is at odds with fellow feminist Germaine Greer, who appeared as a guest with Australia\u2019s Tony Jones of ABC. net\u2019s QA. Greer said Islam is not the problem when it comes to FGM. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the sort of caricature of Islam that we keep promulgating,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it  \u2026     All of this is weird. I mean, one of the commonest operations in the United States is reduction of the labia minora. And it costs you $8, 000 or something, and it\u2019s carried out massively. Huge, thousands, hundreds of thousands of cases a year. \u201d The QA discussion continued: Tony Jones:But do you class that as genital mutilation? Germaine Greet:Well, I class circumcision as genital mutilation. Sorry, guys. If you\u2019re going to really deal with this question of genital mutilation, start paying attention. Find out what happens to human genitalia. It\u2019s not pretty and you mightn\u2019t like it, but you\u2019re going to be in a pretty silly situation if you start, you know, doing the  \u2014   what did we used to call it?  \u2014   the   test, at the passport control. \u201cLet me see if you\u2019ve been mutilated. \u201d And why does that particular mutilation have this kudos? Why is it such an important thing? Why does God like it? I don\u2019t think God likes it at all. I think God should take issue. During an interview at the end of 2015 with Tami Simon on podcast Insights at the Edge, Walker said she was shocked to hear people criticize her for exposing the problem of FGM. She continued: Now, there is a place that you would think is so obvious. I mean, would you yourself hold down a little baby girl and proceed to cut away all of her genitals? It should be a   \u2014  just an anathema. People should look at you \u2014  and some of them did \u2014  and say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just not possible. \u201d Well, it is possible. It\u2019s happening right this minute. I wrote this novel, Possessing the Secret of Joy, made a film about the practice \u2014  first went all over places where FGM is practiced [and] made a film \u2014  lugged the film around Africa, wherever we could find a projector, and [then] London, New York, San Francisco. Everywhere we went \u2014  [filmmaker] Pratibha Parmar and I \u2014  and still, after ten years, to have people say things like, \u201cOh, this is the colonial gaze. She\u2019s just trying to get back in the limelight. \u201d Really. As you can tell, I am still on some level speechless. Walker said the practice of FGM has been traveling from Africa and now to London. With the increase in immigration from countries that perform FGM, more girls in the United States are undergoing the cutting as well. A recent study suggests the imported practice of FGM can actually segregate hundreds of thousands of American girls of immigrant parents from their peers in mainstream American society. \u201cThat\u2019s why that book is written the way it is written \u2014  so that you can see that these atrocities that people do to each other don\u2019t stay in the tribe that they practiced in \u2014  whatever the tribe is, whether it\u2019s the gay tribe or whatever,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThings don\u2019t stay put. They travel. That is why people need to pay attention by what has done to harm other people \u2014  because if you\u2019re a person, eventually it\u2019s going to fly right back in some form at you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628575.7362034}
