It destroys freedom of association, subjects our private relationships to bureaucratic judgment and meddling, and substitutes the totalitarian credo of \u201ccivil rights\u201d for the freedom from government Americans previously espoused. \\nNo wonder the left loves it. This legislation is Progressives\u2019 Bible and Psalter in one convenient package, the inspiration for much of their mischief. \\nSo I was staggered to read that the radical left\u2014not your average Marxist on Medicaid but the sexual deviants, feminists, \u201csocial activists\u201d and \u201cadvocates,\u201d Congressional Dimocrats, and other misfits with too much time on their hands\u2014has excoriated the Civil Rights Act. Damned it, in fact. \\nWhat inspired this astounding about-face? The \u201cRussell Amendment\u201d to the NDAA. \\nThe National Defense Authorization Act is as monstrous as the civil-rights one, which doubtless explains its gliding through Congress the last 54 years. This baby annually finances \u201cour\u201d troops\u2014you know, the gullible, unemployed and unemployable, barely literate cannon fodder the government\u2019s schools spew that the government\u2019s \u201carmed forces\u201d then prey on\u2014sorry, \u201crecruit.\u201d I haven\u2019t surveyed all 54 Congresses that have overwhelmingly passed the NDAA, but I bet few criminals there ever dare vote \u201cNay\u201d lest the parents, friends and neighbors of said cannon-fodder accuse them of not \u201csupporting\u201d \u201cour\u201d hired killers. \\nSince politicians consider the NDAA a \u201cmust-pass\u201d bit of chicanery, they are fond of attaching amendments to it, just as drivers stuck in traffic fall in line behind an ambulance with screaming sirens. Often, said amendments merely pertain to the usual corruption, i.e., pork . But lately they\u2019ve also codified terror. For example, the NDAA of 2012 legalized the \u201cindefinite mlitary detention\u201d of American citizens . And yes, 2016\u2019s NDAA still includes that Stalinesque decree. \\nThis year, Rep. Steve Russell [R-OK] sponsored an amendment that\u2019s benign, relatively speaking. To wit, \u201c Any branch or agency of the Federal Government shall , with respect to any religious corporation, religious association, religious educational institution, or religious society that is a recipient of or offeror [ sic ; don\u2019t you love it when existing jargon doesn\u2019t adequately cover politicians\u2019 sins, so they invent more?] for a Federal Government contract, subcontract, grant, purchase order, or cooperative agreement, provide protections and exemptions consistent with sections 702(a) and 703(e)(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-1(a) and 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(e)(2)) and section 103(d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 USC 12113(d)).\u201d \\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but isn\u2019t Ol\u2019 Steve simply upholding the Civil Rights Act and its wretched daughter, the ADA? \\nWhich infuriates the aforementioned crackpots and deviants. \u201c If passed, the Russell Amendment could put the livelihood of millions of Americans at risk, according to Sejal Singh, of the Center for American Progress.\u201d \\nHuh? But\u2014but, Sejal, the Civil Rights Act forced employers to hire millions of Americans, even if they lacked skills and qualifications\u2014 \\n\u201c\u2018 This would jeopardize protections for over 28 million people \u2014 or one in five employees \u2014 who are under federal contract,\u2019 Singh [said]\u2026 She believes the amendment was introduced as a way to counteract President Obama\u2019s executive orders prohibiting workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender expression.\u201d \\nWha\u2014? But\u2014but Sejal, the Civil Rights Act, you can\u2019t be serious \u2014 \\n\u201c \u2019We believe that this is part of a wave of backlash against progress in LGBT and women\u2019s rights,\u2019 Singh added.\u201d \\nYep, this nutjob actually insists that the Civil Rights Act inhibits rather than promotes \u201cprogress in LGBT and women\u2019s rights.\u201d As if we would even talk with, let alone take orders, from her and her fellow deviants without the Act\u2019s aiming federal guns at us. \\nNor is Sejal alone in her hysteria: whole battalions of Marxists have joined her in bewailing the Civil Rights Act. There\u2019s \u201c David Stacy, the government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign ,\u201d who \u201cpointed out the explicit danger this amendment could pose for LGBTQ employees.\u201d And good that he did, because anyone normal certainly won\u2019t see it: \u201c\u2019This amendment would give legal grounds for an employer to prevent a gay man from having their [ sic ] husband [ sic ] added to their [ sic ] health insurance. Trans people could be fired from their job [ sic ] upon announcing their intent to transition,\u2019 Stacy explained.\u201d \\nEither Dave didn\u2019t read Russell\u2019s amendment or he\u2019s as deranged as he is effeminate and ungrammatical. (And let us here lament the degeneration of the language these degenerates favor, the nonsense and irrationality. Men do not have \u201chusbands\u201d; singular nouns require singular pronouns; and unless all \u201ctrans people\u201d malinger in a single job, they would be fired from their job s, plural. What absurd gyrations, and all to avoid those helpful terms, \u201chis\u201d and \u201chers\u201d!) \\nBut for manic hyperbole, it\u2019s hard to beat the ACLU, tireless cheerleader for tyranny in general and civil rights in particular: \u201c \u2019The Russell Amendment is one of the most significant threats to LGBT people and women we have seen in Congress in years. It must be removed from the defense bill \u2014 freedom, equality and fairness are at stake,\u2019 said ACLU deputy legal director Louise Melling.\u201d Good gracious, who ever suspected the Civil Rights Act of such wickedness? \\nNaturally, \u201c Senate Democrats and the White House are \u2026 signaling strong opposition to a provision they say would allow for discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201d I shan\u2019t ask whether these dimwits are insane: we all know they are. Still, do any of them realize the amendment reinforces their hallowed Civil Rights Act? Have any of them read Russell\u2019s wording? \\nNo surprise if they haven\u2019t. First, Congressional goldbrickers vote on legislation without even glancing at the text . Second, Russell\u2019s amendment is suspiciously absent from all the reports but one that I\u2019ve seen on this silliness. Could it be that the agitators know the amendment\u2019s innocuous, and their cronies in the corporate media have agreed not to reprint it? And third, this confirms that Progressives can\u2019t think for themselves (or at all, truth be told). If they could, surely someone would protest, \u201cHey, what are we doing , trashing the Civil Rights Act?\u201d \\nAt any rate, the Dimocrats have vented their dudgeon \u201cin a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.\u201d The whole screed is risible, but my nominee for \u201cMost Absurd Claim\u201d is this line: \u201c This discrimination erodes the freedoms that our military has fought for generations to protect. \u201d \\nWhat the Dimocrats actually mean by \u201cdiscrimination\u201d is \u201cfailing to roll over and play dead for all varieties of pervert in all situations at all times.\u201d And \u201cour military\u201d most certainly has not \u201cfought for generations\u201d for such \u201cfreedoms.\u201d If you\u2019d told the guys starving at Valley Forge that they were dying so Daniel and Stephan can sodomize one another, they\u2019d have deserted to the Redcoats. Indeed, I\u2019m reminded of John Adams\u2019 cry: \u201cPosterity! You will never know how much it cost the present Generation to preserve your Freedom! I hope you will make good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in Heaven, that I ever took half the Pains to preserve it.\u201d I doubt John would define men sashaying into the women\u2019s loo as \u201cmaking good use of your Freedom.\u201d \\nMeanwhile, recall what fomented this outsized fury against the Civil Rights Act: the fear that a Christian might contract with the Feds to supply overpriced toilet seats and\u2014horrors!\u2014refuse to hire Bruce/Caitlyn as s/he convalesces from castration. For that , the LGPMNOQZ-whatever\u2014in short, the Debauched Community throws the Civil Rights Act under the bus. \\nIf the DC\u2014hmmm. What a happy coincidence that this abbreviation once again connotes a dictatorial sewer!\u2014if the DC succeeds in stripping this amendment from the NDAA, so what? Christians ought never deal with the satanic State in any way, except to undermine and overthrow it while comforting its victims. Let\u2019s hope believers so dead to conscience that they connive with Uncle Sam\u2019s evil reconsider when they hear that the DC will once again force them to hire deviants. \\n\u201c Religious freedom is essential to America ,\u201d opines one of the DC, \u201cbut it is not a right to discriminate, and not with taxpayer dollars. You should never be disqualified for a job because you think or believe differently from your employer.\u201d Get it? \u201cReligious freedom\u201d is all right in its place, but Caesar\u2019s deviant demands are far more legitimate than any serf\u2019s convictions. \\nIn their letter, the Dimocrats allege that Russell\u2019s emphasis on the Civil Rights Act will \u201c harm hardworking Americans who deserve to be protected from workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, religious identity, or reproductive and other health care decisions.\u201d Hey, if that\u2019s the case, repeal the Civil Rights Act, and quick!
