Not since President Bill Clinton shut down two runways in 1993 for a $200 trim aboard Air Force One have the tresses of a head of state been so widely discussed. But as men\u2019s upkeep has gone the way of female grooming  \u2014   Botox, facials and waxing, you know, down there  \u2014   so, too, has the high price of a haircut. Ask Tim Rogers, a stylist at Sally Hershberger\u2019s downtown New York studio, who charges a minimum of $400, and as much as $800, for a men\u2019s haircut these days. He regularly flies to the Hamptons by helicopter to attend to a coterie of hedge fund managers and investment bankers. He has visited a celebrity\u2019s home at 10 p. m. He, too, has an array of clients who go to the salon, among them the tennis champion Roger Federer and John Kennedy Schlossberg, the grandson of the president. \u201cI maintain that men\u2019s prices should be the same as women\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Rogers said last week in an interview from his home in Connecticut. Men, he said, are often more demanding than women. \u201cThe requirement is consistency,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be available anytime, anywhere. \u201d Even if that means being on call 24 hours a day. \u201cThere is never a bad time for them,\u201d he said of his clients. \u201cAnd everything has a price. \u201d The star stylist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai raised eyebrows in the late 1990s when he started charging women $300 for a cut. By the   he was supplanted by Ms. Hershberger, famous for the $600 shaggy mop that defined Meg Ryan\u2019s carefree style at the time. But it is only in recent years that the cost for a man\u2019s haircut has rivaled its feminine counterpart. Now, in New York, it\u2019s not uncommon for a haircut at a top salon to cost $300. And that doesn\u2019t include highlights, straightening or silken glosses. Martial Vivot, a former Parisian who founded Salon Pour Hommes in 2008, charges $320 for one of his signature cuts. Recently, he said, he saw a client bagging groceries at the Whole Foods in Columbus Circle. \u201cI felt like, \u2018Oh, wow,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wondered if he could afford it. \u201d Lakshman Achuthan, the chief operations officer of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, has his short hair groomed by April Barton, famous for the choppy locks of downtown rock \u2019n\u2019 rollers. He pays slightly less than her regular $300 rate, he said, because he visits every four weeks or so. \u201cI\u2019m as far away from Hollande as can be,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a flashy spender. \u201d He has been a client since the 1990s and said he seeks Ms. Barton\u2019s advice as much as the snip of her scissors. \u201cTen years ago she said, \u2018You are losing your hair,\u2019\u201d he explained one recent afternoon, noting that there is much less now to cut. \u201cShe said, \u2018As long as you keep it clean and don\u2019t gain any weight, you\u2019ll be fine. \u2019\u201d Mr. Achuthan is a frequent guest on television, which means he must always be  . \u201cI think it would be easy for someone who has short hair to do a buzz cut,\u201d he said. \u201cBut like every New Yorker, we are jammed up and don\u2019t want to have something go wrong. \u201d Ms. Barton said that, while there is a boom in   barbershops, men with longer or unruly hair often fare better with more instruction. \u201cMost barbers don\u2019t seem to be artful stylists,\u201d she said. She has schooled investment bankers in how to use root concealer to cover gray. Last week, she had a client who paid $670 for a cut, straightening and toning to replenish color. And that didn\u2019t include products and a hefty tip. \u201cThe type of guys who pay this are technology entrepreneurs,\u201d she said. Mr. Rogers, of Sally Hershberger, said that Mr. Federer, who sees a number of stylists worldwide, has a relaxed attitude compared with other clients. \u201cIt\u2019s much more about what Mirka wants,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Federer\u2019s wife. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want his hair to fall in his eyes. \u201d Mr. Federer, he said, \u201cloves his hair. And I love him. \u201d But isn\u2019t $10, 000 a month for a hairdresser, to put it bluntly, a little ridiculous? For decades, scores of Goldman Sachs bankers have had their hair cut by Salvatore Anzalone, an Italian barber with a salon in the lobby of the nearby Conrad Hotel. He charges $30 for a dry cut. (A shampoo is $7 extra.) Not so, Mr. Vivot said. \u201cFrance is the capital of fashion, and he is the president of the country,\u201d he said of Mr. Hollande. The hairdresser is on call, like a doctor. \u201cMaybe if he was in Korea, he\u2019d get a flattop,\u201d he said. Robin Capili, a stylist at Sally Hershberger who trained at a barbershop (and who charges a relatively more affordable $200) said he\u2019d never spend $10, 000 a month. \u201cI\u2019d invest in property,\u201d he said. \u201cA condo maybe. \u201d One of his clients, Drew O\u2019Connell, who lives in Dallas, said that $800 would be a reach, too. But after he tallied up the flight to New York every six weeks (about $400) and other costs, he laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to think about it. \u201d At one point, Ms. Barton said that she would have liked to style the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump. But now, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see him. \u201d Mr. Trump devoted a section of his book \u201cTrump: How to Get Rich\u201d to \u201cThe Art of the Hair,\u201d where he laid out his   philosophy. If he goes bald, he wrote, he would get a toupee. \u201cI\u2019ve never said my hair is my strongest point,\u201d he said. It is unlikely he\u2019ll be visiting Ms. Barton anytime soon.'"}, "time": 1742628515.3192983}
