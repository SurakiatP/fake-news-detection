The deputy minister, who was in Italy when the earthquakes hit, ascribed the natural disasters to divine will.The resolution itself sparked an outcry in Israel and among the international Jewish community since it disregarded the Jewish connection to its holy sites in Jerusalem.\\nKara headed an Israeli delegation to the Vatican which was sent in an effort to shore up opposition for the resolution. Kara even managed to have a short conversation with the Pope during his visit. \\n\u201cGoing through the earthquake wasn\u2019t the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe,\u201d Kara wrote in his memo. \\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision, which the Pope strongly disagreed with. He even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel.\u201d \\nAfter recovering from the earthquake, Kara met with the Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, and tried to convince the cardinal to change the Vatican\u2019s position on the UNESCO decision. \\nTwo earthquakes, which struck Italy this week, were \u201cretribution\u201d for the country\u2019s support of the UNESCO resolution disregarding the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoob Kara said. \\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision,\u201d Kara, a member of the ruling Likud Party, wrote in a memo, Ynetnews website reported. \\nIronically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people. \\nEarlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem \u2013 called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. \\nThe document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document.
