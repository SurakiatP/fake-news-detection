Klein had told how Bill Clinton enjoyed foot rubs, massages and romps in his presidential library with female interns and has described new details about Hillary\u2019s medical crises. Guilty as Sin is available in bookstores and for order from Amazon. James Comey\u2019s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI, including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. \\n\u2019The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn\u2019t recommend an indictment against Hillary,\u2019 said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. \u2018Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,\u2019 said the source. \u2018They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.\u2019 According to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.'"}, "time": 1742563765.6318018}
