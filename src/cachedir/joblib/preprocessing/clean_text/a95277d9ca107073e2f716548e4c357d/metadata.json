There are two competing messages in the media currently about the election. The first message is that Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting. The second message is that a few state polls have shown Trump leading by a little in Florida and gaining ground in New Hampshire. \\nIt is possible that both of these stories are correct. Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting, and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news, some Republicans may be coming back to Trump. \\nThe important thing for Hillary Clinton and Democrats is not to let up. Democrats are very close to generation defining win, but victory is not sealed yet. More polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend, but the polls may not matter. \\nIf most of the ballots in states like North Carolina and Florida are cast before election day, the polls may end up meaning very little. \\nHillary Clinton is in a great position, but judging from her own remarks, she is still working hard to close the deal on November 8. \\nAs Trump pimps his new hotel, Hillary Clinton is pushing even harder to win the White House.'"}, "time": 1742562289.5293458}
