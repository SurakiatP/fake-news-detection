Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on campaigns to remind the public of the dangers of drunken driving, failing to buckle up and texting while on the go. Despite all that, more Americans are dying on roads and highways than in years, and the sudden and sharp increase has alarmed safety advocates. The latest batch of bad news arrived Wednesday in traffic fatality estimates released by the National Safety Council, a nonprofit organization that works closely with federal   regulators. According to its estimates, 40, 200 people died in accidents involving motor vehicles in 2016, a 6 percent rise from the year before. If the estimates are confirmed, it will be the first time since 2007 that more than 40, 000 people have died in motor vehicle accidents in a single year. The 2016 total comes after a 7 percent rise in 2015 and means the   increase  \u2014   14 percent  \u2014   is the largest in more than a half a century. \u201cWhy are we O. K. with this?\u201d Deborah Hersman, the National Safety Council president and chief executive, said at a news conference. \u201cComplacency is killing us. \u201d Part of the increase is believed to stem from the improving economy, which has led Americans to drive more miles for both work and pleasure. But safety advocates say that explains only part of the trend because the number of deaths as a percentage of miles driven is also increasing. They also point to data suggesting an increase in distracted driving. While cars and phones now offer advanced voice controls and other features intended to keep drivers\u2019 eyes on the road, apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Snapchat and others have created new temptations that drivers and passengers find hard to resist. \u201cIt\u2019s not just talking on the phone that\u2019s a problem today,\u201d said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. \u201cYou now have all these other apps that people can use on their phones. \u201d Government officials and safety advocates contend, however, that more than anything else, the increase in deaths has been caused by more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunken driving and speeding regulations by authorities and a reluctance by lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures. A patchwork of state laws leaves many areas where drivers can choose not to buckle up, with little likelihood of being stopped. Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense  \u2014   meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone. In 15 states, failure to wear a seatbelt in front seats is only a secondary offense  \u2014   drivers cannot be given tickets unless they are pulled over for other violations. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same things that are killing drivers  \u2014   belts, booze and speed,\u201d Mr. Adkins said. About half of all traffic fatalities involve unbelted occupants, and almost a third involve drivers who were impaired by drugs or alcohol, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal government\u2019s main   agency. In Alabama, steady budget cuts have resulted in a decline in the number of troopers patrolling the state\u2019s 103, 000 miles of highways. David Brown, a research associate at the University of Alabama\u2019s Center for Advanced Public Safety, studied the state\u2019s 2016 traffic fatality reports and found an increase in fatalities involving   crashes. \u201cTotal crashes were up less than 5 percent, but fatalities were up 25 percent,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think speeding is the No. 1 problem. There are times of the day when we only have one or two troopers on duty in a county, so you can speed, and there\u2019s no one there to deter it. \u201d In some states, highway speed limits are rising. In recent years, Texas has increased speed limits to 85 miles per hour in some rural areas. About 1, 500 miles of roads have a limit of 75 miles per hour or higher. In the fall, the N. H. T. S. A. the National Transportation Safety Board and several nongovernmental organizations, including the National Safety Council, began the Road to Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities within 30 years. The effort places heavy emphasis on the promise of autonomous vehicles. But others say that more needs to be done now on basic road safety issues. \u201cThe way to bring down the rise in deaths is with a wide range of the    measures, not   cars,\u201d the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said in an interview in October. Mr. Nader said states could reduce traffic deaths simply by requiring   occupants to wear seatbelts, installing more cameras to catch speeding drivers without a police presence and tightening regulations on heavy trucking. In presenting its 2016 fatality estimates, the National Safety Council endorsed those ideas and also called for bans on all use of smartphones by drivers, even if they use   calling or messaging. The council is also advocating mandatory motorcycle helmet laws and ignition locks that prevent repeat drunken drivers from operating their vehicles while impaired. The safety council\u2019s figures typically correspond closely to the fatality totals that the N. H. T. S. A. compiles, but they include accidents off public roads and deaths occurring over a longer period after a crash.'"}, "time": 1742628595.062309}
