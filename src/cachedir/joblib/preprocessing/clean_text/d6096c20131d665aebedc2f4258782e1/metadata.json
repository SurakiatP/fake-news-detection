{"duration": 1.6904590129852295, "input_args": {"text": "'After Sunday night\u2019s     when the presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced the wrong best picture, we asked the chief film critics of The New York Times, A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, and the Times critic at large, Wesley Morris, to share their reactions. A. O. SCOTT Wow, that \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d sequel was totally nuts. But in its own way, last night\u2019s spectacle  \u2014   so relatively smooth, until all of a sudden it was anything but  \u2014   represents a Hollywood watershed or, at least, like the original \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d the arrival of a new generation. The envelope   was painful, but it brought to the stage two directors in their 30s with five features between them and reminded the audience that Damien Chazelle and Barry Jenkins are not enemies. The grace with which the \u201cLa La Land\u201d producers (Jordan Horowitz, in particular) handled the handoff  \u2014   and the poise with which Mr. Jenkins and his producer, Adele Romanski, received the belated honor for \u201cMoonlight\u201d  \u2014   should quell the facile polarization that followed the two movies throughout the awards season. And the messiness of the finale makes vivid what turned out to be the theme and the true political message of the night, which was inclusiveness. The   speeches were pointed at times but also muted, with the president\u2019s name mostly unmentioned, and his policies opposed with     appeals. What held it all together was the idea that in Hollywood there is room for everyone. Even Mel Gibson! The two \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d wins strike me as a reminder of the ideological diversity that has always existed in this bastion of liberalism. And the evening, at its best, was both a demonstration of, and an argument for, the value of pluralism, for expansive humanism as an antidote to narrowness and intolerance. MANOHLA DARGIS Most of the evening was weird and bad. (The stunt with the tourists was a   moment of Marie Antoinette obtuseness  \u2014   ah, look, little people!) Then it turned weird and glorious. I shrieked when Mr. Horowitz announced that \u201cMoonlight\u201d had won (did you hear me?) but my heart also went out to the \u201cLa La Land\u201d team. No matter how much I wanted \u201cMoonlight\u201d to win, I wouldn\u2019t wish that kind of public spectacle on anyone, especially a group as pleasant as that behind \u201cLa La Land. \u201d Some on Twitter mocked the \u201cLa La Landers\u201d for having tears in their eyes, so it\u2019s lovely that the filmmakers from both movies were so much more gracious. Jimmy Kimmel could pick up some tips on manners and crisis management from Mr. Horowitz. More to the point, it would be great if the academy finally solved its host problem. Among other things, it would be nice if it found a host who both was actually interested in the art and didn\u2019t mock the movies. (Make fun of the stars in the room  \u2014   that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for.) At the very least, you would think the academy, which has made real if confusing strides toward inclusion, would understand that its   efforts seem a little hollow when a straight, white male host jokes about no one\u2019s seeing a movie from a black director about gay black men. Optics, people, optics! As for Mr. Gibson, well, as the resident kooky conservative, he came off as a kind of proxy for President Trump. WESLEY MORRIS Just to reiterate: THAT HAPPENED, an event that  \u2014   wait, \u201cevent\u201d is too mild. A fiasco? Nightmare? Accidental slip of the entertainment psyche? Act of justice? Honestly, I don\u2019t know. But something happened that seemed to simultaneously tell us who we were, are, believe ourselves to be. This is, what, the fourth time since November that the country has gathered for an evening of live television, only to be part of a   ceremony. After Sunday night, the presidential election, the Super Bowl and, to a different but related extent, the Grammys, I\u2019ve officially come down with     stress disorder  \u2014   Ooptsd, as in upside my head. What went down between the makers of \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cLa La Land\u201d was stunning and strange yet perversely, cosmically right for a night that began with Justin Timberlake\u2019s telling Denzel Washington that surely he recognized the Bill Withers cover Mr. Timberlake was oozing his way through. That moment felt like a distillation of the politics surrounding Mr. Chazelle\u2019s movie. That moment felt like the history of American entertainment distilled into an aside that I don\u2019t even really blame Mr. Timberlake for. If we\u2019ve learned nothing in the past 18 months, if not eight years, it\u2019s that history is bigger than all of us and is always going to rat us out, forcing us to conform to its grip. But I\u2019m with you guys about what gentlemen Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Horowitz were under the most bizarre of circumstances. That errant envelope deprived a proper reckoning of Mr. Jenkins\u2019s achievement  \u2014   and, of course  \u2014   the academy\u2019s. So let\u2019s talk about that. \u201cMoonlight\u201d won best picture. That happened. Hollywood tried to wrest itself from history\u2019s grip. And despite the bizarreness, that feels extraordinary, too. SCOTT \u201cMoonlight\u201d won best picture. That is an outcome I must say I never allowed myself to contemplate, even though I fell for the movie early and hard. I didn\u2019t think it needed the award as proof of its merit  \u2014   no piece of art ever really needs a prize in that way  \u2014   and, in any case, I figured the academy would give it the standard   treatment: a screenwriting and supporting actor prize with the expectation of gratitude for just being included in the festivities. Which was exactly what seemed to be happening. And then (to echo Wesley) something else happened. We\u2019re all still puzzling over what exactly it was. As Mr. Jenkins said: \u201cBut to hell with dreams. I\u2019m done with it, because this is true. \u201d However awkwardly and backwardly the truth was revealed, \u201cMoonlight\u201d won best picture. That fact is something to hold onto, whether it portends a new direction or turns out to be an outlier. Unpredictability, in any case, seems to be the new normal. Some of our most beloved institutions  \u2014   or maybe let\u2019s just say our most begrudgingly tolerated, our most    as a matter of professional obligation  \u2014   no longer function according to established rules and patterns. Or else they do (bad jokes, cheesy musical numbers, careful political statements, predictable winners) until all of a sudden they don\u2019t. That kind of disruption can be upsetting, even horrifying. Last night showed that it can also be beautiful. \u201cMoonlight\u201d won best picture. I will never get tired of saying that. DARGIS But that\u2019s the Oscars, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019re terrible and totally meaningless until the academy picks a movie we love. (Hello, \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d!) Still, while the academy did give \u201cMoonlight\u201d best picture, the fact that Mr. Chazelle won best director suggests that last night was a squeaker. It may be that the academy\u2019s push to diversify itself by adding new members has paid off, but some of the ugliness that aired during the interminable slog up to Sunday night indicates that the academy remains deeply divided. (Sound familiar?) Some of this was the usual campaign nonsense, but more than one white person also suggested that I love \u201cMoonlight\u201d only because it\u2019s a black film. So, yes, the academy got it right, and \u201cMoonlight\u201d is now the first best picture winner to have been directed by an  . To turn back to that other milestone movie: When Kathryn Bigelow won best director for \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d in 2010, some hoped that her historic win would serve as a breakthrough for women, but it hasn\u2019t, and the numbers for female filmmakers are worse now. I don\u2019t want to harsh our mellow, but I also don\u2019t want to overpraise the academy for occasionally getting it right when the industry continues to get it so wrong. \u201cMoonlight,\u201d after all, wasn\u2019t made by one of the big studios, which are more interested in superhero fantasies it was bankrolled by A24, a small, independent company. MORRIS There\u2019s also that. While this was an important night for nonwhite and   filmmakers and actors, American movies continue to be appallingly bad for female filmmakers. Meanwhile, the major studios are out to lunch  \u2014   or at the bank. A24 has the most exciting taste of any American studio,   or  . That \u201cMoonlight\u201d won doesn\u2019t excuse anything. What happens the next year, or the year after, when it\u2019s #OscarSoWhiteAgain? Over and over on Sunday, writers and actors and producers made statements about the urgency for more vivid representation, that we in the audience hunger for it, whether we live in Liberty City (the Miami neighborhood where \u201cMoonlight\u201d is set) or Manchester by the Sea. The three of us spend a few weeks talking about the Academy Awards and the rest of the year out in the marketplace, just watching movies. The real dream would be to arrive at a place where we can watch a film and argue about who\u2019s in it instead of who isn\u2019t. And can I also say, Manohla, that I really liked that moment with the tour group? If they\u2019d been bused in against their will for our entertainment, I\u2019d object. But those sights are, presumably, a version of what they paid that tour company to show them: the world through Jennifer Aniston\u2019s sunglasses. When Mr. Kimmel asked that one woman, a    who her favorite star was, and she pointed to Mr. Washington, my heart melted. We\u2019ve been talking about optics and history, and it felt meaningful to me that the bride, her groom and their complementary   personalities got to meet her favorite movie actor and that, in some way, Mr. Washington got to meet  \u2014   and \u201cmarry\u201d  \u2014   them. For what it\u2019s worth, he was nominated this year for playing an average guy. Sure, that tourist stunt culminated in three black people having a moment around a smartphone. But it was also a fantastical snapshot of a   ideal: weird, wedded bliss.'"}, "time": 1742564609.6294847}
