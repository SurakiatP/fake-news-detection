[\u201cIt makes it seem like it\u2019s all rainbows and puppies,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday, pointing to some of the media comparisons of the healthcare bill proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan and the current coverage offered by Obamacare.  President Donald Trump also found fault with the media for ignoring the dire situation Americans face under Obamacare. \u201cThe press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden,\u201d Trump said to reporters during an event with a handful of Americans who detailed frustrations with Obama\u2019s healthcare plan. He argued that the bill was headed for a disaster in 2017, saying that Republicans were putting themselves in a difficult position by trying to repeal it. \u201cI tell Tom Price, and I tell Paul Ryan. I tell every one of them. I say, \u201cThe best thing you can do politically is wait a year because it\u2019s gonna blow itself off the map. \u2019\u201d Later on Tuesday, Trump pointed to the \u201cfalse\u201d narrative that was building in the media that Obamacare was succeeding. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay. It\u2019s a disaster, and people understand that it\u2019s failed and it\u2019s imploding,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628427.4796004}
