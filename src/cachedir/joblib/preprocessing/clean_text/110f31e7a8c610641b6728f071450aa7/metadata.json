Now, with the Icelandic election just days away (October 29th), the party is back in the news due to an expected strong performance. \\nThe Washington Post explains: \\nREYKJAVIK, ICELAND \u2014 The party that could be on the cusp of winning Iceland\u2019s national elections on Saturday didn\u2019t exist four years ago. \\nIts members are a collection of anarchists, hackers, libertarians and Web geeks. It sets policy through online polls \u2014 and thinks the government should do the same. It wants to make Iceland \u201ca Switzerland of bits,\u201d free of digital snooping. It has offered Edward Snowden a new place to call home. \\nAnd then there\u2019s the name: In this land of Vikings, the Pirate Party may soon be king. \\nTo J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir and other Pirate true believers \u2014 who define their party as neither left nor right, but a radical movement that combines the best of both \u2014 the election here could also be the start of the reboot that Western democracy so desperately needs. \\n\u201cPeople want real changes and they understand that we have to change the systems, we have to modernize how we make laws,\u201d said J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, whose jet-black hair and matching nail polish cut a distinctive profile in a country where politics has long been dominated by paunchy blond men. \\nThe sticker affixed to the back of her chrome-finish laptop stands out, too: an imitation seal of the U.S. government, the familiar arrow-bearing eagle encircled by the words \u201cNational Security Agency Monitored Device.\u201d At the Pirates\u2019 tech-start-up-esque office in an industrial area of Reykjavik\u2019s seafront, a Guy Fawkes mask hangs from the wall and a skull-and-crossbones flag peeks out from a ceramic vase. \\nThe Pirates have spelled out their positions on issues from fishing quotas to online pornography to Snowden. (Party leaders offered him Icelandic citizenship if he can find a way to get here.) But on some of the biggest questions facing the country, the official party position is to punt to the voters. \\nTo party devotees, that\u2019s fine. The Pirates, they say, are less about any specific ideology than they are about a belief that the West\u2019s creaking political systems can be hacked to give citizens a greater say in their democracy. \\n\u201cWe are not here to gain power,\u201d said \u00c1sta Guthr\u00fan Helgad\u00f3ttir, a 26-year-old Pirate member of Parliament. \u201cWe are here to distribute power.\u201d \\nLike everything else, the Pirate Party cannot be seen in a vacuum. A total implosion of the Icelandic economy was necessary to clear the path. \\nAs The Nation notes: \\nIceland\u2019s political status quo\u2014a Nordic-style parliamentary democracy, dominated for decades by pro-NATO conservatives\u2014was shattered when the country went bust in the 2008 financial crisis, pitching Iceland into its deepest crisis since full independence and the republic were declared in 1944. This year, Iceland was rocked again when the Panama Papers leak exposed corruption among top politicos, including the prime minister, who resigned under fire. \u201cPeople here are angry and frustrated,\u201d says Karl Bl\u00f6ndal, deputy editor of the center-right Morgunbladid. \u201cIn the minds of many voters, the Pirates are the only untainted party, and with them Birgitta carries authority. She\u2019s been the face of the opposition since the crash.\u201d \\nIceland\u2019s Pirates, though they currently hold only three spots in the 64-seat parliament, are among the highest-profile of Europe\u2019s Pirate parties. The anarchic hacker-led movement, global in scope, focuses on privacy rights and freedom of expression in the digital age. Born a decade ago in Sweden, and since turbo-charged by WikiLeaks\u2019 and Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures about NSA surveillance, the Pirates have dozens of chapters worldwide, from Australia to Canada, and a headquarters in Geneva. Iceland\u2019s Pirates were the first in the world voted into a national legislature. \\nIndeed, J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir and Iceland\u2019s Pirates see themselves as part of something greater than the direct-democracy uprising they\u2019re leading in the chill North Atlantic. They understand Iceland as the \u201ctest grounds for radical progressive changes,\u201d and they stand for an international legalization of WikiLeaks, asylum for Edward Snowden, and legalizing drugs across Europe. They say they\u2019ll turn diminutive Iceland (a country so small its citizens are listed in the phone book by first names) into an international digital safe haven where data, such as whistle-blower revelations, can be securely transmitted and stored. \\nIn contrast to Europe and the United States, however, Iceland refused to rescue the banks with taxpayer money; instead, the failed banks were renationalized. Iceland chose instead to protect its citizens, first by imposing capital controls so that money couldn\u2019t leave the country and, second, by expanding the social safety net. \u201cIceland did the right thing\u2026creditors, not the taxpayers, shouldered the losses of banks,\u201d said economist and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz in 2011. The bankers were eventually sent to jail: 26 financiers received sentences totaling 74 years. \\nThe possibilities are endless once you start jailing bankers. \\nFor related articles, see:'"}, "time": 1742563422.1507819}
