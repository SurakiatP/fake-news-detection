[However, Berkeley now wish to move the date of her appearance from April 27 to May 2, in a week when there are no classes at the college. Coulter has rejected the proposed change, and plans to speak on the original date as planned.  In addition to facts: We\u2019ve already spent $ for   Berkeley spc  I can\u2019t do May 2  \u2026    THERE ARE NO CLASSES AT BERKELEY THE WEEK OF MAY 2! !!  \u2014   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 21, 2017,  Following violence that occurred at several political protests, Berkeley administrators announced on Wednesday that they had elected to cancel Coulter\u2019s upcoming visit for the sake of protecting student safety. Coulter said in an email to The Washington Post on Wednesday that the university had been \u201cimposing ridiculous demands\u201d on the event but that she and the UCB College Republicans still agreed \u201cto all of their silly requirements. \u201d She said she believes that her speech \u201chas been unconstitutionally banned\u201d by the \u201cpublic,    . \u201d \u201cThey just up and announced that I was prohibited from speaking anyway,\u201d Coulter said, noting that her speech topic was to be immigration, the subject of one of her books. \u201cI feel like the Constitution is important and that   university should not be using public funds to violate American citizens\u2019 constitutional rights. \u201d Despite the administration\u2019s decision to cancel the event, Coulter announced that she would plan to speak anyway. \u201cWhat are they going to do? Arrest me?\u201d she said late Wednesday on the Fox News show \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight. \u201d UC Berkeley\\u200b shuts down . @AnnCoulter\\u200b\u2019s planned speech.

We believe in unqualified support to the First Amendment. But we also have an unqualified focus on safety of our students,\u201d Mogulof said. \u201cWe are going to be making a concerted effort to explain the reasons behind this. \u201d Berkeley professor Robert Reich, who has previously served the Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton, condemned administrators for canceling Coulter\u2019s event. \u201cThis is a grave mistake,\u201d Reich said in a Facebook post. He said universities should \u201cdo everything possible to foster and protect\u201d free speech, writing that students should be allowed to hear Coulter\u2019s arguments and question them. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to cancel an address at the last moment because university and local police are not prepared to contain violence.   \u2026     It\u2019s another thing entirely to cancel an address before it is given, when police have adequate time to prepare for such eventualities,\u201d he added. On Thursday, administrators claimed that they had found a venue where Coulter could hold her event on campus. The event\u2019s date was moved from the originally scheduled date, April 27, to May 2. An administrator claimed that Coulter\u2019s plan to speak on campus regardless forced him to search for \u201cappropriate, protectable venue. \u201d UPDATE: Ann Coulter says she will not accept the changed date, and will speak at Berkeley on April 27 as originally planned.
