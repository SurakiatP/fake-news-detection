The patient goes to a medical office and says, \u201cPlease, doctor, I have this ache, pain, or lump.  Is there anything you can do to help me?\u201d  We can quickly see that this healthcare experience \u2014  including, also, seeking advice for wellness and overall longevity, for oneself or for a loved one \u2014  almost always comes prior to any consideration of paying the bill.   Instead, one\u2019s instinctive and immediate focus is on health that is, we are more naturally interested in the fruits of medical science \u2014  is there anything you can do? \u2014  than in the    of accountancy finance. To put the issue another way, the patient regards his or her problem as, first and foremost, a health issue and then, and only then, a financial issue.  After all, the reason for going to the doctor in the first place is not to wrangle over the eventual bill that might come later.  In the here and now, the purpose of the visit, of course, is to get better.   We can observe that this is basic human nature: If you\u2019re in a theater and someone yells \u201cFire!\u201d your first instinct is flight, to survive worrying about getting a refund on your ticket can wait till you\u2019ve escaped the danger.     Thus the implicit science of a medical situation \u2014  can the doctor help me or not? \u2014  is prior to the finance flesh, blood, and pain take priority over money, debt, and numbers on a ledger.   \u201cHealthcare Policy Is a Loser for Whichever Party Is in Charge\u201d The Value of Hanging Out with a Better Crowd, So is there hope that a Republican Cure Strategy will emerge?  We\u2019ll have to wait and see, of course, but it certainly seems that the cures approach \u2014  as highlighted by Trump and Cruz, and as legislated by Upton and Wicker \u2014  offers Republicans more upside and less downside. In the meantime, we only know this much: The   fusion of science, technology, and vision has worked in the past to promote progress, and it can be made to work, yet again, in the future. Why so optimistic?  We\u2019ll take up that question in the next installment.'"}, "time": 1742562219.8045416}
