Because that\u2019s what one does in Florence? Because you feel compelled to post a selfie in front of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus\u201d? Those are obviously terrible reasons. We shouldn\u2019t go to places because they\u2019re   we should go to fully appreciate the thing that made them    \u2014   an unparalleled collection of Renaissance art, for example. But that requires a thoughtful,   visit, not just following the masses, snapping pictures and checking it off your bucket list. I spoke with those in charge of some of the world\u2019s great attractions to glean strategies for making the most of a visit, both substantive improvements and simple    techniques. Because, no matter how great the view is from the crown of Lady Liberty, you don\u2019t want to wait in a long line to get there. Actually, you can\u2019t visit the crown at all without serious planning. \u201cOn busy days you\u2019re talking 25, 000 people on a small island, and 500 a day get to the crown,\u201d said Michael Amato, the lead park ranger for the Statue of Liberty National Monument. \u201cRight now we\u2019re sold out until late October, early November. \u201d So it\u2019s not so simple as \u201cplan in advance. \u201d You need to check on what\u2019s available only in advance  \u2014   say, tickets for a performance. The ultimate way to avoid crowds is to visit during the   in other words, not now. Many dismiss   travel as unviable because of school schedules, but remember American Thanksgiving and spring breaks (if they don\u2019t fall over Easter week) don\u2019t mirror other countries\u2019 vacations. Some American habits can play to your advantage. \u201cAmericans love to eat early,\u201d said Eike Schmidt, the director of the Uffizi Galleries. \u201cHave an early lunch, and get to the Uffizi something like 1 p. m. when the vast majority of people head off to eat. \u201d Timed tickets can often be bought days in advance and are increasingly available at crowded attractions around the world. At the Uffizi, they cost 4 euros extra (boosting admission to 16. 50 euros, about $18) and take care of waiting in line, if not the crowds. You can buy them at the official Uffizi website, uffizi. it, if you can find it. Unofficial sites that look official are rampant. They often look good and sometimes contain good information, but look out. \u201cYou can pay $30 or $40 on a fake website,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cAnd sometimes the tickets do not exist\u201d  \u2014   that is, they\u2019re fakes. Even when they\u2019re just reselling real tickets, look out for markups. For example, uffizi. com, one of the unofficial sites, charges 24. 99 euros (about $27. 35) and it even marks up the audio guides. The official site is   and difficult to find (and is getting an upgrade). If you\u2019re ever having trouble finding the official site of any attraction, search for it on a trusted travel site  \u2014   say, LonelyPlanet. com  \u2014   and follow the links. Between planning and traveling, a lot can change. Keep up to date, Jade McKellar, the director of visitor experiences at the Sydney Opera House, said in an email. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for inspiration,\u201d she said, \u201cfollow us on social media and sign up for our newsletter. \u201d The Opera House\u2019s Facebook page, for example, recently posted information on the free   Homeground festival in October, featuring indigenous musicians from around the world. In another development somewhat lower on the cultural scale, the Statue of Liberty\u2019s Instagram account recently noted a new wave of visitors to Ellis Island: Pok\u00e9mon. Ms. McKellar noted that too many visitors \u201cstop at the selfie. \u201d Even without planning, visitors can often buy tickets for events that run 363 days a year. But like many sites, a true visit means dedicating a full day, something a rushed traveler might be loath to do but should do. You may want to append to a tour of the Sydney Opera House a pretheater dinner at the locavore Australian restaurant Bennelong, and an evening performance. (Just be aware that reservations at Bennelong need to be made well ahead.) Another reason to set aside more time: Visitors skip the   but equally worthwhile, often beautifully complementary sites nearby. Susan Greaney, the senior properties historian at English Heritage, which oversees Stonehenge, recommended a trip to the nearby Wiltshire Museum and the Salisbury Museum, local history museums with   exhibitions, each less than a   drive away but apt to be missed by anyone on a day tour from London. Mark Thomas, the western district director of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation  \u2014   a fancy title that involves oversight of Niagara Falls State Park  \u2014   recommended the New York Power Authority\u2019s Niagara Power Vista, a free attraction that was recently overhauled and reopened, 10 minutes away from the park. Mr. Schmidt noted that the copy of Michelangelo\u2019s David on the Piazza della Signoria near the Uffizi was indistinguishable to nonexperts. Lines to see the real one at the Accademia Gallery can run hours if you don\u2019t buy tickets in advance. \u201cIf someone has just three days in Florence, do you want to waste three hours in line when you can see a very faithful copy?\u201d he said. Sometimes, the   attraction is even part of the same complex. Mr. Amato noted that this year Liberty Island would attract 4. 4 million visitors, while the Ellis Island Museum of Immigration will attract just 2. 4 million. That\u2019s preposterous, considering that the boat to Liberty Island also stops at Ellis Island, which costs nothing extra and (in my opinion, not his) is far more interesting. But again, it means killing a day. Reading up on the attraction can make a vast difference in how much you appreciate it. I slogged through \u201cThe Conquest of the Incas\u201d by John Hemming before visiting Machu Picchu for the first time, and it made for a rich experience. But there are easier ways. Mr. Thomas recommended visitors watch Marilyn Monroe in the 1953 film noir picture \u201cNiagara,\u201d set at and near the falls. And in the next six months, Mr. Schmidt\u2019s book about the Uffizi should come out. (Exercise some discretion  \u2014   for example, Ms. Greaney of English Heritage did not mention the Stonehenge scene from the 1984 mockumentary \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap,\u201d and for good reason.) Some final recommendations: Be an active visitor, engaging guides, rangers or docents and exploring   corners. For    monuments, consider a more adventurous alternative route to avoid crowds  \u2014   walking the steep hill to the Peak viewpoint in Hong Kong or hiking up the rain forest path to Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro instead of taking the crowded trams that lead to each. Even if you\u2019re not traveling with children, I recommend inventing a game before you go  \u2014   even adults run out of steam on a long day of sightseeing. My favorite, applicable to any museum with abstract art, is \u201cName the Picasso,\u201d in which you guess the name of a painting (\u201cDeath in the Jungle\u201d) and then compare it to its real name (\u201cNude in a Black Armchair. \u201d) Of course, you can also simply skip the   attraction. If you\u2019re sick of museums by the time you get to Florence, forgo the Uffizi and take advantage of other things Florence has to offer. Perhaps a gelato (or tripe sandwich) crawl is in order? Don\u2019t worry about what your friends will think. You can use Photoshop to show them you \u201csaw\u201d \u201cThe Birth of Venus. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562146.3701482}
