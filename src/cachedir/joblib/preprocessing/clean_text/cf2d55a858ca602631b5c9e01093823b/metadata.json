This is just the next mad phase. \\nI\u2019m not sure most Americans have figured out what\u2019s happening in Syria, because so much of what we hear is confusing to us, and really, we know so little of the context for it. Is it an insurgency against a brutal ruler? Is it a group of insurgencies struggling for power in a nearly failed state? Is it a proxy war expressing the territorial and ideological interests of the U.S., Russia, Turkey and Iran? \\nOr something else? \\nAccording to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. it is something else \u2014 a war between competing national interests to build, or not build, a pipeline to the Mediterranean so natural gas can be exported to Europe. Inconveniently for Syria, that nation lies along an obvious pipeline route. \\nWhich makes it another war between interests for money \u2014 something not very hard to understand at all. \\nHere\u2019s Kennedy\u2019s argument via EcoWatch. This is a long piece, well worth a full read, but I\u2019ll try to present just the relevant sections here. \\nThe Historical Context: Decades of CIA-Sponsored Coups and Counter-Coups in Syria \\nKennedy\u2019s introductory section contains an excellent examination of the history of U.S. involvement in Syria starting in the 1950s with the Cold War machinations of the Eisenhower-appointed Dulles brothers, John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of State, and Allen Dulles, the head of the CIA. Together, they effectively ruled U.S. foreign policy. \\nKennedy writes (my emphasis): \\nSyria: Another Pipeline War \\n\u2026 America\u2019s unsavory record of violent interventions in Syria\u2014obscure to the American people yet well known to Syrians \u2014sowed fertile ground for the violent Islamic Jihadism that now complicates any effective response by our government to address the challenge of ISIS. So long as the American public and policymakers are unaware of this past, further interventions are likely to only compound the crisis. Moreover, our enemies delight in our ignorance. \\n\u2026 [W]e need to look at history from the Syrians\u2019 perspective and particularly the seeds of the current conflict. Long before our 2003 occupation of Iraq triggered the Sunni uprising that has now morphed into the Islamic State, the CIA had nurtured violent Jihadism as a Cold War weapon and freighted U.S./Syrian relationships with toxic baggage. \\nDuring the 1950\u2019s, President Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers rebuffed Soviet treaty proposals to leave the Middle East a cold war neutral zone and let Arabs rule Arabia. Instead, they mounted a clandestine war against Arab Nationalism\u2014which CIA Director Allan [sic] Dulles equated with communism\u2014particularly when Arab self-rule threatened oil concessions. They pumped secret American military aid to tyrants in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon favoring puppets with conservative Jihadist ideologies which they regarded as a reliable antidote to Soviet Marxism. At a White House meeting between the CIA\u2019s Director of Plans, Frank Wisner, and Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, in September of 1957, Eisenhower advised the agency, \u201cWe should do everything possible to stress the \u2018holy war\u2019 aspect.\u201d \\nThe CIA began its active meddling in Syria in 1949 \u2014barely a year after the agency\u2019s creation. Syrian patriots had declared war on the Nazis, expelled their Vichy French colonial rulers and crafted a fragile secularist democracy based on the American model. But in March of 1949, Syria\u2019s democratically elected president, Shukri-al-Kuwaiti, hesitated to approve the Trans Arabian Pipeline, an American project intended to connect the oil fields of Saudi Arabia to the ports of Lebanon via Syria. In his book, Legacy of Ashes , CIA historian Tim Weiner recounts that in retaliation, the CIA engineered a coup , replacing al-Kuwaiti with the CIA\u2019s handpicked dictator , a convicted swindler named Husni al-Za\u2019im. Al-Za\u2019im barely had time to dissolve parliament and approve the American pipeline before his countrymen deposed him , 14 weeks into his regime. \\nKennedy then details the history of coups and counter-coups in and against Syria, and concludes this section with this: \\nThanks in large part to Allan Dulles and the CIA, whose foreign policy intrigues were often directly at odds with the stated policies of our nation, the idealistic path outlined in the Atlantic Charter was the road not taken. In 1957, my grandfather, Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, sat on a secret committee charged with investigating CIA\u2019s clandestine mischief in the Mid-East . The so called \u201cBruce Lovett Report,\u201d to which he was a signatory, described CIA coup plots in Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Egypt, all common knowledge on the Arab street, but virtually unknown to the American people who believed, at face value, their government\u2019s denials. \\nThe report blamed the CIA for the rampant anti-Americanism that was then mysteriously taking root \u201cin the many countries in the world today.\u201d\u2026 A parade of Iranian and Syrian dictators, including Bashar al-Assad and his father , have invoked the history of the CIA\u2019s bloody coups as a pretext for their authoritarian rule, repressive tactics and their need for a strong Russian alliance. These stories are therefore well known to the people of Syria and Iran who naturally interpret talk of U.S. intervention in the context of that history. \\nWhile the compliant American press parrots the narrative that our military support for the Syrian insurgency is purely humanitarian, many Syrians see the present crisis as just another proxy war over pipelines and geopolitics. Before rushing deeper into the conflagration, it would be wise for us to consider the abundant facts supporting that perspective. \\nSo much for our supposed interest in \u201chumanitarian\u201d intervention in Syria. From a Syrian point of view, it has never been thus. It has been about pipelines since 1949, and they understand that, even if we don\u2019t. \\nThe Current Conflagration \\nKennedy then turns to the present, or the near-present. Refer to the map above as you read: \\nA Pipeline War \\nIn [the Syrians\u2019] view, our war against Bashar Assad did not begin with the peaceful civil protests of the Arab Spring in 2011. Instead it began in 2000 when Qatar proposed to construct a $10 billion, 1,500km pipeline through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey . \\nQatar shares with Iran, the South Pars/North Dome gas field, the world\u2019s richest natural gas repository. The international trade embargo, until recently, prohibited Iran from selling gas abroad and ensured that Qatar\u2019s gas could only reach European markets if it is liquefied and shipped by sea, a route that restricts volume and dramatically raises costs. \\nThe EU, which gets 30 percent of its gas from Russia, was equally hungry for the pipeline which would have given its members cheap energy and relief from Vladimir Putin\u2019s stifling economic and political leverage. Turkey, Russia\u2019s second largest gas customer, was particularly anxious to end its reliance on its ancient rival and to position itself as the lucrative transect hub for Asian fuels to EU markets. The Qatari pipeline would have benefited Saudi Arabia\u2019s conservative Sunni Monarchy by giving them a foothold in Shia dominated Syria. \\nThe Saudi\u2019s geopolitical goal is to contain the economic and political power of the Kingdom\u2019s principal rival, Iran , a Shiite state, and close ally of Bashar Assad. The Saudi monarchy viewed the U.S. sponsored Shia takeover in Iraq as a demotion to its regional power and was already engaged in a proxy war against Tehran in Yemen, highlighted by the Saudi genocide against the Iranian backed Houthi tribe. \\nWhich puts the Qatari pipeline squarely opposite to Russia\u2019s national interest \u2014 natural gas (methane) sales to Europe. \\nOf course, the Russians, who sell 70 percent of their gas exports to Europe, viewed the Qatar/Turkey pipeline as an existential threat. In Putin\u2019s view, the Qatar pipeline is a NATO plot to change the status quo, deprive Russia of its only foothold in the Middle East, strangle the Russian economy and end Russian leverage in the European energy market. In 2009, Assad announced that he would refuse to sign the agreement to allow the pipeline to run through Syria \u201cto protect the interests of our Russian ally.\u201d \\nThat was likely the last straw vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. Which brings us to another pipeline, the so-called \u201cIslamic Pipeline\u201d (see map above): \\n\u201cAssad further enraged the Gulf\u2019s Sunni monarchs by endorsing a Russian approved \u201cIslamic pipeline\u201d running from Iran\u2019s side of the gas field through Syria and to the ports of Lebanon. The Islamic pipeline would make Shia Iran instead of Sunni Qatar, the principal supplier to the European energy market and dramatically increase Tehran\u2019s influence in the Mid-East and the world. Israel also was understandably determined to derail the Islamic pipeline which would enrich Iran and Syria and presumably strengthen their proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas. \\nAnother, competing pipeline which would run through Syrian territory, but this time carrying Iranian gas instead of Qatari gas. Thus the demonizing of Assad as evil in the mold of Saddam Hussein, instead of just a run-of-the-mill Middle East autocrat, as bad as some but better than others. Kennedy includes a good section on the history of the al-Assad family\u2019s rule of Syria, including this information from top reporters Sy Hersh and Robert Parry: \\nAccording to Hersh, \u201cHe certainly wasn\u2019t beheading people every Wednesday like the Saudis do in Mecca.\u201d Another veteran journalist, Bob Parry, echoes that assessment. \u201cNo one in the region has clean hands but in the realms of torture, mass killings, civil liberties and supporting terrorism, Assad is much better than the Saudis.\u201d \\nIn September 2013, the Sunni states involved in the Qatar-Turkey pipeline were so determined to remove Syrian opposition to the pipeline that they offered, via John Kerry, to carry the whole cost of an U.S. invasion to topple al-Assad. \\nKerry reiterated the offer to Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL27): \u201cWith respect to Arab countries offering to bear the costs of [an American invasion] to topple Assad, the answer is profoundly Yes, they have. The offer is on the table.\u201d \\nObama\u2019s response: \\nDespite pressure from Republicans, Barrack Obama balked at hiring out young Americans to die as mercenaries for a pipeline conglomerate . Obama wisely ignored Republican clamoring to put ground troops in Syria or to funnel more funding to \u201cmoderate insurgents.\u201d But by late 2011, Republican pressure and our Sunni allies had pushed the American government into the fray. \\nThe rest is a history of provocation and over-reaction \u2014 a great deal of both \u2014 and chaos and death in Syria. Kennedy provides much detail here, at one point adding: \\n[Syria\u2019s] moderates are fleeing a war that is not their war . They simply want to escape being crushed between the anvil of Assad\u2019s Russian backed tyranny and the vicious Jihadi Sunni hammer that we had a hand in wielding in a global battle over competing pipelines . You can\u2019t blame the Syrian people for not widely embracing a blueprint for their nation minted in either Washington or Moscow. The super powers have left no options for an idealistic future that moderate Syrians might consider fighting for. And no one wants to die for a pipeline. \\nI\u2019ll leave it there, but again, do read the entire piece if you want to truly understand what\u2019s going on in Syria, and what is about to go on. \\nBottom Line \\nBottom line, it\u2019s as Kennedy said: \u201cNo one wants to die for a pipeline\u201d\u2026 but many do and will. \\nI\u2019ll offer three thoughts. One , if we weren\u2019t so determined to be deeply dependent on fossil fuels, this would be their war, not ours. Two , we are deeply dependent on fossil fuels because of the political machinations of the oil companies, their CEOs, and the banks and hedge funds who fund them, all of whom pay our government officials \u2014 via campaign contributions and the revolving door \u2014 to prolong that dependence. We\u2019re here because the holders of big oil money want us here. \\nAnd three , keep all this in mind during the term of the next president. It will help you make sense of the phony warrior- cum -humanitarian arguments we\u2019re almost certain to be subjected to. \\nWe have been at war in Syria over pipelines since 1949. This is just the next mad phase. 0 0 0 0 1 1'"}, "time": 1742564597.8174047}
