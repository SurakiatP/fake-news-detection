The statement, published on Thursday on the website of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in Wales, also known as BAFTA Cymru, said: \u201cTerry has been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a variant of frontotemporal dementia. This illness affects his ability to communicate, and he is no longer able to give interviews. \u201d On Friday, Ben Timlett, a producer on one of Mr. Jones\u2019s films, said in an email that Mr. Jones\u2019s son Bill confirmed that the statement had been released to BAFTA Cymru on behalf of the family. BAFTA Cymru chose Terry Jones  \u2014   a Welsh comedian known for his Python characters like a doting mother of a coal worker son criticized for being a slacker by his playwright father and an everyday Superman who needs his bicycle repaired  \u2014   to receive its award for Outstanding Contribution to Film and Television. Hannah Raybould, the director of BAFTA Cymru, said a retrospective of Mr. Jones\u2019s work starting from 1969 would still be celebrated at an awards ceremony in Cardiff on Oct. 2. \u201cTerry is proud and honored to be recognized in this way and is looking forward to the celebrations,\u201d the statement said. Lydia Jones, a spokeswoman for BAFTA Cymru, said Friday that the organization had been told there would be no further details on Mr. Jones\u2019s condition. Primary progressive aphasia is a rare nervous system syndrome that affects a person\u2019s ability to express his or her thoughts and understanding, or to find words, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms begin gradually, often before age 65, and worsen over time. The news of the diagnosis was also reported by the BBC and Britain\u2019s National Press Association. The announcement of Mr. Jones\u2019s illness dominated Monty Python fan sites on Friday, where it was described as \u201csad\u201d and \u201cterrible\u201d news. Eric Idle, a   of the ribald, outrageous and internationally acclaimed British troupe, tweeted thanks to fans for their support while noting Mr. Jones\u2019s participation in the 2014 stage reunion of the comedy gang. Mr. Jones, 74, was born in Colwyn Bay, a seaside community on the north coast of Wales. He has written and directed dramas, presented documentaries, composed operas and penned short stories, as BAFTA Cymru noted. But it is his work in the Monty Python television series, which was brought to the stage in London in 2014, that arguably contributed most to his fame. He worked on some of the troupe\u2019s   films, including \u201cLife of Brian,\u201d 1979 (director and a writer) \u201cThe Meaning of Life,\u201d 1983 (a writer and, with Terry Gilliam, a director) and \u201cMonty Python and the Holy Grail,\u201d 1975 (a writer and  ). Last year, Mr. Jones released the documentary  \u201cBoom Bust Boom,\u201d about how the economy cycles through periods of growth and collapse. \u201cThis film is about the Achilles\u2019 heel of capitalism,\u201d Mr. Jones says at the opening of the film. \u201cHow human nature drives the economy to crisis after crisis, time and time again. \u201d A review in The New York Times called it ominous but enjoyable. In addition to   Mr. Jones helped to direct the project.'"}, "time": 1742562675.1176827}
