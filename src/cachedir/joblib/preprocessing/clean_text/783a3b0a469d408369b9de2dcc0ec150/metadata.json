Bannon and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus received a standing ovation and a heroes\u2019 welcome at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday afternoon. [Bannon joked that he had graduated from the ranks of the \u201cuninvited\u201d  \u2014   the title of an alternative conference that he led as the executive chairman of Breitbart News, which featured speakers who had been left off the CPAC agenda.  Asked by American Conservative Union chair Matt Schlapp to name the biggest misconception about the Trump White House, and their work together, Priebus replied: \u201cEverything. \u201d Bannon agreed, repeating one of his most controversial lines of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration thus far, greeting \u201cthe opposition\u201d  \u2014   the media  \u2014   in the back of the room. He referred to them as such throughout his remarks, recalling how the \u201copposition party\u201d had constantly disparaged the Trump campaign, to no avail. \u201cIf you want to see the Trump agenda, it\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the speeches. \u201d He added: \u201cOur job, every day, is to execute on that. \u201d But the \u201copposition party\u201d missed the story, he said. \u201cJust like they were dead wrong on the cast of the campaign, just like they were dead wrong on the cast of the transition, they are absolutely wrong about what\u2019s going on today. \u201d Bannon outlined the administration\u2019s approach to implementing its agenda, including what he termed the historically significant withdrawal from the   Partnership (TPP) which he said would be replaced by bilateral trade arrangements. He said that Trump\u2019s Cabinet appointees would lead the \u201cdeconstruction\u201d of the \u201cadminstrative state. \u201d Priebus, picking up on that theme, proudly described Trump\u2019s executive order requiring that for every new regulation promulgated by federal agencies, two old regulations had to be repealed. When Schlapp asked what the media kept missing about Trump, Priebus pointed out that the media were constantly underestimating Trump\u2019s chances  \u2014   first of winning the Republican nomination, then of winning the presidency, then of governing successfully. He expressed hope that the media would improve. Bannon, noting that he and Priebus could disagree and still work together, offered a different outlook on media bias: \u201cIt\u2019s not only not going to get better, it\u2019s going to get worse every day,\u201d he said, adding that the \u201ccorporatist, globalist media\u201d were opposed to change. Conservatives, Bannon told the audience to applause, would have to remain active and involved. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to get your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken. \u201d He asked the audience to have the administration\u2019s back  \u2014   but asked them: \u201cHold us accountable. \u201d Asked to say what they liked best about each other, Priebus praised Bannon, \u201ca very dear friend,\u201d for being loyal and \u201cextremely consistent. \u201d Bannon praised Priebus for being \u201cindefatigable\u201d and \u201csteady\u201d under intense pressure. \u201cI can run a little hot sometimes,\u201d he joked. \u201cReince has been unwavering. \u201d Joel B.
