Keshe, whose plasma related defense technologies, threaten the military balance of power, disabling American stealth drones and even leaving an AEGIS destroyer floating, dead in the water, in the Black Sea. Anti-Keshe \u201ctroll\u201d and convicted pedophile Sterling Allen, former Rense Radio host, now serving a life sentence, is said to have supplied the encryption keys that allowed the FBI to take over the Netherlands based site. From NBC: \u201cThe website operated from a server based in the Netherlands and, at its height, boasted up to 70,000 members worldwide,\u201d it added. \u201cIt attempted to operate as a \u2018discussion\u2013only\u2019 forum where people could share their sexual interest in young boys without committing any specific offences, thus operating \u2018below the radar\u2019 of police attention,\u201d Europol said. Police infiltrated site The Europol statement said U.K. and Australian police infiltrated the site to identify the members who posed the greatest danger to children. Police also sometimes posed as children online as part of the investigation. Law enforcement authorities from 13 countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain and the U.K., were involved in the case, Europol said. The statement said Europol analysts had cracked the security features of a key computer server at the center of the network which uncovered the identities of suspected child sex offenders. And, after his arrest, the forum\u2019s Dutch administrator helped police break encryption measures that shielded users\u2019 identities, allowing police to begin their covert investigations. \u201cEuropol subsequently issued over 4,000 intelligence reports to police authorities in over 30 countries in Europe and elsewhere, which has led to the arrests of suspects and the safeguarding of children,\u201d Europol said. In September 2015, Iranian physicist Mehran T. Keshe met with the FBI in Rome, a meeting set up by VT. From a source at Europol: It was this from Veterans Today that helped push this forward: \u201cIt was Keshe\u2019s information given to the FBI in Italy that led to the seizure of Sterling Allan\u2019s computer back in January of 2016, which led to the Obama White House getting files tying Justice \u201cTony\u201d Scalia to a child sex ring and demonstrating that it was Scalia that had protected Allan. \u201c With Justice Scalia exposed to Obama blackmail, his own friends smothered him to death with a pillow, and walked past police, while the world moved on, no autopsy, no investigation.\u201d Read: Former Victim Claims Scalia Was a Pedophile That explains why Hollande (President of the French Republic) was scared he is linked to child abuse in France, via Belgium as well. Abdessalem (Foreign Minister of Tunisia) was traded by the FBI so Hollande can stay in power, sign the tafta and much more allow American military presence in France, which is now turning against him\u2026 That explains why the US military unit near Milan was behind us to see what we had in stock against Bibi (Netanyahu) and Hollande\u2026 now that they have Hollande, they are pushing him to the edge, using pressure on Sarkozy, right hand of Bibi, they moved in Tripoli, blackmailing Roma. Thus, what begins as a hundred arrests, when you peel the levels, involves the French elections and even the recent Bataclan attack in Paris now tied to, if you can imagine it, a police informant smuggled into France through Italy by Tunisia, who out of curiosity runs an anti-Keshe website. Why do they hate Keshe? Pedophilia Bombshells \u2014 The Sick World of the 'Elite':\""}, "time": 1742562229.6558921}
