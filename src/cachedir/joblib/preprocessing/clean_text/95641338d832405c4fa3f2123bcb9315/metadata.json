[\u201cI thought Meryl [Streep in Florence Foster Jenkins] played it like a clown  \u2014   she\u2019s cute and adorable, but this woman didn\u2019t matter to me in the end  \u2014   but people are gaga over Meryl, and I think she solidified her nomination when she gave that speech at the Golden Globes,\u201d the anonymous Oscar voter told the Hollywood Reporter.   The Academy member  \u2014   a female member of the acting branch  \u2014   added: \u201cI don\u2019t think she would have gotten nominated without it. \u201d In January, Streep used her Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award acceptance speech at the Golden Globes to rebuke President Trump for what she called his \u201cdisrespect\u201d and his \u201cviolence\u201d the actress also challenged a \u201cprincipled press\u201d to stand up to the president, and urged Hollywood to support the Committee to Protect Journalists. The    \u2019s Globes speech was lauded by the film industry and the press and set the tone for other awards shows to feature     screeds. Later that month, actors including Ashton Kutcher and Julia   trashed Trump and his executive order on immigration from the podium at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. In February, a number of artists at the 59th annual Grammy Awards used their performances to make political statements, including Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest and Katy Perry. The Hollywood Reporter solicits opinions from anonymous Oscar voters every year in the week before the ceremony. While the responses of one Academy member are hardly an indication of how the entirety of the 6, 000+ members will ultimately vote, the   \u201cbrutally honest\u201d ballots usually offer a refreshing perspective on the process. In addition to her comments on Streep, this year\u2019s anonymous voter said La La Land star Emma Stone\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t \u201cas wonderful\u201d as everyone is saying, the   thriller Arrival \u201cjust sucked\u201d and the Denzel   Davis starring Fences underwhelmed because \u201cthey just filmed the play. \u201d See the rest of the anonymous voter\u2019s \u201cbrutally honest\u201d ballot here.
