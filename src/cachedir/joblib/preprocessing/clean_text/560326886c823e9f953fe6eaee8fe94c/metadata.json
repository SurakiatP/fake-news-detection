[The mocking article, headlined \u201cLindsay Lohan May Have Made Her Worst Life Choice Yet,\u201d mocked Lohan for her public endorsements of Islam, and warned her that multiple other   converts have subsequently gotten themselves jailed or killed while trying to implement Islam\u2019s many calls for jihad against  .  Lindsay Lohan has sparked widespread speculation that she has converted to Islam by deleting everything on her Instagram account except for the Arabic greeting \u201cAlaikum salam\u201d (upon you be peace)  \u2026     So what\u2019s not to like? Converts and prospective converts are never told about how so many converts to Islam end up as jihad terrorists, most notably including John Walker Lindh, the \u201cMarin County Mujahid\u201d who was discovered fighting alongside the Taliban and   against American troops in Afghanistan, and Adam Gadahn, the   \u201crevolting geek of mass proportions\u201d who, like Lindh, discovered Islam through rap music and black grievance theater (neither were black, but both wished they were) read the Qur\u2019an and realized that one   way to please Allah was to wage jihad against infidels, and set out to do just that.   \u2026     Gadahn, Lindh, and numerous other converts illustrate the appeal of conversion to Islam among the psychically marginal, who find comfort in the fact that Islam has a rule (and sometimes many rules) for every imaginable human activity, relieving them of the responsibility of having to make tough moral and ethical decisions themselves. The article was penned by Robert Spencer, the prolific and   author of many books about Islam, including book, Did Muhammed Exist? An Inquiry Into Islam\u2019s Obscure Origins. Spencer also runs the Jihad Watch website, and frequently asks Islamic advocates to engage in   public debate. As he repeatedly says, Spencer does not argue that all Muslims are radicals or jihadis. Instead, he simply argues that the written, hegemonic doctrines of orthodox Islam encourage many Muslims to provide charity to each other, and to tolerate, support or even demonstrate hostility and aggression towards  . Similarly, while not all Christians are pacifist, saintly or charitable, orthodox Christian doctrines encourage believers to promote generosity towards others and to use violence only as a last resort. In his article for The Hill, Spencer criticized Islam by referring to commandments in the Koran, which Islam says is the perfectly copied transcript of their deity\u2019s unchangeable,   commandments. Lohan has fueled this kind of speculation [about a possible conversion to Islam] in the past, saying in 2015: \u201cMy very close friends, who have been there for me a lot, in London are Saudi and they gave me the Qur\u2019an and I brought it to New York because I was learning. It opened doors for me to experience spiritually, to find another true meaning. This is who I am. \u201d She didn\u2019t say what \u201ctrue meaning\u201d she found in Qur\u2019anic injunctions sanctioning   (Qur\u2019an 4:34) devaluing of women\u2019s testimony (Qur\u2019an 2:282) and inheritance rights (Qur\u2019an 4:11) allowance for polygamy (Qur\u2019an 4:3) or mandate of warfare against and subjugation of unbelievers (Qur\u2019an 9:29) but that\u2019s just the beginning of the absurdity. The Hill says \u201cThe Hill stands alone in delivering solid,   and objective reporting on the business of Washington, covering the   of Congress, as well as the nexus between politics and business. The Hill serves to connect the players, define the issues and influence the way Washington\u2019s decision makers view the debate. \u201d The Hill declined to explain its decision to Breitbart. When asked about TheHill\u2018s takedown, Spencer told Breitbart, \u201cI had never been published there before. I don\u2019t care about Lohan and never would have written about her, but they asked me to. \u201d Before this episode, Spencer said he has never seen one of his articles removed after publication. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had an article published and then taken down before. \u201d Spencer pins the blame on Bob Cusack, The Hill\u2018s   . \u201cSharia cowardice at @thehill,\u201d Spencer Tweeted. Spencer also called for Cusack\u2019s firing. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start a pushback for truth and free speech: Fire Fascist Bob!\u201d It\u2019s time to start a pushback for truth and free speech: Fire Fascist Bob! @BobCusack @thehill https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Robert Spencer (@jihadwatchRS) January 19, 2017,  Spencer also scoffed at the Muslims\u2019 complaints about his article, noting that his opponents have not mounted a   criticism of his article\u2019s facts, logic and fairness. \u201cThe Left traffics in demonization and marginalization of its foes, as it cannot meet them on an even playing field intellectually,\u201d he told Breitbart. Among those celebrating the removal of the article was the Washington Post\u2018s   correspondent covering Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, Liz Sly. Sly called Spencer\u2019s article \u201crabidly Islamophobic. \u201d A phobia is defined as \u201can extreme or irrational fear of or aversion to something,\u201d and is regarded as a mental illness. The Hill (@thehill) has removed that rabidly Islamophobic article on Lindsay Lohan from its website. Good for them https:  .   \u2014   Liz Sly (@LizSly) January 19, 2017,  Breitbart asked Sly at the Washington Post to explain her comments, and received this Tweet in response.

CAIR has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted   in a   operation. Hey @bobcusack just saw Robert Spencer\u2019s vile   article on ur publication @thehill Next will u give  + racists platform,  \u2014   (((DeanObeidallah))) (@Deanofcomedy) January 18, 2017,  The CAIR group is so closely entwined with Islamists and with jihadis that court documents and news reports show that at least five of its people  \u2014   either board members, employees or former employees  \u2014   have been jailed or repatriated from the United States for various financial and   offenses. The record highlighted by critics also shows that CAIR was named an unindicted   in a   criminal effort to deliver $12 million to the HAMAS jihad group, that it was founded with $490, 000 from HAMAS, and that the FBI bans   meetings with CAIR officials. Multiple   translations of the Koran have been posted here, here and here on the Internet by orthodox Islamic advocates, allowing Americans to individually study Islam\u2019 combination of religion and ideology. Spencer   an 2015 art exhibition in Texas, featuring conventional cartoons of the Islamic prophet. Two armed Muslims attacked the exhibition, but were quickly killed by Spencer\u2019s security guards before they could do more harm. Spencer hired the security guards because he expected Islam\u2019s doctrines would push some Muslims to attack his art show. Since then, Spencer has continued his writing and debating about Islam\u2019s jihad doctrine. Breitbart. com has published several articles by Spencer, and has quoted him numerous times. The Spencer article, and the readers\u2019 comments, are archived here. The article has been updated with a reply from Sly at the Washington Post. '"}, "time": 1742563618.229677}
