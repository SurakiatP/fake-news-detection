[\u201cThe Washington Post and L. A. Times spent more than a month working on stories that were exclusively about Senator Sessions and race. Their attempt to define him not by his last twenty years in the Senate, but by the notion that he was white, conservative, evangelical, and from the South meant, in their view, that he could not escape the label of being a racist,\u201d said Blackwell.  \u201cThey don\u2019t use facts,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t use measurable, observable behavior and activity. They, in fact, create this false image of a guy who they would like to bring down because they see him as the tip of the spear of moving us back to a system that respects the rule of law   \u2026     that respects the Constitution. \u201d Blackwell said, \u201cThis is an   political attack. This is an effort to misdefine Jeff Sessions in a way that they can destroy him. \u201d \u201cThis is,\u201d he added, \u201cpure and simple, the borking of Jeff Sessions. They did it to Judge Bork in the eighties, and they\u2019re trying to do it now to Jeff Sessions. \u201d Blackwell predicted the effort will fail and Sessions will be confirmed.
