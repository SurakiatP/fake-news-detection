Trump immediately pounces on the opportunity to show how tough he is to his rabid supporters. \\n\u201cWe have a protester!\u201d he said . Trump then said this to Cary: \u201cBy the way, were you paid $1,500 to be a thug?\u201d \\nAs the man was escorted out by Trump\u2019s security team, the crowd erupted into chants of \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump,\u201d as the candidate bellowed \u201cYou can get him out. Get him out.\u201d \\nC.J. Cary is a 63-year old former Marine who has been a Trump supporter ever since the billionaire replied to a 1992 letter Cary sent during Trump\u2019s first divorce. \\nCary made his way to the rally on Wednesday to see his hero and deliver a personal message via note to the GOP candidate. The note contained a bit of advice for the nominee, basically telling him to stop saying offensive things about women, minorities, and people with disabilities on the campaign trail, otherwise \u201clying Hillary\u201d will beat him in November. \\nHowever, the former Marine never had an opportunity to make it more than 30 feet from his favorite candidate before being stopped and unceremoniously thrown out of the venue by the candidate himself. \\nCary said he tried to explain his intentions to the security personnel. \\n\u201cI said, \u2018I was trying to get this doc to Mr. Donald \u2026 will you get this to Donald?\u2019 \u201d Cary told the paper. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well dude, we\u2019d be happy to give it to him.\u2019 \u201d Trump calls black supporter a \"thug,\" has him kicked out of a rally in North Carolina. https://t.co/b4gkI6qx9v pic.twitter.com/eJKuu0CLRi \\n\u2014 Jason Sparks (@sparksjls) October 28, 2016 \\nBut it seems that this incident hasn\u2019t deterred Cary\u2019s support for \u201cMr. Donald\u201d who he described as \u201can honest person.\u201d \\n\u201cI support Trump because he\u2019s honest,\u201d Cary said . \u201cYou can work with an honest person and convince them their vision isn\u2019t in the best interest of everyone. You can\u2019t work with dishonest people. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like Obama\u2014the worst president in American history.\u201d \\nSome people never learn. \\nFeatured image via YouTube and Twitter Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562965.8572323}
