[Responding to an article published by CNN originally entitled, \u201cNancy Sinatra not happy Trump using father\u2019s song at inauguration,\u201d the    singer and actress replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I never said that. Why do you lie, CNN?\u201d   CNN\u2019s story was based on a tweet from Sinatra that has since been deleted that said, \u201cJust remember the first line of the song,\u201d in reference to the planned use of Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cMy Way\u201d for Donald and Melania Trump\u2019s first dance at the Liberty Ball on Inauguration Day. CNN has since amended the story, changing the headline to \u201cSinatra on Trump picking \u2018My Way\u2019: Remember the first line,\u201d and adding a note that \u201cThis story has been updated to reflect Sinatra\u2019s reaction. \u201d Sinatra appears to have deleted the tweet accusing CNN of lying after they updated their story\u2019s headline and text. She also congratulated the 45th president, tweeting, \u201cGood luck to you. \u201d Congratulations, Mr. President.
