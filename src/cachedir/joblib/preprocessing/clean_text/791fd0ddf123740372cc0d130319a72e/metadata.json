In a year full of pathetic spinelessness from Republicans, his efforts seem to stand out. \\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a congressman doing more damage to his lasting reputation than Chaffetz pulled off on October 26th, 2016 \u2013 a date that will live in infamy. First, news broke that Chaffetz was already prepping for a Clinton White House by pre-planning two years worth of senseless investigations in a shameless attempt to destroy any chance of her \u2013 or congress \u2013 accomplishing anything. And yet sadly that story was only half of the reason why Chaffetz singlehandedly proved Mark Twain wasn\u2019t kidding when he quipped \u201cSuppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of Congress, but then I repeat myself.\u201d Congressman Chaffetz is a very big idiot. \\nA little over one week after Chaffetz tried to score some cheap political points by unendorsing Donald Trump following the release of an audio tape in which the Republican nominee bragged about sexual assault, he sent out a tweet clarifying that when he said he wouldn\u2019t endorse or defend Trump, he never said he wouldn\u2019t vote for him. I will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump , but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad. HRC is bad for the USA. \\n\u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 27, 2016 \\nWhat\u2019s the distinction between \u201cendorsing\u201d and \u201cvoting for\u201d you ask? Well, for Jason Chaffetz it\u2019s like when you want to bake a cake but you also want to eat it too. See? Simple. Chaffetz is a very, very big idiot. \\nMaking Chaffetz\u2019s cowardice all the more apparent is the reason why he said he was unendorsing Trump in the first place. Like the rest of the country, he heard Trump\u2019s boasts about grabbing women\u2019s genitals and found it abhorrent. He also said he couldn\u2019t face his 15-year-old daughter and support a potential sexual predator like Trump. \\n\u201cI can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for president. It is some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine. My wife and I, we have a 15-year-old daughter, and if I can\u2019t look her in the eye and tell her these things, I can\u2019t endorse this person.\u201d \\nSo to be perfectly clear, Jason Chaffetz, Republican congressman from Utah, can\u2019t look his daughter in the eye and endorse Donald Trump, but he can stare her straight in the face and say \u201cDad just voted for this monster.\u201d \\nNice work, Jason. You pathetic, small man. I\u2019m forwarding your congressional photo to Webster\u2019s. \\nFeatured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742563010.140591}
