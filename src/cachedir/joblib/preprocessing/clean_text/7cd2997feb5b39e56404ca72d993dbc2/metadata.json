Basically, fascist gangs can shut down free speech. \u201d  Krauthammer said, \u201c[T]he danger here is, that we\u2019re reaching a situation where thugs are threatening violence. Basically, fascist gangs can shut down free speech. \u201d He added, \u201cIf you can\u2019t have the government guaranteeing the safety of speakers, then we have lost the  \u2014   one of the fundamental uniting elements of our society. If there\u2019s anything that unites us, it\u2019s belief in the First Amendment, belief in free speech. whenever you talk about America, what makes us unique, we believe in liberty. It begins with religious liberty, and it also begins with free speech. And if you can\u2019t get agreement on defending that, I mean, the obligation of any authority right now, is to say Ann Coulter can speak, and we will protect her. That\u2019s why you pay your taxes. That\u2019s why we have police. And we are not going to allow a gang of thugs, really fascist gangs  \u2014   this is how it started in Europe in the 20s and the 30s, fascist gangs would literally intimidate their opponents to the point where they became dominant. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to take over. This is not Mussolini. But nonetheless, it is very disturbing that in America, somebody cannot speak because there are thugs who threaten violence. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742628451.3749275}
