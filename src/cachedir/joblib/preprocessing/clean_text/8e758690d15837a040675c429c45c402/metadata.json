Instead, the address of a website will appear on the screen, giving viewers a chance to see how their story ends. \u201cI still can\u2019t even understand why it was censored,\u201d Maggie Hardy Magerko, 84 Lumber\u2019s president and owner, said in an interview this week. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m flabbergasted by that in today\u2019s day and age. It\u2019s not pornographic, it\u2019s not immoral, it\u2019s not racist. \u201d Advertisers pay millions of dollars for commercial space during the game, but the network and the National Football League maintain the right to approve any ad. \u201cWe review spots to ensure they do not violate our advertising policies,\u201d a league spokesman, Brian McCarthy, said in an email. \u201cThe ad that will air does not violate our policies. \u201d He did not say if the N. F. L. had asked for 84 Lumber\u2019s original commercial to be altered. Fox declined to comment, but the network\u2019s advertising guidelines online say that, in general, it will not sell commercial time \u201cfor viewpoint or advocacy of controversial issues. \u201d It adds that advertisers cannot use the space to address such topics. But with political tension in the country running high since the election of Mr. Trump, keeping politics completely away from the broadcast is a difficult task. Budweiser, for instance, has gained notice it wasn\u2019t anticipating for its Super Bowl ad. The commercial, which was released online this week and has passed two million views on YouTube, recounts how the brewery\u2019s   immigrated to the United States from Germany in the 1800s and notes the discrimination he overcame. Budweiser has emphasized that it is not responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown last weekend. \u201cWe believe beer should be bipartisan, and did not set out to create a piece of political commentary,\u201d Marcel Marcondes, vice president for marketing at   InBev, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we recognize that you can\u2019t reference the American dream today without being part of the conversation. \u201d In 2012, a Chrysler Super Bowl ad featuring Clint Eastwood was seen by some conservatives as pandering to President Barack Obama after his administration\u2019s bailout of automakers. In the case of 84 Lumber, Ms. Magerko said that Fox vetoed the initial idea based on a storyboard of the proposed commercial from Brunner, the company\u2019s ad agency. That document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, said the commercial would show a mother and daughter on \u201can arduous journey north,\u201d as American workers built a large structure. Their journey appeared doomed once they reached the wall until a patriotic symbol inspired them to find a massive doorway  \u2014   which is what the workers were creating all along. The final line: \u201cThe will to succeed will always be welcome here. \u201d Ms. Magerko, who said she voted for Mr. Trump, said the ad was meant to recruit employees in their 20s \u201cwho really believe in American dreams. \u201d She expressed concern about the labor shortage her company is facing. She said she had a welcoming attitude toward certain immigrants, while providing the caveat that she had faith in elected officials to \u201cmake the decisions to make us safe. \u201d \u201cI am all about those people who are willing to fight and go that extra yard to make a difference and then if they have to, you know, climb higher, go under, do whatever it takes to become a citizen. I am all for that 110 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cBut do I want cartels? Hell, no. \u201d It has become a marketing strategy of sorts over the years to intentionally create a Super Bowl ad that will never make it to air, then capitalize on online traffic. But Ms. Magerko said that was not 84 Lumber\u2019s plan, noting that the company is still showing the edited   spot that Fox has approved. Ms. Magerko said that some people might think she was \u201cas crazy as a loon to go out there and buy this enormous ad that makes no sense financially. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to have economists and all these people say she\u2019s an idiot, and maybe I am,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m an idiot that has some money now that my people made for me, and I owe it to them to say that they\u2019re great and I need more people like them. \u201d A company representative confirmed that it spent more than $5 million on the ad, which was the average rate this year for 30 seconds. The company, which draws about $2. 9 billion in revenue a year and has been rebuilding since the recession, is keen on igniting a conversation around housing and labor, she said. As for immigration and the wall, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know this was going to be the hot topic six weeks ago,\u201d Ms. Magerko said. \u201cWe knew it was a topic. We didn\u2019t know it was the topic. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628438.5681381}
