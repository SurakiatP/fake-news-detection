[Kushner is said to have discussed with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak the possibility of establishing a direct and secure conduit for communication between Moscow and Trump\u2019s transition team, established after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, the Washington Post reported on Friday.  \u201c  Trump made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U. S. officials,\u201d the Post reported. \u201cKislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications. \u201d Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, also attended the meeting, according to the Post, which cites no sources for its report except \u201cU. S. officials\u201d and \u201cpeople familiar with the matter. \u201d The White House acknowledged the meeting in March, but \u201cplayed down it\u2019s significance,\u201d the Post reported, adding that the FBI now considers the meeting  \u2014   and another with a Russian banker  \u2014   worthy of investigation. \u201cNeither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under U. S. surveillance,\u201d the Post reports that officials said. No one responded to requests for comments from the Post, including the White House, Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, and the Russian Embassy. According to the newspaper: Russia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U. S. analysts. But officials said that it\u2019s unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow, particularly at a time when the Kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with Trump. The Post\u2019s reporting adds drama to the Kushner angle of the ongoing Russian saga: Current and former U. S. intelligence officials said that although Russian diplomats have secure means of communicating with Moscow, Kushner\u2019s apparent request for access to such channels was extraordinary. \u201cHow would he trust that the Russians wouldn\u2019t leak it on their side?\u201d one former senior intelligence official said, adding that a Trump transition member going in and out of the Russian embassy would cause \u201ca great deal of concern. \u201d The entire idea, he said, \u201cseems extremely naive or absolutely crazy. \u201d \u201cIt is common for senior advisers of a newly elected president to be in contact with foreign leaders and officials,\u201d the story stated towards the end, citing U. S. intelligence\u2019s belief in an \u201cunprecedented campaign\u201d by the Russians \u201cto interfere in last year\u2019s presidential race and help elect Trump. \u201d And, the \u201cObama administration officials say members of the Trump transition team never approached them about arranging a secure communications channel with their Russian contacts, possibly because of concerns about leaks,\u201d the Post reported. And, \u201cthe State Department, the White House National Security Council and U. S. intelligence agencies all have the ability to set up secure communications channels with foreign leaders, though doing so for a transition team would be unusual. \u201d In addition, the Post reports they first heard about the Kushner meeting though an \u201canonymous letter, which said, among other things, that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. \u201d \u201cIn addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel, Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a \u2018Russian contact\u2019 in a third country whose name was not identified, according to the anonymous letter,\u201d the Post reported.'"}, "time": 1742562640.2935374}
