The conversation turned, suddenly, to activism. Chi Chi DeVayne, a sweet Louisiana queen with a thick,   accent, praised Bob the Drag Queen, a gifted, tenderhearted New York comedian, on her work in support of marriage equality. \u201cI wish that I had the guts to stand up for gay rights,\u201d she said wistfully (the contestants often use male and female pronouns interchangeably). Bob smiled and replied, \u201cGo do it, you can start anytime. \u201d Ms. DeVayne, dazzling in full makeup and a fuchsia ball gown, shook her head firmly. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it in Shreveport,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey\u2019ll blow your head off. \u201d That exchange reflected the cultural significance of \u201cDrag Race,\u201d for this particular moment in time. Queer and gay culture has been so widely   and incorporated into mainstream popular culture that it can feel commonplace, embraced by default. On the surface, that feels like a positive thing  \u2014   queer narratives, like those featured in \u201cCarol,\u201d \u201cThe Danish Girl,\u201d \u201cModern Family\u201d and \u201cTransparent\u201d go a long way toward humanizing difference. We may live in troubled times, but this visibility suggests people are finding their way. Yet, pop culture has barely started grappling with more complex and ugly contemporary narratives, ones that make clear that universal acceptance is still a fantasy  \u2014   like North Carolina\u2019s law limiting bathroom access to transgender people. This is what makes \u201cDrag Race,\u201d which airs its Season 8 finale on Monday night, so valuable. Bob and Ms. DeVayne are both 30, but they may as well be from parallel universes. They, like the show, remind viewers that these discrepancies, these gaping chasms exist. We live in a time of extreme dualities. In a recent interview with E. Alex Jung of New York magazine, RuPaul laid out the subversive function of his show. \u201cThey talk so much about acceptance now today and it\u2019s like, yes, but trust me  \u2014   I\u2019m old,\u201d he said, \u201dIt\u2019s superficial. \u201d \u201cThings haven\u2019t changed that much. You see it in politics right now,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd you know, people will have you think, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re fashion. We\u2019re gay. That\u2019s my gay over there!\u2019 It\u2019s like, no. We\u2019re still a very, very, very primitive culture. \u201d Now, more than ever, we need axes of realness to anchor and make sense of this strange world we live in. \u201cDrag Race\u201d has always been a show that knows how to balances scripted moments and genuine interactions  \u2014   by turning the shadiness and catty drama underlining the plot of almost every major reality show into a   theatrical performance, in which contestants earn points for the ability to mock one another. Drag lives to be weird, to mock conformity, and pokes hole in the artifice of normativity, exposing the notion of fixed identity and gender as an inherently flawed premise. \u201cDrag Race,\u201d which in every episode asks competitors to construct new identities and costumes, lives to point out that our meat suits can be altered, that anyone can paint and sew a new persona, that all appearances are illusions anyway. Last season, the show almost deflated that premise. Season 7 was dominated by two contestants, Violet Chachki and Pearl, who both shimmered on the surface, but didn\u2019t seem to have much depth below, at least, none that they were willing to reveal. Phenomenally talented, and already Instagram famous before their first appearance on the show, they were willowy and   exceptionally gifted at pulling off classically \u201cfishy\u201d looks, which in drag slang means feminine to the point of passing. They won competition after competition, and praise from the judges. \u201cDrag Race\u201d no longer seemed to exist to expose the performance of hyperfemininity, it seemed to cultivate it. The preference for heteronormative standards of beauty was tremendously disappointing. But this season rebounded from that. One of the earliest and most severe eliminations was a pageant queen. And two of the season\u2019s stronger contestants had male drag names. Weirdness reigned, through strong performances by Acid Betty, with her psychedelic palette, and the transformations of Thorgy Thor, a hippie with dreads and round glasses who invented a new character during every challenge. Kim Chi, one of the show\u2019s first breakout   contestants, constructed some of the most sophisticated looks to grace RuPaul\u2019s stage, a combination of flora and fauna and dessert pastry. Charming and chubby, with a lisp, his most revealing moment came when he tearfully revealed that he has hidden his exquisite talents at makeup and costume design from his own mother, for fear she will be repulsed by his love of drag. In another, he confessed that he was a virgin. Moments like that, both shocking and sad, affirmed the importance of \u201cDrag Race,\u201d the rare space on television that relishes honesty and exploration, that doesn\u2019t subscribe to the notion that all is well now that we live in a    world. At its best, drag exposes the charade of modern life, the idea that there are set rules to follow, and even if there are, that you can win by following them. Personality, growth, the ability to evolve and, really, to survive, were the traits that the judges prioritized this season. But, you wonder, how can the show itself grow and evolve from here? At this point in its life cycle, RuPaul\u2019s universe has expanded so much that a generation has been weaned on the show and its spinoffs, like \u201cRuPaul Drag U. \u201d \u201cDrag Race\u201d is its own feedback loop, its own perpetual motion machine. It\u2019s as mainstream as a show about drag can get. At the same time, \u201cDrag Race\u201d flourishes in cultlike purgatory. Even the show\u2019s network, Logo TV, aimed at the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender audience, is squirreled away, available only to cable subscribers. Without streaming services like iTunes and Amazon Prime, \u201cDrag Race\u201d might not have the fandom and staying power that it currently does. That won\u2019t matter much on Monday night, when the finale is aired. It\u2019s not yet clear who will win. In the    episode, after the group trooped back out to hear the verdict, RuPaul informed Ms. DeVayne that she would not advance to the final round and win the $100, 000 or the title. She seemed unsurprised, and smiled. \u201cYou have taught me how to be a better person,\u201d she said, about loving who she is and where she is from. \u201cAnd $100, 000 can\u2019t buy that. \u201d At that, Ms. DeVayne snapped her fingers so clear and loud it almost sounded like a bell, before sashaying away.'"}, "time": 1742628378.7867463}
