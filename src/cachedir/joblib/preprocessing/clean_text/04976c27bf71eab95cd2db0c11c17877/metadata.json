Krauthammer dismissed the controversy and noted the timing of the allegations of the effort to open communications, which are said to have happened during the transition and not the campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t trust this story,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cThe Russians are leaking it clearly on a channel they know we\u2019re going to pick up. The Russians are masters of disinformation. They already have Washington with its knickers in a twist with a Russian conspiracy. This is an added twist. Somebody\u2019s going to get a hernia here. I think I\u2019ll stop the metaphor with that point. But we have no idea if it\u2019s true. Let\u2019s say it is true. Isn\u2019t the problem here, the accusation here that there was some collusion during the campaign with the Russians? Well, everyone agrees if the story is true, it occurred after the campaign during the transition. So, unless there\u2019s some sort of nefarious connection here, there\u2019s no connection to what was alleged to have happened during the campaign. \u201d \u201cAnd lastly, we\u2019ve had backchannel connections with adversaries for generations,\u201d he added. \u201cHenry Kissinger had them with the Russians and the Chinese. Hillary had a backchannel to establish the opening with the Iranians in what ended up as the opening in what ended up as the Iranian nuclear deal   \u2026     This happens all the time. I don\u2019t quite understand where is the crime other than it is another piece that has Russia in the headline, Trump people in the headline and thus, it is supposed to be scandalous.
