Try doing what The New York Times did: writing a story about a bunch of fathers in Montclair, N. J. who had to endure the hardship of watching their children for a day while their wives attended protest marches in Washington and New York. \u201cIn their wake,\u201d the story said, \u201cthey left behind a progressive bedroom community with suddenly skewed demographics. Routines were radically altered, and many fathers tried to meet weekend demands alone for a change. \u201d Poor daddies. Poor kids. The headline on the home page didn\u2019t help matters: \u201cWhen \u2018Mommy Has to March,\u2019 Routines Shift. \u201d Ouch. The headline on the story was this: \u201cHow Vital Are Women? This Town Found Out as They Left to March. \u201d As you might imagine, the story rubbed more than a few readers the wrong way. Hannah Laurison of Philadelphia had this to say: And here\u2019s Jessica Wilbanks from Houston: \u201cThere is so much wrong with this piece that it\u2019s hard to know where to start. How is it a hardship that wealthy men in a privileged community are taking care of their own offspring for less than 24 hours?\u201d Not to be left out, people chimed in on Twitter, including this dad: The Huffington Post beat me to my job with a good piece on the matter that it posted this afternoon. Check it out here. There is pretty much nothing about this piece that I think was wisely considered, for all the reasons readers already articulated. The staff produced some strong, readable coverage of the march in New York, but this wasn\u2019t among it. Here\u2019s the silver lining, and the part I found exhilarating. The Metro editor, Wendell Jamieson, whose section produced the piece, unequivocally acknowledged that it was a mistake. \u201cIt was a bad idea from the \u201d Jamieson said. \u201cIt was conceived with the best intentions, but it fell flat. And I regret it. \u201d Classy. Needless to say, I agree.'"}, "time": 1742628545.3943038}
