By 2017 no human will ever attend a gig again.\u201d \\nNathan Muir, from Colchester, said: \u201cI was sat behind one of these bots for Paul Simon at the Royal Albert Hall. Just a few lines of cleverly written code, but you could tell it was into it. \\n\u201cThough there was a twatty one on the balcony that kept shouting \u2018Free Bird\u2019, apparently because its code had been corrupted.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742562158.4365582}
