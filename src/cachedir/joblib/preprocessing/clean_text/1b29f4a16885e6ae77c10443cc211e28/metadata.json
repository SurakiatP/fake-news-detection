He also appeared next to her during the DNC and supported his party opponent in the Democratic campaigns. \\nOn July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton after facing mounting pressure from major Democratic figures, including outgoing US President Barack Obama himself.

His comments include a call to ban all Muslims from coming to America as well as stopping Mexican migrants by building a long wall along the US-Mexico border. \\nHe has also sought for a database to track Muslims across the United States and said that the US would have \"absolutely no choice\" but to close down mosques. \\nTrump\u2019s proposal was widely condemned by Muslim and human rights groups as well as his Democratic rivals and many of his Republican proponents who describe the proposal as divisive, counterproductive and contrary to American values.
