[The new program was unveiled at a Chicago City Council meeting on Wednesday, and it protects illegal aliens from federal oversight by not collecting any copies of identification documents presented when illegals apply for the identification card.  \u201cApplicants bring in the documents to prove someone\u2019s identity. They hand them over to specially trained individual who can review the documents and then hand them back   \u2026     It\u2019s going to capture just the name and the date of birth. It\u2019s not going to capture an address,\u201d a source close to those officials told the Chicago  . Emanuel, once President Barack Obama\u2019s Chief of Staff, has been one of the loudest voices decrying Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s efforts to cut off federal funding for sanctuary cities like Chicago that refuse to cooperate in the enforcement of immigration laws. The \u201cMunicipal ID\u201d plan is Emanuel\u2019s latest bid to resist the effort of the Justice Department and remain what he has called a \u201cwelcoming city. \u201d Emanuel\u2019s new City Clerk Anna Valencia\u2019s website describes the Municipal ID as \u201can optional, valid,   ID that they can then use to access a range of services from both the private and public sectors. \u201d In addition to ensuring access for illegals to government programs, the Clerk\u2019s Office also claims to be \u201cworking with cultural institutions, sports teams, pharmacies, local chambers of commerce and community organizations to explore potential discounts and partnerships. \u201d The scheme is specifically designed not only to allow illegals to obtain the cards, but to avoid collecting data that could be used by U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to discover aliens in the country illegally. Chicago is apparently looking to a model pioneered in San Francisco to frustrate ICE efforts. \u201cApplicants bring in the documents to prove someone\u2019s identity.

It\u2019s not going to capture an address,\u201d a source close to those officials told the Chicago  . While city officials will make no effort to ascertain if recipients of the new ID are committing a crime by being in the United States, they will ensure that the gender with which they most strongly identify will be properly documented. \u201cApplicants will also be able to   their gender, which will be huge to the transgender and LGBTQ community. And it\u2019s not just for undocumented individuals,\u201d the same source said. The   also reported that the Municipal ID program itself will cost Chicago taxpayers $1 million in its first year of implementation.'"}, "time": 1742564016.4238172}
