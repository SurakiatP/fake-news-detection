The restaurant\u2019s owner, John Ramsey, surreptitiously watched as Muhammad Ali flirted shamelessly with the pretty woman, who six years earlier had become his fourth wife. On that day in 1992, Ramsey learned all he needed to know about Lonnie Ali by observing the effect she had on his longtime friend. \u201cHe was trying to kiss her on the cheek, and she was blushing and trying to pull away, and he was pulling her close and whispering in her ear,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cIt warmed my heart. I had never seen him in that capacity. I saw a side of Muhammad Ali that wasn\u2019t the fighter, that wasn\u2019t the humanitarian, that was the guy in love with the girl. \u201d Ali\u2019s death last Friday at age 74, after a long battle with Parkinson\u2019s disease, has stirred a weeklong retrospective on a life spent fighting for championship belts and charitable and civil causes. During his public funeral in Louisville on Friday, the spotlight will shift, however briefly, to Lonnie, 59, one of several speakers who will deliver eulogies. Few people can offer a better, or broader, perspective of the sweep of Ali\u2019s life than the former Yolanda Williams, known as Lonnie, who met him as a pigtailed first grader in Louisville, their hometown, and grew up to become Ali\u2019s caregiver and keeper of his legacy. In their 30 years of marriage, friends said in interviews, Lonnie was a doting wife but also a   M. B. A. who managed Ali\u2019s affairs with steely determination. She protected Ali\u2019s health and wealth, both of which were in sharp decline when they married. Friends said that, by all indications, the couple enjoyed a deep bond. They managed to avoid the harsh tabloid parsing of their marriage common among celebrities. Lonnie was a hometown girl, but worldly enough to know that Ali\u2019s fame called for foreign dignitaries like President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and King Abdullah II of Jordan to take part in the funeral. \u201cShe took care of his every need,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI used to tell Muhammad, \u2018If reincarnation is true, I want to come back as you,\u2019 because Lonnie spoiled him rotten. And her affections never wavered. She stuck by him through everything. \u201d Those who were close to them said that in Lonnie, Ali found a partner who matched his wit and far exceeded his ability to recognize freeloaders and ne\u2019  . Jimmy Walker, a philanthropist based in Phoenix who also runs an estate planning and executive benefits business, described her as \u201cthe perfect wife for the most recognized man in the world. \u201d \u201cDue to Muhammad\u2019s health situation, in order to protect him, I am sure she has had to say no many times, which hasn\u2019t always been popular among some people that didn\u2019t quite understand,\u201d Walker said. She \u201cprotected Muhammad from people who didn\u2019t have his best interests at heart,\u201d he added, and repeated a line uttered by the photographer Howard Bingham, a longtime Ali confidant: \u201cLonnie took names and kicked butt. \u201d Last Friday evening, less than two hours after Ali died of septic shock in a hospital in the Phoenix area, Walker and his wife visited Lonnie at the home she shared with Ali in a gated community in a Phoenix suburb. Walker said they found her sitting in the   power reclining chair where in recent years Ali whiled away his days watching CNN, VH1 and tapes of his championship fights. Lonnie, he said, was staring at the television, tuned to CNN\u2019s coverage of her husband\u2019s death. Her sister Marilyn, who helped care for Ali, and Asaad, her adopted son with Ali who played baseball at Louisville and is the assistant baseball coach at Ellsworth Community College in Iowa Falls, were also there. Though she had helped Ali prepare detailed instructions for his funeral several years ago, Lonnie was still staggered by his death. Walker said Lonnie greeted him at the house by saying softly, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. \u201d Ali was bursting with life the first time Lonnie met him. It was 1963 and her family had recently moved to the Montclair Villa subdivision in Louisville. Their house on Verona Way was across from the place that Ali bought for his parents, Odessa and Cassius Marcellus Clay, after he won a boxing gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional. Lonnie\u2019s mother, Marguerite Williams, became friends with Ali\u2019s mother, accompanying her over the years to many of Ali\u2019s championship fights. Anytime Ali came to visit Odessa, he would always stay to play with the neighborhood children. During one such visit, Ali, then 21, was introduced to the    Lonnie. In a 2012 interview with The New York Times Magazine, she recalled that she was \u201cscared to death\u201d and hid behind her mother\u2019s dress. Lonnie quickly warmed to Ali, their friends said. Rhonda K. Richardson, a lawyer who grew up near Lonnie and has been friends with her for more than 50 years, said the Williamses\u2019 house was the neighborhood\u2019s social center. \u201cHer mother was very nurturing,\u201d said Richardson, who salivates at the memory of Marguerite\u2019s cherry delight, a dessert that was similar to cheesecake, only more tart. \u201cI lived more there than at my house,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of household it was. \u201d Richardson remembered going to the Williamses\u2019 dinner table and seeing Ali already seated. \u201cHe was just a part of her family,\u201d she said. Over the years, she recalled each of Ali\u2019s wives joining him at the table. He married Sonji Roi in 1964 Belinda Boyd, with whom he had four children, in 1967 and Veronica Porche, with whom he had two children, in 1977. He also had two children by different women outside his marriages. As Lonnie navigated adolescence, Ali was like another big brother to her, dispensing advice that included never getting romantically involved with athletes because they wouldn\u2019t treat her well. \u201cWe were all enchanted with Muhammad,\u201d Richardson said, \u201cbut as we got older, that enchantment turned into something deeper for Lonnie. I think Muhammad is probably the only man that Lonnie has ever loved. \u201d At 17, Lonnie had an epiphany. \u201cI knew I was going to marry Muhammad,\u201d she said in the 2012 New York Times Magazine article. \u201cI was just a kid in school, and I had things I needed to do, but I knew. I was young, but it was intuitive. The thought was like an umbrella, always over my head. \u201d Lonnie earned an undergraduate degree in psychology at Vanderbilt in 1978. She served briefly as an employment counselor for the State of Kentucky before taking a job in account sales with Kraft Foods. In 1982, she was invited to lunch by Ali during one of his visits to Louisville. Two years had passed since his   defeat to Larry Holmes in a bout that the actor Sylvester Stallone later described as \u201clike watching an autopsy on a man who\u2019s still alive. \u201d The meal left a bad taste with Lonnie, who was alarmed by Ali\u2019s condition. He appeared to be depressed and was in poor physical condition. In his 2009 book, \u201cMuhammad Ali: The Making of an Icon,\u201d Michael Ezra wrote that Lonnie agreed to move to Los Angeles to become Ali\u2019s primary caregiver in return for Ali paying for her to attend graduate school at U. C. L. A. an arrangement that he said had the approval of Ali\u2019s wife at the time, Porche. Her intervention revived Ali and his fortunes, said Dave Kindred, who covered Ali for The Louisville   The Atlanta   and The Washington Post and wrote a book, \u201cSound and Fury,\u201d about the unlikely friendship between Ali and the sportscaster Howard Cosell. \u201cI think Ali would have been gone and forgotten 30 years ago, if not for Lonnie,\u201d he said. Ali had holed himself up in his Los Angeles mansion and was a recluse in dire need of medical and financial attention, Kindred explained. \u201cShe took care of him and created a financial empire for him that made it possible for him to have a comfortable life,\u201d he said. In November 1986, Lonnie accompanied Ali to Louisville. She had completed her master\u2019s in business administration, with an emphasis in marketing, at U. C. L. A, and Ali had obtained his divorce from Porche. Lonnie, raised a Catholic, had also converted to Islam. At a   with Richardson, Lonnie casually dropped a bombshell. As Richardson recalled, \u201cShe said, \u2018I think Muhammad and I are going to get married when we get back to L. A.\u2019\u201d The shock wasn\u2019t that they were getting married. \u201cEveryone could see they were two peas in a pod,\u201d Richardson said. And, she said, there was the conversation with Ali in which he acknowledged Lonnie \u201cbeing the right one. \u201d But holding the ceremony in Los Angeles? \u201cI told her: \u2018No way! Absolutely not! You\u2019re going to get married here,\u2019\u201d said Richardson, who helped Lonnie organize a civil ceremony. On Nov. 19, 1986, in front of a small gathering, Lonnie, 29, and Ali, 44, were married in the private home of a former mayor of Louisville, Harvey Sloane, then the Jefferson County   who officiated. \u201cMuhammad was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s right around the time they were married,\u201d Richardson said, \u201cand the No. 1 priority in Lonnie\u2019s life over the years has been taking care of him. \u201d In 1992, Lonnie incorporated Greatest of All Time, Inc. (G. O. A. T. Inc) to consolidate and license Ali\u2019s intellectual properties for commercial purposes and served as the vice president and treasurer until the sale of the company in 2006. In 2005, she and her husband founded the multicultural Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville. It was Lonnie who leaned on Ali to become the face of Parkinson\u2019s. The idea came from Dr. Abraham Lieberman, who said he started treating Ali for the disease in the 1980s. He traveled to the couple\u2019s summer home in Michigan and delivered his pitch. Lieberman said Ali\u2019s initial response was, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the poster boy for Parkinson\u2019s. \u201d He added, \u201cMuhammad was afraid he was getting old because he saw Parkinson\u2019s as an  \u2019s disease. \u201d Upon his return to Phoenix, Lieberman received a call from Ali, who had reconsidered. He told Lieberman to write him a pitch, and Lieberman crafted it as a poem, which he said won Ali over. But before the poem, there was Lonnie\u2019s gentle persuasion. \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t there he probably would have said no, and that would have been the end of it,\u201d Lieberman said. Lieberman said that in recent years he visited Ali at his home every other week to check on him. \u201cThere were always people in the house,\u201d Lieberman said, painting a picture that calls to mind the warm and welcoming environment that Lonnie\u2019s mother had nurtured on Verona Way. Ramsey, who will serve as a pallbearer at Friday\u2019s funeral, spent time in the hospital with Asaad, Marilyn, Lonnie and her stepchildren last week as Ali\u2019s condition worsened. Four days after Ali\u2019s death, Ramsey, 55, said, \u201cLonnie balanced Ali because he loved the spotlight and she never looked for it. \u201d He added: \u201cShe used to say, \u2018He belongs to the world.\u2019 She embraced that. \u201d It has been hard to let go. Ramsey said Lonnie told him this week, \u201cJohn, when I get sad and think I\u2019m going to cry, I hear Muhammad\u2019s voice saying: \u2018Stand up. Hold your head up high. Don\u2019t cry.\u2019 And it helps me. \u201d Ramsey added: \u201cIt\u2019s the end of a great love story. Who does recover from that? But she does have that Muhammad DNA. She gets off the mat. She\u2019s strong to the core. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563964.1167412}
