Politically outspoken celebrities including Katy Perry, Amy Schumer, John Legend, George Takei, and Mark Ruffalo all tweeted about the bill, while TV personality Andy Richter called House Republicans \u201csoulless pimps\u201d and comedian Patton Oswalt vowed to make the 2018 midterm election a \u201c   nightmare for the GOP. \u201d \u201cThe American people are coming for all of you,\u201d tweeted Beauty and the Beast star Josh Gad.
