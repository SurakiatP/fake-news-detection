For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:\u201d Romans 13:1-3 (KJV) \\nThis is what the Southern Poverty Law Center says about themselves on thier own website: \u201cThe SPLC is the premier U.S. non-profit organization monitoring the activities of domestic hate groups and other extremists \u2013 including the Ku Klux Klan , the neo-Nazi movement, neo-Confederates , racist skinheads , black separatists , antigovernment militias , Christian Identity adherents and others.\u201d \\nSo it was with great amusement that I saw on page 60 of their yearly \u201c The Year In Hate And Extremism \u201d where they provide a state-by-state listing of anti government groups, Now The End Begins was included in their assessment of Florida. Hmmm\u2026is NTEB really an \u201canti government\u201d group? \\nNo, we are not. My father was a vet of both WWII and Korea, my brother a US Marine, and I have lots of friends who are warfighters, police officers and first responders. I was raised to have a deep and abiding respect for the police and government officials. I have never advocated for any uprising against our government, and certainly never advocated for violence on any level. That being said, NTEB is in 100% agreement with the following statement by founding father Thomas Jefferson: \\n\u201cThat whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\u201d \u2013 Declaration of Independence \\nNTEB has been very hard on the Obama administration for reasons listed here , here and here . As well as here , here and here . And here . And oh, here , here and here , too. Ugh, enough already! A short Compilation of Barack Obama\u2019s blatant lies: \\nNow The End Begins is not \u201cagainst government\u201d , but we are against bad government, oppressiv e government, corrupt government and anti-American government. The Obama administration has been an 8 year experiment in white guilt, unvetted illegal immigration and a doubling of the National Debt just to name a few. Barack Obama is the anti-Reagan, a global citizen and the \u201c president of the world .\u201d That\u2019s not good government for America, that\u2019s slop created for Socialists, Liberals and Communists by true anti-government troublemakers like Saul Alinsky . That\u2019s not us, not by a long shot. Donald Trump: \u201cMy policy is America first\u201d \\nIn 2016, America is presented with a fantastic opportunity to elect as leader, not a politician, but a businessman whose platform is simple. Put America first , and work to restore our former greatness. Wow, that\u2019s exactly right. That\u2019s a government that I can wholeheartedly support. That\u2019s a government that the founding fathers would support. \\nIt\u2019s time to Make America Great Again. \\n '"}, "time": 1742628320.2077334}
