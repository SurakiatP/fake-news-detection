Just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\u201d\\nHealthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn\\'t feel good and changes \u2013 AUTISM. Many such cases!\\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2014 \\n\\nDuring a GOP a primary debate with Trump, Dr. Ben Carson claimed there is no \u201cdocumented proof\u201d that vaccines are responsible for autism, however Dr. Carson, a neuroscientist, conceded that \u201cit is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.\u201d\\n\" @P01YN0NYM0U55 : @jamandatrtl #vaccines #Shills insist #Autism starts in utero or genetic, but parents insist sudden onset after #vaccine \"\\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2014 \\n\\nTrump\u2019s response echoes one he gave on Fox News in April 2012, in which he also related the story of a child of one of his employees who was damaged after receiving vaccines.\\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten to be pretty familiar with the subject,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 Fox & Friends. \u201cYou know, I have a theory \u2014 and it\u2019s a theory that some people believe in \u2014 and that\u2019s the vaccinations. We never had anything like this.\\n\u201cThis is now an epidemic. It\u2019s way, way up over the past 10 years. It\u2019s way up over the past two years. And, you know, when you take a little baby that weighs like 12 pounds into a doctor\u2019s office and they pump them with many, many simultaneous vaccinations \u2014 I\u2019m all for vaccinations, but I think when you add all of these vaccinations together and then two months later the baby is so different then lots of different things have happened. I really \u2014 I\u2019ve known cases.\u201d\\nThe vaccine autism link recently came under federal scrutiny when Florida US Congressman Bill Posey noted before a House committee the testimony of Center for Disease Control whistle-blower Bill Thompson, who claimed the agency colluded with researchers to destroy documents linking the injection to thousands of autism cases.\\nI am being proven right about massive vaccinations\u2014the doctors lied. Save our children & their future.\\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2014 \\n\\nOn July 29, US Congressman Bill Posey made his last stand on the floor of the House. Granted five minutes to speak, he exposed lies by the CDC in the infamous 2004 study that exonerated the MMR vaccine and claimed it had no connection to autism.\\n\u201cNo connection to autism\u201d was the lie. Congressman Posey read a statement by long-term CDC researcher William Thompson, one of the authors of the 2004 Pediatrics study designed to determine once and for all if the MMR vaccine has contributed to the autism epidemic.\\n\u201c\u2026the [CDC] co-authors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the [MMR vaccine] study. The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage can.\u201d\\nWith Trump in the White House with full executive powers the vaccine autism link is about to come under it\u2019s most severe scrutiny yet.\\n \\n'"}, "time": 1742628443.8568933}
