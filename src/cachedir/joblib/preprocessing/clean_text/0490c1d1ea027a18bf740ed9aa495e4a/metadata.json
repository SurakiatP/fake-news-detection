Bannon marginalized? Is Jared Kushner leading the president into strange and unusual places? Is Reince, and is Sean Spicer, influential? Are they on their way out? In your opinion, what is going on here, what do we need to be wary of, what are we looking out for, who are the players, and how do they align with each other?\u201d Kassam asked.  \u201cSince inauguration, it was really about four camps,\u201d Ryun replied. \u201cIt was the Kushner camp, it was the Bannon camp, it was the Reince camp, and it was the Pence camp. But I\u2019m starting to think, based off what I was hearing from yesterday and then reading reports this morning, that this is becoming actually more of two camps  \u2014   that it really is the national populists, really led by Bannon, versus, quite frankly  \u2014   there\u2019s no other way to describe them  \u2014   the liberal New York City set that have come in. \u201d Ryun said the latter camp included \u201cGary Cohn, Dina Powell,\u201d and others he described as Democrats, along with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. \u201cGod bless them, they\u2019re part of the Trump family, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves: they are part of the Manhattan liberal set,\u201d he said of the latter duo.  \u201cThe question that I have as I\u2019m reading these reports  \u2014   and I think we should start asking questions  \u2014   who are they really? What has been their experience? What is their worldview? Because I\u2019m starting to suspect their worldview does not line up with the campaign promises that Trump was making,\u201d Ryun said. \u201cThe people that voted for Donald Trump voted for very specific things,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey do want to see a wall. They want to see immigration dealt with. They want to see healthcare reform. They want to see tax reform. They want to see all of these things. \u201d \u201cWatching what\u2019s taking place, I\u2019m growing more and more concerned that some of the dynamics, some of the voices in Trump\u2019s ear, some of the influences  \u2014   we should start asking questions. Are they starting to steer him in the wrong direction, away from what got him into one of the most stunning victories in presidential history, got him into the White House?\u201d Ryun asked. Kassam returned to Ryun\u2019s description of the \u201cliberal New York City set\u201d and asked him to explain the importance of Dina Powell. Ryun noted Powell is a fellow veteran of the Bush White House. \u201cI was at the White House before she was, but she came in she was head of presidential personnel. In fact, I think she was the   head of presidential personnel,\u201d he said. He continued that after Powell left the Bush White House, she worked for Goldman Sachs in New York \u201cand now has come back, really gotten involved with Ivanka Trump   Day. \u201d \u201cI have real concerns, not only about the New York liberal set that has come into the White House.   \u2026     I am more and more concerned about the Goldman Sachs people that have come into the administration,\u201d Ryun professed.  He said they have a \u201cdifferent worldview than the American people that voted Trump in. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got that worldview, you\u2019ve got the New York Goldman Sachs liberal set worldview, and the real question here is which one is going to win out, influencing the future direction of Trump,\u201d he predicted. \u201cI thought really yesterday, at first, initially, it was a reorganization by McMaster of some of these things,\u201d Ryun said of the news that Steve Bannon has been removed from the principals committee of the National Security Council. \u201cI\u2019m a little more concerned that there is a serious power struggle going on. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, my hope is that Trump will say, \u2018I know what got me in. I know what brought me to the White House. Steve Bannon is really the lead cheerleader on that front. Keep Steve close. Listen to Steve. Keep pushing down this path,\u201d Ryun advised. \u201cIf he does, there will be victory this year in regards to policy,\u201d he anticipated. \u201cHe\u2019s already going to have it this week with Gorsuch. I really do think we\u2019re going to get something done with health care. There\u2019s going to be a massive step in the right direction. I do think we\u2019ve got a real shot at tax reform. \u201d \u201cYou get a couple of these victories under your belt. You keep going down this path. Then we\u2019re going to start talking about what the second Trump term looks like,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if he starts to stray, I\u2019m concerned. \u201d Kassam asked where the Republican National Committee, its former chairman Reince Priebus, and Sean Spicer fit into this picture. \u201cYou know, I think they\u2019re starting to realize that the New York set, they\u2019re not their friends,\u201d Ryun replied. \u201cI think in a weird strange alliance that the RNC folks are realizing they\u2019re basically going to become allies with Bannon. \u201d \u201cThis is all on the fly. This is all really the last 24 hours,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the other guys win, I guarantee you Bannon\u2019s out, Reince is out, Spicer\u2019s out, the corporate New York set is in. \u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see, internally, really kind of what I think are strange alliances. But in the short term, I think they\u2019re going to be working together to push back on this New York set. Quite frankly, even though it pains me somewhat to say this, I hope that Bannon and the RNC guys, that alliance is successful,\u201d Ryun said.
