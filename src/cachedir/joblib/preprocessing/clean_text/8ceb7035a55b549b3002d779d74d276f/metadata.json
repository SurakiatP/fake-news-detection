[Ubisoft\u2019s 3rd quarter was as much a mixed bag of victory and defeat. While winter sports sim Steep outperformed its relatively muted expectations,   simulator Watch Dogs 2 wasn\u2019t quite as \u201cdynamic\u201d as the company expected with a \u201csoft\u201d launch. Still, it reportedly managed to outperform last year\u2019s shaky Assassin\u2019s Creed: Syndicate launch.  While interest in MMO shooter The Division has dwindled since its blockbuster release, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot did report a 152% jump in active players since the game\u2019s big October update. Meanwhile, tactical multiplayer shooter Rainbow Six: Siege is healthier than ever, with over 15 million registered players and the highest daily activity yet in a community that continues to expand. Moreover, back catalog games like the aforementioned The Division and Rainbow Six: Siege are driving profits further than usual. Ubisoft\u2019s continued support of their older titles is paying off, and the lack of a 2016 entry in the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise seems to have boosted the sales of previous games in the series. Guillemot said that Ubisoft is \u201csuccessfully pursuing our transformation into a more recurring and more profitable profile\u201d and that \u201cthe positive effects of this transformation are remarkable. \u201d Finally, Ubisoft reported about $213 million for the Assassin\u2019s Creed movie, a \u201csolid first step. \u201d While it didn\u2019t exactly wow the critics, gamers around the world seem to have enjoyed seeing the titular Assassins struggle against the machinations of Abstergo\u2019s Templars on the big screen. Ubisoft will be releasing the next major entry this year in the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise and has delayed South Park: The Fractured But Hole into fiscal year 2017, which could help improve their fortunes over last year.
