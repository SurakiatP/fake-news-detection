S. is working on securing her husband\u2019s release. [The American Center for Law and Justice, which is lobbying for Brunson, reported the letter from Pence comes on the heels of a meeting just days ago between Norine and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during his recent diplomatic trip to Turkey.  \u201cOn the heels of Pastor Andrew Brunson\u2019s wife personal meeting with U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson concerning the wrongful imprisonment of her husband, she received a personal letter from Vice President Pence assuring her that Brunson\u2019s \u2018case remains a top priority of the U. S. government,\u2019\u201d ACLJ reported. Citing his \u201cdeep, personal interest\u201d over Brunson\u2019s plight, Pence wrote: \u201cI can assure you both that the State Department and this White House, under President Trump\u2019s leadership, consider Andrew\u2019s release and reunification with you and your three children extremely important. \u201d Pence also said that he had \u201cpersonally discussed [Pastor Andrew\u2019s] detention with senior Turkish officials,\u201d according to ACLJ. Brunson and his wife have lived as Christian missionaries in Turkey for more than 20 years and raised their children there. Now, his family is suffering the loss of their beloved husband, father, and brother. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard on us as his family,\u201d Beth Herman, Brunson\u2019s sister, told Breitbart News. \u201cWe love him and we want him to be back with his family. \u201d \u201cWe really, really want to get this case, my father\u2019s case, to President Trump,\u201d Brunson\u2019s daughter Jacqueline Brunson told Fox News in a recent interview. Jacqueline Brunson, a college student, told   she\u2019s has put her wedding plans on hold, Faithwire. com reported. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of on hold because I want my dad to be able to walk me down the aisle,\u201d she said. \u201cI want him there. He only gets to see me get married once. \u201d Brunson made a direct appeal to Trump in a statement he gave to officials at the U. S. Embassy in Turkey: Will the Turkish government face no consequence for stubbornly continuing to hold an American citizen as a political prisoner?  Even though I have a long public track record as a church pastor, they falsely accuse me of being a member of an Islamist terrorist group. I have been imprisoned since October 7, 2016. During this time the Turkish government has produced no proof and has rebuffed numerous attempts by the American government to secure my return to the United States. In fact they are treating the US government with contempt and paying no price for it. I plead with my government  \u2014   with the Trump Administration  \u2014   to fight for me. I ask the State Department to impose sanctions. I appeal to President Trump: please help me. Let the Turkish government know that you will not cooperate with them in any way until they release me. Please do not leave me here in prison. ACLJ also launched a petition drive, which 261, 383 people have signed, to show their support for Brunson and to ask for his release and return to the United States. \u201cWe have a strong faith in God,\u201d Brunson\u2019s sister said. \u201cWe believe God is with him and he\u2019ll make it through this. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563978.165565}
