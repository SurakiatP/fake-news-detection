He was unhappy with reporting in The New York Times, and he had a solution. \u201cChange libel laws?\u201d he asked. On the campaign trail, where he was not constrained by Twitter\u2019s character limit, Mr. Trump was more expansive. \u201cI\u2019m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\u2019re totally protected. \u201d It is indeed hard for public figures to win libel suits. They have to prove that something false was said about them, that it harmed their reputation and that the writer acted with \u201cactual malice. \u201d That last term is misleading, as it has nothing to do with the ordinary meaning of malice in the sense of spite or ill will. To prove actual malice, a libel plaintiff must show that the writer knew the disputed statement was false or had acted with \u201creckless disregard. \u201d That second phrase is also a term of art. The Supreme Court has said that it requires proof that the writer entertained serious doubts about the truth of the statement. That is a high bar, and public figures rarely file libel suits and seldom win them. No. Libel law is a   tort, meaning that state courts and state legislatures have defined its contours. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court has placed constitutional limits on how states can define libel, notably by requiring public officials and, later, public figures to prove actual malice. That protection was needed, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote, to vindicate a \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and  . \u201d Such debate, Justice Brennan wrote, \u201cmay well include vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials. \u201d Changing New York Times v. Sullivan would require either the Supreme Court to overrule it or a constitutional amendment. Neither is remotely likely, though Mr. Trump could try to appoint Supreme Court justices who would vote to overturn the precedent. Last week, at his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch was asked about New York Times v. Sullivan by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. She wanted to know whether \u201cthe First Amendment would permit public officials to sue the media under any standard less demanding than actual malice?\u201d Judge Gorsuch, cagey when asked about other precedents, seemed comfortable with this. \u201cNew York Times v. Sullivan was, as you say, a landmark decision and it changed pretty dramatically the law of defamation and libel in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than the common law of defamation and libel, applicable normally for a long time, the Supreme Court said the First Amendment has special meaning and protection when we\u2019re talking about the media, the press in covering public officials, public actions and indicated that a higher standard of proof was required in any defamation or libel claim. Proof of actual malice is required to state a claim. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s been the law of the land for, gosh, 50, 60 years. \u201d Beyond the actual malice rule, Mr. Trump would have to prove injury to his reputation. As Judge Gorsuch put it in a 2011 opinion, libel law is \u201cabout protecting a good reputation honestly earned. \u201d The state of Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation arose during the presidential campaign, when his lawyers asked for a retraction of an article in The Times that reported on complaints from two women who said Mr. Trump had touched them inappropriately. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers called the article libelous and seemed to threaten to sue. David McCraw, a lawyer for The Times, responded that Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation was too tarnished to allow a successful libel suit. \u201cThe essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one\u2019s reputation,\u201d Mr. McCraw wrote. But Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation in this area, Mr. McCraw said, could not have been harmed by The Times\u2019s report in light of, for instance, Mr. Trump\u2019s own statements about groping women. \u201cNothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself,\u201d Mr. McCraw wrote. So far, there has been no lawsuit filed over the article. \u201cWe continue to be extremely proud of our coverage of the Trump administration, which has been tough and fair, as it should be,\u201d said Eileen Murphy, a Times spokeswoman.'"}, "time": 1742562620.351265}
