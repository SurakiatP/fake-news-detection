[The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said it had appointed Mardini as its newest Goodwill Ambassador, a role long famously held by US movie star Angelina Jolie.  Mardini \u201chas become a powerful voice for the forcibly displaced across the world and a powerful example of their resilience and determination to rebuild lives and positively contribute to host communities,\u201d UNHCR said in a statement. The   \u2019s story is indeed inspiring. In 2015, like millions of others, she fled her home in   Syria. During a perilous journey to the Greek island of Lesbos on board a packed dinghy, the engine failed and the craft began taking on water. Mardini and her sister jumped into the sea, grabbed a rope and spent the next     hours in the choppy water towing the boat to safety. Mardini, who has settled in Germany with her family, went on to take part in the first ever Olympic refugee team at the Rio de Janeiro games last year. \u201cYusra is a deeply inspiring young woman,\u201d UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said. She added that the Syrian teen \u201crepresents the hopes, the fears and the incredible potential of the more than ten million young refugees around the globe. \u201d Mardini herself said she was thrilled with her appointment. \u201cI could not be more proud to be part of this team,\u201d Mardini told reporters in Geneva. \u201cThere is no shame in being a refugee if we remember who we are,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a refugee and I\u2019m proud to stand for peace, for decency and dignity for all those fleeing violence. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561903.1314714}
