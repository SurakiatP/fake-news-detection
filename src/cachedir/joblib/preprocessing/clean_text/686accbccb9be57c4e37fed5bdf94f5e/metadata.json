[Initial demands that Britain should pay into the European Union\u2019s   Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) until it expires at the end of 2020  \u2014   a year after Brexit  \u2014   have since expanded to include references to \u201cissues resulting from\u201d the budget, as well as those related to the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Development Fund (EDF).  German representatives are now suggesting that \u201cissues\u201d may include the Facility for Refugees, paid to Turkey, which currently stands at some \u20ac3 billion, of which \u20ac1. 5 billion has already been allocated and \u20ac777 million spent. The member states are insisting that a financial settlement is reached before addressing questions of trade. A senior EU official has admitted that it is impossible to calculate the full cost of \u201cpolitical commitments\u201d but warned that the other member states were determined to present a united front on the question of finance. \u201cWhat really surprised me was the unanimous view on the question of the financial settlement,\u201d he said of a preparatory meeting to draw up negotiating guidelines. \u201cI have never seen net payers and net contributors working so closely together to make sure the financial settlement and a substantive decision on this should be part of this \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 [before the issue of trade talks can be raised]. \u201d Prime Minister Theresa May has said that Britain will not pay to exit the EU, but will stand by her financial commitments. However, she has denied the commitments add up to \u20ac60 billion, as EU figures are suggesting. \u201cEven using their broadest parameters, we run the numbers and cannot get to \u20ac60bn,\u201d a British source told The Telegraph. \u201cA lot of the things being said by the European side now are simply unrealistic. Everyone is posturing and positioning. The negotiations will bring it all back to reality. \u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Britain not to harbour \u201cillusions\u201d that the Brexit negotiations can be run parallel to trade talks, reiterating the EU intended to stand its ground on negotiating a financial settlement before contemplating trade talks. Conversely, British negotiators in Whitehall have shown willingness to pay into the MFF beyond Brexit in the hope of buying good will on trade talks.'"}, "time": 1742562101.3656096}
