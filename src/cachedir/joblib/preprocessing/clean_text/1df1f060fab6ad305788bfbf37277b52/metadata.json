His first novel, \u201cThe Intuitionist,\u201d was set in the world of    Manhattan elevator repair. His sophomore effort, \u201cJohn Henry Days,\u201d geeked out on the tunnels dug by that mythic   man. But in his new novel, Mr. Whitehead grabs onto the most richly metaphoric conveyance of all: the Underground Railroad. That book, called simply \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d follows a    slave named Cora as she escapes north via a literal network of underground tracks and trains. The novel had generated the biggest buzz of Mr. Whitehead\u2019s career, even before Oprah Winfrey revealed on Tuesday that she had made it her latest book club pick. [ Michiko Kakutani\u2019s review of \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d ] Mr. Whitehead, 46, may be used to great reviews and enviable prizes, like the MacArthur Fellowship, the   genius grant, which he received in 2002. But a few days before Ms. Winfrey\u2019s announcement, he seemed a bit dazed by his impending ride into a bigger spotlight. \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time wrapping my head around how people are responding to the book,\u201d he said during an interview in his home office in Greenwich Village. \u201cI\u2019m someone who just likes being in my cave and thinking up weird stuff. \u201d \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d  \u2014   published by Doubleday, with a first print run of 200, 000 copies  \u2014   is written in a more straightforwardly realist mode than many of Mr. Whitehead\u2019s books, which have tended toward   premises, extended set pieces and jokey riffs. It begins with a harrowing depiction of life on a Georgia plantation around 1850, before taking off on a suspenseful journey through several different states with social systems that mash up racial terrors from decades far into the future. There is Whiteheadian weirdness  \u2014   hints of strange eugenics experiments Friday night lynchings staged like vaudeville shows and a kitschy \u201cliving history\u201d museum, where Cora   a sugarcoated version of plantation life  \u2014   but it creeps in slowly, with a subtlety that may send some readers to Google to check their memories of high school history. \u201cI went back and reread \u2018100 Years of Solitude,\u2019 and it made me think about what it would be like if I didn\u2019t turn the dial up to 10, but kept the fantasy much more  \u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be like the slave narratives I read, where you get a very    contemplation of all these weird and horrible things that keep happening. \u201d The idea for the book came to Mr. Whitehead around 2000, when he had just finished \u201cJohn Henry Days. \u201d \u201cI had the thought, \u2018What if the Underground Railroad were a real train? \u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI sat on the couch, thinking about it, but it seemed like it would require a lot of real research, and I just wasn\u2019t up to it. \u201d Instead, he wrote a string of very different books, including a nostalgic    novel (\u201cSag Harbor\u201d) a   zombie thriller (\u201cZone One\u201d) and a   account of competing in the World Series of poker (\u201cThe Noble Hustle\u201d). In the poker book, Mr. Whitehead, who had recently gone through a divorce, styled himself as a hyperactively wisecracking depressive who had a good poker face because, as he put it in the first line, \u201cI am half dead inside. \u201d In person, he comes off as friendly but guarded, and wary of the expectations put on an   writer who publishes a big book about race and freedom in the era of Black Lives Matter. He mentioned a bookstore owner from the South who invited him to come down for \u201ca frank talk about race. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m honored by the response to the novel, but I was like, \u2018Can we just talk about the book? \u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a representative of blackness, and I\u2019m not a healer. \u201d Still, he describes \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d which he began in earnest in the spring of 2014, as responding to a kind of inner pull. He was about to start another book with another \u201cexistential black dude narrator,\u201d as he put it, but the Underground Railroad idea kept coming to mind. \u201cI thought, why not write the book that really scares you?\u201d he said. Mr. Whitehead dived into the subject, reading classic   slave narratives like Harriet Jacobs\u2019s \u201cIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\u201d and oral histories of former slaves gathered by the Works Progress Administration  in the 1930s. Above his desk, next to an   menu board with   letters reading \u201cNext  \u2014   The Underground Railroad,\u201d is a   library with scholarly works by Eric Foner and Edward Baptist, Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved,\u201d a historical dictionary of   slang and Michelle Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe New Jim Crow. \u201d After he\u2019d written 100 or so pages of the novel, he let himself watch the movie \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d but turned it off in the middle. \u201cSeeing the movie really devastated me,\u201d he said. \u201cI could read about slave atrocities for days and days, but watching actors go through it was almost too much. I felt really messed up about what I was writing. \u201d Where books like \u201cJohn Henry Days,\u201d which centers on a cheesy festival celebrating a new John Henry postage stamp, have looked at the past through a distancing ironic lens, \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d goes right into the heart of the   historical experience. \u201cReading the book, I thought, he\u2019s written his \u2018Beloved,\u201d said the poet and critic Kevin Young, who has been close with Mr. Whitehead since their undergraduate days at Harvard. \u201cHe really conjures up the ghost of slavery and embodies it in a way that is deeply historically accurate. But the book also has these amazing leaps of imagination that help us think about slavery not just in the past, but in the present. \u201d Mr. Whitehead, who is married to Julie Barer, a literary agent, grew up in Manhattan, where his parents ran an executive recruiting firm. He went to mostly white private schools, but spent summers in an   beach enclave in Sag Harbor, N. Y. (the inspiration for the novel) where his maternal grandfather, who owned a chain of funeral homes in New Jersey, built a house from materials he hauled out each weekend in his car. Mr. Whitehead said he knew little about his own ancestors\u2019 experiences in slavery. His mother\u2019s family, he said, had included free black tavern owners in Virginia. His father\u2019s family was in Florida by the early 20th century, but how it got there was largely lost \u201cin the mists of time. \u201d Having children of his own  \u2014   his daughter is 11, his son almost 3  \u2014   made slavery more viscerally, and sometimes terrifyingly, real. \u201cThinking about the loss of a child, about how my own children would feel if they saw me beaten to death in front of them, made writing this book very different than it would have been if I had tried it when I was 30,\u201d he said. Mr. Whitehead has generally not been one for   celebration of   heroes. He and a friend once played around with a satirical website called Nat Turner Overdrive. The day after Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008, he published a riff of an   in The New York Times hailing it as a historic victory for \u201cSkinny Black Guys\u201d like Sammy Davis Jr. Michael Jackson and himself. In \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d he talks about racial progress, and its limits, in a more direct, even prophetic way. Near the end, a character is seen heading for St. Louis  \u2014   or, perhaps, Ferguson, Mo.   readers might find themselves thinking. Mr. Whitehead said he saw his closing pages as optimistic, but also realistic. \u201cI find the last pages very hopeful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still, wherever we go, we\u2019re still in America, which is an imperfect place. That\u2019s the reality of things. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563030.973089}
