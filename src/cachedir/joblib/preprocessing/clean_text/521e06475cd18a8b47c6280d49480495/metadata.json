[Business groups, led by the H2B Workforce Coalition, want him to include language in the 2017 supplemental budget which would allow companies to import another 100, 000 or more     visa workers for summer work at low wages. The supplemental must be completed by April 28.  But   groups want the number of visas kept at 66, 000 for the year, which will force companies to raise wages and to recruit some of the millions of young Americans who have dropped out of the workforce.  The   group thinks Ryan has decided to back   voters. \u201cSpeaker Ryan\u2019s decision to exclude the   returning worker exemption in the funding bill is a rejection of the business lobby\u2019s desire for cheap labor and a signal that Americans will come first under the [Donald] Trump administration,\u201d said a statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The statement continues:  Speaker Ryan is showing he stands with American workers by refusing big business calls for more cheap labor. Keeping the   worker exemption out of the government funding bill puts businesses on notice that Congress will no longer turn a blind eye to the harm mass immigration causes American workers. In December,  Ryan decided to not include the \u201creturning worker\u201d exemption in the 2017 federal budget, after he supported it in the 2016 budget. The exemption in the 2016 budget allowed companies to exempt visas for new   workers from the annual cap of 66, 000 visas if those workers had been an   worker in the previous three years. That \u201creturning worker exemption\u201d effectively boosted the annual size of the program from 66, 000 up to a maximum of 264, 000. If that exemption is reestablished for 2017, the   inflow would be larger than the annual inflow of roughly 110, 000   employees via the   visa program, which is mostly used by information technology and medical industries. Ryan\u2019s retreat from the   program is a notable change. He has long been an avid supporter of companies seeking to hire \u201cany willing worker\u201d from overseas in place of   Americans  \u2014   but the resulting economic and civic damage to American communities allowed Trump to take over the GOP and get elected in 2016. However, aside from his   turnabout, there\u2019s little evidence that Ryan supports Trump\u2019s successful populist campaign promise of lower immigration and higher wages. On the other side of the debate, business groups say they can\u2019t get needed workers, despite offering somewhat higher wages. They\u2019re short of seasonal landscape workers, bricklayers, kitchen crews, hotel maids, foresters, and fish processors, and even trainees for those jobs, say company executives.  \u201cWe just don\u2019t get applicants   \u2026     [even thought] we do everything we can imagine\u201d to recruit new season workers, said Glen Ellison, the owner of Ceres+ a landscaping and architecture company in Colorado. He offers his   workers a starting wage of $15. 11 an hour and U. S. workers even more. \u201cNobody wants to do the hard labor  \u2026     I have hired every single high school kid that comes to my company,\u201d he said. There are too few vocational schools teaching skilled trades to teenagers as the older workers retire, and too few Americans are willing or even capable of manual outdoor work, say employers. Society grants little status to   skilled work, and provides too much   welfare for people who don\u2019t want to work, employers say.  The problem is worsened by the federal government\u2019s refusal to penalize companies who hire illegals to undercut companies which hire Americans, said Gary Woodworth, chief executive officer at Gallegos, a building company in Colorado. Such hiring is \u201cprevalent,\u201d said Woodworth, who opened a   apprenticeship program and pays new employees $16. 55 an hour, or $34, 000 a year.  To sway Ryan and other legislators, company owners and executives from The   Workforce Coalition flew into D. C. on Wednesday to lobby their members of Congress.  The executives also tailor their argument for GOP leaders, saying the   workers support additional jobs for Americans and will go home at the end of each season, unlike illegal immigrants. Business advocates have won partial support from roughly 40 House members, who asked agency officials in   to minimize wastage in the distribution of the 66, 000 2017   visas.  A similar letter was signed by 31 Senators, led by North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who strongly supported   immigration programs when he was a state legislator.  More importantly, 53 House members signed a March 30 letter to leaders in the appropriations committee asking for the \u201cReturning Worker Exemption\u201d to be reestablished. The House signers include Republicans Barbara Comstock from Virginia, Kristi Noem from South Dakota, Elise Stefanik from New York, Thomas Massie from Kentucky, Barry Loudermilk from Georgia, and Tim Murphy from Pennsylvania. Business requests to hire foreigners instead of Americans usually receive a warm welcome in the established media, such as the Wall Street Journal. However, supporters of the visa workers programs know they are pushing a rock uphill after Trump\u2019s shocking victory in November, which was powered by   voters eager for reductions in   immigration. \u201cBrave folks\u201d are still willing to push for an amnesty and increased inflow of   admitted Michele Stockwell,   of public policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, at a March 2 meeting. Nationwide, \u201cwages for the   remain stagnant or in decline and well below what they were in 30 years ago,\u201d despite company complaints, said Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies. That huge social and political problem will be solved if legislators let the domestic labor market work, as labor supply will rise to meet higher wages and better recruiting, he said.  For example, roughly 10 percent of American \u201cprime age\u201d men, or 7 million men aged 25 to 54, have stayed out of the nation\u2019s workforce of 160 million amid the glut of cheap immigrant labor. The   Americans are not trying to get jobs, and are not participating in the nation\u2019s labor force, largely because of low wage rates, according to an August statement by Jason Furman, the chief economic advisor to former President Barack Obama. The glut of workers is worsened by the federal government\u2019s immigration policy. Each year, four million Americans turn 18 and begin looking for good jobs in an increasingly automated economy. But the federal government annually imports one million new legal immigrants plus one million new contract workers  \u2014   including the   and    \u2014   who are used by companies as cheap workers, as   customers, and as urban and suburban renters. However, there\u2019s much anecdotal evidence that the growing economy  \u2014   and the gradual reduction of illegal immigration  \u2014   is forcing companies to solve their workforce problems by offering higher wages, by training unskilled workers and even by recruiting unemployed Americans in     rural counties. The worker shortage has set off a \u201cbidding war\u201d for employees among Colorado landscaping companies, said Ellison.  \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see people get more competitive\u201d by offering higher hourly wages, said Jeff Seifried, president of the Chamber of Commerce in Branson, Mo. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a buck, $1. 50, or sometimes $2 raises   \u2026     [up to] the $11 plus range,\u201d he said. The city\u2019s seasonal employers need many people to clean hotel bedrooms, serve food and run entertainment facilities, but they can\u2019t raise wages too high for fear of deterring     customers, he said. Each year, the city offsets wage pressure by importing roughly 1, 000   and   visa workers.  But the cap on visa workers is forcing the companies to raise wages, broaden recruitment campaigns, to improve roads and regional bus services so that seasonal workers can commute from longer distances. Some companies are even considering providing weekday housing for seasonal workers who do not wish to move permanently from their distant homes, Seifried said. In Maine,  the Bangor Daily News recently reported that employers have started recruiting former convicts: \u201cJohnson, of the Somerset Economic Development Corp. has observed felony records to be \u2018one of the big barriers\u2019 to employment for Maine men, though employers are starting to be more open to hiring people with criminal records in response to the workforce crunch. \u201d But the national data shows no significant wage growth for   workers: Politically, if GOP leaders reject business\u2019 demands for more contract workers, \u201cit would put the Democrats on the defensive because it would be a substantial and real way for [President Donald] Trump to be the champion of workers over employers,\u201d said Camarota.  \u201cOne of the challenges in the U. S. economy is to draw back in the many people [who are] out of the workforce and one of the best ways to do that is to let wages rise,\u201d he said. But, he warned, \u201cit will take several years of strong wage growth to get them back to what they used to get paid, and even then they would be poor. \u201d This year, he said 19 months before the 2018 election, \u201cwhy not let their wages rise?\u201d '"}, "time": 1742562112.9097018}
