June 9th, 2016 \\nWhy is George Soros selling stocks, buying gold and making \u201ca series of big, bearish investments\u201d? If things stay relatively stable like they are right now, these moves will likely cost George Soros a tremendous amount of money. But if a major financial crisis is imminent, he stands to make obscene returns. So does George Soros know something that the rest of us do not? Could it be possible that he has spent too much time reading websites such as The Economic Collapse Blog ? What are we to make of all of this? \\nThe recent trading moves that Soros has made are so big and so bearish that they have even gotten the attention of the Wall Street Journal \u2026 \\nWorried about the outlook for the global economy and concerned that large market shifts may be at hand, the billionaire hedge-fund founder and philanthropist recently directed a series of big, bearish investments , according to people close to the matter. \\nSoros Fund Management LLC, which manages $30 billion for Mr. Soros and his family, sold stocks and bought gold and shares of gold miners, anticipating weakness in various markets . Investors often view gold as a haven during times of turmoil. \\nHmmm \u2013 it sounds suspiciously like George Soros and Michael Snyder are on the exact same page as far as what is about to happen to the global economy. \\nYou know that it is very late in the game when that starts happening\u2026 \\nOne thing that George Soros is particularly concerned about that I haven\u2019t been talking a lot about yet is the upcoming Brexit vote. If the United Kingdom leaves the EU (and hopefully they will), the short-term consequences for the European economy could potentially be absolutely catastrophic \u2026 \\nMr. Soros also argues that there remains a good chance the European Union will collapse under the weight of the migration crisis , continuing challenges in Greece and a potential exit by the United Kingdom from the EU. \\n\u201c If Britain leaves, it could unleash a general exodus, and the disintegration of the European Union will become practically unavoidable ,\u201d he said. \\nThe Brexit vote will be held two weeks from today on June 23rd, and we shall be watching to see what happens. \\nBut Soros is not just concerned about a potential Brexit. The economic slowdown in China also has him very worried, and so he has directed his firm to make extremely bearish wagers. \\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the last time Soros made these kinds of bearish moves was back in 2007, and it resulted in more than a billion dollars of gains for his company. \\nOf course Soros is not alone in his bearish outlook. In fact, Goldman Sachs has just warned that \u201cthere may be significant risk to the downside for the market\u201d \u2026 \\nGoldman Sachs is getting nervous about stocks . \\nIn a note to clients, equity strategist Christian Mueller-Glissmann outlined the firm\u2019s fears that there may be significant risk to the downside for the market. \\nUltimately, George Soros and Goldman Sachs are looking at the same economic data that I share with my readers on a daily basis. \\nAs I have been documenting for months, almost every single economic indicator that you can possibly think of says that we are heading into a recession . \\nFor instance, just today I was sent a piece by Mike Shedlock that showed that federal and state tax receipts are really slowing down just like they did just prior to the last two recessions\u2026 \\nUS federal personal tax receipts receipts are falling fast. So is the Evercore ISI State Tax Survey . \\nThe last two times the survey plunged this much, the US was already in recession. \\nIs it different this time? \\nAnd online job postings on LinkedIn have now been falling precipitously since February after 73 months in a row of growth \u2026 \\nAfter 73 consecutive months of year-over-year growth, online jobs postings have been in decline since February. May was by far the worst month since January 2009, down 285k from April and down 552k from a year ago . \\nLast week, the government issued the worst jobs report in nearly six years , and the energy industry continues to bleed good paying middle class jobs at a staggering rate. The following comes from oilprice.com \u2026 \\nThat may seem counterintuitive in an industry that has been rapidly shedding workers, with more than 350,000 people laid off in the oil and gas industry worldwide. \\nTexas is one place feeling the pain. Around 99,000 direct and indirect jobs in the Lone Star state have been eliminated since prices collapsed two years ago, or about one third of the entire industry. In April alone there were about 6,300 people in oil and gas and supporting services that were handed pink slips. Employment in Texas\u2019 oil sector is close to levels not seen since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009. \u201c We\u2019re still losing big chunks of jobs with each passing month ,\u201d Karr Ingham, an Amarillo-based economist, told The Houston Chronicle . \\nAt this point it is so obvious that we have entered a new economic downturn that I don\u2019t know how anyone can possibly deny it any longer. \\nUnfortunately, the reality of what is happening has not sunk in with the general population yet. \\nJust like 2008, people are feverishly racking up huge credit card balances even though we stand on the precipice of a major financial crisis\u2026 \\nAmerican taxpayers are quick to criticize the federal government for its ever-increasing national debt, but a new study released Wednesday found taxpayers are also saddled with debt, and are likely to end 2016 with a record high $1 trillion in outstanding balances. \\nWallethub, a site that recommends credit cards based on consumers\u2019 needs, said that will be the highest amount of credit card debt on record, surpassing even the years during and before the Great Recession. The site said the record high was in 2008, when people owed $984.2 billion on their credit cards. \\nWill we ever learn? \\nThis has got to be one of the worst possible times to be going into credit card debt. \\nSadly, the \u201cdumb money\u201d will continue to act dumb and the \u201csmart money\u201d (such as George Soros) will continue to quietly position themselves to take advantage of the crisis that is already starting to unfold. \\nWe can\u2019t change what is happening to the economy, but we do have control over the choices that we make. \\nSo I urge you to please make your choices wisely. \\n*About the author: Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog.

Each time he\u2019s made his bearish predictions, the market has gone up. Returns the last 5 months have been good ever since that bearish hysteria in January. Shedlock has been saying we are in a recession every week since 2011. \\nBear markets do happen every few years do these guys may be right this time. Broken clocks are sometimes right too. But consider the whole track record of these prognosticators Tim \\nA few months ago a wealthy coworker told me that he had about $50k in the stock market, and he asked me if I thought that was a good idea. I told him that I wouldn\u2019t have any money in stocks because I believe that a major correction is coming. He later told me that he had gotten out of stocks, and I told him that he was wise to do so. However, the correction that I spoke of still hasn\u2019t started, and my coworker seems to have taken a different attitude toward me. \\nI no longer talk about what I believe is coming because everything is so manipulated, and it makes me look like foolish when I\u2019m wrong. I believe I\u2019ll eventually be proven right. It\u2019s just a matter of time. I just wonder how much longer they can keep this going. This is insane. ali \\nCapital should always be diversify in a way so as to reduce exposure to a particular asset or risk. I think one should maintain a portfolio in gold as well as stocks and so on Since last 2 years I have missed some good opportunities to invest and get good returns in stock market, just thinking that the market collapse can be any moment. abc \\n1. There was a guy always bring an umbrella with him when goes outside, but no rain. One day, he decides not to bring an umbrella with him, and it rain. \\n2. Some people needs to learn the hard way. Priszilla \\nThat\u2019s me. Nowadays I don\u2019t care about the rain and leave the umbrella home most of the time. I have a dehumidifier at home that dries the home when I bring home wet clothes. JC Teecher \\nYou are not alone. \\nI tried to get my Dad, now 80, to sell off most of his stock last year before the August/September, \u201cpossible\u201d market collapse. he didn\u2019t, good thing, and after the short drop for a couple months, most of his stock investment has now hit decade highs. With some hitting record highs. \\nBut, he has no other investments, and little savings, except some junk silver. In late \u201908 I tried to get him to buy into a major stock that had dropped to less than 7 bucks a share. The average for the stock over the past twenty years had been about 17 to 20 bucks. I told him that he could easily double his money in less than two years. He didn\u2019t listen because his broker talked him out of it. \\nThat stock doubled in the first year, and two weeks ago hit an all time high of 70 bucks a share. \\nI believe a big sell off will happen this Fall. A lot of stocks are way over valued. Liberty First \\nI encouraged my wife to put all of her retirements into cash at present. What have we got to lose? A small potential gain short term, perhaps. But in 3-4 years there will be major bottom feeding opportunities. Meanwhile, I have a ton of money in gold stocks and silver (SLV). Be patient. And also, spiritual. We know that in the long term we will be right. It takes patience to sit through it, and enjoying family and other things of permanent value make it easyier. michael malachi \\npretty good idea with the silver, but maybe we should \u2013 as a nation \u2013 forget about money for a bit and begin to focus on being a better friend, neighbor, father, mother, sister, brother etc. You cant take it with you when you die. You will be remembered and judged by your relationships and actions (works). It is time to help those in need and love others. Don\u2019t forget the golden rule. Liberty First \\nVery nice. JC Teecher \\nFor some of us, we have been doing just that for years and years, and some even decades and decades. We realize that the only thing you take with you from this life, is what you give away. \\nHowever; there is nothing wrong with making money and becoming comfortably wealthy, as long as it doesn\u2019t become one\u2019s main agenda for everything. When greed takes precedence over charity, then it is time to unload it all and take up the cross. \\nI have never looked down on poor or disabled people that are doing the best that they can with the hand they have been dealt. \\nI look down on rich people that have the attitude, and especially those that \u201cact\u201d like they are rich, and act snooty towards others. sistersoldier \\nAmen and amen again JC. Christ came that we might have life more abundantly. Believers are to love God and grow in wisdom as these things are first and foremost and are more important than money. Just as you have stated we cannot take anything with us as only what we do for Christ will last. Money is a transient possession that is used for this brief life but no longer. Proverbs teaches us that it is better to have a little money but be right with God than a lot of money you obtained unjustly. JC Teecher \\nAmen to your thoughts as well. \\nMost people don\u2019t realize that we can be blessed with much more than we need, as a test, to see how we handle those blessings. \\nThe strings of prosperity sometimes ensnare us to the world. Our Father wants to know if our heart remains pure through the prosperous times as well as the lean. \\nI have found myself, in times past, forgetting that all the prosperity can vanish in a day. Believe me, when I say I have been tested many times. \\nThe key is to not make the terrible mistake of blaming God when all the prosperity vanishes. ITSNOTWhatchaThink \\nthere is no god JC Teecher \\nI wish that you could have the out of body experience that I had back in 2003. It literally shook me to the core, and before it was over I was completely aware of being in the spirit realm, and in my spirit body. so were the thousands that were with me. \\nIt \u2018s up to you, if you want to see it and feel it bad enough. Maybe i can help if at some point you have the desire to believe. Otherwise just accept that you have been blinded for your own protection, until the beginning of the Millennium, or until you give up the ghost/spirit. \\nBest wishes. sistersoldier \\nAnd that which you have so profoundly laid out \u2014 is wisdom. \u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.\u201d ITSNOTWhatchaThink \\nthere isn\u2019t a god Ken \\nJust a thought. I\u2019m a fan of silver, but not necessarily of the SLV. Like the GLD, there are likely more contracts per ounce than ounces in the vault to back it. Paper silver is like other paper \u201cassets.\u201d The SLV is being manipulated by the big banks as was admitted to last month by Deutsche Bank. It is entirely possible that your SLV goes higher, but you may not be able to sell it for currency. Check out Bix Weir\u2019s YouTube videos to get a deeper understanding of what I\u2019m talking about. My suggestion would be to convert your SLV to SLW or convert to physical silver you can hold in your hand. Gay Veteran \\nOne day, SOON< that co-worker would have wished he took your advice! Tim \\nHe did take my advice by getting out of stocks. But he may have put his money back into stocks. I don\u2019t know. Since the \u201ccorrection\u201d that I warned him about hasn\u2019t materialized he doesn\u2019t talk to me much anymore. Frankie \\nI would not waste any more time worrying about this person Tim. You gave advice that you thought was correct. We are all adults, this person CHOSE to listen to your advice, and probably got further information from other sources as well. YOU didn\u2019t FORCE him to sell his stocks, he CHOSE to do it and instead of ignoring you and now not speaking he should \u201cOWN\u201d his own decision to do what he did. I am of the same ilk as you, I have been preparing for some time for a MAJOR collapse. We think 2008 was bad??? Wait for it!! People have no idea, do not think it is remotely possible that the entire world could collapse with everything that is happening across the globe. I once wanted to help everyone but I realised a long time ago people have to want to help themselves. So now I am concentrating on myself and my family. I truly believe really bad times are coming. People need to learn to be RESILIENT. Those who you thought were friends will become enemies in their desperation, you will need to learn how to defend yourselves and how to \u201ceconomise\u201d and I am not talking \u201cmoney\u201d here, I am talking the basic necessities for life. ALWAYSTOMORROW \\nHow SOON? TrumpGodzillaRising \\nIt\u2019s wise to stay silent and simply observe, prepare your own sphere of influence as best you can and that\u2019s about it as collapse accelerates. You\u2019ll find that people become more insane as collapse accelerates. Jews never believed they were being sent off to be gassed even as they were herded onto the trains. Today we know different. Ignore the race hating a sec, focus on events as they are, reality as it is. \\nI think Soros recognises it\u2019s the global political dimension finally coming to a head, in other words, the people have finally had enough, you can see this globally in so many nations with so many problems converging to create this perfect storm that will feed off itself. \\nWe all know that none of the problems were solved post 2008, they were made infinitely worse. Here we are as predicted, 2015-2020 the collapse would accelerate and war would be the likely outcome when politics and diplomacy fails. In fact war is simply a continuation of politics. \\nIslamic State \\nThe world order is collapsing. michael malachi \\nWhen you have truth to offer \u2013 that truth must be brought out into light by sharing it with all who would listen. That is the job of a watchman. The problem is that too many see themselves as watchmen and most are just giving their opinions. A true watchman will have a true word of God that can not be refuted, but will likely be ignored. Opinionists tend to know it all and will make every effort to convince others that they are right. jox \\nA watchman that \u2018have a true word of God that can not be refuted\u2019 doesn\u2019t exist. michael malachi \\nAnyone can disagree with and make attempts to discredit a true watchman (scoffers), but truth will be realized at some point by all. Ye shall know them by their fruit. A good tree can not produce bad fruit and a bad tree can not produce good fruit. GSOB \\nRomans 8:1, 14, 16, 19 hut hut hike Scriptures speak otherwise. TrumpGodzillaRising \\nHence keeping opinions to yourself. The world is not ready for what\u2019s coming, the world will not thank you for what\u2019s coming. You can\u2019t change anything anyway now, it\u2019s too late. \\nRide with the chaos and simply try to survive as best you can, for as long as you can. \\nGood luck \\nI am sorry that you say that, may God show you his truth.

The Spirit sanctifies them. \\nHis Sovereignty is unquestionable, beyond ours to fully appreciate, yet become a man like us. \\nDifferent men use different bait but the message the true message is Peace with God through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The fire of Gods wrath has been satisfied in Him and He was raised for their justification and new life, eternal life in Jesus. \\nWhere is He now? \\nHow na\u00efve men are to think He don\u2019t exist, \\nenslaved to god of this age, in their sin. \\nWe see it in our children.

Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved and that by God. For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for him,\u2026. Yet, God causes all these things to work for their good.

The best manner, in which to talk about these things, is in terms of exactly what you just stated. That you know that something is coming, and it will be some time in the near future, but things are being manipulated, and it could come tomorrow, or it could be a little more time yet. Tell him that it\u2019s a good thing that it is being held off, so it gives people time to pray and prepare. Ask him if he is preparing, both physically and spiritually. Tell him that\u2019s the next step, and one that should be taken now, if he hasn\u2019t already done so. Take care, and God bless! sistersoldier \\nIf it is any comfort the people of Noah\u2019s day laughed at him as well and disbelieving asked, \u201cWhy are you building a boat on dry land?\u201d Gay Veteran \\ngreat fiction Heinrich van Rooi \\nThere are only two things to take in consideration and that is Time and Patience \u2026.

I\u2019ll say September to December range\u2026 Jim Clark \\nHe is a fool for listening to you. Markets go down occasionally. 25% of years have double digit declines. But it always recovers and market timing is very difficult. Have a diversified portfolio and ignore the chicken little brigade.

Walmart grocery section busy but other areas almost no one shopping. Childcare fees are horrendous. Food prices are rising. People laid off from work. I do not need Soros to know the economy is in bad shape. People who say they are doing well may in fact be truthful but millions of people are already enduring collapse.

All I can say it thanks George! your 250 million investment into ABX. Helped triple the investment I made last winter when their stock was at rock bottom.

Liberty First \\nYes, I got out of gld myself for ABX and some other miners. messtime \\nI know nothing about the precious metals market, but it seems there are a lot of people buying into it in some form or fashion. What i wonder about is that PM do not seem to be supported very much in the world: Meaning what are there? A small amount of buyers & sellers? What does a person do who wants to buy gold? Go to their local stamp & coin collectors store, pawn shop, or maybe order from some business online? It seems to me that if the banks and other financial institutions bought and sold gold coins & bullion, it would be part of the monetary system \u2013 i am talking about over-the-counter purchases & sales, or exchanges for paper money. Theoretically if the two businesses in some town went out of business you would have to find another broker in some other town to liquidate your gold coins or whatever you have in the form of gold. Nobody wants gold \u2013 just specialty buyers & sellers and that is during relatively stable times. In a large worldwide financial collapse with maybe PM merchants out of business then who is going to buy your PM? I do not think that PM are given the respect that they need in order to be a viable source of security. When i was in Vietnam the people there were always converting cash into gold & it probably worked for them well \u2013 but i do not think it was to make a profit but to protect their savings in case they were unable to trade their currency or if the north vietnamese over-ran the country they would be able to buy the new national currency. It is just something i wonder about. Not trying to start an argument. moulesnfrites \\nThe Greeks who held physical gold and silver and FIAT currency outside of the banking system are doing much better than those Greeks who can only access sixty euros a day, for the past two years. I am sure the same applies to the Venezuelans and Argentinians currently. \\nOnly a fool trusts government and banks. Take responsibility and choose the red pill. \\nA lot of the Jews who escaped Europe in the late 1930s only got past the border guards because of gold and silver. Thousands of years of history with gold and silver compared with about fifty years maximum for any FIAT currency. All FIAT currencies in history have failed.

Perishable and single use goods are best. Festival Tickets, cut flowers, toner, ammo and the like. Frankie \\nYes, I have to agree. People ARE responsible for their own misery.

Some racist remarks should draw us closer. df NJ \\nPresident Chimp was a reference to the George W \u201cthe boy wonder\u201d Bush. Not the black guy. ALWAYSTOMORROW \\nSorry. I\u2019ll remove my comment. df NJ \\nLeave it. Whether are you are on the right or the left, nothing will change as long as the corporations control our government. I hope Trump get\u2019s elected. Then maybe America can finally get the fascism-corporatism out of the way and we can return to public policies more favorable to labor and restore sanity. \\nI sure wish Obama never got elected. Priszilla \\nThe state is the power organ of the ruling class. They need the state to solidify their rule. \\nYou can\u2019t go against either of them. Not as citizens and not as president. You can only deny them influence by removing yourself from their reach. Guest \\nWho says he was \u201celected\u201d? Orac4Prez \\nI cant deny that. I still say that the government has no idea about the economy. Too many economists who have never made anything! And the new high tech companies only use other peoples talents and produce very few jobs compared to their capitalisation (Facebook and twitter etc) don\u2019t have many employees compared to say GE or Microsoft) Plus the older companies providing good jobs providing services to them. Plent of services now but now one can afford them. jaxon64 \\nGoiter-faced, slurping neo-con McCain never had a chance to win the 2008/2009 election. America was sick of war mongers like him regardless of what the economy was doing. No, the true powers that run the country had already decided for either Obama or Hillary to be the next ruse in line. Ultimately they told Hitlery that she would have to wait her turn\u2013now they are incensed because someone is running who is not part of their machine and they didn\u2019t give him permission to run for president.

Neither side politically has any real interest in reversing this trend. Trump\u2026\u2026\u2026 well the day he puts his money where his mouth is and quits indulging in cheap overseas labor to make his clothing line among other things ( which won\u2019t happen because he\u2019s a part of the problem) is the day I would start believing him.
