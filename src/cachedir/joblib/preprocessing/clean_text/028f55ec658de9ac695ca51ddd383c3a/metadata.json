He\u2019s not an engineer, producer or video director. But he has had a hand in every Grammy  \u2014   literally  \u2014   for the past four decades. Known as \u201cthe Grammy man,\u201d Mr. Billings, 70, is a master mold maker who has been designing, crafting and delivering the awards to the academy for more than half of his life. \u201cI\u2019ve been around them forever,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cEvery year they become more and more special to me. I\u2019ve always been a music fan, and the Grammys have always turned me on to so much I wouldn\u2019t hear if I just sat and listened to a radio station. \u201d For this year\u2019s ceremony, airing on Sunday night on CBS, 350 trophies were made. And yes, they were all created equal. \u201cWhen we\u2019re making Grammys, we don\u2019t know whose Grammy that\u2019s going to be, so we don\u2019t have one favorite,\u201d Mr. Billings said, adding: \u201cThey\u2019re all just like children. I really never try to question why someone is getting an award I do sometimes question why someone is not. \u201d Before artists can hoist the   award onstage in front of their peers, a lot of work must be done, which starts when the nomination list comes in. Mr. Billings and his team review it and estimate the number of Grammys that need to be cast to cover the nominees receiving the awards. In his    Ridgway, Colo. studio, the whirring of a polishing wheel and tapping of a hammer provide the soundtrack for his team of three, who tinker five days a week,  . \u201cWe really don\u2019t have an average day,\u201d Mr. Billings said of the   process needed to complete each trophy. \u201cThe guys who work with me really know what they\u2019re doing. We don\u2019t look at the clock, we don\u2019t rush these things. \u201d The awards are made of a custom metal alloy called grammium (yes, really) and are cast from three molds: one for the base, one for the gramophone cabinet and one for the tone arm, which holds the bell. After the pieces are cast, they go through a series of filing, sanding and polishing processes, and the gramophone cabinet and tone arm are plated in   gold. Once dry, the three pieces are assembled, and each award is   with a unique serial number for authenticity. The Grammys used during the television broadcast are for show Mr. Billings and his team engrave the names of winners onto plates after the event. Mr. Billings\u2019s relationship with the award began when he was 12, upon seeing his friend\u2019s father, Bob Graves, make the first one in his garage. In 1976 Mr. Billings became Mr. Graves\u2019s apprentice he took over production in 1983 after his mentor\u2019s death. \u201cIt means a great deal to us  \u2014   John is part of the family,\u201d said Bill Freimuth, the vice president for awards at the Recording Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s that personal service it\u2019s not dealing with some sort of an anonymous corporation. It\u2019s dealing with a person who is   who deals with making these beautiful works of art many times over. \u201d Over time the trophy, like the Grammy Awards show itself, has evolved. Since the first ceremony, in 1959, five different designs have been created the last major   came in the early 1990s, when Mr. Billings said he spent a year sketching and a few months fashioning three prototypes from scrap metal in his studio. The goal was simple: to keep the gramophone and its Art Deco influences but rework the tone arm, which was prone to breaking because of its thinness. Nearly 30 years later, Mr. Billings said he remains content with his design. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to stay exactly where it is,\u201d he said of the current Grammy. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason to change it. It\u2019s become very iconic. People recognize it and understand what it symbolizes. \u201d Once Mr. Billings and his team have made the finishing touches on each set of Grammys, it\u2019s time to send them to Los Angeles  \u2014   but not via FedEx or U. P. S. \u201cI\u2019ve always just   them,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think it would be a nightmare to try and ship these. In the old days, there weren\u2019t so many Grammys, so I would put them in my truck and make several trips. \u201d These days, Mr. Billings attaches a cargo trailer to his truck for the     journey. When the last Grammy is packed away and the trailer is locked, the team takes a moment to pause. \u201cWe open a bottle of champagne and write a date on the bottle and how many Grammys were made for that year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat caps it off  \u2014   the Grammys are done, now they\u2019re on their way. Then we start making them all over again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564099.3195195}
