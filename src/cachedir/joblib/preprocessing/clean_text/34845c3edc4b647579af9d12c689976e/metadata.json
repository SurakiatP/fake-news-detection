Most don\u2019t associate it with fishing, either. But Mr. Auerbach and a few other seafood entrepreneurs are using technology to lift the curtain on the murky details surrounding where and how fish are caught in American waters. Beyond Maine lobster, Maryland crabs and Gulf shrimp, fish has been largely ignored by foodies obsessing over the provenance of their meals, even though seafood travels a complex path. Until recently, diners weren\u2019t asking many questions about where it came from, which meant restaurants and retailers didn\u2019t feel a need to provide the information. Much of what\u2019s sold has been seen as \u201cjust a packaged, nondescript fish fillet with no skin,\u201d says Beth Lowell, who works in the   prevention department at Oceana, an international ocean conservation advocacy group. \u201cSeafood has been behind the curve on both traceability and transparency. \u201d What\u2019s worse is that many people have no idea what they\u2019re eating even when they think they do. In a recent Oceana investigation of seafood fraud, the organization bought fish sold at restaurants, seafood markets, sushi places and grocery stores, and ran DNA tests. It discovered that 33 percent of the fish was mislabeled per federal guidelines. Fish labeled snapper and tuna were the least likely to be what their purveyors claimed they were. Several years ago, Red\u2019s Best developed software to track the fish it procures from small local fishermen along the shores of New England. Sea to Table, a family business founded in the   with headquarters in Brooklyn that supplies chefs and universities, has also developed its own   software to let customers follow the path of their purchases. Wood\u2019s Fisheries, in Port St. Joe, Fla. specializes in sustainably harvested shrimp and uses software called Trace Register. And starting this fall, the public will be able to glimpse the international fishing industry\u2019s practices through a partnership of Oceana, Google and SkyTruth, a nonprofit group that uses aerial and satellite images to study changes in the landscape. The initiative, called Global Fishing Watch, uses satellite data to analyze fishing boat practices  \u2014   including larger trends and information on individual vessels. From a young age, Mr. Auerbach had romantic notions about fishing, specifically the idea of catching fish to feed his family and neighbors. \u201cIt\u2019s cool in this day and age that people wake up in the morning and go make a living interacting with nature and feeding their community,\u201d he said. He went into commercial fishing straight out of college, taking a job on an Alaskan salmon boat and later returning to New England to work on lobster boats and learn more about the fishing industry there. Soon after Mr. Auerbach founded Red\u2019s Best in 2008, he realized that a combination of government regulations and commercial fishing\u2019s embrace of technology were effectively threatening the existence of small fishing boats. Yet smaller boats travel short distances and catch fewer fish, which Mr. Auerbach said improves their quality. \u201cWe try to push people to eat local, traceable fish,\u201d he said. Like most other seafood distributors, he was relying on an antiquated,   carbon copy system that was so cumbersome, he was routinely shuffling paperwork until 2 a. m. \u201cThe boat would get a copy at the point of unloading,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. \u201cThe government would get a copy. I\u2019d file a copy. And then I\u2019d write in the prices. \u201d As for paying the fishermen: \u201cI\u2019d have to get checks and then match the checks to the paperwork and mail them. It was an absolute nightmare that wasn\u2019t scalable. \u201d Now the Red\u2019s Best software does that work. For instance, a company driver backs a truck down to the long wooden pier in Woods Hole, Mass. each afternoon, so that fishermen can load their bluefish, striped bass, bonito, conch, horseshoe crabs and other seafood. But instead of a thick pad of paper and carbon sheets, the driver wields a waterproof wireless computer tablet with a Bluetooth mobile printer. \u201cHe\u2019s putting their catch data directly onto the internet, and our whole staff all over the country can see in real time as fish is being unloaded onto our truck,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. When the fish arrives at Red\u2019s Best\u2019s Boston plant, it is instantly received into inventory and reported to the federal government. The company affixes a traceability label on each box of fish. The label has a   bar code that can be scanned by smartphones to reveal who caught the fish, where and how. A unique web page is automatically created for that fish. Buyers, typically   wholesalers throughout the country, and their customers can scan the code to learn the story behind the fish. Mr. Auerbach, who has 100 employees, projects the company will sell 20 million pounds of seafood this year, caught almost exclusively by 1, 000 small vessels. Eventually, Red\u2019s Best hopes to sell directly to consumers. \u201cLike, a bluefin tuna is being unloaded right this second in Provincetown, Mass. and you buy a pound of it to be delivered to your home tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI want that tuna sold as deep into the supply chain as possible. \u201d By that he means ideally the fish will travel from the company\u2019s Boston hub directly to home cooks\u2019 refrigerators. Currently, people can buy Red\u2019s Best fish at its store at the Boston Public Market, at several farmers\u2019 markets, or shipped through AmazonFresh and, starting last week, FedEx. \u201cI got the data,\u201d he said. \u201cI got the fish. I know people want it. \u201d Sea to Table hopes to sell fish directly to home chefs starting this year, too. But local seafood can cost more than many Americans are accustomed to paying, which partly accounts for the rampant seafood fraud in this country. \u201cU. S. fisheries are very well managed and are actually growing nicely,\u201d said Michael Dimin, the founder of Sea to Table. \u201cBut the U. S. consumer\u2019s been trained to buy cheap food, and imported seafood is really cheap because of I. U. U. fishing. \u201d I. U. U. stands for illegal, unreported and unregulated. The result is unsustainably fished, cheap seafood flooding American fish markets and grocery chains. \u201cTo us, the secret is traceability,\u201d Mr. Dimin said. \u201cIf you can shine a light on where it came from, you can make informed decisions. \u201d Mr. Auerbach concedes that some local fish is expensive, but he maintains that many   varieties are affordable. \u201cMaybe halibut and scallops are for the wealthy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut dogfish, skate, porgy and mackerel are all very inexpensive, healthy and great tasting. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628324.5012045}
