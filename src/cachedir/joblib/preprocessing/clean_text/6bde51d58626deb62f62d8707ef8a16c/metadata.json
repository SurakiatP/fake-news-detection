[Conway appeared on CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper 360 on December 30 and noted that accusations that Russia hacked the 2016 election are rising to a \u201cfever pitch\u201d since Donald J. Trump won the White House. She also pointed out that Obama seems to have motives other than serious foreign policy behind his moves.  Kellyanne Conway wonders if Russian sanctions were intended to restrict Trump https:  .  https:  .   \u2014   Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) December 30, 2016,  \u201cEven those who are sympathetic to President Obama on most issues are saying that part of the reason he did this today was to quote, \u2018box in\u2019   Trump,\u201d Conway said. Conway did not outright accuse the President of acting in bad faith. \u201cI was quoting David Sanger\u2019s piece in The New York Times,\u201d Conway insisted. \u201cI am merely saying that if The New York Times\u2019 report is true and credible, that that would be very unfortunate if politics were the motivating factor here, but we can\u2019t help but think that that\u2019s often true. \u201d The incoming President\u2019s adviser also pointed out that Trump is \u201cnot in favor of foreign governments interfering in our elections or interfering in our intelligence, but we\u2019re also not in favor of our intelligence interfering with elections after the fact. \u201d Earlier that Friday, President Obama took the unusual action of ejecting dozens of Russian diplomats from the country as he ramped up his response to his charge that Russian hackers interfered in the November elections. Despite Obama\u2019s constant claim, however, no actual proof has been forthcoming that Russia hacked our elections. In response to Obama\u2019s ouster of 35 Russian officials, Russian strongman Vladimir Putin dismissed Obama\u2019s actions and did not retaliate in kind as he has in the past. \u201cReserving the right to retaliate, we will not resort to the level of irresponsible \u2018kitchen\u2019 diplomacy,\u201d Putin said in a Friday statement, calling it \u201cregrettable\u201d that Obama was choosing to end his administration with such a provocative action.
