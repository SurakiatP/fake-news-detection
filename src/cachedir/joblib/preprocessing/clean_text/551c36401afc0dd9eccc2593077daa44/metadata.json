[During the annual In Memoriam segment Sunday night, a tribute to costume designer and   nominee Janet Patterson was botched when the Academy mistakenly used a photo of   Australian producer Jan Chapman.  The error was noticed quickly by dismayed Australian film industry veterans. \u201cOh dear. The #Oscars put up what I think is a photo of Jan Chapman, instead of Janet Patterson, for the In Memoriam segment,\u201d film reviewer Rhett Bartlett wrote on Twitter. Oh dear.

But the photo gaffe wasn\u2019t the only issue with the traditional segment. According to the Daily Mail, the segment left out actress Alexis Arquette, comedian Garry Shandling, producer Dan Ireland, actress Doris Roberts and actor Robert Vaughn. The in memoriam gaffe came before the chaotic and disastrous end to Sunday\u2019s ceremony that saw Moonlight win the prestigious best picture award  \u2014   but only after La La Land was mistakenly handed the statuette.
