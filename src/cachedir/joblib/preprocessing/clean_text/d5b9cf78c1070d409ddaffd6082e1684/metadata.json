In a letter sent on Friday to party officials, lawyers for Mr. Sanders said that the appointments of Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman, and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut violated party rules. Mr. Frank is to   the rules committee, and Mr. Malloy the platform committee. In the letter, Mr. Sanders\u2019s lawyer Brad Deutsch said that both men have been \u201charsh, vocal critics of Senator Sanders, and equally active supporters of his challenger, Hillary Clinton. \u201d Mr. Frank has called Mr. Sanders \u201coutrageously McCarthyite\u201d for his suggesting that Mrs. Clinton would be influenced by her speaking fees from Wall Street Mr. Malloy has led efforts among Clinton allies to attack Mr. Sanders\u2019s record on gun control. Under convention rules, Mr. Deutsch said in the letter, their open criticism of Mr. Sanders made them unfit to   the committees. \u201cTheir criticisms of Senator Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign,\u201d Mr. Deutsch wrote. \u201cThe chairs therefore cannot be relied upon to perform their convention duties fairly and capably while laboring under such deeply held bias. \u201d Democratic officials replied on Saturday morning with a letter from Jim Roosevelt, a retired health insurance executive, and Lorraine C. Miller, who head the party\u2019s permanent rules and bylaws committee. They said the appointments did not violate party rules, and that Mr. Sanders had not demonstrated otherwise. The question of Mr. Frank\u2019s and Mr. Malloy\u2019s qualifications had been settled in January, when they were first appointed, Ms. Miller and Mr. Roosevelt wrote, and there is no mechanism to revisit it. \u201cWe are compelled to dismiss it,\u201d they said. Mr. Sanders\u2019s efforts to disqualify the Clinton backers mark his latest bid to ensure that his ideas and supporters are well represented at the convention in July. And his battles with Clinton supporters have become increasingly bitter. This month, Sanders supporters erupted in protest at a state party meeting in Nevada, with some threatening the party\u2019s chairwoman there in a dispute over the selection of convention delegates. Mr. Sanders is preparing a major push to influence the party\u2019s formal platform, and Mr. Frank and Mr. Malloy will each wield substantial power over that process. Mr. Deutsch\u2019s letter indicates that if necessary, Mr. Sanders will take his battle over the credentials of Mr. Frank and Mr. Malloy to the convention in Philadelphia. Both men were chosen in January by Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who has clashed with Mr. Sanders over her scheduling of primary debates and, more recently, his supporters\u2019 attacks on other Democratic leaders.'"}, "time": 1742562590.0523143}
