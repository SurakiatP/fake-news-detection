[\u201cAs part of an investigation into pedophile groups on Facebook, the BBC flagged 100 pieces of infringing content via the report button,\u201d Gizmodo reported. \u201cDespite its own rule that \u2018nudity or other sexually suggestive content\u2019 is forbidden, Facebook removed just 18. \u201d  \u201cWhen the BBC pointed this out to director of policy Simon Milner and asked for an interview, he agreed on the condition the BBC provided examples of the images  \u2014   for which Facebook then reported the journalists involved to the National Crime Agency,\u201d they continued. \u201cTo add insult to injury, after reporting journalists for complying with its request for examples of images that moderators had not removed, Facebook then canceled the promised interview. \u201d In a statement, Facebook accused the BBC of breaking the law while distribution images of \u201cchild exploitation. \u201d \u201cIt is against the law for anyone to distribute images of child exploitation,\u201d said Facebook. \u201cWhen the BBC sent us such images we followed our industry\u2019s standard practice and reported them to CEOP (Child Exploitation  Online Protection Centre). \u201d The BBC claims that some of the content found on Facebook included: \u201cI have been very disturbed by what I have seen, very disappointed that one year on we are still seeing images that are very sexualised, totally in my view unacceptable,\u201d said the Children\u2019s Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield. \u201cThe moderation clearly isn\u2019t being effective, I would question whether humans are moderating this, are looking at this, and also I think it is failing to take account of the context of these images. \u201d Facebook\u2019s response was also criticized by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). \u201cFacebook\u2019s failure to remove illegal content from its website is appalling and violates the agreements they have in place to protect children,\u201d declared the charity in a statement. \u201cIt also raises the question of what content they consider to be inappropriate and dangerous to children. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
