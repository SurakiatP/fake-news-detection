It didn\u2019t matter that the visitors to the Skylight Clarkson North event space in Lower Manhattan, where most of the shows were held, tried to drink away their worries at the cozy VIP Amazon Lounge or escaped into chatter about Alejandro G\u00f3mez Palomo, a young Spanish designer who shocked the front row with a show featuring men in frilly frocks or talked about the head of Ralph Lauren being unceremoniously shoved into the oubliette. Of the dozens of designers interviewed during a   marathon that ended on Thursday, not one failed to volunteer some expression of concern, anxiety, perplexity or stark anger about the barrage of executive orders, tweets and statements recently issued from the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s hitting people like a dagger in the heart,\u201d the designer John Varvatos said moments before his best men\u2019s wear show in years, at the Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in Midtown. Mr. Varvatos was referring to President Trump\u2019s order banning the entry of citizens from seven   nations and refugees from any country. \u201cPeople are in disbelief,\u201d Mr. Varvatos said. \u201cHalf the people in my company are from someplace else. \u201d So, it would seem, are half the personnel in the industry. Consider the major designers anchoring a men\u2019s wear fashion week now in its fourth iteration and gaining strength in terms of its offerings and the breadth of representation. Mr. Varvatos, for example, is a   American whose parents migrated from Greece and settled in Detroit. The   Ralph Lauren is the son of Askhenazi Jewish immigrants from Belarus. Raised in South Boston, Joseph Abboud was born in the United States to Maronite Christian parents who, seeking greater opportunity, fled Lebanon for America. Even the virtuosic   Raf Simons  \u2014   whose finely calibrated collection of satiny topcoats, boxy jackets and slouchy woolens was shown on Wednesday night  \u2014   has only recently transposed his    label to New York, where he also serves as chief creative officer of Calvin Klein. Notably, Mr. Simons chose as the locale for his debut on these shores a Gagosian Gallery, which is run by the   art world powerhouse Larry Gagosian, a California native whose grandparents were immigrants from Armenia. It is not only the big guns who can boast of a hyphenated heritage. The Ovadia twins, Ariel and Shimon, moved to Brooklyn from Israel in the early 1990s. The slick show they presented on Tuesday to an audience peppered with   stars and athletes was inspired, as Ariel said backstage, by a soccer obsession they share with their father, a man who got his start in the garment business selling children\u2019s wear from the back of a   Oldsmobile. A relative newcomer to fashion, Willy Chavarria presented a sublimely deadpan collection on Thursday that he titled \u201cBrown Power\u201d and showed on a group of   models that included a young trans woman and a Honduran food deliveryman. The clothes were inspired, Mr. Chavarria said, by Chicano youths in California towns like the one in the San Joaquin Valley where he was raised, a son of Mexican immigrants who worked in the agricultural fields. \u201cThe political moment is hard,\u201d Mr. Chavarria said, over the   din of recorded   at his presentation. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a call to action for a generation that maybe got a little lazy. It\u2019s up to us now to be harder ourselves  \u2014   to love harder, to fight harder, to come hard with our ideas. \u201d Ideas, as Mr. Downing said, are good things. And, as it happened, the week was rife with them. There were Mr. Chavarria\u2019s supersize denim trousers, his   coats of fur or washable alpaca, his knit caps discreetly embroidered with a rebuke to hate speech too coarse to be printed here and his athletic sweatshirts emblazoned with the timely: \u201cGender Bender Super Bawl Champions. \u201d There were Mr. Simons\u2019s innovative, oversize intarsia sweaters, developed in collaboration with the Woolmark Company, featuring hems that rode up at the back, kangaroo pockets on the chest and, in some cases, a vaguely ambivalent interpretation of Milton Glaser\u2019s \u201cI \u2665 NY\u201d logo. There was a Ralph Lauren Purple Label collection that gave scant indication that his company is in the midst of what one analyst called \u201cbrand confusion. \u201d Seldom bested as a conjurer of narrative fantasy during the   he has been in business, Mr. Lauren made it clear that his Gatsbyesque vision still has legs. Here he reimagined a young man of wealth as having humor enough to leave the house wearing a black satin dinner jacket whose subtle jacquard pattern depicts cowboys riding bucking broncos  \u2014   an image copied from a vintage sleeping bag  \u2014   and confident enough in his taste to wear a   suit of evening clothes in chocolate corduroy. Barely out of Parsons, Matthew Adams Dolan is already a name to reckon with, largely on the basis of an interest taken in him by a single superfan. \u201cRihanna\u2019s team saw my senior thesis and called in some things,\u201d Mr. Dolan, a   native, said modestly on Thursday, as a cluster of models slumped on a dais at the P3 studio at Skylight Clarkson North. \u201cShe gets photographed in them a lot, I guess,\u201d he added, referring to monster denims that resemble the offspring of a Carhartt jacket and a moving blanket. Mr. Dolan\u2019s affection for functional work wear, which he reconfigures in Brobdingnagian proportions, is only half the equation, he said. \u201cMy mom was a big quilter, and that\u2019s been a big influence on me,\u201d he said. That Todd Snyder\u2019s brightest ideas are often not original to him is something of which the designer makes no secret. For years, Mr. Snyder has mined thrift stores and the treasure troves maintained by folks like the   wizard Bob Melet for inspiration. As Mr. Snyder made clear in his Thursday show, his design skill lies in taking the   sports jerseys or the weary,   stadium coats he finds and then  \u2014   exploiting his savvy way with fabrics and his tailoring background  \u2014   turning them into covetable stuff like a handsome camel hair overcoat so pilled it looked as though he had skinned a family of teddy bears to create it. The primary idea driving Mr. Varvatos\u2019s latest collection, he said before his show, involved his conviction that millennial men now discovering the suit want something that keeps them from resembling their fathers. \u201cThey want to push out the boundaries,\u201d Mr. Varvatos said. He does, too. With his fall 2017 collection, the designer stuck to a restrained narrow silhouette for taut frock coats, biker jackets, barn coats and     jackets. And he confined his experiments to fabrication. Despite the best efforts of moral philosophers like Peter Singer, fur has been steadily making a comeback. The best designs at the Varvatos show were for things like a lynx print calfskin biker jacket that would make anyone want to become rock star or a flimsy topcoat lined with cropped shearling  \u2014   just the sort of stuff to give PETA conniptions. It\u2019s easy enough to guess at the outrage triggered in the mind of an   activist by Mr. Varvatos\u2019s wholesale dispatch of livestock. More challenging, perhaps, is imagining what a traditional male might make of the clothes created by Mr. Palomo. Invited to be a guest of the C. F. D. A. the designer  \u2014   who has generated a lot of press and engendered a small cult following at home  \u2014   brought with him a group of clothes that seemed relatively tame by his standards. It included trousers, that is, and a few items you might term suits. True, they came in purple satin brocade with   portrait collars or gold lam\u00e9 with flounces and neck frills or constituted little more than a white satin bustier worn with thigh boots and a pair of   briefs. Of all the many design ideas on display during New York Fashion Week: Men\u2019s, Mr. Palomo\u2019s were by miles the most fantastical and giddy. Yet, as the men\u2019s wear industry has been trudging steadily away from gender fluidity and toward masculinity as historically constituted, the sight of a guy kitted out in Cuban heels, a garter belt, a pair of shiny culottes or a flounced   costume seemed less outrageous than, perhaps, pass\u00e9.'"}, "time": 1742628575.1607342}
