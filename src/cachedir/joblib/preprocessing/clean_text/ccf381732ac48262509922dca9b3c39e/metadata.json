Or in Mrs Philip\u2019s case, old crown? All I\u2019ve heard is Miss Markle this, Miss Markle that, and quite a lot of Miss Markle the other,\u2019 he told one footman, sending him out for some hearing aid batteries and a Twix. It\u2019s understood Buckingham Palace insiders have been warned not to explain the true identity of \u2018Miss Markle\u2019 to the Duke of Edinburgh. \\n\u2018Why Prince Harry is suddenly interested in whodunnits \u2013 well it beats me. Didn\u2019t we have that Belgian detective to dinner once? You know, the one that wrote \u2018Ten Little\u2026 Ten little\u2026 bugger me it\u2019s gone. Anyway, there was ten of the little blighters, whatever they were, and then there were none. Ten Green Bottles? No, that\u2019s not it.\u2019 \\n\u2018That reminds me! Do you remember when Charlie got a thing for that pop group, Chicken Supreme? No that\u2019s not it. Edmundo Ros and the Supremes? No. Wait, it\u2019ll come\u2026..That reminds me. Has anyone seen my book of Negro Spirituals? I mean if we\u2019re going to get nostalgic with games of Cluedo, why not a bit of singing? \u2018Way Down upon the Swanee Whistle\u2026\u2019 \\n\u2018The Three Degrees! I knew it would come to me. Lovely lovely African American women! Charles was really smitten! There were three of them, and I could see what was going through the lad\u2019s mind. \u2018Eeny meeny miney mo, catch a..catch a\u2026something by his toe. Or her toe. He\u2019d have done alright there, instead of that thin woman and the one who smells of tobacco! Anyway, let\u2019s hope Harry keeps up his interest in Miss Markle. And reading in general. Wait a minute. Isn\u2019t it Miss Marple? Where are those batteries?\u2019 Share this story... \\nPosted: Nov 3rd, 2016 by nickb Click for more article by nickb ..
