The law firm is one of the nation\u2019s foremost authorities on ethical nonprofit management and regulation. \\nBand described Teneo as devoted to \u201cmerchant and investment banking services, corporate restructuring, public relations and communication services, and strategic advising services.\u201d \\nBut he said he \u201cleveraged\u201d his business activities to raise millions of dollars for the Clinton Foundation. \\n\u201cThroughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office, I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the foundation,\u201d Band wrote. \\nBand admitted in the memo the \u201cunorthodox nature of my roles\u201d at the foundation, but he defiantly defended his work, saying: \\n[R]ightly or wrongly, I believe \u2013 given the foundation\u2019s need to raise funds, the willingness of the partner owners of Teneo to help fundraise, and my historical role in carrying the majority of the fundraising burden \u2013 that Teneo should help raise funds for the Foundation, which it has. \\nOrtel told TheDCNF that neither Band \u201cnor any of the Teneo folks ever bothered to register as professional solicitation agents in NY, or anywhere else.\u201d The revelation could put Band and the foundation in legal jeopardy with the New York state attorney general\u2019s office, which regulate charities. \\nBand also revealed for the first time the wide-ranging for-profit activities he undertook that helped enrich the Clintons. The conservative government watchdog group Judicial Watch has described Teneo as \u201cClinton, Inc.\u201d \\nBand said in his memo that \u201cindependent of our fundraising and decision-making activities on behalf of the Foundation, we have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities \u2013 including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements,\u201d adding: \\nIn that context, we have in effect served as agents, lawyers, managers and implementers to secure speaking, business and advisory service deals. In support of the President\u2019s for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family \u2013 for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. \\nFormer President Clinton has frequently used free corporate jets for himself and his family, including those owned by people like convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . \\nAt the time Band authored his memo, Chelsea Clinton was disturbed about the ethics of mixing Band\u2019s for-profit activities with the foundation\u2019s non-profit fundraising. She retained Simpson Thacher \u2014 one of the top law firms in nonprofit management \u2013 to review all of the foundation\u2019s activities, including those of Band. \\nBand lashed out against Chelsea Clinton in a number of emails to John Podesta, the former White House chief of staff under former President Clinton who is now Hillary Clinton\u2019s national presidential campaign manager. \\nThis report, by Richard Pollock, was cross-posted by arrangement with the Daily Caller News Foundation.'"}, "time": 1742563951.8314095}
