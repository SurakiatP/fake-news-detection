{"duration": 0.07933568954467773, "input_args": {"text": "'So, the president of the Lakers  \u2014   the one who once posed in Playboy and dated the head coach  \u2014   created a stir last week by firing her brother, who had helped prepare for his job as the head of basketball operations by training horses. To replace him, she hired the franchise icon with the incandescent smile whose first day on the job last Tuesday represented the start of his experience as a basketball executive. His first move was to hire a general manager whose primary qualification seems to be that he was the agent of another Lakers icon, the one with the killer scowl. These novices will be counting on the expertise of the son of the Lakers\u2019 \u00e9minence grise, who stormed off years ago when he clashed with the head coach, the one who dated the owner\u2019s daughter. Got all that? All of this is just another drama in the House of Lakers, the   soap opera where familial ties are so inextricably binding they seem to have jumped off the pages of a Tolstoy novel. The Lakers, of course, have been the N. B. A. \u2019s   for spectacle ever since Jerry Buss bought them, along with the Los Angeles Kings, the once fabulous Forum and a   ranch, from Jack Kent Cooke for $67. 5 million in 1979. \u201cIn certain towns, certain teams are the backbone of that town,\u201d said Jeff Shell, the chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. \u201cIn Boston, it\u2019s the Red Sox. From my perspective, the Dodgers and Lakers have always been that. The personality of the Lakers, whether it\u2019s Showtime with Magic or Shaq and Kobe, there\u2019s always been the flash and glitz that personifies the town. \u201d He continued, \u201cThey\u2019ve always been a   organization that takes care of its fans, so you know that even when they\u2019re not winning, they had a plan. \u201d In recent years, though, that was in question. While celebrities still dot the courtside seats, the Laker Girls still dance and the franchise value has climbed to $2. 7 billion, according to Forbes, the halcyon days of championship runs are a distant memory. The Lakers are again anchored near the bottom of the Western Conference standings, headed for another of their worst seasons since they moved to Los Angeles  \u2014   all since the death of Jerry Buss four years ago. To that end, his daughter Jeanie, who was bequeathed stewardship of the team, decided last Tuesday to ax her brother Jim, the chief basketball   who, three years ago, had given himself a   timeline to restore the championship pedigree his father established by winning 10 N. B. A. championships. And having sent her brother packing, along with Mitch Kupchak, the team\u2019s longtime general manager, Jeanie Buss did what the Lakers have almost always done since her father bought the team. She turned inward. She hired Magic Johnson, the team\u2019s beloved star of the Showtime era, to oversee the team. Working underneath him as the general manager will be Rob Pelinka, who had been the agent for the recently retired Kobe Bryant. They will be joined by an assistant general manager, Ryan West, whose father, Jerry West, starred for the Lakers on the court and as a   architect until he decided he had had enough of Phil Jackson, the team\u2019s coach, after the 2000 season. If there were a Mount Rushmore of Lakers basketball, the visages of West, Johnson and Bryant would be chiseled onto it. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s happy she finally took action,\u201d said Kathy Schloessman, president of the Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment Commission, who has known Jeanie Buss since they took a physics class for nonscience majors at the University of Southern California. \u201cShe gave Jim the period of time he asked for, and she realized the brand is important, and she wants to preserve her dad\u2019s legacy. It was taking a beating, and she could only take it for so long. \u201d While there is skepticism within basketball circles about whether Johnson is best equipped to steer the Lakers in the right direction, it would be hard to find someone in Los Angeles with more good will to expend while trying. \u201cEverybody has a different opinion about Magic\u2019s experience, but he\u2019s definitely committed,\u201d Schloessman said. \u201cHe went after this job hard this isn\u2019t a flyby thing. This is important to him. He\u2019s going to be an attractive asset when he\u2019s trying to bring free agents. \u201d The Lakers have always swung big, back to the days before the Buss family when they worked out trades for Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem   and then with West luring Shaquille O\u2019Neal and having the foresight to see that a    Bryant would be a superstar. Kupchak, West\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, led a more recent renaissance when he plucked Pau Gasol from Memphis, a deal that led to two more titles. But in recent years, the Lakers had begun to regularly whiff. The former commissioner David Stern nixed a trade that would have brought the Lakers the perennial   point guard Chris Paul, and deals for stars like Dwight Howard and Steve Nash bombed. In the last few years, the Lakers failed to land any premier free agents, with LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony and LaMarcus Aldridge barely granting them an audience. When the Lakers, flush with   space after Bryant\u2019s retirement and with several promising players to build around, could lure only very modest free agents to come aboard  \u2014   think of Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov  \u2014   it was clear that time was running out on Jim Buss and Kupchak. The last straw seemed to be when they could not swing a deal last week for the tempestuous   center DeMarcus Cousins, whom Sacramento shipped instead to New Orleans for bupkis. \u201cMagic is such a dynamic leader on and off the court, that\u2019s going to translate to the basketball department,\u201d said Mychal Thompson, a former teammate and the Lakers\u2019 longtime radio color commentator. \u201cWhen Magic calls, every agent and free agent is going to return his calls. He can get an audience with the Pope. \u201d If it was easy to see coming, the breadth of Jeanie Buss\u2019s decision was striking. A defining characteristic of the Lakers, along with the championships and the embrace of Hollywood, has been that as the sports industry has become increasingly corporate, the Lakers essentially remained a family operation. All six children of Jerry Buss  \u2014   each of whom owns an 11 percent stake in the team  \u2014   have worked for the Lakers, and four still do: Janie, who heads community relations Joey, who runs the development league team, the   Jesse, who works in the scouting department and Jeanie, whose office sits above the team\u2019s practice court. Nor do you have to be a blood relative to be considered progeny. Lakers Coach Luke Walton is a former fan favorite as a player, as are two of his assistants, Brian Shaw and Mark Madsen. Jordan Wilkes, the son of the former Laker Jamaal Wilkes, is a scout. Linda Rambis, the wife of the former player and coach Kurt Rambis, is an executive. And Jerry Buss said he considered Johnson a son. True, there were often times when the family seemed like a dysfunctional one  \u2014   when Jeanie Buss, who is respected for her business acumen, carried on a longtime relationship with Jackson and when a public feud erupted between the two stars Bryant and O\u2019Neal  \u2014   but until recently, the entanglements never seemed an impediment to winning. And in Hollywood, well, the distractions only seemed to add to the charm. \u201cBig stars mean big drama,\u201d Universal\u2019s Shell said. \u201cOur biggest movie franchise is \u2018Fast and the Furious,\u2019 and the stars, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, they have drama from time to time. As long as you\u2019re winning and giving the fans a good experience, that adds to the fun sometimes. \u201d However, in recent years, the fun  \u2014   as well as the winning  \u2014   has dissipated, and the family business has become more business than family. With the N. B. A. lockout looming after the 2011 season, the Lakers laid off about 20 staff members, from trainers to equipment managers and scouts, including the longtime assistant general manager Ronnie Lester. A year later, Jim Buss passed over Jackson, who had departed after the 2011 season but was interested in returning, and instead chose Mike D\u2019Antoni as the new coach. Then last week, John Black, the team\u2019s publicist for more than 30 years, was pushed out with Jim Buss and Kupchak, who had been with the Lakers since his playing days. Jeanie Buss, in an interview on the Lakers\u2019 television network, said the decision to shake up the team was so hard to make \u201cthat I probably waited too long. \u2019\u2019 \u201cFor that, I apologize to Laker fans,\u201d she said. Where the new direction leads is another matter, as the Lakers, with all eyes on them once again, embrace their past, hoping not to become prisoners to it.'"}, "time": 1742628542.016121}
