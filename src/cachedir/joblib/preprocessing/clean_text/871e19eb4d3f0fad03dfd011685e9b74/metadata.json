Mr. Renzi had already tendered his resignation early Monday, after Italians overwhelmingly rejected a series of proposed changes to the Constitution on which he had staked his seat. On Monday, President Sergio Mattarella asked the prime minister to stay on to approve the budget for the coming year. The budget was passed on Wednesday, and Mr. Renzi formalized his resignation soon after. This time, Mr. Mattarella accepted, but he asked the government to stay on in a caretaker capacity to handle    affairs. The ball now falls into Mr. Mattarella\u2019s court. On Thursday, he will begin consulting with the leaders of Italy\u2019s political parties to verify the various options open to him. The Italian president could call for new elections, but he has made clear that he will not consider returning to the polls before a new electoral law has been passed. The current electoral law for the lower house is under review by Italy\u2019s constitutional court. The court announced on Tuesday that it would issue a decision on the constitutionality of the law, known as the Italicum, on Jan. 24. Another electoral law applies to the Senate, and Mr. Mattarella says he will not call new elections until a single electoral system covers both houses of Parliament, the Italian news media reported. The government crisis did not appear to rattle the Italian stock market on Wednesday, which closed up 2. 1 percent. Even Italy\u2019s banks, saddled with bad loans, closed higher. Political stability has always been elusive in Italy. A combination of a multiparty system and its electoral laws make it difficult for any one party to have a strong majority. The changes Mr. Renzi asked Italians to approve were meant to streamline the legislative process and shrink the Senate by   making it easier to pass necessary, if unpopular, overhauls to   the moribund Italian economy. Mr. Renzi had campaigned vigorously in favor of the changes to the Constitution, but 59. 1 percent of the voters rejected them. Mr. Renzi\u2019s government was one of only four governments to last more than 1, 000 days. He came to power in 2014 after staging an internal party coup, alienating his Democratic Party\u2019s more   factions. The referendum and subsequent fall of Mr. Renzi further aggravated this fissure, and speculation was rife in the news media this week over Mr. Renzi\u2019s role at the helm of the party. \u201cThere\u2019s an internal discussion that must be held that I think will be difficult,\u201d Mr. Renzi told members of his party on Wednesday afternoon. But he asked that the showdown not take place until after the Italian president resolves the government crisis. Mr. Renzi also said he would not be part of the delegation that is to meet with Mr. Matterella in coming days. The failure of the measures on the referendum call for \u201cample considerations,\u201d he said during a relaxed,     speech at the party\u2019s headquarters. He was warmly applauded. The problems that he, and the Parliament, had hoped to resolve through the proposed changes to the Constitution still have to be dealt with, he said. In a nod to the populist pull of the Five Star Movement, the party set to pose the biggest threat in the next elections, Mr. Renzi took a page from their playbook and said that his party\u2019s discussions in coming days would be streamed online. \u201cWe want to be transparent to all citizens, and to our people,\u201d Mr. Renzi said. Various people have been discussed as possible successors to Mr. Renzi, Among them are Pietro Grasso, president of the Senate, and Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s finance minister, who is respected in Europe. The president could also ask Mr. Renzi\u2019s party to try to form another government. In a newsletter published on his website on Wednesday, Mr. Renzi said he was not in a position to decide on Italy\u2019s future anymore. \u201cThe parties  \u2014   all the parties  \u2014   must accept their responsibilities,\u201d he wrote.'"}, "time": 1742562299.9615805}
