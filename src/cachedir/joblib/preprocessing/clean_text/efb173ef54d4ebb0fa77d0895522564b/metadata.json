[\u201cIt was a good speech,\u201d Geller said of President Trump\u2019s remarks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s just that President Obama had set the bar so low that just the mention of Islamic terror is cause for jubilation. That\u2019s how bad it is. \u201d  \u201cIt was a mixed bag. I hope that he follows through on many of these initiatives. These new centers for combating extremist ideology  \u2014   again, the fear of not naming the motive, of a motiveless ideology, is deeply troubling,\u201d she said.  \u201cOf course, King Salman\u2019s remarks were as telling and revealing as President Trump\u2019s,\u201d she added. \u201cThe idea that he does not speak to the Islamic teachings and text that call for jihad, he does not speak to jihadic doctrine. He spends the entire time telling us, preaching to us, that Islam is a religion of peace and that it has a history of coexistence. I don\u2019t know what period he\u2019s talking about because for 1400 years   Christians, and Jews, were forced to live in dhimmitude under denial of basic human rights. \u201d  \u201cAnd, of course, he cites that famous Koranic quote that CAIR cites, that President Obama cites, about if you save one life you save the world entire  \u2014   when, in fact, that is a Talmudic verse that was cribbed by the Islamic religion, and it really is an implied threat to the Jewish people. We don\u2019t have to get into the   of it, but the whole speech of King Salman\u2019s was a deception,\u201d Geller charged. (CAIR is the Council on   Relations, a political organization in the United States.)  \u201cI\u2019m very glad that President Trump talked about fighting ISIS because according to leaked emails from Hillary Clinton, the Saudis were supplying ISIS, and Qatar was supplying ISIS. They can\u2019t continue to play both sides, which the Saudis have done brilliantly for decades,\u201d she said.  \u201cSo when President Trump says, \u2018Drive them out of the mosques,\u2019 that\u2019s a tricky one because how are countries living under Muslim rule going to drive the most devout out of the mosques? That\u2019s where I think President Trump got it wrong, when he said that terrorists were falsely invoking the name of God. No, they\u2019re not. They\u2019re citing Koran chapter and verse. That was misleading,\u201d said Geller. \u201cIt is pure Islam. It is authentic Islam,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI mean, when he says that the terrorists do not worship God they worship death  \u2014   that\u2019s just not true. They\u2019re dying in the cause of Allah. They\u2019re not screaming, \u2018Death akbar.\u2019 They\u2019re screaming \u2018Allahu akbar.\u2019 They pray five times a day. If you look at ISIS videos, they pray after they slaughter in the cause of Islam. \u201d \u201cAbu Bakr   the Caliph of the Islamic State, has a Ph. D. and a master\u2019s in Islamic theology from the world\u2019s leading Islamic university,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cDo Western leaders presume that they know more than he does about Islam?\u201d Geller went on to \u201cemphatically state that the battle between good and evil was an extraordinary statement, wonderful\u201d in Trump\u2019s Riyadh speech. \u201cEven though the White House released the text calling it \u2018Islamist extremism,\u2019 he said \u2018Islamic extremism.\u2019 That\u2019s an important point because that word \u2018Islamist\u2019 is a ridiculous word. It\u2019s nothing except the person using it doesn\u2019t want to offend Islam by speaking unwelcome truths about the political nature of that religion,\u201d she argued. \u201cOverall, it was an A,\u201d she graded Trump\u2019s speech. Marlow noted that Trump surprisingly removed the qualifier of \u2018radical\u2019 Islamic terrorism and referred simply to \u2018Islamic terrorism\u2019 directly. \u201cIt was brilliant,\u201d Geller said, mocking how adversarial media outlets chastised Trump for declining to denounce \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d as if he were backing away from his campaign rhetoric, when, in fact, what he said in the Riyadh speech was even more blunt and direct. She also jeered at a CNN headline that took Trump to task for allegedly failing to discuss human rights in Saudi Arabia. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou had President Obama, who was aiding and abetting the mass slaughterers, who never uttered the word, who gave billions to one of the worst human rights violators on the planet, Iran  \u2014   and that was the CNN headline  \u2014   like they give a fig about human rights in Muslim countries! It\u2019s extraordinary. The coverage is almost Kafkaesque. \u201d Geller said it was \u201cthoroughly enjoyable\u201d to watch the media struggle to come up with talking points that portray Trump\u2019s Middle East trip as a failure. \u201cHe just delivered to the Saudis the largest arms deal  \u2014   and, of course, we know that is really because of Iran. Iran is fighting the Saudis in Yemen,\u201d she noted. \u201cPresident Obama would harp on this, the biggest victims of this extremism are Muslims themselves. That\u2019s a false narrative because the Sunni vs. Shia  \u2014   you saw that with ISIS when they would line up their victims and ask them specific questions about Islam. The Sunni don\u2019t think the Shia are Muslims, and the Shia don\u2019t think the Sunni are Muslims. They\u2019re fighting for who is the true Muslim. When the West says, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re killing Muslims\u2019  \u2014   again, that\u2019s in your mind, but not in the mind of the Sunni and not in the mind of the Shia. \u201d \u201cI am concerned about that arms deal,\u201d she added. \u201cThe common enemy of Iran and the Saudis, of course, is Israel. Right now, the Saudis need Israel because Iran has been newly emboldened and newly enriched and newly armed, thanks to President Obama. That\u2019s sort of scary.
