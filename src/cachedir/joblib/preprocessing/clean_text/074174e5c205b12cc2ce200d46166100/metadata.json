[That\u2019s the dramatic policy change  \u2014   not Trump\u2019s other curbs on Muslim refugee inflow  \u2014   which has caused a dramatic wave of   protests by   Islamic and Latino groups.   Trump is doing what American voters prefer. In June 2015, for example, a poll showed that 56 percent of Americans want to exclude migrants who believe in Islam\u2019s sharia law, which requires that democracy and civic norms by subordinated the Islamic scriptures. In contrast, only about 20 percent of Americans told the pollster that they did not oppose the immigration of people who believe in sharia law. Trump\u2019s support for American culture is the centerpiece of his Friday order on immigration, but the policy\u2019s importance has been overlooked by the   protests.  Trump\u2019s   declaration is a huge reform because it directly rejects the claim by globalist progressives  \u2014   including former President Barack Obama  \u2014   that foreign people have the same rights as Americans, including the right to live in the United States, regardless of who Americans prefer to invite into their home. Here\u2019s the critical passage from Trump\u2019s Friday order:  In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \u201chonor\u201d killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. Obama described the prior globalist policy in a Nov. 2014 speech to Democratic supporters in Chicago: Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.  If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t want those folks\u2019  \u2014   even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans. Obama made the same   claim in September 2015:  When I hear folks talking as if somehow these [foreign] kids are different than my kids or less worthy in the eyes of God, that somehow that they are less worthy of our respect and consideration and care, I think that\u2019s  . I don\u2019t believe that, I think it is wrong and I think we should do better, because that\u2019s how America was made. Obama\u2019s outside policy is expressed more crudely by the alliance of Islamic and   groups which is now protesting Trump\u2019s   immigration policy at airports. #SFO: \u201dNo borders, no nations, fuck deportations\u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Dieter Bohn (@backlon) January 29, 2017,  On Sunday evening, a senior administration official briefed reporters on Trump\u2019s   migration policy. \u201cThe reality, though, is that the situation [of large Islamic populations] that exists today in parts of France, in parts of Germany, in Belgium, etcetera, is not a situation we want replicated inside the United States,\u201d the official said.  The kind of large and permanent domestic terror threat that becomes   and   and becomes sort of a permanent feature, in case this, becomes a permanent feature of American life. We don\u2019t want a situation where, 20 to 30 years from now, it\u2019s just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis there is domestic terror strikes, stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted, or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature  \u2026     The United States is sovereign country. It is under no obligation to admit any particular person and we have a right to develop a system in which we\u2019re selecting immigrants that we think will be able to make positive contributions to U. S. society. This   policy is a huge threat to many advocacy groups, such as the orthodox Islamist groups now pushing to increase the inflow of Muslims into Americans society, the Latino advocacy groups who want more Latino voters, and the elitist Democratic Party, which expects to win national power by collecting votes from diverse immigrant voters. But Trump\u2019s huge shift to   immigration policy was welcomed by opponents of political Islam, including Brian Thomas, a writer for the JihadWatch website. The new policy, he wrote:  indicates that they know exactly what they\u2019re doing. This isn\u2019t something they put together in a week this is evidence of their entire thinking on Islam and the defence of the west. They\u2019re going to treat Islam as a hostile political ideology. That is what has been needed for decades. It is the reversal of the \u201cIslam is a religion of peace\u201d doctrine set in place by Bush on September 17, 2001. Many polls show that majorities of Americans are skeptical of immigrants\u2019 impact on American society, worry about imported jihad terrorism, oppose any increase above the current level of million immigrants per year  \u2014   that is roughly one new immigrant for every four American births  \u2014   and also oppose the continued inflow of cheap labor and unskilled refugees. For example, a September 2015 poll by Ipsos showed that: only 22 percent of Ipsos\u2019 respondents want the United States to accept 10, 000 or more migrants [per year]. That number includes 10 percent who want the country to accept 500, 000 or more migrants. Another 26 percent of Americans said they would accept up to 10, 000 refugees. The survey did not say that the country already accepts 70, 000 refugees per year.   percent said they want no additional refugees above the 1, 500, and 29 percent declined to answer the poll, indicating quiet opposition to greater inflows. An August 2016 poll of 2, 061 adults showed that:  three in ten Americans overall (36%) support taking in refugees from Syria. A majority of Democrats (56%) support admitting Syrian refugees in contrast only minorities of Republicans (18%) and Independents (32%) agree. These skeptical attitudes, however, are balanced with Americans\u2019 decent emotional welcome for most individual immigrants, and with their gratitude for the nation\u2019s generous history of immigration and support for constitutional rights. A December 2015  poll of 1, 140 registered voters by Quinnipiac showed that: most voters said Syrian refugees should not be allowed to come to the U. S. [but] most voters opposed banning all Muslims from coming to the U. S. with 66 percent of voters opposing the idea and 27 percent supporting a ban. A majority of Republicans, however, 51  \u2014   41 percent, approved of a ban on Muslims entering the U. S. Democrats largely opposed a ban,   percent, as did independent voters,   percent. So the polling data suggests that Americans want their freedoms shared with Muslims now living in the United States  \u2014   but they don\u2019t want more Muslims to come live in the United States. A February 2016 poll of Republicans in South Carolina showed that: When the poll asked \u201cWould you support or oppose banning Muslims from entering the United States?\u201d 60 percent of the state\u2019s GOP voters said they would support a ban. But only 29 percent of respondents said they would \u201csupport   \u2026     shutting down mosques\u201d in the United States, and only 25 percent said the disliked Islamic doctrines [of sharia] should be illegal. In June 2016, a poll of 803 registered voters was conducted by OpinionSavvy, via telephone, using automated questions, and with a margin of error of 3. 5 percent. First, the poll asked whether tourists and immigrants should be screened to check for their possible support of Islamic sharia. Seventy percent of respondents approved of the screening. The poll then asked the 70 percent \u201cDo you believe that individuals who support the practice of [Islamic] Sharia law should be admitted into the United States?\u201d  No, responded   of the 70 percent. That translates into 56 percent of total respondents preferring to exclude additional   Muslims. The overall opposition to the exclusion of sharia supporters added up to just 20 percent, with the rest undecided. The push and pull of these rival emotions, however, is overwhelmingly subordinated to Americans\u2019 lopsided desire that companies hire Americans first before importing more foreign immigrations or foreign contract workers. Polls show that roughly 80 percent of Americans say companies should hire of young Americans before hiring migrants. A July 2016 poll shows that roughly three out of four voters \u2014   including nearly three out of four Democrat voters \u2014   believe that \u201cinstead of giving jobs and healthcare to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and put Americans back to work. \u201d The view was shared by almost 90 percent of   and almost 70 percent of Hispanics.   In 2016, Trump\u2019s focus on jobs for Americans  \u2014   instead of additional immigration championed by Hillary Clinton  \u2014   helped him win a critical majority in the   \u201cBlue Wall\u201d states of Wisconsin Pennsylvania and Michigan. So now he is implementing the voters\u2019 preferences, amid a growing roar of protest from the   coalition of immigrant and   political activists. '"}, "time": 1742561835.735178}
