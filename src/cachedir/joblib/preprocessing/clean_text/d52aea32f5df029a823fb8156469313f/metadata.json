Huma Abedin has worked as Hillary Clinton\u2019s top assistant for years. You are likely familiar with Huma, as she is a regular on the campaign trail with Hillary, and has also been in the news for years as the wife of Anthony Weiner, the embattled former Congressman who is perpetually accused of sexting improprieties. Reportedly, the FBI is reopening its investigation of Hillary\u2019s private email practices after finding evidence of Huma\u2019s involvement on one of Anthony Weiner\u2019s electronic devices. It is a small world, isn\u2019t it? Another Clinton employee, a name that you may not be familiar with, is popping up in the news lately for reasons that are startling, to say the least. Justin Cooper is an Information Technology worker who is reported to have set up Hillary\u2019s private email server. Recently, he even testified before a House Committee, saying that he extracted information from Clinton-related smart devices before \u201csmashing them to bits.\u201d It is said that Cooper\u2019s testimony is the \u201cmost informative we have heard yet.\u201d Judge Andrew Napolitano has expressed concern over Cooper\u2019s access to this information, among other things, as Cooper did not hold a Security Clearance. \u201cHe was an employee of the Clinton family and of the Clinton Foundation, and he had complete and total access to the Clinton emails, and he had no security clearance,\u201d Judge Napolitano explained on \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d today. Unfortunately, for Hillary and Huma, new, leaked information has come to light, and it has Justin Cooper\u2019s name all over it: Justin Cooper was the Clinton aide who set up the email server.Huma: \"My clinton [black]berry not working\"Cooper: \"We were attacked again\" pic.twitter.com/KjQcbocQzz \\n\u2014 Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) October 28, 2016 \\nYou read that correctly \u2013 \\nHuma: \u201cMy clinton [black]berry not working\u201d \\nCooper: \u201cWe were attacked again\u201d \\nSo Huma and the Clinton Staff knew all along that they were being attacked, also known as \u201chacked!\u201d \\nIt is shocking to think that high level State Department employees knew, for years, about such vulnerabilities. \\nIronically, if it were not for hacking organizations like WikiLeaks, American voters still would not have this troubling knowledge.'"}, "time": 1742561878.176716}
