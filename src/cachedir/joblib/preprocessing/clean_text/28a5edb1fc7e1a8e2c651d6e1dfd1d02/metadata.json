Clinton insider Sara Latham argued \u201cThe gmail one is REAL\u201d while even Clinton campaign IT specialist Charles Delavan said \u201cThis is a legitimate email.\u201d \\nThe first suspicious aspect of the email, unnoticed by the Clinton camp, was the \u201cbit.ly\u201d password reset link. Bitly, a website that shortens long web addresses, would not be found in an official email from Google. \\nAs first reported by Motherboard earlier this month, examination of the Bitly link that redirected Podesta to a fake Google webpage also contained several red flags. \\nThe Bitly link helped hide not only the fact that the landing page ended in \u201c.tk\u201d instead of \u201c.com\u201d but that the web page itself failed to use HTTPS encryption. Such links were also likely used to fool Google\u2019s spam filters. \\nPrior analysis of the phishing link by cybersecurity group SecureWorks revealed the hackers also made a significant operation security mistake \u2013 they failed to make their two Bitly accounts private. \\nThe public accounts revealed the hackers had created 8,909 similar links to use against 3,907 Gmail accounts between October 2015 and May 2016. \\nSecureWorks notes that the targets included \u201cindividuals in Russia and the former Soviet states, current and former military and government personnel in the U.S. and Europe, individuals working in the defense and government supply chain, and authors and journalists.\u201d \\nAccounts linked to the 2016 election were also in the hackers\u2019 sights. \\n\u201cSpecific targets include staff working for or associated with Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), including individuals managing Clinton\u2019s communications, travel, campaign finances, and advising her on policy.\u201d \\nThomas Rid, a professor at King\u2019s college, displayed on Twitter how decoding the phishing links could reveal the specific emails being targeted. \\nClick to enlarge Interestingly, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, whose emails were released by the website DCLeaks in September, was also targeted by the same hackers. \\nClick to enlarge This connection suggests the hackers who provided WikiLeaks with the Podesta emails and DCLeaks with the Powell emails are likely one in the same. The Bitly accounts are also behind the malicious email sent to retired four-star General Philip Mark Breedlove \u2013 whose emails appeared on DCLeaks in April. \\nNumerous cybersecurity groups have accused the Russian government of being responsible not only for the above election season hacks but for creating DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0. to disseminate the data. The U.S. government also publicly blamed Russia on October 7 just one week before the CIA was tasked with preparing a possible retaliatory \u201c cyber strike .\u201d \\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has denied involvement, arguing that the contents of the hacks are far more important than who is responsible. \\n\u201cListen, does it even matter who hacked this data?\u2019\u2019 Putin said on September 1. \u201cThe important thing is the content that was given to the public.\u2019\u2019 \\nPutin again dismissed US \u201chysteria\u201d concerning the hacks on Thursday during an annual speech at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. \\n\u201cHysteria has been whipped up in the United States about the influence of Russia over the U.S. presidential election,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people\u2019s choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power.\u201d NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles'"}, "time": 1742563290.3874676}
