Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo celebrated with an appearance in Utica, promising $585 million in state funds to cement the   partnership, which was to create 1, 000 jobs. Some in the crowd wept with emotion. But last week, after months of delays and mismanagement that culminated in September with federal prosecutors revealing a   bribery and   scheme, state and local officials said that the Austrian chip maker, AMS, had abandoned the project. The Utica project was merely one chunk of the   investment with which the Cuomo administration has pledged to seed nanotechnology and   industries in upstate cities starved for economic growth. But the corruption scheme outlined by federal prosecutors has strained the entire nanotechnology program, threatening to knock economic progress off course in places like Utica, where growth was never certain in the best of times. The state is now scrambling to salvage the Utica plant with a new corporate partner and state administrator. Related projects in Syracuse and Buffalo are in varying degrees of limbo. And the   unraveling of the Utica deal has raised anew questions about whether the state is spending its millions wisely by trying to engineer New York\u2019s Rust Belt into a can\u2019  destination for solar panel makers and chip fabricators. The governor\u2019s office has continued to insist on the initiative\u2019s health, both in Utica and across the state. It has promised that the full $585 million in state funds will remain committed to the Utica area. It has replaced the former architect of the nanotechnology program  \u2014   a physicist turned economic development guru named Alain E. Kaloyeros, the head of the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, who was indicted in the corruption scheme  \u2014   with Howard Zemsky, the   head of the state\u2019s economic development agency. To hear state officials tell it, a simple leadership switch will do the trick. \u201cPeople have seen a lot of progress. I think people continue to be optimistic about the future, and I think for good reason,\u201d Mr. Zemsky said in an interview, adding that he has had \u201cactive\u201d conversations with other chip makers about moving into the Utica plant. \u201cThe problem will turn out to be an opportunity. I\u2019m comfortable, all in all, that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. We\u2019re making up for lost time in many cases. \u201d For the state, it seems, the strategy developed by Mr. Kaloyeros and trumpeted by Mr. Cuomo  \u2014   to lavish hundreds of millions of dollars in state subsidies on corporate partners to create   jobs  \u2014   is unblemished. Yet the model has come in for repeated criticism from government watchdogs, who say an economic policy that tries to create risky new industries virtually from scratch, and that spends millions in taxpayer dollars to create every new job, is folly. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly skeptical of the economic logic behind these projects because they\u2019re too expensive,\u201d said John Kaehny, the executive director of Reinvent Albany, a   group. \u201cThere is no economic logic to this, really. But there\u2019s a huge political logic to it. The governor desperately needs for this to be a success for his political legacy in New York. \u201d Local officials have praised Mr. Zemsky as an inclusive and open manager. For those who watched the Utica deal crumble, however, his involvement was a belated acknowledgment that the state could have done better from the beginning  \u2014   and been better attuned to signs that the program was ailing months before the indictments made it obvious. \u201cShifting blame to the procurement process at SUNY Poly is drawing attention away from all the missed opportunities the governor\u2019s office had to step in and make sure the AMS project was moving forward,\u201d said Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat from Utica. \u201cI think the governor\u2019s office, essentially, when it came to economic development upstate, turned the keys over to Alain Kaloyeros, and unfortunately in the case of Utica, Alain drove the bus right off the cliff. \u201d Mr. Cuomo\u2019s aides reject the idea that the state has lost credibility in its efforts to revive the upstate economy, saying their economic development efforts were always much bigger than the ones Mr. Kaloyeros oversaw. \u201cSUNY Poly\u2019s narrowly focused on some very   tech projects, but for someone to say economic development, broadly speaking, has been turned over to to someone at SUNY Poly is just incorrect,\u201d Mr. Zemsky said, citing the governor\u2019s efforts to involve regional officials in economic planning and to spread state funds across thousands of smaller economic development projects. He said he was confident that they would ultimately bring the nanotechnology projects to fruition. \u201cThat is the only thing, at the end of the day, that can change that taste in people\u2019s mouths,\u201d he said. The chip fabrication project had been mired in    traffic for more than a year, local officials said, beginning in November 2015, when the state missed a deadline to begin soliciting bids for a developer to oversee construction of the chip plant. Local officials and the company had expected $585 million in state funding to be included in the governor\u2019s proposed state budget in January it failed to materialize. Weeks and months went by without updates. The chip maker was on edge, frustrated and incredulous that the process had stalled. After two months of asking, local officials were granted a meeting in March with the governor\u2019s top aides, Mr. Kaloyeros and one of Mr. Kaloyeros\u2019s aides, a lobbyist named Todd R. Howe, who had also worked for Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Kaloyeros dismissed their concerns. \u201cHow many chip fabs have you built?\u201d he asked, according to Mr. Brindisi, who attended the meeting. As the head of SUNY Poly, Mr. Kaloyeros was in charge of all economic development projects related to nanotechnology, overseeing projects including a solar panel factory in Buffalo and a movie production center in Syracuse. Andrew Kennedy, who was then the governor\u2019s deputy director of state operations, told the members of the Utica group that Mr. Howe would act as their liaison to the governor\u2019s office, Mr. Brindisi said. If they needed anything, they were told, they should go through Mr. Howe. Weeks later, when news leaked that the federal investigation into the state\u2019s economic development contracts had come to center on Mr. Howe and Mr. Kaloyeros, Mr. Kennedy\u2019s instructions ceased to inspire much confidence. For months, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s aides have tried to eke out some distance between his administration and Mr. Howe. \u201cAt no time did he represent or speak for the executive chamber,\u201d said Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor. The state budget passed at the end of March included the promised $585 million for the Utica project. But throughout the spring and summer, as Utica officials and the company sent increasingly urgent letters to SUNY Poly and the governor\u2019s office, the project was delayed still further. In August, Mr. Brindisi and Senator Joseph Griffo, a Republican whose district includes Utica, traveled to the state fair in Syracuse solely to corner Mr. Cuomo, believing the delays warranted his personal attention. The governor promised to call personally the next week, Mr. Brindisi said, but never did. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s director of state operations, Jim Malatras, said the governor had called him to relay what the legislators had said immediately after leaving the state fair, prompting the governor\u2019s aides to call Mr. Brindisi and Mr. Griffo the same day. Top economic development officials were in \u201cconstant\u201d contact with Utica area officials and AMS after the governor\u2019s office learned of their concerns, even traveling to Utica multiple times, Mr. Malatras said. Mr. Malatras said he had not been aware that the Utica chip plant was stumbling until late summer, despite what local officials said were repeated attempts to bring the problems to the attention of the governor\u2019s office throughout the winter, spring and summer. Not until the federal investigation prompted Mr. Malatras and Mr. Zemsky to delve into Mr. Kaloyeros\u2019s projects did they begin to realize that something was off, he said. Finally, in September, the governor\u2019s office sent word that the Utica project was being transferred from Mr. Kaloyeros\u2019s domain to Empire State Development, the agency led by Mr. Zemsky. A few weeks later, the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, released a criminal complaint charging Mr. Kaloyeros Mr. Howe Joseph Percoco, another former aide to the governor and several upstate developers in a yearslong bribery scheme. The complaint described a pattern of misconduct, mismanagement and corruption in the governor\u2019s signature economic development program. Smarting from the scandal, Mr. Cuomo announced a set of changes last month to the way the state would handle contracts. It was too late for AMS: The company withdrew around Thanksgiving, telling local officials that the delays had made it impossible for the company to begin producing its chip technology on schedule. \u201cI\u2019m very frustrated,\u201d Mr. Griffo said. \u201cObviously, it was a setback. \u201d He said he hoped the state would develop a process for regularly reviewing how effective its economic development programs were, but, like Mr. Brindisi and Mr. Zemsky, said he still believed a   partnership with a chip maker was the best option for the Utica site. Anthony J. Picente Jr. the Oneida County executive, recalled how the initial announcement of the hub had used the term \u201c\u201d which \u201ccreated an even greater sense of optimism. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through some tough times here in Oneida County over the years,\u201d Mr. Picente said. The collapse of the agreement, he said, \u201cdealt a blow. \u201d He added, \u201cIf this had been in the hands of the right people from the beginning, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be sitting here right now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628527.962926}
