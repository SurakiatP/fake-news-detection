Totally biased @NBCNews went out of its way to say that the big announcement from Ford, G. M. Lockheed  others that jobs are coming back. to the U. S. but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cAsk top CEO\u2019s of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!\u201d Trump was reacting to a \u201cFact Check\u201d segment on the Today show this morning about the jobs. \u201cHow much credit should the   be actually taking?\u201d asked Today host Matt Lauer. MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber reported that companies like GM said that their decision to announce the new jobs wasn\u2019t because of Trump, but rather part of their already planned expansions. Trump has met or spoken with several CEOs of major companies who have announced big job plans in America after his election, even before his inauguration as president. Melber said that Trump\u2019s impact on the jobs announcements were \u201cvery small or nonexistent\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a fantasy football aura to all of this,\u201d he said, suggesting the companies were serving shareholders first, not responding to Trump. But Trump signaled frustration with Today, a show that he has appeared on frequently during his career and presidential campaign. \u201cNo wonder the Today Show on biased NBC is doing so badly compared to its glorious past,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cLittle credibility!\u201d Big Government, Ari Melber, CEO, Matt Lauer, NBC, Today Show'"}, "time": 1742564617.8513162}
