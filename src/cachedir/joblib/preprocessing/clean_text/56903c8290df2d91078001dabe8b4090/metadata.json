The US\u2019 secret collaboration with terrorists is the reason why all attempts at a ceasefire and political transition in Syria have so far failed, the Syrian leader told Serbian newspaper Politika. The interview was also published by the Syria\u2019s SANA news agency.\\n\u201cSupporting the terrorists is a war of attrition against Syria, against Iran, against Russia, that\u2019s how they look at it. That\u2019s why not only this ceasefire \u2013 every attempt regarding ceasefire or political moving or political initiative, every failure of these things, the United States was to blame,\u201d the Syrian president said. \\nAssad was referring to the deal negotiated by the US and Russia in September, which it was hoped would pave the way for a lasting truce in Syria. In practice, the agreement was derailed by armed groups, which had rejected it from the very beginning. The US pledged to convince the so-called moderate opposition to stick to the bargain and separate from terrorists, who would then be legitimate targets for a joint Russian-American air campaign. Washington didn\u2019t deliver on this promise, however. \\nAccording to the Syrian president, a lasting ceasefire was not what Washington sought from the deal in the first place. \\n\u201cThey always ask for ceasefire only when the terrorists are in a bad situation, not for the civilians. And they try to use those ceasefires in order to support the terrorists, bring them logistic support, armament, money, everything, in order to re-attack and to become stronger again,\u201d he said. \\nSometimes the US support for terrorist groups goes through its allies such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Assad believes, while occasionally they provide direct support even to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), a group that the Washington-led coalition was supposedly formed to defeat. An example of this came during an American attack on Syrian Army troops near Deir Ez-Zor, which happened while the US-Russian truce was in force, and which the US claimed was the result of a mistake. \\n\u201cThey attacked a very big area. They didn\u2019t attack a building to say, \u2018we made a mistake.\u2019 They attacked three big hills, not other groups neighboring these hills,\u201d he said. \u201cIn less than one hour, ISIS attacked those hills. It means that ISIS gathered their forces to attack those hills. How did ISIS know that the Americans would attack that Syrian position? It means they were ready, they were prepared.\u201d \\nHumanitarian mask, like in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan or Iraq Western media are currently focusing on civilian suffering in Syria and alleged atrocities committed by the Syrian government and its allies to justify deeper involvement in the war by whatever means the White House chooses, Assad said in the interview. \\n\u201cYou have a black-and-white picture; very, very bad guy against very, very good guy. It\u2019s like the narrative of George W. Bush during the war on Iraq and on Afghanistan,\u201d he described. \\n\u201cThe war in your country has been portrayed in the same way; as a humanitarian war where the West wanted to intervene in order to protect a certain community against the aggressors from the other community,\u201d Assad said, referring to the Balkan Wars and the partitioning of Yugoslavia. \u201cSo, many people in the world believe that story, the same in Syria; they use the same mask, the humanitarian mask.\u201d \\nWhile stressing any wrongdoing on the part of the government forces, the West ignores whatever atrocities the opposition commits, the president said. \\n\u201cThe terrorists killed during the last three days more than 80 innocent civilians in Aleppo, and wounded more than 300. You don\u2019t read anything about them in the Western mainstream media,\u201d he said. \u201cThey only single out some pictures and some incidents in the area under the control of the terrorists just to use them for their political agenda in order to condemn and to blame the Syrian government, not because they are worried about the Syrians.\u201d \\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about our children, or about innocents, and about civilization, about infrastructure,\u201d he added. \u201cBut actually, they only care about using everything that would serve their vested interests.\u201d \\nThe Syrian president doesn\u2019t expect the US approach to Syria to change, regardless of who wins the presidential election next week, he told the newspaper. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would be bad for his country, he said. \\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any good signs that the United States is going to change dramatically its policy toward what\u2019s happening in the world\u2026 or to obey the international law, or to care about the United Nation\u2019s Charter,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about who\u2019s going to be president; the difference will be very minimal, each one of them is going to be allowed to leave his own fingerprint, just personal fingerprint, but doesn\u2019t mean change of policies. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t pin our hopes, we don\u2019t waste our time with it.\u201d \\nA year without interference to stop war Assad reiterated his assessment that if Syria were left to settle its problems without foreign interference, it would take it no more than a year to end the conflict, saying that \u201cit is not very complicated internally.\u201d \\n\u201cOf course, that looks not realistic, because everybody knows that the United States wanted to undermine the position of Russia as a great power in the world, including in Syria. Saudi Arabia has been looking how to destroy Iran for years now, and Syria could be one of the places where they can achieve that, according to their way of thinking,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cBut if we say that we could achieve that situation where all those foreign powers leave Syria alone, we don\u2019t have a problem in solving our problem.\u201d \\nThe president said Syria has existed as a multiethnic multiconfessional entity for centuries and has significant experience in overcoming differences. \\n\u201cWithout all different colors of the society \u2013 Christians, Muslims, and the different sects and ethnicities \u2013 you won\u2019t have Syria. So, every Syrian citizen should feel fully free in practicing his rituals, his traditions, his beliefs. He should be free in order to have a stable country. Otherwise you won\u2019t have Syria as a stable country,\u201d Assad said. \\nThe war has been a huge ordeal for Syrian society, but it has made Syrians as a nation more united, not less, he added. \\n\u201cMany Syrians before the war didn\u2019t tell the difference between being fanatic and being extremist, between being extremist and being terrorist. Those borders weren\u2019t clear for many,\u201d the president said. \u201cBecause of the war, because of the destruction, because of the heavy price that affected every Syrian, many Syrians learned the lesson and now they know that the only way to protect the country and to preserve the country is to be homogenous, to live with each other, to integrate, to accept, to love each other.\u201d \\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think the effect of the war, in spite of all the bad aspects of any war like this war, but this aspect was positive for the Syrian society. So, I\u2019m not worried about the structure of Syrian society after the war. I think it\u2019s going to be healthier,\u201d Assad added.'"}, "time": 1742563811.333989}
