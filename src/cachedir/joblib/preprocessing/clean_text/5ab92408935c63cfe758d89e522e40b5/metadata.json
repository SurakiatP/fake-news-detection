After posting a message on Twitter criticizing Donald J. Trump for using an image of Hillary Clinton with a shape resembling the Star of David and a pile of cash, Ms. Schwartz spent the Fourth of July weekend getting trolled by   Trump supporters. Now she wanted to write about the experience. \u201cI feel an obligation to use whatever platform is available to me to bring that hatred out of the shadows, acknowledging it and discussing it,\u201d Ms. Schwartz wrote to the editor, Ken Kurson. Mr. Kurson responded swiftly, she said, with a single word: \u201cGo. \u201d He didn\u2019t see the piece until it was published online. It may not have been what Mr. Kurson was expecting. It did not simply criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s   supporters. It called out Mr. Trump\u2019s Orthodox Jewish    and de facto campaign manager, Jared Kushner  \u2014   the owner of The Observer. \u201cI\u2019m asking you, not as a \u2018gotcha\u2019 journalist or as a liberal but as a human being: how do you allow this?\u201d Ms. Schwartz wrote in the piece, which was published as an open letter to the owner. \u201cBecause, Mr. Kushner, you are allowing this. \u201d Mr. Kushner is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka. She converted to Judaism before their wedding, and they are raising their children Jewish. Though he has no political experience and no official role in the campaign, Mr. Kushner  has emerged in recent months as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most influential advisers, even as the Trump campaign has been embraced by   and other hate groups. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Kushner have denounced the hate messages, many of which have been directed at Jewish journalists who have written about the campaign. \u201cMr. Kushner, I invite you to look through all of those images in the slide show above, the vast majority sent in your   \u2019s name,\u201d Ms. Schwartz wrote, referring to some of the   Twitter posts she had received over the weekend. \u201cRight now, this hate is directed to one of your employees, but the message applies equally to your wife and daughter. \u201d \u201cAnd now, Mr. Kushner, I ask you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat are you going to do about this?\u201d In an interview Tuesday, Ms. Schwartz acknowledged that the piece  \u2014   headlined: \u201cAn Open Letter to Jared Kushner, From One of Your Jewish Employees\u201d  \u2014   was not quite what she had pitched to Mr. Kurson, and that she did not know if he would have approved had he known. \u201cIt did evolve as I wrote it,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for fear that Ken wouldn\u2019t sign off, but I agree it definitely makes it a little more incendiary. I got angrier as I wrote it. \u201d It was not clear whether Mr. Kurson, an old friend of the Kushner family, felt misled. He didn\u2019t reply to a phone call and email seeking comment Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Trump has denied that the image he posted  \u2014   and quickly deleted  \u2014   on Saturday was   saying that the   shape was not meant to be a Star of David, but could just as plausibly be a sheriff\u2019s badge or a plain star. In a statement, Mr. Kushner did not directly address Ms. Schwartz\u2019s criticism, but he defended his    as \u201can incredibly loving and tolerant person who has embraced my family and our Judaism since I began dating my wife. \u201d \u201cI know that Donald does not subscribe at all to any racist or   thinking,\u201d Mr. Kushner wrote. In an interview, Ms. Schwartz said she was not blaming Mr. Kushner for Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post. \u201cBut I wanted him to see the consequences of these \u2018mistakes\u2019 the Trump campaign makes that white supremacists celebrate as confirmation of their positions,\u201d she said. \u201cThe \u2018Jewish   \u2019 is seen as a Get Out of Jail Free card for many people, and he\u2019s tacitly permitting that. And I, as a fellow Jew and one of his employees, genuinely wondered how he could hide behind such willful ignorance. \u201d Asked if she was still employed by the paper, Ms. Schwartz replied, \u201cI hope so. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562160.5056784}
