Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nHillary Clinton did a quick presser in Iowa to respond to questions about the FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to appear to violate the Hatch Act 11 by participating in political activities 11 days before an election. \\nSecretary Clinton put pressure on Comey to explain himself saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard these rumors, we don\u2019t know what to believe. That is why it is incumbent on the FBI to tell us what they are talking about.\u201d \\nWatch here: Video: Hillary Clinton calls on FBI to release all of the info it has & explain the issue in question without delay https://t.co/rg57U1RqPf \\n\u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 \\n\u201cThe American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately. The director himself has said he doesn\u2019t know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not,\u201d the Democratic nominee said. \\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s incumbent on the FBI to tell us what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d Clinton said. \\nClinton pushed for more information to be released \u201cwithout delay.\u201d She said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasn\u2019t given advance notice. Clinton said she had not been contacted by Comey on this issue. \\nWhen asked what she would tell voters about her emails, Clinton responded, \u201cI think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails.\u201d \\nThis might be the right place to mention the 22 million emails the Bush administration \u201clost\u201d and the private RNC servers they used, as context for how important this issue really is to Republicans as a value. \\nKristen Welker asked if Clinton was afraid that this could sink her campaign, to which Secretary Clinton responded with a big laugh: \"Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton,\" a reporter shouts as HRC walks out. Clinton only lets out a big laugh. \\n\u2014 Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) October 28, 2016 \\nThe Republican FBI Director James Comey wrote the House on Friday to inform hopeful Republicans that they had found new emails relating to Clinton\u2019s private email that begged further investigation. \\nIt turns out the emails didn\u2019t come from Clinton\u2019s server and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any there there, except for giving Republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote. \\nFederal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act, and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against Comey . \\nHillary Clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point. How many years on is this? Republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long it\u2019s DOA. The press has followed Republicans\u2019 lead with the absurd email story- a story as ridiculous as it is common, and a story that was never a story until Clinton did it. \\nRepublicans and some in the press think this might sink the Clinton campaign. So they think America would rather put Putin\u2019s puppet who laughs about sexually assaulting women in the White House than someone whose emails we\u2019ve all read now and found nothing much but gossip. \\nYeah, I don\u2019t think so. \\nDead story was dead before it started, but that won\u2019t stop it from being spun into blood match.'"}, "time": 1742563697.0506325}
