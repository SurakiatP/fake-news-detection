Now, it appears, there is no trusting anything that comes from China marked \u201corganic.\u201d \\nNatural Health 365 reports that several foods within the country are so contaminated that Chinese citizens don\u2019t trust them. What\u2019s more, the countries that import these tainted foods are putting their citizens at risk. \\nU.S. Customs personnel often turn away food shipments from China because they contain unsavory additives and drug residues, are mislabeled, or are just generally filthy. Some Chinese food exporters have responded by labeling their products \u201corganic,\u201d though they are far from it. \\nThere are several factors at play which make Chinese claims of organic unreliable. First, environmental pollution from unrestrained and unregulated industrial growth has so polluted soil and waterways with toxic heavy metals that nothing grown in them is safe, much less organic. Also, there is so much fraudulent labeling and rampant corruption within the government and manufacturing sectors that it\u2019s not smart to trust what is put on packaging. \\nIn fact, farmers in China use water that is replete with heavy metals, Natural Health 365 noted in a separate report . In addition, water used for irrigation also contains organic and inorganic substances and pollutants. Chinese \u201corganic\u201d food is so contaminated that a person could get ill just by handling some of it. \u2018Dirty water\u2019 is all there is \\nThe report noted further: \\n\u201cThis is reality \u2013 all of China\u2019s grains, vegetables and fruits are irrigated with untreated industrial wastewater. The Yellow River, which is considered unusable, supports major food producing areas in the northeast provinces.\u201d \\nMany Chinese farmers won\u2019t even eat the food they produce, if you can believe that. That\u2019s because it\u2019s clear that China\u2019s water pollution issues are so pronounced that it threatens the country\u2019s entire food supply . \\nChinese farmers have said there is no available water for crops except \u201c dirty water .\u201d As part of the country\u2019s industrial prowess, it is also one of the largest producers (and consumers) of fertilizers and pesticides, Water Politics reported. \\nThe site noted further that as China\u2019s industrial might grows, so too does the level of contaminants in the country\u2019s water supply. Lakes, rivers, streams and falling water tables are becoming more polluted by the year. \\nIn addition to man-made pollutants, animals produce about 90 percent of the organic pollutants and half of the nitrogen in China\u2019s water , say experts at the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning. There are times when water is so polluted it turns black \u2013 yet it is still used to irrigate crops, and of course, that affects so-called organic farming operations as well. \\nThese nine foods are particularly vulnerable to becoming tainted, Natural Health 365 noted: \\nFish: Some 80 percent of the tilapia sold in the U.S. come from fish farms in China , as well as half the cod. Water pollution in China is a horrible problem, so any fish grown there are suspect. \\nChicken: Poultry produced in China is very often plagued with illnesses like avian flu. \\nApples and apple juice: Only recently has the U.S. moved to allow the importation of Chinese apples, though American producers grow plenty for the country and the world. \\nRice: Though this is a staple in China and much of the rice in the U.S. comes from there, some of it has been found to be made of resin and potato. \\nMushrooms: Some 34 percent of processed mushrooms come from China. \\nSalt: Some salt produced in China for industrial uses has made its way to American dinner tables. \\nBlack pepper: One Chinese vendor was trying to pass off mud flakes as pepper. \\nGreen peas: Phony peas have been found in China made of soy, green dye and other questionable substances. \\nGarlic: About one-third of all garlic in the U.S. comes from China. \\nShop wisely.'"}, "time": 1742562806.7718766}
