I couldn\u2019t get out. \u201d She was bedridden and unable to walk because of venous stasis and cellulitis, a painful bacterial infection that covered the lower half of her body with large,   sores. Ordinary tasks, like getting out of bed every morning, became impossible. It was a drastic setback for someone who loved to move around on her own. As a child born and raised on Monroe Street on the Lower East Side, she loved exploring the city by foot. When she was 20, she had a job at a toy factory on Broadway, and it was there that she met her husband, David Oshman. They divorced in the late 1980s after 35 years of marriage, but Mrs. Oshman recounted fond memories of their active, early years together: Dancing the jitterbug on Fridays and Sundays at a club on the Lower East Side (\u201cAnd he was some jitterbug dancer!\u201d she said) fishing for pogies off a Coney Island pier and when they had children, a son and a daughter, taking family vacations to the mountains. Most of all, though, she said she loved doing the simpler things around the house: washing the walls, scrubbing the floors and cooking her favorite Jewish delicacies, stuffed cabbage and pot roast. But her health took a bad turn around 50 and deteriorated over the last three decades. For the last two years, Mrs. Oshman has made many trips between Mount Sinai Beth Israel hospital at 16th Street and First Avenue, and Gouverneur Health on the Lower East Side, and then back to her apartment. \u201cTwo years of hell,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I mean hell. \u201d The back and forth became so strenuous that her doctor helped Mrs. Oshman get a hospital bed  \u2014   not the centerpiece she would have preferred  \u2014   so that she could receive medical care in her apartment. She was home, but she was miserable she could not lie comfortably in the new bed and often resorted to sleeping upright in a wheelchair. The ordeal became a dangerous cycle: She struggled to stand on her own, meaning she spent more time bedridden and immobile, which intensified the swelling, redness and pain. \u201cI don\u2019t want money, I don\u2019t want jewelry,\u201d Mrs. Oshman said, glancing at her still swollen legs, wrapped in compression socks. She added, through tears: \u201cThe only thing I want, at this stage in my life, is to be able to walk again. \u201d Over the summer, Mrs. Oshman\u2019s doctor recommended a special recliner that could help her stand up, but Mrs. Oshman could not afford it. Every month she receives $1, 251 in Social Security benefits and $180 in food stamps, which is not enough to cover her monthly grocery bills. She pays $406 a month to Medicaid for the home care services, and $350 monthly toward her apartment. She was 62 when she retired from Citibank, where she was a greeter and an assistant to bankers, after she got too sick to continue working. Mrs. Oshman left with no retirement savings and does not receive financial support from her children. She has been getting help from the Educational Alliance, an organization that offers a social service program for people over 60. The Educational Alliance is a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. When the Alliance learned of Mrs. Oshman\u2019s need for the recliner, the group used $799 from the Neediest funds to buy it. It arrived in August. \u201cThis chair saved my life, and I\u2019m not kidding when I tell you that,\u201d Mrs. Oshman said. \u201cI was suffering with the hospital bed, and because of this chair, I\u2019m able to walk again. It\u2019s a blessing. I\u2019m doing more for myself than I ever did. I\u2019m changing myself. \u201d She has had to relearn tasks once taken for granted: standing up on her own, dressing herself and getting into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m living since I got this chair,\u201d she said, tilting it up and down. It even has a massage function and heated seats. \u201cWhat should we name it?\u201d she asked, referring to the chair draped in a bright purple sheet and   blanket. Mrs. Oshman has been able to get out of the apartment more in recent months than she ever did during the last few years. She is again walking the streets of the Lower East Side, where she grew up. \u201cI was a familiar face around the neighborhood then, and until this day, I still am,\u201d she said. \u201cI was away from here for two years, and when the aide took me downstairs one day recently, people stopped me in the street saying, \u2018What happened to you? Where were you?\u2019 And all I said was, \u2018I\u2019m back. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564057.5523884}
