The forecast could lead to major consequences for humans. \\nThe Living Planet Report 2016 says that animal losses are on track to reach 67 percent in the 50 years to 2020. The report\u2019s authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline, citing a 58 percent plummet between 1970 and 2012. \\nThe researchers analyzed the changing presence of 14,152 monitored populations of the 3,706 vertebrate species \u2013 mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles among them. \\nAccording to the paper, the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging. Pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem.

A d v e r t i s e m e n t \\nAnimals across the planet are expected to be affected. However, rivers and lakes are the hardest-hit areas. Barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures. \\n\u201cWe are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,\u201d the Stockholm Resilience Center\u2019s Professor Johan Rockstr\u00f6m said in a foreword for the report. \\nThe decline in wildlife, along with climate change, is part of the proposed notion of Anthropocene, a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on Earth\u2019s geology and ecosystems. \\nThe notion \u2013 which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time \u2013 can lead to major consequences. \\n\u201cThe richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse,\u201d WWF Director-General Marco Lambertini said, as quoted by the Guardian. \\nIn fact, the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition, noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition. \\n\u201cIncreased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources,\u201d the report states. \\nThere does, however, appear to be some hope. Some species are beginning to recover, suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis. \\nHowever, Barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place, society must largely change how it consumes resources. \\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to think that was a no-brainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business,\u201d Barrett said. \\n\u201cThe report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are,\u201d he added. \u201cMy hope though is that we don\u2019t throw our hands up in despair \u2013 there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it.\u201d \\nThe new report comes less than two months after a similar analysis found that Earth has lost one-tenth of its wilderness sites since the early 1990s.   6:41  '"}, "time": 1742628478.4714909}
