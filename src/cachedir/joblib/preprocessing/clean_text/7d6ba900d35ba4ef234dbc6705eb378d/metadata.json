(Image via Ephemera Studio) \\n\u201cWith great difficulty, we\u2019ve had to put all the wedding preparations on hold, stand in queues to deposit old currency for new legal tender and without even a day\u2019s break, resume the preparations and planning. All thanks to demonetization. At the end of it all, the last thing we want is another set of old currency notes which we\u2019ve to take to the banks for another exchange stint. We don\u2019t want to be loitering around banks when should be honeymooning in exotic locations. In order to prevent this, we wish to inform all our guests that we have installed an envelope scanning device right at the entrance. You will be asked to pass your envelope through the scanner. If your envelopes are found to contain old currency, they will be handed right back to you. We\u2019d rather you congratulate us without any gifts, than give us invalid currency,\u201d Soubhagyavati, the bride-to-be told The UnReal Times . \\nWhile the move has already reduced the anticipated guest number by the hundreds, the couple is determined to stand by their idea. \u201cA lot of people have already informed us about \u2018urgent meetings,\u2019\u2018spouses unwell,\u2019 and other things right after we announced this development. That\u2019s still okay. We\u2019re not yet done though. We\u2019re also thinking of setting up an online transfer kiosk \u2013 so that people can swipe their credit cards and transfer money to us electronically, on the spot, if they really wish to gift us money,\u201d an animated groom-to-be, Chiranjeevi added. \\nThe couple\u2019s move won praise from across the border. \u201cWhat a great idea! Pity I didn\u2019t do this even in one of my weddings. The next time I marry, I surely should emulate this,\u201d an amazed PTI chief and former world-cup winning Pakistani cricket captain Imran Khan exclaimed. Bollywood actor Kamaal R Khan, however, was indifferent. \u201cMakes no difference to me, I anyway put only \u20b92 coins in all envelopes whenever I attend weddings,\u201d the Deshdrohi actor chuckled. MNS Chief Raj Thackeray lauded the move, while also suggesting that those caught gifting such notes be made to gift an equal amount to the Indian army, by cheque. \\nWhile many other wedding couples have been scampering all over the country in search of scanners, some have urged banks to grant them permission to conduct the weddings in their own offices. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely efficient this way \u2013 the moment we get old currency, we exchange it then and there. No loss of time. Plus it\u2019s booming business for the banks too,\u201d one such groom said.
