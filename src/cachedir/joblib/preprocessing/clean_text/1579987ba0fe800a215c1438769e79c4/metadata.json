Just 79 percent of all Republicans surveyed say they are voting for their party\u2019s nominee.\u201d \\nEarlier in the day, two Bloomberg polls that had Trump leading Florida by 2 points, and cutting Clinton\u2019s New Hampshire lead in half gave Republicans a bit of hope that the presidential election might be tightening, but the reality is that voting is already underway in 37 states. There are very few undecided voters remaining. \\nOutside of tracking polls, Donald Trump hasn\u2019t had a polling lead since July . Besides his brief July bump, Trump hasn\u2019t led Clinton in national polling since May. What the media and Republicans don\u2019t want to tell you is that this presidential election has been remarkably consistent. \\nThere is nothing in the polling to suggest that the election is tightening, or that Trump has significantly improved his odds of winning. \\nThose who are looking for a tightening in the polls should keep dreaming, because right now, it\u2019s not happening.'"}, "time": 1742628597.4392102}
