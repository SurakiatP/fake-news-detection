Trump, who said last week that a   judge was biased against him because of his heritage, said on Tuesday that his remarks had been \u201cmisconstrued\u201d and that he did not think that the judge\u2019s ethnicity created a conflict of interest. \u201cI do not feel that one\u2019s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a long statement in which he continued to raise questions about his treatment in the Trump University case. Mr. Trump created a firestorm last week when he suggested that Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, who was born in Indiana, was not handling his case fairly because of his immigration policies, which include deporting immigrants in the country illegally and building a wall along the southern border. The remarks were considered racist by Democrats and Republicans, several of whom distanced themselves from the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr. Trump said in his statement that he had many friends of Hispanic and Mexican descent and that he thought that his words had been twisted. The reversal was a rare one for Mr. Trump, who has tended to dig in after his provocative remarks have stirred controversy. However, after many Republicans started to panic about the direction of his campaign he tempered his tone toward the judge. \u201cIt is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. \u201d \u201cThe American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges,\u201d he added . \u201cAll judges should be held to that standard. \u201d Mr. Trump, who did not apologize for the remarks, continued to express doubts about Judge Curiel, noting that he was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama. \u201cDue to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the judge\u2019s reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the   judge\u2019s impartiality,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt is a fair question. I hope it is not the case. \u201d Heeding calls from Republican leaders to focus on issues that matter to Americans, Mr. Trump said he remained focused on bringing jobs back to the country. He also insisted that he would win the Trump University case. \u201cWhile this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI do not intend to comment on this matter any further. \u201d In an interview with The New York Times last week, Mr. Trump said it was clear that he considered Judge Curiel\u2019s heritage an issue: \u201cI\u2019m building the wall, I\u2019m building the wall. I have a Mexican judge. He\u2019s of Mexican heritage. He should have recused himself, not only for that, for other things. \u201d Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s critics said that his statement did not go far enough. Jeb Bush, a former rival for the Republican nomination whose wife is from Mexico, has been largely silent since exiting the race but on Tuesday said that Mr. Trump should fully retract what he said. \u201cDonald Trump should retract his comments, not defend them,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote in a post on Twitter. \u201cThere is no place for racism in the GOP, or this country. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563243.161377}
