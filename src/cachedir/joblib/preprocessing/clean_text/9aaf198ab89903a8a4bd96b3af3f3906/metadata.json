The book is set in the near future. Staten Island is the new Brooklyn, and all the characters use their \u00e4pp\u00e4r\u00e4ts to chat and shop and beam their lives out to the world, nonstop. \u00c4pp\u00e4r\u00e4ts are also equipped with a program called RateMe Plus, which constantly calculates (and broadcasts, of course) a status ranking based on users\u2019 jobs, financials and online popularity, which is gauged by the quantity and quality of what they share.   the most intimate details of your life is the only way to get ahead  \u2014   job promotions and romantic prospects depend on it. Shteyngart\u2019s extrapolations from   social media are beginning to prove surprisingly prescient. The biggest companies are now slaving away to bring his vision ever closer to real ity. It\u2019s not a philosophical or ideological statement on their part it\u2019s just that their business model is predicated on sharing, and finding new ways to extricate more and more from us. This spring, Facebook introduced its 1. 7 billion users to a new feature called Live, which allows anyone to broadcast his or her life in a   stream to friends and family. The company also said it would prioritize personal posts like Live over those from brands or news organizations  \u2014   a sign that, like Shteyngart, it thinks people are far more invested in voyeurism than in anything else. (And in theory, it should know.) In August, Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, followed suit with a feature called Stories, allowing users to post photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. The company described it as a way to \u201cshare all the moments of your day, not just the ones you want to keep. \u201d It all feels like harmless fun, but our online lifestyles have begun to make a real impact in our offline worlds, a trend that doesn\u2019t seem to be reversing. In 2014, Facebook talked with lenders about the possibility of linking profiles to credit scores, and one recent survey showed that 40 percent of   officers now say they peruse applicants\u2019   profiles in addition to evaluating G. P. A.s and essays. Social media tends to reward those who share the most  \u2014   which means we tend to see way more from certain people than we want to see. You probably already know what I mean, and have seen it in your own feeds, as friends,   and complete strangers faithfully transcribe their inner monologues in a   stream. Even those who make a living in the public eye aren\u2019t immune to the perils of oversharing  \u2014   on the contrary. Two recent examples come to mind: Jennifer Weiner, a very successful author by any measure (her 2002 book, \u201cIn Her Shoes,\u201d was made into a movie starring Cameron Diaz) recently wrote an embarrassingly long diatribe on Facebook blasting Oprah for not selecting her latest novel for her book club and the rapper the Game has posted obscene,   selfies on Instagram that emphasize an enormous bulge in his underwear that may or may not be Photoshopped. There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with either example  \u2014   but they each clearly underline the ways that social media has stripped away our ability to tell what is O. K. to share and what is not. It\u2019s not just that watching people vie for your attention can feel gross. It\u2019s also that there\u2019s a fine line between appearing savvy online and appearing desperate. In   contrast, let\u2019s look at Beyonc\u00e9 for a moment. Unless televised live performances count, she has never   a day in her life. She rarely gives interviews, so what we know is scraped from her   presence  \u2014   which isn\u2019t much. I can tell you what outfit and hairstyle Beyonc\u00e9 posted on social media last week, but I couldn\u2019t tell you where in the world she was, what the inside of her house looks like or even which continent her primary residence is on. Her images tend not to be   or even look as if they were taken with a cellphone. I couldn\u2019t tell you who took the photos of her, because, unlike most celebrities, Beyonc\u00e9 rarely posts selfies. I have no idea who comes to her pool parties, if she has a pool or has ever been to a pool party. I couldn\u2019t guess what she wears to bed. And yet, when I speak about her, it\u2019s as if we\u2019ve been attached at the hip since birth. I feel, very intimately, that I know her. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s feed is the rice cake of celebrity   feeds: low in caloric content but mystifyingly satisfying. Most people treat social media like the stage for their own reality show, but Beyonc\u00e9 treats her public persona more like a Barbie  \u2014   she offers up images and little more, allowing people to project their own ideas, fantasies and narratives about her life onto it. Take, for example, her response after a video leaked of her sister, Solange, attacking Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s husband, Jay Z, in a hotel elevator. Rather than posting   tweets explaining the whole thing, Beyonc\u00e9 simply posted a series of photographs of herself and her sister having fun, quelling any rumors of a rift. This logic extends to her creative work too. Earlier this year, she spent an entire album, \u201cLemonade,\u201d stoking rumors of marital strife with Jay Z. Lines like \u201cYou\u2019re gonna lose your wife\u201d seemed to confirm that her   relationship was on the rocks. The release of that album felt cathartic, an answer to questions about her personal life that her fans had been obsessing over for months. But then, before the fervor over that album faded, news of another album leaked: this time, a duet album. With her husband. In a single calendar year, Beyonc\u00e9 managed to reveal what seemed to be a lifetime\u2019s worth of secrets and pain, without it being clear whether she had revealed anything at all. If anything, that only made people want more. Conventional wisdom casts Beyonc\u00e9 as a control freak, and perhaps she is, but control isn\u2019t such a bad thing. Lately, I\u2019ve been thinking about her bifurcated self in the context of   cyberfeminist theory. In the 1980s, academics believed that technology would introduce profound changes for humankind, especially women. Donna Haraway, emerita professor of the history of consciousness and feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an inspiration for cyberfeminism, wrote that new technologies could liberate women from patriarchy and other oppressive systems. In the distant future, she believed, people could assume virtual bodies, allowing for \u201cpermanently partial identities\u201d that could exist beyond gender, beyond reproach and without limits. The internet preserved many of the same biases and hierarchies Haraway so desperately hoped we could escape. And there are no true cyborgs yet. But social media has, in its own way, provided us a means of generating other selves. We just haven\u2019t yet learned to set them free. Beyonc\u00e9 has, in her own way. The Beyonc\u00e9 we follow seems to live and breathe, and provokes a real emotional reaction. It\u2019s an illusion that feels intimate and real, a hologram self for us to interact with that, in theory, provides the actual Beyonc\u00e9 space to exist away from our prying eyes. This isn\u2019t a strategy that works for only the incredibly rich and famous. I believe it\u2019s a useful way of thinking about how we could all behave online. Why fret about oversharing, or undersharing, or to what extent our online selves are true to our ac tual self? We could instead use social media as a prism through which we can project only what we want others to see. We can save the rest for ourselves  \u2014   our actual selves.'"}, "time": 1742564554.7212868}
