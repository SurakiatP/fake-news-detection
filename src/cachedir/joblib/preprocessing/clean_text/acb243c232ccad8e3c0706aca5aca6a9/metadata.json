[\u201cHey, I\u2019m a nationalist and a globalist,\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m both. \u201d  \u201cAnd I\u2019m the only one who makes the decision, believe me,\u201d Trump said. But Trump also said that he would terminate NAFTA \u201cif we\u2019re unable to make a deal, but hopefully we won\u2019t have to do that. \u201d Trump\u2019s remarks come as debate swirls around his presidential campaign promise to end the North America Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA in contrast to his recent assertion that he will \u201cnegotiate\u201d a revision of the treaty that has guided U. S. trade policy with Mexico and Canada since 1994. The Journal reported that Trump received almost    calls from Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Following those conversations Trump said, \u201cThey\u2019re serious about it and I will negotiate rather than terminate. \u201d \u201cMeanwhile, Sonny Perdue \u2014  the agriculture secretary who took office two days earlier \u2014  and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with Mr. Trump and showed him a map indicating the states where jobs would be lost if the pact collapsed, according to a person familiar with the matter,\u201d the Journal reported, noting that many of the states on the map supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThose conversations, along with a flood of calls to the White House from business executives, helped steer Mr. Trump away from an idea that some of his own advisers feared was a rash and unnecessary threat to two trading partners who fully expected to renegotiate the agreement anyway,\u201d the Journal reported. \u201cI expect the administration to closely consult with Congress before such major   decisions are made,\u201d said Sen. Orrin Hatch ( ) chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade. \u201cWithdrawing from NAFTA would have significant effects on the America economy. \u201d Following Trump\u2019s election in November, Chriss Street penned a commentary for Breitbart News focused on how Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d message would strike a blow to \u201cworld socialism. \u201d \u201cThe election of Donald Trump now represents an existential threat to World Socialism across the planet,\u201d Street wrote. \u201cSocialists know that when President Reagan went rogue with his muscular capitalist policies, communism quickly imploded. Trump has already torn up the   Partnership, which would have internationalized the law covering $28 trillion in trade and investment, about 40 percent of global GDP. \u201cTrump seems determined to destroy \u201cSocialist Globalization\u201d with the same capitalist tax cuts and regulatory relief that President Reagan used to destroy communism,\u201d Street wrote. In an interview with conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham last month, former presidential candidate and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan said abandoning his populist economic message would be \u201cfatal\u201d for Trump\u2019s presidency.'"}, "time": 1742628338.168462}
