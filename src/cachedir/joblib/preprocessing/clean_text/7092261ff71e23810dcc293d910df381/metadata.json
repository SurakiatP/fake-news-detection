And, you know, we have \u2014  there\u2019s no question we have a dysfunctional Congress. I think to some extent we have a dysfunctional presidency as well at this moment in time. And I think everything, everything that can be done to try to put pressure on both Republicans and Democrats to work together to try to resolve these key issues, particularly on health care, is something that ought to be done now. \u201d \u201cI know the Democrats have to fight the Republicans,\u201d he continued. \u201cI know the Republicans are doing their thing to try to keep this within the party. But I really think that both parties need to look at the larger picture here, which is that literally, the United States of America will be affected by what they do, and they can\u2019t do this in secret, and they can\u2019t do this simply by fighting each other over these kinds of issues. They have to learn to work together to do what is right for our country. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN '"}, "time": 1742628412.1776648}
