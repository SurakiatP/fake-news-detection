They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\u201d Be Sociable, Share! Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Sunrise, Fla. \\nContrary to his anti-establishment stance \u2014 which supporters readily boast as a viable alternative to Hillary Clinton \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s establishment roots run so deep, the billionaire real estate mogul plans to appoint a former Goldman Sachs partner and George Soros Fund manager as Secretary of the Treasury should he win the election. \\nSteve Mnuchin came on board Trump\u2019s campaign as finance chair in May, raising eyebrows of many who felt his 17-year history with Sachs \u2014 and affiliation with liberal globalist George Soros as an Investment Professional of Soros Fund Management \u2014 conflicted directly with the then-presumptive nominee\u2019s conservative stance and criticisms of establishment politicians. \\n\u201cIt is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,\u201d Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky told Politico of Trump\u2019s curious choice for Treasury Secretary. \\nAccording to Fox Business Network , Trump\u2019s confidence in winning the White House has fomented enough to begin picking Cabinet members, and besides the anomalous choice of Mnuchin for the Treasury, sources said he\u2019s considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security Secretary. \\nTrump has, of course, expended great efforts in criticizing opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s deep ties to the banking and Wall Street elite; and prior to garnering the Republican nomination, extended that critique to competitor Ted Cruz, saying in one debate: \\n\u201cI know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\u201d \\nZero Hedge noted when Trump hired the left-leaning hedge fund manager and financier as finance chair that Mnuchin had previously donated multiple times to various Democrats, including Barack Obama and none other than Hillary Clinton. \\nFurther substantiating his establishing banking insider status \u2014 the precise profile Trump claims publicly to loathe \u2014 Mnuchin worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, headed OneWest Bank prior to its purchase by CIT Group in 2015, and now sits on CIT\u2019s board while also serving as chairman and chief executive of Dune Capital Management, a private investment firm with a focus on financing big-time Hollywood movies, like \u201cAvatar.\u201d \\nIf Mnuchin\u2019s Wall Street ties don\u2019t trouble Trump\u2019s supporters enough, the hedge fund manager\u2019s links to George Soros \u2014 an ardent Clinton fan \u2014 certainly will. \\nIn fact, in terms of opposition, Soros has spent billions influencing global politics by inserting his brand of leftism wherever possible \u2014 and earlier this year even pledged , with others, some $15 million specifically to mobilize Latinos and immigrants to defeat Donald Trump. \\n\u201cSteven is a professional at the highest level with an extensive and very successful financial background,\u201d Trump said upon bringing Mnuchin into his campaign. \u201cHe brings unprecedented experience and expertise to a fundraising operation that will benefit the Republican Party and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton.\u201d \\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s campaign, quoted by the Daily Caller , said Mnuchin \u201chas previously worked with Mr. Trump in a business capacity and brings his expertise in finance to what will be an extremely successful fundraising operation for the Republican Party.\u201d \\nWhile business dealings certainly bring ordinarily clashing personalities into contact on occasion, these details about the relationship between Trump and Mnuchin evidence the former\u2019s links to the left. \\nDespite the nominee\u2019s many diatribes excoriating Hillary Clinton as out-of-touch with the American populace, Trump\u2019s own status as a billionaire belies both their decades-old friendship and striking similarities \u2014 particularly as darlings of the establishment. \\nShould you choose to vote on the 8th, it would be prudent to keep in mind blustery campaign rhetoric \u2014 from any politician \u2014 only constitutes so much hot air. \\nThis article originally appeared on The Free Thought Project.
