[The park\u2019s website states:  The Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in the Civil War, the Union victory that ended General Robert E. Lee\u2019s second and most ambitious invasion of the North. Often referred to as the \u201cHigh Water Mark of the Rebellion,\u201d Gettysburg was the Civil War\u2019s bloodiest battle and was also the inspiration for President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s immortal \u201cGettysburg Address. \u201d Heiser reflects on the battle itself, as well as its significance to the United States over time. The national cemetery sprang as much, if not more, from the soldiers who fought there returning time and again, as it did from some national effort to establish a monument. \u201cThe opportunities for the South to win that summer were never as high as before and never would be as high again. I think that\u2019s why Gettysburg is so highly regarded not just by historians, but even by the veterans. The soldiers who fought here came back again and again and again. They\u2019re the ones who gave it that label, the   mark of the Confederacy. \u201d Heiser also discusses Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg address. \u201cWhat the president was trying to do,\u201d said Heiser, \u201cwas revitalize the Union effort, rejuvenate the American spirit, especially those in the North. Why are we fighting this war? Why are so many young men, fathers, sons now dead on the battlefield lying in what will be national cemeteries? How do we remember their sacrifice? I think that\u2019s why it was so important and why he accepted the invitation to come that fall. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
