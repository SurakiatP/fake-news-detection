[The company, founded by   Rican immigrants in New York, will withdraw $200, 000 in patronage from the event, according to local legislators.  L\u00f3pez Rivera, identified as the head of the radical Marxist Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) terrorist group, was freed Wednesday after receiving a pardon from President Barack Obama. His supporters argue that he is an icon of Puerto Rican nationalism, a deeply divisive issue among the U. S. citizens who inhabit the island and praise his refusal to accept a pardon from President Bill Clinton that required him to express remorse for his participation in terrorist acts. Goya\u2019s withdrawal from the parade followed news that L\u00f3pez Rivera would be honored the title of \u201cIcon of Liberty\u201d at the event, scheduled for June 11. The corporation\u2019s public relations head, Rafael Toro, told Fox News, however, that the decision not to participate in the event was not directly tied to L\u00f3pez Rivera. \u201cIt was a business decision not to participate in the parade,\u201d Toro said, noting that a false company statement had made the rounds on social media. Despite the clarification, the move may result in added pressure on other corporate sponsors to also withdraw from the parade or risk being seen as supporters of terrorism. The Associated Press notes that among those corporations still participating are the    companies ATT, Coca Cola, and the New York Yankees. The New York newspaper El Diario La Prensa credits a group called the Youth of the New Progressive Party for beginning a social media campaign calling for the boycott of any corporation that participates in the celebration. L\u00f3pez Rivera himself dismissed Goya\u2019s withdrawal and threatened the business with a boycott. \u201cI think Goya would have more to lose if Puerto Rico boycotted it, and all Puerto Ricans, here and in the diaspora, boycotted Goya. So I think Goya has more to lose than us,\u201d he told reporters. L\u00f3pez Rivera arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Wednesday, greeted by an estimated four dozen supporters \u201cholding flowers and Puerto Flags, some chanting \u2018Free at last! \u2019\u201d according to the Associated Press. New York State Sen. Rev. Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz wrote in a column on his Facebook page that he has heard rumors that the airline Jet Blue may also withdraw from the parade, though Jet Blue has not considered withdrawing its business from the neighboring Caribbean country of Cuba, which maintains ties to terrorist groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Hezbollah. In his column, D\u00edaz lamented Goya\u2019s exit and called, \u201cas a Puerto Rican,\u201d for the company to reconsider. \u201cWithout Goya,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe parade has no seasoning. \u201d Parade organizers have not indicated that they have considered backing down from awarding the terrorists an honorific title at the ethnic pride event. In a statement published on their official website on May 12, organizers insisted that L\u00f3pez Rivera was worthy of praise despite his remorseless history of violence: We aim to use Oscar Lo\u0301pez Rivera and his story  \u2014   decades after  \u2014   to bring a message for peace, unity, compassion and reflection. Amidst the controversies surrounding Lo\u0301pez Rivera, we have been compelled by his early work as a community activist of Chicago\u2019s Puerto Rican community, and that his convictions led to more than 35 years without freedom, of which 12 were spent in solitary confinement several U. S. political leaders have conceded that Oscar\u2019s   sentence was out of proportion. Also, given the opportunity to shorten his time behind bars, he did not accept President Clinton\u2019s 1999 clemency, expressing that he could not leave behind Carlos Alberto Torres, who was detained along Oscar but was not included in Clinton\u2019s clemency offer. A key organizer of the event, New York City Council Speaker Melissa   affirmed this in a statement from Puerto Rico, where she had traveled to welcome L\u00f3pez Rivera to freedom. \u201cHis release is not only a win for our island, but for our country\u2019s democracy and criminal justice system \u2014  and that\u2019s why I\u2019m proud that tireless advocacy led to President Obama granting Oscar clemency,\u201d she said. \u201cWe stand in solidarity with Oscar, and I thank the National Puerto Rican Day parade for recognizing and uplifting his legacy. \u201d L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s FALN group is reportedly responsible for at least 130 bombings, mostly in New York, Chicago, and Puerto Rico, believed to have caused at least five deaths and more than $3 million in property damage. L\u00f3pez Rivera himself was sentenced to 55 years in prison in 1981, in a trial in which he told the judge, \u201cI am an enemy of the United States government. \u201d President Clinton offered L\u00f3pez Rivera a commutation of his sentence in 1999 that he rejected some argue he did so because a fellow FALN member was not offered the same deal, though L\u00f3pez Rivera said in an interview the year before that he had \u201cproblems\u201d with \u201catonement\u201d and refused to condemn his terrorist acts before being freed. His sentence was extended to 70 years following a prison escape attempt. L\u00f3pez Rivera is expected to be honored on Thursday at an event in Chicago, one of the cities his terrorist organization targeted. A local Chicago politician suggested in February that Chicago name a street after him. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742562636.4846172}
