November 2, 2016 \\nBruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. \\nFBI Director James Comey\u2019s reopening of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails has roiled once more the presidential election. Donald Trump has called the decision \u201ccourageous\u201d and \u201cbigger than Watergate.\u201d Clinton, the DOJ, Democrat Senators, and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champion\u2019s defection, calling the announcement \u201cappalling,\u201d \u201cabsurd,\u201d \u201cstrange,\u201d \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d an \u201cattack,\u201d and \u201cunprecedented.\u201d The bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to Trump\u2019s side and put him in the White House. \\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Comey\u2019s announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying. Not because it is \u201cunprecedented\u201d as the Democrats keep squealing. They had no such qualms when the weekend before the 1992 election, special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh indicted a poll-surging George H.W. Bush for his alleged involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal. No, the mystery is Comey\u2019s motives. Is Comey like Conrad\u2019s Lord Jim, now sacrificing his FBI career\u2013\u2013sure to be over if the notoriously vengeful Clinton is elected\u2013\u2013 to atone for having besmirched his office, reputation, and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist self-interest? Or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled FBI investigators? To quote one of our candidates, \u201cAt this point, what difference does it make?\u201d \\nThe real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters. Right now we don\u2019t know if the content of the 650,000 emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of Clinton vizier Huma Abedin, will reveal something damning like, say, classified materials. But we already know that Clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server, which didn\u2019t bother Comey back in July. So what could be in these new emails that rises above Comey\u2019s sophistic \u201cextreme carelessness,\u201d and reaches the statute\u2019s \u201cgross negligence\u201d? Or has Comey found new evidence of Hillary\u2019s \u201cintent,\u201d his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law? There had to be something that made Comey subject himself to the scorched-earth wrath of the Democrats. \\nWhatever is found on the Abedin laptop, one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters. They have shrugged off so many scandals, lies, and failures that should have sunk a candidacy, that it\u2019s hard to calculate what level of incompetence, unpleasantness, dishonesty, sleaze, and crime is disqualifying anymore. Here are the greatest hits from Hillary\u2019s catalogue: Whitewater Missing billing records from her tenure at the Rose Law Firm Renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to donors Travelgate Illegal possession of FBI files Conducting illegal secret meetings of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform Cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail Hounding the victims of her husband\u2019s sexual assaults and philandering Stealing $200,000 worth of china, furniture, and artwork from the White House Claiming she landed under \u201csniper fire\u201d in Bosnia Claiming she and Bill left the White House \u201cdead broke\u201d Shaking down Wall Street while assuring the Orcs of capitalism that she\u2019s got their back Charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides Calling 30,000 missing emails \u201cpersonal\u201d communications Lying about the Benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead Americans\u2019 families Supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure Internet video when she knew the same night that they weren\u2019t Perjuring herself before Congress and the FBI about the emails and her private server The disastrous overthrow of Ghaddafi in Libya The disastrous \u201creset\u201d with Russia The disastrous nuclear deal with Iran The disastrous withdrawal from Iraq The corrupt Clinton Foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary, the pay-to-play State Department Using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planet\u2019s most brutally misogynistic regimes Serially flip-flopping on issues like same-sex marriage, the Trans Pacific Trade deal, and the Keystone pipeline Promising to \u201craise taxes on the middle class\u201d and \u201cput coal miners out of work\u201d Her campaign staff\u2019s dirty tricks against Trump and his supporters Her campaign staff\u2019s incestuous relationship with the media Her staff\u2019s illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation Her strong support of gruesome late-term abortions And, last but not least, the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health \\nBack in the day, just a few of these gaffes, deceptions, and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for Congress, let alone the White House. \\nAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s offenses? He\u2019s talks exactly as you\u2019d expect a New York real estate developer, casino owner, reality television star, and beauty pageant mogul to talk He\u2019s condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what Bill Clinton and every White-House-visiting rapper, movie star, or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star they let you do it,\u201d as Trump bragged of his crude sexual advances He\u2019s ignorant of policy He doesn\u2019t understand the economics of global trade He doesn\u2019t know what the \u201cnuclear triad\u201d is He\u2019s addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives He wants to build a wall with Mexico He takes legal advantage of tax law He\u2019s not \u201csuitable\u201d for office He does not have the right \u201ctemperament\u201d He\u2019s used bankruptcy as a business tool He\u2019s accused of groping over a dozen women, including a polymorphously perverse porn star He\u2019s mean and insulting He has orange hair \\nIn short, Trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices. Just ask Hillary\u2019s various Secret Service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be. \\nThe voters will decide for themselves which candidate\u2019s catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous. But whatever happens, it\u2019s clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates. \\nThis transformation happened decades before Trump and Hillary came along. After Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the White House, his approval ratings were 73%. He left the White House with a 66% rating, higher than any president since Harry Truman, including Ronald Reagan. Think about it: the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the Soviet Union into its own dustbin of history. \\nThat was the inflection point for our political culture. No wonder that Barack Obama\u2019s lack of any real-world experience or achievement, left-wing views, self-confessed drug use, friends like the anti-American racist Jeremiah Wright and unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers, and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to 45 million voters. So why now are we shocked, shocked that off-brand candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying for the presidency? Decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue, wisdom, and decorum have already long gone. \\nSo absent a smoking howitzer in the next WikiLeaks dump, Comey\u2019s restart of the investigation, which in any case will take months to complete, will probably not be the game-changing October surprise many hope for and others dread, especially given a corrupt media\u2019s studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate. Then again, the rapid erosion of Hillary\u2019s support is drawing analogies to Reagan\u2019s late surge against Carter. \\nEither way, on November 8, most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions, and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like \u201ccares for people like me.\u201d Or they might just finally realize that Hillary\u2019s accumulated offenses are intolerable. But what that standard of selection will deliver is anybody\u2019s guess.'"}, "time": 1742563143.6246738}
