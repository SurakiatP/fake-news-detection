Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) said President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed wall between the U. S.  border was \u201ca sign of weakness. \u201d  Pelosi said, \u201cWhat is wrong with that scenario is the wall. He talks about how tall it is, who will pay for it, and all of the rest of that. You have to understand this part of the country there is a community with a border going through it. The president, I think, talking about this wall, is expressing a sign of weakness. He is saying I can\u2019t control our borders, I have to build a wall. We would certainly like to  \u2014   we have a responsibility to control our borders but building a wall is not an answer.
