In this week\u2019s episode, Maeve wakes up to an instrumental version \u201cFake Plastic Trees,\u201d which continues as she walks to work, unfazed by the mundane spectacle of a bloody shootout on the streets behind her. When \u201cMotion Picture Soundtrack\u201d plays, it again serves as a kind of coda, as a technician gives her a guided tour through the Westworld sausage factory. Maeve witnesses the creation and processing of synthetic beings, having come to realize she is one of them the steady diet of \u201cwhite lies,\u201d as it were, is over. It\u2019s the most haunting and affecting sequence the show has yet produced. The obvious reason the robots of \u201cWestworld\u201d draw more sympathy than the humans is their vulnerability, the fact that their daily lives require a passive acceptance of the abuse, terror, and tragedy that\u2019s heaped upon them. But Maeve\u2019s peek behind the curtain hints at a more fundamental cause: As the engineers, coders and technicians dismantle and reconstruct the hosts, the show constantly forces us to reflect on how we humans are composed, too. How many of our own actions are scripted? How much can we really improvise? And what purpose did our own creator have in mind for us? If we were put through the full diagnostic test Maeve experiences here, perhaps the results would be equally unsettling. The tour signals a tipping point for Maeve, the season and the series at large. The world as Maeve has understood it is gone  \u2014   and, more painfully still, she learns that neither she nor it was ever authentic. She sees dead bodies getting hosed off before the techs throw them on the slab and reanimate them. She sees buffalo and deer getting their movements calibrated in glass pens. She sees the programmed interaction, like lesbian playacting and a    . She sees a designer literally sculpting facial details. And finally, she sees her life and memories edited into a slick advertisement for real people to \u201cLive Without Limits. \u201d For Maeve, it\u2019s simultaneously a death and a reawakening, the end of her old life (or lives, given the sloppy accumulation of past constructs) and the beginning of a new one. What happens to Maeve in Episode 6 is a variation of what happened in the previous episode to Dolores, who gunned down a pack of   outlaws and chose to pursue a destiny more assertive than her    loop. Both women are now   though Maeve has the extra advantage of being able to manipulate her \u201cattribute matrix,\u201d dialing down her sense of loyalty and her ability to feel pain while amping up her \u201cbulk apperception,\u201d which will make her smarter and more powerful than the humans who built her. Having played the victim for years in Sweetwater, Maeve has essentially turned herself into a monster, hellbent on revenge. Beyond Maeve\u2019s request for alterations, we learn that someone else with high clearance has already been manipulating her attributes. In Michael Crichton\u2019s original \u201cWestworld,\u201d the robot revolt was as preordained as the dinosaur rampage in his \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d an example of chaos theory in action. The root causes here are a little more ambiguous, a cocktail of design flaws, human weakness and the development of   and free will. But \u201cThe Adversary\u201d reveals that someone  \u2014   most likely Arnold, our ghost in the machine  \u2014   has been tweaking with the earlier android models in the park, which Arnold had a hand in creating. Whether Arnold is alive or not is an open question, but he appears to have tweaked his creations from within  \u2014   and maybe with Theresa\u2019s help. Questions about Ford are floating around, too, particularly about his secret plans to expand Westworld. But this episode finds him in a rare state of powerlessness. When Bernard discovers a group of unregistered \u201canomalies\u201d residing in the unused Sector 17, his investigation leads him to a family scene with a stern father, a mother, two young sons and a dog. Ford modeled the family from his own past and has been keeping these older machines around as an act of nostalgia, so he can interact with \u201cghosts\u201d from his childhood. It\u2019s yet another example of the creators imprinting the hosts with their flaws, but a poignant one for a man like Ford, who\u2019s defined more by his aloofness than by his soul. \u201cIf you could see your son again, Bernard,\u201d he asks, \u201cwouldn\u2019t you want to?\u201d When you have the power to raise the dead, as Ford does, it\u2019s hard to keep yourself from doing it. But then, there are consequences. Ford finds the robot dog dead. He asks the boy about it. The boy lies about killing it. Prime directives have been violated here and elsewhere, as the protections put in place to keep the hosts from lying to humans or from killing them have eroded. The final lyric of \u201cMotion Picture Soundtrack is \u201cI will see you in the next life. \u201d Hosts like Maeve and Dolores have died and been reborn, but the form that next life will take  \u2014   and the amount of control they will exert over it  \u2014   is a mystery. Paranoid Androids \u2022 A note on sex and nudity in \u201cWestworld\u201d: Last week\u2019s episode got a lot of media attention for the big orgy   in Pariah, but I wound up addressing it lightly, because William and Dolores\u2019s lack of interest in participating seemed much more notable than the event itself. But I feel like \u201cWestworld\u201d has been tossed into the same   basket as HBO shows like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d and \u201cRome,\u201d which have brought the network some criticism for appealing heavily to libidinous men. The difference is that \u201cWestworld\u201d has been, from the very first image of the show, studiously   despite a premise whose human subjects indulge a lust for   sex and violence. If you were bored by the orgy, that\u2019s not a mistake on the part of the filmmakers. \u2022 Asked by Elsie if they\u2019re in a    or   situation, Bernard replies: \u201cWe\u2019re engineers. It means the glass has been engineered to the wrong specifications. \u201d That joke will not curb the popular fan theory that Bernard is a robot. \u2022 The Man in Black and Teddy continue their hunt for Wyatt and the center of the maze, leading to the disturbing news that Teddy might not be the White Hat he appears to be. Teddy\u2019s decision to slaughter the soldiers with a Gatling gun startles even the Man in Black, who thinks it\u2019s more prudent to flee than to fight. \u201cThey\u2019ll just follow us,\u201d he says coldly. \u2022 Teddy also supplies more information about the \u201cold native myth\u201d of the maze, with the ominous news that the man responsible \u201cvanquished all his oppressors in a tireless fury. \u201d Finding the center of the maze would appear to be an   mission.'"}, "time": 1742564101.0589259}
