Trump\u2019s blustery attacks on the press, complaints about the judicial system and bold claims of presidential power collectively sketch out a constitutional worldview that shows contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law, legal experts across the political spectrum say. Even as much of the Republican political establishment lines up behind its presumptive nominee, many conservative and libertarian legal scholars warn that electing Mr. Trump is a recipe for a constitutional crisis. \u201cWho knows what Donald Trump with a pen and phone would do?\u201d asked Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute. With five months to go before Election Day, Mr. Trump has already said he would \u201cloosen\u201d libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations. He has threatened to sic federal regulators on his critics. He has encouraged rough treatment of demonstrators. His proposal to bar Muslims from entry into the country tests the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of religious freedom, due process and equal protection. And, in what was a tipping point for some, he attacked Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel of the Federal District Court in San Diego, who is overseeing two class actions against Trump University. Mr. Trump accused the judge of bias, falsely said he was Mexican and seemed to issue a threat. \u201cThey ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cO. K.? But we will come back in November. Wouldn\u2019t that be wild if I am president and come back and do a civil case?\u201d David Post, a retired law professor who now writes for the Volokh Conspiracy, a   law blog, said those comments had crossed a line. \u201cThis is how authoritarianism starts, with a president who does not respect the judiciary,\u201d Mr. Post said. \u201cYou can criticize the judicial system, you can criticize individual cases, you can criticize individual judges. But the president has to be clear that the law is the law and that he enforces the law. That is his constitutional obligation. \u201d \u201cIf he is signaling that that is not his position, that\u2019s a very serious constitutional problem,\u201d Mr. Post said. Beyond the attack on judicial independence is a broader question of Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to the separation of powers and to the principles of federalism enshrined in the Constitution. Randy E. Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown and an architect of the first major challenge to President Obama\u2019s health care law, said he had grave doubts on both fronts. \u201cYou would like a president with some idea about constitutional limits on presidential powers, on congressional powers, on federal powers,\u201d Professor Barnett said, \u201cand I doubt he has any awareness of such limits. \u201d Republican leaders say they are confident that Mr. Trump would respect the rule of law if elected. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a White House counsel,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told Hugh Hewitt, the radio host, on Monday. \u201cThere will be others who point out there\u2019s certain things you can do and you can\u2019t do. \u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has become a reluctant supporter of Mr. Trump, said he did not believe that the nation would be in danger under his presidency. \u201cI still believe we have the institutions of government that would restrain someone who seeks to exceed their constitutional obligations,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cWe have a Congress. We have the Supreme Court. We\u2019re not Romania. \u201d \u201cOur institutions, including the press, are still strong enough to prevent\u201d unconstitutional acts, he said. Mr. Post said that view was too sanguine, given the executive branch\u2019s practical primacy. \u201cThe president has all the power with respect to enforcing the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one of those three branches that actually has the guns in its hands, and that\u2019s the executive. \u201d Republican officials have criticized Mr. Obama for what they have called his unconstitutional expansion of executive power. But some legal scholars who share that view say the problem under a President Trump would be worse. \u201cI don\u2019t think he cares about separation of powers at all,\u201d said Richard Epstein, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who also teaches at New York University and the University of Chicago. President George W. Bush \u201coften went beyond what he should have done,\u201d Professor Epstein said. \u201cI think Obama\u2019s been much worse on that issue pretty consistently, and his underlings have been even more so. But I think Trump doesn\u2019t even think there\u2019s an issue to worry about. He just simply says whatever I want to do I will do. \u201d Mr. Trump has boasted that he will use Mr. Obama\u2019s actions as precedent for his own expansive assertions of executive power. \u201cHe\u2019s led the way, to be honest with you,\u201d he said in January on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s program to spare millions of immigrants in the country unlawfully from deportation. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to use them much better, and they\u2019re going to serve a much better purpose than what he\u2019s done. \u201d But Mr. Post said there was a difference between Mr. Obama\u2019s view of executive power and that of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhatever you think of Obama\u2019s position on immigration, he is willing to submit to the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no suggestion that he will disobey if the courts rule against him. \u201d Several law professors said they were less sure about Mr. Trump, citing the actions of another populist, President Andrew Jackson, who refused to enforce an 1832 Supreme Court decision arising from a clash between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation. \u201cI can easily see a situation in which he would take the Andrew Jackson line,\u201d Professor Epstein said, referring to a probably apocryphal comment attributed to Jackson about Chief Justice John Marshall: \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it. \u201d There are other precedents, said John C. Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who took an expansive view of executive power as a lawyer in the Bush administration. \u201cThe only two other presidents I can think of who were so hostile to judges on an individual level and to the judiciary as a whole would be Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt,\u201d he said. Both of those presidents chafed at what they saw as excessive judicial power. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t doing it because they had cases before those judges as individuals,\u201d Professor Yoo said. \u201cThey had legitimate    fights between the presidency and the judiciary. Trump is lashing out because he has a lawsuit in a private capacity, which is much more disturbing. \u201d Other legal scholars said they were worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to the First Amendment. He has taken particular aim at The Washington Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. \u201cHe owns Amazon,\u201d Mr. Trump said in February. \u201cHe wants political influence so Amazon will benefit from it. That\u2019s not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems. They\u2019re going to have such problems. \u201d More generally, Mr. Trump has discussed revising libel laws to make it easier to sue over critical coverage. \u201cI\u2019m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\u201d Mr. Trump said in February. \u201cWe\u2019re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\u2019re totally protected. \u201d On one hand, Mr. Trump seemed to misunderstand the scope of presidential power. Libel is a   tort constrained by First Amendment principles, and a president\u2019s views do not figure in its application. On the other hand, said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments betrayed a troubling disregard for free expression. \u201cThere are very few serious constitutional thinkers who believe public figures should be able to use libel as indiscriminately as Trump seems to think they should,\u201d Professor Somin said. \u201cHe poses a serious threat to the press and the First Amendment. \u201d Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements about legal issues were extemporaneous and resist conventional legal analysis. Some seemed to betray ignorance of fundamental legal concepts, as when he said in a debate that Senator Ted Cruz of Texas had criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s sister, a federal appeals court judge, \u201cfor signing a certain bill,\u201d adding for good measure that Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. while still an appeals court judge, had also \u201csigned that bill. \u201d But bills are legislative rather than judicial documents. And, as it happened, Judge Alito had not joined the opinion in question. Asked on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in March about whom he would name to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump said he would \u201cprobably appoint people that would look very seriously at\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cemail disaster because it\u2019s criminal activity. \u201d In the constitutional structure, however, Supreme Court justices are neither investigators nor prosecutors. When Mr. Trump recently released a list of his potential Supreme Court nominees, conservative and libertarian scholars were heartened, but only to a point. \u201cIt was a tremendous list, a great list,\u201d said Mr. Shapiro, from the Cato Institute. \u201cWho knows how much you can trust the list?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563225.5683641}
