The case was dropped, but the theatre\u2019s head was sacked. \\nRossiya-24 state television reported the decision to close Lloyd Webber\u2019s \u201clegendary rock opera\u201d was most likely taken by the theatre \u201cfearing to repeat the fate\u201d of the Tannhauser staging. \\nThe musical was first staged in Russia in 1990 during Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika reforms. \\nRussia made offending religious believers a criminal offence after the Pussy Riot punk band performed a song slamming President Vladimir Putin in a Moscow church in 2012.'"}, "time": 1742562067.7675211}
