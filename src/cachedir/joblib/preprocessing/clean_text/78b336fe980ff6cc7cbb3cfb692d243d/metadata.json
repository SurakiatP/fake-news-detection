Walsh: \u2018I\u2019m Grabbing My Musket\u2019 \\nJoe Walsh is a stain on the history of my little part of the country. He served for a blessedly short time before being demolished by Representative Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) in the 2012 election, but he still has ardent supporters around here. He\u2019s relatively well-known for his outrageous tweets, but this one, posted on October 26, made some real waves: On November 8th, I\\'m voting for Trump. \\nOn November 9th, if Trump loses, I\\'m grabbing my musket. \\nYou in? \\n\u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 \\nWow. \\nI will grant that a musket is not going to do you much good these days. So perhaps, PERHAPS, it was a metaphor. \\nBut what does this say to the droves of Trump supporters, armed with much more than a musket, who believe the election will be stolen from their anointed one? \\nWalsh, facing both harsh criticism and hilarious jabs on Twitter for his comment, did not back down: I\\'m serious. I don\\'t think a musket would do much good these days, but it\\'s time for civil disobedience on the right. https://t.co/ThJPEbALWZ \\n\u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 \\nYahoo! News interviewed Walsh about the comment, and he said : \u201cI\u2019m not talking about inciting violence. I\u2019m saying, \u2018If Trump loses, man, game on, grab your musket. We\u2019re going to protest. We\u2019re going to boycott. We\u2019re going to picket. We\u2019re going to march on Washington. We\u2019re going to stop paying taxes. We\u2019re going to practice civil disobedience.\u2019 Whatever it takes.\u201d \\nThis has become the standard operating procedure of Republicans, particularly Trump-supporting Republicans. Make veiled threats and then walk them back (\u201cAww, c\u2019mon, I was kidding! Can\u2019t you guys take a joke?\u201d), but make sure the knuckle-draggers who support them get wind of it. It\u2019s disgusting. \\nThis morning, Walsh tweeted: I told Thomas Jefferson gov forced a baker out of biz for defending her religious beliefs. \\n\"Can\\'t happen here\" he said. \"Grab your musket!\" \\n\u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 27, 2016 \\nWhile this tweet is asinine on so many levels, it also suggests that he wasn\u2019t speaking metaphorically in his initial tweet. After all, in Jefferson\u2019s time, muskets were one of the weapons of choice. Walsh Is A Disgrace \\nLanguage like this has no place in political discourse. If Walsh were nothing more than the radio host he currently is, it would be disgusting. Given that he used to be a representative in the United States Congress, it is downright abhorrent. \\nIt\u2019s also not the first time Walsh has suggested violence. \\nAfter the shooting of several police officers in Dallas this summer, Walsh tweeted \u2014 and later deleted \u2014 the following: Screenshot via Chicago Tribune \\nSo it\u2019s really not out of the question to think he\u2019s actually looking to incite violence with his \u201cgrabbing my musket\u201d comment. \\nI\u2019m just happy his Congressional office is no longer sullying the quaint town square. \\nWatch Don Lemon take Walsh to task for his Dallas tweet here: \\nFeatured image via screenshot from YouTube video About Carrie MacDonald \\nCarrie is a progressive mom and wife living in the upper Midwest.
