The case before the justices was brought by Miami after the 2008 financial crisis. The city said that discriminatory mortgage lending practices by Bank of America and Wells Fargo had led to a disproportionate number of defaults by minority home buyers and, in turn, to financial harm to the city. \u201cWe are aggrieved in every sense of the word by the discrimination that was propounded here,\u201d said Robert S. Peck, a lawyer for the city. The justices appeared divided over whether Miami\u2019s asserted injuries were enough to allow it to sue under the housing law. Justice Elena Kagan said the law was a \u201cdistinctive kind of   statute, which really is focusing on community harms. \u201d \u201cHere the cities are standing up and saying, \u2018Every time you do this redlining and this reverse redlining, essentially a community is becoming blighted.\u2019 And who better than the city to recognize that interest and to assert it?\u201d she asked. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. appeared to disagree, telling Mr. Peck that the harms Miami claimed to have suffered were secondhand. \u201cYour injuries are derivative of the injury to the homeowners who had the subprime mortgages and who suffered the foreclosure and so on,\u201d the chief justice told him. \u201cI understand your argument that you\u2019re down the line, but I don\u2019t see how you can say that your loss of property taxes is a direct injury. \u201d Justice Anthony M. Kennedy also appeared skeptical of aspects of the city\u2019s arguments. \u201cThe statute doesn\u2019t prohibit decreasing property tax values,\u201d he said. Other justices worried that a ruling for Miami would allow all sorts of people and entities to sue for indirect harm from discriminatory practices. Justice Kagan asked about restaurants and dry cleaners, Justice Sonia Sotomayor about corner grocers and Justice Stephen G. Breyer about \u201ca magazine that writes about successes in integration and wants to write about this community before it got wrecked or whatever. \u201d Curtis E. Gannon, a lawyer for the federal government arguing in support of the city, offered a limiting principle. He said people, businesses and local governments hurt by a decline in property values ought to be able to sue under the housing law. The law allows suits from \u201caggrieved persons. \u201d No one disputed that cities may sometimes count as persons in a legal sense, but Neal K. Katyal, a lawyer for the banks, said Miami was not aggrieved just because it asserted an indirect financial injury. He said the city had tried to piggyback on the borrowers\u2019 interest in being free from discrimination and had \u201ccut and paste\u201d their grievances into its lawsuit. Miami\u2019s asserted injuries were too remote, Mr. Katyal said, calling the city\u2019s legal theory \u201c  liability. \u201d \u201cYou have to have discriminatory loans,\u201d he said. \u201cThose discriminatory loans have to lead to defaults. The defaults have to lead to foreclosures. The foreclosures need to lead to increases in vacancies. The increase in vacancies needs to lead to reduction in property values. \u201d Mr. Peck, the city\u2019s lawyer, said its harm was more direct. \u201cThe banks\u2019 practice of providing minority borrowers with more expensive and riskier loans than they qualified for, or that nonminority borrowers received, actually frustrated and counteracted the city\u2019s efforts on fair housing,\u201d he said. The court heard a single hour of argument in two consolidated cases, Bank of America v. Miami, No.   and Wells Fargo v. Miami, No.  . A trial court dismissed the suits in 2014, saying the city had not demonstrated that its claims were covered by the housing law. The United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, reversed those rulings last year, allowing the cases to proceed. The appeals court said it was enough for the city to contend that it had \u201csuffered an economic injury resulting from a racially discriminatory housing policy. \u201d A   tie in the Supreme Court, which seemed a viable prospect on Tuesday, would leave the appeals court\u2019s ruling in place, handing a victory to Miami but setting no national precedent.'"}, "time": 1742563168.744407}
