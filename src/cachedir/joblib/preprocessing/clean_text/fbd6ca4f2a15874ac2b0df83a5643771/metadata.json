Many cities issued new marching orders: no solo patrols. No officers should be alone. In Burlington, Vt. during roll call, some officers blinked away tears. In Los Angeles, the chief did the same. In the break room at a Manhattan precinct house, officers  \u2014   behind closed doors, comfortable among themselves  \u2014   debated what they saw on the videos of the recent fatal police shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota. Some said race had played a role. Others, one officer said, \u201cput on blinders. \u201d A rookie officer in Manhattan, five days on the job, texted her mother on Friday. She was on her way to work at a protest. A protest against the police. And a Queens detective quietly seethed. \u201cThis is insanity,\u201d said the detective, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to do so publicly. \u201cIt\u2019s just freaking horrendous. \u201d Reactions to Thursday\u2019s deadly ambush in Dallas swept through   rooms and squad cars in police departments across the country. Contempt for the shooter was universal. But behind it followed other, varying observations about what it means to be a police officer in 2016, with the attending fears and frustrations, and amid a seemingly growing gulf between the police and the policed. \u201cWe have broken into tribes,\u201d Charlie Beck, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, told a class of cadets who graduated on Friday. \u201cAll of a sudden it becomes more important who your parents are, what the color of your skin is, than whether you are American. \u201d \u201cThis is not about black lives, or brown lives or blue lives,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is about America. \u201d Police culture all but forbids one officer from publicly criticizing or   the actions of others. For that reason, officers interviewed on Friday would not comment directly on the videos taken during and immediately after the shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota. But one fact was clear: When a new video showing what appears to be police misconduct surfaces, it affects officers everywhere. \u201cOne of the worries that cops have is that no cop can control what another cop does, but all cops will be judged by what the other cop does,\u201d Chief Brandon del Pozo of the Burlington Police Department said. \u201cWe\u2019ll sit there in the   room, watching police videos all over the country, trying to make sense of what we\u2019re seeing and trying to make sure we\u2019re doing the best job we can. \u201d There is much to watch. \u201cAny time there is a traffic stop made, the cellphones come out,\u201d said George Hofstetter, president of the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. \u201cThe people taking them out have nothing to do with the incident, but they feel the need to videotape it. It\u2019s like they think, \u2018I am not going to stand across the street, I am going to become part of the problem. \u2019\u201d Chief del Pozo echoed that thought. \u201cOn top of all the legitimate issues in policing,\u201d he said, \u201cstreet cops worry that there are people looking to foment confrontation to generate the next headline in situations where people just sort of complied before. \u201d Officers, privately, do not march in lock step after watching videos, the Queens detective said. \u201cThere are people that are like, \u2018Oh, the cop\u2019s right,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those people. It is what it is. \u201d But he said he had often perceived a rush to judgment after the release of a video and \u201cthe fanning of the emotions. \u201d Officer Pedro Serrano, a   veteran of the New York Police Department, said that as a Hispanic he could sympathize with the anger felt by members of minority groups after shootings like those in Louisiana and Minnesota. \u201cGrowing up, I hated the police,\u201d he said. \u201cThey abused me for no reason. It\u2019s just because I was in the neighborhood and a person of color. \u201d It was in the break room at his precinct house on Friday that officers debated what was on the videos. \u201cI work with people who are afraid of people of color, they jump with conclusions,\u201d Officer Serrano said in an interview. \u201cWhen you take that   into policing you can make very bad decisions. \u201d At the same time, he said that he worried, particularly in light of the killing of the five officers in Dallas, that anger at the police could push some people to take things too far. \u201cEverything that happened recently is not going to be good for us because they\u2019re going to basically say all cops are bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that they, the people who go over the top with the protesting, I know they don\u2019t see me for who I am. They see my uniform. \u201d Another New York City detective, based in the Bronx, said he was not an apologist for officers committing wrongdoing. He said he had not seen the latest videos, but added that such footage was rarely, if ever, complete. \u201cI\u2019ve been there when cops have shot perps,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything happens so quickly and you have just a moment to life or death, to living or not getting up tomorrow, or your partner being dead. It\u2019s so much easier when you can watch a video over and over. It\u2019s one thing to be in the safety of your own living room or watching on your electronic device, to being there. \u201d The emotional whiplash on Thursday  \u2014   police officers branded as villains, and then seen as victims, in a span of seconds  \u2014   recalled New York City in 2014, when a gunman claiming to be motivated by anger at the police ambushed two officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, in their patrol car in Brooklyn. Yet, for some, the events leading up to the shootings in Dallas seemed without precedent. For Officer Joe Nocella, a   veteran of the Nassau County Police Department, those killings signified the start of a new era in policing. \u201cSniper fire against a police officer,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that too many cops across the country could have put a thought in their head that something like this could happen. \u201d Veteran officers suggested otherwise. Some remembered wearing their uniforms in the 1960s with a fear of assassination by militant attackers. \u201cI came on the job in the late \u201970s, and that was still fresh on everyone\u2019s mind,\u201d Edward Davis, a former Boston police commissioner, said. \u201cWe then moved to a much better place. But now some of those feelings have crept back in the conversation. \u201d The Bronx detective put it more bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a bad time to be a cop in this city,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cops before me, in the 1970s? They had homegrown terrorists ambushing cops. You had the Weather Underground building bombs to blow up police stations. You had antiwar protesters throwing Molotov cocktails at cops. \u201d Though he has long worked in a detective\u2019s suit and tie, he said he would not hesitate to leave his home in uniform. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my uniform,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d wear it anytime, anywhere. \u201d The Queens detective said that feeling like a target was natural to men and women in uniform. \u201cYou should always have it in the back of your mind,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody comes to work thinking, \u2018I\u2019m the guy who gets killed today.\u2019 But everyone knows that\u2019s the risk. \u201d The events in Dallas heightened that sense. \u201cThat they could literally be hunted,\u201d the Queens detective said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened. Like a hunter in a tree stand with a gun, lying in wait to shoot prey. \u201d On Staten Island, a commanding officer said he would make a special announcement at his afternoon roll call: \u201cBe safe. Be vigilant out there. \u201d In Times Square, a uniformed officer watched traffic on Seventh Avenue. \u201cPeople want to get angry and everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to keep doing what we do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628502.5852041}
