Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson speaks during a campaign rally at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa. First it was Bernie Sanders. Now it\u2019s Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein being sized up by many young people. With a day to go, Hillary Clinton has struggled to convince young voters that she deserves their support. \\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Although some indicators suggest the 2016 presidential election could be closer than initially expected, prominent third-party candidates are urging voters not to waver in their support for options outside the traditional two-party system. \\nAlternatives to the Democrat and Republican nominees, such as the Green Party\u2019s Dr. Jill Stein and former Gov. Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, received unprecedented attention in this election cycle as dissatisfaction with the two major candidates soared to unprecedented highs. \\nBut third parties traditionally struggle to hold the public\u2019s interest as Election Day approaches , with many voters eventually falling in line with one of the two major parties. While some polls previously suggested a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton, others are now showing a tighter than expected race , which could also scare off some potential third-party voters. \\nA RealClearPolitics analysis of polls which include all four candidates, which was last updated on Wednesday, suggested Johnson would net about 4.1 percent of the popular vote and Stein could get as much as 2.1 percent. \\nIf either candidate can net 5 percent of the popular vote on Nov. 8, they\u2019ll unlock up to $10 million in additional federal funding for future elections. That money could unleash more political power by enabling the Greens or Libertarians to reach more potential voters. \\nWhile some polls indicate that Johnson\u2019s unprecedented support is fading in the eleventh hour before the election, Johnson tweeted on Thursday that his support was especially strong among voters who identify as independent.

Gary Johnson (@GovGaryJohnson) November 3, 2016 \\nIn an online poll of 601 likely voters who identify as independents, Bloomberg Politics found that 19 percent support Johnson and 8 percent support Stein. \\nIn an Oct. 31 tweet, Stein urged voters to make a \u201cstrategic\u201d vote and go Green.

Encouraging her supporters to push for 5 percent of the vote, Stein continued: \u201cAs corporate, mainstream political pundits scoff at and attack my \u2018unlikely\u2019 candidacy, we have been traveling throughout the country, talking with people from all walks of life and organizing on the ground with a fast-growing base of support from \u2018unlikely\u2019 voters: millennials, indebted students, poor and working class people, immigrants, people of color, and many others who have given up on the two establishment parties out of disgust and frustration.\u201d \\nGreen Party backers have also used the hashtag #InvestYourVote on Twitter to encourage voters to take a long-term view of the potential effectiveness of voting for a third-party candidate: \"Fear of Donald Trump is not enough for me to support Clinton, with her record of corruption.\" \\n\u2014 Green Party US (@GreenPartyUS) November 1, 2016 \\nOn Oct. 31, Stein and Johnson faced off in a televised debate hosted by PBS\u2019 Tavis Smiley, marking an unusually mainstream forum for the candidates. During the program, the pair reacted to the renewed FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails and other recent developments in this often stressful election . Watch \u201c Dr. Jill Stein and Former Gov. Gary Johnson : \u201d \\nAnother alternative candidate receiving an unusual level of attention in the lead-up to Election Day is Evan McMullin, an independent from Utah who formerly served as a CIA operative and as a policy advisor to Congress. Polls and electoral analysts have even suggested McMullin has a chance of winning an electoral vote in the state, where some members of the Church of Latter Day Saints see him as a conservative alternative to Republican candidate Donald Trump. \\nOn Oct. 29, one of McMullin\u2019s tweets went viral after Trump told Fox News that he\u2019d \u201cnever heard of\u201d McMullin and accused him of being a \u201cpuppet\u201d of Bill Kristol, the neoconservative founding editor of The Weekly Standard. \\nIn a response which has been retweeted over 18,000 times, McMullin fired back: \u201cYes you\u2019ve never heard of me because while you were harassing women at beauty pageants, I was fighting terrorists abroad.\u201d . @realDonaldTrump , Yes you\u2019ve never heard of me because while you were harassing women at beauty pageants, I was fighting terrorists abroad. https://t.co/hNDTWn3HPN \\n\u2014 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) October 30, 2016 Be Sociable, Share!'"}, "time": 1742628546.7289956}
