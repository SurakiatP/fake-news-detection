The year saw the eruption of peaceful anti-regime protests on the island. \\nLondon has been under fire by international rights organizations for selling military equipment to Manama, which is involved in a harsh and deadly crackdown on opposition activists. \\nIt was reported late last month that the UK will open a massive permanent military base in Bahrain and deploy warships to the Persian Gulf.
