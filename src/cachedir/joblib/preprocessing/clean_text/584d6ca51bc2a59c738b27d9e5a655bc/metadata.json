What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 The surprise election of Donald J. Trump, a real estate    television star with no government experience, upended the political order in the United States and around the world. Global markets stabilized after an initial plunge. But uncertainty over Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, his embrace of the kind of white populism rising in Europe, and his distrust of trade pacts and climate change, raised international concerns. _____ \u2022 Mr. Trump marshaled   white and   voters disaffected by globalization and multiculturalism, waging a campaign that traded in derision and attacked the legitimacy of the political process. Both Hillary Clinton and President Obama were stung by the voters\u2019 repudiation, but reinforced the importance of a peaceful, orderly transition of power. Mrs. Clinton, who said the loss was \u201cpainful, and it will be for a long time,\u201d also insisted that the nation owed Mr. Trump \u201can open mind and a chance to lead. \u201d _____ \u2022 One party, the Republicans, will now control the White House and both houses of Congress, setting the stage for sweeping policy changes. The stunning outcome was unforeseen, undercutting the credibility of much of the American news media. Like the \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum, much of the polling, analysis and prominent coverage failed to capture the level of popular fury or foresee the coming revolt against the interests of what the British politician Nigel Farage derided as \u201cbig business and big politics. \u201d _____ \u2022 Both Russia and China have portrayed the tumultuous American election as a validation of their own authoritarian approaches. Vladimir V. Putin expressed hope for a \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d with Mr. Trump, whose lack of foreign policy experience and friendly positions toward Russia could play into the Kremlin\u2019s hands. Asia greeted the election cautiously. China sent a short congratulatory note, but made no mention of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to confront it on trade and currency issues. Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, could meet with the   as early as next week. \u2022 Newspapers across the globe scrambled to create front pages that conveyed the stunning upset. [The New York Times] \u2022 If Mr. Trump scraps the   Trade Partnership, a proper counterweight to China\u2019s expansion may never emerge. [The Straits Times] \u2022 Asian analysts fear that Mr. Trump will overhaul bilateral defense pacts with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia. [Nikkei Asian Review] \u2022 Mr. Trump has said he will \u201cend forever\u201d the use of the   visa that is employed by American companies to hire skilled workers from India and other countries. [Times of India] \u2022 Weeks before the election, President Rodrigo Duterte named Mr. Trump\u2019s business partner in Manila as a special envoy to the United States. [The New York Times] \u2022 Silicon Valley\u2019s reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory was beyond grim. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do enough,\u201d said one tech leader. [The New York Times] \u2022  California and Massachusetts legalized recreational marijuana use, reflecting a national shift in attitudes toward the drug. [The New York Times] \u2022 The one American institution that predicted Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency: \u201cThe Simpsons. \u201d [Entertainment Weekly] \u2022 The markets have recovered from a wild ride, with stocks trading higher in the U. S. and in early trading in Asia. Gold pared earlier gains. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 The Mexican peso took a beating, dropping more than 12 percent against the dollar before recovering to 8 percent. \u2022 In other news, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India arrives in Japan today for a   visit during which the two countries may complete negotiations on a nuclear energy deal. \u2022 Disney reports quarterly results today, which could offer a look into the performance of the massive new resort it opened in Shanghai this year. \u2022 In Hong Kong, highly competitive \u201ccramming centers\u201d for exam preparations are turning their tutors into celebrities, plastering their faces on buses and billboards. \u2022 Sharbat Gula, the   Afghan who appeared as a girl on a National Geographic cover, was welcomed home by Afghanistan\u2019s president after Pakistan deported her. She has come to symbolize the plight of hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees and migrants being forced to return. \u2022 President Xi Jinping\u2019s attitudes toward law and sovereignty were apparent in China\u2019s decision to target two   politicians in Hong Kong who used the term \u201c \u201d in taking their oaths of office. \u2022 At least seven people died and dozens were injured when a tram derailed south of London. The cause was unclear, but the driver was arrested. \u2022 Roughly 50, 000 years ago, the Neanderthals and modern humans encountered one another and interbred. So why didn\u2019t a   hybrid prevail? Two new studies focus on this question and find that a principle of population genetics applies: In small populations, natural selection is less effective. We recently told you how autumn  \u2014   or is it fall?  \u2014   got its identity crisis. But what about summer, spring and winter? Where do their names come from? Etymologists link \u201cwinter\u201d to the    word wed, meaning \u201cwater. \u201d That gave way to the old German wintar, or \u201cthe wet season. \u201d Water also leads us to the source of spring\u2019s name. In this case, the word was a verb before it was a noun. In the Middle Ages, \u201csprinc\u201d was German for \u201cleap\u201d and it came to mean \u201csource of water. \u201d Eventually \u201cspringing time\u201d replaced the Old English \u201clent,\u201d which had signified the entire spring season, not just the period from Ash Wednesday to Easter. It shrank down to \u201cspringtime,\u201d then \u201cspring. \u201d And while autumn now has two names, summer may originally have had none at all. Thousands of years ago, early   cultures are thought to have divided the year into just three seasons. At some point, the Sanskrit \u201cs\u00e1ma,\u201d or \u201cseason,\u201d appears to have traveled north from the Indian subcontinent  \u2014   a place that knows a thing or two about sweltering months  \u2014   and became summer. P. S.: The storied firearm we told you about in our Back Story on Wednesday  \u2014   an 18th century musket made for the Qianlong emperor  \u2014   was sold by the Sotheby\u2019s auction house to a private collector for more than $2. 4 million. Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help.
