[In a bizarre twist, however, the Chinese government denied any projects planned for the Scarborough Shoal and distanced itself from the   Hainan Daily newspaper report claiming otherwise.  That regional newspaper reported that Sansha City mayor Xiao Jie had announced new development projects in the Scarborough Shoal, including a new monitoring station. The Philippine Star notes that \u201cSansha\u201d is a name typically used for a number of islands and shoals within Philippine and Vietnamese sovereign territory, including the Spratly Islands and the Scarborough Shoal. The newspaper adds that China has controlled the Scarborough Shoal since 2012 and not handed it over after the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague issued a ruling in the Philippines\u2019 favor on the territorial dispute. While the Star identifies the Hainan Daily as a state newspaper, the Chinese government has denied the report. \u201cWe have checked with relevant authorities that the recent reports about building an environmental monitoring station on Huangyan Dao are false. There is no such a thing,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cChina places great importance on its relationship with the Philippines and cherishes the sound momentum   relations are enjoying now. \u201d The loudest protests to the Hainan Daily report came from Philippine legal authorities. Justice Minister Vitaliano Aguirre said Tuesday that the government was planning to lodge a formal protest against China for any construction in the region, a case that Aguirre predicted would be \u201cfairly strong. \u201d Aguirre added that his country was \u201cstrengthening the relationship with the United States\u201d in response to China\u2019s reported move. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio also weighed in, stating that, if the report is true, \u201cthe least the President should do\u201d was file an official complaint. Carpio has previously threatened to impeach Duterte if he did not adequately defend the territorial integrity of the Philippines against China\u2019s expansionist moves in the region. Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella took a more conciliatory tone, merely stating that President Rodrigo Duterte \u201chas repeatedly asserted that the Philippines is not giving up its claims and our entitlements over the area. \u201d Acting Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo told reporters that the Philippines was waiting for an official government statement before deciding how to respond. \u201cWe\u2019ll be awaiting a reply from China before we consider what to do next  \u2026     All we can really do is wait for China\u2019s clarification,\u201d he said. Manalo added that the Philippines was \u201cmaintaining a regular and close watch\u201d over the area. President Duterte himself issued a statement on Thursday local time (Wednesday in the United States) acknowledging Hua\u2019s denial. \u201cI was informed that they are not going to do anything at Panatag [Scarborough Shoal] out of respect for our friendship,\u201d he told reporters. \u201c\u2018We will build nothing there\u2019  \u2014   that was the assurance given by the Chinese government. \u201d China, he added \u201chas a word of honour. \u201d Duterte\u2019s conciliatory attitude towards the report comes after a weekend in which the Philippine president announced his desire to work with the Trump administration in America, promising to \u201cgive all, whatever it is\u201d to the United States except for a military alliance against China. A recent poll of Philippine nationals found that Duterte\u2019s hesitance to confront China on the nation\u2019s territorial integrity was wildly unpopular, as 84 percent of respondents said they wanted the government to \u201cuphold its rights in the disputed waters\u201d in the South China Sea.'"}, "time": 1742563165.371489}
