[\u201c \u201d is currently on display in Wittenberg, Germany, a town which has close ties to Protestant figure Martin Luther, and was created by the Evangelical Church in Hesse and Nassau, according to the Mirror.   \u201cIt consists of a metal box with a touch screen, two arms on the side, a head with eyes and a digital mouth at the top,\u201d the Mirror explained. \u201cAfter the robot wishes users a \u2018warm welcome,\u2019 it asks them if they want to be blessed by a male or female voice. It then asks the believer \u2018what blessing do you want,\u2019 which results in the robot making a mechanical sound as it raises its arms to the heavens and starts to smile. \u201d \u201cLights then start to flash in the robot\u2019s arms as it says \u2018God bless and protect you\u2019 and recites a biblical verse,\u201d the Mirror continued. \u201cAfter the blessing, the user has the possibility to print the dictum,\u201d similar to a fortune teller machine. The robot can communicate with users in five different languages, and the blessing can be printed out for them to take with them as well. Church spokesman Sebastian von Gehren claims that the new machine has attracted those who have very little in common with the church, but now routinely visit \u201cevery morning and evening\u201d to receive an automated blessing. \u201cIt is an experiment that is supposed to inspire discussion,\u201d he declared. \u201cOne half thinks it\u2019s great  \u2026     the other cannot imagine a blessing from a machine. \u201d Despite his praise of the robot, von Gehren added, \u201cThe machine should not replace the blessing of a pastor. \u201d \u201cIn the future, there will not be a blessing robot in every church,\u201d he concluded.
