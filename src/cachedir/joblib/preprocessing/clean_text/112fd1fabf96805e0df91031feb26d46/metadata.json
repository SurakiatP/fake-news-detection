[Mya Berry, a senior, says the fact that President James Madison inherited slaves, along with his Montpelier plantation, from his father means her school  \u2014   which, like the city of Madison, Wisconsin, is named after the fourth U. S. president  \u2014   is hostile to black students, reports the Capital Times.  In a change. org petition, which currently has nearly 1, 500 supporters, Berry states: The significance of this name in association with my school has a negative effect on memorials black students. The lack of representation I feel in this school makes me feel more than unsafe. I do not feel supported by the majority of staff at memorial, especially considering the fact that I\u2019ve gotten called n word multiple times, along with having an individual threaten me by telling me they would lynch me. Berry continues in her petition that when race is discussed at school, she is \u201ctold my perspective is just an opinion, and not anything valid to take into consideration. \u201d \u201cWith all the injustice I and others face in James Madison Memorial High School, do you truly think it\u2019s appropriate to glorify a man that enslaved my ancestors?\u201d she writes, adding that another reason to remove Madison\u2019s name from the school is the \u201ceducation disparity\u201d between white and black students. Berry also told the Capital Times she has never reported incidents in which she was allegedly threatened because she did not feel comfortable doing so. She also said the incidents did not happen over the course of the current school year. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t feel safe. I didn\u2019t know who to reach out to. Now that I\u2019m a senior and I\u2019ve become more comfortable speaking out, I\u2019ve told more people about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like faculty overhear injustice and they know it\u2019s wrong. Some of them don\u2019t speak up, and that adds to the unsafe environment. \u201d James Madison High principal Jay Affeldt said he was unaware of Berry\u2019s issues. \u201cI have met and will continue to meet with Ms. Berry and other student leaders to discuss how we can best move forward to have this dialog as a larger school community in a safe and healthy way,\u201d he told the Capital Times. \u201cAlso, I do not believe the specific incidents mentioned in the petition were ever reported to school staff, and I am trying to learn more about these incidents from Ms. Berry. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that every student feels safe, and we take all reports of hurtful behavior very seriously,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562087.438847}
