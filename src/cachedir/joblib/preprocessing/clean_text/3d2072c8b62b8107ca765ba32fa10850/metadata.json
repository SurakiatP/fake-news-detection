Then there is the fact that Hillary Clinton will not be president. And Mike Pence, the faithfully conservative vice   is there to keep watch. Those conservatives who insisted that electing Donald J. Trump president would be a grievous mistake  \u2014   a group that included governors, senators, radio hosts, prominent columnists and some of the most savvy political operators in the country  \u2014   are now saying they see an upside to four years of a Trump White House. But even as they find small reassurances, those who counted themselves part of the Trump opposition are wondering what their place will be for the next four years in a Republican Party they can hardly recognize. And they have begun to ponder what it all means for a conservative movement they thought they understood better. \u201cOh God,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, the Wisconsin radio host who became a vocal opponent of Mr. Trump\u2019s during the Republican primaries. He was describing how he had arrived at peace with the election results then, he said, he realized that he had not done so at all. \u201cYou kind of have to   a lot of what you thought about the shape of reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you\u2019re wrong it\u2019s that you fundamentally misread what happened. \u201d What is so disorienting for many conservatives is that the Trump victory was the culmination of the unruly populist upwelling in American politics, first manifested in the Tea Party movement, that traditional Republicans thought they could eventually absorb. Instead, those forces have overtaken them one by one  \u2014   first claiming their House majority leader, Eric Cantor then their speaker, John A. Boehner and then an entire field of presidential candidates. Now it may claim their party. Some on Mr. Trump\u2019s team are already boasting how they plan to break with decades of conservative orthodoxy on government spending and pursue a huge infrastructure spending package that sounds more Roosevelt than Reagan. \u201cThe conservatives are going to go crazy,\u201d Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s senior counselor and chief strategist, gleefully told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published Friday. \u201cWith negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything  \u2014   shipyards, ironworks, get them all jacked up,\u201d said Mr. Bannon, who has aimed almost as much fire at what he regards as establishment Republicans as he has at Democrats. \u201cIt will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution. \u201d Some conservatives say they could surely live with a few of the proposals of Mr. Trump\u2019s they find worrisome, like a big spending bill, especially if they come with sweeteners like tax breaks or spending cuts in other areas. The easiest way to forge ahead, many are finding, is to disassociate the man from the policy. \u201cI will do everything I can to help him,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has refused on numerous other occasions to help Mr. Trump, including voting for him or attending the Republican National Convention. Mr. Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill this week that he believed he could work with Mr. Trump on issues like the military budget, which both men support expanding. Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group supported by David and Charles Koch that decided not to spend any money on the presidential race this year despite spending tens of millions to help Mitt Romney in 2012, is also cracking the door to Mr. Trump. The group, however, declined to say whether it had met or spoken to anyone inside Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged on several fronts by the possibility of the Republican Congress working with the new president,\u201d said Tim Phillips, Americans for Prosperity\u2019s president, citing the prospect of repealing some of President Obama\u2019s energy policies along with the Affordable Care Act. But as with any period of grief, acceptance comes in different ways. Some find catharsis in writing. Others console themselves in data that show they really were not all that wrong. Then there are those who still talk as if they are in mourning: They have good days and bad days. \u201cLife goes on,\u201d said Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor and leading \u201cNever Trump\u201d stalwart, who has written columns about his coming to terms with   Trump. Any given day, Mr. Kristol said in an interview, he feels a range of competing sentiments. \u201cI\u2019m sort of somewhere between \u2018trust but verify\u2019 and \u2018distrust but verify,\u2019 \u201d he said, using modified versions of Reagan\u2019s famous quote about how he approached negotiating with the Soviets. On the subject of Reagan  \u2014   it is hard not to talk to conservatives today about Mr. Trump and not have them wistfully invoke their    \u2014   Mr. Kristol said he feared people were drawing parallels to Mr. Trump that risk setting the wrong standards for success. \u201cThe Reagan revolution wasn\u2019t that he beat Jimmy Carter in 1980,\u201d he said. \u201cNot that I didn\u2019t love that. The Reagan Revolution was that he governed successfully for eight years and won the Cold War. \u201d Others are concerned that the conservative movement missed an opportunity to appeal to a younger and more diverse group of voters. And they wonder how it will do so with someone as divisive as Mr. Trump atop the Republican Party. Steve Deace, a conservative radio host in Iowa and prominent \u201cNever Trump\u201d figure, pointed to the tens of thousands of voters in Wisconsin and Michigan  \u2014   states Mr. Trump barely won  \u2014   who voted in other races but did not cast a vote for president, evidently because they could not bring themselves to vote for him. \u201cThat\u2019s not lightning in a bottle,\u201d he said, making the point that Mr. Trump repelled so many voters that he almost lost. \u201cThat\u2019s like you showed up for work and they said this is your last paycheck and you and your wife go to Las Vegas, put it all on black and it pays off. \u201d Mr. Sykes, the radio personality in Wisconsin, said he at least felt liberated. By not supporting Trump he does not feel compelled to defend him like so many of his conservative friends do. Mr. Sykes has been writing a new book, which he tentatively titled \u201cHow the Right Lost Its Mind. \u201d But he is struggling to finish it. \u201cObviously I thought it was going to have a different ending,\u201d he said, asking aloud what he still struggles with. \u201cHow did this happen? Who are your friends? What do they actually believe?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563296.248929}
