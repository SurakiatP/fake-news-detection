Speaking in the hangar bay of the   Gerald R. Ford, which this year will become the nation\u2019s largest and most powerful warship, Mr. Trump said the Navy  \u2014   and other military services  \u2014   must grow and modernize. \u201cWe will make it easier for the Navy to plan for the future and thus to control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer,\u201d the president said. \u201cThe same boat for less money, the same ship for less money, the same airplanes for less money. \u201d Ever the showman, Mr. Trump arrived on the carrier in dramatic style, landing on the flight deck aboard his helicopter, Marine One. He emerged with a sharp salute and wearing his trademark red Make America Great Again baseball cap. One deck below, watching on large screens, hundreds of sailors and others let up a huge cheer for the commander in chief. After touring the ship, the president was lowered to the hangar bay on the massive elevator that carries fighter jets between the decks. To the sounds of Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the U. S. A. ,\u201d Mr. Trump strode into the crowd  \u2014   wearing a Gerald R. Ford baseball cap. Mr. Trump marveled at the ship\u2019s size, calling it \u201c4. 5 acres of combat power and sovereign U. S. territory, the likes of which there is nothing to compete. \u201d \u201cIt is a monument to American might that will provide the strength necessary to ensure peace,\u201d he said. The Ford is the first of a new, more technologically advanced class of aircraft carrier, and cost about $13 billion to build after cost overruns and years of delay. But Mr. Trump did not mention those challenges, saying instead that he supports expanding to a   Navy, from the current 10. He said ships like the Ford will allow him and future presidents to project American power in distant lands. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s power we don\u2019t have to use. But if we do, they are in big, big trouble,\u201d he said to cheers from the sailors. Mr. Trump asserted, as he did during the presidential campaign, that the Navy is now the smallest it has been since World War I. The Navy swelled from 245 ships in 1916 to a peak of over 6, 000 during World War II, downsizing between conflicts and bulking up during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. From the 1970s, the Navy gradually began to shrink to a total battle force of 275 ships as of September 2016. But that fleet includes 10 aircraft carriers, 22 cruisers, 63 destroyers, 11 amphibious assault ships and 68 submarines, 14 of which are armed with nuclear warheads. These are far more powerful than the fleets of World War II. So comparing the navies of the past and today is \u201clike comparing the telegraph to the smartphone they\u2019re just not comparable,\u201d Ray Mabus, the secretary of the Navy under President Barack Obama, said in 2012. Lawmakers in both parties have already expressed deep skepticism about Mr. Trump\u2019s military spending proposal, in part because of its potential to increase the nation\u2019s deficit and in part because of the administration\u2019s assertion that it would deeply slash nonmilitary spending to compensate. But the president\u2019s desire to expand the military was a core promise during his campaign for the White House. American politicians often seek to associate themselves with the country\u2019s enormous, gleaming war machines. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, announced his choice of Speaker Paul D. Ryan as his running mate on the retired battleship Wisconsin. But sometimes the moment goes awry. In 2003, President George W. Bush stood on the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to declare that the military phase of the Iraq war was over. He spoke in front of a banner that proclaimed \u201cMission Accomplished. \u201d The war continued for years. Aides to Mr. Trump are hoping that the images of the president on the Ford are more positive.'"}, "time": 1742563535.8353634}
