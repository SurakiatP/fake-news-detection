Afropunk the Takeover  \u2014   Harlem, running from Tuesday through Feb. 25, will celebrate black culture with music, art, film screenings, discussions and comedy.   by Harlem Stage and the Apollo Theater, this series is the latest offering from Afropunk, which hosts a music festival in Brooklyn. While music is an integral part of this Harlem festival, a couple of its more   events focus on activism  \u2014   from art in response to current events to the expression of black joy  \u2014   which is especially resonant in this moment of racial division and continued protests against the Trump administration. \u201cBearing Witness as Protest,\u201d at the Studio Museum in Harlem on Thursday, will examine political dissent in art. The evening begins with a guided tour of two exhibitions: \u201cThe Window and the Breaking of the Window,\u201d with art from the Black Lives Matter era, and \u201cCirca 1970,\u201d whose focus is on the sociopolitical and cultural issues of the \u201970s. The shows further affirm that, in the age of the   news cycle and endless social media feeds, there\u2019s no escape from news of horrific acts of hate, social injustices and inequalities. Works by Rudy Shepherd depict the nine parishioners killed in a Charleston, S. C. church in 2015, and others evoke the \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d rallying cry for protesters in the aftermath of a fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult show, and I think some people might be moved by some of the images,\u201d Amanda Hunt, associate curator at the museum, said last week. \u201cThey might be saddened and I wanted to give space for all of that. \u201d Deborah Grant\u2019s \u201c56 Blows,\u201d from her \u201cBlackboard\u201d series, initially looks simplistic  \u2014   the outline of a camcorder drawn in white chalk on a black background underneath is the title rendered in block letters. The title is a haunting nod to the 56 blows inflicted on Rodney King by the Los Angeles police in 1991 the camcorder a reminder of the documentation of the violence. In \u201cA Beautiful Ghetto,\u201d Devin Allen\u2019s    photographs chronicle the response of black residents in Baltimore to such violence  \u2014   like Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody. Tying it all together are Kerry James Marshall\u2019s prints echoing slogans that blacks have used to organize, resist and uplift (\u201cby any means necessary,\u201d \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d)  \u2014   reminders that the black experience is as much about having pride as exposing social inequities. The tour, starting at 6 p. m. will be followed by a discussion focusing on what it means to bear witness  \u2014   to share traumatic experiences  \u2014   and how the act itself might be a form of protest. The artist Oasa DuVerney and Jess Krug of Harlem CopWatch, a coalition documenting the police\u2019s interactions with the public, will participate. While the Studio Museum will tackle activism through a creative lens, a discussion on Tuesday at the National Black Theater will ask panelists to look inward to ponder the emotional expressions of resistance. The aim of \u201cBlack Joy as an Expression of Resistance and Liberation\u201d is to shine a light on the importance of cultivating and seeking out diverse narratives of black lives and opposing stereotypical depictions that pop up across the media. The panelists  \u2014   including the actress Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Larry   of ARTNOIR and the Afropunk founder, Matthew Morgan  \u2014   will also discuss the importance of caring for oneself as well as those in your circle of friends and family. \u201cBlack joy is really that pursuit of healing all of those wounds,\u201d Sade Lythcott, chief executive of the National Black Theater and a panelist, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhen the pendulum swings so far to one side where there is this epidemic of trauma being displayed as entertainment,\u201d she said of videos depicting interactions between the police and black people, \u201cartists are always going to rise up\u201d as a means of both documentation and catharsis. Andr\u00e9 D. Singleton, a   of the Very Black Project, which celebrates black culture through apparel among other things, and moderator of the \u201cBlack Joy\u201d event, said in a phone interview that delving into \u201cthe places we don\u2019t want to go, the stewing, actually allowing ourselves to feel,\u201d is imperative to moving forward. \u201cI grew up in the church, and I was taught that happiness is fleeting and joy is something the world can\u2019t take away,\u201d he said, reflecting on the Maze and Frankie Beverly song \u201cJoy and Pain,\u201d which perhaps describes the balance between the two. Here are a few events to check out:  FEB. 24 AT 6:30 P. M. A screening of \u201cThe Talk  \u2014   Race in America\u201d at the Cinema at the Maysles Documentary Center. FEB. 24 AT 7:30 P. M. \u201cThe Hair Tales,\u201d a discussion about black hair culture, at Harlem Stage. FEB. 25 AT 7:30 P. M. Afropunk: \u201cUnapologetically Black,\u201d a homage to black protest music featuring Robert Glasper and others, at the Apollo Theater.'"}, "time": 1742562052.338763}
