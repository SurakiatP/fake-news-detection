On Tuesday night a heckler interrupted her speech, waving a sign that read \u201cBill Clinton is a rapist.\u201d Her response, instead of showing her usual controlled aplomb and restraint, surprised the crowd at its intensity and ferocity. Pointing at the offender and shouting at the top of her voice, Clinton exploded: I\u2019m sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump! \\nThe protestor was immediately led away and his sign was torn apart. It turned out that the protestor was vying for a cash prize being offered by Alex Jones of InfoWars.com to anyone appearing either on television or at a Clinton rally chanting \u201cBill Clinton is a rapist\u201d and wearing a t-shirt bearing the same slogan. \\nNBC News tried to downplay the interruption, noting that while other protestors have shown up at rallies featuring President Obama and Bill Clinton himself, they are bringing attention to \u201cdecades-old allegations from three women who accuse Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. The former president has denied all of the allegations.\u201d \\nThe video of Hillary\u2019s outburst is here: \\nThere\u2019s an old saying, \u201cA measure of a person is the size of the thing that gets her goat.\u201d Hillary\u2019s goat, in the form of a protestor interrupting her speech, was sufficient to expose how close to the edge Hillary lives when things don\u2019t go her way. \\nTNA contributor Selwyn Duke has posted numerous verbal tirades from Clinton on his website, none of which are acceptable to be printed here. They do, however, reflect the mental instability of an individual behaving like a child when her candy is taken away. Her foul mouth shows the degree of corruption from which she suffers, as explained in James 3:5,6: Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one\u2019s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. \\nJesus Himself said it best of all: What goes into someone\\'s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them. \\nClinton has spent nearly her entire adult life seeking power. Now that the ultimate prize \u2014 once so close she could taste it \u2014 is escaping her, the real Hillary is being exposed. \\nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.
