[\u201cFacebook\u2019s contribution is worth more than $120, 000, according to our sources,\u201d the Daily Beast reported on Tuesday. \u201cHalf of that is cash, and the other half is   support for CPAC\u2019s operations. Facebook will have a space at the conference for attendees to film Facebook Live videos, and will also train people on best practices for using the social network and Instagram. \u201d  Chairman of the American Conservative Union Matt Schlapp, who hosts CPAC, praised Facebook\u2019s involvement with the conference. \u201cWe are glad Facebook agreed to be at CPAC and to acknowledge the importance of conservatives to their company, and we continue to work with them on issues important to conservatives,\u201d he declared. Facebook, meanwhile, defended their contribution, citing their involvement in a wide range of events \u201cacross the political spectrum. \u201d \u201cFacebook participates in events hosted by organizations across the political spectrum. Our presence allows us to facilitate an open dialogue where people can share their views and create content to engage their audiences, just as we did during other political events such as the Republican and Democratic Party conventions,\u201d explained a Facebook spokesman. \u201cOur involvement is not an endorsement of any particular position or platform. \u201d During CPAC, Facebook will hold numerous workshops, while an event on how attendees can \u201cbetter reach and connect with voters on Facebook\u201d will also be held at the conference on Wednesday.
