[The    actress  \u2014   set to play Paul Revere\u2019s daughter in the upcoming Fox series Making History  \u2014   made the claim in an interview with Yahoo! Style to promote the show.  \u201cLike, if I could snap my fingers? Trump would not be elected. That\u2019s all,\u201d Meester told the outlet. The actress noted that she may have opted to change an altogether different historic event had Trump not won the presidency in November. \u201cAs of right now, I feel that way,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore Trump, I would have said that Hitler was never born. Humans are so f*cked up. \u201d Meester wasn\u2019t particularly politically outspoken during the 2016 presidential campaign. But in a recent interview with beauty outlet Byrdie, the actress described the atmosphere in   America as \u201ccrazy\u201d and said she found it \u201cchallenging\u201d to constantly tune in to the news. The actress added that issues of sexism and climate change continue to plague the country. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we should take these issues for granted. But I think what can\u2019t be as easily defended is the environment, and people are doing irreparable damage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unbelievable that there are people out there who don\u2019t think so. They just ignore the facts, and that\u2019s pretty scary. Four years: Maybe we don\u2019t have that long. \u201d The actress  \u2014   who played socialite Blair Waldorf in the popular Gossip Girl television series  \u2014   is hardly the only star to compare Trump to Nazi leader Hitler. Numerous celebrities, including John Legend, Bill Maher, Louis C. K. Eva Longoria and Cher, to name just a few, have all made the comparison. So have news outlets like the Washington Post. Adolf Hitler oversaw the slaughter of six million Jews, as well as the murders of millions of others, including Polish, Serbian, and Russian political prisoners the mentally and physically handicapped (who often underwent forced sterilization) gypsies, and gay people in concentration camps across Europe during World War II. The Nazi Holocaust of Europe\u2019s Jews  \u2014   who were singled out for destruction  \u2014   is considered the most infamous genocide in modern history. Hitler\u2019s victims were gassed to death, forced on   \u201cdeath marches,\u201d lined up to be shot in firing lines, and had their remains burned in crematoriums. Others starved to death or died from illnesses and diseases spread throughout the camps. Trump was elected president on November 8, 2016, and it was not immediately clear which of his policies could be reasonably compared to the death and destruction wrought by Hitler.
