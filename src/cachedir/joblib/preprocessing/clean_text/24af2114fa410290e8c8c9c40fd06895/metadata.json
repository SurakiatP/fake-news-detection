Fanning on Tuesday as secretary of the Army, making him the   openly gay official ever at the Pentagon. The voice vote ended a confirmation process that had been delayed for months by a Republican senator who wanted assurances that detainees from Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, would not be sent to his state. But as the senator, Pat Roberts of Kansas, explained how his concerns had been resolved, one of his statements indicated that the administration does not believe it will be able to close the prison before President Obama leaves office. Mr. Roberts said on the Senate floor that he had been assured last week by the deputy defense secretary, Robert O. Work, that Mr. Obama would not move Guant\u00e1namo detainees to Fort Leavenworth, Kan. because \u201cthe clock has run out. \u201d In a statement, Mr. Work said he had made clear to Mr. Roberts that \u201cwe have not taken any location off the table for relocating Guant\u00e1namo detainees. \u201d Still, Mr. Work acknowledged that there was \u201climited time left\u201d to gain Congress\u2019s support for the administration\u2019s plan to close the prison. There have been signs that time is short. The administration said in February that every potential site the government had studied for housing Guant\u00e1namo detainees would need substantial construction work. No contracts have been put out in the three months since then, because Congress has banned bringing detainees into the United States or spending any money to modify a prison to accommodate them. Mr. Fanning, 47, has held   posts across the armed services, including as Air Force under secretary and deputy under secretary of the Navy. He has also served as chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter.'"}, "time": 1742563273.1282105}
