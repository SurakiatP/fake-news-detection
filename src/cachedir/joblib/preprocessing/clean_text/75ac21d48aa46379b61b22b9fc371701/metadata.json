At a hastily organized White House event  \u2014   ostensibly to announce a new nominee for labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta  \u2014   Mr. Trump engaged in an extended attack on the news media and insisted that his new administration was not a chaotic operation but a \u201c  machine. \u201d Any challenges, he said, were not his fault. \u201cTo be honest, I inherited a mess,\u201d he said. In addition to his cabinet announcement, the president revealed that he had asked the Justice Department to investigate government leaks and said he would sign an executive order next week restricting travel to the United States. He promised to produce by March a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, followed by another plan to overhaul the tax system. But his   news conference was dominated by an extraordinarily raw and angry defense of both his administration and his character. At times abrupt, often rambling, characteristically boastful yet seemingly pained at the portrayals of him, Mr. Trump kept summoning the spirit of his successful campaign after a month of grinding governance to remind his audience, again, that he won. For a president who has already lost a court battle, fired an acting attorney general and a national security adviser, and lost a cabinet nomination fight, Mr. Trump was eager to demonstrate that he was still in command. He attacked judges for blocking his original travel order and Democrats for obstructing his nominations. He denied being   even when no one accused him of it. With the latest Pew Research Center poll showing that just 39 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing, Mr. Trump at one point plaintively pleaded for understanding. \u201cThe tone is such hatred,\u201d he said, referring to the commentary about him on cable television. \u201cI\u2019m really not a bad person. \u201d Mr. Trump disputed any contention that the White House was out of control or not fully functional, and boasted of a flurry of actions intended to create jobs, curb regulations and crack down on illegal immigration. \u201cThere has never been a presidency that has done so much in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. \u201d The enactment of a temporary ban on refugees and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, he maintained, was \u201cperfect,\u201d despite widespread confusion and subsequent court rulings blocking it. \u201cWe had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we had a bad court. \u201d Mr. Trump offered his first account of his decision to fire Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and others in the White House about the contents of a conversation with Russia\u2019s ambassador in December. He said he was not bothered that Mr. Flynn had talked with the ambassador about American sanctions on Russia before arriving at the White House. \u201cI didn\u2019t direct him,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I would have directed him, because that\u2019s his job. \u201d The problem, he said, was that Mr. Flynn had told Mr. Pence that sanctions did not come up during the conversation, an assertion belied by a transcript of the call, which had been monitored by American intelligence agencies. \u201cThe thing is he didn\u2019t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn\u2019t remember,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo either way, it wasn\u2019t very satisfactory to me. \u201d But he said reports that his campaign aides and other associates had contacts with Russia were \u201ca joke\u201d and \u201cfake news put out by the media. \u201d The New York Times reported this week that phone records and intercepted calls showed repeated contacts between some of his associates and Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. \u201cRussia is a ruse,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does. \u201d However, Mr. Trump said, all the pressure on Russia may ruin any future negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cPutin probably assumes that he can\u2019t make a deal with me anymore because politically, it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal,\u201d he said. Like presidents before him, Mr. Trump was peeved at a series of leaks, including about Mr. Flynn\u2019s call and his own conversations with foreign leaders. In addition to requesting the Justice Department investigation, he confirmed that he might assign a New York billionaire, Stephen A. Feinberg, to conduct a broad review of the intelligence agencies. \u201cHe\u2019s offered his services, and you know, it\u2019s something we may take advantage of,\u201d Mr. Trump said. But he added that it might not be necessary because \u201cwe are going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own. \u201d Mr. Trump returned again and again to his contest with Hillary Clinton, replaying key events from the 2016 campaign and reviving his favorite attacks. He repeated a claim that Mrs. Clinton gave Russia access to American nuclear fuel supplies. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing for Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. \u201d The State Department did sign off on the purchase of a Canadian company by a Russian state firm that gave Russia control of   of America\u2019s uranium production capacity, as did eight other agencies. But Mrs. Clinton was not in a position to approve or reject the deal when she was secretary of state, and it is not known if she was briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump spent much of the conference berating reporters and their news organizations. Clearly exasperated by coverage of him, he said he did not watch CNN but then gave a detailed critique of one of its shows. He cited specific articles in The Times and The Wall Street Journal that he called \u201cfake,\u201d even harking back to one from last year\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe press is out of control,\u201d he said. \u201cThe level of dishonesty is out of control. \u201d He added later, \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t believe you people anymore. \u201d The acrimony grew so sharp at one point that CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta felt the need to tell Mr. Trump, \u201cJust for the record, we don\u2019t hate you. \u201d But that did not assuage him. At one point, he called on Jake Turx, an   Jewish reporter from Ami Magazine. \u201cAre you a friendly reporter?\u201d he asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or anyone on your staff of being \u201d Mr. Turx said. But, citing bomb threats against Jewish centers, he said, \u201cWhat we haven\u2019t really heard being addressed is an uptick in   and how the government is planning to take care of it. \u201d Mr. Trump bristled, taking it as a suggestion that he was   even though the reporter specifically said the opposite. \u201cI am the least   person that you\u2019ve ever seen in your entire life,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Turx protested that he was not suggesting otherwise. \u201cQuiet, quiet, quiet,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSee? He lied. He was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question. \u201d Instead, Mr. Trump said, the question was \u201crepulsive\u201d and \u201cvery insulting. \u201d He later accused Democrats of posing as supporters and holding up offensive signs at his rallies to smear him. When April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks asked whether he would meet with the Congressional Black Caucus to discuss his urban agenda, Mr. Trump again seemed piqued. \u201cDo you want to set up the meeting?\u201d he challenged her. \u201cAre they friends of yours?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just a reporter,\u201d said Ms. Ryan, who is  . \u201cWell, then, set up the meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump said. That exchange and others included claims that were false or disputed. Mr. Trump told Ms. Ryan that he had planned a meeting with Representative Elijah E. Cummings, an   Democrat from Maryland, but that Mr. Cummings had said: \u201cIt might be bad for me politically. I can\u2019t have that meeting. \u201d Mr. Cummings later denied that. \u201cI have no idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today,\u201d he said. \u201cI was actually looking forward to meeting with the president about the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs. \u201d Similarly, Mr. Trump asserted that his Electoral College victory was the largest since Ronald Reagan\u2019s. But he won fewer Electoral College votes than three of the four presidents since Reagan: Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George Bush. When a reporter pointed that out, Mr. Trump brushed it off. \u201cI was given that information,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562681.9541194}
