More than two years of trying, apparently, followed by some   strokes of luck. That, at least, is what was required to get \u201cThe Kittens\u2019 Wedding,\u201d an elaborate tableau by the Victorian taxidermist Walter Potter, to the Morbid Anatomy Museum, where it is the eerily commanding centerpiece of the new exhibition \u201cTaxidermy: Art, Science  Immortality. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s such a perfect object, with a tension between the perverse and the adorable,\u201d Joanna Ebenstein, the museum\u2019s   and creative director, said in a telephone conversation a few days before the piece\u2019s installation. \u201cI think it will really shock people. \u201d Mr. Potter ( ) is considered a master of visionary taxidermy, familiar to generations of British vacationers who passed through his homespun museum in Sussex, England, where hundreds of pieces  \u2014   from single specimens to elaborate tableaus featuring kittens, frogs, birds and rats in all manner of humanlike situations  \u2014   were displayed cheek by jowl. \u201cThe Kittens\u2019 Wedding,\u201d completed in the 1890s, shows a wedding party gathered solemnly at an altar. (One   gentleman, it must be noted, bears a striking resemblance to Winston Churchill.) It is not the largest of Potter\u2019s tableaus, but it is the only one in which the animals are fully clothed, right down to frilly undergarments properly out of sight. The Morbid Anatomy show, running through Nov. 6, is the first formal exhibition of a Potter piece in the United States, Ms. Ebenstein said. But his work has had previous brushes with   respectability. In 2001, \u201cThe Kittens\u2019 Wedding\u201d was shown at the Victoria  Albert Museum in London, as part of the exhibition \u201cThe Victorian Vision. \u201d In 2003, when the entire Potter collection was put up for auction, the artist Damien Hirst offered a million pounds (about $1. 6 million at the time) to halt the sale and keep the collection intact, despite having his doubts about the   Mr. Potter\u2019s technical skills. \u201cYou can see he knew very little about anatomy and musculature,\u201d Mr. Hirst wrote in The Guardian after his offer was rebuffed. \u201cThe kittens don\u2019t look very much like kittens,\u201d he added, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the point. \u201d Getting Mr. Potter\u2019s work to Brooklyn has been something of a personal quest for Ms. Ebenstein, the   with Pat Morris, of the book \u201cWalter Potter\u2019s Curious World of Taxidermy. \u201d When the museum moved into its   building in Gowanus in 2014, Ms. Ebenstein wanted to open with an exhibition of his work, but borrowing the often unwieldy pieces from   collectors was too expensive. Then, this year, Ms. Ebenstein heard that \u201cThe Kittens\u2019 Wedding\u201d had been bought at auction for nearly $120, 000 by J. D. Powe, an educational software entrepreneur and collector who had previously lent pieces to the museum, in partnership with Antediluvian Antiques  Curiosities, a dealer in Lake Placid, N. Y. It was subsequently sold to Sabrina Hansen, the founder of a cat sanctuary in Catskill, N. Y. who agreed to the loan. \u201cSome people dismiss his work as Victorian whimsy, but it\u2019s really an extraordinary piece,\u201d Ms. Hansen, who also owns a Potter featuring a monkey riding a goat, said in an interview. \u201cThe way he twists their little heads around, it really tells a whole story. \u201d At Morbid Anatomy, which is dedicated to what Ms. Ebenstein likes to call objects that \u201cfall between the cracks\u201d of conventional categories, Potter\u2019s feline wedding is displayed along with more than 100 other pieces involving artfully preserved animals. \u201cWe have squirrels playing cards, some frogs being spanked, a drunk monkey,\u201d Ms. Ebenstein said, rattling off some anthropomorphic highlights. There\u2019s also an elaborate diorama, created in Paris around 1820, showing a crew of mice hard at work in a miniature paper factory. (A number of pieces are owned by Mr. Powe, curator of the exhibition.) There are specimens of extinct species like the passenger pigeon and the heath hen, and sections dedicated to oddities (  walrus, anyone?) and to bad taxidermy, as well as what Ms. Ebenstein called a \u201cwall of pets\u201d  \u2014   mostly dogs, lovingly presented in shadow boxes evoking eternal repose in the living room. Taxidermy was a common hobby in Potter\u2019s time, considered a suitable pastime even for genteel ladies. But Ms. Ebenstein said that she saw Mr. Potter less as a taxidermist than as \u201ca folk artist who used animals as his medium. \u201d That medium may cause discomfort in our era of vegan purses and   shelters. In the later years of Mr. Potter\u2019s museum, its proprietors felt compelled to post a sign claiming, perhaps wishfully, that no animals had been killed specifically to make Mr. Potter\u2019s tableaus. Ms. Ebenstein, who said that most of the instructors at Morbid Anatomy\u2019s popular taxidermy classes are animal rights activists and vegetarians, struck a note that was both    and philosophical. \u201cThis was the Victorian era, before cats were routinely spayed or neutered, and unwanted kittens were routinely drowned,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something happy, but it\u2019s true. \u201d \u201cIf an animal is going to die,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy not make something beautiful and memorable out of it?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628507.9784482}
