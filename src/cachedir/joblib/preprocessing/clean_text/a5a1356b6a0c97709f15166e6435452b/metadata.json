Farenthold\u2019s bill recognizes that \u201cexceptions\u201d to that prohibition were made \u201cfor active duty military personnel,\u201d but no exception was made for their spouses. This means spouses of a deployed military member could easily find themselves in a home unarmed \u2014  i. e. defenseless \u2014  for months at a time.  Farenthold\u2019s bill is titled, \u201cProtect Our Military Families\u2019 2nd Amendment Rights Act. \u201d In the press release which accompanied the Act\u2019s introduction Farenthold said, \u201cOur military spouses give up a great deal to support their active duty service member, often moving far from home and far from family to be with their spouse. Military spouses should not be denied their Second Amendment rights based on the orders of the military member. They have the right to defend themselves and their families just like anyone else. \u201d A text of the Act was sent to Breitbart News and its language amends current codes so that military spouses\u2019 residency is determined like the residency of active duty military personnel, as relates to the exercise of Second Amendment rights. The Act says: A member of the Armed Forces on active duty, or a spouse of such a member, is a resident of \u2014   \u2018\u2018(1) the State in which the member or spouse maintains legal residence  \u2018\u2018(2) the State in which the permanent duty station of the member is located and \u2018\u2018(3) the State in which the member maintains a place of abode from which the member commutes each day to the permanent duty station of the member. \u201d In the wake of recent, heinous attacks witnessed against our stateside military personnel at Chattanooga (July 16, 2015) and Fort Hood (November 5, 2009 and April 2, 2014) \u2014  as well as at other installations \u2014  taking steps that protect military families who are also near these installations is a necessity.
