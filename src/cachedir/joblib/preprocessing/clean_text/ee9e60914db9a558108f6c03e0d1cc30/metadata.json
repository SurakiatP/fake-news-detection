This time, the London-based Al-Hayat daily has claimed that the U.S. planned the attacks on the World Trade Center in order to create a global war on terror. \\nVia AlternativeNews \\n\\nThe article, written by Saudi legal expert Katib al-Shammari and translatedby MEMRI, claims that American threats to expose documents that prove Saudi involvement in the attacks are part of a long-standing U.S. policy that he calls \u201cvictory by means of archives.\u201d\\nScroll Down For Video Below! Al-Shammari claims that the U.S. chooses to keep some cards close to its chest in order to use them at a later date.\\nOne example is choosing not to invade Iraq in the 1990s and keeping its leader, Saddam Hussein, alive to use as \u201ca bargaining chip\u201d against other Gulf States. Only once Shi\u2019ism threatened to sweep the region did America act to get rid of Hussein \u201csince they no longer saw him as an ace up their sleeve.\u201d\\nHe claims that the 9/11 attacks were another such card, enabling the U.S. to blame whoever suited its needs at a particular time; first it blamed Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, then Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime in Iraq, and now Saudi Arabia.\\nSeptember 11 is one of winning cards in the American archives, because all the wise people in the world who are experts on American policy and who analyze the images and the videos [of 9/11] agree unanimously that what happened in the [Twin] Towers was a purely American action, planned and carried out within the U.S. Proof of this is the sequence of continuous explosions that dramatically ripped through both buildings. \u2026 Expert structural engineers demolished them with explosives, while the planes crashing [into them] only gave the green light for the detonation \u2013 they were not the reason for the collapse. But the U.S. still spreads blame in all directions.\\nThe intention of the attacks, writes al-Shammari in his conspiracy article, was to create \u201can obscure enemy \u2013 terrorism \u2013 which became what American presidents blamed for all their mistakes\u201d and that would provide justification for any \u201cdirty operation\u201d in other countries.\\nThe terror label was applied to Muslims even though it was Muslims who helped America defeat the Soviets and bring an end to the Cold War, he writes. The problem, asserts al-Shammari, is that the U.S. must always find a new impetus to have an adversary, for \u201cthe nature of the U.S. is that it cannot exist without an enemy.\u201d\\nAl-Shammari\u2019s article comes amid a torrent of vociferous articles in the Saudi press that range from accusing the U.S. of being \u201cschizophrenic\u201d and in cahoots with Iran to publishing warnings that if passed, the \u201cSatanic\u201d bill would \u201copen the gates of hell.\u201d\\n'"}, "time": 1742563333.477186}
