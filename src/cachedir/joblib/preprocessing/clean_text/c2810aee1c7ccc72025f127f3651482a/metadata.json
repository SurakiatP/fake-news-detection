Bernie Sanders on Thursday attributed the Republican win to the failure of the liberal elite to represent working people. \\n\u201cIt is an embarrassment, I think, to the entire of [the] Democratic Party that millions of white working-class people decided to vote for Mr. Trump, which suggests that the Democratic message of standing up for working people no longer holds much sway among workers in this country,\u201d the progressive senator and one-time presidential candidate told the Associated Press . \\n\u201cYou cannot be a party which on one hand says we\u2019re in favor of working people, we\u2019re in favor of the needs of young people but we don\u2019t quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople do not believe that. You\u2019ve got to decide which side you\u2019re on.\u201d \\nSanders\u2014who, according to hypothetical polls conducted during the primary, would have posed a more formidable challenge to Trump than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2014told the news outlet that he is \u201cnot ruling out\u201d another presidential bid in 2020. But, the 75-year-old senator from Vermont said that, for now, he is focused on rebuilding the party. \\nAmong the potential changes to be made, Sanders told AP that he would recommend Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to lead the Democratic National Committee (DNC), a position that Ellison has been reportedly vying for. \\nThe interview comes one day after Sanders issued a statement saying he is prepared to work with the president-elect \u201c[t]o the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country.\u201d \\nBut, the senator indicated on Thursday he did not think that would be likely. \u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong, but I believe that he is a fraud, and I think despite all of his rhetoric about being a champion of the working class, it will turn out to be hollow,\u201d Sanders said. \\nIn an appearance on CNN late Thursday afternoon, when asked if he could have beaten Trump , Sanders said, \u201cWhat good does it do now?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563087.9818318}
