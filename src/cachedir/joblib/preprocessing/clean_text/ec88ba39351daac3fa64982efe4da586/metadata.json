At a meeting with young people on the second day of his visit to Europe, during which he championed a new trade deal between the United States and the European Union, the president took questions on a variety of topics, including Northern Ireland, transgender rights and racial profiling. After responding to a questioner who suggested that his administration had not done enough to address racial profiling at airports  \u2014   a practice that Mr. Obama said he adamantly opposed  \u2014   the president turned his attention to the Black Lives Matter movement. He praised the movement as \u201creally effective in bringing attention to problems,\u201d but said young activists should be more willing to work with political leaders to craft solutions instead of criticizing from outside the political process. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve highlighted an issue and brought it to people\u2019s attention and shined a spotlight, and elected officials or people who are in a position to start bringing about change are ready to sit down with you, then you can\u2019t just keep on yelling at them,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room, and then to start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. \u201d Mr. Obama began his career as a community organizer working on local initiatives in poor neighborhoods in Chicago. Sometimes, he said, solving a problem means accepting a series of partial solutions. \u201cYou then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable, that can institutionalize the changes you seek, and to engage the other side, and occasionally to take half a loaf that will advance the gains that you seek, understanding that there\u2019s going to be more work to do, but this is what is achievable at this moment,\u201d he said. It was not the first time that he has cautioned Black Lives Matter activists that social change cannot happen overnight. In a private meeting at the White House in 2014, Mr. Obama told a group of young black activists that change was \u201chard and incremental,\u201d one participant said at the time. When some activists at that meeting said they felt that their voices were not being heard, Mr. Obama replied, \u201cYou are sitting in the Oval Office, talking to the president of the United States. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563960.308779}
