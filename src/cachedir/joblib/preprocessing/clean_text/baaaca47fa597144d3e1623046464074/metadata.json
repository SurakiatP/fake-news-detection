[Pruitt predicted: \u201cI really believe that at the end of eight years [of the Trump administration] we\u2019re going to have better air quality, we\u2019re going to have better water quality because we\u2019ve invested in a partnership,\u201d  The partnership between the states and the federal government, Pruitt said, is one \u201cthat exists legally, that exists constitutionally. \u201d Pruitt also focused on two of the themes that he addressed last month during his confirmation hearings: (1) The actions of the Environmental Protection Agency must be guided by the rule of law. (2) The goals of environmental quality and energy production are not incompatible. \u201cI think when we have a mutually exclusive kind of approach  \u2014   that if you\u2019re   you\u2019re   when you\u2019re   you\u2019re    \u2014   what that means is that we\u2019ve been used to serve political ends,\u201d Pruitt told Loudon. \u201cWe as a nation are better than that,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause we do both. We grow jobs we also take care of our air, our water we also take care of our children,\u201d the former Oklahoma Attorney General added. \u201cHow can the people here at CPAC help you take that message to their peers, their work environments, their schools as they go back out into the real world?\u201d Loudon asked. \u201cAnother key term is trust. There\u2019s distrust right now that exists between the states and Washington, D. C. as it relates to the environment,\u201d Pruitt responded. \u201cWe need to do what we can to restore trust. I\u2019m going to be spending time in West Virginia and Ohio with the state governors and the executive branches of government there,\u201d Pruitt promised. \u201cI\u2019m going to send a message. Let\u2019s join    to do what\u2019s important for the environment,\u201d he concluded.'"}, "time": 1742562922.7952352}
