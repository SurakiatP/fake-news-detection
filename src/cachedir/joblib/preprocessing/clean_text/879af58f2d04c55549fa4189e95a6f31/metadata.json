From a Bible prophecy perspective the implications and ramifications of such a move are off the charts. We warned from the very start that this move could easily trigger the Psalm 83 War. And right on cue, here comes the Palestinians protesting it already. Things are about to get very, very interesting\u2026to say the least. \\n\u201cIf people attack us by moving the embassy to Jerusalem, which is a violation of Security Council resolutions, it is a violation of Resolution 181 of the UN general assembly that was drafted by the U.S. \u2026 it means they are showing belligerency towards us. \u2026 If they do that nobody should blame us for unleashing all of the weapons that we have in the UN to defend ourselves and we have a lot of weapons in the UN,\u201d Riyad Mansour said . \\nMansour conceded that such a move could not be passed as a Security Council resolution because of the U.S. veto. Nevertheless, he warned Trump, \u201cMaybe I can\u2019t have resolutions in the Security Council but I can make their lives miserable everyday with precipitating a veto on my admission as a member state.\u201d \\nMansour warned that he would \u201creopen the whole Pandora\u2019s Box\u201d of verdicts in the International Criminal Court of Justice on the issue of Israel\u2019s security fence and the settlements. \\nHe added that \u201cit is illegal to defy Security Council resolutions that the U.S. is party to that the unilateral action by Israel annexing East Jerusalem is illegal and it is null and void. If the U.S. administration wants to defy international law they are doing something illegal.\u201d  '"}, "time": 1742628406.6773698}
