Turkish President Erdogan has claimed Turkey retains an interest in Mosul, whose loss to a League of Nations ruling in the 1920s they don\u2019t recognize, and Erdogan has also warned that Abadi and the Iraqi government are not \u201cat his level\u201d where they can speak to him as an equal on the matter. \\nThe US has been trying to keep the two nations at least civil for the sake of the Mosul invasion, but claims by Pentagon officials that the two had an agreement in principle to work together clearly never panned out, and tensions are still on the rise.
