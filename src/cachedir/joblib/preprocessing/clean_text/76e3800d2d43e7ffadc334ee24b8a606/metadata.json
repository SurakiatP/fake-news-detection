Officer Daniel Pantaleo was caught on cell phone footage, filmed choking the life out of Garner on a Staten Island street corner. After two years of public outrage \u2013 in the failure to prosecute Pantaleo and an internal conflict at the DOJ, reports have surfaced, indicating that Pantaleo will stand trial for civil rights violations. \\nOne would think that the video evidence of Garner\u2019s murder would be enough to convict Pantaleo on a minimum voluntary manslaughter. A Staten Island grand jury failed to indict him on a charge of murder, which was presented to them last year. Again, the grand jury system is a fraud when it comes to police killings, as the prosecutor has sole discretion to prosecute. The grand jury system is used to placate the public, and this case was no different. Aside from the local authorities failing to prosecute, the FBI and the Justice Department lawyers handling the case out of Brooklyn didn\u2019t believe there was sufficient evidence to bring a federal civil rights violation charge. In order to do so, they would have to prove that Pantaleo intended to violate Garner\u2019s civil rights. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen sooner than later,\u201d said an unnamed source within the investigation. \u201cWashington wants to indict him.\u201d This information came out after the entire team of federal prosecutors was replaced. \\nIt is difficult to avoid the appearance of a cover-up when all of the initial investigators found nothing wrong with the actions taken by Pantaleo, which resulted in Garner\u2019s death. The fact that he used an illegal chokehold \u2013 which had been outlawed \u2013 seemed to make little impact on their decision. All the while, Pantaleo has been riding a desk and collecting his substantial six figure salary from the NYPD. \\nUp until now, the only person to have been penalized for Garner\u2019s death is Sgt. Kizzy Adonis, who was the supervisor on scene. The only charge was internal, not criminal, for failure to properly supervise. Adonis said in regards to the incident \u201cthe perpetrator\u2019s condition did not seem serious and\u2026 he did not appear to get worse.\u201d The outright lies told by police, when covering up their crimes, is enough to make your blood boil. Nothing about Adonis\u2019 statement had any truth to it, as Garner pleaded for help and ultimately died on scene. Hard to believe anyone wouldn\u2019t define death as \u201cgetting worse.\u201d \\nAlthough a federal charge seems imminent, an indictment is only the beginning of a very long battle. The fact that Pantaleo was brought before a grand jury only to have them not indict, doesn\u2019t look good for prosecutors. Even if the presentation was one-sided and an obvious fix, the defense can use it to demonstrate internal conflict and therefore, argue that the case is in fact, politically driven. It doesn\u2019t help matters when the jury finds out that the original prosecutors did not feel a charge was warranted and had been removed from the case. Presenting the internal conflict will not sit well with a jury. \\nThe New York Daily News spoke with an anonymous former federal prosecutor who stated \u201cIf I\u2019m Pantaleo\u2019s defense lawyer, I want all the internal communications that the prosecutors were fighting about.\u201d Obtaining specific details of the internal conflicts would indeed sway a jury. On the flip-side, he stated, \u201cThe government will argue, though, that it is internal deliberations and that you can\u2019t cross-examine witnesses about what the prosecutors think about their case.\u201d Others contend that the former prosecutors would be barred from being involved in the indictment and not allowed to give any testimony for the defense or prosecution. With the burden of proof falling on the shoulders of the DOJ, despite the clear-cut murder that took place, they\u2019ll fight an uphill battle in court. \\nThe Police Benevolent Association has denied that Pantaleo ever used a chokehold, and believes the entire issue is a moot point. Despite their cherry picking their own beliefs, they can\u2019t cherry pick their own facts in this case, as the video speaks for itself. While Pantaleo needs to stand trial for the death of Eric Garner, attempting to prove his intent is going to be difficult. It is unfortunate that the need to define Pantaleo\u2019s intent is overshadowing the true tragedy of this case: the very death of justice.'"}, "time": 1742562183.7757246}
