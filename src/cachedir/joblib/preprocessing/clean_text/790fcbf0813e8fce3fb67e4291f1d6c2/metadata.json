Chants of \u201cBlack Power!\u201d could be heard sporadically as well. But in this video, it appears an entire gang of black youth are seeking out and targeting white people to assault.\\n\u201cHey! We\u2019re beating up every white person! Get every white person!\u201d the cameraman says. \\nWhen he witnesses someone being assaulted, he asks \u201cWho they beatin\u2019 up? Who they beaten\u2019 up?\u201d \\nAt one point, when they spot a \u201cwhite person,\u201d he screams \u201cHe white! Beat his shit! Beat!\u201d \\nThe thug pans around looking for white people to assault. You can hear the crowd reacting, trying to point out white people. Again, he cries: \u201cHey! They beating up every white person!\u201d Apparently he spots a homeless man. \u201cLook at the f***in\u2019 white bum! Look at the white bum!\u201d\\nThroughout the rest of the video, there\u2019s screams of white people as their racist hunt continues. \\nToward the end, shots ring out in the distance, startling the cameraman. \u201cWho the f*** is shooting? Stop shooting!\u201d Moments later, shots are fired much closer and the video ends.\u201d \\nThis is the direct result of the Black Lives Matter racist, anti-police agenda and Barack Obama\u2019s acceptance of their cause. \\nThis is Obama\u2019s \u201c post-racial America .\u201d Welcome to it, folks .'"}, "time": 1742628504.669408}
