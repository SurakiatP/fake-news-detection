Jerry Brown declared Friday that the drought in his state is officially over, with a formal declaration to an end of the drought state of emergency in most counties. [In a statement released by his office, Brown said:  Following unprecedented water conservation and plentiful winter rain and snow, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today ended the drought state of emergency in most of California, while maintaining water reporting requirements and prohibitions on wasteful practices, such as watering during or right after rainfall. \u201cThis drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,\u201d said Governor Brown. \u201cConservation must remain a way of life. \u201d Executive Order    lifts the drought emergency in all California counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies. Today\u2019s order also rescinds two emergency proclamations from January and April 2014 and four drought \u2014  related executive orders issued in 2014 and 2015. The governor\u2019s proclamation comes after one of the wettest and snowiest winters in the state\u2019s recorded history. Initially, after last winter\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o brought moderate rains to Northern California, the state was expected to suffer through a dry winter, thanks to the La Ni\u00f1a effect. But one \u201cPineapple Express\u201d storm after another blew in off the Pacific, bringing atmospheric rivers to drench Northern and Southern California alike and coat mountains in snow. Earlier this week, the Sacramento Bee reported that Californians are still conserving water, in spite of the heavy precipitation. State water authorities likely hope that the habits formed during the drought will be retained  \u2014   though some local agricultural water authorities are currently pumping water to farmers as fast as they can to keep dams from overflowing.
