The FBI\u2019s decision, announced just last Friday, was provoked by the federal agency stumbling across 650,000 emails on a laptop shared by Hillary aide Huma Abedin with her now-estranged husband, the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner. \\nAs many experts have noted, only something very serious in the new emails \u2014 even more serious than what we already know about Hillary\u2019s email thus far \u2014 could have prompted the FBI to re-open its investigation. (1) Doug Shoen \\nA big-name Democrat has abandoned Hillary\u2019s sinking ship. \\nHe is Doug Shoen \u2014 Fox News contributor; former Democrat pollster/consultant for over 30 years, who is widely recognized as a co-inventor of overnight polling, whose clients included including British PM Tony Blair, Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi, and three Israeli PMs; and a friend of the Clintons since 1994. \\nOn Sunday night, Oct. 30, two days after FBI Director James Comey announced the reopening of the criminal investigation in a letter to Congress, Schoen told Fox News\u2019 Harris Faulkner that he is \u201creassessing\u201d his support for Hillary, although that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a Trump supporter. \\nHere\u2019s a partial transcript of what Schoen said by Real Clear Politics : \\nDOUG SCHOEN: As you know, I have been a supporter of Secretary Clinton\u2026 But given that this investigation is going to go on for many months after the election \u2026 But if the Secretary of State wins, we will have a president under criminal investigation, with Huma Abedin under criminal investigation, with the Secretary of State, the president-elect, should she win under investigation. Harris, under these circumstances, I am actively reassessing my support. I\u2019m not a Trump \u2014 \\nHARRIS FAULKNER, FOX NEWS: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You are not going to vote for Hillary Clinton? \\nSCHOEN: Harris, I\u2019m deeply concerned that we\u2019ll have a constitutional crisis if she\u2019s elected. \\nFAULKNER: Wow! \\nSCHOEN: I want to learn more this week. See what we see. But as of today, I am not a supporter of the Secretary of State for the nation\u2019s highest office. \\nFAULKNER: How long have you known the clintons. \\nSCHOEN: I\u2019ve known the clintons since \u201994. \\nFAULKNER: Wow! But their friend here has said he\u2019s reconsidering. \\nSCHOEN: I have to, because of the impact on the governance of the country and our international situation. \\nFAULKNER: So the news in that is are there other people, I would imagine, like Doug Schoen. (2) Chris Matthews? \\nMuch is made of a video clip of Chris Matthews, infamous for his near-orgasmic exclamation during the 2008 Democratic National Convention that listening to Barack Obama sent a thrill up his leg . Matthews has been a relentless promoter of Hillary, fawning over her performance in the first presidential debate against Trump as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d\u201chome run\u201d, and declaring the race for the presidency as \u201cover\u201d. \\nOn October 27, 2016, Matthews seemed to be endorsing Trump on his MSNBC Hardball show: \\nAlas, that video clip is misleading. \\nA fuller version of what Matthews said shows that Matthews was simply quoting Trump. In actuality, far from endorsing Trump, Matthews scolded Trump for getting sidetracked on petty issues/feuds, and called Trump\u2019s practice of politics \u201cpathetic\u201d. See the fuller video here . (3) Polls \\nA more important indicator of the fallout from the FBI\u2019s reopening of its criminal investigation into Hillary are the polls. \\nThe latest USC Dornsife/ Los Angeles Times \u201cDaybreak\u201d poll shows that support for Hillary has plummeted after the third and last presidential debate. Trump is now more than 5 points ahead of Hillary, polling at 47.8% vs. Hillary\u2019s 42.4%. Click image \u2193 to enlarge \\nDespite the increased support for Trump, when asked who they think will win the presidential election, 54.2% think Hillary will win, vs. 41.3% who think Trump will win. \\nBroken down into demographic groups, however, the LA Times poll shows that Hillary still has a lead among these unregenerate groups : Among those with a college graduate or more education , Hillary still leads at 51.2% vs. Trump\u2019s 38.1%. Among low-income voters (those with less than $35,000 a year in income) who polls show are also the least informed, with the least exposure to Alternate Media, Hillary leads at 53.4% vs. Trump\u2019s 35.6%. Among blacks , Hillary leads at 86.7% vs. Trump\u2019s 4.6%; among Latinos , Hillary leads at 53.1% vs. Trump\u2019s 34.9%. In contrast, among whites, Trump leads at 58.1% vs. Hillary\u2019s 32.2%; among \u201cother\u201d racial-ethnic groups, Trump leads at 49.9% vs. Hillary\u2019s 40.7%. Among females , Hillary still leads at 49.4% vs. Trump\u2019s 40.7%. In contrast, among men, Trump leads at 55.1% vs. Hillary\u2019s 36.3%.'"}, "time": 1742628480.8275287}
