Catholic Church announces a major warning against Hillary \\nA San Diego Catholic Church claims Hillary is doing the devils work. Reuters reported: A Roman Catholic church in San Diego told its parishioners the devil works through politicians like Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and warned that voting for Democrats is a \u201cmortal sin,\u201d according to local media and the church\u2019s website. The Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Old Town made the statements in its weekly leaflet to churchgoers, a copy of which remains on the church\u2019s website. The letter railed against issues like abortion and constraints on tax-exempt organizations from certain political activity, likening them to slavery. \u201cSatan has deceived many Christians to convert to worldly values from Christian ones,\u201d the Oct. 30 bulletin reads. \u201cThe devil does this through the tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton has stated, \u2018And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,\u2019 to draw us away from God\u2019s teachings.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742562060.248691}
