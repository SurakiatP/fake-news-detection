Both vicars\u2019 daughters and born just a few years apart, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain share an understated pragmatism and conservative roots, and have made their way in the still largely man\u2019s world of politics. But there could be so much more. At a time when President Trump is lashing out at friend and foe, and when the macho politics of strongmen is resurgent from Moscow to Manila, when not just the European Union but   Western values, free trade and security alliances are under attack, the two women might have worked together to defend the liberal global order. Instead, because of Britain\u2019s vote in June to leave the European Union, they find themselves on opposite sides of the biggest divorce in recent European history, a chasm that has fundamentally reordered their priorities and is hindering them from cooperating on the broader issues. At a meeting of European leaders in Malta last week, Mrs. May and Ms. Merkel abruptly canceled a planned bilateral meeting after a brief exchange during a sightseeing excursion was deemed enough. After lunch, when it came to discussing the threats facing Europe, Mrs. May was shown the door. Their differing priorities were on ample display this past week as they dealt with both Mr. Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Ms. Merkel, whose overriding strategic ambition as Germany\u2019s leader is to save the European Union, has kept her distance from Mr. Trump. After his election, she firmly outlined the liberal values on which she was prepared to work with him, and she swiftly condemned his travel ban aimed at seven   countries. Mrs. May, whose priority is to sign bilateral trade deals to offset her country\u2019s departure from Europe\u2019s single market, rushed to be the first foreign leader received by Mr. Trump after he took office. Apparently pleased to be caught on camera holding his hand, she extended a speedy invitation for a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II. \u201cOpposites attract,\u201d she beamed. The invitation has since become a polarizing issue in Britain\u2019s sharply divided political landscape, and reinforced a view on the Continent that as Britain cuts ties with Europe, it will become America\u2019s lap dog. \u201cIt\u2019s chalk and cheese,\u201d said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European history at Oxford. \u201cBut none of this tells you very much about the contrasting character of the two women. It tells you about the contrasting positions of the two countries. \u201d If Ms. Merkel can still afford to be an idealist, Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d has turned Mrs. May into a calculating realist. Within hours of leaving Mr. Trump, she was on a plane to Turkey. Upon arriving, Mrs. May waffled in her judgment of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, later stiffening her criticism after a public outcry. She also negotiated a deal with Turkey involving the British defense company BAE Systems. Five days later, Ms. Merkel paid her own visit to Mr. Erdogan and looked far clearer in her resolve when faced with the autocratic Turkish leader, calmly noting that she had raised controversial issues like press freedom and Turkey\u2019s future Constitution. Privately, German officials express some sympathy for Mrs. May\u2019s sometimes clumsy diplomacy, understanding that she needs new partners if she is to make good on her promise of a \u201cGlobal Britain. \u201d But only occasionally have there been glimpses of the partnership that might have been. In July, Ms. Merkel was almost effusive in welcoming Mrs. May, who chose Berlin for her first foreign trip as prime minister. The German chancellor emphasized their countries\u2019 \u201ccommon values. \u201d During a news conference, both women stiffly answered questions about Brexit. Then a journalist asked about their first impressions of each other. Their body language visibly loosened. Ms. Merkel laughed, and Mrs. May said, \u201cWe have two women here who, if I may say so, want to get on with the job. \u201d Their shared gender has led to many lazy comparisons, said Rosa Prince, the author of a biography of Mrs. May that is to be published this month. \u201cWhen you are a female political leader of a certain age, you are inevitably compared to Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel,\u201d she said. \u201cTheresa May is nothing like Margaret Thatcher, but as it happens has quite a lot in common with Angela Merkel. \u201d Each cautious and deliberate, they are both childless, have quiet husbands and enjoy watching sports. (Ms. Merkel knows soccer Mrs. May prefers cricket.) An Oxford graduate and lawmaker since 1997, Mrs. May was Britain\u2019s   home secretary of modern times before taking over from Prime Minister David Cameron in the confusion that followed the Brexit referendum. As Ms. Prince put it, \u201cShe was the last woman standing after all the men got burned or ran away. \u201d Ms. Merkel, a scientist before she went into politics, is long used to being the only woman in the room. Evelyn Roll, a German biographer of Ms. Merkel, said that, on the advice of a German actress, the chancellor had deliberately lowered the pitch of her voice to deter men from talking over her. Both women endured condescension and outright misogyny as they rose. Mrs. May has been called a \u201cbloody difficult woman\u201d by a fellow minister. Ms. Merkel\u2019s predecessor and mentor, Helmut Kohl, patronized her as \u201cmy girl. \u201d Even after Ms. Merkel unseated Mr. Kohl as leader of the Christian Democrats amid a party financing scandal, Germany\u2019s   news media belittled her as efficient but bland  \u2014   until she took office in 2005 and gradually became \u201cMutti,\u201d the mother of the nation. \u201cThe only way men can process that a woman is in power is apparently to liken her to their mother,\u201d Ms. Roll said. Ms. Merkel, who grew up in Germany\u2019s former Communist east, has never branded herself a feminist. But on her watch Germany has introduced boardroom quotas for women and created a generous system of paid parental leave shared between mothers and fathers. Mrs. May once wore a   that read, \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like. \u201d In 2005, Mrs. May   a group called Women2Win to elect more women to Parliament and then nurture them, something that Mrs. Thatcher was often criticized for not doing. \u201cThey are both serious people who don\u2019t grandstand, who don\u2019t play for the gallery,\u201d said Charles Grant, the director of the   Center for European Reform. But the few times the two women have met privately have been highly scripted affairs with little warmth on display, according to one person who was present at more than one of their meetings. \u201cTheresa May is not good at small talk,\u201d said Ms. Prince, the biographer. \u201cShe is not an easygoing, smooth person. She is not a natural diplomat. \u201d Ms. Merkel, however, is said to respect Mrs. May, considering her the \u201c \u201d in the British government, officials close to the chancellor say. For her part, Mrs. May has long expressed admiration for the German chancellor. \u201cThere are still people who don\u2019t rate her, are a bit dismissive, perhaps because of the way she looks and dresses,\u201d Mrs. May said in a 2012 interview with The Daily Telegraph. \u201cWhat matters is, what has she actually done? And when you look at her abilities in terms of negotiation and steering Germany through a difficult time, then hats off to her. \u201d The two will soon be on the opposite side of the negotiations as Brexit talks commence. There is no wish in Berlin to \u201cpunish\u201d Britain for leaving, said Peter Torry, Britain\u2019s ambassador in Germany until 2007, who still lives in the German capital. But Berlin\u2019s tone has grown more distant as Britain\u2019s resolve to leave has hardened and their interests diverge. Mrs. May has said she will turn Britain into a   competitor if no favorable deal is offered by the European Union by the end of a   negotiation. But given her promises for a fairer society, that proposal is not considered credible or workable by many business and political leaders in Europe. Nor is her offer to be a bridge to the new American president. At a news conference in Malta after the European Union summit meeting on Friday, Ms. Merkel was asked whether Germany should lower its corporation tax in line with the reductions signaled by Mrs. May and Mr. Trump. \u201cWe have a tax system in Germany that is weathering challenges well,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, suggesting that   societies rely on raising a fair amount of tax. One reason for the difference between the two women\u2019s approaches may be that one is just starting out as head of government, while the other has been in office for over a decade. \u201cMay is like Merkel 10 years ago,\u201d Ms. Roll said. Though sometimes accused of lacking a vision for Europe, Ms. Merkel is calm and strategic, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 research institute in Berlin. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously helpful in a situation where we risk seeing a lot of provocations coming out of Washington over the next few years,\u201d she said. By contrast, Ms. Schwarzer added, Mrs. May seems \u201cmore tactical at this point. \u201d One leader is consumed by preparing Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and the other with keeping the bloc together. Could they develop a pragmatic relationship during the Brexit talks and beyond? \u201cIt won\u2019t be a smooth ride,\u201d Ms. Prince said, \u201cbut it certainly has a better chance of succeeding with these two levelheaded women at the top. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562331.4622622}
