Trump. \u201cHillary Clinton is tough,\u201d Mrs. Obama, the first lady, told a crowd of several thousand in Charlotte, N. C. on Tuesday. \u201cSee,\u201d she continued, \u201cI\u2019ve watched her when she gets knocked down  \u2014   she doesn\u2019t complain. She doesn\u2019t cry foul. \u201d Tap, tap, tap, tap. It took a second for the audience to catch on: Mrs. Obama was mocking Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint that a faulty microphone had hindered his performance in his first presidential debate with Mrs. Clinton. But as Mrs. Obama continued  \u2014   \u201cNo, she gets right back up, comes back stronger\u201d  \u2014   the mostly young and heavily   crowd let out a deafening howl. They called her \u201cthe closer\u201d during Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, like a   relief pitcher used sparingly but with devastating effect. Mrs. Obama preferred spending time with her daughters over attending political rallies. But when she was unleashed before a pivotal caucus or primary, her story of growing up on the South Side of Chicago and falling in love with a young community organizer had an unmatched, almost magical power to turn out voters, campaign officials discovered. Eight years later, Mrs. Obama is playing a similar role for the woman whom she helped her husband defeat in that race. To divine the places where the Clinton campaign\u2019s turnout operation is under the greatest pressure, and the constituencies about which it is most concerned, look no further than where Clinton aides dispatch the popular first lady. She has appeared in North Carolina, at college campuses in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.  \u2014   all areas where Mrs. Clinton needs to drive up turnout among blacks and younger voters. \u201cShe chooses her moments, and she has made clear to her staff and the Democratic Party that she wants to go places where she can make a difference,\u201d said Peter Slevin, the author of \u201cMichelle Obama: A Life. \u201d \u201cIf a candidate is up by 15 or down by 15, you\u2019re not going to see Michelle Obama there. \u201d Mrs. Obama has made only about a   campaign appearances for Mrs. Clinton in the general election, each carefully approved by the White House. Each has become something of an event  \u2014   and her warm, spunky delivery has given rise to several of the kind of   moments that rarely emerge from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s rallies. President Obama, of course, has proved an immensely valuable surrogate for Mrs. Clinton, appealing frequently to the young, black and Latino voters who turned out in record numbers for him but who have proved lukewarm to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. He has gone so far as to tell black voters he would consider it a \u201cpersonal insult\u201d if they did not help elect Mrs. Clinton. But the first lady\u2019s reluctance to campaign means that the events she does attend speak volumes about the places Mrs. Clinton views as most critical in November. She is virtually tied with Mr. Trump in North Carolina, with its younger and diverse population. Enter Mrs. Obama. In Raleigh and Charlotte this week, where thousands of mostly younger voters turned out to hear her, Mrs. Obama came armed with data points about turnout from Mr. Obama\u2019s narrow victory in North Carolina in 2008. (He lost the state in 2012.) \u201cBarack won North Carolina by about 14, 000 votes,\u201d she said in Charlotte on Tuesday. \u201cThat sounds like a lot, but when you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state was a little over two voters per precinct. \u201d Mrs. Obama paused and gave a stern look to her largely young crowd. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d she continued. \u201cIf just two or three folks per precinct had gone the other way, or stayed home, Barack would have lost this state. \u201d Straight talk is a specialty. At La Salle University in Philadelphia last month, Mrs. Obama soberly warned college students not to support a   candidate. \u201cIf you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don\u2019t vote at all,\u201d she said, \u201cthen you are helping to elect Hillary\u2019s opponent. \u201d Mrs. Obama has also gone further than her husband in laying bare the emotional toll of the   birther movement, including Mr. Trump\u2019s   campaign to sow doubts about whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States. \u201cBack then, people had all kinds of questions about what kind of a president Barack would be,\u201d Mrs. Obama said in Fairfax in September on the same day Mr. Trump tried to distance himself from the birther claim. \u201cThings like: Does he understand us? Will he protect us? And then, of course, there were those who questioned  \u2014   and continue to question, for the past eight years, up through this very day  \u2014   whether my husband was even born in this country. \u201d Mrs. Obama\u2019s hard feelings from the 2008 campaign for a time extended to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, after an acrimonious South Carolina primary battle in which Mr. Clinton dismissed Mr. Obama\u2019s antiwar image as a \u201cfairy tale. \u201d But Mrs. Obama has long since come around, and often refers to Mrs. Clinton now as \u201cmy friend Hillary. \u201d She brings undeniable advantages to Mrs. Clinton 64 percent of Americans view Mrs. Obama favorably, according to a Gallup poll in August. But Gallup polling this week found 54 percent of the public holds an unfavorable opinion of Mrs. Clinton. Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director, called Mrs. Obama \u201cone of the most popular public figures in America\u201d and \u201ca highly effective messenger both at our convention and throughout the campaign. \u201d Mrs. Obama appears in an ad for Mrs. Clinton, called \u201cWatch,\u201d being shown in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. \u201cOur children watch everything we do,\u201d the first lady says, as images of Mrs. Clinton working with children flash on screen. \u201cThe person we elect as president has the power to shape their lives for years to come. \u201d Before making the case for Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Obama often describes her mixed emotions about leaving the White House. \u201cWe are experiencing a great transition for me and Barack and Malia and Sasha and Bo and Sunny and Grandma,\u201d she said in Charlotte on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m going to need a job, but it will be a job out of politics,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband\u2019s got to get a job  \u2014   somebody has got to hire that man. \u201d There were shouts of \u201cMichelle for president!\u201d and \u201cMichelle for mayor!\u201d  \u2014   but the first lady was having none of it. \u201cCan you believe I\u2019m campaigning again?\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy to be out here. Because this is the last time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562288.8238752}
