It was the day W. H. Auden died, a fact that seemed to portend the lush bohemian life that followed. Mr. Schjeldahl, a poet and art critic, would go on to write for The Village Voice and for The New Yorker, where he has remained for two decades Ms. Alderson was an actress and comic. They had a daughter, Ada Calhoun, who grew up to be a writer herself. She dedicated her recent book, \u201cSt. Marks Is Dead,\u201d a history of the street where she grew up, to them: \u201cTo my parents, who looked at the apocalyptic 1970s East Village and thought, What a great place to raise a kid. \u201d That chaos found counterbalance in a rural idyll. In the 1980s, Mr. Schjeldahl and his wife purchased many acres of mountainous land in the town of Bovina, a little more than three hours north of Midtown Manhattan. For more than a   the property served as the site of a Fourth of July celebration that has maintained a singular place in New York\u2019s social history, drawing friends, and friends of friends, from the city  \u2014   artists, writers, musicians, academics, gallery owners, movie stars  \u2014   and a considerable segment of the surrounding population of Delaware County. At its most constrained, the event attracted as many as 300 people, who gathered not only for the kind of ecumenical fellowship rarely found in the modern world outside an A. A. meeting, but, above all, to experience Mr. Schjeldahl\u2019s mythic, untamed fireworks. \u201cWe were strictly illegal, until the end,\u201d Mr. Schjeldahl told me recently. \u201cThe cops and firemen brought their families. This is libertarian country. \u201d Last year, the pyrotechnics hewed more closely to legitimacy  \u2014   a technical supervisor was even on the premises  \u2014   but that party turned out to be the last, after approximately 2, 000 people showed up, word of it having reached a vast universe of Brooklyn millennials via social media, a means of communication Mr. Schjeldahl and his wife have never employed. \u201cIt was 300 hipsters from Bushwick coming down the driveway, and I nearly died,\u201d Ms. Alderson said. Last year, guests, most of them not known to their hosts, could be overheard arguing about whether the property was a state park or a municipal park. One generation\u2019s utopia had encroached upon another\u2019s. Ominous signs began to present themselves a few years ago. Ms. Calhoun recalls entering a bedroom at the Bovina house to find a young woman she had never seen before changing into a bathing suit. On another occasion, her husband and young son were at a florist in Williamsburg where they learned that the young saleswoman behind the counter had become a regular at the party, even though she had no idea who actually held it. Even back in its more tightly circumscribed days, the party was so enormous that its hosts were hardly able to speak to everyone. One year, Mr. Schjeldahl received a warm note of thanks from Louis Menand, the literary critic and Harvard professor, who described the party as a spectacular aesthetic experience. The men had never met, not at The New Yorker, where they are colleagues, nor at the Fourth of July event. Over the years, the artists Brice and Helen Marden came, as did Steve Martin, the poet Susan Wheeler and Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys, who eventually brought Ben Stiller. The year Mr. Stiller came, he was assigned to the \u201cfront line,\u201d an assemblage of guests tasked with lighting fireworks by hand. Carmine Covelli, the drummer for a band called the Julie Ruin, was dispatched to watch over him. Mr. Stiller looked terrified, Mr. Covelli said he noted that the actor never returned. Mesmerized by Mr. Schjeldahl\u2019s obsession  \u2014   one year, he said, he strapped explosives to trees because he\u2019d seen fireworks shot horizontally from the Eiffel Tower, and grew jealous of French ingenuity  \u2014   Mr. Covelli and Mr. Horovitz began filming a documentary about the annual event. The food was the other hallmark of the party. Everyone brought something. There were maybe a hundred pies once a hunter brought bear meat. Another distinctive element was an exercise in making uptight urban parents nervous. During the day, a huge basket of bottle rockets was made available to the children who were old enough to shoot away. \u201cI know what I want when I grow up,\u201d one little boy announced to his parents as they were leaving the party, Mr. Schjeldahl recounted. \u201cA lighter. \u201d With the money they saved by calling off the party this year, Mr. Schjeldahl and Ms. Alderson went to Rome in the spring. They had a good time. This weekend, they will have two people posted on their front porch telling anyone who might not have heard that the era has ended. When Ms. Alderson realized she would need something to fill the time that months of party planning had consumed, she decided to build a miniature golf course with a Rip Van Winkle theme, a work still in progress. This weekend the couple will eat out, and they will mourn what was lost  \u2014   a sense of inclusion and ultimately a tent that just got too big.    '"}, "time": 1742562051.6932442}
