(See Steve\u2019s post here .) \\nRivers was asked by an off-camera reporter: \u201cDo you think the country \u2026 United States will see the first gay president or first woman president?\u201d \\nThis is what Joan Rivers said, sounding weary and definitely not in a joking mood: \\n\u201cWe already have [the first gay president] with Obama, so let\u2019s just calm down. You know Michelle is a tranny\u2026 a transgender. We all know. \u201c We all know. \\nOf course, by \u201cwe,\u201d Joan Rivers wasn\u2019t referring to ordinary American people, aka the sheeple who pay the taxes that (barely) holds the U.S. government together, who pay the movie tickets that maintain the Hollyweirdos in their extravagant and debauched \u201clifestyle\u201d. \\nSo who are those \u201cwe\u201d who \u201call know\u201d all along that Obama is \u201cgay\u201d and his \u201cwife\u201d Michael \u2014 oops, Michelle \u2014 is really a man? Clue No. 1 \\nRemember that Newsweek cover of May 21, 2012, proclaiming Obama to be \u201cThe First Gay President\u201d? \\nNewsweek \u2018s orgasmic cover was prompted by Obama\u2019s reversal of the military\u2019s long-standing \u201cdon\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell\u201d policy and his open support of \u201cgay marriage.\u201d \\nThe weekly magazine\u2019s accompanying cover story was written by the political pundit Andrew Sullivan, a public (i.e., outed) homosexual who wrote that Obama\u2019s support of gay marriage had brought him to tears. (Lest you get all misty-eyed sentimental, he\u2019s the same Andrew Sullivan who once said \u201cgay marriage\u201d does NOT mean monogamy. As he put it oh so delicately : \u201cthere is more likely to be greater understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.\u201d) \\nAt the time, we the sheeple thought Newsweek didn\u2019t literally mean Obama is \u201cthe first gay president\u201d. \\nThink again. \\nHomosexuals pride themselves on their gaydar. They have to, in order to find each other because homosexuals constitute only 3% of the U.S. population, according to the Williams Institute , UCLA\u2019s LGBT research think tank. That means Andrew Sullivan already knew Barack Hussein Obama is a homosexual, just as another public homosexual \u2014 conservative blogger Kevin Dujan of HillBuzz \u2014 has known all along. Clue No. 2 \\n7 months after the Newsweek cover, Candy \u2014 the first transexual style magazine \u2014 caused a brief publicity stir when it chose for its cover a transgender model, Connie Fleming, bearing a decided resemblance to Michelle Obama. (See DCG\u2019s post about this here .) \\nIn the words of Daily Mail : \u201cA striking transgender model made up to look like Michelle Obama being sworn into office has been put on the front cover of a U.S. magazine\u2026. Fleming is dressed in typical First Lady fashion, down to the pearl necklace. Even the hair style is reminiscent of President Barack Obama\u2019s wife, Michelle. \u201d \\nFor Candy to do a cover story on a transgender U.S. president is bold enough, why pick a BLACK male-to-female transgender for its cover? And not just any black MtF transgender but one who resembles Michelle? Then have the model wear a wig just like Michelle\u2019s and a sleeveless dress just like Michelle\u2019s, exposing Fleming\u2019s toned muscular arms, of which Michael Obama is so proud and for which he is celebrated by all the Obama idolators in the MSM? Clue No. 3 \\nFast forward 1\u00bd years to Time magazine\u2019s cover of June 9, 2014, proclaiming that we\u2019re at a \u201cTransgender Tipping Point: America\u2019s Next Civil Rights Frontier.\u201d (See my post, \u201c Transgender surgery now covered by bankrupt Medicare \u201c.) \\nFor its cover picture, Time could have chosen any number of transgenders \u2014 male-to-female or female-to-male; white, black, yellow, brown. \\nBut the magazine chose a BLACK male-to-female transgender, an obscure actor named Laverne Cox who also bears an uncanny resemblance to Michelle Obama. As observant FOTM commenter motherbarbarian noted: \u201cLooking at that Time cover photo, I am reminded of Michael Obama. Same sculpted arms and muscled legs.\u201d \\nWink, wink. Nudge, nudge. \\nFriends, we\u2019ve been played. \\n\u201cWe all know.\u201d They all know. \\nJoan Rivers, Andrew Sullivan, Newsweek , Candy , Time , and all the denizens of the \u201cliberal\u201d media and Hollywood have known all along. \\nSee our posts:'"}, "time": 1742628558.0262804}
