A week earlier, the queen, who is 90, missed a Christmas Day church service, for the first time since 1988, because of the illness. \u201cThe Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold,\u201d the palace said in a statement. The queen\u2019s husband, Prince Philip, who had also been ill, was well enough to attend both services, in the church at Sandringham, which is in Norfolk, on the east coast of England. The queen, who ascended to the throne in 1952, became the world\u2019s   monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October. She is also Britain\u2019s   monarch, having last year surpassed Queen Victoria\u2019s   reign. Her mother lived until the age of 101.'"}, "time": 1742628446.828724}
