The other was a shy film school student from Beijing who toiled in anonymity, sketching $20 sidewalk portraits to make the rent on his basement apartment. And though their paths crossed at more than one downtown art opening in the 1980s, it is safe to say that Ai Weiwei, the young Chinese striver, made little impression on Andy Warhol as he flitted through the adoring throngs. \u201cI remember going to a gallery opening and hearing people say \u2018Andy is here, Andy is here,\u2019 and suddenly I saw him through the crowd,\u201d Mr. Ai recalled this week, walking through \u201cAndy   Weiwei\u201d at the Warhol Museum here. \u201cIt was incredible to be in the same room, but I was a nobody. \u201d In the 25 years since he abruptly left New York to tend to his ailing father in China, Mr. Ai has become a somebody. Wily provocateur, enemy of the state and   advocate for the disenfranchised, he is a darling of the global contemporary art world, a bona fide celebrity whose burly, bearded presence invariably draws admiring crowds. Andy Warhol and Ai Weiwei, it turns out, have plenty in common. Like Warhol, Mr. Ai surrounds himself with stray cats, has a fondness for   floral arrangements and takes pleasure in subverting hallowed cultural touchstones. Both men have also made a mint turning everyday objects into   commodities. And Mr. Ai, like Warhol, compulsively records his life and surroundings  \u2014   Warhol had his tape recorder Mr. Ai always has his iPhone, which he uses almost hourly to post a deluge of images to Instagram and Twitter. But the two men are conjoined by something more significant: They are both unrepentant iconoclasts and gleeful disrupters of art world conventions. Warhol scandalized with his soup cans in 1962 three decades later, Mr. Ai defiled neolithic Chinese pottery with    paint, and he once famously smashed a Han dynasty urn just for the heck of it. \u201cThe things said about Warhol are intriguingly similar to what was said about Ai Weiwei today  \u2014   that he desecrated art,\u201d said Eric Shiner, director of the museum, which is staging a dialogue show of the two men\u2019s works that runs through August. \u201cYet in reality, both artists changed, and are changing, how the world understands art and how art penetrates the world. \u201d Such commonalities are on full display at the museum. One room juxtaposes Warhol\u2019s garishly tinted Mao Zedong with Mr. Ai\u2019s own vaguely sardonic portraits of the Great Helmsman another places Warhol\u2019s   paintings alongside a   Chinese vase that Mr. Ai scrawled with the Coke trademark logo. As he glimpsed the galleries on Thursday for the first time, Mr. Ai seemed genuinely taken aback by how Warhol had influenced his work, often unconsciously. (Mr. Ai was first exposed to the artist after arriving in New York, when he bought a   copy of Warhol\u2019s ironic quotations at The Strand.) \u201cIt\u2019s as if we were brothers,\u201d he said, noting the similarities of Warhol\u2019s early bird\u2019  ink sketches of the Manhattan skyline to his own youthful renderings of Shanghai\u2019s rooftops. \u201cWho could imagine that a poor Chinese kid would one day be showing his work alongside Andy\u2019s?\u201d The past few days have been especially emotional for Mr. Ai, who has not been here in eight years. He spent several years in internal exile after the Chinese authorities jailed him for 81 days on spurious charges of tax evasion and then refused to relinquish his passport. Last July, the police finally relented, and Mr. Ai promptly decamped to Berlin, joining his partner and their    son, who live there. In addition to lecturing at Berlin\u2019s University of the Arts  \u2014   a position he was offered just before his arrest  \u2014   he has spent the past year working at a feverish pace. His studio, which occupies an old brewery in what once was East Berlin, has become a frenetic hub, staffed by an international coterie of assistants  \u2014   not unlike Warhol\u2019s Factory. Mr. Ai also opened a studio on the Greek island of Lesbos, where he plans to build a memorial to the thousands of refugees who have died crossing the Mediterranean. And every month, it seems, there is a new exhibition of his work  \u2014   in Australia, England, Austria, and in New York. Mr. Ai has spent much of the year immersed in the migrant crisis. He has handed out   lamps to children in refugee camps, delivered a white grand piano to a traumatized Syrian pianist and photographed the freshly arrived as they scrambled off boats in Lesbos. Last month, he traveled to the West Bank and Gaza for a documentary film he is making about refugees around the world. Mr. Ai, 58, appeared exhausted by the travel, but said he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \u201cYou have to work when the light bulb is bright,\u201d he said, pointing to his head, \u201cbecause over time, it will dim. \u201d His work has not been without controversy. In February, he was widely skewered after he posed for a photograph lying on a pebble beach  \u2014   an image meant to evoke the photo of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler who drowned off the coast of Turkey. A few weeks later, during a Berlin Film Festival gala, he directed celebrity guests to don the metallic thermal blankets that volunteers give to arriving immigrants. Berlin\u2019s culture minister called the gesture \u201cobscene. \u201d Mr. Ai, unsurprisingly, is unfazed by the uproar. \u201cArt is supposed to make people feel uncomfortable, to change the way they look at the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been receiving criticism my whole life, but if you\u2019re going to throw a punch, it should be a real punch, not this kind of mediocre criticism. \u201d His work may occasionally tack to the incendiary, but in person Mr. Ai is a calm,   presence  \u2014   seemingly little changed from his days as the hungry East Village artist who threw away his paintings each time he was forced to change apartments. Dressed in a black   and cheap cloth shoes, he speaks just a notch above a whisper. As workers made   tweaks to the gallery lighting, Mr. Ai was transfixed by the wall of photos he took during his New York years: images of the 1988 riots in Tompkins Square Park a snapshot of Allen Ginsberg urinating and numerous portraits of a   and naked Mr. Ai posing like the Venus de Milo. \u201cNo one was interested in showing the work of a Chinese artist back then,\u201d he said, shaking his head, and turning to a wall of photographs documenting Warhol\u2019s 1982 trip to China. Even as Mr. Ai revels in his newfound freedom, he is mindful that the life of an exiled dissident has its drawbacks. Living in Europe, he said, has diminished his voice as a human rights advocate in China. Unlike most persecuted activists who have been given the chance to leave, Mr. Ai refuses to seek asylum. Next week, he will return to Beijing for a visit, a journey that fills him with trepidation. Mr. Ai says he wants to see family and friends, but he also wants to demonstrate to the Chinese authorities that he has not abandoned his homeland. \u201cThings there are dreadful right now,\u201d he said, referring to the unremitting government crackdown that has jailed   activists, human rights lawyers and journalists, some of them his friends. But he seemed somewhat conflicted about his role  \u2014   an exiled government critic or someone who willingly, and perhaps foolishly, steps back into the dragon\u2019s maw. \u201cIt\u2019s not honest for a real Chinese fighter to be outside,\u201d he mused. \u201cYou\u2019re just throwing stones. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563215.4774523}
