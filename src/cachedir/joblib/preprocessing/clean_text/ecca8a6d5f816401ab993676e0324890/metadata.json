Photo: RIA Novosti \\nThe political message of this year\u2019s Valdai forum was one of confidence and state-initiated reform. Leading members of Russia\u2019s political class attending the event included President Vladimir Putin, Head of the Central Election Commission Ella Pamfilova, and several key representatives of the executive and legislative branches of state power. While discussing different dimensions of Russia\u2019s development, each of them sought to stress that the country was stable and ready to move forward.  ;\\nOn the economic front, a member of the Russian government argued that Russia has now fully adjusted to the volatile international markets and is ready to operate under Western sanctions . Indeed, the overall Russian economy has benefited from sanctions. In particular, agriculture, food industry, and chemicals became important sources of overall growth. The economy\u2019s macro indicators are positive. It is now considerably less dependent on the West and is ready to progress on the basis of developing further relations with China and other non-Western nations.\\nAnother official described preparations for the country\u2019s strategic change in the direction of comprehensive economic, social and political reform. The new strategy will proceed from the need to continue the nation\u2019s integration with the global economy, while improving the quality of state governance and developing Russia\u2019s comparative advantages in the technological sector and human capital.\\nWith hundreds of experts involved, the strategy is to be completed by Spring 2017 and then be given full consideration by President Putin. Along with ideas expressed by members of the Stolypin Club, the newly prepared economic strategy is a critically important source of new thinking by the Kremlin. [The Stolypin Club, headed by Sergei Glazyev and Andrei Kaplach, is one of the two competing groups within Russia that is mapping out a future economic policy for the nation \u2013 Editor\u2019s note] Having left behind the energy-based model for growth, the Kremlin is now in search for a new model of development and is likely to be attentive to various recommendations for reform .\\nIn terms of the political system , other officials highlighted the system\u2019s newly gained legitimacy on the basis of a greater openness as demonstrated by the recent elections to the State Duma. The extremely high level of support for Putin helped to elect a parliament with the overwhelming dominance of those advocating his favored course of state-controlled reform. On the forum\u2019s sidelines, several experts speculated about the possibility of early presidential elections in Fall 2017 in order to expedite the implementation of reform.\\nIn foreign policy and international relations, Putin and other officials continued to advance the message of Russia\u2019s preparedness to work with the West on addressing common threats and challenges but not at the expense of Russia\u2019s sovereignty and national interests. Some provided detailed answers to multiple questions from the audience about specifics of the country\u2019s involvement abroad, while Putin outlined a broad vision of globalization for all, rather than some exclusive countries and population groups.\\nThese policy makers indicated that the country\u2019s interests demand standing firm for defending state sovereignty and fighting terrorism in the Middle East, implementing the Minsk agreements in Ukraine, and building a greater Eurasia in close cooperation with China and Central Asian nations.\\nIt remains to be seen whether this vision of confidence and reform will get a chance to be implemented. Obstacles \u2013 both external and domestic \u2013 are formidable. Externally, the biggest unknown is how the new U.S. administration will deal with Russia. Depending on who arrives to the White House and whether Russia is viewed as predominantly a threat or a potential partner, the U.S. policy is bound to either encourage or complicate the nation\u2019s reform efforts.\\nRecommended: \" What should Putin do next? Valdai experts offer suggestions \" Additional pressures and sanctions against the Russian economy are not likely to obtain the Kremlin\u2019s cooperation, but may well push the country away from the state-designed reforms and toward a more interventionist foreign policy and militarization of the budget.\\nAt home, the years of the West\u2019s pressures and insensitivity to Russia\u2019s interests have served to build powerful constituencies that are comfortable with Russia\u2019s siege mentality and obsessed with the alleged American threat. Putin has heavily relied on these constituencies to consolidate his control following the Ukraine crisis and will now have to work against their instincts and preferences.\\nHowever difficult it might be to practically implement it, this vision of confident reform on the basis of Russia\u2019s own priorities, values, and interests is worth serious attention. During the years that followed Western sanctions, the Kremlin demonstrated both the lack of desire to be isolated from the global economy and the power to defend its international status and interests.\\nThe opinion of the author may not necessarily reflect the position of Russia Direct or its staff. \\n'"}, "time": 1742628539.9834101}
