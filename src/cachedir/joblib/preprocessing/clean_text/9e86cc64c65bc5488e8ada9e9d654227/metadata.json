Your days of parliament are numbered, so count them well. \\nIt is probably in Theresa May\u2019s interest to never hold a general election in Britain ever again. Certainly, this choice will suit the undemocratic Remain contingent, such is their allegiance to the undemocratic EU. Share on :'"}, "time": 1742628441.8427064}
