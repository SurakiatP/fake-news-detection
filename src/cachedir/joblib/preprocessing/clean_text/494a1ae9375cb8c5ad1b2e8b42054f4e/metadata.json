Dismisses Question from RT, Says Won\u2019t Treat it Like Other Media \\nRT has asked the US State Department for specific information concerning allegations that Russia is targeting hospitals in Syria. The response was a reiteration of those allegations and a refusal to treat RT in the same way as other media outlets. \\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s State Department briefing, spokesman John Kirby accused Russia and the Syrian regime of the bombing of \u201dfive hospitals and at least one mobile clinic in Syria.\u201d RT\u2019s reporter Gayane Chichakyan asked Kirby to specify the details of the alleged incidents, including their location . \\nKirby said that he doesn\u2019t know the exact locations. \\n\u201cI\u2019m not making those accusations, I\u2019m telling you that we\u2019ve seen reports from credible aid organizations,\u201d Kirby said, refusing to clarify any details on the alleged attacks or even give the list of the \u201dmany Syrian relief agencies\u201d on which the State Department relied. \\nHe went on with his criticism of the reporter. \\n\u201cHere\u2019s a good question: Why don\u2019t you ask your Defense Ministry what they are doing? You work for Russia Today [RT], and so why shouldn\u2019t you ask your government the same kind of questions that you are asking me?\u201d Kirby told RT on Wednesday. While Chichakyan pointed out she needed specific details so that RT could inquire about the allegations, Kirby refused to elaborate. \\nThe US official\u2019s response prompted Matt Lee, a correspondent from the AP news agency, to intervene. \\n\u201cPlease be careful about saying \u2018your Defense Ministry\u2019 and things like that \u2013 she\u2019s a journalist, she\u2019s just like the rest of us are,\u201d he pointed out. \\n\u201cFrom a state-owned outlet!\u201d Kirby interrupted, adding, \u201dI\u2019m not going to put Russia Today on the same level with the rest of you who are representing independent media outlets.\u201d \\nA State Department official later apologized to Chichakyan and emailed the reporter a detailed statement with the locations of the allegedly bombed hospitals originally sent by \u201cHEALTH CLUSTER TURKEY HUB / Health Cluster partners & NPM.\u201d \\nThe statement said three hospitals were hit by airstrikes in Atarib, outside Aleppo, while two hospitals and a mobile clinic were hit in the Idlib province, resulting in several reported deaths and injuries and rendering the medical facilities out of service. \\nIt did not, however, lay blame on any party for the alleged strikes. \\nEarlier on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Elizabeth Trudeau accused Russia of striking \u201cfive hospitals and one mobile clinic in Syria,\u201d without specifying the source of information. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry has strongly denied these allegations. \\n\u201cWe do not know where Elizabeth Trudeau gets information about what is happening in Syria. Her repeating rumors about some \u2018five hospitals\u2019 and \u2018one mobile clinic\u2019 which were \u2018bombed\u2019 only confirms the fact that all the State Department\u2019s public rhetoric on the situation in Syria is based on blatant lies,\u201d Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said at a Tuesday briefing. \\nAs of Wednesday, Russia has not launched any airstrikes in Aleppo for 29 days, according to the Defense Ministry. Russian jets are currently flying sorties in Idlib and Homs provinces, striking only verified terrorist infrastructure , namely factories and arms depots. \u2018Unprofessional, borders on incompetence\u2019 \\nLarry Johnson, a retired CIA and State Department official, criticized Kirby\u2019s behavior during the briefing, saying that his treatment of RT\u2019s correspondent was \u201cso unprofessional\u201d that it \u201cborders on incompetence.\u201d \\nJohnson says that the proper way for Kirby, who \u201crelays the assentation of an unnamed group\u201d to handle the situation, would be to calmly explain that he was not able to name the locations at the moment. \\nWhile the accusations thrown at Russia stem from \u201chighly suspect\u201d sources of information, they fit the narrative of Russia\u2019s demonization in the US media, Johnson said. \\n\u201cI have never seen this kind of hysteria against Russia in the United States, ever\u2026 the extreme statements, the insults directed at President Putin and at Russia in general, the notion that the United States can conduct military operation at the Russian border at will,\u201d Johnson said, adding that it should not come as a surprise that such rhetoric causes serious concerns in Russia. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s emotional, it\u2019s not rational, it\u2019s nothing that can be explained by reason,\u201d he added, voicing hopes that President-elect Donald Trump will review this approach and opt for cooperation with Russia instead. \\nIn contrast, constant rebel shelling in Syria causing mass civilians casualties continues to go largely unnoticed in Washington, Johnson argues, saying that it appears that for the US government \u201cthe other side doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \\nSpeaking about Kirby\u2019s attempt to justify his conduct toward RT\u2019s correspondent by pointing out that RT is funded by the Russian state, Johnson regarded it as an odd argument, as the same is true for many major media outlets, for instance, BBC. At the same time, Johnson believes that US mainstream media is failing to do its job properly and seems to be \u201cin the pocket of this [Obama] administration.\u201d \\n\u201cThey are not even asking basic critical fundamental questions, they accepting assertions by the administration at face value, not challenging, not questioning,\u201d he said.
