[\u201cThere are studies that show sex is healthy,\u201d   Muskos, a    city councillor for the northern town of Overtornea, told AFP after presenting the motion.  He said couples were not spending enough time with each other in today\u2019s society. \u201cIt\u2019s about having better relationships,\u201d he said. He noted there was no way to verify that employees do not use their hour for other purposes than spending time with their partners or spouses. \u201cYou can\u2019t guarantee that a worker doesn\u2019t go out for a walk instead,\u201d Muskos said, adding that employers needed to trust their employees. Muskos said he \u201csaw no reason\u201d why the motion wouldn\u2019t pass. After the Finns and the French, Swedish   employees worked the least in Europe with only 1, 685 hours on average in 2015, according to a study by economic research institute  . Brits worked an average of 1, 900 hours and Germans 1, 847 hours in 2015.'"}, "time": 1742628445.7290072}
