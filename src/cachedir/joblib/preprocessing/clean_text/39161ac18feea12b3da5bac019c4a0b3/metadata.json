Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, also hailed the Senate\u2019s vote to confirm Gorsuch. \u201cJudge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation is Exhibit A for the argument that advocates for life and religious liberty need to vote,\u201d said Pavone. \u201cWithout the active participation of social conservatives in last year\u2019s elections, today we would be looking at a Supreme Court dominated by extreme   justices. Instead, there\u2019s great hope for the future. \u201d Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the Supreme Court vacancy after the sudden death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia \u201cbecame a defining issue of the 2016 presidential election. \u201d \u201cPresident Trump made history by telling voters who he would appoint to the Court by providing a list  \u2014   the American people chose him and he in turn chose from the list, keeping his promise,\u201d Perkins added. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation is \u201ca huge win for the Trump administration and for the   movement. \u201d \u201cStudents for Life commends President Trump for keeping his promise to appoint a judge in the mold of the late Justice Scalia, and we look forward to the day when abortion on demand, in all nine months of pregnancy is no longer the law of the land,\u201d she said. Maureen Ferguson, senior policy adviser with The Catholic Association, said Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation will help to correct the \u201calarming erosion\u201d of the First Amendment right to practice one\u2019s faith without discrimination. \u201cSenate Republicans have restored the true tradition of confirming justices without filibusters and the   of recent years,\u201d she added.'"}, "time": 1742561650.5878367}
