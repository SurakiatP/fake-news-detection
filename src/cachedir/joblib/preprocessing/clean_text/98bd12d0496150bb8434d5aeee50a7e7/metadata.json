Louis Gohmert ( ) said that if anyone interfered with the 2016 presidential election, it wasn\u2019t the Russians but the Department of Justice.  He specifically named former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former FBI Director James Comey. Gohmert referred to Comey\u2019s testimony last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee where he said Lynch had told him to refer to the FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information as a \u201cmatter,\u201d rather than an \u201cinvestigation,\u201d even though Clinton was under investigation. Comey said that led him to publicly announce the end of the Clinton investigation in July 2016. \u201cAt best, it was an attempt to manipulate the election, not by the Russians in this case, but by the Department of Justice  \u2014   the Attorney General herself  \u2014   because that came from Comey,\u201d  Gohmert said. \u201c[Comey] totally ruined his own credibility  \u2014   or what was left of it,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cHe did vast damage and raised big red flags and questions over Loretta Lynch\u2019s job as head of the Justice Department. \u201c[Lynch] was using her official position to help the campaign of Hillary Clinton and that didn\u2019t seem to bother him enough to do a memo,\u201d Gohmert said. Gohmert said this should be the subject of a congressional investigation. \u201cWe need to round up all those people [Comey] talked to  \u2014   because we have a conspiracy remaining afoot in the Department of Justice that is going to be out to destroy this president and they\u2019ve got to be fired if not worse. \u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter @PennyStarrDC'"}, "time": 1742563146.629834}
