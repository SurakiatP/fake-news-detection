Trump has emboldened conservative thinkers to press their party of business and the privileged to reshape its economic canon to more directly benefit poorer workers it has often taken for granted. The policy prescriptions of these   reform conservatives, or \u201creformocons,\u201d would not only break with some longtime Republican orthodoxy  \u2014   disavowing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich, for example  \u2014   they would also counter more recent stances by Mr. Trump on trade and immigration. And because of a lack of policy specifics in Mr. Trump\u2019s   campaign, reform conservatives see an opening through which to push their prescriptions. \u201cWhat it means to be a conservative is up for grabs,\u201d said Reihan Salam, the executive editor of the conservative National Review. Whether Mr. Trump prevails or the party is left to rebuild from defeat, these conservatives in think tanks, advocacy groups and the news media  \u2014   and a few in political office  \u2014   will be pressing for a new agenda: to update the   playbook with an eye to   voters without a college education who form the Republican base. Ronald Reagan\u2019s notions that policies that benefit the rich and big business lift all incomes now appear outmoded in an era of rising wealth inequality and stagnant wages. The challenge to the party could be every bit as contentious as Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent has been. Beyond conservative think tanks and activist circles, the new breed of conservatives has not made significant inroads among House Republicans, for instance. And even these Republicans do not agree on everything. But some common ideas suggest their proposed road map for the party: \u2022 Reject additional tax cuts for those making more than $250, 000 a year, but expand breaks for   and   workers through tax credits for children, the   tax credit or a new wage subsidy using tax dollars to bring low wages toward the local median level. \u2022 Promote the benefits of global trade agreements, but help displaced workers. \u2022 Rule out fully privatizing Social Security and Medicare, and reassure workers they will be exempt from  . \u2022 Acknowledge that universal health care is here to stay, but push for   changes. \u2022 Disavow mass deportations and promote the economic benefits of legalizing longtime workers who are in the country illegally, but reduce the legal entry of   immigrants. \u201cWhat we have going on right now, and Trump\u2019s position in the Republican Party, makes this recalibration that much more important, that much more urgent,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. \u201cSome within the party,\u201d he added, \u201chave been all too willing to wear the label of the Republican Party as being the party of Wall Street, or the party of the top 1 percent. \u201d Although most of them oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy  \u2014   Mr. Salam called him \u201can overwhelmingly noxious and negative force\u201d  \u2014   these conservatives do credit him with engaging   voters and dealing them into the economic conversation. \u201cThe biggest thing that Trump offers these voters is finally somebody paying attention,\u201d said Henry Olsen, a scholar at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. \u201cImagine that they\u2019re the wallflowers at the high school dance and they\u2019re sitting off, ignored by everybody. Suddenly, the football hero comes up and says, \u2018Come dance with me.\u2019 That\u2019s intoxicating. \u201d Led by younger conservatives, the push for new approaches began in the past decade, as big spending and military interventions by the Bush administration and a   Congress vexed many in the party. Capturing the ferment was a 2008 book, \u201cGrand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream,\u201d by Mr. Salam and Ross Douthat, who is now a columnist for The New York Times. \u201cThe Trump phenomenon has really opened things up  \u2014   people are more inclined to listen, elites within the party are more inclined to listen,\u201d said Mr. Salam, who, with Mr. Douthat, recently updated their book\u2019s theme in an opinion article in The Times. The authors wrote in their   that Mr. Trump\u2019s white   supporters were \u201cclearly voting against a party leadership that pays them lip service while ignoring their concerns\u201d  \u2014   a revulsion that will not disappear even if Mr. Trump does. Proponents of a new conservative agenda have critics in both parties. Democrats dismiss their ideas as repackaging a familiar   agenda. Some Republicans and conservative media figures like Rush Limbaugh condemn their cause as a return of moderate Republicanism or a capitulation to liberalism. Michael A. Needham, the chief executive of Heritage Action for America, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, said reform conservatives and Tea   organizations like his are allies in their desire to rewrite a \u201cstale\u201d economic agenda tilted to Republican donors. But he acknowledged differences in tactics and substance. His group and its allies favor conflict, like government shutdowns, for instance. And they still want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut taxes for everyone. Yet conservative agitators were mostly talking among themselves until Mr. Trump toppled the party establishment, along the way flouting longstanding party dogma on taxes, trade and immigration. Democrats have long charged that   white Americans who vote heavily Republican do so against their economic interests. A new poll for The Wall Street Journal and NBC News had Hillary Clinton ahead over all but trailing Mr. Trump by 13 percentage points among whites without a college education and by 21 points among men in that group. Past polls had her even further behind with those   voters, however. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d last week that the Democratic Party bore some responsibility. While its policies may be geared toward workers, he said, \u201cThe Democratic Party over all hasn\u2019t spoken enough to those voters\u201d  \u2014   the \u201cordinary people busting their necks. \u201d It was an echo of the Republican   now playing out. For all of Mr. Trump\u2019s outreach to   whites, Robert VerBruggen, the managing editor of The American Conservative, said the party platform that emerged from the Republican convention was further evidence of the gap between the party\u2019s support from white   workers and its agenda that all but ignores them. \u201cThe breakdown of the working class was neglected,\u201d he wrote in his magazine. \u201cThere seems to have been little discussion of the economic anxieties of working families, the safety net or the drug epidemic sweeping rural America. \u201d \u201cInstead,\u201d Mr. VerBruggen wrote, \u201ctheir focus on the bottom half of the economic spectrum seems to have been limited to a debate about the purchase of unhealthy snacks with food stamps. \u201d Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the former domestic policy director for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, even suggested that Republicans look for ways to harness labor unions for constructive   relationships. He also predicted more openness among conservatives to raising taxes when justified. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine the Grover Norquist tax pledge having the salience it once did,\u201d Mr. Cass said, referring to the longstanding   vow that most Republican candidates take. \u201cThat model of \u2018no tax increases, ever, under any circumstances\u2019 I think is probably on its way out or gone. \u201d Mr. Norquist scoffed at the suggestion. \u201cThe pledge came out in \u201986,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery six months from then somebody has said, \u2018Oh, the pledge won\u2019t hold.\u2019 \u201d It is, he added, \u201cnonnegotiable. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564208.4166381}
