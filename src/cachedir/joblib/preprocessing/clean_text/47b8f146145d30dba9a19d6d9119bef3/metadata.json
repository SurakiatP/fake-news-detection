But a sketch lampooning Sean M. Spicer, the White House press secretary, in which he was impersonated by Melissa McCarthy, the comic actress and a surprise guest star, stole the show as \u201cS. N. L. \u201d continued to take swings at a president who delights in hitting back. In the show\u2019s cold open, Alec Baldwin returned for another outing as Mr. Trump, phoning up other world leaders under the guidance of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon (actually an \u201cS. N. L. \u201d cast member dressed as the Grim Reaper). As Mr. Trump, Mr. Baldwin first called Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia (Beck Bennett) who reminded him that President Barack Obama promised to receive 1, 200 refugees held in detention in Australia. \u201cNo refugees,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said hastily. \u201cAmerica first, Australia sucks. Your reef is failing. Prepare to go to war. \u201d He went on to call President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico (\u201cGuy who\u2019s going to pay for the wall says what? \u201d) Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany (\u201cI\u2019m going to write a memoir about this struggle, and call it \u2018My Struggle\u2019  \u2014   what would that be in German? \u201d) and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Mr. Mugabe (Kenan Thompson) was not impressed or intimidated: \u201cI will rip out your spine and drink from your skull,\u201d he told Mr. Baldwin. In her opening monologue, Ms. Stewart, the show\u2019s host, recalled a period in 2012 when Mr. Trump posted several tweets about the relationship she had with her \u201cTwilight\u201d   Robert Pattinson. (In one tweet Mr. Trump wrote that Ms. Stewart \u201ccheated on him like a dog  will do it again,\u201d and in another he invited Mr. Pattinson to attend the Miss Universe pageant.) \u201cTo be fair,\u201d Ms. Stewart said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump hated me. I think he\u2019s in love with my boyfriend. \u201d She added, \u201cThe president is not a huge fan of me. But that is so O. K. And Donald, if you didn\u2019t like me then, you\u2019re really probably not going to like me now. Because I\u2019m hosting S. N. L. and I\u2019m, like, so gay, dude. \u201d Still, the night belonged to Ms. McCarthy, the star of \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d who came out in thinning blond hair and an   suit to play an aggressive,   version of Mr. Spicer as he led a daily White House press briefing. \u201cI know that myself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start,\u201d she said, starting off the session. \u201cWhen I say rocky start, I mean it in the sense of \u2018Rocky,\u2019 the movie, because I came out here to punch you in the face. And also I don\u2019t talk so good. \u201d As Mr. Spicer, Ms. McCarthy then told the press corps she would be \u201capologizing, on behalf of you, to me, for how you have treated me these last two weeks. \u201d \u201cAnd that apology is not accepted,\u201d she added. Discussing Mr. Trump\u2019s recent announcement that he would nominate Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Ms. McCarthy said, \u201cThe crowd greeted him with a standing ovation, which lasted a full 15 minutes. And you can check the tape on that. Everyone was smiling. Everyone was happy. The men all had erections, and every single one of the women was ovulating left and right. And no one, no one was sad. Those are the facts forever. \u201d An addled Ms. McCarthy then read her own email password, and tangled with a New York Times reporter (played by Bobby Moynihan) who asked why Mr. Trump did or did not use the word \u201cban\u201d when describing his executive order prohibiting travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. \u201cYou just said that,\u201d she told the reporter. \u201cHe\u2019s quoting you. It\u2019s your words. He\u2019s using your words, when you use the words and he uses them back, it\u2019s circular using of the word and that\u2019s from you. \u201d When a Wall Street Journal reporter simply asked, \u201cAre you O. K.?\u201d Ms. McCarthy charged at her with her podium and threatened, \u201cI will put you in the corner with CNN. \u201d (The screen then showed a CNN reporter in a cage.) Mr. Trump has posted complaints and criticisms of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d on his Twitter account over the past several months, though he has not weighed in on the show in the weeks since his inauguration. (Nor, as of this writing, has Mr. Spicer.) Mr. Baldwin, whose impression of Mr. Trump has often been a target of the president\u2019s ire, is scheduled to host \u201cS. N. L. \u201d next Saturday, Feb. 11.'"}, "time": 1742563534.2089064}
