Trump has been condemned by civil rights groups, Democrats and some Republicans, because of Mr. Bannon\u2019s record as chairman of Breitbart News, the   news and opinion site. Here, in his own words, are a selection of Mr. Bannon\u2019s public statements about the country, the Republican Party and his own political philosophy. \u2022 \u201cFear is a good thing. Fear is going to lead you to take action,\u201d he said in a 2010 interview. \u2022 Referring to Ann Coulter, Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin in a 2011 radio interview on Political Vindication Radio, he said: \u201cThese women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative. That\u2019s why there are some unintended consequences of the women\u2019s liberation movement. That, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be   they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn\u2019t be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England. That drives the left insane, and that\u2019s why they hate these women. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Bannon made a movie in 2012 about the Occupy Wall Street protests. He told an interviewer: \u201cAfter making the Occupy movie, when you finish watching the film, you want to take a hot shower. You want to go home and shower because you\u2019ve just spent an hour and 15 minutes with the greasiest, dirtiest people you will ever see. \u201d \u2022 \u201cI think anger is a good thing,\u201d he told a gathering of conservatives in Washington in 2013, according to a profile in The Atlantic. \u201cThis country is in a crisis. And if you\u2019re fighting to save this country, if you\u2019re fighting to take this country back, it\u2019s not going to be sunshine and patriots. It\u2019s going to be people who want to fight. \u201d \u2022 \u201cI\u2019m a Leninist,\u201d Mr. Bannon was quoted as saying by a writer for The Daily Beast who met him at a party in 2014. He later said he did not recall the conversation. \u201cLenin wanted to destroy the state, and that\u2019s my goal, too,\u201d the site quoted him as saying. \u201cI want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today\u2019s establishment. \u201d \u2022 \u201cWhat we need to do is   the Republican Party,\u201d he said in a 2010 radio interview on Political Vindication Radio. \u2022 \u201cWe don\u2019t believe there is a functional conservative party in this country, and we certainly don\u2019t think the Republican Party is that,\u201d he told the same gathering. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an insurgent,   populist movement that is virulently   and it\u2019s going to continue to hammer this city, both the progressive left and the institutional Republican Party. \u201d \u2022 \u201cThere is a growing global   revolt against the permanent political class at home, and the global elites that influence them, which impacts everyone from Lubbock, Tex. to London, England,\u201d he said in a 2014 interview in The New York Times. \u2022\u201cLet the grassroots turn on the hate because that\u2019s the ONLY thing that will make them do their duty,\u201d he wrote about Republican leaders in a 2014 email exchange with a Breitbart News editor. The emails were obtained by The Daily Beast. \u2022 \u201cWe call ourselves \u2018the Fight Club.\u2019 You don\u2019t come to us for warm and fuzzy,\u201d Mr. Bannon told The Washington Post this year. \u201cWe think of ourselves as virulently   particularly \u2018 \u2019 the permanent political class. We say Paul Ryan was grown in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation. \u201d Mr. Bannon  took over Breitbart News in 2012 after the death of its founder, Andrew Breitbart, and shifted it further to the right. Critics, including some conservatives formerly associated with it, have denounced Breitbart in its current incarnation as a hate site steeped in misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, white nationalism and  .
