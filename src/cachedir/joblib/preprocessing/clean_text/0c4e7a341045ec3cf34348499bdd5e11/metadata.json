Recipient Name Recipient Email => \\nI\u2019ve written a couple pieces of the smoking hot issue in Pivotland, Philippine president Duterte\u2019s swerve toward a pro-PRC foreign policy, and what the U.S. and pro-American sector of the Manila elite are going to do about it. \\nThe first piece, Reports of death of US-Philippine alliance may be exaggerated , addresses the fact that Duterte\u2019s freedom of movement is constrained by the need to keep the Philippine military happy, and notes that ex-prez and retired general Fidel Ramos, who facilitated Duterte\u2019s entrance on the national political stage, is signaling dissatisfaction with Duterte. \\nThe second piece, Duterte Plays the \u2018Mamasapano\u2019 Card , covers a Duterte counter-attack: a threat to relitigate the death of 44 Philippine National Police commandos at Mamasapano in Mindanao, a 2014 special ops fiasco conducted under the aegis of the United States which a) exposes ex-president Aquino to serious legal jeopardy b) posits that the US alliance is doing a better job of killing Filipinos than the PRC can ever hope to do. \\nThe US seems to be embedded in a colonial mindset when it comes to the Philippines, something along the lines of \u201cwe\u2019ve been selflessly looking after the Philippines for a century, and that thug Duterte won\u2019t be allowed to screw that up during his brief (maybe curtailed) presidency.\u201d \\nIt takes a pretty superficial view of Philippine history, one that accepts the US self-definition as the Philippines\u2019 security savior while ignoring the distortions and shortcomings of the colonial and neo-colonial relationship. \\nFor me this tunnel vision was typified by the US media crowing over the formal delivery of a refurbished C-130 transport to the Philippine government by outgoing ambo Philip Goldberg. Message: here\u2019s the US making provisions for Philippine defense at the same time Duterte\u2019s selling out the country to China. \\nTo me, the inadvertent message was 1) here\u2019s the US blindly stroking the pivot fetish while Duterte tries to solve the Mindanao insurgency that has cost at least 400,000 lives over the last century, win his drug war, and find a place for the Philippines in Asia that doesn\u2019t give primacy to the US preoccupation confronting the PRC and 2) the U.S., in my opinion, pretty much has a policy of keeping the Philippines flat on its behind as an independent military force by trickling out second-hand gear to the Philippine military while the sweet stuff is dangled in front of it during US joint military maneuvers and port calls. \\nBut the United States is trying to find political leverage wherever it can and the Western media will, I\u2019m sure, put its shoulder to the wheel to help out. \\nPhilip Goldberg sat down for a 45-minute exit interview with Rappler . As befitting Rappler\u2019s origins in the Soros/Omidyar network of pro-US globalization advocacy, the interview was a stream of softballs about what to do about Duterte\u2019s disregard of the awesomeness of the American relationship, an awesomeness that is acknowledged by virtually all Filipinos who inexplicably (and, if the US has anything to do about it, temporarily) at the same time give Duterte approval ratings of over 80% . \\nIt\u2019s worth watching if you have the patience. Goldberg is a smooth cat, and the Rappler tonguebath gives you no inkling of the fact that he intimately familiar with the wet work of end-arounding national governments to cultivate secessionist movements, you know, like what he did in Bolivia (declared persona non grata as a result) and Kosovo, and like that thing in Duterte\u2019s home province of Mindanao, which in my opinion probably the main reason why Duterte wanted him out of the Philippines. \\nGoldberg also discretely plays the economic threat card, concern-trolling that anti-US attitudes will dismay \u201cforeign investors\u201d. \\nIt will be interesting to see how this plays out in subsequent weeks. As far as I can tell, the biggest U.S. factor in the domestic Philippine economy is the call-center industry . I doubt US corporations are interested in actually pulling their operations out and subjecting them to the English-language mercies of India, but certainly a call from the State Department or White House would convince them of the wisdom of at least making the threat. \\nAnd I also wonder if expected President Hillary Clinton will find it necessary to drop the hammer on Duterte, in order to demonstrate to a rather dubious Asia that there is no alternative to loyalty to the pivot. \\nI expect the next few months, in other words, to be very interesting.
