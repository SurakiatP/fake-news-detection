[\u201cI know and have worked with Attorney General Sessions. He has said he had no discussions with Russian officials regarding the election, and I take him at his word. Part of the job of a United States Senator involves talking to the ambassadors of countries,\u201d Blunt said in a statement.  \u201cI\u2019ve talked to at least twenty ambassadors in the last six weeks. It would have been very normal for Sessions, as a senator, to have talked to the Russian ambassador without discussing the election,\u201d Blunt said in a statement. An aide said the Russian ambassador was not one of the 20. Sen. Tom Cotton ( ) a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also defended Sessions. \u201cAnyone who knows Jeff Sessions as I do can vouch for his integrity and honesty. There\u2019s no scandal in a senator meeting an ambassador, which happens all the time,\u201d he said. The Russian Embassy in Washington told Breitbart News on Thursday that the embassy \u201cdoesn\u2019t comment on numerous contacts with local partners, which occur on a daily basis in line with diplomatic practice. \u201d The Washington Post reported Wednesday evening that Sessions had spoken with the Kislyak twice last year  \u2014   once briefly after a Heritage Foundation event in July on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention that about 50 ambassadors attended, and another time in his office in September. At Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearing as attorney general, Sen. Al Franken  ( ) asked Sessions, then still the Alabama Republican senator, specifically about an \u201cexchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government. \u201d FRANKEN: CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the   last week, that included information that \u2018Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.\u2019 These documents also allegedly say \u2018there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.\u2019 Again, I\u2019m telling you this as it\u2019s coming out, so you know. But if it\u2019s true, it\u2019s obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do? SESSIONS: Senator Franken, I\u2019m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I\u2019m unable to comment on it. A spokeswoman for Sessions, Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, released a statement: There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer. Last year, the Senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign  \u2014   not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee. Democrats are calling for Sessions to resign, or recuse himself from any investigation into Russian involvement in the U. S. elections. They have also called for an independent review, outside of a current review being conducted by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Blunt said the best place to determine the facts is the committee: The Senate Intelligence Committee is the best place to determine the facts regarding Russian involvement in our elections. Certainly the Russian government\u2019s pattern in recent Eastern European elections continues today in France and Germany. Finding out exactly what the Russian government did or assisted in during our elections can help protect the democratic process in other countries as well as ours. He said it would take \u201cat least six months\u201d for any new investigation to get to where the intelligence committee is now. \u201cI intend to go to CIA headquarters in the next week to look at all the documents and reports myself,\u201d he said. \u201cOur investigation should talk to everyone that any reasonable person would think should be talked to, and look at any material a reasonable person would think should be looked at. \u201d Cotton agreed: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed the Democrats are distorting the facts to impugn Attorney General Sessions\u2019s character. The Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s review is proceeding, and we should follow the facts where they lead. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563975.9135766}
