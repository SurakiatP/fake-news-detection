He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 11, 2016 Culture \\nThe existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever. Many are those who contend for public attention, credibility, and money as a reward for their wits, not to mention the very status of intellectual. Yet the existence of such people is far from self-evident. For centuries, traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals, and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years. \\nSo, as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the Empire of Nothing\u2014a necessary step if we want a lasting victory\u2014an important question must be confronted: do we need at all what has been called \u201cintellectuals\u201d during last centuries? And if we do not, what should we have instead? The origin of modern intellectuals \\nAt the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis. Before it, Western Europe was united by the same Christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economy\u2014subordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer. \\nWhen modernity reared its philosophical head through Ren\u00e9 Descartes, a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century, the Old Continent was in a much more problematic state: Christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core. We have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence. But, in fact, thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression. \\nThe Irish bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753) criticized how the practice of philosophy had become, on his age, synonymous with getting embroiled into \u201cthousand scruples\u2026 prejudices and errors of sense,\u201d a situation he attributed to \u201cthe wrong use we make of our faculties.\u201d Likewise, the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-1776) scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the \u201csystems\u201d of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene, that is, a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything: \\nThere is nothing which is not the subject of debate, and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions. The most trivial question escapes not our controversy, and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision. Disputes are multiplied, as if everything was uncertain; and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth, as if everything was certain. Amidst all this bustle it is not reason, which carries the prize, but eloquence\u2026 From hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds. \\nThe first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis. Descartes, Berkeley, Hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies. But soon the very controversy became an institution. A whole market of ideas was growing, in which more and more lettr\u00e9s started to see an opportunity to make a name, thus earning fame, social standing and sometimes money. Hume could not help himself: soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others\u2019 \u201csystems\u201d while promoting their own, he was doing the same. \\nSuch was the so-called Enlightenment: the further undermining of any spiritual, philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety. They would be experts at flattering the powerful, mocking the Catholic church, fiddle fashionable themes and \u201cwitty\u201d prose, and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a \u201cprogress.\u201d The very expression \u201cEnlightenment\u201d stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity. The intellectuals\u2019 bread and butter \\nIt can be noted that, from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century, generations of scientists have sprang up. Some of these characters were mathematicians, engineers, doctors, or dedicated observers of nature, and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter . But make no mistake: even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research, thus following a headlong rush dynamic. At its side, the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them. \\nThe momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern West. Where God ceased to speak, the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress. It doesn\u2019t matter if problems are genuine or artificial. Intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron. \\nTwo typical intellectual characters are Voltaire and \u00c9mile Zola. Both were gifted writers, both were charming and witty, both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times, and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves. (Not so incidentally, both were French and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism.) \\nVoltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were Protestants inside a Catholic country. The infamous affaire Calas , from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son, was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society, stirring the public opinion, pressuring magistrates, until the father\u2014who had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigation\u2014was rehabilitated. Two centuries and a half later, young Frenchmen are still taught Voltaire was a champion of truth, justice, and reason, whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence. \\nZola, more than a century later, did the same. A Jewish-French captain, Alfred Dreyfus , was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to Prussia. Years later, some new evidence seemed to indicate that Dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents: at this very moment, Zola published an incendiary article, J\u2019accuse , where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire . Eventually, Dreyfus was rehabilitated\u2014and the army, the patriots and the Catholics were shamed through a never-ending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story. \\nVoltaire and Zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind. We are taught about a situation of injustice, where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions. Fortunately, a heroic talking head rises, miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such, the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as \u201coppressors,\u201d and the poor victim\u2019s rehabilitation is also the victory of reason, justice, and progress. \\nThus, the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions. Teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion\u2026 provided they follow a mysterious sense of history. There have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics, and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside. Who\u2019s gonna pay? \\nEven if you are gifted with words and language, being a talking head does not pay much. Would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion, no matter how elaborate, on anything? The problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots: Voltaire was close from wealthy Protestants bankers, one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in Geneva, and Zola was a Rotschild prot\u00e9g\u00e9 . Both of them contributed to tarnish Catholicism and most of their own people. In other words, they served interests that could pay them\u2014they were sellouts. \\nToday, some bloggers happen to earn money as independents, especially when they found themselves a niche. Yet independence is scarce. Way too many people would like to live from their wits, and, even more, obtain recognition as intellectuals. More than often, intellectual types turn into teachers, journalists, or even marketers\u2014thus depending upon an institution that pays them. \\nIn North America, the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized , whether in the academic or in the media. You won\u2019t easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural Marxism. And in case you wouldn\u2019t be self-hating enough, they are already replacing you with \u201cminority\u201d individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily. \\nOld Marxism was well-aligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class, not as individuals. It handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of \u201cprogress.\u201d Keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated State where model-obsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth. Intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status, money, and moral recognition. \\nBut the whole Marxist vocabulary of \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cemancipation\u201d dissimulated what seems glaring today. Namely, that intellectuals were recognized and paid, not because they were enlightened or bright, but because they were an efficient tool of destruction. \\nThe conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types. The average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite. Such a lack pushed a number of high IQs to the arms of the left, who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism, anti-whiteness, anti-masculinity, pathological altruism, transgender madness, \u201cpolitically correct\u201d repression and so on. Intellectuals were never paid to say the truth: they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function. \\nIf we happen to beat cultural Marxism, what shall we do with intellectual types? If we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies, we have to think about what we will replace the bobo -leftist establishment. The intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution. A truly traditional society would likely have initiates, something akin to high priests and knights, in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers. How exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question. Conclusion \\nThe French essayist Alain Soral once famously said, \u201ca journalist is either a whore or without a job.\u201d This is even truer for most intellectuals, sold as they are to a destructive left or (more seldomly) to the inefficient right. \\nCulture is overrated. What the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix, full of lies, taboos, and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit. No wonder why the shrewd Robert Greene advised to be an \u201cintense realist\u201d: one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream \u201cculture.\u201d \\nThe previous generations could join the cultural Marxist establishment and pretend their destructive, ego-laden works were progress. To our generation, this is impossible. Either we stand up for our very existence, even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies, or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death. Before we take the power back, a shared awareness must be stimulated, and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the well-funded anti-white, anti-masculine establishment types, whom we must beat on their own field once and for all. Bonus: 6 quotes about the intellectuels \\nSome of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning. [Modern philosophy] features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints. These issues only exist because they are poorly framed. They have no fundamental reason to exist. In many cases, defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear, plain and simple, if [modern] philosophy did not strive to maintain them, because it makes a living out of ambiguity. \u2014 Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, Introduction to the study of the Hindu doctrines , chap.8. Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non (young) \\nPhilosophers care much more about putting forth problems, no matter how artificial and illusory, than about solving them\u2026 They also strive to link their name to a \u2018system,\u2019 that is, to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work. Hence the desire to be original at any price, even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality. A philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others. \u2014Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, The Crisis of the Modern World , chap.5. Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non (older) \\nThe most evident feature of [modern] critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity. Its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant, in appearing original\u2026 From the point of view of those who embody this \u2018intellectuality,\u2019 the catchy line, the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others, have a much greater value than truth. Ideas, when they use them, are nothing but a pretext. What matters is to look intelligent\u2014just as, to the mainstream politician, the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career. The \u2018vanity fair,\u2019 the most deleterious subjectivism, often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism, are essential components of this phenomenon\u2026 The \u2018critique\u2019 is a scourge of modern culture, an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture\u2026 In normal, traditional civilizations, one could find creators, artists, and those who would judge the works without intermediaries: the sovereigns, the patrons, and the people. Our times have witnessed the appearance, between the public and the creators, that cultural pimp, that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a \u2018critique.\u2019 \u2014 Julius Evola, The Bow and the Club Baron Giulio Cesare Evola \\nShow me more venal, more insensitive, more corrupt minds than those of the literate caste! How many of them do you know whose virtue would still be uncorrupted? Who, but them, for over thirty years, kept flooding us with a loosened morale, a disdain for work, a disgust of duty, a disrespect for family, who but the literary? Who dipped into secret funds more shamelessly than they did? Who seduced women, softened the young, excited the nation to more debauchery than they did? Who did abandon cowardly the princes after begging for their favours\u2026? So-called men of letters, always! They run like harlots between the legitimate government and usurpers, between monarchy and republic, between politics and socialism, between atheism and religion. Everything is good to them as long as they can make a profit and be fashionable out of it. \u2014 Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (quoted by the following one) Pierre-Joseph Proudon \\nCompare, for example, seventeenth century writers with those of the eighteenth. What a difference in tone and gait! The former, under a veneer of servility, have the most noble and proud stance\u2026 They do not pretend to reign. They merely stand at their place, recognize the place of a superior power beyond, give themselves completely to their writing task, dismiss the temptation of advertising and demonstrate their professional dedication. On the other hand, look at the Voltaire, Diderot and the like: they open well the era of intellectuals, writing stooges as they are, courtiers of princes they flatter and despise at the same time\u2014something they are forced to do as they want to usurp their power\u2026 Their courtier nature reveals in everything they do\u2026 The whole eighteenth century, both spiritual and plain on a scoundrel background, is libertine, and already pornographic: such is the start of literary mercantilism; people of letters make money out of their writings, pretend to financial independence, and they write garbage to flatter the opinion of their public. \u2014 \u00c9douard Berth, Les m\u00e9faits des intellectuels (\u201cthe misdeeds of the intellectuals\u201d), Introduction \u00c9douard Berth (disciple of Proudhon) \\nI have had the same experience with journalists citing each other about my books without the smallest effort to go to my writings\u2014my experience is that most journalists, professional academics, and other in similar phony professions don\u2019t read original sources, but each other, largely because they need to figure out the consensus before making a pronouncement. \u2014 Nassim Taleb, Antifragile , chap.23.'"}, "time": 1742562365.8863018}
