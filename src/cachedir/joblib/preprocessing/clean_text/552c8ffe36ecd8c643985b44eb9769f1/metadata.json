But his \u201csociological clock\u201d  \u2014   his sense that he was missing out on something important in life  \u2014   boomed mightily. At the age of 54, he decided to do something about it. He became a father. He was single, but so what? \u201cI decided I could either do it myself, or wait for the right partner to come along,\u201d said Mr. Campanella, a Los Angeles fine arts photographer whose son, Rhys, is a little over 1 year old. Over the years he had dated women who had children of their own, but he realized that he didn\u2019t want to be a stepdad. \u201cWhy go through this life,\u201d he asked, \u201cand not have the experience of having my own child?\u201d It\u2019s a question many childless people over 50 are asking themselves. Of course, dealing with night feedings and rambunctious    are not for the faint of heart. But with their finances in order and their careers in place, with their life spans extended, some older people are concluding: Why not start  \u2014   or continue  \u2014   raising children in later life? Stories of   parenthood often make headlines. This year, the    philanthropist and investor Nicolas Berggruen had two children via surrogate. Margarita   the chairwoman of the global trading house Louis Dreyfus Commodities, gave birth to twin girls at age 53. Janet Jackson made headlines when she announced her pregnancy two weeks before her 50th birthday. Luciano Pavarotti had a child after he was 65 Rupert Murdoch did so when he was over 70. Older men have long had children with younger wives, of course. And giving birth after age 50 is still extremely rare (only 743 American women ages 50 to 54 gave birth in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Vital Statistics Report.) Most important, despite a host of health and ethical issues raised by late parenthood, the whole idea is becoming more culturally accepted, particularly in certain highly affluent circles. \u201cMore women and men who are 50 or over are pushing the envelope and taking the leap into parenthood,\u201d said Rachel Lehmann Haupt, the author of \u201cIn Her Own Sweet Time: Egg Freezing and the New Frontiers of Family\u201d (Nothing but the Truth, 2016). \u201cWe\u2019re living longer, and this new middle age is becoming a time when people start to think about what they want to do with the rest of their lives. For many who haven\u2019t had kids, they decide to reinvent themselves as parents. \u201d The path to parenthood comes in many ways. Beyond adoption and surrogacy, some choose   fertilization, either with donor eggs or eggs they have frozen in the past. None of this is cheap. Mr. Campanella, for example, paid about $120, 000, which included legal and medical fees, and costs for the surrogate mother. \u201cPeople are so much healthier today,\u201d said Dr. Philip Chenette, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco. \u201cI see    routinely mountain biking in Marin County, and if you keep a good diet and keep your weight down, you can do a lot of things with your body that you couldn\u2019t do before. If your life expectancy is longer, why wouldn\u2019t you want to fill that time with your kid?\u201d Some fertility clinics have extended the age of the patients they will accept. The cutoff at Pacific Reproductive is 55 for women (The combined age for a couple is 110). There is none at the New York Fertility Institute, in Manhattan. \u201cWe\u2019ve had patient\u2019s first baby delivered to 57,\u201d said Dr. Majid Fateh, the founder and medical director. Steve Klein, a family formation lawyer in San Diego, is also seeing older people coming through his doors. \u201cAs surrogacy has become more mainstream, people see it as a viable way to have a child, especially for people who are beyond the optimum reproductive ages,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have money, they can provide a comfortable life, a private education. They can have nannies assist them, or one of them could be a    parent, and they\u2019re older and wiser and more mature. They can be a better parent than if they were younger. \u201d Sometimes no one is more surprised by the desire to have a child in later life than the    . Merle Hoffman, the founder and chief executive of Choices Women\u2019s Medical Center, in Queens, said she had never wanted children. \u201cI saw myself leading troops into battle,\u201d said Ms. Hoffman, now 70. \u201cThat didn\u2019t allow for a maternal kind of orientation. \u201d She was so clear on her decision that she terminated a pregnancy at age 32. But when she was in her mid 50s, her husband of more than two decades died. The emptiness was palpable. \u201cI had experienced many facets of love: sexual, devotional, parental from myself to my mother, the love of a cause. But I had never experienced what so many people experience as being the ultimate nonconditional love,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to experience what it was to love like that. \u201d At 58, Ms. Hoffman adopted a     girl from Russia. Friends greeted her with everything from shock to rage. \u201cSome were like, \u2018What are you, nuts? You\u2019re too old! \u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cSome were supportive. Others were thinking, \u2018Well, where\u2019s my position in her life going to be now? Because this child will be the most important person. \u2019\u201d While some people worry about the daily logistics of having a child later in life, others worry about the ethics of it. Annie Worshoufsky MacAulay, 55, a nurse in Hartford, is planning to adopt a baby with her partner, Cindy. The couple has a    son, Nate. Ms. MacAulay has four adult children from a previous marriage. Although she feels strong and vibrant, she does have some reservations. \u201cMy mind tells me  \u2014   oh, my God, am I going to be going to his graduation on a wheelchair? Will I be around? Will people think I\u2019m his grandma? My mind and body have a constant struggle. \u201d Doctors and lawyers also grapple with the ethical considerations of having a    child. In 2013, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine revised its ethics committee report on oocyte or embryo donation to women of \u201cadvanced\u201d age. \u201cIn view of the lack of data about maternal and fetal safety,\u201d they concluded, \u201cproviding donor oocytes or embryos for transfer to any woman over 55 years of age, even when she has no underlying medical problems, should be discouraged. \u201d The risk of complications increases dramatically after 55, including   diabetes and high blood pressure. There are health risks from older fatherhood, too. Sperm from an older man, researchers say, puts children at an increased risk for autism, schizophrenia and dwarfism. While no one has yet advised men to freeze their sperm to save for a later date, \u201cit\u2019s not a terrible idea,\u201d said Dr. Chenette. Apart from the ethical considerations, there are practical issues to take into account. \u201cSome lawyers will say, \u2018Morally, is that really in the best interest to the child to be doing this? \u2019\u201d said Mr. Klein, who also runs a surrogacy center. \u201cI say, \u2018Do you have estate plans? Do you have people willing to step in as guardians? Do you have a support system in place for this child?\u2019 A responsible lawyer will insist on this with their clients. \u201d (Mr. Campanella appointed friends to be his son\u2019s guardian). For all the questions, advocates for older parents say they can provide something special for their children  \u2014   and themselves. \u201cMy father was 50 years older than me,\u201d said Dr. Fateh. \u201cI was in my 20s when he died, but the few years I spent with him were the best in my life. He was loving, understanding  \u2014   he was mature, he\u2019d gone through life. \u201d In his observations, Dr. Fateh added, \u201colder parents are really gentle with the kids and more understanding. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in a state of life where financially they\u2019re more comfortable,\u201d he added. \u201cThey spend a lot of time with the kids. In your 30s, you\u2019re working so hard you hardly see the kid. I don\u2019t know a single old father who regrets it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561940.1700726}
