On Saturday night in Rio, she freely discussed having her period while competing in the Olympics, breaking what has long been a taboo among female athletes. The video of her poolside interview quickly went viral. Ms. Fu\u2019s remarks came after the Chinese women\u2019s swimming team narrowly missed winning a medal in the   medley relay. In a   interview, Ms. Fu, who had already won a bronze medal for the   backstroke, could be seen crouching as her teammates were questioned one by one. As the commentator turned to her, Ms. Fu stood up, grimacing in pain. The commentator ventured a guess that Ms. Fu must be suffering from a stomachache, which Ms. Fu quickly corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s because I just got my period yesterday, so I\u2019m still a bit weak and really tired,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t an excuse for not swimming well. \u201d Ms. Fu\u2019s candor immediately attracted a deluge of comments online. On Weibo, China\u2019s   social media platform, the hashtag related to the subject was searched more than half a million times by the end of Sunday, with many commenters expressing their support for Ms. Fu\u2019s openness. \u201cOnly those who have gotten their periods know how deathly painful it can be,\u201d one wrote. \u201cYou are too awesome. \u201d A male user wrote, \u201cTo compete during her period and still feel bad about placing fourth: Fu Yuanhui, you are amazing. You are our pride. \u201d Female commenters also took to social media to dispute largely   criticism that swimming in a pool while menstruating was unhealthy and unhygienic. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about staining the pool red or taking medicine to stop one\u2019s period,\u201d a female commenter wrote. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of something called a tampon?\u201d In many parts of the world, menstruation is still regarded with shame and distaste, though that is changing. In the United States, creative hashtag campaigns on social media and online petitions have challenged the discomfort about   topics. Female athletes, including the former tennis star Annabel Croft of Britain, have criticized the silence surrounding menstruation in sports. In 2015, the American musician Kiran Gandhi ran the London Marathon during her period sans female hygiene products to protest   crossing the finish line with bloodstains prominently on display. Yet more open discussion about menstruation has been more slow to catch on in China. When talking about their periods, if at all, women still prefer to use euphemisms like \u201ca visit from my aunt\u201d or \u201ctaking a break. \u201d Television ads for feminine hygiene products are banned during prime viewing times as inappropriate. As a result, very few Chinese women use tampons, because it is widely, and falsely, believed that they can rob a woman of her virginity. This month, Chinese entrepreneurs plan to introduce the country\u2019s first domestic tampon brand. All tampons sold in China have been imported, and most are sold online. In February, Anhui Province issued regulations allowing women to take up to two days off for menstrual pain, provided they could procure a doctor\u2019s note certifying their symptoms. However, critics feared the practice might have the unintended effect of discouraging employers from hiring women and pointed out that women might still elect to forgo a paid menstrual leave to avoid criticism from male colleagues. \u201cFu Yuanhui\u2019s comments have raised awareness, because Chinese society still approaches menstruation indirectly, even considering it unlucky,\u201d said Chen Yaya, a feminist activist and researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. \u201cBut there\u2019s no need for this at all. The period is simply an everyday phenomenon. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564425.5120878}
