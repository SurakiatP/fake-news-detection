But protests on campus over cultural and racial sensitivities last year soured his feelings. Now Mr. MacConnell, who graduated in 1960, is expressing his discontent through his wallet. In June, he cut the college out of his will. \u201cAs an alumnus of the college, I feel that I have been lied to, patronized and basically dismissed as an old, white bigot who is insensitive to the needs and feelings of the current college community,\u201d Mr. MacConnell, 77, wrote in a letter to the college\u2019s alumni fund in December, when he first warned that he was reducing his support to the college to a token $5. A backlash from alumni is an unexpected aftershock of the campus disruptions of the last academic year. Although   are still gauging the extent of the effect on philanthropy, some colleges  \u2014   particularly small, elite liberal arts institutions  \u2014   have reported a decline in donations, accompanied by a laundry list of complaints. Alumni from a range of generations say they are baffled by today\u2019s college culture. Among their laments: Students are too wrapped up in racial and identity politics. They are allowed to take too many frivolous courses. They have repudiated the heroes and traditions of the past by judging them by today\u2019s standards rather than in the context of their times. Fraternities are being unfairly maligned, and men are being demonized by sexual assault investigations. And university administrations have been too meek in addressing protesters whose messages have seemed to fly in the face of free speech. Scott C. Johnston, who graduated from Yale in 1982, said he was on campus last fall when activists tried to shut down a free speech conference, \u201cbecause apparently they missed irony class that day. \u201d He recalled the Yale student who was videotaped screaming at a professor, Nicholas Christakis, that he had failed \u201cto create a place of comfort and home\u201d for students in his capacity as the head of a residential college. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything has damaged Yale\u2019s brand quite like that,\u201d said Mr. Johnston, a founder of an internet   and a former hedge fund manager. \u201cThis is not your daddy\u2019s liberalism. \u201d \u201cThe worst part,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that campus administrators are wilting before the activists like flowers. \u201d Yale College\u2019s alumni fund was flat between this year and last, according to Karen Peart, a university spokeswoman. Among about 35 small, selective liberal arts colleges belonging to the   organization Staff, or Sharing the Annual Fund Fundamentals, that recently reported their initial annual fund results for the 2016 fiscal year, 29 percent were behind 2015 in dollars, and 64 percent were behind in donors, according to a steering committee member, Scott Kleinheksel of Claremont McKenna College in California. His school, which was also the site of protests, had a decline in donor participation but a rise in giving. At Amherst, the amount of money given by alumni dropped 6. 5 percent for the fiscal year that ended June 30, and participation in the alumni fund dropped 1. 9 percentage points, to 50. 6 percent, the lowest participation rate since 1975, when the college began admitting women, according to the college. The amount raised from big donors decreased significantly. Some of the decline was because of a falloff after two large reunion gifts last year, according to Pete Mackey, a spokesman for Amherst. At Princeton, where protesters unsuccessfully demanded the removal of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s name from university buildings and programs, undergraduate alumni donations dropped 6. 6 percent from a record high the year before, and participation dropped 1. 9 percentage points, according to the university\u2019s website. A Princeton spokesman, John Cramer, said there was no evidence the drop was connected to campus protests. Carolyn A. Martin, Amherst\u2019s president, said she was not surprised that student protests had contributed to the decline in  . \u201cI think colleges are places where complicated societywide issues are always thrashed out, sometimes across generations,\u201d Dr. Martin, known as Biddy, said in an interview. Dr. Martin defended Amherst as a place where free speech and high standards still held sway, and said she had pushed back against protesters when necessary. Much of the alumni unrest at Amherst crystallized around the college\u2019s decision to renounce its unofficial mascot, Lord Jeffery Amherst, known as Lord Jeff, an   British commander in the French and Indian War who gave his name to the town and, by extension, the college. A new generation of students has criticized his attitude toward Native Americans he endorsed the idea of spreading smallpox among enemy tribes by giving them infected blankets. \u201cHe hated the Indians, because any general in his position would have,\u201d said Gordon Hall III, class of \u201952, a commercial real estate investor. He and Don MacNaughton, class of \u201965, a retired lawyer and a history buff, wrote a booklet concluding that Lord Jeff had been unfairly maligned. Mr. MacNaughton paid for his share of its publication and promotion online with thousands of dollars he would have otherwise given to the college. \u201cI feel that money is going to the benefit of Amherst College, in any event,\u201d Mr. MacNaughton said. The older generation remembers Lord Amherst not as a genocidal warmonger, but as the inspiration for a beloved college fight song, written by a member of the class of 1906. The song, which Mr. Hall, 86, can still sing by heart, winks knowingly at Lord Amherst\u2019s misdeeds with the line, \u201cTo the Frenchman and the Indians, he didn\u2019t do a thing. \u201d Mr. Hall, whose grandfather, father, uncles and son went to Amherst, archly calls himself \u201ca powerhouse of nepotism. \u201d But he has endowed a scholarship and says he welcomes students whose backgrounds are different from his. \u201cI get letters every year about the recipient of my scholarship fund,\u201d he said. \u201cThe name will always be a name that is ethnically or racially  \u2014   you can tell  \u2014   not like Hall. And so be it. You\u2019ve got to go with the flow to some degree. \u201d But, he wonders, \u201cwhere did this supercorrectness thing come from?\u201d In the category of supercorrectness, some alumni note that in March, a new director of the Women\u2019s and Gender Center asked to be addressed as \u201cthey,\u201d rather than \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe. \u201d \u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d Paul Ruxin, who identified himself as \u201cOld Curmudgeon class of \u201965,\u201d wrote to his classmates shortly before he died in April. David Pennock, class of \u201960, one of four generations of his family to have gone to Amherst, is so invested in the college that he bridles at incorrect pronunciations of the name. \u201cOur Amherst is pronounced without the H,\u201d he said. His Amherst was tough but paternalistic, he said. When he fell behind in classes, the admissions dean, Eugene Wilson, class of \u201929 and his father\u2019s fraternity roommate, took him trout fishing on the Deerfield River and warned that he was headed for the \u201cunderachiever program,\u201d a forced leave of absence. As class agent, Mr. Pennock did not reduce his giving, but he is one of a group of alumni pushing for the return of a core curriculum. Robert Longsworth, class of \u201999, the seventh in his family to have attended Amherst, has been the president of the New York City alumni association and a class agent. But he has withdrawn, he said, because of his sense that the college has become \u201cso wrapped up in this politically charged mission rather than staying in its lane and being an institution of higher education. \u201d Mr. Longsworth, 39, who works in the financial industry, said he thought erasing history only made people more vulnerable to racism. \u201cWhen the administration and faculty and ultimately a lot of the student body spends a great deal of time on witch hunts, I think that a lot of that intellectual rigor is forgone,\u201d he said. Mr. Longsworth said he had heard from \u201cfriends who went to Hamilton, Trinity, Williams, Bates, Middlebury, Hobart, who are not pleased at what\u2019s happened on campus, and they\u2019ve kind of stepped away. \u201d For these alumni, he said, refusing to write a check \u201cseems to be the only lever that can make a difference. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562089.156439}
