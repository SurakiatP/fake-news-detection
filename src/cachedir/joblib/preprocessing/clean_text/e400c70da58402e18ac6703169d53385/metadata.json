Price said, \u201cI firmly believe that nobody will be worse off financially in the process that we\u2019re going through, understanding that they\u2019ll have choices that they can select the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their family, not that the government forces them to buy. So there\u2019s cost that needs to come down, and we believe we\u2019re going to be able to do that through this system. There\u2019s coverage that\u2019s going to go up. \u201d Price added, \u201cI believe, and the president believes firmly, that if you create a system that\u2019s accessible for everybody and you provide the financial feasibility for everybody to get coverage, that we have a great opportunity to increase coverage over where we are right now, as opposed to where the line is going right now where people are losing coverage and we\u2019re going to have fewer individuals covered than we do currently. \u201d (  Politico) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561641.0705152}
