But given the choice between taking Uncle Sam\u2019s freebies and continuing to offer thanks to God before serving meals, the mission\u2019s leaders decided on the latter. \\n\u201cWe can no longer take the food on principal [sic] because prayer is an integral part of everything we do at Bethesda Mission,\u201d Scott Dunwoody, the shelter\u2019s vice president of business development, told Harrisburg\u2019s WHTM-TV . \\n\u201cThe USDA revised regulations regarding this food distribution to say that no religious services or religious activities could occur during the distribution of the food,\u201d Wingate told CNSNews.com . \u201cWell, we pray before meals, so if there\u2019s a meal being served \u2014 and we serve 3,000 meals a week \u2014 if there\u2019s a meal being served with USDA food somewhere in it, then we would be prohibited from praying. We just said \u2018nope\u2019 that\u2019s too onerous for us and we\u2019re not going to continue to accept the food if that\u2019s a condition of receiving it.\u201d \\nMany religious charities are now faced with the same dilemma as Bethesda. So far, few seem willing to cut the umbilical cord to Washington \u2014 or perhaps they long ago made the necessary compromises to get USDA comestibles. Jennifer Powell of the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank told PennLive that \u201conly a handful\u201d of the bank\u2019s 900 program partners have chosen either to stop taking the USDA food or to change their practices \u2014 by, say, conducting prayers outside the room in which the food is served \u2014 to fall in line with the new rule. \\nEric Saunders, executive director of Harrisburg-area New Hope Ministries, told PennLive his ministry didn\u2019t need to change its practices because they have never required people to participate in prayer or a religious service in order to obtain food. \u201cWhen the new rule came out,\u201d reported the website, \u201cSaunders said he simply reminded staff to make sure any religious activities were done at a different time or place from when people were being served.\u201d \\nBethesda doesn\u2019t require participation in religious activities, either, but anyone there for a meal is going to be in the presence of an audible prayer. This, apparently, does not comport with the Obama administration\u2019s definition of religious freedom, whereby passively causing someone to hear a prayer before giving him free food is unacceptable but forcing a Christian charity or business to pay for contraceptive coverage for its employees is worth defending all the way to the Supreme Court. \\nSaunders said of Bethesda, \u201cI have a lot of respect for them and the principled stand they took.\u201d \\nBethesda will probably not be hurt much by declining the USDA\u2019s food. Although 1,000 pounds a month sounds like quite a bit of food, it really only amounted to about 0.5 percent of the food distributed by the shelter, according to Wingate. He claimed the announcement has already led to an increase in donations to the ministry. In addition, Powell said the food bank has plenty of other food the mission could use. \\nAll of these problems could have been avoided, of course, if the federal government had not strayed from its enumerated powers under the Constitution. Nowhere in that document is the government delegated the authority to distribute food, no matter how noble its intentions may be in doing so. As James Madison, the father of the Constitution, so eloquently put it, \u201cI cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents.\u201d \\nCharities, especially Christian ones, ought also to be mindful of the fact that the \u201cfree\u201d food they get from Washington and other levels of government is paid for by the expropriation of the citizenry; \u201cThou shalt not steal\u201d contains no exceptions for either government or charities. Furthermore, they should recognize that by accepting the government\u2019s largess, they are also accepting its control, even to the point of denying their faith. It may be more cumbersome and less reliable to subsist on voluntary contributions, but it is the only sure way to maintain a charity\u2019s religious character over the long run.
