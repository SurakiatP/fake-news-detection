He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he\u2019d like to, \u201cpunch him in the face.\u201d Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,\u201dComedian\u201d? \\nRobert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how \u201cdepressed\u201d the tycoon\u2019s win in the presidential election had made him. \\nThe 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film \u201cThe Comedian\u201d in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump\u2019s victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. \\n\u201cHow am I doing? I\u2019m very depressed,\u201d the famously laconic \u201cRaging Bull\u201d actor told reporters. \\n\u201cWe have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.\u201d \\nAsked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s election, he replied: \u201cYes, absolutely. Things aren\u2019t being done right.\u201d \\nDemonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday. \\nIn Manhattan, they held signs reading \u201cYour Wall Can\u2019t Stand in Our Way\u201d \u2014 a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico. \\nDe Niro hasn\u2019t minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as \u201ca punk,\u201d \u201ca pig\u201d and \u201can idiot.\u201d \\n\u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\u201d he said before the election. \\nEarlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro\u2019s grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape. \\n\u201cIf, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,\u201d said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano. \\n\u201cThe Comedian,\u201d De Niro\u2019s passion project which took him eight years to bring to the big screen, was part of this year\u2019s program for the American Film Institute\u2019s annual AFI Fest in Los Angeles. \u2013 Yahoo \\nHere\u2019s a clip of Trump-hater Megyn Kelly promoting DiNero\u2019s hateful rant against Donald J.
