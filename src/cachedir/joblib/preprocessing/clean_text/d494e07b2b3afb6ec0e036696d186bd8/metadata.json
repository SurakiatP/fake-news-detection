For nearly four decades, however, the Lakota Sioux have refused to accept payment and instead continued to demand that the United States return the territory. \\nToday, the Sioux people are continuing to take a stand on these principles \u2013 the flashpoint now being the Dakota Access Pipeline, which, upon its completion is expected to transport some 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across several states. Sioux tribe members and their allies have protested this pipeline for months, raising concerns about the threat it poses to their water supply, the effects that the fracked oil will have on the climate, and the process by which the project was approved, saying that it failed to take into account Native rights. \\n\u201cWe live with so many broken promises, there\u2019s no reason for it,\u201d said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. \u201cWe understand what lands we own, and what lands were illegally taken from us.\u201d \\nThe government, of course, is responding the way it always has to Native American resistance \u2013 through brute force. Over the past few months, police and private security forces have viciously suppressed the water protectors, siccing dogs on them and arresting them for \u201ctrespassing.\u201d The repression, which a group of United Nations experts called \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cincreasingly militarized,\u201d culminated Sunday night in some of worst violence against Native people seen since the 1973 siege of nearby Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. \\nPolice fired tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and water at hundreds of protesters in the subfreezing North Dakota weather late Sunday night and early Monday morning, following an attempt by protesters to remove burned vehicles blocking Backwater Bridge in order to enable emergency vehicles and local traffic to move freely. \\nThe police assault led to several reported cases of life-threatening hypothermia. \u201cIt is below freezing right now and the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department is using a water cannon on our people \u2013 that is an excessive and potentially deadly use of force,\u201d said activist Dallas Goldtooth. \\nEvery aspect of this appears to violate the letter and spirit of the 1868 Laramie Treaty, in which the federal government not only promised to respect Sioux land rights, but also to come to the aid of Native people if they are wronged by outside forces. \\n\u201cIf bad men among the whites, or among other people subject to the authority of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon the person or property of the Indians, the United States will \u2026 proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States, and also re-imburse the injured person for the loss sustained,\u201d the treaty reads . \\nAt this time of Thanksgiving, it would only be appropriate for President Barack Obama to insist that the \u201cbad men\u201d who are committing wrongs \u201cupon the person or property of the Indians\u201d stand down immediately, as well as to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and reimburse the Sioux for losses already sustained. \\nThen, perhaps, the shameful tradition of breaking treaties while giving thanks might itself be broken, and Americans might be able to enjoy their turkey dinners and family reunions without a cloud of hypocrisy hanging over their heads.'"}, "time": 1742564560.6865652}
