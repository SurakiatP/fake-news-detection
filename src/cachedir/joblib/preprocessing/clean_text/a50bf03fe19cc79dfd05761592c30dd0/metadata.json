But it is not easy: Open a window or a door, and the haze enters the room within seconds. Outside, the sky is white, the sun a white circle so pale that you can barely make it out. The smog is acrid,   and   and so thick that it is being blamed for a   pileup north of the city. If in past years Delhi\u2019s roughly 20 million residents shrugged off wintertime pollution as fog, over the past week they viewed it as a crisis. Schools have been ordered closed for three days  \u2014   an unprecedented measure, but not a reassuring one because experts say the concentration of pollutants inside Indian homes is typically not much lower than outside. Levels of the most dangerous particles, called PM 2. 5, reached 700 micrograms per cubic meter on Monday, and over the weekend they soared in some places to 1, 000, or more than 16 times the limit India\u2019s government considers safe. The damage from sustained exposure to such high concentrations of PM 2. 5 is equivalent to smoking more than two packs of cigarettes a day, experts say. \u201cThere is so much smog outside that today, inside my house, I felt as though someone had just burned a few sheets of paper,\u201d said Amaan Ahuja, one of dozens who shared their families\u2019 experiences in response to a request from The New York Times. \u201cYou can literally see smoke in the air, and when you breathe, you can smell it, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to keep the kids indoors with all the windows closed. \u201d Another reader, Tulika Seth, described her family\u2019s life over the past week as \u201cunnatural and disturbing. \u201d Asked where she lived, she responded, \u201ca gas chamber. \u201d To understand the health consequences of the dense smog that settled over India\u2019s capital over the past week, scientists are looking back decades in search of a historical precedent: to the 1952 Great Smog of London, which is believed to have caused as many as 12, 000 premature deaths. In that case, a layer of dense pollution  \u2014   caused largely by emissions from burning coal  \u2014   dissipated after four days, when the weather changed. But an uptick in deaths continued for weeks afterward, so shocking the public that it spurred a wave of environmental regulations. Delhi\u2019s chief minister on Sunday announced a series of emergency measures, including a   moratorium on construction, a   closure of a power plant and a   closure of about 1, 800 public schools. On Monday, the city government released a list of health guidelines, advising citizens to wash their eyes with running water and to go to a hospital if they were experiencing symptoms like \u201cbreathlessness, giddiness, chest pain and chest constriction. \u201d But experts said mitigating the conditions would have required policies to be put in place months ago. \u201cThese are all decent emergency measures, but they\u2019re not solving the   problem,\u201d said Bhargav Krishna, who manages the Public Health Foundation of India\u2019s environmental health center. \u201cThe best we can hope for, in a way, is to plan for next year,\u201d he added. \u201cThis year is almost a washout. \u201d Changing weather conditions are likely to disperse the dense cloud of pollutants over the next few days. But they will also bring the beginning of the widespread burning of trash, including plastic and rubber, for warmth by Delhi\u2019s poor. Among the persistent problems for policy makers is that the sources of the pollution  \u2014   vehicles, construction, crop burning and holiday fireworks  \u2014   fall under the authority of half a dozen city, state and federal government bodies, which are in some cases at odds with one another politically, Mr. Krishna said. \u201cWhere exactly is the responsibility for implementing these plans?\u201d he said. \u201cAt whose desk does this all lie?\u201d He added, \u201cThe diffuse nature of power means that it is easy to pass on responsibility to others. \u201d Public anger over Delhi\u2019s air is more palpable than in previous years, and people are more likely to identify pollution as the cause of their health problems. Anumita Roychowdhury, who runs the air pollution program at the Center for Science and Environment, said that sense of urgency would have to be sustained if the city were to impose lifestyle changes, including restraints on car travel. \u201cThis has to translate to very strong support for very hard decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cAll soft options are over. \u201d First, though, people here must get through the next few days. Sherebanu Frosh, who lives in Gurgaon, south of Delhi, said she and her children were \u201ccowering by our air purifiers,\u201d which had become overloaded with the concentration of particles in the air. \u201cSo we\u2019re putting both our purifiers in one room and spending the day there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we leave, we wear masks. \u201d Jessica Farmer, whose children attend the American Embassy School in Delhi, said she had moved five purifiers into three rooms of her house, but the concentration of PM 2. 5 in some places remained at 300, five times the W. H. O. recommended limit. \u201cIt is as though we are under siege,\u201d Ms. Farmer said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go outside, to malls or movies where the air is not purified. \u201cHow can one live like this?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628441.011597}
