[The film, starring the late John Hurt, will be screened on April 4, the date in the book in which Smith begins his rebellion against Big Brother, the   eye of the fascist regime.  The 1949 novel follows the struggles of Winston Smith, a man living in a totalitarian police state, and has become culturally iconic as a symbol of fascist regimes. Leading independent cinemas including the Alamo Drafthouse, IFC Center, and Film Society of Lincoln Center have all signed up to host screenings, according to the Independent. Although the theater protests form part of a wider opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, the group behind the effort says its goal is to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s reported plans to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. \u201cThe endeavor encourages theaters to take a stand for our most basic values: freedom of speech, respect for our fellow human beings, and the simple truth that there are no such things as \u2018alternative facts\u2019.

Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, Amazon revealed that sales of the book 1984 have risen significantly.
