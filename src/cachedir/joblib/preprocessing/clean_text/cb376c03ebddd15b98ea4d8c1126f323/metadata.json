B. I. said it was investigating as a \u201cpotential act of terrorism. \u201d Nine people were injured in the attack before an   police officer fatally shot the   man, the authorities in St. Cloud said. The attacker, who was dressed in a security guard uniform, mentioned Allah and asked at least one victim if he was Muslim, the police said. All nine victims were expected to survive. The Islamic State on Sunday claimed responsibility for the episode, but it was unclear whether the attacker, whom the police have not identified, was in fact acting in the name of the terror group. The Amaq News Agency, which acts as the Islamic State\u2019s newswire, released a bulletin saying the \u201cexecutor of the stabbing attacks in #Minnesota yesterday was a soldier of the Islamic State. \u201d The terror group\u2019s bulletin went on to say the attack was a response to the group\u2019s call to \u201ctarget citizens of countries belonging to the crusader coalition,\u201d a term referring to the United   coalition carrying out airstrikes against the group. The language of the bulletin  \u2014   down to the reference to the perpetrator as a soldier of the Islamic State  \u2014   mirrors claims of responsibility the group issued for numerous attacks in recent weeks. This summer, a spokesman for the Islamic State, Abu Muhammad   advised his followers overseas to carry out jihad at home. He said that it was no longer necessary to join the group in Iraq and Syria, and that aspiring jihadists should instead use whatever means they had to kill. Chief William Blair Anderson of the St. Cloud police told reporters at the scene, \u201cIt has hit home for us,\u201d adding, \u201cBut I want everybody in St. Cloud to know that we will be diligent and we will get to the bottom of this. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an awful day, honestly,\u201d Chief Anderson said. In a phone interview on Sunday morning, Mayor Dave Kleis said the mall, Crossroads Center, was an active crime scene and would remain closed. He praised the   police officer, who he said had \u201cclearly saved lives and protected the other individuals. \u201d \u201cThis is exactly what keeps me up at night, and last night it did,\u201d Mr. Kleis said. \u201cThis could happen in any community in this country, and certainly we have seen it happen. Certainly it is something that really scares a community. \u201d Later Sunday, Mr. Kleis identified the   officer as Jason Falconer, a police officer in nearby Avon, Minn. Mr. Kleis said video footage of the shooting, which has not been released publicly, showed Officer Falconer confronting the attacker in a Macy\u2019s store and shooting him as he charged with a knife. \u201cFor me watching it, it looked like a training video for what law enforcement should do,\u201d Mr. Kleis said. The mayor said the wounded included seven men, one woman and a teenage girl, all from the St. Cloud area. Mr. Kleis called the attack an \u201cevil act, unjustifiable in any way. \u201d The disruption to a carefree night of shopping in central Minnesota occurred on the same day that 29 people in New York City were injured in an explosion and that an explosive device detonated near the route of a race in New Jersey. The authorities on Sunday night were becoming convinced that the New York and New Jersey episodes were connected, but have given no indication of a link to the stabbing in St. Cloud. Chief Anderson said officers had searched two local residences on Sunday in connection with the case. He said the police had had at least three prior interactions with the attacker, mostly for minor traffic violations. Richard Thornton, the special agent in charge for the F. B. I. in Minneapolis, said the agency was treating it as a potential terrorist act but was still investigating. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. \u201cWe do not at this point in time know whether the subject was in contact with, had connections with, was inspired by a foreign terrorist organization. \u201d Chief Anderson said the attack had started around 8 p. m. and played out at different sites within Crossroads Center, including multiple businesses and common areas. Mr. Kleis, who went to Crossroads Center after the attack, said that \u201cthere were a lot of people in that mall and clearly a lot of witnesses,\u201d and that police interviews had stretched well into Sunday morning. Witnesses and local journalists spoke of a busy, crowded and confusing scene after the attack, as well as a swift police mobilization. \u201cOne guy was bleeding from the side of his face,\u201d Sydney Weires, a college student who was inside the mall, told The St. Cloud Times. \u201cHe was screaming at us\u201d to get out. Harley Exsted, another mall patron, told The St. Cloud Times, \u201cAll of a sudden I heard pop pop pop. \u201d \u201cI thought someone tipped over a shelf,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden these people started running. I just saw everybody running our way. \u201d St. Cloud, a city of about 67, 000 residents, is about an hour\u2019s drive northwest of Minneapolis. \u201cStarting tomorrow,\u201d Chief Anderson said after the attack, \u201cthings won\u2019t be the same here. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563672.7346218}
