McCabe (@NeilWMcCabe) January 20, 2017,  10:09 PM: AP reports: 10 Promises Trump Made for His First Day, WASHINGTON (AP)  \u2014   Behind in the polls in late October, Donald Trump ventured to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to give American voters a \u201ccontract\u201d detailing what he would achieve during his first day in office. Beneath a list of 18 major actions was the flourish of Trump\u2019s familiar signature and a blank space for voters to sign. But as Trump becomes president on Friday, it remains hazy as to which actions he will immediately take. The list included several items likely to fire up Republican voters but backed up by scant policy. It includes \u201cbegin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants\u201d and \u201ccancel every unconstitutional executive action   \u2026     by President Obama. \u201d Trump has already backed down from one pledge to label China a currency manipulator, recently saying he would first like to speak with the Chinese leadership. A look at 10 of the key promises Trump made for his first day as president:  \u2014  Introduce a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits.  \u2014  Freeze hiring for the federal government to reduce payrolls, although the military, public safety and public health agencies would be exempt.  \u2014  Ban White House and congressional officials from becoming lobbyists for five years after they leave the government.  \u2014  Announce plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico or withdraw from the deal.  \u2014  Formally withdraw from the   Partnership.  \u2014  Lift restrictions on mining coal and drilling for oil and natural gas.  \u2014  Remove any   roadblocks to energy projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline.  \u2014  Cancel U. S. payments to U. N. climate change programs and redirect the money to U. S. water and environmental infrastructure.  \u2014  Stop all federal funding to \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d places where local officials don\u2019t arrest or detain immigrants living in the country illegally for federal authorities.  \u2014  Suspend immigration from regions associated with terrorism where vetting is difficult. 9:58 PM: Breitbart News\u2019 Ian Hanchett reports: During a live report on Thursday\u2019s \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d on the Fox News Channel, a young man protesting in Washington, DC claimed to have started a fire in the street, \u201cBecause I felt like it.

C. on the eve of his inauguration. He told a cheering crowd that in 2018 Republicans are going to win more seats in the Senate. Breitbart\u2019s Neil Munro reports: \u201cWe have an election coming up in two years,\u201d Trump told the crowd after thanking his early and his late donors. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a lot of them elected  \u2026     [GOP Sen.] Mitch McConnell is here, he\u2019s smiling so big,\u201d Trump joked. McConnell is the GOP leader of the Senate. In 2018, he will have the opportunity to push his narrow 52 to 48 majority up to dominant 58 or even 60 seats. If the GOP reaches 60 Senate seats, then McConnell will usually be able to break the Democrats\u2019s \u201cfilibuster\u201d ability to block legislation. Forty Senators are needed to maintain a filibuster.   Senate Democrats face   in November 2018, while only eight Republicans must face the voters. Among the Democrats, nine Senators are either freshmen or won less than 53 percent in their prior election, and four will face the voters in states won by Trump. Several balls and dinners are taking place around town tonight amid protests.

Thank you very much everybody, and thank you Tom. I\u2019d like to congratulate our incredible entertainers tonight. Toby, and Lee Greenwood and all of the great talent. It was really very special. I also have to thank our incredible military right here. Thank you. Stand up, please. You guys were really great. Thank you. So this journey began 18 months ago. I had something to do with it, but you had much more to do with it than I did. I\u2019m the messenger. I\u2019m just the messenger. And we were tired. And I love you. Believe me, I love you. We all got tired of seeing what was happening. And we wanted change, but we wanted real change. And I look so forward to tomorrow. We\u2019re going to see something that is going to be so amazing. So many people have poured into Washington, D. C. This started out tonight being a small little concert, and then we had the idea maybe we\u2019ll do it in front of the Lincoln Memorial. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ever been done before. But if it has, very seldom. And the people came by the thousands and thousands, and here we are tonight, all the way back. All the way back. So it\u2019s a movement that began, it\u2019s a movement that started, and it\u2019s a movement like we\u2019ve never seen anywhere in the world, they say. There\u2019s never been a movement like this and it\u2019s something very, very special. And we\u2019re going to unify our country, and our phrase  \u2014   you all know it, half of you are wearing the hat  \u2014   \u201cMake America Great Again. \u201d But we\u2019re going to make America great for all of our people, everybody. Everybody throughout our country. That includes the inner cities, that includes everybody.  And we\u2019re going to do a special job, and I can only tell you that 18 months ago, we never knew, a lot of people didn\u2019t know, some people had a feeling. A lot of people didn\u2019t give us much of a chance, but we understood what was happening. And that last month of the campaign, when I traveled around to every place that you can imagine. State after state after state, speech after speech. And we had ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand people. There was never an empty seat, just like tonight. We didn\u2019t know if anybody would even come tonight. This hasn\u2019t been done before. And you look. It was the same way. And we all knew that last month of the campaign. I think a lot of us knew the first week of the campaign, but that last month of the campaign we knew that something special was happening.  And I can only tell you this: The polls started going up, up, up, but they didn\u2019t want to give us credit. Because they forgot about a lot of us. On the campaign I called it \u201cthe forgotten man\u201d and \u201cthe forgotten woman. \u201d Well, you\u2019re not forgotten anymore. That I can tell you. Not forgotten anymore. So I want to thank my great family, my incredible wife Melania. They\u2019ve been so supportive, and it wasn\u2019t easy for them. But they have been so supportive. I want to thank you, most importantly. And I promise you that I will work so hard. We\u2019re going to get it turned around. We\u2019re going to get our jobs back. We\u2019re not going to let other countries take our jobs any longer. We\u2019re going to build up our great military. We\u2019re going to build it up. We\u2019re going to strengthen our borders. We\u2019re going to do things that haven\u2019t been done for our country for many, many decades. It\u2019s going to change. I promise you it\u2019s going to change. So I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. And I don\u2019t care frankly if it\u2019s going to be beautiful or if it\u2019s going to rain like crazy. Makes no difference to me. I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be beautiful. But I will see you tomorrow, and I\u2019m going to be cheering you on. You\u2019re going to cheer me on, but I\u2019m going to be cheering you on. Because what we\u2019ve done is so special. All over the world they\u2019re talking about it. All over the world. And I love you folks, and we\u2019re going to work together. And we are going to  \u2014   make America great again. And I\u2019ll add: Greater than ever before! Thank you very much and enjoy the fireworks. Thank you everybody. Thank you for joining us at the Lincoln Memorial   a very special evening!
