[\u201cIt remains for me the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my lifetime,\u201d Judd said of Trump\u2019s successful election. \u201cRaped as a child  \u2014   bad.   by a political system that ordains a clown  \u2014   really bad. \u201d  The Divergent star made the claim in a Huffington Post video titled, \u201cAshley Judd describes being triggered by Trump. \u201d Sporting a   \u201cPussy Hat\u201d popularized by feminist activists, Judd said the same male family member who failed to protect her from being sexually assaulted as a child betrayed her again by voting for Trump.  \u201cAnd the fact that there were adult men in my family  \u2014   who failed to protect me as a child  \u2014   voted for him, was really   in saying, \u2018You\u2019re gonna put me out there again. And the idea that you would protect me has evaporated.\u2019 And it was incredibly painful. Incredibly painful,\u201d she said. \u201cImmediately I began to weep, because it\u2019s not ok. It\u2019s not ok,\u201d Judd added. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not about the wall, it not about any of that stuff. It\u2019s about, you voted for a pussy grabber. You voted for someone who calls his wife a piece of ass, whose daughter is his favorite sex symbol. It really boils down to me to the sexual assault and the misogyny piece. \u201d Last month, at the Women\u2019s March in Washington, DC, Judd bashed Trump by suggesting that he has sexual fantasies about his daughter, Ivanka Trump.  \u201cI am not as nasty as your own daughter being your favorite sex symbol, like your wet dreams infused with your own genes,\u201d Judd said.
