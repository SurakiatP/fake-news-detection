[Venezuelans around the world also congregated in cities with large diaspora populations to demand an end to dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime. In Miami, celebrations of Cuban Independence Day on Saturday merged with Venezuelan exile protests against Maduro.  Protesters in Caracas  \u2014   participating in a march the opposition called \u201cWe are Millions\u201d  \u2014   demanded elections on Saturday, as well as an end to the military violence against unarmed protesters that has left 47 dead since protests began in late March. The protest spanned from the main Francisco Fajardo highway to the Ministry of the Interior in the capital. Francisco Fajardo has been home to some of the most violent clashes between protesters and the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) which Maduro has permitted to use tear gas, rubber bullets, and armored tanks to killed protesters. The highway has also been the scene of two of the most iconic images of the protests so far: an elder woman defying an armored tank and a nude young man climbing a tank holding a Bible, demanding an end to violence. \u201cI am still here despite all this,\u201d Leonard Quintero, a stylist, told   Presse. \u201cNo fear, because we have to support and defeat this with resistance. \u201d Police attacked protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets yet again. The most violent incident in Caracas on Saturday, however, was a panicked attack on an individual the crowd accused of being a thief and Chavista, who protesters doused in gasoline and set on fire. The man has been identified as Orlando Figuera, 21. (Warning: Graphic Images) In addition to violence from the military, protesters often have to contend with attacks from Chavista gangs known as colectivos, who beat and shoot unarmed protesters as an intimidation measure. In T\u00e1chira, a Colombian border state that has borne the brunt of much of Maduro\u2019s   violence, multiple reports estimate that over 40, 000 Venezuelans took the streets of the capital, the college town San Crist\u00f3bal, to demand an end to the Maduro era. T\u00e1chira was among the first states to rebel against Chavismo, beheading a statue of Ch\u00e1vez during the 2014 wave of protests. The mayor of San Crist\u00f3bal, Daniel Ceballos, was arrested by secret police (Sebin) in 2014 for supporting the   protests. Ceballos was sentenced to 12 months in prison in 2014, but remains detained in what his mother has condemned as deplorable conditions. Maduro recently deployed 2, 600 troops to the region in response to peaceful protests. A esta hora, los valientes de Coloncito, T\u00e1chira, recorren sus calles en procesi\u00f3n.

The Venezuelan newspaper El Universal estimated the Miami congregation to be about 2, 000 people strong. At press time Monday, hundreds had congregated throughout Venezuela for Day 52 of protests. These assemblies appeared focused on demanding that the socialist government reform their economic policies and allow the distribution of humanitarian aid, particularly medicine and food. Venezuela\u2019s Pharmaceutical Federation (Fefarven) estimates the nation is lacking 85 percent of medications on the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s list of drugs required to run a functional health care system. Hospitals and pharmacies have faced shortages of staples like ibuprofen, birth control, and cancer drugs for years. #22Mayo Sin miedo #Lara sale a la calle este lunes, nuestra lucha no se detiene.
