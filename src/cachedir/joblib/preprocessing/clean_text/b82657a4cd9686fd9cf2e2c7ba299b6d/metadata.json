Trump would deliver a compassionate and measured speech about immigration on Wednesday, and prepared to lavish praise on the candidate on the party\u2019s Twitter account. So when Mr. Trump instead offered a fiery denunciation of migrant criminals and suggested deporting Hillary Clinton, Reince Priebus, the party chairman, signaled that aides should scrap the plan, and the committee made no statement at all. The evening tore a painful new wound in Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the Republican National Committee, imperiling his most important remaining political alliance. Mr. Priebus and his organization have been steadfastly supportive of Mr. Trump, defending him in public and spending millions of dollars to aid him. But the collaboration between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Mr. Priebus\u2019s committee has grown strained over the last month, according to six senior Republicans with detailed knowledge of both groups, some of whom asked to speak anonymously for fear of exacerbating tensions. There is no prospect of a full public breach between the Trump campaign and the R. N. C. because both sides rely on a joint   arrangement crucial to their election efforts. But tensions have grown to such a point that they threaten to diminish the party\u2019s ability to work smoothly with Mr. Trump during the most critical   Day phase of the race, when the committee traditionally helps supervise an extensive voter turnout effort. Mr. Trump, who has struggled to raise money, is dependent on his party\u2019s national committee to perform many of the basic functions of a presidential campaign. Should the partnership continue to deteriorate, it could hinder Mr. Trump\u2019s bid for a late comeback in the race. Mr. Priebus said in a statement that there was no significant friction between his committee and the Trump campaign, describing theirs as a \u201cfantastic working relationship. \u201d \u201cAny insinuation to the contrary is purely overblown gossip,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. And Jason Miller, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokesman, said: \u201cCooperation between the Trump campaign and the R. N. C. has never been better  \u2014   we are fully integrated. Everybody knows what has to be done to elect Mr. Trump and stop Hillary Clinton. \u201d But senior advisers to Mr. Priebus and Mr. Trump have collided over the turbulence in the campaign, the senior Republicans said. Mr. Trump\u2019s top policy adviser questioned Mr. Priebus\u2019s competence in a caustic email this week after the Phoenix speech. And Mr. Trump\u2019s    Jared Kushner, and Mr. Priebus\u2019s chief of staff clashed in a tense meeting over the use of the committee\u2019s war chest. Within Mr. Trump\u2019s circle, there is impatience with what advisers view as a cautious and conventional party bureaucracy,   to accommodate Mr. Trump\u2019s improvisational style. At times, Trump aides have vented that frustration in language that was contemptuous of Mr. Priebus, a genial Wisconsin lawyer who has been chairman for five years. When Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration speech this week spurred resignations from the National Hispanic Advisory Council for Trump, a   group, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers lashed out at Mr. Priebus in an email to the campaign staff. \u201cThe RNC needs to take control of this situation and quickly,\u201d wrote Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump\u2019s senior policy adviser, who often travels with the candidate. Describing the Hispanic Republicans who resigned in dismay as \u201cprofessional amnesty lobbyists,\u201d Mr. Miller asked, \u201cCan Reince do his job?\u201d Inside the committee, top officials have lost confidence in Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to right his listing campaign, according to the senior Republicans. Complaints abound about the haphazard nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s operation, in which power is so divided among strategists and members of the Trump family that the process of making even simple decisions is laborious and unpredictable. Mr. Trump is on his third campaign leadership team, having dismissed two previous chief advisers, and he has already fired two senior staff members, Rick Wiley and Ed Brookover, whose jobs included coordinating his strategy with the R. N. C. Mr. Priebus, who has a warm relationship with Mr. Trump and speaks with him daily, has also confided to some Republicans that he has been disappointed by Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to evolve as a candidate in the general election. He denied in a statement that he had complained about Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to shift course. \u201cI\u2019ve said exactly the opposite,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. \u201cI think he\u2019s had his best three weeks. \u201d Robin Hayes, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, said he was optimistic about the emerging relationship between his organization and the Trump campaign in his own state. But Mr. Hayes said it was widely understood within the national committee that Mr. Trump needed to make adjustments. \u201cThere have been discussions, that we don\u2019t need to create, \u2018Cleanup on Aisle 3,\u2019 for ourselves,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. \u201cHe\u2019s still going to be Trump  \u2014   that\u2019s important  \u2014   but Trump in a way that fits into a general election. \u201d Throughout the campaign, Mr. Priebus and his committee have been broadly deferential to Mr. Trump, declining to criticize many of his most provocative remarks and quickly designating him as the party\u2019s presumptive nominee in May. For Mr. Trump, Mr. Priebus has appeared to be a patient and accommodating partner, eager to promote his campaign and willing to rebuke Republicans who have declined to support him. Recently, the committee has sent aides to work several days a week at Trump Tower to bolster collaboration with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. These include Sean Spicer, a close adviser to Mr. Priebus. But the conflict has continued. At a meeting in New York late last month, Mr. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, pointedly challenged Katie Walsh, the committee\u2019s chief of staff, over the party\u2019s spending plans. In a tone that several witnesses described as imperious and aggressive, Mr. Kushner suggested that the national committee might not be giving Mr. Trump all the support he was due. Ms. Walsh pushed back strongly, telling Mr. Kushner, who has no background in politics, that the committee\u2019s   and spending are disclosed in detail to the Federal Election Commission, according to the witnesses who were in the room and two people briefed by them afterward. Ms. Walsh told Mr. Kushner that the committee had a responsibility to take a broad view of its finances, mapping out a budget for the entire party and ensuring it could remain operational for the rest of the year, and could not solely focus on Mr. Trump\u2019s needs. Mike DuHaime, a former political director for the committee, said tensions with the campaign could be harmful to both sides in the general election. \u201cFor the field operation to be truly effective, the campaign, the R. N. C and   races need to be on the same page about goals and resource allocation,\u201d he said. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers, said he was confident that Mr. Priebus remained \u201con board\u201d with the Trump campaign. At the same time, he acknowledged that much of the institutional Republican Party remained unfriendly to Mr. Trump. \u201cThe R. N. C. is giving him a lot of support,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the united Republican Party behind him in the way that a more establishment candidate would. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564293.984719}
