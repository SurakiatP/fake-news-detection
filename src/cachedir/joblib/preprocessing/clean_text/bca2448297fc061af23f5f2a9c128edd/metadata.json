Bob Dold, who represents a heavily Democratic district in northeastern Illinois, is in danger of losing his House of Representatives seat to former Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider. This is the third time in three cycles the two politicians have faced off in the pendulum-like district \u2014 first Schneider unseated Dold in 2012, then Dold unseated Schneider in 2014. \\nThe NRCC went on to criticize the Democrat nominee for voting with his party 90 percent of the time and touted their candidate as \u201cone of the most bipartisan members of Congress.\u201d \\nIn the ad, a clip from March 2016 showed Dold take a swipe at Trump in an interview with the Clinton News Network: \u201cI think Donald Trump has disqualified himself.\u201d \\nCNN reported on Aug. 10, 2016: \\nOne of the first Republicans to oppose Trump, the Illinois representative told WLS May 6: \u201cI will not support Donald Trump,\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s comments about women, Muslims, Latinos and POWs. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a uniter, not a divider,\u201d he said. \\nSupporting: Will write in a candidate. \\nRepublicans like Dold are a big part of the reason why Trump has been so successful. The Republican Party has sold out this country and the American people who used to support them. \\nThe veil has been lifted and many Americans have woken up to the fact that establishment Republicans are in on the globalist agenda and are one in the same with the Democrats. They attempt to squabble over minor issues to make it seem as if there\u2019s a difference, but the reality is that they\u2019re all in on it. \\nThey\u2019re selling out our country, and many of the so-called principled Republicans truly want a Hillary Clinton presidency because they want her globalist agenda to succeed. \\nThe NRCC\u2019s praise for Dold and criticism of his opponent evidences the fact that they\u2019re in on it. They criticize the Democrat for siding with his party but praise Dold for being \u201cbipartisan,\u201d which might as well be Washington-ese for Republicans rolling over while Democrats fundamentally transform this country. \\nThis country is at a precipice. There are those who want to maintain national sovereignty and get back to what made America great, and there are those that want globalism and to eviscerate America as we know it. \\nSo to the NRCC: there is nothing \u201cprincipled\u201d about giving our country away, and many of us are on to your game.'"}, "time": 1742564057.9709637}
