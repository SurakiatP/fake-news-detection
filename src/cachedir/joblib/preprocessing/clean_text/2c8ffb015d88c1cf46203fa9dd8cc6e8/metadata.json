Speaking at a news conference, the mayor, the police chief and other officials offered few details about what led to the death Wednesday night of the teenager, Tyre King. They cautioned that the investigation, which will be presented to a grand jury, will not be quick. So far, they said, they do not know of any video recording of the shooting. \u201cAny loss of life is tragic, but the loss of a young person is particularly difficult,\u201d Mayor Andrew J. Ginther said. \u201cInvestigations take time, and I ask for everyone\u2019s patience during this difficult time. \u201d According to the police, officers responded to a report of an armed robbery in the Olde Towne East neighborhood in central Columbus, and saw three males who matched the suspects\u2019 descriptions. Two fled and officers chased them into an alley, where Tyre pulled what appeared to be a gun from his waistband, the police said, and an officer shot him multiple times. The officer was identified as Bryan Mason, a   veteran, who fatally shot a man in 2012. His superiors cleared him of any wrongdoing in that episode. He has been placed on administrative leave. Tyre\u2019s death is one in a long string of deaths of black people at the hands of the police in recent years that have drawn national attention, particularly when video is made public. They have prompted sharp debates about race and policing, intense criticism of the police and, in some cases, civil unrest. One of the most scrutinized cases, and one of the most similar to the one in Columbus, also took place in Ohio: the 2014 death of Tamir Rice, 12, who was playing with a pellet gun in a park in Cleveland. Columbus officials made it clear that they were acutely aware of that history, saying it was too early to make parallels to Tamir\u2019s case, and insisting that they were striving for openness and community outreach that critics have said were lacking in other cities. They also repeatedly stressed Tyre\u2019s conduct, the credible threats officers face and the gun culture. \u201cWhy is it that a    would have nearly an exact replica of a police firearm on him in our neighborhoods?\u201d Mr. Ginther asked. \u201cAn eighth grader involved in very, very dangerous conduct in one of our neighborhoods. \u201d The mayor cited \u201ceasy access to guns, whether they are firearms or replicas,\u201d as a serious problem, adding, \u201cA    is dead in the city of Columbus because of our obsession with guns. \u201d Kimberley Jacobs, the police chief, repeatedly referred to Tyre as a \u201cyoung man,\u201d and said: \u201cThis is the last thing that a police officer wants to do in their career. Unfortunately, because of the things that are happening out on the streets, it becomes necessary at times to defend themselves. \u201d She held up a photograph of a BB gun of the kind found in the alley near Tyre to show how similar it looks to the sidearm used by the Columbus police, a Smith  Wesson Military  Police semiautomatic pistol. The Columbus Police posted a similar image on Twitter. The photographs show a BB gun that does not have an orange tip or other bright colors sometimes used to distinguish them from lethal weapons. \u201cIt turns out not to be a firearm, in the sense that it fires real bullets, but as you can see, it looks like a firearm that can kill you,\u201d Chief Jacobs said. The shooting quickly drew widespread attention on social media, as people took sides to find fault with either the police or the boy. Chief Jacobs said the police were looking for video from security cameras or bystanders\u2019 smartphones, and were interviewing witnesses, including one of the people who was with Tyre. She said it was not clear whether that person would be charged with a crime. \u201cThere were witnesses, we believe, to the armed robbery and there were people in the vicinity of the shooting, but we don\u2019t know what they were able to discern,\u201d she said. The Columbus police do not wear body cameras, but they will starting next year, said Mr. Ginther, the mayor, who supports their use.'"}, "time": 1742628378.6875618}
