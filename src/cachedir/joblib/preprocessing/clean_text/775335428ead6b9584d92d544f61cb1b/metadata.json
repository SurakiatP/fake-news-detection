Jimmy Carter left his in his clothes when he sent them to the dry-cleaners. Bill Clinton had it in his wallet with his credit cards, but then lost the wallet. \\nOthers have chosen to give the card to an aide to keep in a briefcase, known as the \u201cnuclear football\u201d, together with a manual containing US war plans for different contingencies and one on \u201ccontinuity of government\u201d, where to go to ensure executive authority survives a first nuclear strike. \\nThe \u201cbiscuit\u201d and \u201cfootball\u201d are the embodiment of the awesome, civilisation-ending power that will be put in Trump\u2019s hands on 20 January.
