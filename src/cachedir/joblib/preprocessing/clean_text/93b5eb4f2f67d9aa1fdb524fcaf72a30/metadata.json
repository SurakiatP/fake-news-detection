This was an important year for the ITCCS (International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State), as the organisation got more and more momentum and started to reveal serious crimes committed by the Vatican, European royals and political leaders. Kevin reflects on the break with Alfred Webre who completely distanced himself from the ITCCS and it\u2019s work. \\nAs a result the initial momentum seemed to have stagnated, although behind the scenes the investigations into the crimes committed by religious leaders and heads of state continued. In order to pick up the pieces we look back at some of the dossiers and witness statements that were revealed at that time and in particular in regards to the revelations involving the Dutch and Belgium royals and Dutch political top. We discuss specific details that were brought up by the Dutch witnesses Toos Nijenhuis and Anne Marie van Blijenburgh in 2013-2014. The latter testified about torture parties and human hunting parties that involved children as prey, ordered by and paid for by the former Dutch Queen Beatrix, organised by her previous husband Kees van Korlaar, and attended by the Dutch political establishment, including the present Prime Minister Mark Rutte. \\nWe also talk about the dark forces behind ritual abuse and why Kevin likes to focus on the human aspect of things. Apart from restoring justice, the work of the ITCCS also involves creating awareness and inspire people to reclaim their own power. In order to end the energy transfer that does not only take place during ritual abuse, but also in other areas of society, people need to realize that the authority lies within themselves.'"}, "time": 1742628529.3006735}
