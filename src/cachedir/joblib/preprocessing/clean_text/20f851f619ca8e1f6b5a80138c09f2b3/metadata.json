And you may have no idea that something is different, because there may be no mention on the labeling even after a law passed by Congress last year to disclose genetically modified ingredients takes effect. A new generation of crops known as   rather than genetically modified is coming to the market. Created through new tools that snip and tweak DNA at precise locations, they, at least for now, largely fall outside of current regulations. Unlike older methods of engineering genes, these techniques, like Crispr, so far have generally not been used to add genes from other organisms into the plants. The federal Agriculture Department has asked companies to advise it of their plans. But once the companies submit data to show the agency that the gene edits do not introduce foreign genes from plant pests into the crops, the agency is giving businesses the green light. Hundreds of acres of   crops have already been grown in several states, unencumbered by oversight or regulations. And a few people have eaten them already. \u201cThis is not Frankenfood,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Choulika, chief executive of Cellectis, one of the companies developing   crops. In October, Cellectis hosted a dinner at Benoit New York, the Alain Ducasse Manhattan restaurant, and served dishes made from its   soybeans and potatoes. Guests included professors, journalists and celebrities like Neil Patrick Harris, the actor. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what gene editing is,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cI thought we were supposed to wear jeans. \u201d Calyxt, a subsidiary of Cellectis doing the   food, is also developing new versions of wheat including one with greater resistance to fungal diseases, another lower in carbohydrates and higher in dietary fibers. Other companies also developing   crops including DuPont Pioneer, which has used the technology for a new variety of waxy corn, used most commonly not for food but for starch in adhesives. Scientists at Pennsylvania State University have used Crispr to create mushrooms that do not turn brown as quickly. The current regulations were written for the earlier generation of genetically modified organisms, where scientists used bacteria and viruses  \u2014   typically from plant pests  \u2014   to drop a payload of new genes into the nuclei of the plant cells where they merge with the plant\u2019s DNA. That worked, but scientists could not control where the new genes would be inserted, and that led to worries of potentially dangerous genetic disruptions or crossbreeding with  . M. O. crops. Companies like Calyxt have portrayed gene editing more like moving the cursor in a word processor to a particular location and making a small change to the text. Federal agencies have not yet said how they intend to regulate   foods, and the incoming Trump administration, while criticizing overregulation in general, has not weighed in. Other parts of the world are also considering whether to regulate   foods and how to do so. In Europe, where many countries have banned the cultivation of G. M. O. s, the European Commission has created a scientific panel to study the issue, with debate resuming this year. Dr. Choulika said the inspiration for the October gathering was a dinner more than two centuries earlier, by   Parmentier, a French scientist who was enthralled with potatoes brought to Europe from South America. But many Europeans scorned the potato. France even outlawed the growing of potatoes in 1748. Largely because of Parmentier\u2019s work, potatoes were declared to be safely edible in 1772, and the ban was lifted. Still, few wanted to eat them. In 1778, Parmentier organized the first in a series of lavish dinners for the high society of Paris, serving dishes all made with potatoes. Potatoes became a fixture in French cuisine. With farmers harvesting the first substantial plantings of the Cellectis   potatoes and soybeans last year, Dr. Choulika thought of throwing a modern version of Parmentier\u2019s gathering. \u201cThis is the first dinner on Earth with   foods,\u201d Dr. Choulika said to the diners. \u201cThings that you eat today, millions of people are going to eat during the 21st century, and this will not stop. \u201d Food is a side business for Cellectis, which focuses on pharmaceuticals. After some collaborations with big companies like Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer, Cellectis started Calyxt, to explore opportunities for using gene editing for foods. Dr. Choulika said he considered G. M. O.s safe, but that the   techniques like those used by Calyxt would be more acceptable to consumers. Often in G. M. O. s, the inserted genes came from unrelated species, like the bacterial genes that were added to cotton so that it would exude a toxin to repel bollworms, a mixing of species known as transgenesis. \u201cThere\u2019s not this blockage of transgenesis that freaks out people for no reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is a question of perception. \u201d Instead of using bacteria and viruses to burrow into a cell,   techniques  \u2014   Calyxt uses one called Talen  \u2014   create molecules that act as a template to match a specific segment of DNA and then make a cut there. For the Calyxt soybeans, for example, the only change was to turn off two genes. \u201cThere is nothing taken out or added to the plant,\u201d Dr. Choulika said. \u201cIt\u2019s what nature would have produced. \u201d Those edits change the mix of fatty acids and perhaps make for a better cooking oil. \u201cBetter than olive oil,\u201d Dr. Choulika said. At the dinner, the soybeans were transformed into a several dishes including soy blinis, mini tofu and soy burgers, and soybean hummus. Carole Pourchet, director of the Lab, the research and development arm of Mr. Ducasse\u2019s food enterprise, said the   soy cooked like normal soy, but that the potatoes were a little drier, leading to the idea to confit them to retain moisture. The potatoes showed up in mashed potatoes, potato pie and blinis. \u201cThe dinner was maybe potatoes cooked 10 ways,\u201d said Richard C. Mulligan, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who was one of the guests. Dr. Choulika worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Mulligan\u2019s laboratory two decades ago. Federico Tripodi, chief executive of the Calyxt subsidiary, said the company hoped the soybeans would be used in cooking oil for commercial and industrial use by 2018. The potatoes, edited to remain fresher longer and not produce carcinogens when fried, could be grown and sold in 2019. A second potato that is slower to turn brown just got word from the U. S. D. A. that it, too, is not subject to regulation. Gene editing is not being used only with plants. A Minnesota company, Recombinetics, is editing the genes of farm animals  \u2014   for example, creating cattle without horns. Critics warned that the industry was repeating the same mistakes of G. M. O. s. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been against any of this technology,\u201d said Michael K. Hansen, a senior staff scientist at Consumers Union. \u201cWe don\u2019t say it\u2019s inherently bad or these crops are inherently dangers. It\u2019s just they raise safety issues, and there should be required safety assessments. \u201d While the   templates match a specific sequence, it is possible that the same sequence occurs elsewhere in the genome or they will match similar sequences, and the DNA will be sliced in those places, too, with unknown consequences. \u201cThey make it sound very exact,\u201d Dr. Hansen said. \u201cIt will have   effects. \u201d Dr. Hansen said unregulated   crops could also create trade havoc if traces of them accidentally mixed into exports to countries that prohibited them. Daniel Voytas, chief science officer of Calyxt who was one of the inventors of the Talen   technology, said the company had not checked the entire genomes of their plants, but did look for unintended changes within sections that were similar to the parts they were editing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find any,\u201d he said. Dr. Voytas said it would not be \u201ca huge amount of work\u201d to sequence the entire genome and that all of the data they presented was available on the U. S. D. A.\u2019s website. A U. S. D. A. advisory board in November unanimously recommended that standards for organic foods exclude   crops even if they were grown without chemical fertilizers and abided by the other strictures of organic farming. Dr. Mulligan of Harvard said he was not sure that people would see much difference between   and genetically modified. \u201cThe objection that people have is a more visceral and vague objection to messing with DNA,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see that the public would see the difference. \u201d He admitted that he was more excited by the chef. \u201cThe good thing with this is Ducasse is such a culinary artist,\u201d Dr. Mulligan said. \u201cHe is really well known for being able to take anything and make it taste good. \u201d For Mr. Harris, the dinner provided a whirlwind introduction to biotechnology  \u2014   \u201crealities that I thought were theoreticals,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742564243.0956419}
