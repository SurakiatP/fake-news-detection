{"duration": 0.0, "input_args": {"text": "'Such ugly, judgmental people. Just ugly. Ron Moore and David Eick would not have lasted out as long if the story was \u201csoooo terrible.\u201d Some people are just winey and cannot be satisfied for anything. BSG in Moore\u2019s world was gripping, thoughtful, edgy, educated, and dark. It was not all pretty, with a certain kind of human galloping in on horses, to save the day. Adama was not some all-good archon, with Tye being is lapdog. I grew up on the old version, and was \u2014 oppositely \u2014 delighted to see a version that made people think. This is why it lasted for 4 seasons, as well as had a spin-off called \u201cCaprica,\u201d and \u201cBlood & Chrome.\u201d They mythology lasted. I even use it to teach story and drama in my writing course. I cannot judge how this movie version will do, but I wish it well.'"}, "time": 1742628475.2843058}
