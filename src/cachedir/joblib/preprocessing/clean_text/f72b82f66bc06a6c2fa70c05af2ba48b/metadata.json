[Late on Wednesday, four rockets were launched toward the southern city, three of which were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. No damage or injuries were reported. Earlier on Thursday, the Islamic State Sinai Province posted an online statement taking credit for the rocket salvo aimed at Eilat.  Almaqdisi previously fought for IS in Syria and Mosul in northern Iraq, where he says he was injured. Without offering evidence, Almaqdesi claimed that in recent days Israel Air Force drones have taken part in raids on chapters of Wilayat Sinai, the Islamic State\u2019s Egyptian affiliate. Some of the casualties, he claimed, were Gazans. Breitbart Jerusalem submitted a request to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the allegations of drone strikes in the Sinai. Using   language, Almaqdesi, who spoke to Breitbart Jerusalem in Arabic, claimed that \u201cthe Jewish entity\u201d  \u2014   referring to Israel  \u2014   \u201cnever stopped assisting the Egyptian army of infidels in their war against the mujahedeen, and tonight\u2019s salvo on Umm Rashrash [Eilat\u2019s Arabic name] was a natural reaction to those crimes. \u201d The jihadist claimed the Eilat rocket attack wasn\u2019t a precedent. \u201cEarlier this month, we fired at the Elojah crossing [between Egypt and Israel]. Our brothers are determined to continue to react to the crimes of the Jews, and we\u2019ll continue to launch rockets at Israel despite their airborne operations and despite the strain of the Egyptian army of infidels. \u201d Almaqdesi claimed that only three days ago, an Israeli drone fired at a house in the Egyptian Sinai, which happened to be empty and therefore no injuries were caused. \u201cThe Jewish enemy continues its attack on the mujahedeen and innocent civilians, so they should anticipate more from our brothers the Sinai mujahedeen. \u201d Asked whether they plan   attacks on Israel, Almaqdesi said: \u201cIt\u2019s the decision of the brothers in the leadership, but it is clear to all that the Jewish entity is just one player in the war on Islam. Though a major one. Therefore, no option is off the table. It\u2019s true that the Jewish police arrest our mujahedeen even inside Palestine and the forces of the treacherous collaborator Abu Mazen do it too, and even those who are falsely called Muslims in Gaza fight against us. But our organization proved that we could strike anywhere in the world. I can tell you that our weapons are now aimed at Israel more than ever before. \u201d The Islamic State Sinai Province on Thursday released a statement taking credit the Eilat rocket attack: \u201cA military squad fired a number of Grad rockets at communities of Jewish usurpers in the town of Eilat. \u201d The group said the rocket attacks were meant \u201cto teach the Jews and the crusaders a proxy war will not avail them of anything. \u201d \u201cThe future will be more calamitous with Allah\u2019s permission,\u201d the statement said. In a   interview last March, Abu     a Salafist movement senior official in the Gaza Strip allied with IS, threatened that it is only a matter of time before the Islamic State\u2019s branch in the Egyptian Sinai carries out a \u201cbig operation\u201d in the Israeli resort town of Eilat and other parts of southern Israel.
