The administration\u2019s brief was the last in a series of urgent pleas to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which is now set to rule on the most ambitious and disruptive initiative of Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency. The ruling will almost certainly be followed by an appeal to the Supreme Court. The court scheduled an hourlong oral argument for Tuesday. That gives at least another day of reprieve to foreign visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, as well as other immigrants, who initially were blocked from entering the United States by Mr. Trump\u2019s order. The administration\u2019s brief largely tracked its earlier arguments that dismissing the ban outright would threaten national security and disregard presidential authority. But it also asked the appeals court, at a minimum, to reinstate at least part of Mr. Trump\u2019s order  \u2014   appearing to acknowledge the possibility that the government\u2019s case might not be successful. \u201cAt most,\u201d the brief said, the court order blocking the ban should be limited to \u201cpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future. \u201d That would allow the federal government to block people who have never visited the United States. On Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the administration stood ready to reinstate the entire ban. \u201cOnce we win the case, it will go right back into action,\u201d he said. Later on Monday night, Mr. Trump called threats \u201cfrom radical Islamic terrorism is very real. \u201d \u201cCourts must act fast!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter. Trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, which suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation\u2019s refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court. And none of the   rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case, State of Washington v. Trump. The Ninth Circuit scheduled the oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 3 p. m. Pacific time. It is to take place by telephone, and the court said it would be   on its website. Holding an oral argument by telephone in a major case is unusual. The case will be heard by Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush. At issue is the earlier ruling, by Judge James L. Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, that blocked the key parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. Judge Robart\u2019s ruling allowed immigrants and travelers who had been barred from entry to come to the United States, and it inspired a harsh attack from Mr. Trump, who accused the judge of endangering national security. On Saturday, the administration asked the Ninth Circuit for an immediate administrative stay of Judge Robart\u2019s ruling without hearing from the plaintiffs, the States of Washington and Minnesota. The court declined, instead asking for more briefs. Opponents of Mr. Trump\u2019s targeted travel ban made three kinds of arguments in their submissions to the appeals court, saying that the ban is unlawful, that it represents bad   policy, and that it is a threat to the nation\u2019s economy. A brief from Washington and Minnesota, filed early Monday morning, said that \u201cPresident Trump unleashed chaos by signing the executive order. \u201d Fifteen states and the District of Columbia  \u2014   including New York, California, Massachusetts and Virginia  \u2014   filed a supporting brief to argue that allowing the ban to stand would \u201ccause harm to the states, including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents. \u201d In a brief filed Saturday, the Trump administration argued that Judge Robart\u2019s order would cause irreparable harm to national security. In response, lawyers for Washington and Minnesota said that was not plausible, because it would mean the nation had long been suffering \u201csome unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. \u201d \u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d the brief said. \u201cAs this court has held, preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties. \u201d On Monday, the Trump administration responded that the states were asking the courts \u201cto take the extraordinary step of   a formal   judgment made by the president himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority. \u201d In its earlier brief, the Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious discrimination, even though Mr. Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president\u2019s motives, the administration\u2019s brief said, would violate the separation of powers. The states responded that \u201ccourts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants\u2019 true motives. \u201d They added that the administration had taken \u201ca dizzying number of positions\u201d on whether the executive order applied to permanent residents holding green cards. The order itself appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it will not enforce that part of the order. Questions about permanent residents are not moot, the states\u2019 brief said, as the administration could again change positions. Several former diplomatic and national security officials filed a declaration making a second kind of argument. \u201cWe view the order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,\u201d it said. \u201cIn our professional opinion, this order cannot be justified on national security or foreign policy grounds. \u201d The officials filing the declaration included John Kerry, a secretary of state under Mr. Obama Madeleine K. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser and Leon E. Panetta, secretary of defense and director of the C. I. A. under Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump\u2019s order, the officials said, would endanger American troops and intelligence sources, disrupt counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts, damage the economy and have \u201ca devastating humanitarian impact. \u201d \u201cAnd apart from all of these concerns,\u201d the former officials said, \u201cthe order offends our nation\u2019s laws and values. \u201d The third front in the legal battle against Mr. Trump\u2019s order was opened by the technology industry and other businesses. Almost 100 companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, urged the Ninth Circuit to continue to block the order, saying it \u201charms the competitiveness of U. S. companies. \u201d The \u201cinstability and uncertainty\u201d created by the order, the brief said, \u201cwill make it far more difficult and expensive for U. S. companies to hire some of the world\u2019s best talent  \u2014   and impede them from competing in the global marketplace. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561979.7292662}
