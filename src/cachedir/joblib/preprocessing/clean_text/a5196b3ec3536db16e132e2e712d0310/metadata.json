Is unable to control drinking once it has begun. Has withdrawal symptoms when the individual stops using alcohol. Needs to use more and more alcohol to achieve the same effects. Has a variety of social and/or legal problems arising from alcohol use. \\nBy that definition, Hillary Clinton is an alcoholic. Exhibit A \\nIn an email to Hillary\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta on August 8, 2015, Director of Communications for Hillary\u2019s campaign Jennifer Palmieri wrote, referring to Hillary: \\n\u201cI think you should call her and sober her up some.\u201d \\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of the email released by WikiLeaks : Exhibit B \\nOn Feb. 23, 2015, Hillary\u2019s spokesman Nick Merrill sent an email (presumably to Hillary\u2019s campaign staff) with the subject: \u201cHRC Clips\u201d (news clips on Hillary Rodham Clinton). The news clips that day included an article by Benjamin Bell for ABC News titled, \u201cOne Thing That Might Surprise You About Hillary Clinton,\u201d which Merrill reproduced in its entirety in his email. \\nBell\u2019s article was an interview with New York Times national political reporter Amy Chozick, on whether Hillary Clinton would announce she\u2019s running for the presidency. One of the questions Bell asked Chozick was: \u201cCovering [Hillary] Clinton, what is one thing that has surprised you about her?\u201d \\nChozick answered: \\n\u201cHmm. She likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008 and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in Pennsylvania. Um, no.\u201d \\nHere\u2019s a composite screenshot of the relevant part of Merrill\u2019s email, from WikiLeaks : Exhibit C \\nAccording to the National Enquirer , \u201ctop staffers\u201d of Hillary\u2019s campaign told the Enquirer \u201cthey even began this year\u2019s presidential campaign by secretly planning a stint in rehab for Hillary.\u201d But any rehab therapy \u201cquickly failed amid the pressures of the campaign\u201d and \u201cthe effort of making a deal over an FBI probe into her e-mail scandal\u201d. \\nA source said, \u201cThe stress of her political career, the never-ending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a life-threatening booze hell. She turned to drink to drown her fears. Hillary tries to hide her problem, like she lies about so many things.\u201d A \u201cclose friend\u201d of Hillary added, \u201c Hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater Bill. She\u2019s also hit the bottle to cope with other stress, as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was Secretary of State.\u201d \\nOne \u201cHillary insider\u201d told the Enquirer that Hillary \u201chas blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done \u201d and that \u201cShe\u2019s not fit to be President\u201d. \\nCertainly, Hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman (see below) because no sane person in her then position as U.S. Secretary of State would behave like this in public. \\n~Eowyn'"}, "time": 1742563233.07021}
