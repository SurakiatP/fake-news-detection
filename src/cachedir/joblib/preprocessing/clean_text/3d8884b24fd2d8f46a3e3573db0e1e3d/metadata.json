It\u2019s catcalls on the street, disrespect at work and unbalanced responsibilities at home. For girls, it\u2019s being taught, more than boys, to aspire to marriage, and for women, it\u2019s watching positions of power go to men. Men, however, don\u2019t necessarily see it that way. Those are some of the findings from the poll, by PerryUndem, a nonpartisan research and polling firm whose biggest clients are foundations. It surveyed 1, 302 adults in December via the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago\u2019s AmeriSpeak panel.   percent of women said sexism was a problem in society today, and 41 percent of women said they had felt unequal because of their gender. Men underestimated the sexism felt by the women in their lives, the survey found. And while most respondents agreed it\u2019s a better time to be a man than a woman in our society, only Republican men thought it was a better time to be a woman than a man. As women across the nation prepare to march in protest of an election in which gender loomed large, the poll results reveal nearly unanimous support for gender equality and policies that would help women  \u2014   but deep partisan divides in the perception of inequality and of who\u2019s thriving and who\u2019s losing in society. Many Americans seemed to think others had it better than they did, especially Republican men. Over all, only 37 percent of respondents thought it was a good time to be a woman in the United States. Fewer thought it was a good time to be a minority woman 24 percent said it was a good time to be a Latina, and 11 percent a Muslim woman. Republican men seem to see it differently. Just over half thought it was a good time to be a woman, while only 41 percent of them thought it was a good time to be a man. Donald J. Trump\u2019s rhetoric has appealed to people who feel this way. At his victory rally in Cincinnati last month, he said about women: \u201cI hate to tell you men, generally speaking, they\u2019re better than you are. Now, if I said it the other way around, I\u2019d be in big trouble. \u201d Dennis Halaszynski, 81, is a retired police captain in McKeesport, Pa. and a registered Democrat who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s easier being a woman today than it is a man,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe white man is a low person on the totem pole. Everybody else is above the white man. \u201d Women \u201cshould be highly respected,\u201d he said, but they are no longer unequal: \u201cEverything in general is in favor of a woman. No matter what happens in life, it seems like the man\u2019s always at fault. \u201d Democrats of both genders were much more likely to have felt unequal because of some aspect of their identity  \u2014   68 percent, compared with 47 percent of Republicans. Gender, race and religious views were the biggest reasons. The only reasons Republicans were more likely than Democrats to feel unequal were their religious views and military status. There is overwhelming support for gender equality in work, life and politics: 93 percent of respondents said they believed in it. But 43 percent of male Trump voters said it had already been achieved. Only 20 percent of those polled and 12 percent of women agreed. The disparity is partly because people define equality very differently, based on their politics and gender. A majority of respondents said the following things affected women\u2019s rights and equality: unequal responsibilities caring for children violence against women a focus on women\u2019s beauty and sexuality the lack of women in political office and positions of power sexism racism equal opportunities in the workplace and access to birth control and abortion. But in almost every instance, Republican men had a different view. For example, 51 percent of respondents but 24 percent of Republican men said a lack of women in political office affected women\u2019s rights.   percent of respondents over all and 36 percent of Republican men said unequal responsibilities caring for family affected women\u2019s rights. Even men who said women were still treated unequally underestimated the sexism that women experience. While 41 percent of women said they frequently or sometimes heard sexist language in their daily lives, 26 percent of men thought their partners did.   percent of women said they had been touched by a man in an inappropriate way without consent, while 31 percent of men thought their partners had. \u201cThe typical catcalling or comments or inappropriate gestures that men make toward you, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any women who haven\u2019t experienced that sort of harassment,\u201d said Cristina Hall, 44, who works in customer service in San Diego. But she was not surprised that men didn\u2019t realize it. \u201cI think when people don\u2019t go through certain experiences, it\u2019s hard for them to understand that it even happens,\u201d Ms. Hall said. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve never done it to a woman. Plus as women, we don\u2019t typically say anything because of fear we\u2019re not going to be believed or retaliation or shame. \u201d About 40 percent of women said acts of sexism would be more likely because Mr. Trump won, including sexual assault and feelings of entitlement among men to treat women as sexual objects. About a third of respondents said they were less tolerant of sexism in their own lives as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, and 43 percent of parents said it made them teach their children about sexual assault and consent. \u201cPeople seem to feel validated in their racist and sexist beliefs right now,\u201d said Tayler Lien, 22, a   college student in Las Vegas who voted for Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit scary. \u201d There was widespread support among large majorities in both parties for policies that would help women, like equal pay and paid leave. These have been rallying cries for feminists and progressives, and Republicans have traditionally opposed them. Congress failed to act on those policies during the Obama administration, but Mr. Trump has said he would push for them. Ninety percent of the respondents and 86 percent of Republicans supported the idea that the next president and Congress should work on equal pay laws.   percent of respondents supported policies improving access to   affordable child care, and 87 percent supported paid family and medical leave. Policies concerning reproductive rights were the exception to the bipartisan support.   percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats said they supported work toward protecting a woman\u2019s right to abortion from the next president and Congress, and 40 percent of Republicans and 80 percent of Democrats opposed getting rid of the part of Obamacare that offers birth control without a  . Peg Cherry, 83, a lifelong Republican who voted for Mr. Trump, said only     jobs were available when she was young. She worked   in retail and elder care jobs while raising five daughters. All five worked  \u2014   \u201ca feather in my cap,\u201d she said  \u2014   and so she supports policies like equal pay and paid leave. She thinks Mr. Trump will deliver. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to put his money where his mouth is,\u201d said Ms. Cherry, who lives in Lisbon Falls, Me. \u201cI think he\u2019s more likely to because, look, he\u2019s had his daughter in charge of a company and he could very well put a man in there. \u201d Ms. Cherry is not the only one pinning her hopes on Ivanka Trump for   policies.   percent of people, including the majority of Democrats, said they wanted her to help push forward on women\u2019s rights and equality. Despite the widespread support for gender equality and certain feminist policies, only 19 percent of respondents said they considered themselves feminists. There was no clear consensus on who best represented feminism today. The largest shares of people, both women and men, named two black women: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.'"}, "time": 1742563013.744517}
