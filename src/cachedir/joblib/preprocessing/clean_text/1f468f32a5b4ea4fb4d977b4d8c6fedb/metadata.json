Chuck Grassley fired off letters to two Cabinet agencies demanding answers about the illegal alien suspected accused of raping a    girl during school hours at Rockville High School. [Officials in the Maryland county where the alleged March 16 rape use their legal power to shield illegal aliens with criminal convictions from being sent home  \u2014   and Grassley wants to know how the Department of Homeland Security plans to stop the possible release of illegal alien suspects Henry E. Sanchez. Sanchez Milian, 18, and Jose Montano, 17.  \u201cMontgomery County, Maryland is a   sanctuary jurisdiction,\u201d Grassley asked DHS Secretary John Kelly. \u201cIf Montgomery County or any other local law enforcement agency declines to honor a detainer or notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) regarding Jose Montano and Henry Sanchez Milian, what action will DHS take to ensure that they are not released from custody and allowed to reoffend?\u201d Grassley also wants to review the agency\u2019s record of the suspects\u2019 immigration histories, criminal records, gang affiliations and immigration benefits. The Iowa senator also requested that Department of Health and Human Services, which oversaw young illegals from the Central American surge caught at the border and released into the U. S. under Obama administration policies, provide information about the illegal alien suspects\u2019 sponsors. Roughly eighty percent of the illegal alien minors were placed in the custody of other illegals.

There is almost no monitoring of the young illegals once they\u2019re shipped into the U. S. interior, an expert on illegal immigration told Breitbart News: \u201cThe federal office within HHS that is responsible for their resettlement has spent billions of dollars, but does little monitoring of the kids beyond one phone call to check in with the household. They say that many kids will not be at the address where they were resettled, and they lose track of most of them. \u201d Sanchez Milian and Montano allegedly dragged the young victim into a bathroom and forced her into a stall as she tried holding onto a sink. They allegedly raped the victim orally, vaginally, and anally, sometimes simultaneously, in a bathroom stall while she screamed, according to a police interview with the victim. A forensic specialist later found blood and bodily fluids in the boys\u2019 bathroom after the victim told school staff about the alleged attack. The alleged   took place a month before her fifteenth birthday, according to the date of birth marked on the detective\u2019s statement of probable cause. Sanchez Milian\u2019s attorney claims the alleged rape was \u201cconsensual\u201d and his client \u201cis being used as an unjust scapegoat by the opponents of recent immigration practices. \u201d Sanchez Milian and Montano face \u201c  rape and two counts of   sexual offense,\u201d according to WTOP. com. ICE has a immigration detainer request on Sanchez Milian, but would not comment on Montano\u2019s case since he is still a minor at 17.
