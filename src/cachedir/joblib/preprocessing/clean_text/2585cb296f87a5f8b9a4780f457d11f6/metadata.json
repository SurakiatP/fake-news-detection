Trump would defeat Hillary Clinton to win the presidential election, a private chat sprang up on Facebook among several vice presidents and executives of the social network. What role, they asked each other, had their company played in the election\u2019s outcome? Facebook\u2019s top executives concluded that they should address the issue and assuage staff concerns at a quarterly   meeting. They also called a smaller meeting with the company\u2019s policy team, according to three people who saw the private chat and are familiar with the decisions they requested anonymity because the discussion was confidential. Facebook has been in the eye of a postelection storm for the last few days, embroiled in accusations that it helped spread misinformation and fake news stories that influenced how the American electorate voted. The online conversation among Facebook\u2019s executives on Tuesday, which was one of several private message threads that began among the company\u2019s top ranks, showed that the social network was internally questioning what its responsibilities might be. Even as Facebook has outwardly defended itself as a nonpartisan information source  \u2014   Mark. Zuckerberg, chairman and chief executive, said at a conference on Thursday that Facebook affecting the election was \u201ca pretty crazy idea\u201d  \u2014   many company executives and employees have been asking one another if, or how, they shaped the minds, opinions and votes of Americans. Some employees are worried about the spread of racist and     memes across the network, according to interviews with 10 current and former Facebook employees. Others are asking whether they contributed to a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d among users who largely interact with people who share the same beliefs. Even more are reassessing Facebook\u2019s role as a media company and wondering how to stop the distribution of false information. Some employees have been galvanized to send suggestions to product managers on how to improve Facebook\u2019s powerful news feed: the streams of status updates, articles, photos and videos that users typically spend the most time interacting with. \u201cA fake story claiming Pope Francis  \u2014   actually a refugee advocate  \u2014   endorsed Mr. Trump was shared almost a million times, likely visible to tens of millions,\u201d Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies the social impact of technology, said of a recent post on Facebook. \u201cIts correction was barely heard. Of course Facebook had significant influence in this last election\u2019s outcome. \u201d This image of Facebook as a partisan influencer and distributor of bad information is at odds with how the company views itself, former and current employees said. Chris Cox, a senior vice president of product and one of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s top lieutenants, has long described Facebook as an unbiased and blank canvas to give people a voice. Employees and executives genuinely believed they were   and acting as a force for good, these people said. Facebook declined to comment beyond a previously released statement that it was \u201cjust one of many ways people received their information  \u2014   and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views. \u201d On Saturday night, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a lengthy status update to his Facebook page with some of his thoughts on the election. \u201cOf all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cOverall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other. \u201d He added: \u201cI am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves. \u201d The postelection questioning caps a turbulent year for Facebook, during which its power to influence what its 1. 79 billion users watch, read and believe has increasingly been criticized. Almost half of American adults rely on Facebook as a source of news, according to a study by the Pew Research Center. And Facebook often emphasizes its ability to sway its users with advertisers, portraying itself as an effective mechanism to help promote their products. Inside Facebook, employees have become more aware of the company\u2019s role in media after several incidents involving content the social network displayed in users\u2019 news feeds. In May, the company grappled with accusations that politically biased employees were censoring some conservative stories and websites in Facebook\u2019s Trending Topics section, a part of the site that shows the most   stories and issues on Facebook. Facebook later laid off the Trending Topics team. In September, Facebook came under fire for removing a Pulitzer   photo of a naked    girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, as she fled napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. The social network took down the photo for violating its nudity standards, even though the picture was an illustration of the horrors of war rather than child pornography. Both those incidents seemed to worsen a problem of fake news circulating on Facebook. The Trending Topics episode paralyzed Facebook\u2019s willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity, employees said. The \u201cnapalm girl\u201d incident reminded many insiders at Facebook of the company\u2019s often   approach to nuanced situations. Throughout, Mr. Zuckerberg has defended Facebook as a place where people can share all opinions. When employees objected in October to the stance of Peter Thiel, a Facebook board member, in supporting Mr. Trump, Mr. Zuckerberg said, \u201cWe care deeply about diversity\u201d and reiterated that the social network gave everyone the power to share their experiences. More recently, issues with fake news on the site have mushroomed. Multiple Facebook employees were particularly disturbed last week when a fake news site called The Denver Guardian spread across the social network with negative and false messages about Mrs. Clinton, including a claim that an F. B. I. agent connected to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email disclosures had murdered his wife and shot himself. On Thursday, after a companywide meeting at Facebook, many employees said they were dissatisfied with an address from Mr. Zuckerberg, who offered comments to staff that were similar to what he has said publicly. Even in private, Mr. Zuckerberg has continued to resist the notion that Facebook can unduly affect how people think and behave. In a Facebook post circulated on Wednesday to a small group of his friends, which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Zuckerberg challenged the idea that Facebook had a direct effect on the way people voted. In the   post, the chief executive cited several statistics about low voter turnout during the election. Then Mr. Zuckerberg wrote: \u201cSo rather than focusing on strengths or weaknesses in specific demographics, or other factors that may have pushed this race in one direction or another, these stats clearly suggest what many people have said all along. Both candidates were very unpopular. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562604.4792166}
