But her confirmation hearing that night opened her up to new criticism: that her long battle for school choice, controversial as it has been, is the sum total of her experience and understanding of education policy. In questioning by senators, she seemed either unaware or unsupportive of the longstanding policies and functions of the department she is in line to lead, from special education rules to the policing of   universities. Ms. DeVos admitted that she might have been \u201cconfused\u201d when she appeared not to know that the broad statute that has governed special education for more than four decades is federal law. A billionaire investor, education philanthropist and Michigan Republican activist, Ms. DeVos acknowledged that she has no personal experience with student loans  \u2014   the federal government is the largest provider  \u2014   and said she would have to \u201creview\u201d the department\u2019s policies that try to prevent fraud by   colleges. She appeared blank on basic education terms. Asked how school performance should be assessed, she did not know the difference between growth, which measures how much students have learned over a given period, and proficiency, which measures how many students reach a targeted score. Ms. DeVos even became something of an internet punch line when she suggested that some school officials should be allowed to carry guns on the premises to defend against grizzly bears. But if she was sometimes rattled on the specifics, Ms. DeVos was unshakable in her belief that education authority should devolve away from the federal government and toward state and local authorities. Whether the issue was allowing guns in schools, how to investigate sexual assault on college campuses, or how to measure learning, her answer was always that states and what she called \u201clocales\u201d knew best. Those answers reflected the same instinct that has driven her advocacy of school choice, primarily vouchers, which take money from public schools to help families pay tuition at private schools, and charter schools, which are publicly funded but typically independent of school district or union rules. As she said bluntly in a 2015 education speech, \u201cGovernment really sucks. \u201d Ms. DeVos\u2019s supporters defended her performance at the hearing, saying she showed herself to be a champion of innovation against Democrats\u2019 defending the status quo. \u201cThey tried their best to turn her into Cruella de Vil, but America got to see the real Betsy DeVos first hand,\u201d said Ed Patru, a spokesman for a group calling itself Friends of Betsy DeVos. \u201cThe country saw an authentic, compassionate and eminently reasonable education leader who is committed to empowering parents and putting kids first. \u201d With a   Senate, Ms. DeVos is still likely to be confirmed. But her statements on special education could make her vulnerable families of children with special needs are a vocal lobby, one that Republicans do not want to alienate. The federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, has governed special education in the nation\u2019s public schools since the  . Before the law, states and local school districts had been excluding or essentially warehousing students with disabilities. Complaints from states and local school districts have been less about the law than about the federal government\u2019s failure to pay its promised share of the costs. But at the hearing, Ms. DeVos questioned the basic premise that the federal government has a role in ensuring that any school receiving taxpayer dollars  \u2014   whether a traditional public school, a charter or a private school accepting vouchers  \u2014   comply with the law\u2019s requirements for students with special needs. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, last year\u2019s Democratic nominee for vice president, asked Ms. DeVos whether schools that receive tax dollars should be required to meet the requirements of IDEA. \u201cI think that is a matter that\u2019s best left to the states,\u201d Ms. DeVos replied. Mr. Kaine came back: \u201cSo some states might be good to kids with disabilities, and other states might not be so good, and then what? People can just move around the country if they don\u2019t like how their kids are being treated?\u201d Ms. DeVos repeated, \u201cI think that is an issue that\u2019s best left to the states. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s federal law,\u201d an exasperated Mr. Kaine replied. Mr. Kaine then asked if all elementary and secondary schools receiving tax dollars should be required to comply with reporting requirements on harassment, discipline and bullying. Ms. DeVos answered, \u201cI would look forward to reviewing that provision. \u201d Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire, pressed Ms. DeVos about whether she really intended to say that states could ignore the law. \u201cWere you unaware that it was federal law?\u201d Ms. Hassan asked. Ms. DeVos answered, \u201cI may have confused it. \u201d Ms. Hassan, who has a son with cerebral palsy, expressed concerns about private schools that accept vouchers on the condition that students waive legal rights under federal education law. \u201cDo you think families should have recourse in the courts if schools don\u2019t meet their needs?\u201d she asked. \u201cSenator, I assure you that if confirmed I will be very sensitive to the needs of special needs students,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about sensitivity, although that helps,\u201d Ms. Hassan countered. \u201cIt\u2019s about being willing to enforce the law to make sure that my child and every child has the same access to public education,   public education. \u201d In her opening statement, Ms. DeVos spoke of wanting to expand options for higher education beyond traditional \u201cbrick and mortar and ivy. \u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, asked Ms. DeVos whether she would enforce   education policies intended to prevent fraud at   colleges  \u2014   institutions like Trump University, which paid to settle federal class action lawsuits accusing it of using marketing tactics to enroll students. \u201cI will review that rule and see that it is actually achieving what the intentions are,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. Ms. Warren, in apparent disbelief, responded: \u201cSwindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like this. \u201d She added, \u201cIf confirmed, you will be the cop on the beat, and if you can\u2019t commit to use the tools already available to you in the Department of Education, then I don\u2019t see how you can be the secretary of education. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563714.6815379}
