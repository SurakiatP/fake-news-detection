Trump. In orange face makeup and pompadoured hair, Ms. Streep, the chameleonic   Oscar winner, did a more than credible version of the presumptive Republican nominee, down to the pursed lips and   belly. She got the   voice, too, even while singing. Ms. Streep was part of the Public Theater\u2019s gala benefit celebration on Monday night, a tribute to Shakespeare at the Delacorte Theater, home to Shakespeare in the Park. She was the closing act with Christine Baranski, doing \u201cBrush Up Your Shakespeare,\u201d a number from the Cole Porter musical \u201cKiss Me, Kate. \u201d \u201cWe could do a deal  \u2014   you\u2019ll let me know  \u2014   why it is all the women say no?\u201d she sang, stretching out her arms in a Trumpian gesture. Later she strolled the stage, gesticulating to the audience in Mr. Trump\u2019s signature     style. The song, traditionally a duet for men, offers advice for picking up women  \u2014   in this case, female voters. Some of the original lyrics were altered, but some could stand as is, for Mr. Trump\u2019s combative attitude: \u201cIf she says your behavior is heinous, kick her right in the Coriolanus!\u201d The crowd, which included Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor: the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power   Miranda and Bette Midler, loved it. Her performance came as something of a surprise to the event organizers, who knew only that Ms. Streep, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s, wanted to take on Mr. Trump. \u201cUtterly her idea, beginning to end,\u201d Oskar Eustis, the Public\u2019s artistic director, said after the show. \u201cThere were skeptics, there were doubters, but one of those skeptics was not Meryl Streep. She was absolutely sure she could do it. None of us had seen her in costume or makeup, till she walked out tonight. \u201d Ms. Streep skipped the dinner before the show to get into character, and spent time holed up in her dressing room. \u201cShe was showing us this thing that Donald Trump always does,\u201d said the actress Kate Burton, who shared the dressing room with Ms. Streep along with Ms. Baranski, Lily Rabe and Phylicia Rashad. \u201cHe apparently does this thing, where he goes to close to his jacket but it doesn\u2019t close all the way, and so he kind of goes for it and then he tries to close it again. \u201d It was a mannerism that only Ms. Streep seemed to catch, Ms. Burton said. \u201cShe treats this like she would her greatest roles: she\u2019s working on it all the time. \u201d For the show, she came onstage in a black suit, white shirt and overlong, clownish red tie. Her transformation astounded her cast mates, who had only glimpsed her with the Trumpian coif in rehearsal. \u201cShe showed up, and I thought, \u2018Meryl\u2019s having a terrible hair day,\u2019\u201d said the Shakespeare in the Park veteran Hamish Linklater. (Ms. Burton reported that Ms. Streep even used her own hair: \u201cShe did some funky thing with pins. \u201d) Other performers watched from the wings as she and Ms. Baranski, in a black   pantsuit, did their finale. \u201cShe\u2019s willing to try anything, and have fun with what she tries,\u201d Mr. Eustis said of Ms. Streep, who has appeared at the Delacorte several times in starring roles. \u201cShe\u2019s just fearless. \u201d Mr. Linklater, who played a comic Romeo in another number, called Ms. Streep\u2019s take \u201cnaughty. \u201d But, he added, Shakespeare \u201cwanted to be valuable to his times. And she gave a performance that was valuable to her times. So absolutely, she\u2019s honoring the spirit of the evening. \u201d On Tuesday afternoon, shortly after her name trended on Twitter with news of the Trump portrayal, Ms. Streep issued an statement through a Public Theater spokeswoman. \u201cI appreciate the interest, but this was a   a once in a (last in a) lifetime appearance of this character,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742563711.096349}
