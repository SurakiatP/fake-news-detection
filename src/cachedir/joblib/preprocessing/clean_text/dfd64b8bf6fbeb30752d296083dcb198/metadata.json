Marketing executive Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton \u201cmay not be the best face\u201d to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize \u201ctrending figures\u201d as par of an \u201cinfusion to pull younger voters\u201d because \u201cthat\u2019s the crap that young people pay attention to\u201d. Bronfein goes on to state, \u201cIt\u2019s f**king dumb but being \u201ccool\u201d counts for more than it maybe should.\u201d She references Bill Clinton\u2019s saxophone playing as an example of this before asserting, \u201cI hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they \u201cfollow\u201d. So if someone they identify as cool endorses \u2013 they will likely fall in line with that candidate.\u201d Bronfein is introduced to John Podesta in another email as someone who \u201ccould be immensely helpful in improving HRC\u2019s connection to millennials.\u201d The email is yet another example of the disdain that Hillary insiders have for Clinton\u2019s own voters. Yesterday, we highlighted how Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accused Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being \u201cstupid\u201d. In an audio recording leaked earlier this month, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape saying Bernie Sanders supporters are \u201cliving in their parents\u2019 basement\u201d and had bought into a \u201cfalse promise\u201d. In another email , Clinton operative Bill Ivey spoke of the need to maintain political power by producing \u201can unaware and compliant citizenry\u201d. \\nSUBSCRIBE on YouTube:'"}, "time": 1742563960.4464655}
