Mateen pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State during the shooting before police shot him dead.  The media has made little to no mention of the fact that a jihadist, influenced by a radical Islamic ideology, was behind this crime. Instead, most of the stories in the press have painted the incident as a generic form of \u201chate. \u201d An article in the New Yorker about the graveyard caretaker who looks after the plots of the victims of the massacre does not mention Mateen. USA Today similarly makes no mention of Mateen\u2019s radical motivations or his allegiance to a group hellbent on spreading an Islamic caliphate throughout the world. CNN ran an article highlighting five people who were either related to the victims of the Pulse massacre or survived the atrocity. CNN also failed to address the radical Islamic ideology behind the attacks. While they did mention the word \u201cterror,\u201d they chose quotes to highlight the views of those who believe in stricter gun laws, and one that blamed the incident squarely on \u201chate. \u201d The one person CNN quoted who believes in gun ownership as a form of protection as a result of what she survived said she does not believe in God. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that I am here because of God because, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t believe that God would take those people the way that they were taken,\u201d Jeannette McCoy told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing proud about being a survivor. Not for me. \u201d The Washington Post also failed to make any mention of Mateen\u2019s radical influence. As the Washington Free Beacon pointed out, \u201cDespite the Post\u2018s piece clocking in at over a thousand words, the words \u2018terrorism,\u2019 \u2018terror,\u2019 \u2018ISIS,\u2019 \u2018Islam,\u2019 \u2018Muslim,\u2019 and \u2018 \u2019 never appeared once. The sole reference to \u2018Islamic State\u2019 occurs in a photo caption, and never in the body of the piece. \u201d Breitbart News previously reported that Mateen said, \u201cI pledge allegiance to [Islamic State leader] Abu Bakr   may God protect him, on behalf of the Islamic State,\u201d during a 911 call about his assault. In that same piece, Breitbart News detailed how the media worked to \u201cportray Mr. Mateen as a scorned, mentally ill, repressed homosexual,\u201d but the reports on the incident \u201creveal one crucial point: Omar Mateen ranted at the police about America\u2019s fight against the Islamic State, mentioning the war and air strikes at least 20 times in total. \u201d Several other news outlets also failed to mention the keywords that the Washington Free Beacon mentioned their sole reference to Mateen pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. They include a Toronto,   news site, CP24 and the Associated Press. However, last year, the AP ran a headine with a quote from Mateen\u2019s imam who said the Pulse massacre \u201cHas Nothing To Do With ISIS\u201d and instead blamed it on mental illness. On Monday, the City of Orlando participated in what they have called \u201cOrlando United Day  \u2014   A Day of Love and Kindness\u201d to honor the lives lost one year ago today. In addition to a series of events taking place in the city and throughout other cities across North America, an event at Pulse nightclub called \u201cReflections and Remembrance\u201d began at 11 a. m. At 7 p. m. a memorial event called \u201cOrlando Love: Remembering Our Angels\u201d will take place at Lake Eola Park. The park is located at  512 East Washington Street.
