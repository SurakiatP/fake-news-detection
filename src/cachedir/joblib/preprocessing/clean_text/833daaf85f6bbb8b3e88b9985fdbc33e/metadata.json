Not a good start. \u25a0 The great potty coverup on The Mall: does the   not want \u201cDon\u2019s Johns\u201d visible on Inauguration Day? \u25a0 And readers get a chance to say what they would ask Mr. Trump\u2019s E. P. A. pick, Scott Pruitt. Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who will be Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, spoke with Sergei I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, the day before President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for election hacking, to arrange a phone call between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Trump once he becomes president, a Trump spokesman said Friday. Mr. Flynn\u2019s secret call did not violate the law, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokesman said. But under the circumstances, it is bound to raise eyebrows. \u201cThe call centered around the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and the   after he was sworn in, and they exchanged logistical information,\u201d Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokesman, told reporters on a conference call on Friday. \u201cThat was it, plain and simple. \u201d Several news organizations reported on Thursday on the calls between the two men. David Ignatius of The Washington Post suggested it could have violated the Logan Act, a    law that bars American citizens from negotiating without authorization with foreign governments that have a dispute with the United States. Mr. Spicer said General Flynn had initially reached out to Mr. Kislyak via text message on Christmas Day to wish him a happy holiday and to say that he looked forward to working with him in the coming administration. The ambassador sent a text back returning the sentiment, he added. The Russian envoy followed up on Dec. 28 with another text that asked if he could call General Flynn, and the two spoke, Mr. Spicer said. The call, which came the day before Mr. Obama announced penalties for Russia, including the expulsion from the United States of 35 Russian diplomats, never touched on the sanctions, Mr. Spicer said. It was bad enough that a new Gallup poll on Friday morning found that only 44 percent of Americans approve of the way Mr. Trump has handled his transition  \u2014   compared with 83 percent who approved of President Obama\u2019s transition and 61 percent who approved of George W. Bush\u2019s. That followed a Quinnipiac University poll this week that put Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating at 37 percent. But now, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a hero of the civil rights movement, is flat out saying he doesn\u2019t see Mr. Trump \u201cas a legitimate president. \u201d Elected Democrats are not only boasting of skipping the inauguration but are pledging to join the massive protest march that will follow on Jan. 21. Needless to say, this is not a good way to start a presidency. They are calling it the potty   of the 2017 inauguration. The Associated Press reported on Friday that workers preparing the Capitol grounds and National Mall for the inauguration of Mr. Trump have altered the portable toilets being set up to accommodate attendees, apparently to spare the ego of the  . The toilets are provided by the equipment rental company Don\u2019s Johns. But on Friday, a Capitol employee was photographed covering the company\u2019s logo with blue masking tape, and later, dozens of the   appeared to have been altered that way. The company\u2019s chief executive said he had no idea why his logo had been covered, telling the AP \u201cwe\u2019re proud to have our name on the units. \u201d It appears, however, that a certain somebody else is not. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised that with his   skills, we\u2019d be winning so much, we\u2019d get tired of winning. Marillyn Hewson, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, which makes the   fighter jet, delivered the latest victory: the cost will come down, as Mr. Trump has demanded. After meeting with the   she told reporters at Trump Tower, \u201cI\u2019m glad I had the opportunity to tell him that we are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft, and moreover it\u2019s going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States. \u201d She added: This is a bit of corporate spin for the incoming commander in chief\u2019s benefit. Shortly before the election in November, the Pentagon had imposed a price cut on the last group of   because Lockheed wouldn\u2019t budge. Then the Defense Department began negotiating the price for the next lot, and Lockheed understood that if it tried to fight another price cut, the Pentagon would have imposed it again. Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma, who spent years suing the Environmental Protection Agency to thwart its regulations, especially those that combat climate change, will appear before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Wednesday for a hearing to confirm him as head of the agency. The hearing promises to be among the most contentious of all the confirmation grillings, so The New York Times is reaching out to readers: What should senators ask Mr. Pruitt? The election was more than two months ago, the Electoral College ballots have been certified and the inauguration is a week away, but the   has not gone beyond campaign mode when it comes to Hillary Clinton. After the decision by the Justice Department inspector general to investigate James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, over his actions in the final days of the campaign, Mr. Trump went on a tirade. The leap to \u201cguilty as hell\u201d was a big one. The investigation will center on why Mr. Comey sent a public letter to Congress in the last days of the campaign announcing that the F. B. I. was reopening the Clinton emails investigation after discovering other messages on the laptop of Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide. Days later, Mr. Comey announced that the computer held no incriminating evidence. On Twitter on Friday morning, Mr. Trump again brought up the unsubstantiated, explosive dossier that a retired British intelligence agent compiled from information that he said Russia possesses. Mr. Trump likes to dismiss the \u201cfailing New York Times,\u201d but he clearly reads it closely. The Times published a lengthy history of the dossier in question that traces it to Republican and Democratic operatives who helped bankroll it to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Left unsaid are the respectable credentials of the British spy, Christopher Steele, or the fact that he is now in hiding, fearing retribution. By now, Mr. Trump\u2019s   concert has become a kind of reality show unto itself, marked by rumors of stars, leaks to the press, and occasional promises of an unforgettable show on the eve of the  \u2019s swearing in. The final details are in and the affair looks to be  \u2014   well, you decide. The concert is actually two. The first portion of the evening, \u201cVoices of the People,\u201d will feature performances by small groups from across the country. Think more D. C. Fire Department Emerald Society Pipes and Drums and Webelos Troop 177 than Beyonc\u00e9. The   have been reserved for the second part, which will be televised across the country and feature remarks by Mr. Trump himself. This part of the evening, \u201cMake America Great Again! Welcome Celebration,\u201d looks to be heavy on country music  \u2014   Toby Keith, Lee Greenwood, and a group calling itself the Frontmen of Country  \u2014   with some 1980s Broadway (Jennifer Holliday) rock (3 Doors Down) and a D. J. (RaviDrums) mixed in. Jon Voight, the    actor who narrated a video for Mr. Trump during the campaign, will serve as M. C. And a fireworks show by Grucci will close out the evening. And in case you were wondering, a news release announcing the details boasted that the show \u201cis produced and directed by Emmy Award winners and nominees. \u201d That would include Mark Burnett, the acclaimed reality television producer who worked with Mr. Trump on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and has helped plan the inaugural festivities. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s most provocative and persistent antagonists, Cher, is leading a new boycott of the   that aims to hit him where he will most certainly feel it: his Nielsen ratings. Under the Twitter hashtag \u201cTURNHIMOFF,\u201d Cher began Thursday night circulating her plea for people who oppose Mr. Trump to turn off their televisions when his inaugural festivities begin next Friday. \u201cRatings are what he understands,\u201d the singer and actress said in a phone interview. Cher\u2019s Twitter feed became one of the most animated and popular sources of   sentiment during the election. And the ferocity that she  \u2014   a    megacelebrity with nearly 3. 2 million Twitter followers  \u2014   used to go after Mr. Trump seemed to perfectly capture what a surreal turn American politics took in 2016. Senior national security officials for President Obama are hosting their counterparts on   Trump\u2019s team on Friday for a   exercise at the White House intended to practice the response to a major domestic or international emergency. The session, similar to one that George W. Bush\u2019s staff held in the restricted Situation Room for Mr. Obama\u2019s team just days before he was inaugurated in 2009, aims to familiarize the incoming president\u2019s team with the protocols and practices the federal government uses in a crisis. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said it would simulate what happens during \u201cmajor domestic incidents,\u201d including natural disasters. In the exercise in 2009, top Bush administration officials walked Mr. Obama\u2019s aides through what would happen in the event of an attack involving a series of explosions detonating in a number of American cities simultaneously. Maybe the new White House will conclude what \u201cWarGames,\u201d that 1980s movie, said about fighting a nuclear war: \u201cThe only winning move is not to play. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s foray onto social media Friday morning wasn\u2019t all anger and spittle. He praised his cabinet picks\u2019 performances before the Senate  \u2014   which have gone well, on the whole  \u2014   and the progress Congress is making toward gutting the Affordable Care Act. And: The House is likely to give final approval on Friday to parliamentary language that would allow Congress to eviscerate President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement with a simple Senate majority this spring, and without fear of a Democratic filibuster. What comes next is uncertain, and of grave concern to the 20 million Americans now covered by the health law and the millions more protected by its prohibitions on discrimination for   medical conditions and lifetime coverage caps. From the department of mixed messages: The House speaker said on Thursday that the United States would not send out a large force to remove thousands of unauthorized immigrants any time soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening,\u201d Mr. Ryan said during a CNN town   meeting in Washington, where a woman whose parents brought her to the United States at age 11  \u2014   a category of people often referred to as \u201cdreamers\u201d  \u2014   asked him, \u201cDo you think that I should be deported?\u201d Mr. Ryan said that Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of a deportation force would not come to fruition. \u201cI can see that you love your daughter and you\u2019re a nice person who has a great future ahead of you,\u201d he said, \u201cand I hope your future\u2019s here. \u201d When the moderator, Jake Tapper, reminded Mr. Ryan of the  \u2019s campaign promise to create a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, \u201cI know, I know. \u201d He continued, \u201cBut I\u2019m here to tell you, in Congress, it\u2019s not happening. \u201d Mr. Ryan has long supported an immigration plan that would mix new border security measures with protections for some unauthorized immigrants, but he has had little luck getting other Republican members of the House to join him.'"}, "time": 1742561741.6037657}
