[\u201cThank you, you have eradicated the Lampedusa cancer,\u201d read graffiti sprayed across walls on several streets of the small island with just 6, 000 residents after voters ousted Mayor Giusi Nicolini.  The Lampedusa native was kicked into third place at local elections Sunday, locals electing businessman Salvatore \u201cTot\u00f2\u201d Martello, who said during the campaign that he \u201ccannot stand seeing migrants swarming everywhere\u201d. Since taking office in 2012 the outgoing mayor transformed the island into a gateway to Europe, streamlining migrant processing to enable Lampedusa\u2019s reception centre to process and give shelter to 700 asylum seekers at a time,  moving most of them on to Sicily or the Italian mainland. Nicolini, who has used her status as a public figure to repeatedly promote open borders and acceptance of mass migration to Europe, was two months ago awarded the UNESCO Peace Prize for her \u201cboundless humanity and unwavering commitment to refugee crisis management and integration\u201d. And in October last year, the decorated mayor attended dinner with Barack Obama at the White House, brought along by Italy\u2019s   Minister, the unelected technocrat Matteo Renzi, as one of the people who represented the best of Italy. Following Nicolini\u2019s defeat, \u201cconservative activists joyfully posted altered images representing the former mayor as an illegal immigrant expelled from the country and memes claiming she is an agent of George Soros,\u201d according to the Washington Post, which described the Hungarian billionaire as \u201cthe liberal tycoon whom conspiracy theorists accuse of being behind the wave of African immigration to Europe. \u201d The outgoing mayor rushed to destroy and delete \u201cfiles, documents, private correspondence and entire folders\u201d from computers in her office upon her electoral defeat, telling the media: \u201cNo, I do not have time to respond to Martello, my priorities lie elsewhere. \u201d Questioning her haste in clearing the mayoral office, several Italian websites pointed to documents that emerged in 2014 which showed Nicolini signed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d with Open Society Initiative for Europe (OSIFE) in which the   agreed to let Soros\u2019 international funding network \u201chelp strengthen Lampedusa\u2019s capacity [to take migrants] and promote the island\u2019s population and its guests. \u201d Noting how, with so many African migrants arriving on boats, Lampedusa \u201coperates in a state of chronic emergency\u201d the OSIFE document asserts the island \u201cwill require manpower and expertise to complement its current workforce. \u201d Under the terms of the agreement, the funding body sent personnel to Lampedusa who set up \u201chumanitarian\u201d and \u201ccultural\u201d projects on the island,. \u201cThe agreement does not provide direct financing,\u201d the document states, explaining that \u201cOSIFE will provide the service via a person on the island with skills suitable for the purpose, and adding that funds allocated to Lampedusa will be sent to \u201cspecific bank accounts\u201d which must be used specifically for projects promoting mass migration. Last year, leaked OSIFE documents revealed Soros proclaimed that mass migration to Europe should be accepted as a \u201cnew normal\u201d carrying with it \u201cnew opportunities\u201d for the billionaire\u2019s cash to influence immigration policies on a global scale.'"}, "time": 1742564399.9927814}
