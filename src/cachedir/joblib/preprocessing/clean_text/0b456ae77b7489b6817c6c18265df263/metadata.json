Trump\u2019s nominee as energy secretary, said in his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday that he regretted having recommended the abolition of the Energy Department in the past. He addressed his awkward history on the issue up front, telling the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that after \u201cbeing briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy,\u201d he no longer believed, as he said while running for president in 2011, that it should be eliminated. Mr. Perry also offered a   reversal of his views on the science of   climate change, which he called a \u201ccontrived, phony mess\u201d in a 2010 book. \u201cI believe the climate is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by   activity. The question is: How do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn\u2019t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy or American jobs?\u201d Mr. Trump, by contrast, has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and has continued to express doubts about established climate science. Mr. Perry also appeared to signal a somewhat different position from Mr. Trump on nuclear weapons policy, the Energy Department\u2019s chief portfolio. Mr. Trump has said the United States must \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand\u201d its nuclear capability, \u201cLet it be an arms race,\u201d he said. But Mr. Perry, asked by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, whether he believed expanded testing of nuclear weapons was a \u201cdangerous idea,\u201d replied, \u201cI think anyone would be of the opinion that if we never have to test another nuclear weapon that would be a good thing for the world. \u201d He added, \u201cI think nonproliferation is a good thing. \u201d Asked if he would support the Iran nuclear deal  \u2014   which Mr. Trump has derided and which was largely negotiated by the current energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz  \u2014   Mr. Perry said he had not received classified briefings on it. \u201cIf D. O. E. has a role to make sure that Iranians are living up to the deal, message delivered, sir,\u201d Mr. Perry said to Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. Last month, when Mr. Trump offered Mr. Perry the job of energy secretary, he accepted with the understanding that the role would be largely focused on promoting American energy development, according to people who have briefed him. Only later did he learn that the agency\u2019s central portfolio is the oversight and management of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex, as well as 17 national scientific laboratories. \u201cThis confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me,\u201d Mr. Perry said, citing his conversations with Mr. Moniz, a nuclear physicist. He highlighted his experience as an Air Force pilot from 1972 to 1977 as among his qualifications to oversee the nuclear weapons complex. Mr. Perry is expected to be easily confirmed by the full Senate. But Democrats pressed him sharply on his views on climate science, noting that the Energy Department is a major science agency, with thousands of research scientists across the country. Democrats expressed concern that his past views, so at odds with established mainstream science, could be a serious impediment. They also pressed him on reports that Mr. Trump\u2019s team is considering making cuts to the Energy Department\u2019s offices of energy efficiency, renewable energy and fossil energy. The last is focused on research to lower   carbon emissions. Mr. Perry said he was unaware of such reports. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll have the same experience I had and forget that they said that,\u201d he said to laughter, referring to the moment in a 2011 presidential debate when, asked which agencies he wanted to eliminate, he could not recall the name of the Energy Department. What Mr. Perry later called his \u201coops\u201d moment was widely seen as sinking his campaign. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said, \u201cLike many of my colleagues, I am deeply concerned by some of the things that Governor Perry has said in the past about climate science. \u201d She added: \u201cThe Department of Energy\u2019s scientific horsepower is key to understanding these trends. I hope you can understand there is widespread anxiety about   Trump\u2019s intention to dismantle these scientific capabilities or simply just starve them for resources. \u201d Ms. Cantwell pushed Mr. Perry on whether he would protect the agency\u2019s budget for climate science. \u201cI\u2019m going to protect all the science, whether it\u2019s related to climate and all other aspects of what we are doing,\u201d he replied. Ms. Cantwell also asked Mr. Perry about a questionnaire sent to Energy Department employees by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team that appeared to target the agency\u2019s climate science research. Mr. Perry disavowed the questionnaire, saying it was sent out before he was selected as the nominee. \u201cI didn\u2019t approve it, I don\u2019t approve it, I didn\u2019t need the information, I don\u2019t want that information,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I manage. \u201d The hearing was leavened with some humor. Asked by Mr. Franken, who had earlier pushed him sharply on nuclear weapons and climate change in his Senate office, \u201cDid you enjoy meeting me?\u201d Mr. Perry responded, \u201cI hope you are as much fun on the dais as you were on your couch,\u201d before adding, \u201cMay I rephrase that, sir?\u201d \u201cPlease. Please,\u201d Mr. Franken replied. \u201cOh, my Lord. Oh, my Lord. \u201d \u201cWell, I think we\u2019ve found our \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 sound bite,\u201d Mr. Perry said.'"}, "time": 1742628597.6119535}
