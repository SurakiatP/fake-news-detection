The company, called Geofeedia, used data from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as nine other social media networks, to let users search for social media content in a specific location, as opposed to searching by words or hashtags that would be less likely to reveal an exact location. Geofeedia marketed its abilities to law enforcement agencies and has signed up more than 500 such clients, according to an email obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union. In one document posted by the organization, as part of a report released on Tuesday, the company appears to point to how officials in Baltimore, with Geofeedia\u2019s help, were able to monitor and respond to the violent protests that broke out after Freddie Gray died in police custody in April 2015. Geofeedia appears to have used programs that Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies offered that allow app makers or advertising companies to create   tools, like ways for publishers to see where their stories are being shared on social media. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram say they have cut off Geofeedia\u2019s access to their information. But civil liberties advocates criticized the companies for lax oversight and challenged them to create better mechanisms to monitor how their data is being used. \u201cThese platforms should be doing more to protect the free speech rights of activists of color,\u201d Matt Cagle, a lawyer with the A. C. L. U. in Northern California, said in an interview. \u201cWhen they open their feeds to companies that market surveillance products, they risk putting their users in harm\u2019s way. \u201d Instagram and Facebook terminated Geofeedia\u2019s access to their data in September, while Twitter shut off access on Tuesday. The response from the companies suggested that Geofeedia was using data from the companies in a way that was not allowed under their developer agreements. Jodi Seth, director of policy communications at Facebook, said that Geofeedia had access to data that had been made public on the social network, and that access was subject to the limitations in its platform policy. That policy asks developers to \u201cprovide a publicly available and easily accessible privacy policy that explains what data you are collecting and how you will use that data. \u201d It also asks that they \u201cobtain adequate consent from people before using any Facebook technology that allows us to collect and process data about them. \u201d Twitter said that based on the information found by the A. C. L. U. it was \u201cimmediately suspending Geofeedia\u2019s commercial access to Twitter data. \u201d Phil Harris, chief executive of Geofeedia, said in a statement that his company \u201cprovides some clients, including law enforcement officials across the country, with a critical tool in helping to ensure public safety while protecting civil rights and liberties. \u201d He said the firm has policies to prevent \u201cinappropriate use of our software. \u201d Mr. Harris added that the company understands that given how quickly digital technology changes, Geofeedia \u201cmust continue to work to build on these critical protections of civil rights. \u201d In addition to law enforcement agencies, the company has marketed its services to journalists as a way to find people at breaking news events for interviews and social media content. The New York Times used Geofeedia on a trial basis, but has not had access since 2015. The A. C. L. U. said it first learned about the agreements with Geofeedia from responses to public records requests to 63 law enforcement agencies in California. Those records, the organization said, revealed a significant expansion of social media surveillance. \u201cPosts on social media platforms can reveal information about our location, our religion, the people we associate with,\u201d Mr. Cagle said. \u201cUsers of social media websites do not expect or want the government to be monitoring this information. And users should not be at risk of being branded a risk to public safety simply for speaking their mind on social media. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564303.1310449}
