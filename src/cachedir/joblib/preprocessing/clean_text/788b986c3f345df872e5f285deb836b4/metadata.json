Most\u2014many\u2014of them are psychopathic thugs, murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct.\u201d \\nOverlooked is that many self-styled jihadis are indeed \u201cpsychopathic thugs, murderers\u201d; some may not even believe in Allah at all. Yet this does not exonerate Islam, for its \u201creligious construct\u201d was designed to entice such men. \\nAs usual , this traces back to the prophet, Muhammad. After telling his followers that Allah had permitted Muslims four wives and limitless concubines (Koran 4:3), he later claimed that Allah had delivered a new revelation (Koran 33.51) permitting him, Muhammad alone, to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted. In response, his young wife Aisha quipped: \u201cI feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires.\u201d (Apostates from Islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet.) \\nBut it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites. For whoever fights in the name of Allah and/or seeks to empower Islam\u2014that is, jihadis/terrorists\u2014is exonerated of all blame and, if he dies fighting, guaranteed the highest levels of paradise (where more sex awaits). \\nThat\u2019s because Allah made a \u201cpact\u201d with them. According to Koran 9:111: \u201cAllah has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods, and in return has promised them Paradise: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain\u2026. Rejoice then in the bargain you have struck, for that is the supreme triumph.\u201d Muhammad elaborated: \u201cLining up for battle in the path of Allah [jihad to empower Islam] is worthier than 60 years of worship.\u201d Moreover, The martyr is special to Allah. He is forgiven from the first drop of blood [that he sheds]. He sees his throne in paradise\u2026. He will wed the \u2018aynhour [supernatural, celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes] and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror [hell]. Fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor, a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains. And he will copulate with seventy-two \u2018aynhour. \\nAs for those Muslims who reject jihad, Muhammad said \u201cthey will be tortured like no other sinful human.\u201d (For many more Islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking, one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise, see here .) \\nThere is no denying that the historic growth of Islam is related to its carnal incentives. After more than a decade of preaching in Mecca, Muhammad had about 100 followers, mostly relatives. It was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied. So long as such fighters helped spread the banner of Islam into infidel lands, they were deemed good and pious Muslims\u2014regardless of their true intentions, priorities, or even faith. \\nMany of the original jihadis now revered in Islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics. Consider Khalid bin al-Walid: a Meccan pagan, he opposed Muhammad for years; but when the prophet seized Mecca, Khalid\u2014like many of Muhammad\u2019s foes, such as his archenemy, Abu Sufyan\u2014expediently converted, proclaimed the shahada , joined the winning team, and then went a-jihading\u2014mutilating, plundering, raping, enslaving, crucifying, and setting people on fire in the process. But because he did so under the banner of jihad, this serial killer and rapist is today one of Islam\u2019s most revered heroes. \\nThe reason for this is that nowhere in Islam is there talk about the \u201ccondition\u201d of the jihadis\u2019 \u201cheart,\u201d or if he\u2019s \u201cright\u201d with God. Allah is not God: he is not interested in \u201chearts and minds\u201d but in fighters and swords. So long as his fighters proclaim the shahada \u2014\u201cThere is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger\u201d\u2014and fight under the banner of Islam, they can take, plunder, murder, and rape the infidels; and if they die doing so, they go to paradise. \\nSuch was the genius of Muhammad: in the Arabian society he lived in, members of one\u2019s tribe were as inviolable as non-members were free game, to be plundered, enslaved, or killed with impunity. Muhammad took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale. Henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world: the umma \u2014which consists of all Muslims, regardless of race\u2014and the \u201cinfidels,\u201d who deserve to be plundered, enslaved, or killed with impunity for rejecting Allah. \\nThis explains why other tribal/nomadic societies\u2014Turks and Mongols/Tatars, whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribe\u2014also converted to Islam and, under the banner of jihad, continued preying on the other, the infidel, but now as venerated \u201cchampions of the faith.\u201d \\nChristian Europe was aware of Islam\u2019s true appeal from the very beginning. Theophanes the Byzantine scholar (d. 818) wrote the following about Muhammad in his chronicles: He taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemy\u2014or being slain by the enemy\u2014entered into paradise [see Koran 9:111]. And he said paradise was carnal and sensual\u2014orgies of eating, drinking, and women. Also, there was a river of wine \u2026 and the women were of another sort, and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure long-enduring [e.g., Koran 56: 7-40, 78:31, 55:70-77]. And all sorts of other nonsense. \\nCenturies later, St. Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) made similar observations: He [Muhamad] seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected; he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine\u2026. Muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his arms\u2014which are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants. What is more, no wise men, men trained in things divine and human, believed in him from the beginning. Those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all divine teaching, through whose numbers Mohammed forced others to become his follower\\'s by the violence of his arms. \\nThere is, finally, another group of Muslims who should not be overlooked. These do not give a fig for Allah nor wish to be \u201cmartyred\u201d in exchange for paradise, but they rely on Islam to justify robbing, enslaving, raping, and killing non-Muslims, as many Christian minorities in nations like Pakistan and Egypt will attest. Because their victims are just \u201cinfidels\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s a sin to aid a non-Muslim against a Muslim (that is, a non-tribal member against a tribal member)\u2014Muslim criminals target non-Muslim minorities precisely because they know Muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels. \\nIn short, enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is, in the words of the CIA\u2019s Brennan, \u201cterrorists,\u201d \u201ccriminals,\u201d \u201cpsychopathic thugs,\u201d and \u201cmurderers.\u201d Yes, they are. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is, as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad, paradise is assured them; and another group doesn\u2019t care a bit about the afterlife, but knows that, as long as they only victimize \u201cinfidels,\u201d no Muslim will hold them accountable. In both cases, Islam aids and abets their behavior.'"}, "time": 1742563612.349259}
