Organizers estimated that 400 people attended the veterans\u2019 protest on Sunday afternoon at Hampshire College in Amherst, billed as a \u201cpeaceful demonstration of freedom\u201d and \u201ca show of solidarity and respect\u201d for the flag and for veterans. Video taken at the event by Derek Cloutier, 34, a Marine veteran and a founder of the New England Veterans Alliance, showed American flags being waved on a campus green as protesters chanted \u201craise our flag. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really two demographics clashing in a sense,\u201d Mr. Cloutier said in a phone interview on Monday. \u201cThere are people that have family that have served or are veterans themselves, and then you have people who might not have anyone in their lives who might have served or don\u2019t know anyone like that. \u201d Students at Hampshire had lowered the flag to   on Nov. 9, in a \u201creaction to the toxic tone of the monthslong election,\u201d the college said in a statement. The following day, it said, officials decided to allow the flag to remain lowered for a period of time while students and faculty members at the college discussed and confronted \u201cdeeply held beliefs about what the flag represents to the members of our campus community. \u201d Some on campus perceived the flag as \u201ca powerful symbol of fear they\u2019ve felt all their lives because they grew up in marginalized communities, never feeling safe,\u201d the college\u2019s president, Jonathan Lash, said in a statement. Sometime the evening of Nov. 10 or in the early morning on Nov. 11, the flag was burned, an episode that campus police are still investigating. The flag was immediately replaced, and the college\u2019s board of trustees voted to continue to fly it at   \u201cto mourn deaths from violence in the U. S. and around the world,\u201d it said in an email. \u201cIf it was a political act, it was pretty craven and ineffective since people did it in secret and no one knows what it was meant to state,\u201d Mr. Lash, 71, said in a phone interview on Monday. \u201cAnd we replaced the flag the next day. \u201d But within a week Mr. Lash had sent an email announcing that the flag was to be taken down altogether, noting that \u201csome have perceived the action of lowering the flag as a commentary on the results of the presidential election. This, unequivocally, was not our intent. \u201d He added that there was not a campuswide ban on the flag, as had been mistakenly reported. Mr. Cloutier, who served in Falluja, Iraq, in 2006, said that he initially found the college\u2019s decision to fly the flag at   \u201cdisturbing. \u201d \u201cTo us who have been there and have friends that have died, it\u2019s like a spit in the face to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful for the college to blatantly do that without even considering the effect on veterans and people who have respect for the flag. \u201d Mr. Cloutier characterized the protest as fun and patriotic, and after attending it, he said, he thought more about the differing perspectives between the veterans and some students. Mr. Lash, whose father was an Army officer in the Pacific during World War II, became the president of Hampshire six years ago. He said that while he was not initially equipped to understand objections to the flag, his tenure at the private liberal arts college of 1, 400 was slowly teaching him to better understand those grievances. \u201cSo something that I have been learning about over the six years but I saw with incredible intensity after the election was the genuineness and depth of the fear of people who have grown up with racism,\u201d he said. \u201cWho look at the deaths on city streets and say, that could easily have been me. \u201d \u201cFor me the flag is still a really positive symbol,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019m coming to be able to maintain both ideas in my heart at the same time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628522.4554145}
