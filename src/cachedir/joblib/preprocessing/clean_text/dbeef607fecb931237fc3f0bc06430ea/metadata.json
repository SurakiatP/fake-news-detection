By using double stranded RNA, the potatoes have been engineered to resist the pathogen responsible for the Irish potato famine. \\nThere could be two new potatoes hitting the soil next spring after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signed off on two more genetically modified potatoes from Simplot, an agribusiness based in Idaho, on Monday. \\nThe only obstacle for the new potatoes becoming available on the market is a voluntary review process from the FDA, much to the chagrin of GMO skeptics. \\nJeffrey Smith, founder of the Institute for Responsible Technology, expressed concern for not only the FDA\u2019s voluntary testing program but for the genetic modifying process the potatoes have undergone, in an interview with RT. \\n\u201c It makes sense on paper, \u201d he said of the potatoes that are purported to be resistant to blight \u2013 the pathogen responsible for the Great Famine. However, one of the issues is that the effects of modified these genomes are largely unknown. \\n\u201c When we tamper with the genome in the way that they\u2019ve been doing with genetic engineering in our food supply, you end up increasing allergens, toxins, new diseases or other problems \u2013 causes massive collateral damage in the DNA\u201d he said. \\nBut blocking the blight is not the only selling point of these scientific spuds. In addition, they are meant to be engineered to prevent bruising and black spots, have a reduction of a chemical that creates carcinogens when cooked at high temperatures and also ship better. \\nHowever, all of these benefits could be a curse in disguise. The method used for engineering these potatoes is called double stranded (ds) RNA, meaning the genes of an organism have been reprogrammed or silenced. Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742564424.89822}
