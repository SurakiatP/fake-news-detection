Clinton no doubt calculated that voters would be more comfortable with her own steady finger on the nuclear trigger. I can think of no better proof of Mumford\u2019s contention than the fact that those voters would give any individual the power to abruptly end life on Earth unless it is that her statement went unremarked by those keeping score. \\nThe Nobel Mistake \\nLess than nine months into Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Norway\u2019s Nobel Institute bestowed the Nobel Peace Prize on him largely on the strength of his pledge during his first major foreign policy speech in Prague to rid the world of nuclear weapons. In a 2015 memoir, former secretary of the Institute Geir Lundestad expressed remorse for doing so, saying \u201c[We] thought that it would strengthen Obama and it didn\u2019t have that effect.\u201d President Barack Obama uncomfortably accepting the Nobel Peace Prize from Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland in Oslo, Norway, Dec. 10, 2009. (White House photo) \\nLike all modern presidents, Obama quickly learned the political economy of the entrenched nuclear establishment, committing a trillion dollars to the \u201cmodernization\u201d of the arsenal and its delivery systems 30 years beyond his presidency. \\nAs Obama prepared to leave office, his Defense Secretary Ashton Carter rejected pleas for reducing the stockpile and announced that the Pentagon planned to spend $108 billion over five years to \u201ccorrect decades of underinvestment in nuclear deterrence \u2026 dat[ing] back to the Cold War.\u201d The last Cold War, that is. \\nSuch staggering expenditures are, however, even more unlikely to purchase the order and security that Secretary Carter promised than when Mumford issued his warning. That was well before thousands of thermonuclear weapons waited on hair-trigger alert for the order to launch or a glitch that would do so without an order. \\nIn his recently published book My Journey At the Nuclear Brink , Bill Clinton\u2019s Defense Secretary William Perry detailed the numerous close calls by which the world has dodged partial or all-out Armageddon and claimed that the likelihood of disaster is growing rather than diminishing. Most of these events are unknown to the public. \\nFormer head of the U.S. Strategic Command General James Cartwright bolstered Perry\u2019s claim when he told a San Francisco audience that \u201cIt makes no sense to keep our nuclear weapons online 24 hours a day\u201d since \u201cYou\u2019ve either been hacked and are not admitting it, or you\u2019re being hacked and don\u2019t know it.\u201d One of those hackers, he said, could get lucky. \\nA Non-existent Debate \\nWhen Hillary Clinton was asked at a town hall event in Concord, New Hampshire, if she would reduce expenditures for nuclear arms and rein in the corporations that sell the government those weapons, she replied \u201cI think we are overdue for a very thorough debate in our country about what we need and how we are willing to pay for it.\u201d Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix, Arizona.   by Gage Skidmore) \\nSuch a debate has never been held and \u2014 given the peril, complexity and cost of nuclear technology \u2014 it is never likely to happen unless a president of exceptional courage and independence demands it. The profits of weapons production are simply too great and few of the prospective victims understandably want to dwell on the unthinkable when so much more diverting entertainment is available on their Smartphones. \\nNuclear weapons by their nature are inimical to transparency and thus to the public discussion, control and democracy they ostensibly protect. Nor does Doomsday make for winning dinner banter. \\nThe Brookings Institute in 1998 published a study of the cumulative costs of nuclear weapons entitled Atomic Audit . It put the bill to date at $5.5 trillion, virtually none of which was known by the public or even to members of Congress or the President. The cost simply grew and continues to grow in the dark, precluding spending on so much else that might otherwise return in public works and services to those who unwittingly pay for the weapons while also mitigating the causes of war abroad. \\nIf she wins, Hillary Clinton\u2019s election to the Presidency will be hailed as historic, but not nearly as historic as if she would sponsor that \u201coverdue\u201d and \u201cvery thorough debate\u201d of which she spoke in the city of Concord. Such a debate might begin to lift from her own shoulders \u2014 and from those of her successors if there are to be any \u2014 what she called \u201cthe awesome responsibility\u201d of four minutes to launch. That way lies sanity after 70 years of its opposite. \\nDr. Gray Brechin is the Project Scholar of the Living New Deal University at the UC Berkeley Department of Geography.
