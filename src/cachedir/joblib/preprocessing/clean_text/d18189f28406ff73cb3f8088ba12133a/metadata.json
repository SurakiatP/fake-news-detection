In concert, he also announced an upgraded model of the company\u2019s energy-storing Powerwall. \\nThe Powerwall 2 is a battery for homes and small businesses that stores the sun\u2019s energy and delivers clean, reliable electricity, even when the sun isn\u2019t shining. \\nAccording to a report by Wired : \\nA couple hundred invited guests, mostly Tesla owners, ooh-ed and ahh-ed as Musk revealed that a row of suburban American houses on Wisteria Lane\u2014the old set of Desperate Housewives\u2014were all, in fact, topped with solar roofs. Each house\u2019s old roofing material had been stripped away, and replaced with one of four new styles of solar tile. From the street, it was virtually impossible to tell; the roofs retained a variety of traditional looks, from textured slate shingle to terra cotta tile. \\nMusk said the secret to the tiles\u2019 appearance is a special coating that becomes more or less see-through depending on your viewing angle. He described it as a series of micro louvers that work like a privacy screen on a laptop, and said the company is working with 3M on the tech. The effect is dramatic in person. From shallow angles, the tiles appear nontransparent. But as your viewing angle approaches 90 degrees, the underlying solar cell becomes more and more visible. The result is a tile that permits the passage of sunlight from overhead, but still looks opaque to anyone at ground level. \\nDuring the presentation, Musk revealed the durability of the glass tile by showing drop tests that showed the tiles to be tougher than commonly used roofing materials, such as slate or clay. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to wear out, it\u2019s made of quartz, it has a quasi-infinite lifetime,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe need to make solar panels as appealing as electric cars have become,\u201d added Musk. \u201cIt needs to be beautiful, affordable, and seamlessly integrated. If all of those things are true, why would you go any other direction?\u201d \\nThe solar roof is designed to be used in concert with the Tesla Powerwall 2.0, which Musk also unveiled at his Los Angeles presentation. The new version of the Powerwall will cost $5,500 for 14kWh of storage and 7kWh peak power draw, which is enough to power a four-bedroom home for one day. No details on pricing, availability, or the installation process for the solar roof was announced. \\nMusk envisions a day when people can walk into a Tesla store and buy an entire energy system, which includes a solar roof/panels, a Powerwall battery for energy storage and an electric car. \\nThe reality is that Musk is creating a system that could eventually replace the entire traditional electrical grid, and allow for true off-grid energy independence. The idea is that you can generate and store energy by day, which then lights up your house at night \u2013 without any pollution or environmental damage. \\n\u201cIn order to make his vision move forward, Musk is using design with a big D,\u201d Andy Ogden, Chair of the Industrial Design Department at ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, California told Wired. \u201cHe\u2019s thinking about an overall strategy, in how these things interact and support each other, so there\u2019s some synergy.\u201d \\nOgden believes that Musk\u2019s plan has the potential to work. \u201cIf he can make it easier, and less expensive and more attractive for roofs to be solar, then that will drive the uptake of battery systems\u201d \\nThis latest revolution in the energy industry comes as Musk\u2019s merger with SolarCity (the largest provider of solar power systems in the country), which is run by Musk\u2019s cousin and of which Musk is already the majority stockholder, will be voted on by shareholders on November 17. Musk\u2019s recent announcement of the new Tesla solar tiles would seemingly be a perfect fit with the Solar City brand. \\nThanks to Elon Musk the future of clean energy has never looked brighter. \\nPlease share this amazing story about the coming energy revolution!
