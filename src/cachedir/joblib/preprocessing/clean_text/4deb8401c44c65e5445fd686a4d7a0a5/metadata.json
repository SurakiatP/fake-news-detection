Source:Ekaterina Chesnokova/RIA Novosti \\nEven during the stage of production, Alexei Mizgirev\u2019s The Duelist caught the attention of the international cinema industry. The world premiere of the movie was held the Toronto Film Festival and, in collaboration with IMAX, the film is being released in the U.S. and other countries. \\nBefore The Duelist, Mizgirev was considered to be only a \u201cfestival\u201d director in Russia \u2013 all his previous pictures had gone out on limited release, and were seen by only a few thousand people. However, suddenly, in cooperation with producer Alexander Rodnyansky ( Jayne Mansfield\u2019s Car , Cloud Atlas , Leviathan ), he has made one of the most expensive projects in the history of Russian cinema. \\nSet in the 1860s, The Duelist is a costume drama about a killer, the officer Yakovlev, who engages in duels for other people. For some mystical reason bullets cannot kill him, so he always wins his duels. \\nBefore the film released, Mizgirev spoke to RIR about his new film. \\nRIR: How does it feel, after directing only low-budget auteur films, to be a director of a film that cost such a large amount of money, going by standards of the Russian film industry? \\nAlexei Mizgirev: People ask me this a lot. At first I was a bit lost and didn\u2019t know how to answer, because I hadn\u2019t really noticed a big difference. With The Duelist we had no problems, for example with decoration and costume, because we could shoot where we wanted and didn\u2019t have to save on props. I was now rid of many problems that had cropped up in previous films, because the producers were able to solve them perfectly. \\nVideo by SonyPicturesRU / YouTube \\nThis was all very pleasant. However such changes indirectly affect the creative process. We were constantly discussing points to work on, but it was all very democratic, because we both understood that there are mass-produced, cookie-cutter films, and others that are single, unique pieces. The Duelist is a unique film, in which individuality and the author\u2019s style is important \u2013 with the background of a great story and modern visual effects, of course. \\nRIR: All your preceding films have been about acute social issues in modern Russian life. And here we have balls, costumes, duels, and nobles in waistcoats. Where has this interest in this period come from? \\nA.M.: Any director wants millions of people to watch his films. But when you\u2019re given a budget of $1-2 million, it\u2019s difficult to create beautiful and spectacular cinema . You would like to, but it\u2019s impossible for objective reasons. Therefore, an interest in contemporary affairs is in some respects necessary, simply because you don\u2019t have to waste money on expensive decorations and computer effects. \\nThe concept of The Duelist has already been in the works for several years, it was just lying somewhere, literally two paragraphs long. And then something happened, and I thought to myself, this needs to happen now. Even though realizing this idea was very far off, I already thought then that the biggest problem I\u2019d have with it would not be to do with finance. \\nRIR: What sort of difficulties are you talking about? \\nA.M.: I am talking about the 19 th century itself, or rather, its image, which is difficult to portray in audiovisual art. You probably won\u2019t disagree that Russian viewers only know about the 19 th century from TV series, since the last proper film made for the big screen was [Vladimir Motyl\u2019s] The Captivating Star of Happiness , shot in 1975. But even this film was riddled with a mass of clich\u00e9s and openly mistaken information about the 19 th century. \\nA common film market for Russia, India and China? \\nWhen I was preparing for The Duelist I sifted through a mass of sources on this period. It turns out that we don\u2019t really know anything about them, what they really ate, drank, talked about, and how they really dressed, apart from some pleasant misconceptions we have. The 19 th century for the contemporary viewer is a load of old mothballs at granny\u2019s place or some sedate play from a provincial theatre. \\nI\u2019d like to get rid of this stereotype and show this period like no one else has done \u2013 bright, harsh, echoing with our times. This is of course a grandiose task, but I\u2019m not afraid of the work, or the public reaction to this new style of discussion about the past. This is a complete breaking of the mould. \\nRIR: However the visual style of The Duelist has several times been compared to Sherlock Holmes by Guy Ritchie and the film Vidoqc by Pitof. Do you like having such parallels with your work? \\nA.M.: Such comparisons have a lot of truth in them. However this is a very decorative work, a celebration of the genre in its purest form. The Duelist is a little different, including if we talk about its visual effects. \\nRIR: With The Duelist , everyone asks you about the idea of honour, which is the main trigger for the film. You answer, expectedly, that honour is a timeless thing, and for this reason a story about this will always resound with the present. But it seems in your film fatalism plays just as important a role, one which is peculiar to the film\u2019s characters. We\u2019re guessing that this emphasis on the doomed characters\u2019 relationship with fate is not an accidental one? \\nA.M.: Yes, this is one of the driving forces of the film. Delving into stories about duels, I stumbled across an eloquent fact. In the 19 th century, in the birthplace of duels, France, they practically disappeared, like in many other countries. This is linked to the spread of firearms, which were far more dangerous than swords and which greatly levelled the playing field. \\nFor exactly this reason, duels flourished in Russia, I think for the most part thanks to fatalism, which to this day remains as one of the principle characteristics of the Russian mentality. Sink or swim \u2013 it is very much our thing, even if we are talking about life and death. The Duelist is precisely about this. Facebook'"}, "time": 1742563243.425301}
