[Fleitz said he\u2019s still hopeful that there could be an investigation into Loretta Lynch, \u201cI really hope so,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that was the criminal activity of the 2016 campaign. Why was the law not enforced concerning the Clinton email server, the mishandling of classified information, the Clinton Foundation, and what I think are numerous instances of foreign governments trying to buy influence with a prospective president?\u201d  \u201cThere are clear instances of    with the Clinton Foundation,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe email server broke so many laws. If I had done a small fraction of the things connected with that incident I\u2019d have lost my job, I\u2019d have enormous legal bills and frankly, I think I\u2019d be serving prison time. \u201d Fleitz added that he hopes Lynch and other Obama officials are questioned by the Senate. Said Fleitz of the Democrats, \u201cIf they\u2019re going to pursue this route, this relentless series of pointless and false investigations of President Trump, let\u2019s investigate Hillary Clinton and all the criminal activity that she is clearly responsible for. \u201d As regards American college student Otto Warmbier, Fleitz Said, \u201cThis is just such a terrible story. The North Korean government murdered this young man. They murdered him. And we know that North Korea is a criminal regime. But what I\u2019m very angry about is how the Obama administration did almost nothing to get him back. \u201d \u201cThere were no consular visits,\u201d Fleitz continued, \u201cwhich are required under international law by the state representing us, Sweden, to check on him while he was in prison. There were none. \u201d Fleitz continued to blast the Obama administration for dropping the ball. \u201cA young man who was his hotel roommate before he was arrested, he\u2019s a British citizen, says the Obama administration never contacted him to find out the particulars of why he was arrested. The Obama administration said to the Warmbier family, stay silent, do nothing, and the Obama administration pursued their idiotic policy of strategic patience, which we now know was an utter failure. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
