Quite unfairly, writer Asawin Suebsaeng did not give Will Ferrell the chance to respond to the calumnious comparison. [The Media Matters founder seeks to make his Shareblue site (please click on the link \u2014  they could use the traffic) \u201cthe Breitbart of the Left. \u201d But as Breitbart News ranks as the 41st most read website in the United States and Shareblue comes in as the 19, 198th, the aspiration comes across more as a delusion \u2014  the kind of thing someone who insists \u201cI invented the   necktie\u201d would say.  Several of Brock\u2019s fellow Democratic operatives wish they could trade him back to the Right. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that his groups were the least effective of 2016,\u201d one tells the Daily Beast. \u201cIf anything they did harm. \u201d The gist of the piece centers on whether a guy not in total control of himself should hold any control over the Democratic Party. \u201cI hope Hillary truly understands now how bat$#!+ crazy David Brock is,\u201d Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden told John Podesta in an email exposed by WikiLeaks last summer. The Daily Caller reported in 2012 of a paranoid Brock hiring armed guards to protect him from potential assassins, with this supersecret service allegedly whisking him off a Washington, D. C. roof for fear of invisible Lee Harvey Oswalds lurking in nearby windowsills. In 2002, the Drudge Report alleged that Brock \u201csuffered a breakdown last summer and was committed to the psychiatric ward of Sibley Hospital in Northwest Washington. \u201d A source, alleging delusions and paranoia, told Drudge, \u201cHe spent time in the \u2018The Quiet Room,\u2019 there was just a mattress on the floor, and he had some books. He was so tired and stressed. \u201d Whether Brock belongs in such a place, his boys irregular, a cross between Phil Donahue\u2019s do and Grandma Walton\u2019s coif, certainly does. Aside from the supposed delusions and paranoia, Brock harbors an obsession: Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton once served as the focus of his fixations. But in an act similar to what psychiatrists call \u201ctransference,\u201d Brock shifted his monomania from Hillary to the Donald, only in doing so his emotions went from positive to negative (like Mugatu\u2019s   dynamic with assistant Todd). Shareblue\u2019s front page currently features nine articles. All nine focus on Donald Trump. A Breitbart of the Left might include sports, celebrity, and gamer stories. Shareblue reads as all Trump all the time. The Donald consumes Brock the way Derek consumes Mugatu. That\u2019s probably why consumers avoid Shareblue the way they did Derelicte. One article wonders if administration language indicating that Trump \u201creceives\u201d and \u201cparticipates\u201d in his daily briefing really means he does not read it. \u201cNow that he has taken office, it appears that Trump may even be eschewing the normal Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) process, in favor of  \u201d Tommy Christopher writes. Another piece by Alison R. Parker covers a speech by the \u201cdemagogue\u201d president \u201cfilled with his typical bluster and fearmongering\u201d that announced the withholding of federal funds from sanctuary cities, a \u201ctumultuous and troubling reality. \u201d Diana E. Anderson, in noting similarities between Bill O\u2019Reilly and the president\u2019s takes on violence in Chicago, concludes, \u201cFox News appears to have extraordinary power over the new president  \u2014   and that should scare all of us. \u201d This is the \u201cBreitbart of the Left\u201d? Less Mugatu, more Milo.'"}, "time": 1742563615.5129182}
