Miller believes that the roles of entertainers have changed drastically with the election of President Donald Trump. [In an interview with the Wrap this week, the Silicon Valley star  \u2014   whose first HBO   special, Meticulously Ridiculous, premiered Saturday  \u2014   said his whole approach to his craft has changed now that Trump, whom he called \u201cthis mother***er in the White House,\u201d was elected in November.  \u201cIt used to be different  \u2014   before it was, \u2018What is absurdist?\u2019 Then this mother***er in the White House totally changed everything for everyone,\u201d the    actor told the outlet. \u201cImmediately after the election, Kumail Nanjiani was walking around the set of Silicon Valley saying, \u2018Everything\u2019s changed now  \u2014   standup, everything.\u2019 Now, I have a political obstacle to a social mission, and the f*ckery that must be dealt with,\u201d he added. Miller has previously spoken out against the president during his hosting gig at the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards in December, the actor joked that trolls did well in 2016, \u201cnot the movie, but the dudes on the Internet,\u201d adding: \u201cOne of them got elected president. \u201d Miller also stood on an actual \u201csoap box\u201d for a segment about how celebrities should stick to doing their jobs instead of trying to opine on politics. \u201cAll I want to do is talk about what\u2019s going on in the world, but the problem is, I hate when celebrities get on their soap box,\u201d Miller said. \u201cJust do your act. Don\u2019t tell the rest of us how to think, O. K.?\u201d A few days before the awards show, the Office Christmas Party actor was arrested after allegedly slapping an Uber driver during what was reported to be an argument between the two about    Trump. While a large number of Hollywood stars have taken their political activism to new heights since Trump\u2019s election, not every celebrity believes it is the obligation of entertainers to discuss political topics. A number of celebrities, including Mark Wahlberg, Billy Joel, and Kevin Hart have said explicitly in the past that they prefer to stay away from talking about their personal politics.
