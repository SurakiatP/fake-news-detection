But even members of his own party questioned some of the cuts  \u2014   and what was not being cut. The harshest criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget came from Democrats and liberal organizations. But in a city where many federal programs enjoy longstanding bipartisan support, some Republicans also assailed the president\u2019s judgment. \u201cWhile we have a responsibility to reduce our federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the president\u2019s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive,\u201d said Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cWe will certainly review this budget proposal, but Congress ultimately has the power of the purse. \u201d The spending plan\u2019s bottom line is roughly the same as in President Barack Obama\u2019s last budget request, but it marks Mr. Trump\u2019s first major attempt to dismantle what his aides dismissively call the \u201cadministrative state. \u201d The $1. 1 trillion spending plan envisions deep cuts to many government programs while leaving entitlement programs like Social Security untouched. It increases spending on the military and border security. Mr. Trump was elected on a promise to wage war against what he has frequently mocked as a bloated and ineffective federal work force, and he is betting that his first budget will help consolidate support by calling for a significant shift of resources away from established programs that aid the poor, the environment, foreigners and the arts. To those who object to deep cuts in those programs, Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s budget director, had a blunt message on Thursday: What did you expect? He said that   programs had failed to help children in schools, that housing programs were \u201cnot well run,\u201d that government health research had suffered \u201cmission creep\u201d and that grants to local communities \u201cdon\u2019t do any good. \u201d Mr. Mulvaney waved aside questions about cuts to the United Nations, saying that they \u201cshould come as a surprise to no one who watched the campaign. \u201d And he said that the president made no apologies for eliminating the government\u2019s efforts to curb climate change. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending money on that anymore,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe consider that a waste of your money to go out and do that. \u201d The approach is a risky gamble for Mr. Trump, whose victory in November came in part by assembling a coalition that included   workers who rely on many of the programs that he now proposes to slash. For now, the president and his advisers appear willing to take that risk by casting the administration as better caretakers of taxpayers\u2019 money. \u201cWe are trying to focus on both recipients of the money and the folks who give us the money in the first place,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. If the president gets his way, funding for the environment, diplomacy, housing, health services and the arts will be cut 20 to 30 percent. In 19 cases, funding will be eliminated, including for the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Military spending would increase by $54 billion, a 10 percent rise, in 2018, in addition to a $30 billion increase in the current year. White House officials said steep cuts at the State Department and increases in the military budget would refocus the United States away from helping other nations, sending a message that Mr. Trump intends to make greater use of \u201chard power\u201d around the globe. They also said the president\u2019s budget would increase resources for military veterans. Military supporters praised Mr. Trump for beginning what they believe is a needed rebuilding of the armed forces, though several key lawmakers said that even his proposed increase would not be enough for a military that they say is too small and unprepared to meet modern threats. Conservatives hailed his vision as an antidote to decades of bureaucratic growth even as they predicted fierce resistance from the interest groups and lawmakers with deep links to the affected agencies and the beneficiaries of the programs that will see their budgets slashed. \u201cThat sound you hear from Washington, D. C. this morning is the weeping and gnashing of teeth from bureaucrats and politicians who have built the federal government into an industry on the backs of taxpayers,\u201d said David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative   advocacy group. Reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal came in a flurry of angry statements on Thursday morning as various other groups began preparing their lobbying campaigns to block the president\u2019s plan in Congress. Christine Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, called the proposed cuts to the Labor Department a \u201cdraconian\u201d budget that \u201cis virtually a complete breach of faith with America\u2019s workers. \u201d Amnesty International called the cuts to foreign aid \u201cshameful\u201d and predicted \u201cglobal consequences. \u201d The Union of Concerned Scientists said cuts to scientific programs were \u201cantiquated ideas and misguided science, which will hurt our economy, kill jobs, make us less safe. \u201d The American Library Association said that eliminating federal funds for libraries was \u201ccounterproductive and shortsighted. \u201d Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said, \u201cThis budget takes a meat cleaver to public education. \u201d Environmental activists criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s priorities. Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, said that \u201cthe only thing that matters in his America is corporate polluters\u2019 profits and Wall Street billionaires. \u201d \u201cIf Trump refuses to be serious about protecting our health and climate, or our publicly owned lands, then Congress must act, do its job and reject this rigged budget,\u201d Mr. Brune said. For Mr. Trump, the complaints from nearly all quarters may serve to amplify his image as an outsider who is not beholden to the special interests in Washington. That could help the White House pressure Republican lawmakers to embrace his vision for a spending plan. But the early reaction from members of his party on Capitol Hill was muted at best, reflecting in part the discomfort among many of the party\u2019s leaders with a budget that makes no progress on tackling the growth of entitlements. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to cut $300 million from a program that aims to protect Lake Erie. \u201cI have long championed this program,\u201d Mr. Portman said, \u201cand I\u2019m committed to continuing to do everything I can to protect and preserve Lake Erie, including preserving this critical program and its funding. \u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who has long asserted a need to overhaul entitlement programs as a means to fiscal discipline for the federal government, told reporters that he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the proposed increases in military spending but said little else about the contents of the budget blueprint. Earlier in the day, Mr. Ryan issued a statement saying he was \u201cdetermined to work with the administration to shrink the size of government, grow our economy, secure our borders and ensure our troops have the tools necessary to complete their missions. \u201d He did not address any of the proposed cuts. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, called Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal \u201ca solid step toward addressing the gross overspending that is driving our national debt. \u201d He said the president should be \u201ccommended\u201d for making some tough calls. He did not pledge to support Mr. Trump\u2019s spending plan, however, adding that he looked forward to working with his congressional colleagues \u201cto craft and pass a balanced, fiscally sound budget in the coming months. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563757.6061633}
