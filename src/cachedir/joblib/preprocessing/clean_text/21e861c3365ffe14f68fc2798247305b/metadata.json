The press did all that good work ruining its reputation on its own, and we can have a long conversation about what created that. Part of it, though, is  \u2026    a lot of hysterical coverage about every little last thing that doesn\u2019t warrant it. \u201d  After Hewitt said that the \u201cmedia handwringing\u201d has gotten to be too much, Dickerson said, \u201cI agree with you, to a point. You\u2019re absolutely right. Focus on the big things. \u201d He added, \u201cI think that the problem is, the Flynn matter, and, you know, when you have a press conference like yesterday, you would have liked to have heard somebody and somewhere in the Flynn saga say, you know, he had to resign because we don\u2019t lie to the American people, and just make it  \u2014   and that\u2019s never been said. It\u2019s never been said in this whole thing about, you know, this is about giving misinformation to the American people about a not unimportant thing. And the culture of truth telling that should be a part of a White House is not  \u2014   you don\u2019t get that. You know, the President was loose about the Electoral College thing. He said that for months. Nobody stepped in to say, Mr. President, that\u2019s not right. Or they did, and it\u2019s just no big deal. So that\u2019s  \u2014   and why does that matter? You know why it matters, because little shadings end up to be a big shading at the end. \u201d Dickerson further stated, \u201cMy point is, if you\u2019re going to make a case on honesty grounds and truthfulness grounds, if that\u2019s the turf on which you\u2019re going to hold your press conference and open your press conference, so we\u2019re talking about veracity here, and the importance and necessity of that, then when it comes to veracity in your own backyard, to elide it completely, seems inconsistent with the argument that you\u2019re making in the 77 minute press conference. \u201d Hewitt then stated that people don\u2019t believe the media anymore, to which Dickerson responded, \u201cWell, yes. I mean, yes, it\u2019s true, and it\u2019s not because of anything obviously Donald Trump did. The press did all that good work ruining its reputation on its own, and we can have a long conversation about what created that. Part of it, though, is what you mentioned about the local weather report, which is to say a lot of hysterical coverage about every little last thing that doesn\u2019t warrant it. Having said that, it doesn\u2019t mean, and in fact, it most explicitly does not mean, that the press just throws out the standards. And one of the roles of the press is to make sure that the President, in the voice of the people, is telling the truth. \u201d (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742563011.8473961}
