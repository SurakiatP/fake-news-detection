Yet China has become the country that   Donald J. Trump seems to enjoy criticizing the most on his    Twitter feed. In bursts of 140 characters or less, he has jabbed at Beijing over Taiwan, trade, the South China Sea and, most recently, North Korea. \u201cChina has been taking out massive amounts of money  wealth from the U. S. in totally   trade, but won\u2019t help with North Korea. Nice!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Monday. How and when President Xi Jinping reads about these broadsides remains a mystery to outsiders. Translating Mr. Trump\u2019s sarcasm  \u2014   \u201cNice!\u201d  \u2014   could be tricky. But Chinese officials and the state news media want Mr. Trump to know that their leaders prefer doing diplomacy the   way, behind closed doors and muffled in platitudes. Xinhua, the state news agency, has more or less asked Mr. Trump to shut up. \u201cAn obsession with \u2018Twitter foreign policy\u2019 is undesirable,\u201d read the headline of  a Xinhua commentary on Tuesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s posts. \u201cEveryone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isn\u2019t child\u2019s play, and even less is it like doing business deals,\u201d said the article, published after Mr. Trump\u2019s latest barbed comments on China. \u201cTwitter shouldn\u2019t become an instrument of foreign policy,\u201d the article said. Earlier that day, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation that Beijing had coddled North Korea. But the article acknowledged that it was probably too late to detach Mr. Trump from Twitter. Mr. Trump\u2019s designated press secretary, Sean Spicer, has indicated that Mr. Trump will keep using the terse, punchy format after he settles in the White House. \u201cIssuing tweets has become a habit for Mr. Trump,\u201d Xinhua noted. Mr. Trump, it said, appeared to assume that \u201cissuing   comments and taking up sensitive issues may perhaps add to his chips for negotiating with other countries. \u201d Mr. Xi is most unlikely to joust directly with Mr. Trump on Twitter. The service has been banned in China since 2009, though residents find ways to poke through the firewall of censorship. And while Chinese politicians love slogans, they prefer to communicate with foreign leaders through long, tranquilizing disquisitions. Open sarcasm is rare. Sad!'"}, "time": 1742561900.7719088}
