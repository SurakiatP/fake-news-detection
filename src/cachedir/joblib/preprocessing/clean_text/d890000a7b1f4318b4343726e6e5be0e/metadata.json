The workers  \u2014   an employee of Flint and two state workers assigned to monitor water quality in cities  \u2014   are the first to face criminal charges in connection with the failures that left residents of this city drinking foul and unsafe water for many months. In announcing the charges, some of which are felonies carrying penalties of as much as five years in prison, Bill Schuette, the Michigan attorney general, answered skeptics in Flint and elsewhere who had openly doubted that anyone would ever be held accountable for the health crisis here. Emails and other documents have shown a cascading series of failures at every level of government  \u2014   local, state and federal  \u2014   and Mr. Schuette, a Republican who is widely seen as a possible candidate for governor in 2018, emphasized that his investigation, begun in January, was far from over. \u201cThese charges are only the beginning,\u201d Mr. Schuette said. \u201cThere will be more to come  \u2014   that I can guarantee you. \u201d The charges against the three defendants  \u2014   Michael Prysby, a district engineer with the State Department of Environmental Quality Stephen Busch, a district supervisor in the same department and Michael Glasgow, the city\u2019s utilities manager  \u2014   included tampering with evidence contained in reports on lead levels in city water, and the two state officials were also charged with conspiracy to tamper with evidence. Mr. Prysby and Mr. Busch were arraigned later on Wednesday, court records show. Lawyers for the three men could not be reached for comment. Among other things, the workers were accused of distorting the results by directing residents to run their water before it was tested and failing to collect samples from some houses they were required to test. That had the effect of making the levels of lead in the water supply appear far less dangerous than they were, and falsely reassured officials who could have intervened months earlier, as well as residents, that the water was safe. The disaster has left Flint residents fearful about the lasting effects of lead on the city\u2019s youngest children, distrustful of the promises of the authorities and reliant on filters and bottled water. Some have questioned whether this economically distressed, majority black city of fewer than 100, 000 residents will ever get justice. The charges against relatively   officials were being viewed as a promising initial step, but by no means a final answer. \u201cWe want the complete story,\u201d Karen Weaver, the recently elected mayor of Flint, said after listening to details of the charges from the front row of a news conference with prosecutors and investigators here. \u201cThis is the start to that. \u201d Some residents pointedly alluded to Gov. Rick Snyder. Asked whether Mr. Snyder would face charges, Mr. Schuette said, \u201cThere\u2019s no target, and no one\u2019s off the table. \u201d Ellis Stafford, a Flint native and an investigator on the team Mr. Schuette assigned to investigate what happened in Flint, choked up as he addressed the failed water system  \u2014   and the broken trust in government that has come from it. \u201cIt really hurts,\u201d he said. \u201cI have friends, personal close friends. They live here. They look at me and they wonder if there\u2019s any truth to this investigation. I hope I gave them some. \u201d He went on to say, \u201cI told one of my friends, \u2018You might not believe in government or the state, but believe in me. \u2019\u201d The three men face a total of 13 charges, a mix of felonies and misdemeanors. The state workers have been suspended without pay, Mr. Snyder said late Wednesday. Mr. Glasgow has been placed on administrative leave, Ms. Weaver said. The charges are linked to the handling of a change in the city\u2019s water supply two years ago and to the aftermath of that change, including a failure to add chemicals that reduce corrosion inside pipes. The resulting problems led to Flint residents\u2019 exposure to water contaminated with lead and possibly linked to a deadly outbreak of Legionnaire\u2019s disease. David M. Uhlmann, who was chief of the environmental crimes section at the Justice Department from 2000 to 2007, and who is a law professor at the University of Michigan, said such charges were rare. \u201dIt\u2019s extremely unusual and maybe unprecedented for state and local officials to be charged with criminal drinking water violations,\u201d he said. Mr. Busch and Mr. Prysby, the state officials, were charged with misconduct in office, a felony, for \u201cwillfully and knowingly misleading\u201d the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Genesee County Health Department about dangers posed by the water. Mr. Prysby was also charged with misconduct in office for authorizing use of the Flint plant, \u201cknowing that the Flint water treatment plant was deficient in its ability to provide clean and safe drinking water. \u201d Each of those charges carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10, 000 fine. Each of the tampering charges is a felony punishable by up to four years and $10, 000. Mr. Prysby and Mr. Busch each face two misdemeanor charges of violating the state\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Act by failing to order anticorrosion treatment of the water, and for telling residents to run, or \u201cpreflush,\u201d their taps before samples were taken for lead testing, creating misleadingly low readings. Each count carries a penalty of up to a year in prison, and a fine of up to $5, 000 for each day of violation. Mr. Glasgow also faces a misdemeanor charge of willful neglect of duty, with a maximum sentence of a year and a $1, 000 fine. At times, Mr. Glasgow has been seen as someone who tried to warn officials about his concerns over the water. Not long before Flint switched to a new water supply in 2014, Mr. Glasgow warned state officials that he believed the city was not fully ready to make the change and suggested, in an email  released as part of thousands of emails made public since the crisis began, that \u201cpeople above\u201d him were pushing to move too quickly. Mr. Snyder, a Republican who has apologized repeatedly for what happened in Flint but has also indicated that staff members failed for months to tell him about the gravity and dangers of the mounting situation, has faced the most intense criticism of his two terms over the issue, as well as calls for his resignation or recall. The city had switched to the troubled water system while under the control of an emergency financial manager, appointed by the governor to sort out Flint\u2019s fiscal troubles. Last month, a panel appointed by the governor assigned most of the blame to state officials, citing \u201cgovernment failure, intransigence, unpreparedness, delay, inaction and environmental injustice. \u201d Mr. Snyder, who announced this week that he would drink Flint water for a month, said at a news conference on Wednesday that the charges were \u201cdeeply troubling and extremely serious. \u201d He said he had not yet been interviewed by the attorney general\u2019s team, but that his office was cooperating with the investigation. Asked whether he believed he had committed a crime, Mr. Snyder said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. \u201d Along the streets here on Wednesday, some people questioned why Mr. Snyder was not being held to answer for the state\u2019s failings. \u201cSomebody knew about this at the top,\u201d William McCraw, 64, said as he waited at a bus station in Flint. \u201cThey need to round them all up, everyone who knew. \u201d They also wondered aloud how criminal charges could now solve their continuing water and health problems. Researchers from Virginia Tech said recently that while Flint\u2019s system was \u201con the path to recovery,\u201d it remained a \u201c  zone for lead in water. \u201d Nicole Woycik, a mother who worries about her    son\u2019s behavioral changes and wonders about   effects the water may have on him, described the criminal charges as \u201ca start. \u201d But, she added, \u201cThe charges will not bring a lot of closure, because we\u2019re affected either way. \u201d Asked whether Flint was now beginning to heal, Ms. Weaver, the mayor, said the criminal charges were \u201cpart of getting it healed. \u201d The other part, she said, would be securing all of the money Flint needs to replace its aged water system.'"}, "time": 1742563381.1814315}
