Now, the new coalition is gearing up to ask state legislators for about $11 million for Somali community initiatives, building on $2 million Gov. Mark Dayton earmarked for such projects in this year\u2019s budget. \\n\u201cWhy not combine our separate efforts and do a better collaborative effort?\u201d said Mohamud Noor, head of the Confederation of Somali Community, a coalition member. \\nSpearheaded by the Minneapolis Foundation, the initiative is also a bid to nudge Somali-American nonprofits to better track and report results. \\nA University of Southern California study last year found Somali-Americans celebrate the work of some leaders of 35 registered nonprofits and a host of more informal groups. But they distrust others. Study participants perceived some self-styled community leaders\u2013dubbed \u201cthe Pretenders\u201d\u2013as adept at applying for grants but with little to show for it. \\n{snip} \\nThis year\u2019s state budget includes $2 million for investments in the Somali community\u2013part of Dayton\u2019s package of $35 million for addressing racial disparities in Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, and the nonprofit Youthprise each received roughly half of the money, which they will distribute in grants. The department is now weighing 30 proposals worth a total of $6.7 million for its half. \\n\u201cThe $2 million wasn\u2019t even close to being sufficient,\u201d Warfa said. \u201cWe are asking for more money.\u201d \\nWeli says the group also wants to push the state to entrust Somali-led nonprofits with funds directly, rather than steering resources to state agencies. \\n\u201cThe system is not structured so that people of color serve themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are always the recipients of services.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nThe group is calling for investments to encourage entrepreneurship and homeownership, expand mental health services, provide culturally sensitive prenatal care and spur youth leadership. \\nA more specific proposal is still a work in progress, leaders acknowledge. \\n{snip} \\nMohamed Ahmed, a creator of cartoons lampooning extremists, who is not part of the coalition, says many in the community feel acute mistrust of local nonprofits and community leaders. \\n\u201cYou can literally throw a stone and hit a nonprofit in the community; there are so many of them, God help us,\u201d said Ahmed, whose Average Mohamed initiative recently became a nonprofit as well. \u201cAccountability and monitoring effectiveness are big issues.\u201d \\nAhmed says Warfa is well-respected, and a group of nonprofits that will hold each other accountable is a promising step. \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742563387.6109052}
