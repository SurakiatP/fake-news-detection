{"duration": 0.03176474571228027, "input_args": {"text": "'In an interview with CNN on Wednesday night, Thomas Barrack Jr. who heads the Presidential Inaugural Committee, was asked whether Kanye West, who vocally supported Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy last year, and who visited him in Trump Tower in December following his victory, would be performing at any of the inaugural events. \u201cWe haven\u2019t asked him,\u201d Mr. Barrack replied. Rather than stop there, he continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not the venue. The venue we have for entertainment is filled out. It\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s going to be typically and traditionally American. \u201d Following a political season in which quarrels over inclusion and exclusion in the United States  \u2014   in senses literal, metaphorical and philosophical  \u2014   were central and heated, the \u201cMake America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\u201d was an opportunity to make a loud case. The stage was a potent one: the National Mall in Washington, just beneath the Lincoln Memorial. The concert was broadcast live on CNN and online. What was presented as \u201ctypically and traditionally American,\u201d however, veered between jingoism and vaudevillian fluff and largely ignored the contribution of   to popular music (which is to say, almost all of popular music). Instead it focused heavily on country and rock by white Southerners, including the country superstar Toby Keith, who has been the nation\u2019s loudest musical cheerleader for a decade and a half the Mississippi   band 3 Doors Down, which was a favorite in the    2000s and the Frontmen of Country, an amalgam of   singers made famous in other bands. It was a spotty lineup, though not a wholly ineffective one. 3 Doors Down\u2019s songs remain sturdy, and the frontman Brad Arnold\u2019s voice was strong, though denuded of its sleazy edges. And Mr. Keith, the headliner, in a heavy overcoat and a scruffy beard, delivered potent patriotism via strong narratives. Mr. Keith isn\u2019t as uncomplicated a choice as he might appear from a distance. In the past, he\u2019s been a registered Democrat, and here, he thanked President Obama for his service before offering a salute to Mr. Trump. Mr. Keith\u2019s career soared after   when his music took an aggressive turn. At this show, he played the pugnacious and proud \u201cCourtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American),\u201d and also \u201cAmerican Soldier,\u201d a meditative embrace of patriotic dedication. He also played \u201cBeer for My Horses,\u201d with its    endorsement of   vigilante justice: \u201cTake all the rope in Texas, find a tall oak   up all them bad boys, hang them high in the   all the people to see. \u201d Mr. Keith\u2019s songs about America are very conscious of place, and at this show, that proved an effective strategy. The Frontmen of Country leaned heavily on songs that mentioned bucolic Southern settings: \u201cGod Blessed Texas,\u201d \u201cAmy\u2019s Back in Austin,\u201d \u201cWalking in Memphis. \u201d And Lee Greenwood joined them for \u201cGod Bless the U. S. A. ,\u201d a dour march of national pride. In total, the concert\u2019s message was that America is a defined geographical and ideological space, with borders worth defending, even at the price of excluding those who could make the place immeasurably more fun. This concert ended up being as notable for who did not show up as for who did. The only featured nonwhite performers were Sam Moore (of the 1960s soul duo Sam  Dave) who sang a restrained \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d backed by an   choir, and DJ Ravidrums, who delivered his dim, caffeinated percussive interstitials from inside a spherical   drum kit. But both of those acts got just a couple of minutes. The United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps got much more time for their    songs. When Mr. Trump first appeared onstage at the show, accompanied by his wife, Melania, it was to the Rolling Stones\u2019s \u201cHeart of Stone,\u201d a song about a man who can\u2019t be swayed. At the end of the concert, Mr. Trump addressed the crowd briefly, thanked the performers, and suggested that hosting this event in front of the Lincoln Memorial might have been an unprecedented choice. That was not true. In 2009, Mr. Obama held a   concert here, \u201cWe Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. \u201d It included athletes, actors and musicians from across genres  \u2014   Mary J. Blige singing Bill Withers\u2019s \u201cLean on Me,\u201d Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen singing \u201cThis Land Is Your Land,\u201d a song of acceptance and respect for the nation. It was a show of cosmopolitanism and inclusion that portrayed America not as a fixed idea, but as an   sum.'"}, "time": 1742628560.025561}
