[Trump tweeted:  ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017,  \u201cObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. The House pulled the American Health Care Act from the House floor Friday after it became clear that the House was not able to secure enough votes for the bill\u2019s passage. Trump told the media Friday afternoon that the bill\u2019s failure would help Congress put together a better healthcare plan, but he also blamed the Democrats for opposing the bill. \u201cCertainly for me it was a very interesting experience, but for me, it\u2019ll be an experience that leads to an even better healthcare plan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe were very close. It was a very tight margin. We had no Democrat support, no votes from the Democrats,\u201d he added. Trump specifically singled out House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as the reason for the bill\u2019s failure. \u201cThe losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because they own Obamacare. They 100% own it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have Obamacare for a little while longer until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future. \u201d Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said Friday that the failure of the Obamacare replacement bill will make tax reform harder but not \u201cimpossible\u201d after the White House sent a message that President Trump\u2019s tax reform and infrastructure agenda will not be affected by the failed healthcare bill.'"}, "time": 1742628592.982125}
