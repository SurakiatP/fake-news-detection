They should not take part in activities that endanger his/her professional integrity.The professional status of the journalist is not compatible with occupying a position in state bodies, or in the headquarters of political parties and other political organizations. If work in political parties causes conflict of interests, raises or may raise the question of objectivity of mass media, it is not acceptable. Conflicts of interests damage the prestige of mass media.\u201d \\nThat being said, award winning journalist and The Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington sought a \u2018useful\u2019 role in the Democratic party, and pledged to use HuffPost to \u2018Echo [the DNC\u2019s] Message\u2019.\\nThe part-time media tycoon and full-time socialite sought to play a \u201cuseful\u201d role within the Democratic Party establishment by using her website to quote \u201cecho\u201d the party message, according to emails published by WikiLeaks.\\n\\nIn an April 2008 email to top Democratic operatives, including Paul Begala, Stan Greenberg, David Brock, and current Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Democratic operative Susan McCue relayed a discussion she had with Huffington about advancing the Democratic cause in an official capacity.\\nHuffington, explained McCue, suggested that she would be more comfortable in a role of covert influence, and \u201cusing Huffpo to echo our message.\u201d The media tycoon \u201chas a point,\u201d McCue conceded.\\nBack in October a HuffPo writer by the name of David Seamen went public that HuffPo and Arianna, was editing and censoring his material. https://youtu.be/hIcImy1MKuc Funny thing is that just prior to David going public the DNC held an \u201cOff-the-Record\u201d party for main stream reporters, news anchors, and editors. Guccifer 2.0 provided The Intercept with emails revealing \u201cfriendly and highly useful relationships\u201d between the Clinton campaign and the U.S. media. Those emails showed that the Clinton campaign held a private, \u201coff-the-record\u201d dinner with \u201cinfluential reporters, anchors and editors\u201d No wonder only 6 percent of Americans trust the media. Here is the full list of RSVPs:\\n\\nBack in 2011, Huffington praised Wikileaks, saying: \u201cIf I ruled the world, my first goal would be to make it easier to cut through to the facts. At the moment, we are all drowning in spin, smokescreens and lies. Those who perpetrated the two biggest policy disasters of the past ten years\u2014the Iraq war and the financial crisis\u2014could not have pulled their work off without a lack of transparency. So greater transparency would be at the top of my agenda..The internet has already shown great promise in cutting through spin. YouTube, Twitter, email, and turbocharged search engines have made it easier to expose our leaders\u2019 distortions. But if I were in charge, I\u2019d go much further to protect the rights of disclosure and free speech on the internet, and challenge the press\u2014particularly in America\u2014to break its addiction to faux objectivity.\u201d\\nIn the video below Arianna Huffington, founder of The Huffington Post, gets confronted by Luke Rudkowski of WeAreChange about censoring Jesse Ventura\u2019s 9/11 article.\\nhttps://youtu.be/J-5JgDG7HcY The post Arianna Huffington Exposed Colluding With DNC in New WikiLeaks Emails appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742562788.4158666}
