[The UK Independence Party (UKIP) manifesto  \u2014   a   document covering a vast swathe of international and domestic policy positions for the upcoming General Election  \u2014   was due to be launched on Tuesday. The party delayed the launch out of respect for the victims of the Manchester attack.  That didn\u2019t stop the traditionally   media accusing the party of \u201cexploiting\u201d the attack simply for urging strength in the face of extremism and terrorism: something every other party leader has already done since the atrocity on Monday night. Channel 4\u2019s Michael Crick opened by asking: \u201c  \u2026    wasn\u2019t that blatantly exploiting Manchester for election and party purposes?\u201d UKIP supporters in the crowd hit back, shouting \u201cRubbish!\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re exploiting it!\u201d at Mr. Crick. Indeed, UKIP\u2019s manifesto was finalised and went to print last Saturday, and was not changed since the Manchester attack. ITV\u2019s Libby Wiener insisted: \u201cYou say you\u2019re not exploiting Manchester but you say also that lighting candles isn\u2019t enough. Isn\u2019t that an insult to all the people who have come out in Manchester to show their respects?\u201d She was followed by Channel 5\u2019s Andy Bell, who rather than asking about policies in the manifesto, asked: \u201cCan you confirm that you haven\u2019t added anything in to your manifesto since what happened on Monday night?\u201d The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg chimed in, appearing to act as a Conservative Party surrogate: \u201cI understand you had very strong words for Theresa May\u2019s record as Home Secretary. You\u2019ve accused her of allowing jihadis in. It sounds like you\u2019re near as damn blaming the Prime Minister for this attack and the circumstances that led to it. \u201d Finally, LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood issued a statement, rather than asking a question: \u201cPaul, you had a choice yesterday afternoon when [the] minute\u2019s silence was announced. You could have put back this manifesto launch to 12 o\u2019clock  \u2026     instead in 10 minutes time the nations is going to stop to remember the victims. Surely you\u2019re exploiting what happened in Manchester. \u201d In fact, it was broadcast producers who asked for the launch to be earlier in the day so they could film, edit, and package clips together for the news channels. WATCH:  Reporters were heckled at @UKIP\u2019s manifesto launch when they quizzed @paulnuttallukip over his comments about the Manchester terror attack. pic. twitter.   \u2014   BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) May 25, 2017,  In effect, what the partisan press was asking UKIP, is \u201chow do you dare talk of solving this problem?\u201d Sadly, Paul Nuttall\u2019s responses were not as robust as mine would have been i. e.: \u201cYes I am blaming the Prime Minister and decades of Labour and Conservative policy on immigration, security, defence, policing, and foreign policy for this attack. \u201d Nonetheless, when we ask ourselves why we can\u2019t seem to get a grip of these atrocities, consider the attacks people and parties who try and offer solutions endure at the hands of Crick, Wiener, Bell, Kuenssberg, Usherwood, and their liberal friends.
