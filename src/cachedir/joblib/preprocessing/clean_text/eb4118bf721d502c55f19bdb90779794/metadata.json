[The animal rights campaigner tweeted to her followers that they should not vote Macron, fearing the situation for animals would deteriorate under his presidency.  \u201cThe contempt he gives to animal suffering can be seen in the total lack of empathy reflected in the coldness of his steel eyes. \u201cWhilst the scandals are increasing, he takes the side of the animal breeders and the hunters against animal rights associations that are fighting with the lobbies that seem to have power over this candidate. \u201d One of the   sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s, Bardot came out as a supporter of populist candidate Marine Le Pen at the beginning of the year. In a   interview with Le Figaro that touched upon cultural issues, Ms. Bardot was asked what she thought of contemporary culture. \u201cWe live in a period when everything is vulgar, ordinary, and mediocre,\u201d Bardot said. \u201cFrance no longer has the radiance, the majesty it had. \u201d When asked if she was close to Le Pen\u2019s   migration party, the Front National, the actress responded: \u201cI am very patriotic. I was raised by a father and a grandfather who fought for France and instilled in me a love of my homeland. I am not proud of what France is today  \u2026     I\u2019m not a \u2018facho\u2019 [fascist] any more than Marine Le Pen is. \u201d \u201cMarine Le Pen has the will to take France in hand, to restore borders and give priority to the French. \u201d Acknowledged as a symbol of woman\u2019s liberation, Bardot told Le Figaro she was against the Muslim face veil. \u201cCommunitarianism takes on too much importance. It is the culmination of thirty years of laxity. \u201d She is also a vocal opponent of Muslim halal slaughter, which often involves slaughtering an animal without stunning it, causing pain and distress before death. Regarded as a free speech activist, the    actress has faced trial five times between 1997 and 2008 for \u201cinciting racial hatred\u201d including for comments criticising mass Muslim immigration in France. On one of these occasions, she was convicted for \u201cdecrying the loss of French identity and tradition due to the \u2018multiplication of mosques while our church bells fall silent for want of priests\u2019\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742562586.0277429}
