These politicians believe they can get away with such actions because they trust that they can count on a complicit mainstream media to cover for their corruption. \\nA case in point is the funding McAuliffe arranged for Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of the future deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe. McAuliffe steered nearly $500,000 from his political action committee, Common Good VA, and another approximately $200,000 from the Virginia Democratic Party to Mrs. McCabe for her state senate campaign in 2015. Her campaign had a total budget of $1.8 million, and according to The Washington Post, in 2015 the state allowed candidates to use campaign funds for personal expenses so long as the campaign was operating. \\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not at all a normal amount [of money],\u201d said State Senator Dick Black, the incumbent who defeated McCabe in 2015 and kept the seat, on the Steve Batton Show . \u201cIn fact, the amount that was involved is comparable to what you would have in a full congressional, a hotly contested congressional race.\u201d Black, who served as a pilot for the Marines during the Vietnam War, was later the head of the Criminal Law Division at the Pentagon. \\n\u201cThe amount of money that was put in was astounding,\u201d Black continued. \u201cIt was four times as much as the Democrats had put into the former race when this was an open seat.\u201d At the time that Jill McCabe announced her campaign, her husband Andrew was running the Washington, D.C. field office of the FBI. He was later promoted to the number three position, and then promoted to deputy director. His wife\u2019s campaign failed, and, according to The Washington Post, Andrew McCabe avoided handling Virginia public corruption cases during her campaign and didn\u2019t \u201cparticipate in\u201d campaign events. \\nYet, given that the main funder of his wife\u2019s campaign, Governor McAuliffe, is a long-time Clinton ally who chaired Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and chaired the Democratic National Committee, Andrew McCabe should have recused himself from the Hillary Clinton investigation\u2014no matter at what level he was serving. \\nAccording to a cutting Wall Street Journal editorial , \u201cAll of this asks voters to believe that Mr. McCabe as the No. 3 official at the FBI had nothing to do with the biggest, most sensitive case at that agency. This strains credulity.\u201d It was the Journal that broke the story this week about McAuliffe steering money to McCabe. \\nThe editorial continues, \u201cBefore he became No. 3 at the FBI Mr. McCabe ran the bureau\u2019s Washington, D.C. field office that provided resources to the Clinton probe. Campaign-finance records show that 98% of the McAuliffe donations to Mrs. McCabe came after the FBI launched its Clinton probe.\u201d \\nThree months after McCabe\u2019s defeat, her husband became the FBI deputy director helping to oversee the Clinton email case. Not only does this have the appearance of impropriety\u2014it doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. \\n\u201cSo the Democratic Party actually suspected that this woman was a Republican because she hadn\u2019t been active in any politics,\u201d said Black. \u201cShe came out of the blue, which was quite mysterious. Why this woman, why was she chosen?\u201d Black described how another Democratic Party operative had already filed to run for the state senate seat, but the party decided that Jill McCabe would be the candidate\u2014without holding a primary. \\nAs we have reported, the whole FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of classified email and private server stinks\u2014and the fix was clearly in . Not only did the FBI grant immunity to five people deeply involved in the case, it also made a deal to destroy evidence on two witnesses\u2019 computers once it finished reviewing material found on them. \u201cSources said the arrangement with former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills and ex-campaign staffer Heather Samuelson also limited the search to no later than Jan. 31, 2015,\u201d reported Fox News. \u201cThis meant investigators could not review documents for the period after the email server became public\u2014in turn preventing the bureau from discovering if there was any evidence of obstruction of justice, sources said.\u201d \\nIn addition, the FBI failed to empanel a grand jury to look into the case, instead relying on non-aggressive interviews which were not recorded. \\nWe have long maintained that EmailGate is not just about hiding information from the public, but is also a national security scandal. The Obama administration is clearly using political considerations to determine who receives punishment for mishandling the nation\u2019s secrets. Among the latest WikiLeaks revelations is further proof that President Obama was well aware that Mrs. Clinton was doing government business from a private, unsecured server, though he denied it, and that staff members were scrambling to figure out how to contain the fallout. \\nThe Washington Post reports that another government official who mishandled classified information, leaking it to the press, failed to escape judgment. Former Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman General James E. Cartwright\u2019s \u201cgreatest mistake was not talking to reporters or lying about it; he failed to play the Washington game skillfully enough to avoid becoming a scapegoat for a system in which senior officials skirt the rules and then fall back on their political power to save them,\u201d writes Josh Rogin for the Post. He describes how Cartwright \u201cwas a pariah to many of the Very Important People in Washington\u2019s national security elite.\u201d \\nCartwright \u201cpleaded guilty to the felony charge of lying to the FBI during its investigation into the leaking of classified information about covert operations against Iran to two journalists\u201d and could face up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine, writes Rogin. \\nBefore that, Cartwright was known as \u201c Obama\u2019s favorite general .\u201d But clearly that is no longer the case, or presumably he would have gotten off scot-free, just like Hillary, from the highly politicized Obama Justice Department. Hillary\u2019s mishandling of classified material was part of her daily routine for years\u2014far more egregious than anything that Cartwright did. \\nAs Rogin pointed out in the Post article, Cartwright spoke to The New York Times\u2019 David Sanger about the Stuxnet program designed to slow down Iran\u2019s quest for nuclear weapons. Sanger had previously \u201chad meetings on Iran with several other high-profile administration officials, including National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns and even Clinton herself. There\u2019s no evidence of any other Stuxnet leak investigations of high-level officials.\u201d \\nBut only Cartwright is taking the fall. \u201cIn his statement taking responsibility for lying to the FBI,\u201d writes Rogin, \u201cCartwright asserted his motivations were patriotic. \u2018My only goal in talking to the reporters was to protect American interests and lives; I love my country and continue to this day to do everything I can to defend it.\u2019\u201d We may have to wait for Cartwright\u2019s memoir to find out the rest of this story. \\nIn 2013, the Times\u2019 Sanger said that the Obama administration was the \u201cmost closed, control-freak administration\u201d he\u2019d ever covered. But Hillary got a pass, in order to run for the White House to succeed President Obama. We have reported on how this administration has systematically and to an unprecedented level targeted leakers and journalists . \\nBut the whitewash of an FBI investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices is looking more and more like a cover-up. That the McCabes felt indebted to Clinton associate McAuliffe cannot be definitively proven, but it defies common sense to assume that they both were purely impartial about the investigation into Hillary. If only the mainstream media would do their job and report on the facts of this case, instead of simply lambasting Donald Trump and his supporters for his inartful comments. If only.
