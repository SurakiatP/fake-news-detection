[The Stratford Observer reports that Lee Skinner was running along the canal side near Yardley Road, Acocks Green in the middle of the afternoon when one of the   group suddenly struck him full force in the face, knocking him into the icy waters.  The Daily Mirror records how Skinner was \u201cable to identify them as Pakistani as I\u2019ve worked in Muslim communities and have a detailed knowledge of Islam and speak Arabic to a certain level\u201d. The   lecturer described how the blow sent him \u201cup into the air and into the water. I sank and was completely submerged, my feet were not touching the bottom. \u201d Skinner was not knocked completely unconscious and drowned, fortunately, but a police spokesman said he was \u201cprevented from getting out by his assailant\u201d. Only after the   linguist cried out \u201cThere is no God but Allah\u201d in Arabic did his attackers panic and flee the scene, possibly suspecting they may have assaulted a fellow Muslim. He was then able to heave himself out of the frigid waters, but cut his legs badly while doing so. Skinner caught up to four of the group, though not his principal aggressor, who told him \u201cthe attack happened because I was white\u201d. The 38   then warned group \u201cthat in the current political climate, such actions could have a negative effect on the Muslim Pakistani community\u201d and lectured them on \u201cthe positive aspects of Mohammed and Islam\u201d. Skinner lost his phone, keys, glasses and a memory stick where his college lessons were saved, and had to be treated in hospital for damage to his cheekbone, teeth and neck muscles.
