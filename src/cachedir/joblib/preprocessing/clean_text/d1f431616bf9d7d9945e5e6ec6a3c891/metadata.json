[In a resignation letter sent to fellow choir members and later posted on Facebook, singer Jan Chamberlin said she\u2019d spent \u201cseveral sleepless nights and days in turmoil and agony\u201d since the choir announced it would perform at the inauguration, and that she could not \u201cin good conscience\u201d join her colleagues at the event.  \u201cI have highly valued the mission of the Choir to be   will ambassadors for Christ, to share beautiful music and to give hope, inspiration, and comfort to others,\u201d Chamberlin wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to tell myself that it will be alright and that I can continue in good conscience before God and man. \u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s no use,\u201d she added. \u201cI simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events. I could never look myself in the mirror again with self respect. \u201d The Mormon Tabernacle Choir  \u2014   dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Choir\u201d by President Ronald Reagan at his inauguration in 1981  \u2014   has performed at the inaugurations of numerous presidents throughout history, including those for Lyndon B. Johnson, Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush. But since the announcement that it would perform at Trump\u2019s inauguration, the choir has been the subject of a petition seeking to persuade the group to cancel its performance that has since gathered thousands of signatures. \u201cAs members and friends of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, we strongly urge the Church to stop this practice and especially for an incoming president who has demonstrated sexist, racist, misogynistic, and xenophobic behavior that does not align with the principles and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints,\u201d the petition, which has garnered more than 23, 000 signatures, states. In her resignation letter, Chamberlin wrote that by preforming for Trump\u2019s inauguration, it would appear to those outside the choir that the group is \u201cendorsing tyranny and fascism. \u201d \u201cAnd Choir\u2019s wonderful image and networking will be severely damaged and that many good people throughout this land and throughout the world already do and will continue to feel betrayed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI believe hereafter our message will not be believed by many that have loved us and adored what we have stood for. \u201d The Mormon Tabernacle Choir will join the Radio City Rockettes at the inauguration, while teenage opera singer Jackie Evancho is slated to perform the National Anthem.
