But they are also preparing to retaliate. If Britons do vote in a referendum on Thursday to leave the European Union, they can expect a tough and unforgiving response, with capitals across the Continent intent on deterring other countries from following the British example, European officials and analysts said. In other words, Britain will be made to suffer for its choice. With other issues pressing, including Greek debt, the migrant crisis and terrorism, the largest and most powerful European nations will want clarity, and are not likely to tolerate a long period of   confusion. \u201cIn is in  \u2014   out is out,\u201d the powerful German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, told Spiegel magazine. \u201cI hope and believe that the British will ultimately decide against Brexit. The withdrawal of Britain would be a heavy loss for Europe. \u201d The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, spoke apocalyptically about a British exit, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d to the German tabloid Bild. He said all members of the European Union would suffer, as would the postwar structure of Europe that had kept the peace. \u201cWhy is it so dangerous?\u201d Mr. Tusk asked. \u201cNo one can foresee what the   consequences would be. As a historian, I fear that Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the E. U. but also of Western political civilization. \u201d Britain would face at least seven years of limbo during painful negotiations about a new relationship with the bloc, Mr. Tusk said. Preparing for a British vote to withdraw, France and Germany are debating the immediate announcement of a joint initiative on European security, perhaps an operational command headquarters, to show, at least symbolically, that the European Union remains solid and will continue to progress without Britain. But Germany has rejected some ideas from the European Commission, the permanent bureaucracy in Brussels, to respond by moving quickly toward more European political or fiscal integration, understanding that with Spanish elections this month and French and German elections next year, \u201cmore Europe\u201d is not what voters want. And no government wants treaty change, which would prompt more referendums at a time when populist,   sentiments are running strong across the Continent. Suggestions by British politicians favoring a departure that the rest of the European Union will give Britain more favorable terms in a new trading arrangement will be rejected out of hand by European leaders, who do not want to make further concessions to a country that has rejected them, officials said. This would ensure that the British example discouraged others tempted to seek a special deal for themselves. To that end, the main European Union nations are envisioning a   negotiating process for a British exit, once the British government invokes Article 50 of the treaty governing membership in the bloc. Article 50 provides two years to haggle over the terms of a divorce from the bloc  \u2014   something that has never happened. The European Union is expected to want to talk about a future trade agreement only after Britain and the other 27 nations in the bloc have made a decision about how to unwind British membership. That process would require resolving complex legal and financial issues and addressing all kinds of topics that would affect ordinary people  \u2014   what happens to pensions and health coverage, as well as the immigration status of European citizens working and living in Britain, and that of British citizens in the bloc. Officials want to negotiate future trade and financial services arrangements with Britain as a nonmember they do not want to allow Britain to use the status of European citizens in Britain and their rights as a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations, which could take several years to conclude, beyond the   time limit for exit talks. Even then, Brussels would offer Britain one of the three existing models of varying closeness and mutual obligation  \u2014   the bloc\u2019s arrangements with Norway, Canada and the World Trade Organization  \u2014   rather than offer to negotiate something new, said Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, a London research institution. France and Belgium, and probably Germany, are almost certain to reject any British proposal to remain within the European single market  \u2014   even, or especially, for financial services  \u2014   without at least an agreement that Britain continue to allow European citizens to live and work in Britain, analysts and officials said. In any case, such a   the   Norway model, is strongly opposed by British advocates of withdrawing from the bloc, in the name of controlling immigration. \u201cThere is no appetite to be nice on the day after,\u201d said Camille Grand, the director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in France. \u201cWhatever the British say or feel, there will be a price to pay, if only to prevent further attempts to exit the E. U. \u201d The French message, Mr. Grand said, is like Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s: \u201cIf you leave, you leave. And we won\u2019t grant you the benefits of the single market. You won\u2019t move to an \u00e0 la carte membership. \u201d The Germans and the Dutch, Mr. Grand said, \u201cmight be tempted to be more flexible, but in Paris, it\u2019s a divorce, and we must be tough with the British to prevent the Czechs or whomever from trying to make their own deals. \u201d But it may be the political aspect of a British exit that worries Europeans the most, coupled with the expected financial shock, said Guntram Wolff, the director of Bruegel, an independent research institution in Brussels. \u201cPopulists throughout Europe will celebrate this as a \u2018feast of democracy,\u2019 where finally the citizens get their say over the elites,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cPopulists all over Europe will gain in strength. And markets could react by saying, \u2018The first brick is out of the wall, and now let\u2019s bet on another brick. \u2019\u201d The next brick, Mr. Wolff said, could be economically troubled Italy, and that \u201ccould set in motion a domino effect,\u201d with the euro dropping sharply in value along with the pound. So the European Central Bank would have to be prepared to prop up the banks and the euro against market pressure, just as the Bank of England would have to prop up the pound. No one in Germany thinks it would be good if the British left, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the Europe program at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. \u201cIf the European Union is not able to prove that membership is worth having, and that in the end emotion wins over rational debates, this not only tells you something about public sentiment in Britain, but will have a contagion effect in other nations,\u201d she said. Added to European instability, Ms. Schwarzer said, the immediate economic shock could badly damage countries with high debt, like France, Italy and Greece. Even if the British vote to remain, \u201cthis Europe of multiple speeds may continue to disintegrate,\u201d said Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s economy minister. \u201cBut if the U. K. leaves, we will have this risk squared. Are we capable of keeping the founding promises that led to the union\u2019s creation  \u2014   peace, prosperity, freedom?\u201d The effect on the bloc of a British departure would be threefold, Mr. Grant said. First, he said, a British withdrawal would be a big boost to nationalist,   Union movements, with Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s   National Front, already comparing a British exit to the fall of the Berlin Wall. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the right will win power, but they\u2019ll feel they have history with them, and   elites in government will be on the back foot and afraid of moves toward more integration,\u201d Mr. Grant said. \u201cFederalism would be dead, and there would be no more referendums and treaty changes for generations, so it would be a new period of national power and not the federal future the European Commission wants. \u201d Second, he said, without the counterweight of Britain, \u201cthe German problem becomes more acute. \u201d Rome, Paris and Warsaw fear that without Britain as a countervailing force in the bloc, Germany would become too powerful. The Germans themselves fear that an   alliance would form. Third, he said, the European Union without Britain\u2019s   influence would be more French in its economic policy outlook and more protectionist, with little impetus for   deals or for the extension of the single market to services. \u201cThe stakes are high, because what happens in Britain will set off a domino effect and possibly a cycle of disintegration,\u201d said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe European Union would look like a broken project, a declining power. \u201d Radoslaw Sikorski, a former Polish foreign minister, said a British departure from the bloc might have some benefits for those who want the nations of Europe to continue drawing closer. \u201cEurope could forge ahead with a common security policy, which the British have vetoed repeatedly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the countries of the eurozone would probably insist on all euro trade being moved out of Britain,\u201d which could help efforts by Paris, Frankfurt and Luxembourg to establish themselves as more important financial centers relative to London. But over all, Mr. Sikorski said, \u201cthe European Union is much better with Britain in it, providing liberal politics, liberal economics and a center of democratic political consensus of a kind needed now in Europe. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628434.7887135}
