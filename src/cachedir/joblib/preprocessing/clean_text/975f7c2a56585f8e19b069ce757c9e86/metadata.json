[The President entertained an opinion many people hold about the NFL chief, according to The New York Times. Trump\u2019s quotes appear in yet another article attacking Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick, and Patriots owner Robert Kraft for their support and friendship with the President.  The Times unearthed comments from 2015 where Trump called Goodell a \u201cdope\u201d and a \u201cstupid guy,\u201d especially for how he handled Ray Rice\u2019s domestic violence charges and Tom Brady\u2019s \u201cDeflategate\u201d incident. \u201cThe commissioner is a weak guy,\u201d Trump reportedly said of Goodell. \u201cWhen he made the Ray Rice deal, everybody said: You\u2019re stupid. You\u2019re weak. And it was such a weak deal. So now he\u2019s going overboard with their star, Brady. \u201d Trump\u2019s opinion of Goodell is not all that unusual and reflects that of many NFL fans. The NFL commissioner earned a low 19 percent favorable rating with a corresponding 40 percent unfavorable rating from fans. His job approval rating comes in at 28 percent, 19 points less than the mark Americans give President Barack Obama late last year.
