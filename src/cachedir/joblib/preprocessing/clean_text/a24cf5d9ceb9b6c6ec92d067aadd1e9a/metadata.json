Thousands of protesters are expected in the city when the Republican Party holds its convention here from July  . Groups opposed to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, and those supporting him, are planning big rallies. City officials cited security concerns in arguing for restrictions on the demonstrators. The changes agreed to by city officials will most likely increase the visibility of the demonstrations and other activities along the city\u2019s parade route, said Stephen David, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, which sued the city over its original rules. The changes also extend the deadline to apply for permits to hold an event, Mr. David said. A federal judge ruled last week that Cleveland\u2019s original regulations for demonstrations and marches during the convention infringed on the right of free expression and ordered city officials and the A. C. L. U. to negotiate new rules. The new rules, completed Wednesday by the Cleveland Board of Control, extend the parade route, which is the area where demonstrators are permitted to march. They allow protests to go through parts of downtown Cleveland to give some larger groups more time to demonstrate, he said. \u201cPeople will have more opportunities to be seen by delegates especially with the new parade route,\u201d Mr. David said. \u201cThese regulations are a significant improvement from what we had seen before. \u201d Despite the rules changes, the demonstrators will not pass directly by the Quicken Loans Arena, which is where the nominating convention will take place. But they will now be able to march through areas around the arena that were previously off limits, including some public parks. The changes also added buffer times between demonstrations, after some feared that groups supporting Mr. Trump might clash with those opposing him. \u201cThe R. N. C. offers a unique stage to groups from all sides of the political spectrum to lift their voices to a national audience,\u201d Christine Link, executive director for the A. C. L. U. of Ohio, said in a statement. \u201cThe new rules ensure that people have meaningful opportunities to express themselves on some of our most important national issues. \u201d Law enforcement officials said they expected thousands of protesters to show up on the first day of the convention, a Monday, with dozens of groups, ranging from Black Lives Matter to Citizens for Trump, likely to turn out. The rule changes were welcomed by Judge Ronald B. Adrine of Cleveland\u2019s municipal court. He will be one of several judges working during the convention on cases involving people arrested at demonstrations. He said the new parade route and expanded duration of the protests would make it less likely that people will get into confrontations with the authorities. \u201cI think that the more people are able to do what they want to do or say what they want to say the better,\u201d he said, since \u201cthey don\u2019t necessarily have to take issue with the police,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the degree that the police can just stand back and let them throw their tantrum  \u2014   all good as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he added. The legal skirmishing recalls past battles over convention demonstrations like one in St. Paul in 2008, when protest groups sued before the Republican convention over a parade route and strict rules for permits.'"}, "time": 1742563315.1469953}
