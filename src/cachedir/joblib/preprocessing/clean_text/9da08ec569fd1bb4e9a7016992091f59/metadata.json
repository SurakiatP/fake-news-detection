C.  \u2014   Standing in front of a host of Republican House lawmakers gathered for a victory lap in the Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump declared that passing the American Health Care Act would be an \u201cunbelievable victory when we get it through the Senate. \u201d[After weeks of heated debate over repealing and replacing Obamacare, the House very narrowly passed what the Vice President called the first step in repealing President Obama\u2019s signature health insurance law, Obamacare. President Trump called a press conference with House Republicans at the White House to commemorate the   passage of the bill.

Pence recalled the March 2010 passage of Obamacare and Republican promises that the law \u201cwould not stand\u201d as he stood in front of an overflowing crowd of Republican lawmakers who had rushed down to the White House from Capitol Hill. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a historic first step to repeal and replace Obamacare and finally give the American people the kind of health care they deserve. \u201d President Trump spoke of Americans suffering under the \u201cravages\u201d of Obamacare. He declared confidence that the bill would pass in the U. S. Senate, that it would \u201cget even better. \u201d He promised that premiums and deductibles will come down under the AHCA. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be an unbelievable victory, actually, when we get it through the Senate,\u201d said Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan said that, after serving during four presidential administrations, he had never seen the level of involvement from the White House as he has with this President and Vice President. As Ryan spoke, Trump and Rep. Mark Meadows could be seen leaning in for a few friendly words that seemed to make each of them smile. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy then took the podium, stating that it would have been easy to watch Obamacare collapse, but that wouldn\u2019t be right, \u201cToday is a start of a new beginning. \u201d House Majority Whip Steve Scalise spoke of stories from Americans in his district who have seen double digit increases in their health insurance premiums every year under Obamacare. This isn\u2019t about a political goal, said Scalise, this is \u201cabout families. \u201d Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden said they reached out to Governors, Insurance Commissioners, and \u201cinnovators of this space. \u201d \u201cWe have the opportunity now to rescue people, to give them the opportunity to truly get the kind of care that they want, they deserve, with the doctors that they choose, and a price they can afford,\u201d said House Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said, \u201cI know this is just a first step, but make no mistake, this is a giant step toward the day when Americans aren\u2019t struggling under one trillion of dollars of tax hikes that hurt small businesses, that land on families, that drag our economy down, that hurt patients. \u201d Brady thanked Congressman Mark Meadows for remaining \u201cat the table, worked to bring our conference together. \u201d Freedom Caucus Chairman Meadows then took to the podium saying, \u201cThere are three numbers that matter today, 217, 1, and 318. \u201d Meadows continued: Today we had a vote in the House and 217 votes actually came together from different districts, from all across the country. From Maine to California, from Michigan to Florida and in between and all of those 217 members came from different districts that represented a different kind of people. It\u2019s a good day because of the number one, a president who wouldn\u2019t give up, a president who got engaged, a president who said you know I don\u2019t care what the mainstream media is saying, we\u2019re gonna get this done and we\u2019re gonna make it better for the American people. And Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for those late night calls i\u2019m glad that i\u2019ll get some rest, but I want to thank you on behalf of the most critical number and that\u2019s the 318 million Americans who now, once again will be able to get affordable healthcare, to allow those decisions to be made between them and their doctor and once again, make sure that they don\u2019t have to go begging and figuring out how to pay for their healthcare premium instead of their mortgage. So Mr. President it\u2019s a great day for America, it\u2019s a great day for this Administration and it\u2019s a truly great day for the American people.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Director Seema Verma took the podium thanking the whole group and speaking of moms across the country with insurance cards they can\u2019t use because their healthcare was unaffordable.
