Along with the article, we asked readers to submit videos of their feathered friends showing what makes them unique. We received hundreds of replies. Many of the videos demonstrated a longstanding fascination with the capabilities and intellects of these amazing birds. As it turns out, that fascination has a long history in The Times. A tour of our archives shows that journalists here have been reporting on what parrots can do since the   century. In 1859, a look at a book called \u201cAn Illustrated History of the Animal Kingdom\u201d noted the capabilities of parrots. Some birds could recite the Lord\u2019s Prayer and the Apostles\u2019 Creed, The Times reported. In 1876, an article headlined \u201cAnecdotes of Parrots\u201d recounted the tale of a parrot who died in Britain in 1802 after years spent impressing her owner with her musical ability. She \u201cbeat time with all the appearance of science. \u201d You\u2019ll see these capabilities echoed in the videos submitted by readers, as birds warble tunes they\u2019ve heard people sing and keep beats as steadily as that celebrated musical prodigy. But it wasn\u2019t always the case that parrots were thought of favorably in The Times. An article on the editorial page in 1877 attacked parrots the way the birds themselves tear into food. The polemic was prompted by a Philadelphia man\u2019s proposal to gather the most intelligent parrots and to breed them in a program that sounds a bit like avian eugenics. \u201cThere are few persons or things that are more objectionable than the parrot,\u201d the article began. The editorial continued, \u201cThat offensive style of bird is either kept by misanthropic old ladies or by malignant persons with a special grudge against their neighbors. \u201d After watching the videos submitted by readers, it\u2019s hard to believe such charming birds could belong to people so terrible. Consider our opinion of parrot owners to be fully reformed.'"}, "time": 1742628589.9435542}
