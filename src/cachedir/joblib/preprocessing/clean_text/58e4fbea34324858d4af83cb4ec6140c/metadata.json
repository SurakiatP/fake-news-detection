But no matter what happens on election day (Nov. 8), Trump will not win the majority of the black vote. Many of them are expected to heed the message of president Obama who has warned that the Republican candidate will undo his administration\u2019s legacy. But Trump \u2019s message\u2014to make America great again\u2014might still draw an unlikely group of supporters from within the black community: African immigrants. Foreign-born Africans make up a small share of the US immigrant population, but their numbers have been doubling every decade since 1970. African immigrants living in the US grew from 80,000 in 1970 to 1.8 million as of 2013, according to a study from the Pew Research Center. This group of voters say they are supporting Trump because of a blend of ideals that his candidacy represents: as the new flag bearer for conservative, traditional politics; a political outsider who has chipped away at political correctness; a successful businessman who has consistently reinvented himself to achieve the American dream; and a man sure to deliver them from what they see as the disappointing presidency of Barack Obama . Despite Trump \u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, some African immigrants have been dissatisfied with Obama \u2019s middling Africa policy and think real change from an outsider like themselves could make a positive difference for America their own fortunes. Leading this pack is none other than president Obama \u2019s Kenyan half-brother, Malik. The 58-year-old naturalized US citizen, has spoken about his own brother\u2019s leadership as \u201cdeep disappointment,\u201d and said that Trump was \u201cproviding something new and something fresh\u201d to the American people. Some of the African Trump supporters like Malik have also voiced their concerns about the moral relativism that has pervaded US politics, from abortion rights to marriage equality, to the current debate on transgender bathroom use. I tried to co-exist with my brother Barack Obama but he shut me out; In his Ivory Tower. I gave up. \u2014 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) November 5, 2016 VOTE FOR MR. TRUMP ! Malik already voted. \u2014 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) November 5, 2016 Reno Omokri, once the controversial new media aide to Nigeria\u2019s former president, Goodluck Jonathan, is now a pastor in the San Francisco Bay area. Speaking to the BBC, Omokri said that he supports Trump because he was going to nominate a Supreme Court judge who might reverse, or deal, with these issues from a conservative standpoint. \u201cThose issues, they might seem small to you,\u201d Omokri said, but they \u201care very important to someone like me because I am a conservative and that is why I am supporting Donald Trump .\u201d Khadra Abdirahman is a 24-year-old Somali-American who was born in New York after her parents fled the civil war in Somalia. But as a registered Republican and a first-time voter, she intends to cast her ballot for a political candidate who is against the status quo. Establishment party leaders she said, are oblivious to the populism born out of frustration, which is why she would vote for a candidate like Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders, instead of Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush. Abdirahman, who didn\u2019t support Obama when he ran in 2008 and 2012, thinks the 2016 elections are \u201ca change election\u201d and a \u201crevolutionary election.\u201d She says the \u201csurge of anti-establishment, anti-globalist political revolutions,\u201d the like we have seen with Brexit, should provide the space for candidates like Trump to be elected. \u201cAmerica projects a false image of goodness and truthfulness and it is actually extremely rotten to the core.\u201d Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief \u2014 the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.
