John Kasich should run for President again in 2020, challenging incumbent President Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary. [Schwarzenegger made the endorsement in an interview with the Los Angeles Times:  \u201cHe should run in 2020, yes,\u201d Schwarzenegger said in an interview with The Times when asked whether Kasich, whom he supported over Trump in the 2016 presidential race, should launch another presidential campaign. \u201cKasich is an extraordinary guy. He\u2019s a man of substance. He\u2019s worked in Washington, he\u2019s worked in local government, he\u2019s worked in statewide government. He has the experience. He can see things. He has vision,\u201d Schwarzenegger enthused. \u201cHe\u2019s also a moderate. He\u2019s a tough Republican and very fiscally conservative, but he also at the same time loves helping people. \u201d Schwarzenegger backed Kasich in 2016, to little effect. In the Republican primary, the Ohio governor only carried his home state. Arguably, Kasich made Trump\u2019s primary win easier by staying in the race so long that it became impossible for any Trump challenger  \u2014   specifically, Sen. Ted Cruz ( )  \u2014   to round up the necessary delegates and campaign cash. During the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Kasich refused to show up, angering his own state\u2019s delegation. Despite Kasich\u2019s opposition, Trump carried the crucial Buckeye State by nearly 9 percentage points, taking all 18 Electoral College votes en route to victory. Trump and Schwarzenegger have carried on a war in social media, trading barbs over political issues and particularly over the ratings of The Apprentice, where Schwarzenegger filled in for Trump but later withdrew from the show.
