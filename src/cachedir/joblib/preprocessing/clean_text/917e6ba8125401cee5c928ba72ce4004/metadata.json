Chris Christie of New Jersey with a stunning assertion: The governor himself knew during the lane closings at the George Washington Bridge that they were meant to punish a mayor for declining to endorse him. Over the past six weeks in federal court, prosecutors have portrayed Mr. Christie and his top aides as relentlessly and crassly political. Orders to freeze out enemies came \u201cdirectly from gov,\u201d as his campaign manager relayed in one text message. \u201cGov!\u201d Lee Cortes, a prosecutor, said in his closing argument. \u201cThe governor!\u201d But to borrow an old legal term, having rung that bell loudly and repeatedly, prosecutors now want jurors to pretend they did not hear it. The jury began deliberations on Monday about the two aides: Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni. To decide their fate, the jury has to confront two apparent contradictions in the prosecution\u2019s case. One is the fact that Mr. Christie, a Republican, is not on trial, even though prosecution witnesses have described it as practically Christie administration policy to use government resources to promote his ambitions. The other is the government\u2019s star witness, David Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to orchestrating the   scheme. Prosecutors admit he is a serial liar and inveterate prankster who, as lawyers repeatedly reminded the jury, once stole the jacket of a   United States senator to embarrass him in a debate. \u201cThe guy who stole Frank Lautenberg\u2019s coat? That\u2019s who you relied on?\u201d Mr. Cortes challenged Mr. Baroni in his  . That is also whom the government is relying on, as Mr. Baroni\u2019s lawyer happily noted in his summation. If prosecutors so trusted Mr. Wildstein as a witness, the jury might wonder, why did they not bring charges against Mr. Christie, who, Mr. Wildstein testified, was told about the plot midway through the week of the lane closings in September 2013, when he had the power to reverse them? Judge Susan D. Wigenton instructed the jury not to pay attention to Mr. Christie or the other names prosecutors have mentioned over and over. \u201cThe fact that these persons are not on trial here must play no part in your deliberations,\u201d she told jurors. \u201cTheir absence should not influence your verdict with respect to the defendants on trial at this time. You are not called upon to return a verdict as to the guilt or innocence of any other person or persons. \u201d But will jurors decide, in the memorable words of Ms. Kelly\u2019s lawyer, Michael Critchley, that prosecutors went after a whale and ended up with a minnow? When Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney for New Jersey, announced the indictments in May 2015, he said that he was bringing charges against only the people prosecutors believed a jury would convict. There is not as much documentary evidence that others in the administration were involved in the lane closings and the   Ms. Kelly alone sent the notorious email proclaiming \u201ctime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. \u201d But given everything the jury has heard about Mr. Christie and his other aides punishing local officials, and scrambling to cover up the lane closings, will jurors decide that Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly are more guilty? Or were they simply less discreet in doing what everyone else was doing, too? And if the jury believes that others were involved, what would be more unfair: that it convicted two for the sins of many, or that it acquitted them, and no one paid for the catastrophic traffic jams that paralyzed Fort Lee? The prosecution did not call many potential witnesses who could have told more about what was really happening in the governor\u2019s office. The judge, in a conference with lawyers, said she could think of \u201cabout five\u201d potential witnesses for the jury, suggesting as a start Kevin O\u2019Dowd, the governor\u2019s former chief of staff, and Bill Stepien, his   campaign manager. Mr. Critchley seized the point in his closing argument on Monday, cupping his hands to his mouth and hollering: \u201cChris Christie, where are you? Kevin O\u2019Dowd, where are you?\u201d And, referring to another Christie confidante, he said, \u201cMichele Brown, where are you?\u201d \u201cYou know what that\u2019s called?\u201d Mr. Critchley told the jury. \u201cCowards. They want the mother of four to take the fall for them. \u201d The best example of the fine line the government is walking is an episode that prosecutors portrayed as kind of a preview of the main event: the Christie administration\u2019s retribution against Mayor Steven Fulop of Jersey City. Like Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, he was a Democrat who had declined to endorse Mr. Christie after a long courtship. Three weeks before Ms. Kelly\u2019s infamous email, Mr. Stepien, then the campaign manager, wrote in an email to her that Mr. O\u2019Dowd, then the chief of staff, would be calling her to cancel a special day\u2019s worth of meetings set up between Mr. Fulop and administration officials. Ms. Kelly told Mr. Stepien to tell the mayor that the meetings had been canceled. \u201cBoom,\u201d Mr. Stepien wrote. \u201cThanks. \u201d Ms. Kelly, then in her new job as deputy chief of staff for about three months, expressed regret about having to cancel the meetings. Mr. Stepien, whom prosecutors characterize as her mentor, reassured her: \u201cNo, this is perfect. It will send a good message to this guy. \u201d Mr. Baroni asked whether one of Mr. Christie\u2019s closest confidants, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was allowed to reschedule a meeting with the mayor. \u201cPer Stepien, no meetings with Fulop,\u201d Mr. Wildstein responded in a text message. \u201cOrder that Fulop be frozen out comes directly from gov. \u201d Will the jury accept that in the scheme to freeze out Mr. Sokolich just three weeks later, Mr. Wildstein, Ms. Kelly and Mr. Baroni acted on their own? Prosecutors also savaged Mr. Baroni, once Mr. Christie\u2019s top appointed official at the Port Authority, for his trust in Mr. Wildstein. The defendants said they believed that the lane closings were a legitimate traffic study because Mr. Wildstein told them so. \u201cNoted traffic expert David Wildstein?\u201d Mr. Cortes asked Mr. Baroni. Mr. Baroni\u2019s lawyer, Michael Baldassare, told the jury it was \u201cinsulting\u201d for prosecutors to make fun of his client for relying on Mr. Wildstein. \u201cIt\u2019s O. K. for them to trust him,\u201d Mr. Baldassare said. \u201cIt\u2019s O. K. for them to ask you to trust him. But when Bill trusts the guy, suddenly, apparently, it\u2019s a crime. \u201d In their closing arguments, prosecutors accused defense lawyers of trying to divert attention from the defendants\u2019 actions. The case, they argued, did not hinge solely on Mr. Wildstein. It is backed up by emails, in which Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly seem to know about the attempt to punish Mr. Sokolich and delight in it. \u201cIs it wrong that I am smiling?\u201d Ms. Kelly wrote, hearing of Mr. Sokolich\u2019s complaint that schoolchildren were stuck in the traffic jams. The defendants spoke of \u201cradio silence\u201d as their strategy to ignore his panicked calls for help. \u201cThat\u2019s not the language of victimization,\u201d a prosecutor, Vikas Khanna, said in a final rebuttal on Monday. \u201cThose emails, those text messages, those actions, those are the actions of the defendants, that no one did to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey chose exactly what they were doing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562469.0952115}
