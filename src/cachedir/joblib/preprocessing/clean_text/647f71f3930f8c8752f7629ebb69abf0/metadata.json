Quoting: Anonymous Coward 31310212 Alot of whats in the bible has been written by the demiurge so you have to be careful. Quoting: Anonymous Coward 31310212 If it's in this existence, I don't trust it. And that certainly goes for ALL religions and the new age bullshit too. I don't think it's gonna be a case of saying some little bullshit quote and being able to go free. As for the question, that's what I'm still struggling with. I'd love to take a baseball bat to it and whatever else has trapped us here but I somehow don't think that's gonna work. All I know is I'm not gonna fall for this shit ever again and I'm not coming back to this shithole of a world either. Page 1\""}, "time": 1742563241.138293}
