Rand Paul ( ) said while he supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, it must be replaced immediately or \u201cwithin months of repealing it, you will lead to further bankruptcies in the insurance industry. \u201d  Paul said, \u201cWell here\u2019s the interesting thing about Obamacare, they wanted to provide insurance for everybody, even if you were already sick, preexisting conditions, but they could only pay for it if they forced all of the healthy people to buy insurance through  a mandate. It\u2019s not working so well. What is happening is not enough healthy people are buying insurance and the rates for individual insurance went through the roof and yet insurance companies are still failing and threatening bankruptcy. \u201d He added, \u201cHere is the problem. If you repeal the individual mandate that forces young people to buy insurance less young healthy people buy insurance and the system will spiral quicker. I\u2019m for getting rid of the mandate. I am for repealing Obamacare, but you have to replace it. If you don\u2019t replace it, my prediction is within months of repealing it, you will lead to further bankruptcies in the insurance industry. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562184.3592644}
