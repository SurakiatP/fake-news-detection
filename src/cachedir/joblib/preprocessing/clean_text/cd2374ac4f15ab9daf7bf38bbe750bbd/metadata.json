The regulations, approved last Tuesday, were drawn up after a woman was fatally mauled by a dog in June, and they were set to go into effect on Monday across all 19 boroughs in the Canadian city. The bylaw requires owners to pay higher fees for the animals than for   bull types to go through a   check and to keep a muzzle on the dogs outside, even in fenced backyards. \u201cThe safety and sense of security of Montrealers are a priority,\u201d Mayor Denis Coderre said in a statement after the vote, which he said provided for more stringent control measures. \u201cI was deeply shocked at the recent events involving dog attacks,\u201d he added. \u201cAs a responsible administration, it was our duty to examine this issue closely and make the appropriate decisions. \u201d But opponents denounce the regulations, saying that they unfairly paint all pit bulls, and those dogs similar in appearance, as dangerous. Opposition council members, animal advocates and social media campaigns have protested, saying that the bylaw does not define \u201cpit bull\u201d and that it uses a   approach that has not worked in Canadian cities before. \u201cWe call it panic \u201d said Sterling Downey, an opposition councilman with the Project Montreal party. The regulations are suspended until Wednesday as Judge Louis Gouin considers a request from the Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to throw them out, the Associated Press reported. The group filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against the city, saying it would seek to prevent the regulations from being enforced. It said that the bylaw would discourage adoptions and lead to more dogs being euthanized. The decision to enact the measure came after a    Montreal woman was bitten and killed by a dog in June. A Montreal police spokesman, Benoit Boisselle, said a neighbor found the woman dead in her backyard. The police shot and killed the dog when they arrived because it was too aggressive for the officers to approach, he said in a telephone interview on Friday. He said he did not know the breed of the dog. With their blocky heads and square jaws, pit bulls have a fearsome reputation in popular culture. They have often been portrayed as overly aggressive toward humans, or   fighters and guard dogs. The dogs known by the catchall phrase as pit bulls fall into four breeds: the American pit bull terrier, the American Staffordshire terrier, the Staffordshire bull terrier and the American bully. But pit bulls are also known as any   dog with a blocky head and muscular build. Online, they are either vilified or defended. There are videos of pit bull fights, gruesome bite photographs and archives of attacks. Animal experts say that the dogs\u2019 reputation is unfounded and that blame for aggressive behavior should fall on their handlers. \u201cThere is this idea that somehow they are unstable, relentlessly aggressive and treacherous,\u201d said Bronwen Dickey, whose book \u201cPit Bull: The Battle Over an American Icon\u201d also questioned the basis for the fearful reputation of the animals, such as that they have extraordinarily strong biting jaws and are prone to using them. \u201cThere is always this narrative that they turn on you, that they are unpredictable,\u201d she said. The dogs are generally about 65 to 80 pounds. Centuries ago, they were bred to be used in slaughterhouses to prevent bulls from escaping, said Dr. Bonnie Beaver, a professor at Texas AM University\u2019s veterinary medicine college. As terriers, they tend to be territorial and individualistic. \u201cThey are not more aggressive than any other dog,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBut the terriers tend to have, I would call them, a shorter temper,\u201d she said, meaning they switch \u201cfrom their thinking brain to their emotional brain faster. \u201d \u201cIf the human owner doesn\u2019t have the ability to prevent that switch into the emotional brain, then that dog is off on its own,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of the times when these bans come into effect, it is one or two very tragic events that involved big dogs. \u201d Harout Chitilian, a council member and the chairman of Montreal\u2019s executive committee, said that since January 2015, there were 426 situations involving dog bites. Of the 362 cases in which the dogs could be identified, about half were pit bulls. \u201cIt was a very, very difficult debate, but we looked at the figures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a choice to be even more harsh, to eliminate ownership, but we recognized that they are part of the family. \u201d But Mr. Downey noted that the dog in the June attack was registered as a \u201cbulldog\u201d and that there were no DNA tests to prove it was a breed of pit bull or a mixed breed. Certain breeds of dogs have also been banned in the United Kingdom, and in the United States the effectiveness of such laws is controversial because it is not clear whether they work, and they single out one type of animal. Other Canadian boroughs and cities, like Calgary, have tightened measures on animal ownership instead of instituting an outright ban. In Ontario, Ottawa has said it does not enforce the province\u2019s ban, and Toronto is revising its   ban to include dangerous dogs, but not those specific to a breed, Mr. Downey noted.'"}, "time": 1742562178.715599}
