[In a statement from the press office, the White House said Trump acted on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.  \u201cThe FBI is one of our Nation\u2019s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement,\u201d Trump said in a statement announcing Comey\u2019s termination. In a letter to the president Tuesday, Sessions wrote that after an evaluation, he had concluded that \u201ca fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI. \u201d \u201cIt is essential that this Department of Justice clearly reaffirm its commitment to longstanding principles that ensure the integrity and fairness of federal investigations and prosecutions,\u201d Sessions wrote. \u201cThe Director of the FBI must be someone who follows faithfully the rules and principles of the Department of Justice and who sets the right example for our law enforcement officials and others in the Department. \u201d In his own memorandum to the Attorney General Tuesday, Rosenstein said the reputation and credibility of the FBI had \u201csuffered substantial damage\u201d in the last year. The deputy attorney general cited Comey\u2019s handling of the investigation into former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server as a \u201ctextbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do. \u201d The president also sent a letter to Comey Tuesday informing him he had been terminated effective immediately. \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgement of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIt is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission. \u201d More docs, letter from AG Sessions on firing FBI Director James Comey   \u2026     pic. twitter.   \u2014   Michelle Moons (@MichelleDiana) May 9, 2017,  More docs, letter from AG Sessions on firing FBI Director James Comey   \u2026     pic. twitter.   \u2014   Michelle Moons (@MichelleDiana) May 9, 2017,  Comey did not immediately release a statement confirming his dismissal. Comey was appointed FBI Director by former president Barack Obama in September 2013. He served as deputy attorney general under the George W. Bush administration from December 2003 until August 2005. Prior to that, he was U. S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he prosecuted a number of major terrorism and criminal cases. He also worked in the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia from 1996 to 2001, and had served as general counsel and senior vice president for Lockheed Martin and general counsel for the investment firm Bridgewater Associates. Comey became a controversial figure in the 2016 presidential race for the agency\u2019s handling of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server. He came under fire again days before the November 8 election when he announced the discovery of additional emails related to the investigation. In March, Comey testified that the FBI was investigating the Russian government\u2019s possible interference in the 2016 election,  including the \u201cnature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts. \u201d During his appointment ceremony in October 2013, Comey described the obligation of the FBI as having to balance independence from \u201call political forces and interests\u201d in the United States with its enforcement of the rule of law and the country\u2019s system of checks and balances. \u201cYou see, those three words  \u2014   Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity  \u2014   capture the essence of the FBI and its people. And they also explain why I am here,\u201d Comey said at the time, according to a White House transcript. \u201cI wanted to be here to work alongside those people, to represent them, to help them accomplish their mission, and to just be their colleague. \u201d   This is a developing story.
