In fact they are   on their identity politics,\u201d claimed MILO. \u201cConservatives aren\u2019t just deplorables and racists, we\u2019re \u2018white nationalist hatemongers\u2019. And white women and the working class who voted for Trump are too. They\u2019ve ramped up their fake news activities to prove how wrong we all are, and their top weapon is fake hate crimes. \u201d \u201cAmerica has a problem with fake hate crimes. The left is always searching for the next big outrage, and sometimes when the pressure gets too high, they just decide to make them up,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat is basically how the UVA rape fantasy that ran in Rolling Stone came about by the way. This trend has just accelerated since the election. Fake attacks on Muslim women seem to be in vogue right now. But it isn\u2019t a new trend. I wrote an article in May 2016 that documented 100 fake hate crimes in the last decade. 100 of them! And surely there were more that just didn\u2019t make it into the public eye. \u201d \u201cI bring this up because Colorado Springs is part of the list. In 2015, threats were left outside of a predominantly black church referencing the KKK and a second one says \u2018Black men beware, you are the target\u2019,\u201d MILO declared. \u201cThere\u2019s just one problem  \u2026    . This is the evil racist local police found behind the messages. \u201d In Scooby Doo unmasking fashion, MILO displayed the image of the black perpetrator onto the projector. \u201cWoops, it\u2019s a black guy!\u201d he announced. \u201cSadly, this is part of an increasing trend in the US towards sensational but untrue stories. Fake hate crimes are the original fake news. \u201d \u201cI mentioned the UVA rape case, which was a complete fabrication happily carried by the leftist media. Of course everyone with a brain knows that rape culture on campus is a myth,\u201d he concluded. \u201c1 in 4 women on campus will not be raped, and American universities are not more dangerous than   African nations. \u201d \u201cSorry about it. \u201d Written from prepared remarks.
