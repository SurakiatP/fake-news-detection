Radiocarbon dating has determined it is from the 7th century BCE, making it one of just three extant Hebrew papyri from that period, and predating the Dead Sea Scrolls by centuries. \\nThe IAA\u2019s Eitan Klein said the dating of the papyrus had been confirmed by comparing the text\u2019s orthography with other texts from the period.'"}, "time": 1742561682.3131588}
