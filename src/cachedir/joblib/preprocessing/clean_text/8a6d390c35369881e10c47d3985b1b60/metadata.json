Trump\u2019s repeated questioning of Russia\u2019s role. They suggested that the doubts Mr. Trump has expressed on Twitter about the agencies\u2019 competence and impartiality were undermining their morale. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between skepticism and disparagement,\u201d James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, said at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Russian hacks. He added that \u201cour assessment now is even more resolute\u201d that the Russians carried out the attack on the election. The Senate hearing was the prelude to an extraordinary meeting scheduled for Friday, when Mr. Clapper and other intelligence chiefs will repeat for Mr. Trump the same detailed, highly classified briefing on the Russian attack that President Obama received on Thursday. In effect, they will be telling the   that the spy agencies believe he won with an assist from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Then Mr. Trump will have to say whether he accepts the agencies\u2019 basic findings on Russia\u2019s role or holds to his previous contention that inept, politicized American spies have gotten the perpetrator of the hacking wrong. That would throw the intelligence agencies into a crisis of credibility and status with few, if any, precedents. In a pair of Twitter posts early Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to back away from the scorn he had previously expressed for the intelligence agencies\u2019 work, as well as from his embrace of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, which released most of the hacked emails of Democratic officials. \u201cThe dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange  \u2014   wrong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against \u2018Intelligence\u2019 when in fact I am a big fan!\u201d But on Thursday night, the   returned to Twitter and appeared to underscore his doubts about the F. B. I. \u2019s investigation of the hacking. \u201cThe Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia,\u201d he wrote, a day after a report by BuzzFeed on the issue. \u201cSo how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?\u201d Early next week, the public will get its fullest information to date on the evidence the agencies have to support their contention that Mr. Putin\u2019s government used the hacked emails to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and help Mr. Trump\u2019s. Mr. Clapper said he would \u201cpush the envelope\u201d to include as much detail as possible in the unclassified version of the intelligence agencies\u2019 report on the Russian operation. The hacking, he added, was only one part of that operation, which also included the dissemination of \u201cclassical propaganda, disinformation, fake news. \u201d Mr. Clapper will step down as intelligence director later this month after a career in intelligence and military service that began when he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1961. His replacement is expected to be Dan Coats, a retired senator from Indiana, a Trump transition official said Thursday. A   conservative who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Coats would oversee the nation\u2019s 16 intelligence agencies in a job that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to improve the sharing of information, but that is sometimes criticized as adding a layer of bureaucracy. The Coats news came on the same day that R. James Woolsey, a former C. I. A. director, stepped down as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, citing his diminishing role in the transition. The Senate hearing on Thursday, devoted to foreign cyberthreats, was unusual as much for its context as its content  \u2014   a public, bipartisan display of support for the intelligence community that seemed aimed, at times, at an audience of one. Though Mr. Clapper and most Republican senators were careful to avoid antagonizing the   directly, the hearing spoke to the rift Mr. Trump has threatened to create between the incoming administration and the intelligence officials assigned to inform it. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the committee, said the purpose of the gathering was \u201cnot to question the outcome of the presidential election\u201d but to move forward with a full understanding of what had happened. Repeatedly, though, Mr. McCain and his colleagues seemed to undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s past messages of support for Russia, and for Mr. Assange of WikiLeaks. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s any credibility we should attach to this individual?\u201d Mr. McCain asked. \u201cNot in my view,\u201d Mr. Clapper said. Another witness at the hearing, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, said he agreed. The intelligence director said he welcomed skeptical questioning from Mr. Trump, allowing that the intelligence community was \u201cnot perfect. \u201d \u201cWe are an organization of human beings, and we\u2019re prone, sometimes, to make errors,\u201d Mr. Clapper said. But he said the agencies had learned from their failures, notably their declaration that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Democrats on the committee repeatedly coaxed intelligence leaders to rebut Mr. Trump\u2019s multiple assertions that a random individual hacker might have hacked Democratic targets. Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, told Mr. Clapper that in the conflict between the intelligence agencies and Mr. Assange over Russian responsibility for the attack, \u201cWe\u2019re on your side every time. \u201d He asked Mr. Clapper to convey his level of confidence in attributing the election attack to Russia, rather than \u201csomeone in his basement. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, very high,\u201d the laconic intelligence director replied. At one point, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, wondered aloud \u201cwho benefits from a   trashing the intelligence community. \u201d Ms. McCaskill said there would be \u201chowls from the Republican side of the aisle\u201d if a Democrat had spoken about intelligence officials as Mr. Trump had. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, used the occasion for an aside about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, who has a history of sharing discredited news stories and conspiracy theories. Mr. Kaine said that he was unsure whether Mr. Flynn was acting out of \u201cgullibility\u201d or \u201cmalice,\u201d but that it was a cause for \u201cgreat concern\u201d that Mr. Flynn shared stories that \u201cmost fourth graders would find incredible. \u201d No Republican lawmakers embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks casting doubt on the intelligence conclusions, though some were more conspicuous than others in their efforts to distance themselves. Perhaps the closest to a defense of Mr. Trump came from Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas. Denouncing \u201cimprecise language\u201d stating that Russia \u201chacked the election,\u201d Mr. Cotton asked Mr. Clapper to confirm that the actual balloting was not affected. Mr. Cotton also suggested that the conventional wisdom that Mr. Putin favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton might be wrong. Mr. Trump promised a stronger military and more American oil and gas production  \u2014   policies Mr. Cotton suggested would not be to Russia\u2019s advantage. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, criticized the Obama administration for its response to the Russian attack. He said the White House had lobbed mere \u201cpebbles\u201d in retaliation for the interference. \u201cWhen it comes to interfering with our election, we better be ready to throw rocks,\u201d he said. Then Mr. Graham issued a warning for fellow Republicans who might be inclined to brush off any attack on an opposing party. \u201cCould it be Republicans next election?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re so much better at cybersecurity than Democrats. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561899.2738426}
