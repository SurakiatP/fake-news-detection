[In an interview with Channel 4\u2019s Cathy Newman on Tuesday night, the presenter asked: \u201cA while back I asked you if you thought that homosexuality was a sin and you struggled to answer.  \u201cNow you\u2019ve had a while to consider that question, what is the answer?\u201d Mr. Farron, who is an observant member of the Church of England, responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think I struggled to answer it at all, Cathy. I think I\u2019m not in the position to make theological announcements over the next six weeks. \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend my time talking theology or making pronouncements. \u201d The presenter then reminded him that in a 2015 interview she asked him three times if he thought homosexuality was a sin and he responded: \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners. \u201d She asked him if this was still the answer. \u201cAs a Liberal, I\u2019m passionate about equality, about equal marriage and about equal rights for LGBT people, for fighting for LGBT rights, not just in this country but overseas,\u201d he responded. \u201cJust because I\u2019m Christian, it would be a bit boring for everybody to spend the next weeks asking me to make theological announcements that I\u2019m not going to make. \u201d His response was not good enough for some, however. TV presenter Sue Perkins tweeted: \u201cTim Farron on C4 news failing to clarify his views on the gay community. \u2018We\u2019re all sinners\u2019. It\u2019s 2017. \u201d Tim Farron on C4 news failing to clarify his views on the gay community. \u2019We\u2019re all sinners\u2019.  It\u2019s 2017.  \u2014   Sue Perkins (@sueperkins) April 18, 2017,  Meanwhile, comedian David Baddiel even branded Mr. Farron a \u201cfundamentalist Christian homophobe\u201d with fellow comedian David Walliams adding: \u201cMr @timfarron you are definitely a sinner for your continued intolerance  prejudice. Please try and join the rest of us in the year 2017. \u201d Problem with people saying it\u2019s Tim Farron who\u2019s talking the most sense is: he\u2019s a fundamentalist Christian homophobe. #notsurehowwegothere,  \u2014   David Baddiel (@Baddiel) April 18, 2017,  Mr @timfarron you are definitely a sinner for your continued intolerance  prejudice. Please try and join the rest of us in the year 2017.  \u2014   David Walliams (@davidwalliams) April 18, 2017,  Tim Farron joined nine other Liberal Democrat MPs in abstaining in the vote on gay marriage in 2013. However, he said his abstention did not mean he opposed it.'"}, "time": 1742563815.2358105}
