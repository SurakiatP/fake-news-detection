I think it's a symbol for all of us against sexual assault.\u201d \\nHe said his intention was to sell pieces of the star to raise money for the women who have accused Trump of sexual wrongdoing. None of the women have provided concrete proof of their claims. \\nThe man, a self-proclaimed activist, admitted in an exclusive TMZ interview that this isn't his first rodeo: \\n\u201cI'm a non violent activist. I've been arrested 24, 25 times. I'd love to go to court with Mr. Trump, it would be a great honor.\u201d \\nWithout irony, the man claimed that Trump is \u201ca bully\u201d and that he needs to \u201cease up.\u201d \\nThis isn't the first time Trump's star has been the target of vandals. Recently, the star was surrounded by a cement box: \\nImage Credit: Screengrab/ YouTube \\nUnfortunately for Mr. Otis, police are currently looking for him, with the possibility that he'll be charged with a felony. Additionally, the star he destroyed in the name of justice is worth $30,000. \""}, "time": 1742561689.2248447}
