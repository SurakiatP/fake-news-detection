She wouldn\u2019t even mention their names (Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, Sean Smith and Ambassador Chris Stevens). \\nShe was talking about a discussion to include the Benghazi attacks as opening statements for a speech: \\nSeems odd to put the tributes to the four guys into this statement, since it is mostly the repackaged testimony. We can\u2019t overdo the tributes to them and I think they should be done in person. \\nThx \\nGrunwald Communications \\nVice Presidential candidate Mike Pence didn\u2019t respond well, Breitbart reports : \\n\u201cThis just came out today\u2026when her staff was preparing her for testimony, an opening statement for the select committee on Benghazi, one of them actually mentioned in an email that she shouldn\u2019t focus too much on the \u2018four guys\u2019 who were killed,\u201d said Pence. \\n\u201cThose were not four guys. Those were four American heroes,\u201d Pence said to shouts of affirmation and applause. \\n\u201cWhen she was questioned about the reason for the attacks she actually said of those four American heroes, she actually said, \u2018What difference, at this point, does it make?\u2019 \\nHe continued, \u201cLet me tell you something, I\u2019m a father of a United States Marine. Anybody who said that, anybody who did that, should be disqualified from ever serving as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.\u201d \\n\u201cIt was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm\u2019s way in Benghazi,\u201d Pence remarked to the New Hampshire crowd earlier in his address. \\nClinton and her staff\u2019s dismissiveness of these four heroes \u2013 who she was responsible for \u2013 is absolutely unforgivable .'"}, "time": 1742563261.4244795}
