Douglas Wilder. The     building, with Greek Doric columns flanking the entrance, was once the home of Richmond\u2019s first   Baptist church. For the trailblazing Mr. Wilder, the nation\u2019s first elected   governor, it represents the ideal setting for the United States National Slavery Museum, an institution he has struggled to create for nearly two and a half decades. The building is only an hour\u2019s drive from the Fredericksburg site where Mr. Wilder\u2019s first vision for the project, a $100 million museum designed by one of the world\u2019s leading architecture firms, collapsed amid a welter of debt and recriminations. Two years ago, Mr. Wilder announced his latest plan at a news conference at the state Capitol, a more modest proposal, in an existing building in a town he\u2019s long called home and where his government service and star power can still draw admirers. But this museum project appears no closer to reality than the last. The organization\u2019s most recent tax filing, for 2014, reveals contributions of $0. His new   site, the former First African Baptist Church, is still owned by Virginia Commonwealth University and houses its department of clinical laboratory services. And just over a   away, where a notorious   compound known as \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Half Acre\u201d stood, a competing slavery museum proposal  \u2014   championed by this city\u2019s mayor and seeded with $18 million in state and city funding  \u2014   is barreling toward groundbreaking in the fall of 2017. As the $540 million National Museum of African American History and Culture on the Mall in Washington prepares to open this fall, more attention than ever will be paid to the story of slavery and emancipation that Mr. Wilder has sought to recount and memorialize. But his institution will not be a part of that conversation, its artifacts in storage, its allies dwindling and its prospects approaching quixotic. Mr. Wilder, still prickly and proud at 85, remains undaunted. He declined to comment for this article, but in a memoir published last year, he said he\u2019s optimistic his museum could be ready by 2019, the 400th anniversary of the first African slaves arriving in Jamestown. \u201cMy struggle has constantly been referred to as a \u2018personal crusade,\u2019 implying that it is something I would benefit from in some way,\u201d Mr. Wilder wrote in \u201cSon of Virginia: A Life in America\u2019s Political Arena. \u201d \u201cCombating that assumption is one reason I have persisted. This is not a personal crusade but a national necessity. \u201d And the grit of this grandson of slaves, who served in Korea but still had to leave Virginia to find a law school that would admit him, has long been acknowledged. \u201cGovernor Wilder has always struck me as a man of great determination and persistence,\u201d said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, in Fredericksburg. \u201cFor him to accomplish what he did, starting in the days of Jim Crow, is an extraordinary accomplishment. And sometimes persistent, determined politicians need to remain persistent and determined to get their initiatives to come to fruition. \u201d The inspiration for a slavery museum came to Mr. Wilder during a trade mission to Africa he took as governor of Virginia in the early 1990s. In Senegal, he toured the slave houses and, as he recounts in his memoir, \u201csaw how human beings were stuffed into bins, inspected and priced like products, branded like cattle, and packed into the holds of ships. \u201d \u201cI returned from Africa,\u201d he added, \u201cwith a single thought burning in my mind: We had to tell the story and keep our history alive as a charge of eternal vigilance. \u201d Last decade, he appeared close to realizing his vision. The museum project was given 38 acres by a developer to use as part of a \u201cCelebrate Virginia\u201d tourism and shopping complex in Fredericksburg. The architect C. C. Pei, a son of I. M. Pei, designed a modernist    building, its two halves connected by an atrium in which a replica of a slave ship was to be hung. Bill Cosby donated $1. 2 million. Companies like Philip Morris USA and the Wachovia Corporation pledged   sums. By 2011, though, the museum, strapped for funds to pay city real estate taxes, filed for bankruptcy. Some people who had donated their treasured artifacts demanded them back. The land where the museum was supposed to rise was sold last year. A mix of bafflement and bad feelings still resides in Fredericksburg. \u201cThe first inkling I had that something wasn\u2019t right was when Wilder came and met with the Fredericksburg City Council in a closed session,\u201d in 2001, said the city\u2019s mayor at the time, Bill Beck. \u201cHe was obviously sincere about the issue and the subject matter. But it struck me that for a guy who\u2019d been talking about a museum at that point for a number of years he really hadn\u2019t given much thought to how a museum operates and what a museum is. \u201d Mr. Wilder first told the council his museum would cover a period of history that ended with the Civil War, Mr. Beck said. Then, a few minutes later, he suggested that the museum should take the story through the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. Mr. Beck said that he was frustrated by the lack of transparency and professionalism surrounding the project. He said the council, for example, learned the museum might be coming to Fredericksburg only when Mr. Wilder broke the news at a gathering of slave descendants at Montpelier, the estate of James Madison. \u201cHe never did any of the things you would do in terms of starting a museum,\u201d he said. Mr. Beck, an antiques dealer, said he was not impressed by items from the collection displayed at a local university in 2004 and didn\u2019t think the museum had hired enough professionals to staff such an ambitious venture. \u201cHe never did anything practical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all show. \u201d In his memoir, Mr. Wilder writes that he\u2019s at a loss \u201cto fully explain why the project got so badly bogged down. \u201d Several possible culprits are cited: the city\u2019s refusal to grant the museum   status   competition from other museums, including the Smithsonian\u2019s   museum a deep recession. But foremost, Mr. Wilder said he felt the location was all wrong. Fredericksburg, he wrote in his memoir, was \u201coff the beaten track for tourism. \u201d Mr. Beck, told of that explanation, tried, but failed, to suppress a chuckle. A significant Civil War battle was fought in Fredericksburg, and George Washington\u2019s boyhood home is just across the river. \u201cWe\u2019re not Rockefeller Center,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s really kind of silly. \u201d Mr. Wilder has maintained that Richmond was always his first choice for the museum and that he\u2019s learned from previous missteps. \u201cThe vision that we had in Fredericksburg was grandiose,\u201d Mr. Wilder said in 2014. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be the case here. The building is built, and it would fit the needs of the museum. \u201d Except that some of the problems from Fredericksburg  \u2014   communication breakdowns with local officials, for example  \u2014   have resurfaced in Richmond. The building, the former First African Baptist Church, holds deep significance for Mr. Wilder. As a child, he attended Sunday school there, and both his father and grandfather were deacons and trustees. Yet its owner, V. C. U.  \u2014   where the School of Government and Public Affairs is named after Mr. Wilder and where he teaches  \u2014   was caught off guard by his formal announcement. Although Mr. Wilder had casually mentioned the idea to the university\u2019s president over lunch a week before the news conference, the university said no commitment was given. More than two years later, little has changed. In a statement, V. C. U. acknowledged Mr. Wilder\u2019s interest and noted that state funding had come through for a new building for the School of Allied Health Professions that would allow the school to vacate the former church. But, the statement continued, \u201ca number of details about construction of the new building and relocation of the offices will need to be worked out before we can continue the conversation about the slavery museum proposal. \u201d Talks with the city  \u2014   which controls the state funding for a heritage site  \u2014   have been nonexistent. \u201cI have not heard from anyone about any new ideas for another museum,\u201d Mayor Dwight C. Jones said. Mr. Jones talks emotionally about the historical imperative of building a slavery museum in a city replete with Confederate monuments. But he and others favor not the church but a new museum and pavilion on the site of what was once Lumpkin\u2019s Jail, where slaves were held in horrific conditions before being sold at auction. During the height of the interstate slave trade, when Richmond trailed only New Orleans in sales, Lumpkin\u2019s was arguably the most infamous slave jail in the center of the city\u2019s chattel business. After the Civil War, Robert Lumpkin\u2019s widow, a former slave named Mary, leased the property to a Baptist minister seeking to build a seminary for freed slaves. It eventually became Virginia Union University. What had been known as \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Half Acre\u201d had become \u201cGod\u2019s Half Acre. \u201d \u201cYou had enslavement you had emancipation then education and enlightenment,\u201d said Delores L. McQuinn, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and chairwoman of the Richmond Slave Trail Commission. Ms. McQuinn, a champion of the jail site, recalled bumping into Mr. Wilder several years ago during a ceremony to unveil plaques honoring   who served Virginia during Reconstruction. \u201cI said to him at the time: \u2018You\u2019re looking for a museum, and we\u2019re working toward that. Is it something we could join forces to do? \u2019\u201d Ms. McQuinn said. \u201cHe said he\u2019d get back with me. I have not heard anything from him. \u201d And it\u2019s difficult to imagine much good will between those behind the two projects since Mr. Wilder, who served as mayor before Mr. Jones, publicly lambasted his successor and his administration earlier this year. Mr. Jones did not answer directly when asked if Mr. Wilder\u2019s criticism made cooperation more difficult, saying only, \u201cWe have the money, we have the site, and what we\u2019re doing is going to happen. \u201d The city\u2019s plans for the jail site are underway. Architectural and engineering contracts will be awarded soon, and the groundbreaking is projected for next year. Mr. Jones controls $10 million committed by the state and another $8 million from the city for the project. It\u2019s unclear how much money Mr. Wilder\u2019s museum organization has at this point. The museum was able to sell the land in Fredericksburg last year for $400, 000. The math and the politics do not look promising for Mr. Wilder. \u201cThe city\u2019s project seems to be on a firmer financial footing, and that will be decisive in all likelihood,\u201d said Mr. Farnsworth, the professor. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure that two separate visions for the same project can both be constructed. \u201d Still, Mr. Farnsworth doesn\u2019t count out the tenacious Mr. Wilder from securing a role in whatever slavery museum does get built in Richmond. A rambunctious mayoral election is underway. The incumbent, Mr. Jones, is bumping up against term limits. Eight candidates are vying to succeed him. At least one is considered an ally of Mr. Wilder, who recently helped organize and moderate a mayoral forum. Yes, L. Douglas Wilder\u2019s embrace may not carry as much weight as it did when he was governor or Richmond mayor. But he is still L. Douglas Wilder, still a Virginia institution, and he does not go down easy.'"}, "time": 1742561737.0588014}
