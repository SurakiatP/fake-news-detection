Previously released emails have revealed some advisers were frustrated that Clinton hadn\u2019t made information about the server public sooner. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,\u201d policy adviser Neera Tanden wrote to Podesta that same evening, March 2, 2015. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Podesta replied. Other messages show the Clinton campaign caught unprepared for the New York Times story , published weeks before Clinton launched her bid for the White House. Also on March 2, Podesta asked future campaign manager Robby Mook if he had seen it coming . \u201cDid you have any idea of the depth of this story?\u201d Podesta asked Mook in an email late on the evening. \u201cNope,\u201d Mook responded after 1 a.m. that night. \u201cWe brought up the existence of emails in reserach [sic] this summer but were told that everything was taken care of.\u201d In other messages, Clinton\u2019s aides spent hours debating language for Clinton to use defending and eventually apologizing for her actions.
