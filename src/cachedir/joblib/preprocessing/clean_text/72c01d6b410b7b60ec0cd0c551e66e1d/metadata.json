But people have become cynical about their government. \u201d But Mr. Perdue, a Republican who is awaiting confirmation to serve as President Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary, became a target of frequent criticism that he was failing to honor his own ethics pledge during his eight years as governor. The criticism centers on the fact that, as Mr. Trump has, he continued to own or help run his family business ventures  \u2014   four   companies  \u2014   while serving as governor. Mr. Perdue is one of the last cabinet members awaiting Senate confirmation. No date has been set for his confirmation hearing a holdup in the release of paperwork accompanying his nomination by the federal Office of Government Ethics has been blamed for the delay. The office must examine Mr. Perdue\u2019s proposal to avoid conflicts of interest while running the U. S. D. A. as the department is known, which may include selling off some of his farming assets. Before his tenure as governor ended in 2011, 13 complaints had been filed against Mr. Perdue with the State Ethics Commission, which on two occasions ruled that the governor had violated state ethics laws. The commission took the unusual step of fining Mr. Perdue while he was governor. There were numerous other questions, including some about the role of Mr. Perdue\u2019s personal lawyer  \u2014   also a state legislator  \u2014   in pushing a bill through the legislature that included a special provision that gave Mr. Perdue $100, 000 in state tax relief. And, when his tenure as governor was coming to a close, Mr. Perdue met with Georgia officials who oversee the state\u2019s ports to discuss use of a terminal for a family business, according to documents obtained by The Atlanta  . Soon after he left office, in fact, he opened a new company that specialized in exporting products through Savannah. \u201cWhen you are a public official you are supposed to be acting entirely on behalf of the public and not for \u201d said Yasha Heidari, former senior legal counsel to the State Ethics Commission. \u201cLooking at his record, as both an attorney and a citizen of the state, I had serious concerns. \u201d In a written statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perdue rejected that assessment, saying that the frequent criticism he faced while governor was largely politically motivated. \u201cThere hadn\u2019t been a Republican governor in Georgia for 135 years,\u201d the statement said. \u201cGovernor Perdue was the David who slew the Democrats\u2019 Goliath. \u201d During the wait for Mr. Perdue\u2019s confirmation hearing, some in the farming industry have come to his defense. \u201cI don\u2019t think you are going to find a man any more honorable than Sonny Perdue,\u201d said Zippy Duvall, a Georgia cattle and poultry farmer who is the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, adding that he had known Mr. Perdue for about a decade. \u201cHe is as ethical as they come. \u201d Born into a family of farmers, Mr. Perdue played college football as a   at the University of Georgia, and later worked briefly as a practicing veterinarian. He rose through the ranks of the state legislature and, in the late 1990s, switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican because, he said, the state party had lost its focus on family values. One of Mr. Perdue\u2019s first acts after he was sworn in as governor in January 2003 was to sign an executive order establishing a new code of ethics for executive branch employees. The order, which applied to the governor himself, prohibited state employees from using their powers for \u201cany financial or other personal benefit\u201d and barred them from taking any gifts worth more than $25. \u201cIn carrying out their official duties and obligations, all officers and employees of state government must work solely for the public good, striving vigilantly to avoid even the appearance that their actions are motivated by private or personal interest,\u201d the 2003 executive order said. But Mr. Perdue ended up collecting at least $25, 000 worth of benefits or gifts during his years as governor, state records show. The gifts ranged from tickets to a Nascar race and football games to flights paid for by Altria, the tobacco company, and by CSX, the railroad giant, according to a 2010 report by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group. Mr. Perdue\u2019s spokeswoman, in the written statement, said that none of these gifts violated the ban because the \u201ctrips were for official state business and were perfectly acceptable as saving taxpayer funds. \u201d \u201cThe gifts were to the state,\u201d the statement read, \u201cnot to the governor. \u201d The fine by the State Ethics Commission in 2005 came after the commission concluded that Mr. Perdue had failed to properly report the use of an airplane owned by one of his family\u2019s businesses for a   trip. The commission also found that he had taken campaign contributions in amounts that exceeded state limits from several donors  \u2014   including a political action committee run by SunTrust, the   bank. Mr. Perdue called the violations technical, and the investigation politically motivated. Teddy Lee, the executive secretary of the State Ethics Commission, was fired from his job in January 2006, and in an interview he blamed Mr. Perdue for his firing. Mr. Lee had served in the job under four governors. \u201cThis looked like a political hit to me,\u201d Mr. Lee said. Mr. Lee\u2019s dismissal came as Mr. Perdue was seeking   and just months before his largest scandal emerged, over a $100, 000 state tax break he received thanks to a legislative maneuver engineered by a lawmaker who was also his personal lawyer. The focus of the controversy was a piece of property in Florida that Mr. Perdue purchased in 2004. The purchase allowed him to defer paying federal capital gains taxes on a separate piece of Georgia land  \u2014   which he had previously sold at a profit. When that transaction was completed, Mr. Perdue still owed Georgia about $100, 000 in state taxes. Then, Mr. Perdue signed a bill the following year eliminating that state tax obligation  \u2014   as state law was changed to allow   rollover relief on capital gains, even if the new property being purchased was out of state. During deliberations on the legislation, Larry O\u2019Neal, a member of the Georgia House of Representatives who also worked part time as a personal lawyer for Mr. Perdue, intervened to make the change in that provision retroactive. That meant it would cover Mr. Perdue\u2019s 2004 land deal, saving the governor $100, 000, The   reported at the time. Mr. Perdue\u2019s spokeswoman said the change in state law was not intended to benefit Mr. Perdue. \u201cIt benefited all Georgians,\u201d the statement said. Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization that keeps a close watch on policies at the Agriculture Department, said he had questions about Mr. Perdue\u2019s fitness to take over the department. \u201cGiven his record of   and conflicts of interest as governor of Georgia, it is fair to ask if he is fit to run a $    federal agency,\u201d Mr. Faber said. But Mr. Duvall, of the American Farm Bureau Federation, believes the opposite. Mr. Duvall said that as a former farmer, Mr. Perdue is just what the nation needs to run the department. \u201cHe has worked on a farm and owned businesses that buy and sell grain domestically and internationally,\u201d Mr. Duvall said. \u201cIt ought to be a requirement that someone who runs the U. S. D. A. knows something about farming. And Sonny certainly does. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562800.409539}
