Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nHopefully, as a country, we\u2019ll return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare. But this year, when the man at the top of the Republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses, isn\u2019t likely to be that time. \\nOn Wednesday, former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh, a right-wing extremist who now hosts a talk radio show, followed his nominee\u2019s lead and told urged his Twitter followers to grab their guns on Nov. 9 if Hillary Clinton is elected. \\nTweet: On November 8th, I\u2019m voting for Trump. \\nOn November 9th, if Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket. \\nYou in? \\n\u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 \\nThis type of language from someone who used to be \u2013 and thankfully no longer is \u2013 a member of the United States Congress is abhorrent, but it\u2019s also to be expected in the Trump era of American politics. \\nAfter all, not long ago Trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if Clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate Supreme Court judges. \\n\u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d the Republican nominee said. \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people \u2014 maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d \\nMore recently, Trump said that he\u2019d like to see what happens if Clinton\u2019s bodyguards were disarmed. \\n\u201cI think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cTake their guns away, let\u2019s see what happens to her.\u201d \\nNot only does Walsh\u2019s rhetoric align perfectly with what Trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign, but it\u2019s also a continuation of dangerous language that the former Republican congressman seems to enjoy using. \\nEarlier in the year, when five police officers were gunned down in Dallas, Walsh blamed President Obama, tweeting: \u201cThis is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you.\u201d \\nBefore Trump hit the scene, this type of rhetoric existed, but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party. Now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee. \\nOn Nov. 9, we shouldn\u2019t hope that people take up arms to protest the results of the election. We should hope that when Trump loses, he\u2019ll take a lot of this dangerous rhetoric with him.\""}, "time": 1742562193.7048345}
