[Salman Abedi was an associate and childhood friend of Bilal Ahmed, who was jailed with two others for a total of 29 years in 2016 for taking part in the brutal gang rape of the   .  Members of the rapists\u2019 South Manchester community \u201cintimidated and goaded\u201d the victim and her family members throughout the trial, and hurled abuse and blew kisses in court on the day the trio were jailed. The victim\u2019s mother told the Mail on Sunday she is convinced Abedi was part of the mob who intimidated her and her husband outside court, asserting that she recognised Abedi\u2019s name as soon as it became public following the Manchester attack. Concerned about violent imagery on the social media pages of Ahmed and his associates, the    from Cheshire said she reported them to the   hotline in February last year but believes no action was taken. \u201cNow I see Salman, who clearly hung around with them, has become a suicide bomber. So clearly they didn\u2019t look into what I told them properly,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThey are all friends and are ending up terrorists and rapists. \u201cAt the time it made me think another one could go on to commit a terrorist act and Salman clearly has. \u201d The    private schoolgirl, who had little experience with boys, was lured to a hotel in   Manchester by the attackers who had spent the previous night there celebrating Eid. The victim then became involved in what she believed to be a game of hide and seek, before being forced into a room by the group, who then took turns to rape her after deciding she was \u201ceasy prey\u201d according to the judge. Speaking to the Mail last year on the campaign of harassment waged against the family, in which she said crowds numbering as many as 50 family members and friends of the attackers showed up to offer support to the rapists, the victim\u2019s mother said: \u201cI was frightened throughout and my husband was frightened. There were so many of them and many of them would goad me when I walked past and deliberately try to intimidate us. \u201cIt was scary. If this is what it does to us, then what would this be like for the victim of a rape case?\u201d On Friday, Breitbart London reported that Abedi was part of an   gang who accused teachers of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d for criticising terrorism. During his time at Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester between 2009 and 2011, the Manchester bomber was reportedly part of a group who took offence at a teacher who \u201casked what they thought of someone who would strap on a bomb and blow people up\u201d. According to sources talking to The Times, the \u201cgroup went to complain to their [Religious Education] teacher saying it was Islamophobic\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742561967.0814111}
