Especially with \u201c12 days to go.\u201d This seems like Trump has allowed Dems to see his actual playbook and what he\u2019s going to do in these final days: 1. @sissenberg + I got exclusive access for our new @bw cover, \u201cInside the Trump Bunker, With 12 Days to Go\u201d https://t.co/SW0StqXRep \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 2. Trump camp shared strategy, polling, ads, fundraising + showed off secret data ops, code-named \u201cProject Alamo\u201d https://t.co/SW0StqXRep \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\nTrump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner has emerged as a huge player in all of this: 3. Led by Kushner, Trump team drew data from RNC, Cambridge, FB to make Alamo small-donor money machine w/list of 12 million names, BUT\u2026 \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\nBut Trump knows he\u2019s behind: 4. Trump campaign\u2019s own internal election models show results \u201csimilar to\u201d Nate Silvers \u2014 i.e. they know they\u2019re losing badly. Single digits \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\nTeam Trump does see a path to victory, however, with targeted negative ads: 5. They\u2019ve ID\u2019d 13.5 million persuadable voters in 16 battleground states + say they think they can still win \u2014 but not by going positive. \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\nThis is the quote we\u2019ll be hearing on every cable network today: \u201cWe have three major voter-suppression operations under way\u201d: 6. Trump advisor: \u201cWe have three major voter-suppression operations under way,\u201d including one targeting African-American voters: pic.twitter.com/Oz6UggoWal \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\nThe campaign intends to use targeted Facebook ads to reach these folks, and by their own words, suppress the vote: 7. So Trump camp is targeted Facebook \"dark posts\" at Dem-leaning, but infrequent black voters to discourage them into staying home. \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\nGreen and Issenberg go on to speculate on the future of Trump TV, arguing that what the Trump campaign has built fits perfectly into a new media launch of some sort: 8. Another takeaway from our story is possible plan for future Trump TV network. Trump\\'s spending campaign $ to build massive support list. \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 9. He\\'ll have 12-14 million emails, 2.5 million donors + because paid for with campaign funds, he\\'ll own it \u2014 a future audience for TrumpTV \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 10. Bannon, on the record: \"This is the pipe that makes the connection btwn Trump + the people\u2026connects him to an ever-expanding audience\" \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\nTrump TV is being compared to a U.S version of Britain\u2019s UKIP party: 11. If Trump loses, here\\'s nightmare GOP scenario: he merges with Bannon to start a political-media movement, an American UKIP. Sound crazy? \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 12. Breitbart\\'s London editor, Raheem Kassam, just quit to run for leader of UKIP. His slogan: \"Make UKIP Great Again.\" \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\nAccording to the article, the idea for Trump TV started as a sort of threat to Roger Ailes because of what Trump thought was negative coverage, but it\u2019s morphed into something more realistic: 13. From the piece: \"Trump TV\" was Kushner\\'s idea, posed as a threat to Roger Ailes during primaries when Trump was unhappy w/Fox coverage \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 14. But idea has taken off, and five media companies have expressed interest pic.twitter.com/yod5XhCylY \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 15. Bottom line: Trump ain\\'t walkin away empty-handed, has grifted GOP + donors to build list worth as much as $112 million that he now owns \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\nHere\u2019s the kicker \u2014 The RNC helped build it: Oh, I should add that the RNC also played a big role in all this \u2013> pic.twitter.com/RYusrjZ4sW \\n\u2014 Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 \\n*** Trending'"}, "time": 1742628599.8840144}
