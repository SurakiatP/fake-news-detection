The next time the teenager, already a competitive swimmer, got in the pool, she cut through the water repeating to herself, \u201cI am Debbie Meyer. \u201d That teenager would grow up to become the mother of Katie Ledecky, who on Friday night became the first Olympian since Meyer to complete the 200, 400 and 800 trifecta. Ledecky lowered her    world record in the 800 freestyle by two seconds with a time of 8 minutes 4. 79 seconds. Her 400 split of 4:01. 98 would have won the bronze in the 400 final last Sunday. She finished 11. 38 seconds ahead of the   Jazz Carlin of Britain, who clocked an 8:16. 17. That was   of a second better than the bronze medalist, Boglarka Kapas of Hungary. The slim margin separating second and third threw into sharp relief the dominance of Ledecky, who owns the 13 fastest performances in history. Four years ago, a    Ledecky won the 800 freestyle in 8:14. 63. She and Hungary\u2019s Krisztina Egerszegi are the only swimmers to win gold medals in consecutive Olympics as teenagers. Ledecky started crying as she talked about completing this Olympics cycle by hitting all her goal times. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of a   journey,\u201d Ledecky said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s been so fun. \u201d Before the Games, Ledecky was asked if breaking the   barrier was within her reach. She said she did not believe so. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s achievable,\u201d Ledecky said. And then, almost as an afterthought, she added, \u201cI still say anything is possible. \u201d Before the 800, Ledecky did not have the best night\u2019s sleep. She woke up on Friday with a sore throat that she kiddingly blamed on her roommate, Simone Manuel. After Manuel\u2019s upset victory in the   freestyle on Thursday, Ledecky stayed awake to congratulate her. Manuel said she was shocked when she cracked open the bedroom door around 2 in the morning and was swallowed in an embrace by Ledecky. \u201cShe said I\u2019m not going to sleep until I give you a hug,\u201d Manuel said. \u201cThat really meant a lot to me. \u201d Ledecky, 19, typically expresses more excitement about other people\u2019s success than about her own. After her teammate Leah Smith finished the 800 in 8:20. 95 for sixth, Ledecky   her way over to Smith\u2019s lane and embraced her. \u201cNormally I think a lot of people have to be superdominant, but Katie wants other U. S. girls to be up there on the podium with her,\u201d Smith said. \u201cShe wants challenges. She\u2019s always setting high goals for herself. I think it\u2019s amazing you can want someone who\u2019s racing you to go low. \u201d Ledecky\u2019s coach, Bruce Gemmell, isn\u2019t surprised. \u201cHer biggest internal motivator is getting better, it\u2019s raising the bar,\u201d he said about Ledecky. \u201cIt\u2019s not winning an Olympic medal, it isn\u2019t setting a world record, it wasn\u2019t becoming the best in the world. It\u2019s about setting goals and going after them. \u201d Where does Ledecky go from here? To Stanford, to begin her freshman year, which she put off to train for the Meyer milestone. Her growing legion of admirers includes Kevin Durant, who asked to take a photograph with her after her 200 freestyle victory, and the Olympian with the most medals of all, Michael Phelps.'"}, "time": 1742562156.3662298}
