From the candidate himself to the people who attempt to defend him on television, the default position for anyone who gets a paycheck from Trump is dishonesty. And perhaps no one better personifies this than spokesperson Katrina Pierson, who went so far on CNN this morning that she was threatened with a lawsuit. \\nPierson appeared, along with Democratic strategist Angela Rye, and Pierson began her lies by saying the American middle class is in trouble due to the economic policies of the Obama administration. Rye countered with facts : \u201cI would like to go back to something Katrina mentioned, which was the middle class is hurting. Well I would go to what we\u2019ve learned from the census bureau last year which is the middle class, and poor people, had the best year they\u2019ve had ever since \u2014 in 2015. In quite some time rather. I won\u2019t say ever. It says that real median household income was $56,500 in 2015. That is an increase from $53,700 the year prior. I would also point to you the fact that the unemployment rate is much lower than when President Obama started.\u201d \\nThen host Carol Costello played a video clip of Trump referring to \u201cghettos,\u201d and that led Rye to comment: \u201cPeople like Donald Trump actually take for granted the fact that they have readily available access to capital.\u201d \\nPierson began spitting and sputtering, so Rye told her: \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hear this because the truth burns.\u201d \\nUnable to come up with a reasoned defense, Pierson went personal, alleging that when Rye worked for the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), she \u201cran (it) into the ground.\u201d \\nRye replied: \u201cI ran the CBC into the ground? That\u2019s laughable.\u201d \\nWhen Carol Costello asked Pierson exactly what she was referring to, Pierson told her : \u201cThe record is out there. Look at where the finances were.\u201d \\nRye: \u201cLet me just help you. Good luck with that lie. That\u2019s crazy, what you\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s slander. I could sue you, Katrina.\u201d \\nOnly problem is, if she did sue Pierson, she might not get much money. Pierson, you may recall, was arrested in 1997 for shoplifting and was also accused of illegally collecting unemployment benefits. Those who live in glass houses should never ever throw rocks at others, Katrina. \\nFeatured Image Via CNN Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
