In fact, I\u2019m the author of A Blueprint for Safer Vaccines , an audio guide to saving lives and preventing vaccine injuries and deaths. \\nTo my knowledge, I\u2019m the only independent journalist in the world who is scientifically trained to run an atomic mass spectrometry laboratory, which I\u2019ve been running for nearly a year now and testing the heavy metals content of organic superfoods like cacao , common vaccines as well as the ability of water filers to remove toxic heavy metals . \\nI\u2019m the creator of the Low Heavy Metals Verified standard and I\u2019m the inventor of patent-pending nutritional formulas for capturing heavy metals during digestion and binding with the radioactive isotopes of cesium (such as Cesium-137) to eliminate them from the digestive tract. \\nBoth of these patents are on file with the U.S. patent office awaiting a decision. \\nMy independent atomic elemental analysis of flu vaccines, published in the summer of 2014, proved that flu vaccines contain over 50 ppm mercury, an extremely toxic heavy metal linked to kidney failure, birth defects, spontaneous abortions and neurological damage. \\nThis finding has never been refuted by anyone. \\nIn fact, it was affirmed by vaccine proponents who insisted that it is perfectly safe to inject pregnant women, young children and senior citizens with mercury even though the flu vaccine insert itself readily admits there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to support the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in such groups. \\nBelieve it or not, there are still millions of people, doctors, pharmacists and even journalists who do not yet realize there is a very high concentration of mercury in influenza vaccines given to pregnant women, children and senior citizens. \\nMost people, you see, have been lied to by the media which has stated over and over again that mercury was removed from all vaccines. \\nThat\u2019s simply not true. \\nIt\u2019s still there. And toxic mercury is present in influenza vaccines at a level that\u2019s literally 25,000 times higher than the EPA limit of mercury in drinking water. [7] It\u2019s 100 times higher than the highest level of mercury contamination I\u2019ve ever tested in ocean fish. \\nSee the evidence for yourself \\nTo prove the presence of mercury in influenza vaccines, I\u2019m going to show you four irrefutable pieces of evidence: \\n1) Photographs of a 2013 / 2014 influenza vaccine box admitting, in very small print, to the addition of mercury to the vaccine as a preservative. \\n2) Photographs of the influenza vaccine insert once again repeating the admission that the vaccine contains mercury. \\n3) A screen shot from the Centers for Disease Control website which admits that vaccines still contain the following ingredients: Aluminum, Antibiotics, Egg Protein, Formaldehyde, Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) and Thimerosal, a mercury-containing chemical compound. \\n4) Lab results from the Natural News Forensic Food Lab which confirmed almost precisely the same level of mercury claimed by the manufacturer (GlaxoSmithKline). \\nBefore I show you the irrefutable evidence, there is some good news in all this testing. \\nAs part of this Natural News investigation, I tested several different vaccines, including an HPV vaccine. \\nMercury levels were extremely low in these other vaccines. Only the flu shot contained extremely high mercury levels. \\nInfluenza vaccine box admits safety never established for pregnant women As you can see below, the box for this Flulaval Influenza Virus Vaccine readily admits the use of thimerosal which contains mercury. \\n(Of course, you have to use a magnifying glass to see this.) \\nIn microscopic text on the package insert, it says straight out, \u201cRegister women who receive Flulaval while pregnant in the pregnancy registry by calling 1-888-452-9622.\u201d \\nYet, at the same time, the insert also admits that \u201csafety and efficacy have not been established in pregnant women.\u201d \\nIn other words, this vaccine containing mercury is being promoted for use in pregnant women even when no safety in pregnant women has ever been established. \\nIt\u2019s also important to note that when people are being given flu shots, they are never handed the package or the insert, so they have no opportunity to read any of this information unless they specifically ask for it. \\nIt\u2019s not like a food item with a \u201cNutrition Facts\u201d label. Vaccines are sold in \u201cstealth\u201d mode where patients have no idea what\u2019s in them and no opportunity to read possible warnings. \\nAs further proof of this point, consider the fact that this flu vaccine comes with only one insert, yet it\u2019s a 10-dose vial intended to be injected into 10 different people. \\nClearly, if there\u2019s only one insert but 10 people, then 9 out of 10 people can\u2019t possibly be handed the insert. \\nUnethical medicine administered without informed consent (a violation of medical ethics) \\nIn fact, from a legal perspective, vaccines are routinely injected into people without informed consent. \\nVirtually no one administering vaccines ever explains the risks vs. benefits of vaccines as is required under medical ethics and state medical law. \\nIn nearly all cases, patients are simply hoodwinked and told there are no risks at all. \\nThe second piece of evidence to reveal here is the package insert for the influenza vaccine, a document printed in microscopic text that\u2019s almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. \\nOf course, the intention is that no one ever read this document, because it contains shocking admissions of the total quackery and marketing deception behind flu shots. \\nAs you can see from this snapshot, the package insert readily admits that each vaccine dose \u201ccontains 50 mcg thimerosal (<25 mcg=\u201d\u201d mercury=\u201d\u201d p=\u201d\u201d><25 br=\u201d\u201d mcg=\u201d\u201d mercury=\u201d\u201d> In case you\u2019re wondering, \u201cmcg\u201d means micrograms. A microgram is 1/1000th of a milligram. \\nMercury is toxic at any dose when injected into the body, even in micrograms. There is no such thing as a \u201csafe\u201d form of mercury when injected. \\nIn fact, the ethyl form of mercury used in vaccines is many times more toxic than methyl form once it enters human cells. \\nClick here for a fascinating interview with mercury toxicity expert Dr. Chris Shade who explains this extremely important concept. \\nThe same paragraph shown above also admits the vaccine contains formaldehyde, a potent neurotoxic chemical. \\nVaccine insert admits safety and effectiveness have never been established<25 br=\u201d\u201d mcg=\u201d\u201d mercury=\u201d\u201d> What\u2019s even more astonishing about this insert is that it openly admits the flu shot is a complete medical hoax, backed by nothing but voodoo woo woo faith-based dogma (and clever marketing). \\nHere are actual words from the insert (which is much more lengthy than the snapshot shown above): \\n\u201cThere have been no controlled trials adequately demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Flulaval.\u201d \\n\u201cSafety and effectiveness of Flulaval have not been established in pregnant women, nursing mothers or children.\u201d \\n\u201cSafety and effectiveness of Flulaval in pediatric patients have not been established.\u201d \\n\u201cFlulaval has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.\u201d \\n\u201cDo not administer Flulaval to anyone\u2026 following previous administration of any influenza vaccine.\u201d \\nCDC admits use of mercury, MSG, formaldehyde \\nFor those \u201cmercury denialists\u201d who still can\u2019t believe flu shots given to pregnant women contain high concentrations of toxic mercury, even the CDC reluctantly admits this fact on its own website. \\nHere\u2019s a screen shot from the CDC\u2019s vaccine additives page , which miraculously hasn\u2019t yet been removed from their site: \\n<25 br=\u201d\u201d mcg=\u201d\u201d mercury=\u201d\u201d> Laboratory results from the Natural News Forensic Food Lab \\nThe final piece of irrefutable evidence on all this comes from my own scientific laboratory , where I run ICP-MS instrumentation to test foods, beverages, dietary supplements and other items for heavy metals contamination. \\nI was the first food researcher to document high levels of tungsten in brown rice protein , and I\u2019ve exposed alarming levels of lead in pet treats . I\u2019ve also exposed high lead in ginkgo biloba herbal supplements imported from China . \\nWhen I finally got around to testing vaccines, I was shocked to find over 51,000 ppb mercury in the Influenza Virus Vaccine. \\nWhy was I shocked? Because I don\u2019t recall ever seeing anything run through my ICP-MS instrument with that high a concentration of mercury. \\nThe mercury in this flu vaccine was the HIGHEST concentration of mercury I\u2019ve ever seen in anything, period! \\nAnd this is a product that\u2019s injected directly into the bodies of pregnant women, where mercury goes right into the developing fetus. \\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting is that this finding once again confirms the accuracy of my lab instrumentation because it\u2019s almost in perfect agreement with the level of mercury detailed on the vaccine package insert. \\nLet\u2019s do the math: \\n* Each dose of an influenza vaccine is 0.5 mL in volume * My lab found just over 50 ppm of mercury in the vaccine liquid. * 50 ppm (concentration) x 0.5 mL (volume) equals 25 mcg of mercury. \\nGuess what the package insert says? (Up to) 25 mcg of mercury per dose. Near-perfect agreement, in other words. \\nMy finding of 51 ppm rather than 50 ppm either means my own tests were off by about 2% (which is still considered very accurate for ICP-MS testing) or that GSK put 2% extra mercury into the vaccine. \\nAnd just so you know I actually did the tests, here\u2019s what else we found with other analytes: \\nAluminum: 0.4 ppm Cadmium: zero Lead: zero \\nSo, I can confidently say that the flu vaccine won\u2019t poison you with lead, cadmium or arsenic because it contains none of those things. \\nEven the aluminum level is quite low and not a concern at this very low level. The real problem is just the mercury, at least as far as elements go. \\nWhy won\u2019t vaccine makers remove the mercury? \\nGood question. Everybody knows mercury is toxic to inject into the human body. That\u2019s not debated except by irrational anti-science denialists who refuse to acknowledge the Table of Elements. \\nYou have to wonder: why choose mercury as a preservative? And why do both the CDC and FDA continue to look the other way as an entire branch of modern medicine poisons our women and children with a neurotoxic heavy metal? \\nAnd if vaccine promoters, propagandists and patent holders want the world to accept all their vaccines, why don\u2019t they just remove the mercury and be done with it? \\nIf they take out all the toxic elements, resistance to vaccines would all but evaporate. \\nWhy vaccines are the \u201canti-science\u201d medical voodoo of the modern world Ever wonder why they don\u2019t conduct legitimate clinical trials on flu vaccine efficacy? \\nProbably because they know the results would have to be faked to show any efficacy at all. \\nThat\u2019s what Merck did with its mumps vaccines, according to two former virologists who worked there. \\nThey spiked human blood samples with animal antibodies to fabricate positive results. \\nYep, vaccines work so poorly that even the manufacturers have to fake their own results to show any efficacy. \\nVaccines are the one medicine where no scientific evidence of safety or efficacy is required by anyone: not the FDA, not the CDC and not the media. \\nCongress even passed a law protecting the vaccine industry with absolute legal immunity, even when they manufacture and sell defective products that injure and kill people . \\nHow\u2019s that for medicine we can all trust? \\nThink about it: this is a product that contains multiple neurotoxins in very high concentrations; a product backed by no safety trials or efficacy data; a product linked to numerous serious adverse reactions; and yet a product that enjoys absolute legal immunity thanks to the U.S. government. \\nIf that\u2019s not outright medical quackery, I don\u2019t know what is. \\nFor the record, I\u2019m not an opponent of all vaccines. But I do believe \u2014 as do a rapidly increasing number of other clear-thinking people \u2014 that medicine should not poison our women and children . \\nIt\u2019s time for mercury to be removed from all vaccines, once and for all. Anything less is medical negligence. \\nNew video interview about flu shot failures \\nUltimately, We the People will be victorious in the removal of mercury from all vaccines \u2014 an idea that\u2019s already well accepted across much of Europe. \\nAnd when that day comes, it will be yet another victory for the Natural News fan base, an amazing community of millions of remarkable people working together for the protection of our children, our health and our world. \\nSee my recent video interview with Next News Network\u2019s Gary Franchi on why flu shots are failures:'"}, "time": 1742563178.858864}
