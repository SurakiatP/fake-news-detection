[The GoFundMe page for Nationwide Chauffeured Limo Service recently reached just under $24, 000 in donations, most of which have come from conservatives and other limo service workers, after one of the company\u2019s limos was attacked by a mob of protesters and completely damaged on inauguration day.  The limo, which was owned by Muslim immigrant Muhammad Ashraf, was attacked with bricks and rocks after dropping off a customer, before the vehicle was completely torched \u2014   leaving the driver with minor injuries. \u201cProtesters don\u2019t understand that they are putting innocent people out of business with their actions. I hope you get enough here to replace your limo so that you can continue your small business,\u201d commented one user who donated $25, before tagging Trump\u2019s signature slogan \u201c#MAGA. \u201d \u201cShowing the Left what tolerance looks like,\u201d commented another with his $25 donation, while one $50 donation was signed \u201cFrom a Trump Supporter. \u201d Ashraf, who did not support President Trump during the election, expressed disappointed in the protesters who torched his limousine. \u201cI did not agree with many of the things he said, but that still does not give me the right to go and affect someone\u2019s livelihood,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t think we need to take this [violent] route. \u201d Though nearly $24, 000 has been raised, the damage to Ashraf\u2019s vehicle is reported to cost around $70, 000, which does not include the medical expenses and commission for the driver who was attacked.
