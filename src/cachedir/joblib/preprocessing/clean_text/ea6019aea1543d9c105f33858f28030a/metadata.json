It is a crisis of legitimacy, rooted in the crisis of capitalism, itself.\u201d Obama\u2019s Musings on False Narratives and Fake Stories by BAR executive editor Glen Ford \\n\u201c People no longer believe the fake \u201cnews\u201d and bogus narratives issued by the ruling class and its corporate and military misinformation specialists.\u201d \\nPresident Obama traveled to Berlin last week to browbeat Europeans on why they should continue to play junior partners in Washington\u2019s quest for full spectrum global domination, but kept returning to his post-election obsession: the existential threat posed by \u201cfake news\u201d on social media. It was as if the realization had just dawned on the lame duck president, that his own powers to create \u201cfacts\u201d and manufacture \u201cnews\u201d out of thin air would soon be gone. Without the Clintons in the White House to continue the neoliberal project, history might conclude that the First Black President\u2019s only enduring legacy was...that he was the first Black president. \\nIt\u2019s a question of who gets to decide what\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d or not. Obama fears that what he calls \u201cfake\u201d news begets fake history, which begets the fall of western civilization as the rulers would like people to imagine it. Fake news is a grave danger \u201cin an age where there\u2019s so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,\u201d according to Obama . \u201cIf everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect,\u201d he told the Germans. \\nIt was a magic kind of moment. The legendarily cool and collected Obama had just let out the secret: the ruling class, which he so faithfully serves, has lost control of the social and political narrative, without which it cannot \u201cprotect\u201d its wealth, privilege and power. \\n\u201c When the people come to believe that the president\u2019s narrative is a bunch of \u2018propaganda,\u2019 then future Obamas will no longer be able to protect the Lords of Capital from the pitchforkers.\u201d \\nWas the world\u2019s most powerful individual (until January 20) in despair over Facebook\u2019s failure to erase three or four fictitious, yet ultimately inconsequential, stories from its pages? Of course not. Obama\u2019s problem -- and capitalism\u2019s crisis-- is that people no longer believe the fake \u201cnews\u201d and bogus narratives issued by the ruling class and its corporate and military misinformation specialists. \u201cIf we are not serious about facts and what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not, and particularly in an age of social media when so many people are getting their information in sound bites and off their phones, if we can\u2019t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,\u201d said Obama. \\nThis is the man that told the nation\u2019s assembled bankers, a year after the Greet Meltdown of 2008, \u201cMy administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks.\" When the people come to believe that the president and the corporate media\u2019s narrative -- that the system can be fixed with a little tinkering -- is a bunch of \u201cpropaganda,\u201d rather than \u201cserious argument,\u201d then future Obamas will no longer be able to protect the Lords of Capital from the pitchforkers. \\nLosing control of the narrative is what happened after Michael Brown\u2019s murder in Ferguson, Missouri, when Black youth stopped listening to Obama\u2019s fictitious sermon that racism is not endemic in America, a fake history that candidate Obama had successfully dispensed in his \u201cA More Perfect Union\u201d speech in Philadelphia, in 2008. \\nObama\u2019s targeted handful of phony social media articles generally favored Donald Trump. But the \\nbiggest \u201cfake news\u201d of the recent campaign, promulgated by virtually the entirety of the ruling class ensconced in Hillary Clinton\u2019s Supersized Tent, was that the Russians were scheming to despoil and disrupt the U.S. elections -- crimes Americans commit all by themselves every cycle through massive voter purges and other racist conspiracies. To Clinton and Obama\u2019s horror, this McCarthyite deluge of fake anti-Russian news failed to sway the very \u201cMiddle Americans\u201d that were thought to be the most belligerent, warlike constituency of all. \\n\u201cThe root of the crisis lies in the inability of late stage capitalism to offer anything that will stem the steady decline in the mass of people\u2019s living standards and economic security.\u201d \\nThe Big Tent -- Wall Street, the national security establishment, and their media \u2013 have lost all credibility with the public, and Obama was still shaken by the realization when he traveled to Berlin. Donald Trump and his crowd\u2019s credibility \u2013 their ability to weave a believable narrative \u2013 was nonexistent from the start among half the country, and will shrink even more over time. \\nThe root of the crisis of credibility, which is really a systemic crisis of legitimacy, lies in the inability of late stage capitalism to offer anything that will stem the steady decline in the mass of people\u2019s living standards and economic security. So deep is the decay, every amelioration of public pain would require the dismantling of capitalist structures of power, which is unacceptable to the rulers. \\nOn the most basic level, the U.S. does not have universal health care because capital has entrenched itself in all aspects of health care delivery. The rulers cannot provide affordable housing because Wall Street has financialized the nation\u2019s land and dwellings. Good jobs at living wages are impossible, as long as corporations are empowered to maintain their carefully crafted international supply chain for manufactured goods \u2013 the foundation of corporate globalization. Black America cannot break free of the Mass Black Incarceration State until Black people eject the police, as presently constituted, from their communities, which will also require ejecting the corporate collaborators of the Black Misleadership Class from positions of power. There can be no peace -- and no peace \u201cdividend\u201d for Americans \u2013 while predatory corporations and cartels dictate U.S. foreign policy. The cycle of decline and repression will continue until corporate power is broken and the banks are nationalized. \\nThe rulers offer nothing, because the system is no longer capable of providing relief to the working and \u201csuperfluous\u201d classes (that means most Black folks). They can only spin tales of fantasy and distraction \u2013 fake stories and phony narratives. \\nAmerican \u201cExceptionalism\u201d is \u201cManifest Destiny\u201d with Native American genocide and Black slavery blotted out. It is the falsest narrative of all, tailored for imperial conquest and an \u201cend of history\u201d \u2014 meaning, the end of everyone\u2019s narrative except the imperialist.
