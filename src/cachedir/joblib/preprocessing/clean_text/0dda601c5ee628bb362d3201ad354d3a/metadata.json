P. A. Many of the scientists, environmental lawyers and policy experts who work in E. P. A. offices around the country say the calls are a last resort for workers who fear a nominee selected to run an agency he has made a career out of fighting  \u2014   by a president who has vowed to \u201cget rid of\u201d it. \u201cMr. Pruitt\u2019s background speaks for itself, and it comes on top of what the president wants to do to E. P. A. ,\u201d said John O\u2019Grady, a biochemist at the agency since the first Bush administration and president of the union representing the E. P. A. \u2019s 15, 000 employees nationwide. Nicole Cantello, an E. P. A. lawyer who heads the union in the Chicago area, said: \u201cIt seems like Trump and Pruitt want a complete reversal of what E. P. A. has done. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any other agency that\u2019s been so reviled. So it\u2019s in our interests to do this. \u201d The union has sent emails and posted Facebook and Twitter messages urging members to make the calls. \u201cIt is rare,\u201d said James A. Thurber, the director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other time when people in the bureaucracy have done this. \u201d The campaign is not likely to succeed. Before Friday\u2019s vote, two Democratic senators, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, announced that they would vote for Mr. Pruitt\u2019s confirmation, and only one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, has said she will oppose him. But because Civil Service rules make it difficult to fire federal workers, the show of defiance indicates that Mr. Pruitt will face strong internal opposition to many of his promised efforts to curtail E. P. A. activities and influence. \u201cWhat it means is that it\u2019s going to be a blood bath when Pruitt gets in there,\u201d said Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican former governor of New Jersey and the E. P. A. administrator during the first term of President George W. Bush. Ms. Whitman predicted a standoff between career employees and their politically appointed bosses, noting that Mr. Pruitt would be blocked by legal Civil Service protections from immediately firing longtime employees, but would probably be able to retaliate in other ways, such as shifting them to different jobs. The showdown could embolden the White House and Congress to change federal Civil Service laws. \u201cThe Civil Service is supposed to be a class of experts implementing policy, regardless of politics,\u201d said Myron Ebell, a fellow at the   Competitive Enterprise Institute, who led Mr. Trump\u2019s environmental transition team. \u201cIf they have now become a special interest group pleading their own agenda, then it is probably time to look at reforming the Civil Service laws. \u201d The revolt has also angered supporters of Mr. Pruitt. \u201cThere clearly has been an organized effort to demonize Pruitt, and I think that\u2019s unfair and unfortunate,\u201d said Jeffrey Holmstead, a senior E. P. A. official in the George W. Bush administration who has been mentioned as a possible deputy to Mr. Pruitt. \u201cI don\u2019t remember, in my time, anything like this. But I think that anyone Trump nominated would be targeted. \u201d \u201cWe know that he\u2019ll dismantle Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the U. S. rule, but he\u2019s not going to go in there and start firing people,\u201d said Mr. Holmstead, referring to Obama regulations on climate change and water pollution. Mr. Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, has sued the E. P. A. at least 14 times, often in concert with the nation\u2019s largest fossil fuel companies, to block major environmental regulations. He has questioned   global warming and is a key architect of the national legal effort to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change policies. He has harshly criticized the role of the federal agency, saying much of its authority should be dissolved and left to the states. Mr. Pruitt\u2019s legal views on environmental protection broadly, and the role of the E. P. A. specifically, appear to line up with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign claim that \u201cEnvironmental Protection, what they do is a disgrace. \u201d Within days of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s   Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, and possibly to begin dismantling some E. P. A. offices and programs, people familiar with the White House\u2019s plans said. While it will be impossible to undo most major rules or programs that quickly, the presidential signatures would authorize Mr. Pruitt to cut existing environmental regulations  \u2014   and, eventually, the jobs of many of the people who enforce them. Ms. Cantello said most of her career at the E. P. A. had been focused on water protection, particularly on cleaning pollution in the Great Lakes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid all the work I\u2019ve done will be abandoned,\u201d she said. Ms. Cantello and other longtime agency employees said that while they sometimes chafed under the administration of George W. Bush, who sought to loosen some environmental rules, they did not openly rebel against it  \u2014   nor, they said, did they fear that Mr. Bush and his appointees wanted to eliminate the agency. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for 30 years, and I\u2019ve never called my senator about a nominee before,\u201d said an E. P. A. employee in North Carolina who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of losing her job. The calls to senators come on top of an   protest last week by Chicago E. P. A. employees, and agency workers say that if Mr. Pruitt is confirmed, they intend to amplify their resistance to him, taking their case to the American public. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s just, \u2018call your senator,\u2019\u201d Mr. O\u2019Grady, the union president, said. \u201cWe plan on more demonstrations, more rallies. I think you will see the employees\u2019 union reaching out to N. G. O.s and having alliances with them,\u201d he added, referring to nongovernmental organizations. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at working with P. R. firms. \u201d The White House and E. P. A. did not respond to emailed questions about the employees\u2019 campaign. The E. P. A. emerged as a Republican political target during the Obama administration, after Mr. Obama turned to the agency to muscle through an environmental agenda that could not get through Congress. While Mr. Trump campaigned on slashing   rules on climate change and waterways, his efforts might also be thwarted by Congress. But the E. P. A. is likely to be at the center of his antiregulatory agenda. Experts say it is not surprising that liberal and environmental groups like the Sierra Club have campaigned against Mr. Pruitt. Over 700 former E. P. A. employees have signed a letter to senators opposing his confirmation. The Center for Media and Democracy, a   group, successfully sued the Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s office to release about 3, 000 of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s emails, which they say could reveal more about his ties to fossil fuel companies. An Oklahoma judge ruled Thursday that the emails must be released but gave the attorney general\u2019s office until Tuesday to comply, long enough to avoid roiling the confirmation vote unless Democrats can persuade Senate Republicans to hold off. But former E. P. A. officials said the open rebellion by current employees was extraordinary, especially considering that their resistance could backfire once Mr. Pruitt arrives on the job. \u201cE. P. A. staff are pretty careful. They\u2019re \u201d said Judith Enck, who left the agency last month. \u201cIf people are saying and doing things like this, it\u2019s because they\u2019re really concerned. \u201d Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said on Wednesday that his office had received dozens of calls from people both opposing and supporting Mr. Pruitt\u2019s nomination, including E. P. A. employees, and that he had not yet decided whether to vote for him. \u201cI do have concerns about the Great Lakes,\u201d he said. Mr. O\u2019Grady said that he expected the calls to continue through Friday\u2019s vote. \u201cI pray they don\u2019t dismantle the E. P. A. ,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like Humpty Dumpty  \u2014   very difficult to put back together again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628515.5413778}
