And on a spring afternoon in 1985, there was no reason for Mark Davidson, age 18, to know the   white man waiting for him in an office on Queens Boulevard. Mr. Davidson\u2019s lawyer had instructed him to tell the man his story. So he did. The man was Jimmy Breslin, a columnist, novelist, dramatist and biographer, about halfway through a career that began in the late 1940s. \u201cI was just a kid,\u201d Mr. Davidson, now 50, said on Monday. \u201cA senior at Martin Van Buren. I didn\u2019t know how iconic a news reporter he was at the time. \u201d Mr. Breslin died Sunday at 88, and had been mostly out of the public eye for more than a decade he may be as much of a mystery to a young person today as he was to Mark Davidson and Ruben Blancovich in the 1980s. From the long arc of his public work and life, what remains are deep truths that he told bluntly, and that he saw because he stepped away from the crowd. Before Mark Davidson and Ruben Blancovich were born, Mr. Breslin had written about the funeral of John F. Kennedy as seen by the man who dug the grave. Along the route of a voting rights march in 1965 led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Breslin found an unheated schoolhouse for black children in \u201ca wooden building that was a church when people in Lowndes County wore Confederate uniforms,\u201d he wrote, noting a teacher\u2019s remark that while it did get cold sometimes, \u201cwe hardly ever get near zero. \u201d At the rear of the march was Albert Turner whose pay stub showed $27. 52 in taxes withheld by a government that would not let him vote. \u201cHe is   but he has a little weight on him and he grunted while he walked along,\u201d Mr. Breslin wrote. \u201cSweat showed on the two creases on the back of his neck. He is just a bricklayer from Marion, in nearby Perry County, and he marches with no ceremony, and with his head down, and he was the last one in line yesterday. \u201d In April 1985, Mr. Davidson was arrested near his home in Ozone Park, Queens, by officers from the 106th Precinct and accused of selling two $5 bags of pot to one who was undercover. The officers demanded that he turn over the buy money. Mr. Davidson, who had 26 cents in his pocket, said he had nothing to do with it. \u201cDavidson says when he refused to answer, the man put something on his back which gave him an electric shock,\u201d Mr. Breslin wrote. \u201cDavidson says he turned around and saw the tall man holding something that was black and fit in his hand and had two metal prongs about six inches long. The man then started to apply the prongs to Davidson\u2019s body, front and back, and sent shocks through him repeatedly. \u201d Mr. Davidson\u2019s lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, had already gotten the attention of prosecutors but also contacted Mr. Breslin, then writing for The Daily News. The officers went to prison. \u201cJimmy Breslin was the one that broke the story, and being that it was him reporting it, it made the story more credible,\u201d Mr. Davidson, now a schoolteacher in Atlanta, said. When he showed Mr. Breslin the spots on his stomach and his back where his skin had been fried, \u201cyou could tell he was angry,\u201d Mr. Davidson said. The New York of the 1970s and 1980s was slumping into decay Mr. Breslin, his friend Pete Hamill, and the Times columnist Francis X. Clines were among the leading voices to insist that the people of the city should not be mistaken for its wreckage. \u201cHe went under a desk in his bedroom and brought out some of the books he has been reading,\u201d Mr. Breslin wrote of Ruben Blancovich, then a sixth grader in Public School 206 who started in the third grade able to read some words only in Spanish and a few in English. \u201cA paperback collection of major American poets, \u2018A Christmas Carol\u2019 by Charles Dickens, the novel \u2018April Morning\u2019 by Howard Fast, and a   book, \u2018Colonial Craftsmen,\u2019 with drawings and text by Edwin Tunis. \u201d Mr. Blancovich, who now lives in Albany, went on to Yale and a career in banking and entrepreneurship. He was grateful for the attention Mr. Breslin gave to a school that worked well. He \u201cwas looking at things that the rest of the news wasn\u2019t focusing on,\u201d Mr. Blancovich said. He still has his copy of \u201cThe Red Badge of Courage,\u201d he said, and the clipping of Mr. Breslin\u2019s column.'"}, "time": 1742563537.3937707}
