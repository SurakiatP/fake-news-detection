This Wisconsin town believes it may have the answer. \\n\\nIn recent years, bullying-related suicides account for over 6,000 deaths per year for people ages 15 through 24. This Wisconsin town passed a law that forces parents to pay a fine if their child is a bully. \\n\\nAs the connection between bullying and suicide becomes undeniable, parents, teachers, and students alike are trying to find a solution to this very important issue. Yet, there are too many adults who still see bullying as just another aspect of growing up. It has been proven that bullying is a prevalent problem that leads to many negative effects for it\u2019s victims. Some of these negative effects include depression, fear, lack of motivation to attend school, and suicide. \\n\\nPolice in Shawano, Wisconsin are trying to curb bullying by holding parents accountable if their child is involved in bullying. \\n\\nThe city council of Shawano just passed an ordinance that allows police to intervene when aggression happens. The law applies to anyone under the age of 18 and covers various forms of harassment ranging from taking lunch money to cyberbullying on social media. \\n\\nShawano parents will be warned after the first incident, but if the child\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t change within 90 days, parents will be fined $366. A repeat offender will be fined $681. \\n\\nWhile the majority of parents agree that bullying needs to stop, the new ordinance has raised a lot of controversy. Some critics believe that there could be difficulty distinguishing between playful banter and harassment. But police Chief Mark Kohl assures the public that the ordinance is not generated towards \u2018kids being kids\u2019 and playground banter, but instead towards kids who are meticulously using social media or their words to purposefully hurt others. \\n\\nWhile some parents embrace the fining idea, others disagree believing it will not solve the issue, only burning a hole in the pockets of already stressed out parents. \\n\\nIt is an interesting solution and only time will tell if it works. Feel free to share you own thoughts on the subject. \\n\\nShare this to start a dialogue about the issue of bullying in your community. \\n\\nAriana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacy.com.
