And It\\'s Again Poisoning the Foundations of a Free Society in the US \\nSmears and intimidation vs. free debate, civil liberties and peace Originally appeared at Anti War \\nI\u2019m often taken to task by some of my readers for characterizing the current anti-Russian hysteria as \u201cMcCarthyism.\u201d After all, they say, Sen. Joseph McCarthy was right \u2013 there were, indeed, high-ranking individuals in the US government covertly sympathetic to the Soviet regime. And, yes, we now know that many of these were working directly for Soviet intelligence. \\nThis was the predictable result of our wartime alliance with Russia: combined with the left-wing proclivities of the Roosevelt administration, and the \u201cPopular Front\u201d politics of the Communist Party USA during this period, it\u2019s surprising that Soviet penetration of US government circles wasn\u2019t more extensive than it turned out to be. \\nIn any case, what we are seeing today with the revival of the cold war mindset is in many ways the complete opposite of the \u201cold\u201d McCarthyism: the target may be the same \u2013 Russia as the bogeyman de jour \u2013 but the methods and sources of the neo-McCarthyites are quite different. \\nTo begin with, the \u201cold\u201d McCarthyism was a movement generated from below, and aimed at the elites: the \u201cnew\u201d McCarthyism is a media construct, generated from above and created by the elites. \\nThe average American, while hardly a Putin groupie, is not lying awake at night worrying about the \u201cRussian threat.\u201d The fate of Ukraine, not to mention Crimea, is so far from his concerns that the distance can only be measured in light-years. And when some new scandal breaks as a result of WikiLeaks releasing the emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s inner circle, Joe Sixpack doesn\u2019t think \u201cOh, that just proves Julian Assange is a Kremlin toady!\u201d WikiLeaks is merely confirming what Joe already knew: that Washington is a cornucopia of corruption. \\nThe Acela corridor elite, on the other hand, does lie awake at night wondering how they can pull off a regime change operation that will eliminate the \u201cthreat\u201d represented by Putin once and for all. Ever since the Russian leader started mocking Washington\u2019s hegemonic pretensions, criticizing the US invasion of Iraq, and pointing out how US-funded Syrian \u201crebels\u201d are merely jihadists in \u201cmoderate\u201d clothing, Putin has been in their crosshairs \u2013 and the propaganda war has been relentless. \\nThis barrage has gone into overdrive with the launching of the Clinton campaign\u2019s effort to smear Donald Trump as a Kremlin \u201cpuppet. \u201d You have to go all the way back to the earliest days of our Republic, when pro-British supporters of Alexander Hamilton were sliming the Jeffersonian Democrats with accusations that they were agents of the French revolutionaries, to come up with the historical equivalent of Hillary\u2019s \u201cyou\u2019re a puppet\u201d charges directed at Trump. And the media, being an auxiliary of the Clinton campaign, has been filled with even more virulent screeds purporting to \u201cprove\u201d Trump is the Manchurian candidate . \\nOne way in which the new McCarthyism is very much like the old is that it threatens to poison the intellectual atmosphere in this country, endangering the very foundations of our free society and academic standards of free inquiry and debate. Emblematic of this trend is a tweet authored by Dan Drezner , professor of international relations at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and a foreign affairs columnist at theWashington Post, in which he commented on a talk he heard at the Valdai conference, a regular event held in Russia focusing on Russo-American relations: \\n\u201cAt Valdai, John Mearsheimer says the Chinese and Russians love his realism. \u2018I\u2019m much more comfortable in Moscow than Washington!\u2019\" \\nMearsheimer is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of political science at the University of Chicago, the author of six books, and the leading theoretician of the school of international relations known as \u201coffensive realism.\u201d He is, in short a scholar of some renown \u2013 and yet Drezner, considerably lower on the academic totem pole, feels empowered to slime him as somehow disloyal. How did we come to this sad state of affairs? \\nThe poisoning of a society with propaganda used to take some time: today, the process is much faster, due to technological innovation, and especially the rise of the Internet and the growth of social media. In the old days, the McCarthyites had to rely on print media and radio to smear those \u201cpinko college professors\u201d and drive them out of academia. Today, someone like Drezner can sign in to their Twitter account and snark about how John Mearsheimer is more at home in Moscow and Beijing than in the good ol\u2019 US of A, and his thousands of Twitter followers get the idea \u2013 that Mearsheimer is somehow anti-American \u2013 in an instant (and in only twenty words!). \\nThe \u201cold\u201d McCarthyism was dangerous because, in some cases, people were targeted unfairly: anybody with dissident views was suspect, and especially anyone with vaguely left-wing opinions. And McCarthyism, which in its original form saw the main danger to America to be internal, soon morphed into something else entirely: a movement that sought a military confrontation with the Soviet Union. Indeed, it was McCarthyism that was the bridge that allowed neoconservative interventionists to invade the conservative movement and displace the \u201cisolationism\u201d of the Old Right. \\nThe new McCarthyism poses new dangers that are, perhaps, more virulent than the old version and will have more immediate consequences. The above-mentioned smear of Prof. Mearsheimer encapsulates what the dangers are to academia: in the 1950s, left-wing professors had at least some protection from populist McCarthyites in that academics tended to jealously guard their turf and protect their own from outside incursions. Today, with the elites pushing Russophobia, those protections fall by the wayside. \\nFurthermore, the political class, where the new McCarthyism is rampant, has power \u2013 that is, it can translate its prejudices into policy more readily than any mass movement such as the one led by \u201cTail-gunner Joe.\u201d If Hillary Clinton and her advisors really believe that Putin is out to defeat her and elect her opponent, then what can we expect will happen to US-Russian relations if and when she\u2019s elected? \\nAnd while the American people aren\u2019t exactly up in arms over the prospect of a \u201cRed Dawn\u201d scenario unfolding in the streets of America\u2019s cities, the \u201cmainstream\u201d media\u2019s longstanding anti-Russian crusade is clearly having an effect. A Pew poll shows that anti-Russian sentiment in the United States rose \u201cfrom 43% to 72% from 2013 to 2014.\u201d The \u201ctrickle down\u201d effects of war propaganda work just as effectively as the \u201ctrickle-up\u201d model, if not more so. \\nThe real world consequences of a conflict with Russia, a nuclear-armed state, are fearsome to even contemplate: the political class in this country is playing a dangerous game of chicken, and they\u2019re playing it with our lives and the lives of every person on earth. \\nAside from the prospect of World War III, the effects of the new McCarthyism will be to distort our politics, infect our culture, and threaten our constitutional rights as Americans. It is entirely possible that a new witch-hunt will be launched by the Russia-haters in our midst, with a revived \u201cUn-American Activities Committee\u201d replete with congressional hearings, as well as \u201cinvestigations\u201d by law enforcement of \u201cpro-Russian\u201d\u201csubversive\u201d activities. With the media acting as a cheerleading section for these official and unofficial arbiters of political correctness, our future as a free society will be increasingly in doubt. \\nFinally, the new McCarthyism underscores the cynicism, opportunism, and downright viciousness of our political class, and especially the media, which has done nothing to question and everything to bolster the Russophobic propaganda put out there by self-serving lobbyists and politicians. It truly is a sickening sight, made all the more so by the self-professed \u201cliberalism\u201d of those who are in the vanguard of this revolting trend. \\nWhat these folks should remember is that the \u201cold\u201d McCarthyism was in large part a reaction to the \u201c Brown scare \u201d of the Roosevelt era, when \u201cisolationist\u201d conservatives were smeared as \u201cagents of Hitler,\u201d driven out of their jobs, and in some instances charged with \u201csedition.\u201d This bout of war hysteria was driven, first of all, by the Communist Party and its media contingent, which had become more-patriotic-than-thou when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union and the Communist line on the war changed overnight. However, when the world situation changed again, and the Soviets were in Washington\u2019s sights, the tables were abruptly turned \u2013 and Sen. McCarthy\u2019s crusade took off. \\nThe same thing can happen again. If the consequences of the new McCarthyism come to fruition in an armed conflict with Russia, or even a nuclear exchange, as Americans emerge from the radioactive wreckage they\u2019ll be looking for someone to blame \u2013 and scapegoats won\u2019t be that hard to find.
