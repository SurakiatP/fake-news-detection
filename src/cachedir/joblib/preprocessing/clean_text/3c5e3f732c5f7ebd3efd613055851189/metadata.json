So they want voters to believe that Hillary is just as bad. And in pursuit of that goal they have a very powerful ally \u2014 lazy people. \u201cPeople who like to say, \u2018they\u2019re all bad.\u2019 Because when you say that, you don\u2019t have to do any homework. Say, \u2018they\u2019re all the same,\u2019 and you can sound justifiably jaded by the entire process when, really, you just don\u2019t know anything.\u201d \\nFinally, Maher directed his comments at millennial voters who he said are wrongly obsessed with \u201cbullshit\u201d trivia: \u201cI am so tired of hearing that Hillary doesn\u2019t seem genuine. Grow the fuck up.\u201d \\nExactly! Hillary isn\u2019t \u201cgenuine?\u201d So would you rather have a man who is a genuine serial sexual assaulter of women and a threat to the national and economic security of the United States? Those of us who care about what happens in the future because we love our children need to put aside our petty picking at a woman who has devoted her life to helping others and elect her as President. If we fail to do so, future generations will never forgive us. \\nFeatured Image Via YouTube Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
