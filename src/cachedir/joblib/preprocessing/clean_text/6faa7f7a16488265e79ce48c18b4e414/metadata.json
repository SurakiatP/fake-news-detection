I\u2019ve heard people claim they spoke to God many times in my life, and until now, there was always some personal agenda involved. When I was a kid, I had relatives tell me God wanted me to have a crew cut. Then there were the more famous situations like Oral Roberts saying that if his flock didn\u2019t send him ten million dollars by a specified date, God would kill him, personally. \\nThen you had guys like Ted Haggard. I\u2019m pretty sure God told him it wasn\u2019t a good idea to be snorting meth off the units of male prostitutes while he was the pastor of an evangelical megachurch and spiritual advisor to the likes of George W. Bush, but if so, God\u2019s words went unheeded. \\nNot so with the infamous Flip shitlord. \\n\u00e2\\x80\\x9cAnd I said, \u00e2\\x80\\x98Who is this?\u00e2\\x80\\x99 So, of course, \u00e2\\x80\\x98it\u00e2\\x80\\x99s God,\u00e2\\x80\\x99\u00e2\\x80\\x9d he told Filipino journalists late Thursday. \\n\u00e2\\x80\\x9cSo, I promise God,\u00e2\\x80\\x9d he continued, \u00e2\\x80\\x9cNot [to] express slang, cuss words and everything. So you guys hear me right always because [a] promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people.\u00e2\\x80\\x9d God\u2019s servant on Earth, Rodrigo Duterte, contemplating the sound of one hand killing all the drug lords. \\nNow there\u2019s a man with his priorities straight. He identifies the speaker, and makes his promise, publicly, to God and his people, that he will obey. Of course, all fascists believe in a natural hierarchy, so his obedience just makes sense. \\nAn important thing to note is, when God speaks, what he doesn\u2019t say is just as important as what he said. He told Duterte, \u201cstop cussing.\u201d Nothing more. \\nThank goodness he did not say \u201cstop killing criminals.\u201d I was pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t, but you never know. What a relief\u2026 \\nOf course, not everyone is theologically adept, i.e. the author of the WaPo article. She took to Twitter to make some heretical and thoroughly unfair remarks. Err, to quote @astroehlein , \"Did God mention the death squads?\" https://t.co/QezjfCweEH \\n\u2014 Emily Rauhala (@emilyrauhala) October 28, 2016 \\nNo Emily, God did not mention the death squads, and any true believer knows this means he approves of them. \\nWhere in the Holy Bible does it say you\u2019re supposed to allow savage drug kingpins to wage war in your streets, killing innocents by the thousands, just so they can decide who gets to sell poison to your people and in what location? I\u2019ve never read that part. \\nI cannot confirm whether or not Emily Rauhala is a Jew, but she\u2019s WaPo\u2019s \u201cChina Correspondent,\u201d and her Twitter timeline reads like someone with a personal vendetta against the fantastic leader of The Philippines. \\nWhatever her problem is, she\u2019d better get a handle on it, because in ten days we\u2019re electing a Great Christian here as well!'"}, "time": 1742564265.5042865}
