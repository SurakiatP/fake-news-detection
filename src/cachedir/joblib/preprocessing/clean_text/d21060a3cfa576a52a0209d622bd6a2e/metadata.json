The Trump family lied about this fact and conspired to cover it up for the duration of the election. This comes at a supremely bad time for Trump, who recently made Melania a campaign centerpiece \u2013 including a much publicized speech on\u2026 you guessed it\u2026 immigration. \\nHere\u2019s what the AP found : \\nThe documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa. \\nIt is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump. The government can seek to revoke the U.S. citizenship of immigrants after the fact in cases when it determines a person willfully misrepresented or concealed facts relevant to his naturalization. But the government effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes. \\nAccording to the documents, Melania made roughly $20,000 illegally before getting her visa \u2013 only slightly less money in seven weeks than the average undocumented worker Trump disparages as \u201cmoochers\u201d make in a year . \\nWhile existing standards mean Melania would likely remain a U.S. citizen despite her previous violations, her husband\u2019s plans to crack down on illegal immigration might be working against her. Trump has long held that people who \u201ccheated\u201d to get into the United States illegally should be moved to the \u201cback of the line.\u201d Would he include his wife in that sweeping category? \\nOf course, Melania Trump should not be deported over a technicality in her early immigration status. However, her husband might want to think about that fact when he screams at rallies about rounding up families of Hispanic immigrants and shipping them out of the country. Melania is living proof that the immigration issue in this country isn\u2019t exactly cut-and-dry. Not that Trump is known for any semblance of nuance. \\nFeatured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562154.9065466}
