The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey in Newark overturned a lower court\u2019s conviction of the   Dharun Ravi, on several counts of bias intimidation because of a change in state law. The court called for a new trial of Mr. Ravi on 10 other counts that included invasion of privacy and tampering with evidence. Mr. Ravi was convicted in 2012 in a case that drew international attention to the bullying of gay teenagers after Mr. Clementi jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge. Mr. Clementi\u2019s life and death were taken up by advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and the case delved into the risks that are sometimes associated with coming out as Mr. Clementi had struggled with questions about his sexuality. Mr. Clementi\u2019s suicide at age 18 came just days after he learned that Mr. Ravi had used a webcam to spy on him and had used social media to invite others to watch a sexual encounter in the dormitory room Mr. Clementi shared with Mr. Ravi. Mr. Ravi was not charged in his roommate\u2019s death, and Mr. Clementi did not leave behind an explanation of what drove him to kill himself. Some of the charges on which Mr. Ravi was convicted fell under a state statute on bias intimidation that was unlike any other in the United States. The statute said defendants could be convicted if their victims \u201creasonably believed\u201d that they were harassed or intimidated because of a characteristic such as race or sexual orientation. But last year, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the   law was unconstitutional. The court threw out those charges and concluded that the evidence that prosecutors presented to prove them had \u201ctainted the jury\u2019s verdict on the remaining charges\u201d and deprived Mr. Ravi of a fair trial. Lawrence S. Lustberg, a lawyer who argued that the   law was unconstitutional, said that the appeals court had little choice but to decide that the convictions reached using that statute were wrong. Having done that, it was \u201cpretty straightforward\u201d to conclude \u201cthat the whole trial was deeply infected by that error,\u201d Mr. Lustberg said. The Middlesex County prosecutor\u2019s office will now have to decide whether to appeal or to try Mr. Ravi again on the other 10 charges. After apologizing for his actions, Mr. Ravi served 20 days in jail on some of the charges and was ordered to pay $10, 000 to a program to help victims of hate crimes. But Mr. Clementi\u2019s parents, Joe and Jane, rejected the \u201c  apology\u201d as a \u201c  piece. \u201d They also criticized the judge, Glenn Bermen of State Superior Court, for not sentencing Mr. Ravi to jail for bias crimes, saying he missed a chance to highlight their seriousness. A spokesman for the Middlesex prosecutor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Ravi\u2019s lawyer, Steven D. Altman, also did not reply to requests for comment on Friday. Joe and Jane Clementi responded to the ruling with a statement released through the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which they founded to help end bullying. \u201cIn light of today\u2019s decision, we will do what we encourage all people to do before they push that send button, and that is to pause and consider the implications of their message,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDoes it encourage and build someone up or does it destroy and harm another person? Our world moves very fast which pushes us to be impulsively spontaneous and sometimes harsh. \u201d Reached by phone on Friday evening, Ms. Clementi said the prosecutors told her that they would notify her family next week about how they would proceed. She said she did not have an opinion on whether the litigation should continue. \u201cSocial media is a great tool, but it can be used for good and it can be used for harm and destruction,\u201d Ms. Clementi said. \u201cThis just fosters my desire to keep moving and make sure that other people hear this and know this. \u201d The appeals court judges did not minimize their disapproval of what Mr. Ravi had done. \u201cThe social environment that transformed a private act of sexual intimacy into a grotesque voyeuristic spectacle must be unequivocally condemned in the strongest possible way,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cThe fact that this occurred in a university dormitory, housing   college students, only exacerbates our collective sense of disbelief and disorientation,\u201d it continued. \u201cAll of the young men and women who had any association with this tragedy must pause to reflect and assess whether this experience has cast an indelible moral shadow on their character. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561812.15099}
