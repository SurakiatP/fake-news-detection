Yet even as she savaged Donald J. Trump as an existential threat to American democracy, a week before Republicans plan to nominate him for president in Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton set off on a delicate balancing act of her own. She waded with care into the thickets of national reckonings over police violence and violence against the police, hoping to position herself as an unlikely agent of harmony. And in an uncharacteristic admission, Mrs. Clinton assumed responsibility for at least a small measure of the fractiousness in the national discourse. \u201cI cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions haven\u2019t sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of our progress,\u201d she told a small audience that crowded beneath a grand ceiling here. \u201cSo I recognize I have to do better, too. \u201d Though Mrs. Clinton has for weeks stressed unity as the binding theme of her campaign  \u2014   making speeches in front of \u201cStronger Together\u201d signs  \u2014   the staging on Wednesday was particularly unsubtle. She immediately invoked President Lincoln, quoting from his speech on June 16, 1858. She spoke slowly and sternly, as if narrating a documentary, railing against a litany of national hardships: gun violence, economic inequality, an overreliance on the police to remedy societal ills. She suggested reassuringly that America had overcome much more than its recent pain and political fury. \u201cThe challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln\u2019s time. Not even close,\u201d she said. \u201cBut recent events have left people across America asking hard questions about whether we are still a house divided. \u201d For a candidate not known for soaring oratory, and often not especially comfortable pursuing it, the venue was something of a risky choice, inviting comparisons to some of the most stirring speakers in American history. Nearly a century and a half after Lincoln condemned slavery here, Senator Barack Obama stood before the Capitol in February 2007 to announce his bid for president. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides had billed this speech as a major address, hoping to build on remarks last week before black clergy members in Philadelphia, when she urged white Americans to \u201cdo a better job of listening when   talk. \u201d She did touch on the deaths of black men in Louisiana and in Minnesota, and the deaths of five police officers in Dallas, reciting all of their names. She also cited the deaths of five Latinos in     episodeslast week. But during her   remarks, Mrs. Clinton trained her attention largely on Mr. Trump, whose campaign she called \u201cas divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes. \u201d In perhaps her most zealous flourish, she noted that Mr. Trump had suggested Tuesday night that he could relate to systemic bias against black Americans because \u201ceven against me, the system is rigged. \u201d \u201cEven this, the killing of black people by police, is somehow about him,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. As the Republican Party prepares to nominate Mr. Trump next week, Mrs. Clinton seemed inclined to highlight the consequences of that choice at every opportunity. She mocked Mr. Trump\u2019s reference last week to \u201cArticle 12\u201d of the Constitution, which does not exist, and wondered about giving him access to the levers of power. \u201cImagine if he had not just Twitter and cable news to go after his critics and opponents, but also the I. R. S.  \u2014   or for that matter, our entire military,\u201d she said. As she moves to portray Mr. Trump as a purveyor of national chaos, Mrs. Clinton is also seeking to bridge a divide in her own party. Her campaign is hopeful that the   endorsement from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Tuesday will help bring Democrats together in earnest before the party\u2019s convention in Philadelphia in two weeks. Implicit in her comments on Wednesday was a plea for empathy, even for political opponents  \u2014   a striking gesture from Mrs. Clinton, who has long inspired intense partisan passions and was criticized last year for saying in a debate that Republicans were the \u201cenemy\u201d she was proudest to have made. \u201cLet\u2019s put ourselves in the shoes of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, who speaks often of her family\u2019s   roots. (Her father owned a small drapery business in Chicago.) \u201cWe may disagree on the causes and the solutions to the challenges we face,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut I believe, like anyone else, they\u2019re trying to figure out their place in a   America. \u201d Wrapping up, Mrs. Clinton strayed from her prepared text to describe a song from the musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d which she saw for the third time on Tuesday, telling the crowd that history had its eyes on how Americans respond to this moment. Then she quoted Lincoln once more. \u201cIf we do the work, we will \u2018cease to be divided,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe, in fact, will be indivisible  \u2014   with liberty and justice for all. And we will remain  \u2014   in President Lincoln\u2019s words  \u2014   the last, best hope of earth. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564081.521034}
