He\u2019s also a potential VP candidate. \\nThe growing chatter about his key role in the Trump campaign coincides with his new book, \u201cThe Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies,\u201d scheduled for release July 12. A vice presidential trial balloon certainly would drive interest in the text, and possibly juice sales. \\nHe teamed up on the book with Michael Ledeen, a prominent member of a group of scholars and former government officials that helped shape the views of many top national security leaders in the George W. Bush administration. \\nFollow us: @politico on Twitter | Politico on Facebook \\nMichael Ledeen \\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \\nWork in the United States[edit] \\nIn the early 1980s, Ledeen appeared before the newly established Senate Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism, alongside former CIA director William Colby, author Claire Sterlingand former Newsweek editor Arnaud de Borchgrave. Both Ledeen and de Borchgrave worked for the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University at the time.[6]All four testified that they believed the Soviet Union had provided for material support, training and inspiration for various terrorist groupings.[7] Ledeen was involved in the Iran\u2013Contra affair as a consultant of National Security Advisor Robert C. McFarlane. Ledeen vouched for Iranian intermediary Manucher Ghorbanifar. In addition, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, officials of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the Central Intelligence Agency to arrange meetings with high-ranking Iranian officials, whereby U.S supported Iranians would be given weapons by Israel, and would proceed to negotiate with Hizbollah for the release of hostages in Lebanon.[8] Ledeen\u2019s own version of the events is published in his book, Perilous Statecraft.[9] \\nYellowcake forgery allegations[edit] \\nMain article: Niger uranium forgeries \\nAccording to a September 2004 article by Joshua Micah Marshall, Laura Rozen, and Paul Glastris in Washington Monthly:[10]\u201cThe first meeting occurred in Rome in December, 2001. It included Franklin, Rhode, and another American, the neoconservative writer and operative Michael Ledeen, who organized the meeting. (According to UPI, Ledeen was then working for Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith as a consultant.) Also in attendance was Ghorbanifar and a number of other Iranians.\u201d \\nColleagues Andrew McCarthy and Mark R. Levin have defended Ledeen, writing[11] \\nUp until now, the fiction recklessly spewed by disgruntled intelligence-community retirees and their media enablers\u2014some of whom have conceded that the claim is based on zero evidence\u2014has been that Michael had something to do with the forged Italian documents that, according to the Left\u2019s narrative, were the basis for President Bush\u2019s \u201clie\u201d in the 2003 State of the Union Address that Saddam Hussein had obtained yellowcake uranium (for nuclear-weapons construction) in Africa. \\nIraq War advocacy[edit] \\nRegarding the \u201cpre-emptive\u201d invasion of Iraq, in 2002 Ledeen criticized the views of former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, writing:[12] He fears that if we attack Iraq \u201cI think we could have an explosion in the Middle East. It could turn the whole region into a cauldron and destroy the War on Terror.\u201d \\nOne can only hope that we turn the region into a cauldron, and faster, please. If ever there were a region that richly deserved being cauldronized, it is the Middle East today. If we wage the war effectively, we will bring down the terror regimes in Iraq, Iran, and Syria, and either bring down the Saudi monarchy or force it to abandon its global assembly line to indoctrinate young terrorists. \\nThat\u2019s our mission in the war against terror. Ledeen specifically called for the deposition of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime by force in 2002: So it\u2019s good news when Scowcroft comes out against the desperately needed and long overdue war against Saddam Hussein and the rest of the terror masters.[12] and: Question #2: Okay, well if we are all so certain about the dire need to invade Iraq, then when do we do so? Ledeen: Yesterday[13] Ledeen\u2019s statements prior to the start of the Iraq war such as \u201cdesperately needed and long overdue war against Saddam Hussein\u201d and \u201cdire need to invade Iraq\u201d caused Glenn Greenwald to label his later statement that he \u201copposed the military invasion of Iraq before it took place\u201d to be an \u201coutright lie\u201d.[14] However, Ledeen maintains these statements are consistent since: \u201cI advocated\u2014as I still do\u2014support for political revolution in Iran as the logical and necessary first step in the war against the terror masters.\u201d[15] \\nViews on Iran[edit] \\nAlthough Ledeen was in favor of invading Iraq, he also believes that Iran should have been the first priority in the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d[16] The New York Times describes Ledeen\u2019s views as \u201ceverything traces back to Tehran\u201d.[16] Ledeen\u2019s phrase, \u201cfaster, please\u201d has become a signature meme in Ledeen\u2019s writings (it is currently the title of his blog on the Pajamas Mediawebsite) and is often referenced by neoconservative writers advocating a more forceful and broader \u201cwar on terror.\u201d In 1979, Ledeen was one of the first Western writers to argue thatAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a \u201cclerical fascist\u201d, and that while it was legitimate to criticize the Shah\u2019s regime, if Khomeini seized power in Iran the Iranian people would suffer an even greater loss of freedom and women would be deprived of political and social rights. He presently believes that \u201cNo one in the West has yet supported Iranian democratic organizations\u201d and that \u201caggressive support for those Iranians who wish to be free\u201d would most likely work in ending the clerical government.[17] \\nAccording to Justin Raimondo, Ledeen \u201cholds up Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright as patsies for Khomeini\u2014who supposedly believed that the Ayatollah overthrew Shah Reza Pahlavibecause the Iranian government was \u2018excessively repressive and intolerant.\u2019 While it would not do to come right out and deny the savagery of the Shah\u2019s legendary SAVAK secret police, Ledeen informs us that, under the monarch\u2019s beneficent rule, \u2018Iran had become too modern, too tolerant\u2014especially of women and of other religious faiths\u2014and too self-indulgent. The shah had Westernized Iran\u2019\u2014except, perhaps, in his prisons, where the ancient methods of torture were routinely employed on dissidents of all sorts.\u201d[18] \\nLedeen is currently against both an invasion of Iran or air-strikes within the country.[17][19] He has argued that the latter may eventually become necessary if negotiations with the Iranian government fail, but it would only be the least bad option of many options and it would lead to many negative unforeseen consequences.[19] The New York Times has called Ledeen\u2019s skepticism towards military action against Iran surprising given his opposition to the regime.[16] In October 2007, Ledeen argued that:\u201cThose who believe that I am part of some \u201chawkish gang\u201d just haven\u2019t noticed that I am opposed to invasion or bombing the nuclear facilities. My fear is that, by failing to promote a non-violent democratization of Iran, we make large-scale violence much more likely.\u201d \\n\u201cIn any event, time will tell, and I share the fear of most commenters [sic] that we will indeed arrive at a horrible choice between Iran with the bomb, or bomb Iran, as Sarkozy and Kouchner have put it. And if that happens, it will demonstrate a terrible failure on the part of the West, including the United States, to craft a serious Iran policy lo these many years.\u201d[17]'"}, "time": 1742564435.7512076}
