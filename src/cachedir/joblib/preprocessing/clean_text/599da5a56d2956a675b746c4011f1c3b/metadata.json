The presidential race has immigrants from around the world racing to the U.S.-Mexican border, as the cartels exploit a powerful narrative: get into the U.S. while you still can. \\n\u201cSmugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there\u2019s a chance,\u201d said Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., whose views were echoed by another agent in Texas. \\n\u201cPeople think if one candidate wins, certain things will happen, like a giant wall being built and then they can never get through,\u201d said Chris Cabrera, an agent in the Rio Grande Valley. \u201cAnother faction believes that if the other candidate wins, they\u2019ll get amnesty if they\u2019re here by a certain date.\u201d \\nThose two competing narratives\u2013triggered by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, respectively\u2013are driving immigration numbers the Border Patrol hasn\u2019t seen in years in some sectors. \\n\u201cWe are overwhelmed,\u201d said a veteran agent in McAllen, Texas. \u201cWe are seeing 800 to 1,000 apprehensions every night.\u201d \\nIn fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wide\u2013and 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming to be from Africa and Asia also is up. \\n{snip} \\nThe poverty and violence plaguing many of these countries helps push immigrants north, Beeson said. Pull factors include available and good-paying jobs in the U.S. and immigration policy that provides work permits and freedom for immigrants while the courts adjudicate their \u2018asylum\u2019 claim. \\n\u201cWhen you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is\u2013\u2018I\u2019m here for asylum, I can\u2019t go home because they\u2019ll kill me.\u2019 . . . When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story,\u201d said Cabrera. \u201cOnce they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, we\u2019ll never see them again.\u201d \\nDel Cueto said the agents are \u201cnot getting any backing\u201d from D.C. and \u201cwe need to start enforcing every single immigration law we have on the books.\u201d \\nDel Cueto and Cabrera belong to the National Border Patrol Council, which represents the Border Patrol\u2019s 18,000 field agents who are prohibited from talking openly to the media.'"}, "time": 1742628454.0263443}
