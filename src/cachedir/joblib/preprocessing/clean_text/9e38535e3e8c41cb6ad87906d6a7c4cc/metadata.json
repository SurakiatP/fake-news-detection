Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, privately expressed dismay on Wednesday over Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly aggressive attacks on the judiciary, calling the president\u2019s criticism of independent judges \u201cdemoralizing\u201d and \u201cdisheartening. \u201d The remarks by Judge Gorsuch,  chosen  by Mr. Trump last week to serve on the nation\u2019s highest court, came as the president lashed out at the federal appellate judges who are considering a challenge to his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The president called their judicial proceedings \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and described the courts as \u201cso political. \u201d Those remarks followed Mr. Trump\u2019s weekend Twitter outburst in which he derided a Seattle district court judge who blocked his travel ban as a \u201c  judge\u201d whose \u201cridiculous\u201d ruling would be overturned. Judge Gorsuch expressed his disappointment with Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the judiciary in a private conversation with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, as he paid courtesy calls on Capitol Hill to build support for his confirmation. An account of the discussion was confirmed by a White House adviser working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s public feud with the judiciary. Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday, the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even \u201ca bad high school student would understand. \u201d \u201cThis is highly unusual,\u201d said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal judge who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University. \u201cMr. Trump is shredding longstanding norms of etiquette and interbranch comity. \u201d Presidents have traditionally tried to refrain from even appearing to intervene in court cases that concern them or their policies, or from impugning the motives and qualifications of jurists charged with deciding them, according to judges and legal experts from across the political spectrum. The tradition is important to preserving the separation of powers that is a pillar of American democracy, establishing an independent judiciary to serve as a check on the executive branch, they argued. Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetorical battle with the judiciary may also end up harming his cause in a case that may end up before the Supreme Court, by potentially stiffening the resolve of judges who feel their independence is under attack. Mr. McConnell called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201cextremely   and  \u201d because of their potential to sway judges to rule against Mr. Trump. \u201cJudges who hear criticism of this sort are not going to be inclined to knuckle under it\u2019s going to stiffen their spines to be even more independent,\u201d said Mr. McConnell, who was nominated to his judgeship by President George W. Bush. Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia devoted to explaining the Constitution, said there was a rich history of presidents strongly criticizing judges on matters of law. \u201cBut those criticisms were based on constitutional disagreements about the rulings, and it\u2019s hard to think of a president who has challenged the motives of specific judges by name repeatedly, especially before a case is decided, or used the same kind of invective as Mr. Trump has toward the court,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cJudicial independence is a fragile and crucial achievement of American constitutionalism,\u201d he added, \u201cand it depends on the public seeing the judiciary as something more than politicians in robes. \u201d Yet Mr. Trump, who as president has the power to nominate members of the federal judiciary, appears bent instead on portraying independent judges who hold the fate of his travel ban in their hands as partisans who refuse to give him the power to which he is entitled to protect the nation. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to call a court biased, so I won\u2019t call it biased,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cBut courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what\u2019s right. \u201d Mr. Trump, who opened his remarks to law enforcement officers reciting the passage of the United States code that gives the president the power to restrict immigration whenever he deems the influx of foreigners detrimental to the country, said he had watched \u201cin amazement\u201d Tuesday night as a   federal appeals panel heard arguments on his executive order and the limits of presidential power in cases of national security. \u201cI listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s sad. I think it\u2019s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. \u201d His comments came the morning after a lively, roughly hourlong hearing  \u2014   the audio of which was carried live on national television  \u2014   during which three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit expressed skepticism about the arguments of a Justice Department lawyer defending Mr. Trump\u2019s order. Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the travel ban on Friday, and the appeals court is considering whether to uphold that action, with a ruling expected as early as Thursday. Mr. Trump took aim at one of the judges without specifying which, saying, \u201cI will not comment on the statements made by, certainly one judge. \u201d The panel was made up of Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Richard R. Clifton, named by Mr. Bush and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, nominated by President Barack Obama. \u201cIf these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they\u2019d do what they should be doing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad. \u201d By contrast, he lavished praise on Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, a federal district judge in Boston who last week ruled that the travel ban could stay in place. \u201cRight on  \u2014   they were perfect,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Judge Gorton\u2019s comments. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize or seek to apply pressure to the courts Mr. Obama admonished Supreme Court justices as they sat before him in the House chamber during his 2010 State of the Union address for their ruling in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case that allowed corporations to spend freely to influence elections. John Yoo, a former counsel to Mr. Bush, argued that Mr. Trump was using a potent weapon that has been used throughout history  \u2014   the presidential prerogative to provoke a constitutional crisis when a vital issue is at stake  \u2014   on an insignificant matter. \u201cI hate to see a president waste that kind of authority, which should only be deployed for our most important questions, on this immigration order, which the president could easily withdraw, fix and resubmit,\u201d said Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPresident Trump is pressing the accelerator down to 120 miles per hour on every single issue. He will exhaust himself and exhaust his presidency. \u201d Peter Wallison, a former White House counsel to Ronald Reagan, said the president often wished to weigh in on legal matters concerning personal friends or issues important to his administration, and Mr. Wallison always advised against it, both to protect the tradition of judicial independence and avoid undercutting the courts\u2019 legitimacy. \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal, it\u2019s not a violation of the law to say these things, but it\u2019s bad policy because it raises questions about the independence of the courts, and it raises questions about the judicial system as a whole when the president says this,\u201d Mr. Wallison said. Mr. Reagan did not always take his advice, he added, and in those instances, \u201cI always cringed. \u201d Mr. Trump defended the process that yielded the executive order, saying he had initially wanted to wait a week or even a month before issuing the travel ban. But he said he was told by law enforcement officials that doing so would prompt a flood of people, including some with \u201cvery evil intentions,\u201d to rush into the United States before the restrictions took effect. That account appears to be at odds with the one given by several senior officials, who have said they were not fully briefed on the details of Mr. Trump\u2019s order until the day the president signed it at the Pentagon. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the law enforcement officers that he was acting solely out of a concern about terrorism, a threat he said had deepened since he took office and gained access to information about the risks facing Americans. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to take care of it. We\u2019re going to win. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564395.564291}
