She has now painted herself into the proverbial corner, and any evidence that the FBI produces will be amplified in light of her vigorous denials.   30, 2016 Interestingly, in 2016 at the height of the race for president, Hillary decides to adopt Bill\u2019s bold denial strategy \\nWay back when in 1998 , as the Bill Clinton sex scandal with intern Monica Lewinsky was coming to light, Slick Willy decided on a very risky strategy. Knowing full well that he was 100% guilty as charged, he decided to look right into the unblinking eye of the camera and issue a full-throated denial of any involvement of any kind. Watch and see it for yourself: Bill Clinton denies having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: \\nNow what Bill Clinton did not know was that Monica had saved a semen-stained blue dress with Bill Clinton\u2019s semen on it, which she promptly presented as evidence to prove that she was not lying. By this time she was being trashed by Clinton operatives desperate to save Bill\u2019s presidency, chief of whom was Crooked Hillary who had lots of nasty things to say about her husband\u2019s victims. That led to this moment as seen here: Bill Clinton admits to having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: Interestingly, in 2016 at the height of the race for president, Hillary decides to adopt Bill\u2019s bold denial strategy \\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign hopes, as reported by Bloomberg today , its unusually swift response to revelations about a fresh FBI investigation into messages in connection with a past probe of her private e-mail server will blunt the political damage amid concern about close Senate races as well as the presidential election. \\nWith nine days to go until the election , Clinton and her aides went on the attack, intensifying criticism of James Comey as word emerged that the FBI director defied U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch by informing lawmakers of newly discovered e-mails that may relate to its investigation of the Democratic presidential nominee. Hillary Clinton addresses FBI email investigation: \\nClinton\u2019s aggressive strategy contrasts with her bunker mentality in previous episodes of the controversy over her e-mail practices at the State Department. Her campaign is taking a calculated risk in publicly criticizing Comey and pressing him to quickly release more detail. Should new information contradict past statements or call into question the judgment of Clinton or any of her advisers who migrated from the Obama administration to her campaign, it could be damaging. \\nHer rival Donald Trump told an audience in Phoenix the \u201conly reason\u201d Comey must have felt the need to tell lawmakers of the newly discovered e-mails is that \u201cvery, very serious things must be happening and must have been found. Very, very serious. Very, very serious.\u201d \\nSince Crooked Hillary has no idea what the FBI actually found, her gambit is every bit as bold, and reckless, as was her husband\u2019s decades earlier. She has now painted herself into the proverbial corner, and any evidence that the FBI produces will be amplified in light of her vigorous denials. The WikiLeaks emails showed us that even John Podesta said she \u201clacks judgment\u201d and discernment , and this is certain proof of that. \\nBut such is life when you\u2019re a Clinton. Look right into the camera and commence lying. This is how they roll. \\n \""}, "time": 1742564587.6368558}
