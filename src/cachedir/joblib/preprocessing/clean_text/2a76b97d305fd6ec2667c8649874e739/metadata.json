Just follow me on Twitter,\u201d New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett said when he announced he would not attend the White House celebration with President Trump for the victors of Super Bowl LI on Sunday. [Bennett stated that he\u2019s \u201cnot really worried\u201d about the fact that Tom Brady, Coach Belichick, and Patriots owner Robert Kraft have all expressed their friendship with the nation\u2019s 45th president. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it at all,\u201d he insisted.  One day before the November presidential election, Bennett tweeted \u201cI\u2019m with her,\u201d indicating that he planned on casting his vote for Hillary Clinton. I\u2019m with her.  \u2014   Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 8, 2016,  Bennett also tweeted in January that the \u201cpresident dude\u201d was not inclusive and worried that Trump may ban celebrating the Chinese New Year in America: America was built on inclusiveness not exclusiveness.  \u2014   Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) January 30, 2017,  Surprised the president dude didn\u2019t ban celebrating Chinese New Year in America!!  \u2014   Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) January 29, 2017,  The    second round draft choice by the Dallas Cowboys in 2008 insists that he doesn\u2019t bring his political views to work. \u201cWe all have our beliefs. We accept people for who they are,\u201d asserts Bennett. Apparently, Bennett who connected with Brady for five passes and drew a crucial pass interference call toward the end of overtime doesn\u2019t plan on accepting President Trump \u201cfor who he is,\u201d as Yahoo Sports pointed out.  Bennett is not the first to boycott a Super Bowl gathering with the sitting president. In 2015, after the Pats won Super Bowl 49 by beating the Seahawks, Tom Brady did not make it to the White House gala hosted by former president Barack Obama.'"}, "time": 1742564318.3166564}
