Sara Danius, the Swedish Academy\u2019s permanent secretary, broke the news in a blog post titled \u201cGood News About Dylan\u201d on Wednesday, and a spokeswoman for the Academy confirmed it. A representative for Mr. Dylan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ms. Danius wrote that Mr. Dylan  \u2014   who greeted news of the prize last fall with two weeks of silence and skipped the December ceremony because of \u201c  commitments\u201d  \u2014   would meet with members of the Academy while in town to play two concerts at the Stockholm Waterfront. She said that those behind the prize will \u201cshow up at one of the performances\u201d and \u201chand over\u201d Mr. Dylan\u2019s commemorative diploma and medal in person. \u201cThe setting will be small and intimate, and no media will be present only Bob Dylan and members of the Academy will attend, all according to Dylan\u2019s wishes,\u201d Ms. Danius added. Yet some uncertainty still remains. Nobel laureates, who are awarded 8 million Swedish krona, or about $900, 000, are required to give a lecture on their subject within six months of the prize ceremony, which was held on Dec. 10. Mr. Dylan will not deliver his this weekend. His deadline is in June. Ms. Danius wrote: \u201cThe Academy has reason to believe that a taped version will be sent at a later point. (Taped Nobel lectures are presented now and then, the latest of which was that of Nobel Laureate Alice Munro in 2013.) At this point no further details are known. \u201d For the ceremony in December, Patti Smith performed a version of Mr. Dylan\u2019s \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s   Fall,\u201d while the American ambassador to Sweden, Azita Raji, read a gracious acceptance speech from the singer. \u201cNot once have I ever had the time to ask myself, \u2018Are my songs literature?\u2019 \u201d wrote Mr. Dylan, a controversial pick because his medium is song. \u201cSo, I do thank the Swedish Academy, both for taking the time to consider that very question, and, ultimately, for providing such a wonderful answer. \u201d More recently, the singer, who rarely engages with the public beyond the stage, gave a lengthy interview to the author and music television executive Bill Flanagan. The chat, which was posted to Mr. Dylan\u2019s official website, covered his new   album of standards, \u201cTriplicate,\u201d in detail, as well as scattered memories of the music business, but mentioned the Nobel Prize not once. In what has proved to be a busy season for Dylanologists, there is still more to pore over: The singer\u2019s new historical archive in Tulsa, Okla. announced on Tuesday that it was officially open to researchers. Because of high demand, those Dylan scholars interested in viewing the 6, 000 artifacts from across six decades must apply for access, showing that their projects qualify for an appointment. A list of everything in the archive, which was previewed by The New York Times last year, is available to both eager researchers and curious super fans online. Among the contents: Lyrics, written in notebooks, on hotel stationery and matchbook covers, along with personal letters, recording contracts and even Mr. Dylan\u2019s leather wallet from 1966, containing \u201cJohnny Cash\u2019s contact information and three business cards. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628526.438756}
