Tuesday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Donald Trump, Jr. defended his father\u2019s response to the London terrorist attack over the weekend that has resulted in at least seven people dead.  Trump, Jr. argued it was time to be more proactive in taking on terrorism rather than to \u201ckeep calm and carry on. \u201d \u201cEvery time he puts something out there, he gets criticized by the media, all day every day,\u201d Trump, Jr said. \u201cAnd then guess what? Two weeks later, he\u2019s proven to be right. It happened again, and we keep appeasing it, and we keep saying OK it\u2019s going to be great, we\u2019re going to hold fast, and we\u2019re going to keep calm and carry on. \u201d \u201cMaybe we have to keep calm and actually do something,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to say, because he\u2019s been proven right about it every time. This is a recurring theme and we\u2019re attacked. But maybe, rather than the mayor of London attacking, maybe he should do something about it. Maybe he should do something to fix the problem rather than just sit there and pretend there isn\u2019t one. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742562226.653926}
