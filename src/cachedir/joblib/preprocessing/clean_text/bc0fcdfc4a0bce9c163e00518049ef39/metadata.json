[The New Yorker article, written by Alexandra Schwartz, claims MILO is known for \u201cleading a racist online harassment campaign against the comedian Leslie Jones. \u201d Jones, however, had already been engaging with Twitter trolls for hours before ever interacting with MILO. \u201cIf at first you don\u2019t succeed (because you\u2019re work is terrible) play the victim.
