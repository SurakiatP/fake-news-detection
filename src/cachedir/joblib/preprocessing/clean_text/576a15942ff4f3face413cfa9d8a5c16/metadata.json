The opinion and news site, once a curiosity of the fringe right wing, is now an increasingly powerful voice, and virtual rallying spot, for millions of disaffected conservatives who propelled Donald J. Trump to the Republican nomination for president. Known for gleefully bashing the old Republican establishment, Breitbart now finds itself at the center of the party\u2019s presidential campaign. Its longtime chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, was named campaign chief by Mr. Trump, whose nationalist,   message routinely mirrors the Breitbart worldview. On Facebook, it rivals news organizations like The Washington Post and Yahoo, and it has challenged conservative favorites like Fox News in its influence on the campaign, if not in size of audience. On Thursday, the site received its biggest billing yet  \u2014   in the form of a scathing condemnation. In a nationally televised speech, Hillary Clinton identified Breitbart as the Democratic Party\u2019s media enemy No. 1, warning about a \u201cde facto merger\u201d between the Trump campaign and a news outlet that she described as racist, radical and offensive. For Mrs. Clinton, it was a strategic attack that linked Mr. Trump to leading avatars of the   right. But among Breitbart\u2019s ideologically driven journalists, her remarks were taken as validation. \u201cI\u2019ll play it cool, but not that cool: It was a big moment,\u201d the site\u2019s editor in chief, Alexander Marlow, 30, said in an interview on Friday. \u201cA major presidential candidate engaging us like that, and calling us out directly, was quite thrilling. \u201d The rise of Breitbart News, founded a decade ago by the provocateur Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012, is an unlikely outcome for a small, decentralized news outlet with a penchant for infighting. But it remains an outsize source of controversy  \u2014   for liberals and even many traditional conservatives  \u2014   over material that has been called misogynist, xenophobic and racist. The site refers to \u201cmigrant rape gangs\u201d in Europe, and was among the first news outlets to disseminate unsubstantiated rumors that Mrs. Clinton was in ill health. Its writers often vilify the Black Lives Matter movement, emphasizing what they call a scourge of \u201c   crime,\u201d and described \u201cyoung Muslims in the West\u201d as the world\u2019s \u201cticking time bomb. \u201d Before Mr. Breitbart died, the site had gained notoriety by championing the Tea Party movement and publicizing an undercover video that led to the closing of Acorn, the community organizing group. It also posted misleading footage of Shirley Sherrod, a black Department of Agriculture official, who was fired for seeming to express resentment toward a white farmer the White House later apologized. Last month, Milo Yiannopoulos, the site\u2019s tech editor, was banned from Twitter after inspiring a sustained online harassment campaign against the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actor Leslie Jones. Reports surfaced this week about domestic violence charges filed against Mr. Bannon stemming from a divorce in 1996. Supporters say it is the site\u2019s willingness to embrace viewpoints considered far outside the bounds of respectable political discourse that is the very source of its success  \u2014   in the same way that Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme proposals, like banning Muslims from entering the country, galvanized the Republican primary electorate. And like Mr. Trump, Breitbart excels on social media. Last month, it ranked as the 11th most popular site on Facebook, according to statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip. A year ago, its Facebook page had fewer than a million followers now, it has more than 2. 3 million. The Breitbart home page drew 18 million visitors last month, roughly the same as Politico, according to data from comScore. It beat conservative competitors like The Daily Caller, though mainstream sites like CNN draw tens of millions more visitors each month. Breitbart, which is privately owned, has declined to release revenue figures. The site appears to be backed by Mr. Breitbart\u2019s estate its chief executive, Larry Solov and the family of Robert Mercer, a wealthy conservative donor and Trump supporter, according to corporate documents and two people briefed on the company\u2019s finances. For Mr. Marlow, the editor in chief, the site\u2019s success comes from attracting an underserved segment of conservatives  \u2014   opponents of immigration and free trade who did not see their views reflected in other outlets. In online conservative news media, Mr. Marlow said, \u201cThe focus has not been on the traditional    dichotomy. It\u2019s become populism and nationalism versus globalism. \u201d He said that Fox News, long a favored venue for the Republican establishment, had lost its feel for the   right, saying the network harps on older controversies, like the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, and that its owner, Rupert Murdoch, is unwilling to criticize open immigration. \u201cFox is critical of Trump and a lot of the values that his voters stand for,\u201d Mr. Marlow said. \u201cA lot of conservatives feel betrayed. \u201d (Fox News has drawn its   ratings amid this year\u2019s campaign, and Mr. Trump routinely appears on the network. \u201cWe will let our   year speak for itself,\u201d the network said in a statement on Friday.) For those who track hate groups, Breitbart\u2019s success is particularly alarming. \u201cBreitbart in the last year or so has consistently picked up themes coming from the \u201d said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, using a nickname for a loosely affiliated online movement that includes   nationalists and many supporters of Mr. Trump. Ms. Beirich said that Breitbart came to her attention because she found that white supremacist websites, like The Daily Stormer, were increasingly linking to its coverage. \u201cTo people in the   who have basically been maligned and haven\u2019t been part of the political system at all, this is a big, big deal,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cTheir views are finally in the mainstream. \u201d It was this development that prompted aides to Mrs. Clinton to consider whether she should explicitly call out Breitbart to voters. \u201cWe think it\u2019s important that people understand what Trump stands for, and what these groups stand for, and what it means that he echoes them,\u201d said Glen Caplin, a Clinton campaign spokesman. Breitbart issued a statement on Thursday dismissing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s address as \u201cone of the most bizarre, paranoid, conspiratorial presidential campaign speeches in recent memory. \u201d On Friday it posted a list of what it called the \u201cTop 20 lies in Hillary\u2019s \u2018 \u2019 speech. \u201d Not everyone affiliated with Breitbart is pleased with the site\u2019s recent turn. Several longtime staff members quit earlier this year, saying that Mr. Bannon had turned a website founded on   grounds into a de facto propaganda outlet for Mr. Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be Andrew Breitbart\u2019s proudest moment to be called the foundation for white supremacy on the internet,\u201d Ben Shapiro, one of the editors who resigned, said on Friday. Did Mr. Shapiro ever expect to see Breitbart, which began as a   aggregator of wire stories, prominently featured in a speech by a   presidential candidate? \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have surprised me if a Democratic presidential candidate did that,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised that she\u2019s not wrong. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564261.5819938}
