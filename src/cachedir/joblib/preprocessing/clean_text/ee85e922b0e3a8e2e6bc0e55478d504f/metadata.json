[\u201cI was criticizing people this morning for attacking Melania and saying horrible things,\u201d Boy George told the Hollywood Reporter at the Dior Homme show on Saturday.  \u201cYou know what? As somebody who has a past, I think it\u2019s really wrong and   of women to be so abusive,\u201d he added, further noting that the First Lady\u2019s Herve   inauguration gown \u201clooked amazing. \u201d But the   artist also sounded a note of apprehension about Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cA leader is supposed to be compassionate and inclusive that\u2019s a real leader,\u201d George told THR. \u201cBeing strong isn\u2019t necessarily the answer. It takes strength to be compassionate and to think about people you maybe don\u2019t understand. \u201d George\u2019s defense of Melania Trump comes on the heels of reports that several renowned fashion designers are lining up to dress the First Lady, after other designers had said they would not. Designer Stefano Gabbana,   of fashion house Dolce  Gabbana, has spent months posting photos on his Instagram of Mrs. Trump wearing clothes he designed. The photos caused controversy on social media, and Gabbana fired back at his critics who were threatening to boycott his designs. \u201cHow many stupid and ignorant people r on Instagram! !!\u201d Gabbana wrote back in one of several comments taking aim at the negative posters. \u201cPlease if you don\u2019t like my post unfollow me  \u2026     thank you. \u201d In October, designer Calvin Klein said \u201cof course\u201d he would dress Melania Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Klein told TMZ.
