There are. I\u2019d be happy to slaughter them. \u201d Killing that number of drug users would \u201cfinish the problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition,\u201d he said. Since Mr. Duterte took office in June promising a grisly campaign against crime and drugs, the Philippines has seen a surge in killings of drug suspects. Philippine officials have counted about 3, 000 deaths during the crackdown, about a third at the hands of the police. The police spokesman Dionardo Carlos said on Friday that the police had been overstating the number killed by the police. He said that the correct number was 1, 120, not about 1, 500, which the police had given earlier. He did not explain why the number had been revised. The police have also said that 1, 500 nonpolice killings are under investigation and that hundreds of these also are believed to be  . Responding to expressions of alarm about the killings from the European Union and other international bodies, Mr. Duterte said Friday that the European Union\u2019s advisers on the issue were \u201c . \u201d He criticized European officials for finding fault with his government while not doing enough to help migrants fleeing   Middle Eastern countries. \u201cYou allow them to rot, and then you\u2019re worried about the death of about 1, 000, 2, 000, 3, 000?\u201d he said. Mr. Duterte complained that his foreign critics had depicted him as \u201ca cousin of Hitler\u201d and said that they were wrong to criticize him now that he was the country\u2019s president. Doing so put all Filipinos \u201cto shame,\u201d he said. The president\u2019s latest provocative remarks came days after he cast doubt on the Philippines\u2019 longstanding military ties with the United States, announcing in Vietnam that the countries\u2019 coming joint military exercises would be their last. Officials in his government later said that all military agreements with the United States were still in effect and that they were awaiting \u201cclarification and guidance\u201d from Mr. Duterte. While in Vietnam, Mr. Duterte also said he had received information that \u201cthe C. I. A. is planning to kill me. \u201d Officials in his government and at the United States Embassy in Manila declined to comment on that statement. A spokeswoman for the embassy, Molly Koscina, said Friday that the United States would continue to work with the Philippines to \u201cuphold our shared democratic values. \u201d She said the relationship was built on \u201cshared sacrifices for democracy and human rights, and strong    and societal ties, and obviously we\u2019d like to see that continue. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562458.8216178}
