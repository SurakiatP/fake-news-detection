That\u2019s partially why \u201cUnReal,\u201d set within a reality show, and \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d set among hacker activists, excite me so much, or shows like \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d and \u201cParty Down\u201d stay with me  \u2014   they created and define my image of a funeral home and of a catering company. (Er   \u2026     respectively.) This week, I\u2019m spotlighting three shows that are, in significant ways, not like every other show. \u201cGreenleaf\u201d does something we relatively rarely on TV: It depicts religiosity. (The show\u2019s creator Craig Wright has a background in theology.) The stars and creators of \u201cBlackstone\u201d are indigenous people  \u2014   rarer still. And the chilly drama \u201cThirteen\u201d is oriented around grief rather than horror. Hooray for anyone forging new paths. That\u2019s also why I find myself wishing for stranger shows, and imaging oddball settings. I want a   soap set in the world of figure skating! Or an anthology like \u201cIn Treatment,\u201d but where everyone has the same piano teacher, instead of the same therapist. Or a \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d but serious. A girl can dream. Lots to watch this week, and I hope you\u2019ll share your secret dream setting for a TV show with me and Team Watching: watching@nytimes. com. \u201cGreenleaf,\u201d Tuesday, 10 p. m. with two more episodes Wednesday from 9 p. m. to 11 p. m. OWN Watch if you like \u201ceverybody has a secret\u201d ensemble shows, stories about modern American Christianity and unusual workplace settings. \u201cGreenleaf\u201d is set within a black megachurch in Memphis and focuses on the Greenleaf family who runs the church and the prodigal daughter who has just returned to the fold after the mysterious death of her sister. There\u2019s some contrived dialogue, and not all of the performances are at the same level. But the show is worth sticking with, particularly if you like twisty family stories that involve decades of resentment. The standout of the series is Keith David, who plays the family patriarch and bishop of the church. The scenes in which he preaches work better than most actual religious services I have attended. The members of his family and congregation say goodbye to one another by saying \u201cGod is good\u201d and responding \u201call the time. \u201d I wish \u201cGreenleaf\u201d was good all the time, and it\u2019s not quite, but it\u2019s good some of the time, and features neither cops nor vampires, so I\u2019m in for now. \u201cThirteen,\u201d Thursday, 10 p. m. BBC America Watch if you like spooky foreign   and care more about the journey than the destination. Ivy Moxam (Jodie Comer of \u201cMy Mad Fat Diary\u201d) was kidnapped as a teenager 13 years ago. Now she\u2019s back. But what happened to her while she was gone? This     is less focused on being a whodunit and more concerned with Ivy\u2019s emotional state and the unbearable weight her loved ones have carried around. It\u2019s reminiscent of the French series \u201cLes Revenants\u201d (which has a supernatural element, unlike \u201cThirteen\u201d) and is much more on the uncanny side of scary than the horror side. \u201cBlackstone,\u201d Hulu  Watch if you like bleak, unglamorous and distinctive ensemble shows.  \u201cBlackstone\u201d is one of the flagship shows of Canada\u2019s Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, where it made its debut in 2011. It\u2019s set on a (fictional) Blackstone First Nation reserve, within an indigenous community challenged by corruption and desperation. The depths of that corruption start coming to light when Leona (Carmen Moore) wins the election to become the new chief, though her victory celebration is overshadowed by a teenager\u2019s rape and suicide. In its earliest episodes, the series\u2019 dialogue is   and the camera distractingly jumpy. But stick with it: The story is powerful enough to outweigh early shortcomings, and around Episode 5, the show blossoms into itself, and it\u2019s well worth the wait. The first three seasons, with 23 total episodes, are currently on Hulu. (Seasons 4 and 5 have already aired in Canada.) \u2022 Monday: \u201cThe Fosters,\u201d Season 4 premiere, 8 p. m. Freeform. Last season was not my favorite, but this show is so good that even its crummy episodes are better than other show\u2019s good ones. \u2022 Tuesday: \u201cThe Greeks,\u201d series premiere, 9 p. m. PBS. This is a   documentary series about ancient Greece, beginning with how cave people eventually formed societies. Thorough! \u2022 Wednesday: \u201cBig Brother,\u201d Season 18 premiere, 8 p. m. CBS. I hate \u201cBig Brother,\u201d but in my experience many otherwise   people secretly love it. I know you\u2019re out there, Watchers. No judgment. \u2022 Thursday: \u201cQueen of the South,\u201d series premiere, 10 p. m. USA. Based on Arturo  \u2019s book \u201cLa Reina Del Sur\u201d (already adapted as a popular Mexican show) \u201cQueen\u201d follows a Mexican drug queenpin who winds up fleeing to the United States. Some of it feels like other, tenser dramas, but the pilot has promise. \u2022 Friday: \u201cComedy Bang! Bang! ,\u201d 11:30 p. m. IFC. Nathan Fielder, of \u201cNathan For You,\u201d is the guest, so it\u2019ll be a real bonanza of comedy oddness. Game of Thrones: This season\u2019s penultimate episode  \u2014   like those of many previous seasons  \u2014   was  . The \u201cBattle of the Bastards,\u201d between the forces of Jon Snow and Ramsay Bolton, was a spectacle. As Jeremy Egner writes, \u201cWhether you actually slept well Sunday night probably depends on your tolerance for blood, guts, dead giants and other hallmarks of grim medieval battle, as presented in the tense, grimy and at times oddly beautiful clash. \u201d More Game of Thrones: At Hitfix, Alan Sepinwall wonders why he was \u201cso unmoved\u201d by it all. \u201cNo show in TV history has ever done spectacle on this level, as consistently well as \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 has,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut the show at its best finds a way for the characterization to be as powerful as the visuals, and \u2018Battle of the Bastards\u2019 ultimately didn\u2019t manage to surround all those stunning battle images with enough emotional meat to make it all worth it. \u201d Or try this Joanna Robinson piece at Vanity Fair about Sansa\u2019s decisions in the episode. Outlander: \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d wasn\u2019t the only show to allow its characters a measure of vengeance. \u201cMary and Claire get revenge,\u201d Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n writes of Saturday\u2019s episode of \u201cOutlander,\u201d \u201cbut the show doesn\u2019t fully wrestle with what this means for either of them going forward. \u201d Veep: Eight episodes of Catherine standing in the corner with a video camera finally pays off. As Noel Murray writes, \u201cKissing Your Sister\u201d is \u201can offbeat episode that both summarizes and comments on everything that\u2019s happened so far in Season 5. It\u2019s a conceptual tour de force  \u2014   and, more important, it\u2019s very, very funny. \u201d Silicon Valley: \u201cThis seems like an odd question to ponder nearly three full seasons into \u2018Silicon Valley,\u2019\u201d Scott Tobias writes. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth asking: What exactly is Pied Piper anyway?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563362.7510486}
