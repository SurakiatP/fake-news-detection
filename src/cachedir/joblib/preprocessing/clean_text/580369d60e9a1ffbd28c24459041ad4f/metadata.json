Senator Ted Cruz expressed gratitude for the \u201c  good judgment\u201d of Midwesterners. His stump speech had scarcely changed, from a favorite anecdote about a drawling West Texas farmer to a running countdown of the time remaining before the primary. (\u201c  hours,\u201d he said sternly.) He drew a crowd of several hundred at a   community center here, whose cheers at times coaxed the Texas senator to guttural shouts. One woman held a sign: \u201cPray\u2019n For Ted. \u201d \u201cThe eyes of the entire country,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, \u201cnow rest on Indiana. \u201d Yet two days before what is widely viewed as a   primary, Mr. Cruz strained to conceal a grim reality: He is in serious trouble. An NBC   Street   poll released on Sunday showed Donald J. Trump with a lead of 15 points among likely Republican primary voters, 49 percent to 34 percent.   percent of voters said they disapproved of the agreement struck by Mr. Cruz and Gov. John Kasich, which called for Mr. Kasich to abandon campaigning in Indiana in exchange for Mr. Cruz\u2019s withdrawal from Oregon and New Mexico.   percent approved. \u201cThe mainstream media wants this race to be over,\u201d Mr. Cruz told voters, in one of his feistiest stump speeches in memory, lumping in \u201cNew York power brokers\u201d and John Boehner, the former House speaker and frequent Cruz foil, with his usual list of opponents. \u201cThey\u2019ve all made their decision, and they now expect the people of Indiana to fall in line. \u201d Mr. Cruz, typically one of the most accessible candidates in the field, did not take questions from reporters at his rally here. About a   drive away, inside a packed theater in Terre Haute, Mr. Trump reveled in his electoral edge. \u201cIf we win Indiana, it\u2019s over, O. K.?\u201d he said. \u201c Then we can focus on crooked Hillary. Please! Let\u2019s focus on Hillary. \u201d In another flourish, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich \u201ctwo guys that are hanging by their fingernails. \u201d \u201cDon\u2019t let me fall!\u201d Mr. Trump said, mimicking a climber on the edge of a cliff. \u201cDon\u2019t let me fall!\u201d Seeking to break through, Mr. Cruz has in recent days pursued several strategies, tying Mr. Trump to Mrs. Clinton, naming Carly Fiorina as a   running mate and drawing attention to some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more controversial supporters. The senator noted that he and Mr. Trump had each received the endorsement of a   \u201cMike. \u201d In Mr. Cruz\u2019s case, it was Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, who came aboard on Friday. \u201cOr do we stand instead with the convicted rapist Mike Tyson?\u201d Mr. Cruz asked supporters here. \u201cThat\u2019s a choice. It\u2019s a choice we can make. \u201d But Mr. Pence, who praised Mr. Trump effusively before endorsing Mr. Cruz, has not embraced Mr. Cruz\u2019s central message in the state: that Mr. Trump is essentially identical to Mrs. Clinton on policy. The tap dance speaks to the dilemma facing many Republicans who view Mr. Trump as anathema to conservatism but fear alienating his voters. Even Mr. Cruz has been reluctant to make his rejection of Mr. Trump complete. In an interview on Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mr. Cruz grew defensive when pressed on whether he would support Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to lobby for support for Trump as much as possible,\u201d Mr. Cruz told the host, Chuck Todd, who tried more than a   times to extract an answer, in vain. Mr. Trump has himself played down the significance of unifying the party at times, suggesting he could win regardless. On Sunday, he urged Indianans to turn out in two days to supply \u201ca really important mandate. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a mandate for change  \u2014   but not Obama change, real change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mandate for genius. \u201d Though Mr. Cruz has effectively staked his candidacy on Indiana, he has left himself wiggle room. On Thursday, Mr. Cruz called Indiana \u201cthe one thing that stands between us and plunging over the cliff. \u201d On Sunday, there was no such pronouncement. Mr. Cruz\u2019s own polling has likewise shown him trailing Mr. Trump, compelling the campaign to look beyond the state, if at least for a moment. Top surrogates have described the extended primary season as a product of divine will, arguing the entire country deserves a chance to speak. \u201cGod wants every state to be on record,\u201d Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas told voters here. And on Saturday, Mr. Cruz surrendered a full day of Indiana politicking to speak at California\u2019s Republican convention, with an eye on the state\u2019s June 7 election. \u201cCalifornia,\u201d he said there, a bit hopefully, \u201cis going to decide this Republican primary. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628459.5391}
