Trump\u2019s transition efforts while Democrats struggled to unify behind their leadership after a brutal election defeat. \u201cWelcome to the dawn of a new unified Republican government,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said at a news conference Tuesday after a meeting with House Republicans. \u201cThis will be a government focused on turning   Trump\u2019s victory into real progress for the American people. \u201d Mr. Ryan, whose renomination was unanimous, deflected questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of Stephen K. Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News with ties to   nationalists, as his chief strategist, and questions about the role of Mr. Trump\u2019s children in the new administration. Mr. Trump \u201cis so successful because he\u2019s surrounded himself with good people,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. As for Mr. Bannon, who has relentlessly attacked Mr. Ryan, he said, smiling stiffly, \u201cI\u2019m not looking backward. \u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who has led House Democrats since 2003, found herself facing unexpected pushback in her own   efforts. She postponed a vote that had been scheduled for Thursday until Nov. 30, yielding to the demands of members who asked for more time to reassess. The delay is likely to favor Ms. Pelosi, who will have time to remind members of the money she has raised for them over the years and consolidate her support, which runs deep, especially among the women in her caucus. But the building unease with the status quo in their ranks was clear on Tuesday, members said. Before a tense meeting with members, some had urged Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, 43, to challenge Ms. Pelosi, 76. He has not yet decided whether to run against her. Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat who once challenged Ms. Pelosi, said she had previously signed a letter expressing support for her but noted that she would be willing to take a second look at someone from the Rust Belt, where Hillary Clinton lost in what had been Democratic strongholds in presidential elections. \u201cI ran against her for this very reason, that our region needed more voice,\u201d Ms. Kaptur said. Ms. Pelosi called a meeting with other party leaders Tuesday afternoon, and several senior Democrats said there was a jittery feeling in her camp. \u201cWe just got a shellacking last Tuesday,\u201d said Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201cWe got an unexpected defeat, and we\u2019ve got to recalibrate and decide how we go forward. \u201d Democrats were especially stung by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss among   voters. \u201cWe\u2019re the party of Franklin Roosevelt,\u201d said Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe should not be struggling as a party the way we are with   voters. And the fact that we are signals that we need to talk. \u201d The battle reflects a larger debate within the Democratic Party  \u2014   being played out in its choice for the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee  \u2014   pitting those who want to rebuild the base of President Obama\u2019s support among newer and more diverse voters and those who want to court anew the party\u2019s white   voters, especially in the Midwest. Among Republicans, there was ambiguity of a different sort as they struggled to determine who was in charge of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy agenda. For now, it appears that Vice   Mike Pence is making the calls to Capitol Hill. \u201cNobody really knows,\u201d former Speaker John Boehner said of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda in an interview with CNBC. He added, \u201cHe is barely a Republican. He could barely be a Democrat as well. Nobody really knows where he is going. \u201d Other Republicans were generally positive about the prospects of a government in their full control, in spite of the early signs of a bumpy transition. Most Republicans said they knew nothing about Mr. Bannon and had little knowledge of his background. \u201cI really have only met him once,\u201d said Representative Peter King, Republican of New York. \u201cPeople I\u2019ve spoken to in the campaign have a high regard for him. That\u2019s really all I know. \u201d There were also clear signs that not all of Mr. Trump\u2019s appointments and legislative notions would get unanimous support from his party. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, spoke out against the possibilities of either Rudolph W. Giuliani or John Bolton as nominees for secretary of state. \u201cBolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hellbent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U. S. has made in the last 15 years,\u201d Mr. Paul wrote in an editorial. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he supported much of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, but was also critical of his views on Russia and many of his previous policy proposals on immigration. \u201cI will not vote for a bill that treats a grandmother and a drug dealer the same,\u201d Mr. Graham said.'"}, "time": 1742628533.114517}
