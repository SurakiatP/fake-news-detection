And it looks like the establishment media are just getting started. [After the Washington Post named Kushner as the \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, Kushner, in just a matter of days, as Fox News\u2019s Howard Kurtz wrote, \u201chas become the media\u2019s biggest target \u2014  that is, right after his   . \u201d  Kushner may have thought firing Comey would be a \u201cwin\u201d for Trump because Democrats blamed Comey for costing Hillary Clinton the election. But the media never granted Trump a honeymoon period and will not give him automatic \u201cwins\u201d because they consider him an illegitimate outsider. And, as Kushner is finding out, because he is regarded as Trump\u2019s top adviser, Kushner will always be in the media\u2019s crosshairs no matter how much he tries to \u201cmoderate\u201d Trump or court and charm the media. After media outlets initially reported that a White House official in Trump\u2019s inner circle was a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, the Washington Post last Friday dropped a supposed \u201cbombshell\u201d report naming Kushner as the \u201cperson of interest\u201d who allegedly wanted a \u201cback channel\u201d to communicate with Russian officials. But as Breitbart    Joel Pollak noted, nothing in the Post\u2019s article was new: \u201cThe meeting with Kislyak was reported nearly three months ago. The meeting with the banker was reported two months ago. And stories about a potential \u2018back channel\u2019 were reported almost two months ago. \u201d In fact, Kushner is reportedly not even a \u201ctarget\u201d of the investigation. There is also no smoking gun proving Kushner colluded with Russia or did anything illegal, for that matter, as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper emphasized on Sunday. But the media have treated Kushner, like they do with nearly every Republican who does not have favored status with them, as if he is guilty until proven innocent. The establishment press have largely brushed aside the notion that Kushner may have wanted to set up the \u201cback channel\u201d to discuss Syria policy, especially if he feared that the Obama administration may have been spying on Trump\u2019s campaign team. Fox News reported that the idea for a \u201cback channel\u201d was not even Kushner\u2019s idea in the first place. The media have also downplayed the fact that Russians often embellish things to engage in disinformation campaigns. Take CNN\u2019s report, based on leaks from two anonymous former intelligence officials and even a congressional source, about the Russians having potentially \u201cderogatory\u201d information on Trump and his top aides. CNN reported that the Russians believed they had \u201cleverage\u201d on Trump\u2019s inner circle, especially regarding financial issues. It is only until after the sensational claims are made that the outlet points out that this information \u201ccould have been exaggerated or even made up\u201d because \u201cthe Russians could be overstating\u201d things. There are certainly more questions that need to be answered \u2014  like whether Kushner met with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov as a representative of his private company or as a representative of Trump\u2019s transition team. But the controversy surrounding Kushner, which the media have ginned up with their anonymous leakers from the Deep State intent on undermining Trump, has given the media an excuse to damage Kushner politically. As if the media had many of these stories in their back pockets for the perfect time, the media immediately blitzed Kushner with an onslaught negative pieces. Here are ten ways the antagonistic press, with help from Deep State officials, have recently ganged up on Kushner. 1. Romney Redux: Kushner Depicted as Soulless Slumlord, The establishment media never investigated Obama\u2019s top confidante and adviser Valerie Jarrett\u2019s real estate holdings to depict her as a slumlord despite a body of evidence that was right in front of them. But nearly four months into Trump\u2019s presidency, the media suddenly had the resources and the wherewithal to find former tenants who lived in Kushner\u2019s properties to depict Trump\u2019s    as a seedy slumlord. ProPublica and the New York Times collaborated on an extensive story about Kushner\u2019s real estate holdings and depicted Kushner as a seedy and greedy slumlord. The piece was titled, \u201cThe Beleaguered Tenants of \u2018Kushnerville. \u201d They found former tenant Kamiia Warren, who reportedly moved out of her East Baltimore townhouse when a neighbor started acting strangely \u2014  like shouting through and banging on the walls at night, which often woke up her child. According to the report, \u201cWarren sent a letter reporting the problem to the complex\u2019s property manager\u201d and \u201csubmitted the requisite form giving two months\u2019 notice that she was transferring her Section 8 voucher  \u2014   the federal   subsidy that helped her pay the rent  \u2014   elsewhere. The complex\u2019s   manager signed the form a week later, checking the line that read \u2018The tenant gave notice in accordance with the lease. \u2019\u201d Three years later, according to the report, she was sued for $3, 014. 08 by JK2 Westminster LLC, Kushner\u2019s real estate company, and the lawsuit \u201cclaimed she owed the money for having left in advance of her lease\u2019s expiration, though she had received written permission to leave. \u201d The establishment media are at their best when depicting Republicans (or even Democrats like Kushner who are now associated with Republicans) as heartless (see: Mitt Romney). The report points out that \u201cWarren was raising three children alone while taking classes for a bachelor\u2019s degree in health care administration\u201d and paints Kushner and his associates as villains who preyed on an innocent single mother. According to the report, Warren lost her first appeal because \u201cshe did not have a copy of the form the manager had signed. The judge ruled against Warren, awarding JK2 Westminster the full sum it was seeking, plus court costs, attorney\u2019s fees and interest that brought the judgment to nearly $5, 000. \u201d Kushner\u2019s company has reportedly pursued such actions against \u201chundreds\u201d of past tenants over the last five years. When Warren could not afford to pay the judgment, Kushner\u2019s company \u201cfiled a request to garnish her wages from her   elder care job. Five days earlier, Warren had gone to court to fill out a handwritten motion saying she had proof that she was given permission to leave Cove Village in 2010  \u2014   she had finally managed to get a copy from the housing department. \u201d But since she did not know that she had to attach a copy of her form to the motion, it was denied. Warren\u2019s bank account was ultimately \u201czeroed out\u201d and when she returned to court with all of the proper paperwork, her case was reportedly dismissed again without explanation. One of Kushner\u2019s lawyers reportedly told her, \u201cThis is not going to go away. You will pay us. \u201d Soon after, according to the report, \u201cthe court sent notice of a $4, 615 lien against Warren. \u201d 2. Kushner Threw Trump Under Bus, Claimed    Thinks GOP Base Is \u2018Stupid\u2019 When a former Kushner employee (  York Observer editor) claimed that Kushner once told her that Trump was promoting \u201cbirtherism\u201d even though \u201che really doesn\u2019t believe it\u201d because \u201che knows Republicans are stupid and they\u2019ll buy it,\u201d the press jumped on the comments as proof that Trump is a \u201cman with no real morals, no real beliefs, but who is willing to peddle any sort of hatred or monstrous thought if he thinks that it will help him toward the nebulous goal of \u2018winning. \u2019\u201d 3. Media Report Trump \u2018Angry\u2019 at Kushner, Relationship Showing \u2018Unmistakable Signs of Strain\u2019 Though Trump went on the record to publicly support Kushner, the media did their best to undercut Trump\u2019s comments with stories about how Trump was losing confidence in Kushner\u2019s judgment and political acumen. Trump explicitly told the New York Times that \u201cJared is doing a great job for the country\u201d and \u201cI have total confidence in him. He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person. \u201d Yet, media outlets pointed out that Trump was not that close to Kushner before Kushner joined his campaign and quoted anonymous sources who said that Trump has yelled at Kushner in recent meetings. The Times reported that Trump has even made snide and disparaging comments about Kushner\u2019s family after Kushner\u2019s sister reportedly tried to peddle her brother\u2019s access in the White House and \u201cdangled the availability of   visas to the United States as an enticement for Chinese financiers willing to spend $500, 000 or more\u201d to invest in Kushner\u2019s real estate holdings. 4. Huffington Post: Marrying Ivanka on Calculating Kushner\u2019s \u2018Checklist\u2019 to \u2018Rehabilitate\u2019 Family Name, According to the   Huffington Post, \u201cwhen Charles Kushner was heading to federal prison in 2005 for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering, his son Jared got some advice from Howard Rubenstein \u2015 the dean of New York damage control \u2015 on how to rehabilitate the Kushner name, Charles would later tell a family friend\u201d: Step one: Buy a New York newspaper. Don\u2019t be too particular, Rubenstein told Jared, according to the family friend\u2019s recounting of their conversation with Charles. Any newspaper will do. Step two: Buy a big Manhattan building. Any building will do. Step three: Marry the daughter of a rich New York family. Anyone will do. The Huffington Post notes that Jared Kushner \u201cwent on to do just that. He bought the New York Observer in 2006, made a   $1. 8 billion purchase of 666 Fifth Ave. in 2007 and married Ivanka Trump in 2009. \u201d \u201cWhether or not Kushner was indeed working through a checklist, his actions during those years have served him well,\u201d the \u201cstory\u201d points out. \u201cThey also laid the groundwork for the meticulous public relations strategy that has made possible Kushner\u2019s current paradoxical role in the press, as a blameless yet uniquely powerful member of the Trump administration. \u201d Kushner\u2019s spokesman reportedly denied the account and Rubenstein told the outlet that the account was \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cI never said that or anything like that. \u201d But when it comes to making Trump\u2019s    look bad, such a story is too good for outlets like the Huffington Post not to print. 5. Former Kushner Employees Smear Jared: \u2018Vindictive Sh*thead\u2019 Media outlets who were uncurious for eight years about former employees of top Obama administration officials suddenly started interviewing former employees and editors of Kushner\u2019s newspaper \u2014  the New York Observer. Of course, the media found those who were all too eager to smear Kushner. An \u201canonymous\u201d editor described to the Washington Post that Kushner was insistent on getting a \u201chit job\u201d on a banker who would not help Kushner refinance one of his buildings. Kushner was reportedly still upset when the paper\u2019s editors \u2014  even after assigning three different reporters to find dirt on the banker \u2014  decided that \u201cthere\u2019s no story there. \u201d Politico spoke to another former Kushner employee \u2014  Harleen Kahlon \u2014  who claimed that Kushner asked her to \u201ctake one for the team\u201d and forego her performance bonus based on meeting \u201cagreed upon metrics on page views and audience growth. \u201d: Kahlon abruptly quit. Ever since, whenever she sees him on TV or on the streets of New York, she points him out to people as: \u201cthe guy that stole my money. Just before the election, Kahlon described her former boss on Facebook thusly: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a guy who isn\u2019t particularly bright or   doesn\u2019t actually know anything, has bought his way into everything ever (with money he got from his criminal father) who is deeply insecure and obsessed with fame (you don\u2019t buy the NYO, marry Ivanka Trump, or constantly talk about the phone calls you get from celebrities if it\u2019s in your nature to \u2018shun the spotlight\u2019) and who is basically a shithead. \u201d 6.   Officials Claim Kushner Guilty of Espionage, May Even Be Russian Agent, Though Obama\u2019s former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that his \u201cdashboard warning light was clearly on\u201d when he found out about Kushner\u2019s dealing with Russian agents, he emphasized that there is \u201cno evidence of collusion. \u201d But the media rushed to get former Deep State officials who were all too eager to slam Kushner. Former intelligence agent Malcolm Nance suggested Kushner may be guilty of espionage and called for Kushner\u2019s security clearance to be revoked immediately. Former double agent Naveed Jamali went as far to say he thought Kushner was actually a Russian agent, a comment which even shocked an MSNBC host. 7. Media Suggest Kushner Family Want to Profit off Trump Presidency, Media outlets hinted that Kushner and his family may be more interested in using Trump\u2019s presidency to pad their bottom lines and enhancing their images. They pointed to the fact that a day before Kushner\u2019s sister sought funding from Chinese investors through the   investor visa program, Trump extended the program when he signed the most recent spending bill, \u201craising many eyebrows. \u201d Even the suggestion that Kushner and his family may be trying to profit off Trump\u2019s name has made Trump livid, according go the Times. The Times pointed out Kushner\u2019s sister\u2019s   pitch to Chinese nationals \u201cviolated two major rules: Politically, it undercut his immigration crackdown, and in a personal sense, it smacked of profiteering off Mr. Trump  \u2014   one of the sins that warrants expulsion from his orbit. \u201d 8. Kushner Is \u2018Naive,\u2019 \u2018Unqualified\u2019 and Dumb  \u2026     Establishment media outlets used comments from former intelligence officials to push the narrative that Kushner was \u201cin over his head\u201d and naive to handle foreign affairs. When asked about Kushner\u2019s alleged action, Michael Hayden, the former CIA and NSA Director, told CNN, \u201cright now, I\u2019m going with na\u00efvet\u00e9, and that\u2019s not particularly comforting for me. \u201d \u201cWhat manner of ignorance, chaos, hubris, suspicion, contempt would you have to have to think that doing this with the Russian ambassador was a good or an appropriate idea? ,\u201d he asked. Former KGB spy Jack Barsky told CNN that Kushner was \u201cnaive\u201d and \u201ccompletely unqualified\u201d to deal with the Russians because of the \u201cinexperience he has in international affairs. \u201d He called Kushner\u2019s alleged actions \u201c . \u201d 9.   \u2026     Or Maybe \u2018Desperate\u2019? The Atlantic\u2019s David Frum suggested that perhaps Kushner was not naive but rather desperate to get financing for his family\u2019s Manhattan tower. \u201cMaybe Kushner was desperate, not dumb   \u2026     His family faced a huge hike in its debt servicing costs in December 2016. \u201d Frum wrote. He cited a Bloomberg News report that claimed a Manhattan tower that Kushner\u2019s family   \u201chas been losing money for three years and faces increasing loan fees in 2017, which may explain why the family has been negotiating with Chinese insurance behemoth Anbang on new financing\u201d: The fees, at 666 Fifth Avenue, kicked in last month and escalate with each payment until the loan is repaid, a 2011 refinancing agreement shows. December brings another hurdle: Interest paid on the bulk of about $1. 1 billion of loans jumps to 6. 35 percent, more than double what it was after the debt was refinanced in 2011. And as the city\u2019s biggest office construction boom in a quarter century creates a glut of supply, the property\u2019s occupancy rates are falling. Seventy percent of the building was filled as of September, filings by LNR Partners, the loan managers, show. This is well below 91 percent for the New York metro area reported at year\u2019s end by Reis, the   firm, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jeffrey Langbaum. 10. Media: \u2018Miserable,\u2019 \u2018Unhappy\u2019  Distraught Kushner May Want to Go Back to NYC, After Kushner was named as the \u201cperson of interest,\u201d the media quickly reported that Kushner has been \u201cmiserable,\u201d \u201cunhappy\u201d and \u201cfrustrated\u201d with his job as he has come under more scrutiny. It is as if they had these paragraphs already written, ready to be fired off at the best possible moment. The Times cited anonymous \u201cfriends\u201d who told the outlet that Kushner \u201cand his wife, Ivanka Trump, have made no   commitment to remain by Mr. Trump\u2019s side, saying they would review every six months whether to return to private life in New York. \u201d Politico reported that there is a \u201csense of uncertainty about how long Kushner and Ivanka Trump  \u2014   who associates say likes, but doesn\u2019t love, Washington  \u2014   are planning to stick it out. Some have noted that they rent their Kalorama mansion, which allows them to keep their options of moving back to Manhattan more open. \u201d On Wednesday, the Times reported that Trump \u201chas not ruled out the possibility\u201d that Kushner and Ivanka \u201cwould return to New York this year. \u201d Writing in the Guardian, Walter Shapiro predicted that Kushner\u2019s \u201clife in the coming months and maybe years will be a study in misery\u201d because \u201che will probably spend more time with his personal lawyer, Clinton justice department veteran Jamie Gorelick, than with Ivanka or his children. Whether it is an appearance under oath on Capitol Hill or the inevitable FBI interview, every sentence Kushner utters will bring with it possible legal jeopardy. \u201d Shapiro, citing Kushner\u2019s sister\u2019s   visa exploits, wrote that perhaps \u201cKushner just calculated that all the hype surrounding his White House role was a     family branding opportunity. \u201d He also suggests that Kushner may end up behind bars, if he is not careful, like his father: \u201cthe worst thing that can happen to an   real estate investor (as Trump himself knows well) is bankruptcy. When the FBI and special prosecutor Robert Mueller get involved, the penalties can theoretically involve steel bars locking behind you. \u201d If Kushner did not realize it already, he should be well aware by now that the Democrats, the institutional left, and the   establishment media seek to destroy, do not give an inch, and play for keeps. And they may just be warming up.'"}, "time": 1742564619.824725}
