Trump\u2019s official swearing in as the next president of the United States, a major symbolic victory for the outsider and billionaire businessman who crushed both of them on his way to the White House. [Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014  the former president and first lady, the latter of whom was Trump\u2019s general election opponent on Nov. 8 \u2014  will attend the inauguration, according to a report in New York Magazine.  \u201cBill and Hillary Clinton have decided to attend the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, according to two sources with knowledge of their plans,\u201d New York Magazine\u2019s Yashar Ali wrote, adding later in his short piece on Tuesday afternoon: NEW: Pres. George W. Bush  wife will attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration say they\u2019re pleased to \u201dwitness the peaceful transfer of power\u201d  \u2014   Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) January 3, 2017,  Former President Jimmy Carter, the failed Democratic president from the 1970s, will also be present \u2014  as will outgoing President Barack Obama, who will officially transfer power to Trump on Jan. 20. It\u2019s unclear whether former President George H. W. Bush, the elder Bush who succeeded the late former President Ronald Reagan, will attend. The elder Bush\u2019s health has been an issue as of late. But the fact that both the Bushes and the Clintons will be present at Trump\u2019s inauguration is a stunning development, as Trump\u2019s meteoric rise to the White House went through both dynasties. Throughout the GOP primaries, Trump mocked and ridiculed George W. Bush\u2019s younger brother former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u2014  at the time the presumed GOP frontrunner who had millions upon millions of donor class dollars funneled into his campaign \u2014  as \u201clow energy. \u201d Trump ripped Jeb Bush apart, and blew past the other GOP candidates on his way to viciously winning the nomination to face off against Hillary Clinton in the general election. There, in the general election, Trump described Clinton as \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and even called \u201cHeartless Hillary\u201d at one point. He threatened to throw her in jail for her email scandal and her Clinton Foundation scandal \u2014  something that still hasn\u2019t been ruled out in the future \u2014  as well as running one of the most vicious campaigns in American political history. He proved to be successful, winning a landslide 30 and a half states and 306 electoral votes on Nov. 8 \u2014  officially closing the chapter of U. S. history where Americans had dynasties like the Bushes and the Clintons. Trump\u2019s populist nationalist worldview once and for all defeated the globalist elitist Bushes and Clintons, and now they will witness him officially take power on Jan. 20 as Trump \u2014  the   person to be elected to the highest office in the land without ever having served in government before \u2014  takes the oath of office.'"}, "time": 1742561666.8908405}
