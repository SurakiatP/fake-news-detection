[In an interview for the Italian evening news on the   RAI network, Cardinal Parolin was asked whether the Vatican is worried about what the interviewer called \u201cthe spread of nationalism and populism not only in Europe but also in the United States with Donald Trump. \u201d  \u201cI think so, I think so,\u201d Parolin said. \u201cCertainly these closings are not a good sign,\u201d since many of them \u201care born of fear, which is not a good counsellor. \u201d The Cardinal also recalled recent comments by Pope Francis, saying that \u201cthere is a risk of history repeating itself. \u201d In a lengthy interview with the Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds in late January, Pope Francis was asked whether he was concerned about the spread of a populism that capitalizes on \u201cpeople\u2019s fears,\u201d preaching \u201ca message of hate. \u201d In his reply, Francis distinguished between a good, grassroots populism, where it is the people who are \u201cthe protagonists,\u201d and a cult of personality where a charismatic figure like Hitler rises to power and is welcomed as a savior figure. \u201cFor me the most typical example of populism in the European sense is the Germany of 1933,\u201d Francis said. After Hindenburg, \u201cGermany tries to get back up, searches for its identity, looks for a leader, someone to give it back its identity and a youngster named Adolf Hitler says, \u2018I can do it I can do it. \u2019\u201d Whereas the first sort of populism is a good thing, the latter can be very dangerous, he said. The risk, Francis said, is that in times of crisis we lack judgment and people can begin to think, \u201cLet\u2019s look for a savior who gives us back our identity and let\u2019s defend ourselves with walls,   whatever, from other people that may rob us of our identity. \u201d \u201cAnd that is a very serious thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I always try to say: talk among yourselves, talk to one another. \u201d In the same interview, the Pope was asked specifically whether he was worried about Donald Trump, whom the interviewer described as a xenophobe filled with \u201chatred for foreigners. \u201d Francis said that the new U. S. President deserved to be judged by his actions, not by \u201cprophecies\u201d of what he may or may not do. \u201cI think that we must wait and see,\u201d Francis said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to get ahead of myself nor judge people prematurely. We will see how he acts, what he does, and then I will have an opinion. \u201d The Pope said it is \u201cmost unwise\u201d to be afraid of something that might or might not happen. \u201cIt would be like prophets predicting calamities or windfalls that don\u2019t take place. We will see. We will see what he does and then evaluate,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer to wait and see,\u201d he said. Follow Thomas D.
