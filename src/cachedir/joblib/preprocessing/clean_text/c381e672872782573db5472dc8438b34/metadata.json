[In an April 13 feature, TheBigLead asked, \u201cGiven how much golf every President plays, it got us thinking: If you won or were invited to play a round of golf with President Donald Trump, would you play?\u201d  Of the eight BigLead sports reporters asked, only three answered with a \u201cyes. \u201d Those who said yes, Michael Shamburger, Jason Lisk, and, Jason McIntyre, all answered with a quick paragraph. In the case of Shamburger, he gave but a   answer in the affirmative. Ah, but those who said \u201cno\u201d had a whole lot to say to explain their petulance. Writer Ty Duffy puffed himself up as a moral warrior for refusing to play golf with Trump. In fact, Duffy said he wouldn\u2019t even deign to shake Trump\u2019s hand on or off the fairways. Next, Kyle Koster was blunt with his answer. \u201cNo,\u201d Koster huffed. \u201cI have no interest in spending any time with Donald Trump. \u201d Writer Ryan Phillips, as apparently someone smarter and more interesting than Trump, said he would not want to golf with POTUS because, \u201che just seems like someone I\u2019d have absolutely no desire to talk to or be around for hours. \u201d For his part, Stephen Douglas, who also said \u201cno,\u201d went on to insist, \u201cit\u2019s complicated. \u201d While admitting it would be quite a thing to tell a child that daddy played golf with a president, Douglas also noted that refusing to play with a president is also quite a story. Ultimately, Douglas deemed the opportunity a \u201chard pass. \u201d Finally, unlike the others, Ryan Glasspiegel  \u2014   who also said he wouldn\u2019t play  \u2014   didn\u2019t eschew the possibility because he hates Trump, but because he hates golf.
