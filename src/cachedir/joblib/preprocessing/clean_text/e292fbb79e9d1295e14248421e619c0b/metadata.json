Calhoun, the   white supremacist statesman from South Carolina. The college will be renamed for Grace Murray Hopper, a trailblazing computer scientist and Navy rear admiral who received a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate from Yale. The decision was a stark reversal of the university\u2019s decision last spring to maintain the name despite broad opposition. Though the president, Peter Salovey, said that he was still \u201cconcerned about erasing history,\u201d he said that \u201cthese are exceptional circumstances. \u201d \u201cI made this decision because I think it is the right thing to do on principle,\u201d Mr. Salovey said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cJohn C. Calhoun\u2019s principles, his legacy as an ardent supporter of slavery as a positive good, are at odds with this university. \u201d Mr. Salovey and the other members of the Yale Corporation, the university\u2019s governing body, made their decision after an advisory committee unanimously recommended the renaming. The school is still determining when exactly the change will be carried out, but Mr. Salovey said it would be by fall at the latest. Students reacted with joy to a change many said was long overdue. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge sense of relief and celebration,\u201d said Rianna   21, a senior from Ann Arbor, Mich. who was involved in the protests. \u201cStudents of color have been fighting for this change for decades and it\u2019s hard to believe this day is finally here. \u201d Online, some students found inspiration in a quotation from Ms. Hopper, who died in 1992. \u201cHumans are allergic to change,\u201d she once said. \u201cThey love to say, \u2018We\u2019ve always done it this way.\u2019 I try to fight that. \u201d Calhoun, the nation\u2019s seventh vice president, attended Yale and was its valedictorian. The name of the college incited controversy almost as soon as it opened in 1933. Many black students staged demonstrations and referred to the college, which was decorated with depictions of slaves carrying bales of cotton, as the \u201cCalhoun Plantation. \u201d Opposition may have peaked in 2015, after the massacre of nine worshipers at a black church in Charleston. The killings, by an avowed white supremacist, prompted protests that led to the removal of the Confederate battle flag outside the South Carolina Statehouse and elsewhere. Yale was seized that fall by a series of demonstrations from students, faculty and alumni who objected to the Calhoun name, as well as to what they saw as a larger climate of racial inequality on campus. Many universities, domestic and abroad, have faced similar pressure in recent years to eradicate names and symbols of racism and colonialism on campus. That resistance notwithstanding, Mr. Salovey announced last April that Yale would preserve the Calhoun name. At the same time, he revealed that the university\u2019s two new residential colleges would be named for Benjamin Franklin and Anna Pauline Murray. The honoring of Ms. Murray, a legal scholar and civil rights activist who graduated from Yale Law School in 1965, was widely hailed as the first such distinction bestowed on either a woman or an  . But the selection of Franklin, who was once a slaveholder himself, was derided by many students, particularly after it became clear that he was chosen in deference to a suggestion by Charles B. Johnson, a businessman who donated $250 million for the new buildings  \u2014   the largest gift in the school\u2019s history. Addressing a related concern, the school also decided then that the leaders of the residential colleges would no longer use the title \u201cmaster,\u201d and would instead be called \u201cheads of college,\u201d a recognition of the discomfort many students felt toward the previous honorific\u2019s evocation of slavery. The Calhoun and Franklin decisions reignited protests from student activists, who held a \u201crenaming ceremony\u201d in front of the college in which they called it \u201cthe college formerly known as Calhoun. \u201d At a town   meeting soon after, students showered Mr. Salovey with fake $1 million bills, a protest against what they saw as the university prioritizing its financial interests over their concerns. The dissent did not come only from students. Over the summer, a black dishwasher in Calhoun smashed a stained glass windowpane that depicted slaves working on a plantation, because he said he found the image degrading. And on Friday, four demonstrators protesting the Calhoun name were arrested for blocking the street. Still, despite their delight about the renaming, many students hope that the university will continue to move beyond symbolism to address more pressing issues of racial inequality on campus, like the dearth of black faculty members. During the fall 2015 protests, the university announced that it was committing $50 million to a   initiative to confront the fact that less than 3 percent of its arts and sciences faculty is black. But since that time, several prominent black professors have left the university. About 11 percent of Yale\u2019s roughly 5, 400 undergraduates identify themselves as black or  . \u201cThis is definitely a victory, but we\u2019re not done fighting,\u201d Ms.   said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to keep pushing Yale in the right direction. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563085.1141348}
