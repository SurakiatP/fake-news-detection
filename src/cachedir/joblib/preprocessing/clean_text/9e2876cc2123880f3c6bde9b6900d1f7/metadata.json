Those who do not closely follow the world of conservative social media might be moved to ask, who? Fair question. Mr. Cernovich is a blogger, author of books, YouTube personality and filmmaker with a   social media following. Much of his online persona is driven by two mottos: \u201cconflict is attention\u201d and \u201cattention is influence. \u201d He told The New Yorker, \u201cI use trolling tactics to build my brand. \u201d Before this week, he was perhaps best known for promoting false claims that Hillary Clinton was part of a pedophile ring located in the basement of a pizzeria. He describes himself as an \u201cAmerican nationalist\u201d and has been involved in shaping   messages on social media, according to The New Yorker. But he has denied being part of the   movement, calling it \u201ctoo obsessed with gossip and drama for my tastes\u201d in a blog post. \u201cUntil the right wins for once, I have no interest in arguing with the   or disavowing anyone,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnce the right has some actual power, then it will be time to have an ideological civil war. \u201d This has been a busy few days for Mr. Cernovich, who lately has been promoted by people close to the president more than once. A day before the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, for example, Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to the president, shared a link to an interview Mr. Cernovich recently gave to CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes. \u201d Mr. Cernovich started out several years ago as a men\u2019s   writer whose work disdained feminism and promoted a message of men\u2019s empowerment that often dwelled on the question of how to meet women (He is now married with an infant daughter). His advice to straight men, the subject of a book and video talks: Men should be dominant alpha males and embrace a \u201cgorilla mindset\u201d when dealing with the opposite sex. He has long been criticized for his argument that date rape is a liberal fiction. In a blog post published last October, he called it a \u201charmful concept for men and women\u201d that leads to false rape accusations. \u201cLying about being in love to sleep with someone isn\u2019t rape,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGetting played isn\u2019t rape. Regret isn\u2019t rape. Thinking, \u2018I might have been date raped,\u2019 means you weren\u2019t raped. \u201d Mr. Cernovich now focuses mainly on politics. From his base in Southern California, he has become influential in parts of social media, helping to shape the   narrative. He uses a steady stream of tweets and videos to promote conspiracy theories and factually incorrect claims that he bills as   journalism. During the presidential campaign, for example, he doggedly promoted false stories that claimed Mrs. Clinton had serious ailments like Parkinson\u2019s disease. He also argued that she was linked to a nonexistent pedophile sex cult located in the basement of a pizzeria in Washington, D. C. That conspiracy theory, known as #PizzaGate, spread widely online and inspired a   man to show up at the restaurant to investigate the claims (he was arrested). Mr. Cernovich insisted the conspiracy was true in an hourlong YouTube video that also claimed most people employed by the news media and \u201cevery   actor\u201d in Hollywood were also pedophiles. During his recent \u201c60 Minutes\u201d appearance, Mr. Cernovich said that he never named the pizzeria at the center of the #Pizzagate conspiracy theory and called the shooting a \u201cvery unfortunate thing. \u201d He also said his claims about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health were based on an anonymous tip sent to him by a doctor who had never examined Mrs. Clinton before and had no access to her medical records. Nevertheless, he stood behind his claims. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely not fake,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not lies at all. 100 percent true. \u201d In a blog post published on Sunday, Mr. Cernovich wrote \u201cthe White House Counsel\u2019s office identified\u201d Susan E. Rice, President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, \u201cas the person responsible for the unmasking\u201d Trump associates who were caught up in the electronic surveillance of foreigners. Similar reports were published by other news organizations. \u201cUnmasking\u201d is the process by which a   official, such as a national security adviser, requests the identity of a person whose name has been blacked out in an intelligence report. It does not mean leaking that information to a third party. Donald Trump Jr. praised Mr. Cernovich\u2019s post on Twitter and said he was the first person to publish this information. In an email on Tuesday, the president\u2019s son declined to answer questions on the record about Mr. Cernovich or his blog post. Ms. Rice denied any wrongdoing in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday. She said she sometimes asked the identities of American citizens whose names had been redacted from intelligence reports because she needed that information to properly understand the context of the reports. She said it was part of doing her job and was \u201cabsolutely not for any political purpose, to spy, expose, anything. \u201d \u201cI leaked nothing to nobody and never have and never would,\u201d Ms. Rice said in the interview. After the president\u2019s son tweeted about him, Mr. Cernovich said he was inundated with media requests, which he gleefully rejected one by one in a rambling live YouTube monologue. Holding his infant daughter in his arms, Mr. Cernovich derided the media as a cabal of \u201ctrust fund kids\u201d and \u201ctrash. \u201d \u201cThey have no idea what it\u2019s like to struggle the way I struggle and the way the working class struggles, and that\u2019s why I am a hero of the working class,\u201d he said. He added that he would not respond to media requests. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be your friends. I don\u2019t respond to your emails. \u201d But Mr. Cernovich did respond to a direct message from me on Twitter asking about the Susan Rice blog post on Tuesday evening. In the reply, he denied that the White House Counsel\u2019s Office had been the source for his blog post about Ms. Rice, even though it said as much in the second paragraph. \u201cI never mentioned sources in my original report and disavow any reports that I have sources within the White House,\u201d he said. He also twice suggested that I buy his book \u201cGorilla Mindset. \u201d In that exchange and subsequent public tweets that included screen shots of his   replies, he also criticized The Times and some of its reporters by name, implied that the Mexican billionaire and Times shareholder Carlos Slim has a role in news coverage (he does not) and generally attacked the integrity of its journalists, living and dead, and its journalism, past, present and future. During his YouTube broadcast on Tuesday, Mr. Cernovich denied accusations from critics that he is a misogynist, a rape apologist or a white nationalist. He said his past statements had been taken out of context and called some of them \u201cobvious satire\u201d that had been misinterpreted in bad faith. \u201cNobody tells you how to be famous,\u201d he said. Later, shortly before appearing on a talk show hosted by Alex Jones, another   conspiracy theorist, Mr. Cernovich said he did not care if the media portrayed him positively or not. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he said, speaking into the camera. \u201cI did this to Susan Rice. I did this to Hillary Clinton. I\u2019m doing real journalism. I\u2019m destroying your fake news outlets. Look at me. Look at my face. I\u2019m the media now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562105.2882147}
