It\u2019s the Jews\u2019 fault in Germany,\u2019\u201d he pontificated, before adding ominously, \u201cCharles Lindbergh led them. \u201d \u201cIt is a term, as he defined it his way, but the words themselves carry very ugly echoes in our history,\u201d said Moran, serving notice the new President that he must carefully consider the psychotic delusions of paranoid ABC News reporters before choosing his every word. Apparently Trump can explain what he means a million times without exorcising the ghost of Charles Lindbergh from certain imaginations. This is an especially outrageous charge to level at Trump when his inauguration included the first benediction from an Orthodox rabbi ever, and the first Jewish prayer since Ronald Reagan\u2019s second inaugural. Not only that, but Rabbi Marvin Hier is the head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. He\u2019s probably a lot better than Terry Moran at detecting actual  . Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka converted to Orthodox Judaism before she was married to Jared Kushner in 2009. Trump declared himself \u201cglad\u201d about her decision in public. He\u2019s also been very public about his support for Israel, including his intention to move the U. S. embassy to Jerusalem. His predecessor, Barack Obama, closed out his second term with a spectacular betrayal of Israel at the United Nations, winning loud applause from people openly pledged to murdering Jews. Did that make Terry Moran\u2019s   detector twitch a bit?  People who listened to Trump\u2019s speech probably found it a nice change of pace to have an American president who thinks the needs of the American people come first for a change, just as most other world leaders tend to work for the best interests of their respective nations.  While they were having these thoughts, squads of     were smashing windows, blocking traffic, and assaulting police officers across Washington, D. C. If they had Terry Moran\u2019s finely tuned sense of historical irony, they\u2019d have been wearing brown shirts instead of black. Moran didn\u2019t invent this smear  \u2014   many other Trump critics have previously accused him of using \u201cAmerica first\u201d language to send coded messages to   or of witlessly using the phrase without understanding its pedigree. Some of the same people think Trump deliberately quoted the Batman supervillain Bane in his inaugural speech.'"}, "time": 1742561796.702769}
