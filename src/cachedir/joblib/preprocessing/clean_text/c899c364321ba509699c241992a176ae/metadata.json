He even placed his own book just behind it. \u201c[The Art of the Deal] is my second favorite book of all time,\u201d said Trump. \u201cDo you know what my first is? The Bible! Nothing beats the Bible,\u201d he added to applause. \\nThe feigned adoration for the Christian holy book was undone by the fact that Trump had quite literally never shown an interest in religion prior to that moment, couldn\u2019t name a single New Testament passage when pressed, and years earlier once remarked that he didn\u2019t believe adultery \u2013 one of the Ten Commandments \u2013 was a sin. \\nNow that Trump is the nominee and Christian conservatives have stood by him despite his disgusting hate campaign and torrent of sexual assault allegations, he\u2019s apparently feeling a bit more confident. He doesn\u2019t need to fake it anymore. It was fun while it lasted! \\nWhen asked by Extra \u2018s A.J. Calloway what his favorite books were, Trump seemingly forgot that \u201cnothing beats the Bible.\u201d He put his own books back on top. When given a \u201crapid fire\u201d quiz about his two favorite books, without hesitation Trump went with \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d and \u201cSurviving at the Top,\u201d both of which were written by ghostwriters but with Trump getting a byline. \\nIt\u2019s particularly interesting that Trump with \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d considering the man responsible for writing it has since disavowed Trump and now acts as his biggest critic . \\n\u201cI put lipstick on a pig,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.\u201d He went on, \u201cI genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.\u201d \\nAs with every answer Trump gives off-the-cuff, this one is very revealing. Here is a man so caught up in worshiping himself that when asked what his favorite book is he can only think of the ones with his own name on the covers. It really does say everything about his personality. \\nWatch Trump bumble his answer below: \\nFeatured image via Extra'"}, "time": 1742563721.273991}
