Trump said on Thursday that the pastor who interrupted his remarks at an   church in Flint, Mich. was \u201ca nervous mess\u201d when she introduced him and that he thought \u201csomething was up\u201d with her. During his visit to Bethel United Methodist Church on Wednesday, Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, started to assail his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for being a failure. As he spoke, the Rev. Faith Green Timmons came over to him and said, \u201cMr. Trump, I invited you here to thank us,\u201d and added, \u201cnot make a political speech. \u201d Mr. Trump addressed the awkward exchange in an interview on Fox News on Thursday, suggesting that Pastor Timmons had a political agenda. \u201cEveryone plays their games, it doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Mr. Trump said, claiming Pastor Timmons was shaking when she came up to him. He added: \u201cShe was so nervous, she was like a nervous mess. I figured something was up. \u201d Some conservatives defended Mr. Trump on Thursday, pointing to a Facebook post in which she wrote that the visit was an opportunity to educate Republican candidate as evidence that she was planning to embarrass him. While that post does not appear on her Facebook page, Pastor Timmons did address the controversy there on Wednesday night. \u201cHad he stuck to what his camp claimed he came to do, we would not have had a problem!\u201d she wrote. Mr. Trump has shown more discipline on the campaign trail in recent weeks, but his criticism of the pastor demonstrated that he is still willing to push back against perceived slights. Mr. Trump also allowed himself to belittle Mrs. Clinton\u2019s recent illness at a rally on Wednesday night, suggesting that she could not stand for such an event and that she was probably \u201clying in bed. \u201d After the interruption at the church, Mr. Trump went on to discuss the economic situation in Flint. He said on Thursday that most of the people who attended the event at the church welcomed him warmly. \u201cThe audience was saying \u2018let him speak, let him speak,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe audience was so great. \u201d But a pool reporter who was traveling Mr. Trump disputed his account, describing a scene where several members of the audience actually heckled Mr. Trump and questioned him about reports that he had discriminated against black people as a landlord. According to the pool report, Pastor Timmons defended Mr. Trump and told the crowd that he was \u201ca guest of my church and you will defend him. \u201d Mrs. Clinton, in North Carolina on Thursday, lamented Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on Pastor Timmons, saying it was unwarranted. \u201cHe called her a nervous mess,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference. \u201cThat\u2019s not only insulting, it\u2019s dead wrong. \u201d She added: \u201cShe\u2019s a rock for her community in trying times. She deserves better, and Flint deserves better  \u2014   in fact, so does America. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561895.3246222}
