[According to the Hollywood Reporter, UTA CEO Jeremy Zimmer informed agency staff of the change in a letter this week.  The company  \u2014   home to   clients like Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Mariah Carey, Toby Keith and dozens of others  \u2014   also plans to donate $250, 000 to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has worked to oppose President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily prohibiting immigration from seven countries, and to the International Rescue Committee. \u201cThis is a moment that demands our generosity, awareness and restlessness,\u201d Zimmer reportedly wrote to his staff. \u201cOur world is a better place for the free exchange of artists, ideas and creative expression. If our nation ceases to be the place where artists the world over can come to express themselves freely, then we cease, in my opinion, to be America. \u201d The move to cancel the glitzy annual Oscars party comes as Hollywood has become increasingly vocal about Trump\u2019s policy proposals and executive actions, particularly his action on immigration. At the Screen Actors Guild Awards last month, several film and television stars used their acceptance speeches to speak out against Trump\u2019s order actress Sarah Paulson specifically called for donations to the ACLU. THR further reported that Ari Emanuel,   of   and UTA competitor   sent an email to staff Wednesday notifying them that the company would be forming a political action committee, though it wasn\u2019t immediately clear on what the PAC would focus. \u201cThis company\u2019s greatest asset is the diversity of our backgrounds and beliefs,\u201d Emanuel wrote to the agency. \u201cPlease know that we will do everything in our power to support and protect this diversity now and in the months and years ahead. \u201d   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742628546.940397}
