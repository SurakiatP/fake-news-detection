At the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Monday night, Bill and Chelsea Clinton, along with Chelsea\u2019s husband, Marc Mezvinsky, were on one side of the room the extended Trump clan on the other. Ivanka Trump, 34, was, as usual, first among equals in a petal pink dress that drew focus from Melania\u2019s slinky black, followed by Ivanka\u2019s two adult brothers, Donald Jr. 38, and Eric, 32. But from a select position on the aisle, Tiffany Trump, 22, elegant in a navy sheath with lace d\u00e9colletage, beamed up at the stage  \u2014   for once distinctly visible to her father at the podium and to the world. For much of the campaign, except for a brief speech at the Republican National Convention, Tiffany  \u2014   Donald J. Trump\u2019s daughter with his former wife Marla Maples  \u2014   has been the   Trump, off to the side in family photos and missing from the campaign trail and that   spooky ad aimed at the millennial vote. She was left out of the biographical documentary of Mr. Trump shown at that convention and was unmentioned in news articles that detail the advice his three older children are doling out as the race gets tighter. When Greta van Susteren did a   special on the Trump family on Fox News this summer, \u201cMeet the Trumps,\u201d with    interviews with Melania, Ivanka and his two adult sons, the only reference to their missing half sister was, \u201cThere is also Tiffany Trump, who keeps a low profile. \u201d Gossip columns have called her the Jan Brady of the Trump family. As the campaign grapples with the   firestorm Mr. Trump started by   a former Miss Universe, his youngest daughter may be around a lot more. He could use an extra young woman in his corner. Mr. Trump\u2019s team appears to be grooming Tiffany  \u2014   gingerly  \u2014   to pitch in on the campaign trail in the coming weeks, particularly with millennials. Her Instagram feed, which in the past was dotted with party shots of her and a group of close friends who have been called the \u201cSnap Pack,\u201d has been cleaned up, and her Twitter account largely restricted to campaign photos and a   pitch by Tiffany, and steering clear of any   controversies. (Though Tiffany was called out this week by Jing Daily, a Chinese luxury goods trade website, because at the debate she wore a dress by a young Chinese designer, Taoray Wang, while her father was on stage bashing China.) Tiffany, according to her mother, has felt wounded by the media depictions of her as the forgotten Trump and is eager to help out on her father\u2019s campaign as it heads into its final six weeks. \u201cShe\u2019d like to get to know her father better and spend time with him like his other children did: by going to his office and watching him work,\u201d Ms. Maples said in a recent phone interview. \u201cOnly now, he\u2019s not in the office anymore. He\u2019s on the campaign trail. \u201d Ms. Maples raised Tiffany as a single mother in Los Angeles and now lives about a mile from her only daughter in Manhattan. Tiffany seems intent on living up to Mr. Trump\u2019s expectations. And like her older half sister, Ivanka, Tiffany reflects well on her father and mirrors his idealized  . The real estate developer is the first to admit he was not exactly a helicopter parent. Instead, Mr. Trump raised helicopter offspring: adult children who hover, dote and praise unstintingly. It\u2019s possible Mr. Trump won his children\u2019s allegiance by following the French theory of child rearing, expounded in \u201cBringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9\u201d and other   books that recommend strict rules and restrained doses of attention. Then again, there is an even larger body of literature about the narcissistic parent. \u201cTiffany has always been a very special person, very confident, very driven, always the hardest worker and not bashful about it,\u201d Ivanka, 34, said in a phone interview. \u201cA lot of people are happy to get by without doing a lot of work, or work hard and pretend they don\u2019t. She is proud of her work. \u201d Like Ivanka, Tiffany went to her father\u2019s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania likes fashion and is dating someone whose family is in real estate: Ross Mechanic, a senior at Penn, the son of Jonathan Mechanic, a real estate attorney. (Ivanka is married to the real estate scion Jared Kushner.) Tiffany Trump attended a private school in Calabasas, Calif. alongside the Kardashians but without close contact with her father. \u201cI had the blessing of raising her pretty much on my own,\u201d Ms. Maples said. There, the Trump name wasn\u2019t as well known as it is in New York, and Tiffany was shielded from the kind of tabloid attention that dogged his older children during their parents\u2019 sensational divorce. Donald Jr. Ivanka and Eric are from Mr. Trump\u2019s first marriage to the   Ivana Barron, 10, is his son with his wife Melania. Like her older siblings, Tiffany spoke with aplomb on her father\u2019s behalf at the Republican Convention in Cleveland, describing him as her mentor, her role model and a caring, attentive parent. Like them, Tiffany didn\u2019t give many concrete examples. She said she saved all her report cards because she treasured the \u201csweet notes\u201d he wrote on them, even though more often it\u2019s the parent who holds on to memorabilia. She recalled that when a beloved relative died (her grandmother\u2019s fianc\u00e9) he was the first to phone her. Apparently, the telephone is the paternal umbilical cord when growing up Trump. In interviews and digital campaign ads, Ivanka, Don Jr. and Tiffany describe how engaged and loving their powerful, busy father was by saying he always accepted their calls at the office. To outsiders, however, that may seem faint praise given Mr. Trump\u2019s lifelong alacrity for getting on the phone with reporters. Ms. Maples said that when Mr. Trump called to console Tiffany about the death in the Maples family and invited his grieving daughter to visit him in New York, she urged Tiffany to go. \u201cIt gave him a chance to see her as a real person and not just a happy, smiling little girl,\u201d she said. Mr. Trump takes credit for his children\u2019s sunny devotion. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a very good father,\u201d he told Anderson Cooper in a Trump family interview this summer on CNN. \u201cThey come to me, friends of mine, very successful people, and their children have problems with drugs and problems with alcohol and problems with a lot of things, and they say: \u2018Could you speak to my son? Could you speak to my daughter?\u2019 And I\u2019m always very honored to do that. \u201d When asked to describe his youngest daughter, Mr. Trump replied by email: \u201cTiffany is a tremendous young woman with a big and beautiful heart. She was always a great student and a very popular person no matter where she went. I am incredibly proud of Tiffany and how well she has done.  \u2014   DJT. \u201d (Tiffany did not consent to be interviewed for this article, although she did pose for its photo shoot. Instead, the campaign delivered a list of approved contacts. Other family friends who were not on the list said they were instructed not to speak without authorization.) Outside acquaintances echo that she is more serious than she looks on social media. \u201cShe didn\u2019t seem like a party girl at all,\u201d Carson Griffith, a writer who followed the Snap Pack around the Hamptons in 2015 for Du Jour magazine. (Ms. Griffith also occasionally writes for The New York Times.) \u201cShe stayed in the city Friday night to finish a paper, and I never saw her drink a glass of wine. \u201d Ms. Griffith was impressed by Tiffany\u2019s good manners: \u201cWhen I would ask about her, she would say: \u2018How about you? What\u2019s your job like? \u2019\u201d Tiffany\u2019s vacations were mostly spent on trips with her mother  \u2014   a mix of fun   getaways and   tours overseas, like handing out vitamin C pops at an orphanage in Malawi. A bodyguard went with her on visits to her Georgia relatives, but otherwise she blended easily in her mother\u2019s small hometown. Sometimes, her celebrity status poked through. Recalling a party for    Janice Kiker, a close family friend in Dalton, Ga. said: \u201cTiffany showed up in a faded,   tutu. I was shocked. \u201d She added with a laugh: \u201cThen someone told me it had belonged to Shirley Temple. I said, \u2018Never mind. \u2019\u201d Lara Trump, who is married to Eric, said Mr. Trump is close to all his children. \u201cI was struck when I first came into this family how much he is their dad,\u201d she said by phone while campaigning for her    in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cIn public, he\u2019s a performer. Behind closed doors, he is polite and respectful and wants to hear from other people,\u201d Lara Trump said. She noted that Mr. Trump and Tiffany have a \u201cfun and loving relationship\u201d and that \u201che is very proud of her. \u201d Some observers have a less benign view of Mr. Trump\u2019s rapport with his children. \u201cI can say with real confidence that he spent virtually no time with them when they were young,\u201d said Tony Schwartz, who shadowed the real estate developer for 18 months to ghostwrite Mr. Trump\u2019s 1987 best seller, \u201cTrump: The Art of The Deal. \u201d Mr. Schwartz said in a recent article in The New Yorker that he now regrets the book and his role in promoting Mr. Trump. \u201cOn the rare times Ivana brought one or two of the children to his office, he couldn\u2019t have been less interested,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. That wasn\u2019t entirely true with Tiffany, Ms. Maples said. When Tiffany was a baby at    he would occasionally snatch her up and carry her as he talked to electricians and carpenters building a club health spa. Tiffany was too young to remember. \u201cI kept pictures for her to prove it,\u201d her mother said. (She also confirmed that Tiffany was named for one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite deals: the air rights he bought above the landmark store to build Trump Tower.) Growing up, Tiffany mostly saw her father on spring break at    though Mr. Trump visited her on occasion as well. \u201cWhenever Tiffany got an award, he would fly to California to see her get it,\u201d Mrs. Kiker said. As a teenager, Tiffany seemed interested in having a show business career like her mother. She took acting lessons with her mother\u2019s coach, and in 2011 she recorded a pop song, \u201cLike a Bird. \u201d College brought Tiffany closer to her father  \u2014   and her half sister. Ivanka arranged for her to have a summer internship at Vogue. After graduating last June, Tiffany spent her summer months on a paid internship in communications at Warby Parker, the eyewear company, and is studying to take the law school entrance exams. Tiffany seems intent on staying close to her centripetal father. \u201cLaw school completely makes sense,\u201d said Lara Maggs, a close friend from Penn. Ms. Maggs described \u201cTiff\u201d as a study grind who is driven to prove herself. \u201cA law degree would bring added value to a really accomplished family,\u201d she said. The Trump children aren\u2019t the only famous scions with a rich, successful parent. Chelsea Clinton is also enmeshed in the family business. \u201cThere are instances where demonstrating family loyalty  \u2014   family love  \u2014   means upholding a core identity around wealth,\u201d said Jamie Johnson, a filmmaker and heir to the Johnson  Johnson fortune, who made \u201cBorn Rich,\u201d a 2003 documentary about his cohorts, including Ivanka. \u201cThe more public the family, the greater the emotional responsibility to uphold the public image,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. Donald Jr. and Ivanka Trump are not only consiglieri in their father\u2019s company and his campaign, they were regulars on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and stressed how hard they had to work in business to earn their father\u2019s trust. They were privileged, but not spoiled or entitled, Ivanka said. Certainly, compared to some of their more dissipated, profligate peers in the top 0. 01 percent, the Trump children are remarkably on message. In that family interview with Anderson Cooper, Tiffany batted back a suggestion that her father was condescending and even insulting to women. \u201cHe has the utmost faith that we can accomplish whatever we set our minds to,\u201d she said, speaking of Ivanka and herself, \u201cjust as well as men, if not more so. \u201d Even Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t always sure his children would flourish under his oversize shadow. \u201cStatistically, my children have a very bad shot,\u201d Mr. Trump told Playboy in 1990. \u201cChildren of successful people are generally very, very troubled, not successful. \u201d There are not many hints of dissent or rebellion in the pack. After Mr. Trump left Ivana for Ms. Maples, Don Jr. didn\u2019t speak to his father for a period of time. Now, if anything, Don Jr. models himself a little too closely to his father: He posts recklessly on Twitter on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, most recently comparing Middle Eastern refugees to Skittles candy. Tiffany\u2019s friends say that she doesn\u2019t take her father\u2019s wealth for granted, despite some   social media posts from a year ago. (One is a   of a bowl of caviar.) \u201cUnless she\u2019s with her dad, she\u2019s happy to fly coach,\u201d said Lara Maggs, her friend from Penn. \u201cWhen we flew together from Philly, we were in the middle seats at the back of the plane. \u201d She said that the day before Tiffany flew to the convention, she bought the blue dress she wore for her speech at Bloomingdale\u2019s off a sales rack. Ivanka said she didn\u2019t want to expose her little sister to the klieg lights of the presidential campaign before she is ready. \u201cShe will not do it if she is not comfortable with it,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody is pushing her. \u201d She added, indignantly, \u201cPeople refer to us as surrogates, but we are his children. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562123.9521377}
