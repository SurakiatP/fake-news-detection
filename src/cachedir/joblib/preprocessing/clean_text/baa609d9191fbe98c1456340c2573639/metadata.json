Dyer reports that a sickening 13,000 late-term abortions are carried out every year in the U.S. and at the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday night, Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton explained away her support of murdering children via late-term and partial birth abortions with the incorrect claim that the \u201clife and health of the mother\u201d is often at stake in such cases. \\n\u201cThe kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make,\u201d Clinton said at the debate, referencing health risks to mothers and fetal anomalies to justify her extreme position. \\nLila Rose, pro-life activist and founder of Live Action, wrote for the Hill in response to Clinton\u2019s dangerous and incorrect statements: \\nThe first problem with Clinton\u2019s claim is that research published by the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute found that abortions for fetal abnormalities \u201cmake up a small minority\u201d of late-term abortions, and those that are purported to be done to save the mother\u2019s life are an even smaller number. Even more problematic for Clinton, over 1,000 medical professionals have concluded that abortion is never medically necessary to save a mother\u2019s life. While a life-saving treatment for a mother may result in the death of her preborn child, that treatment\u2019s purpose is not to kill the baby. For example, removing a mother\u2019s fallopian tube in the case of an ectopic pregnancy, or inducing labor later in pregnancy to achieve better outcomes for both baby and mother is not abortion. Not being able to save someone because we lack the technology to do so is entirely different from intentionally killing them. Abortion is an intentional killing, and that is always a grave injustice. \\nRose went on to note how disturbing it is that Clinton would justify the murder of a child because he or she has a medical condition. Down Syndrome Awareness Month of October is being celebrated by millions of people as Clinton justified their murder because someone decided they aren\u2019t worthy of life. \\nAbortion is legal throughout all nine months of pregnancy in the U.S. for certain exceptions \u2014 a fact that many people might not know and would be appalled to find out. As Rose reported, some states have restrictions on the barbaric practice, but seven states and the District of Columbia allow abortion for any reason at any time in the pregnancy. \\nRose discussed the barbarism that is late-term and partial-birth abortion: \\nMost late-term abortions are induction abortions, committed by using a long needle to pierce a baby\u2019s brain or heart to deliver a lethal dose of digoxin, which causes cardiac arrest. The baby is then delivered stillborn two to three days later. You can see a medically accurate animation of this procedure presented by former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino here . \\nThe federal law banning partial-birth abortions (which Clinton voted against as a senator because she said it was too strict) still allows for the abortionist to partially deliver a child \u2014 with her legs dangling outside of her mother or most of her head being delivered \u2014 before he kills her. But for the abortionist waiting to take the child\u2019s life as she moves through the birth canal, the child is only seconds away from taking her first breath and having full legal protection. \\nClinton supports this horrific practice and Planned Parenthood \u2014 which kills 320,000 babies a year as the largest abortion chain in the country \u2014 supports her candidacy in return. Planned Parenthood has given $30 million to the Clinton campaign in an effort to save the $500 million in taxpayer subsidies they receive to wage war on the preborn and the moral dignity of this nation.'"}, "time": 1742561804.9726894}
