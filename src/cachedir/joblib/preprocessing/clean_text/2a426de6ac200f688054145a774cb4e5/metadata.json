According to city manager Steven Falk, the overbearing presence of cruisers is impacting tenants in the building, affecting their ability to park their own vehicles. \\nIn a council meeting earlier this week, Blomstrand referenced \u201ca growing force and too many police cars crammed into his property\u201d as reasons for evicting the department. \\nEach tenant gets ten parking spaces, but the department is using forty. \\nDesco Plaza owner Curt Blomstrand has told the department that it must leave as soon as its lease ends at the end of the year.
