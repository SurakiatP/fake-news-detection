If they are convicted? No problem,\u201d Mr. Duterte said. \u201cThey can call me and say they have been convicted, and I\u2019ll tell the judge to pardon them all. \u201d He said the officers would be not only reinstated, but also promoted. Mr. Duterte\u2019s comments were criticized by opposition leaders and human rights groups, who have accused him of abusing his powers in a monthslong crackdown on drug dealers and users that has left thousands of people dead. Leila de Lima, a senator and former rights commissioner who was jailed in February on what she says are   charges, said Mr. Duterte\u2019s pledge to free the police officers was \u201cextremely disturbing. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crass impunity,\u201d Ms. de Lima said in a statement smuggled out of jail. Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino, an opposition leader, said Mr. Duterte\u2019s comments meant there were some \u201cindividuals and groups who are above the law. \u201d He added: \u201cIt would be better to let justice takes its course before issuing promises. \u201d The 19 officers were arrested after the November shooting death of Rolando Espinosa Sr. the mayor of Albuera, a town in the central Visayas region. Mr. Espinosa was killed in his jail cell after being arrested on a drugs charge in October. Mr. Duterte had accused him of being one of 150 local officials involved in the drug trade. The officers, led by Marvin Marcos, a police superintendent, have claimed that a gunfight broke out in the provincial jail after the mayor pulled a gun, which he had concealed in his cell, on the men who were there to serve a search warrant. Mr. Espinosa was the second politician on Mr. Duterte\u2019s list killed by officers in less than two weeks. In October, another mayor, Samsudin Dimaukom, was gunned down by police officers after reportedly firing at them at a checkpoint. A Senate investigation into Mr. Espinosa\u2019s death said both mayors had been killed under \u201csuspicious circumstances. \u201d The Senate report said 19 officers were guilty of a \u201cgrave abuse of authority,\u201d adding that Mr. Espinosa\u2019s death appeared to be premeditated and carried out by people who wanted him silenced. Despite these findings, Mr. Duterte has stood by the officers and insisted that scores of mayors and village chiefs, including Mr. Espinosa, have profited from the drug trade. \u201cWhy do you grieve for the son of a bitch?\u201d Mr. Duterte asked on Friday at an event commemorating Women\u2019s Day at the presidential palace. \u201cHe destroyed half of the Visayas. How many have been left crazy and unattended, their family already gone? Then you grieve for this idiot who was killed inside his cell,\u201d he said, adding an expletive. Mr. Duterte said it was well within his presidential powers to grant conditional or absolute pardons with agreement from Congress, which is controlled by a majority of his allies. The case highlights Mr. Duterte\u2019s attempts to silence and kill not only criminals actively involved in the drugs trade, but also leaders who may oppose his policies and tactics.'"}, "time": 1742561732.1263833}
