And now that the nation is within 10 days of electing or rejecting her as the next president of the United States, the announcement has proven to be a true October surprise. \\nPerhaps millions of Americans were holding their breath as FBI Director James Comey, on July 5th, 2016 , made the following statement to the American people. \u201cFrom the group of 30,000 e-mails returned to the State Department, 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined \u2026 to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were \u201cup-classified\u201d to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.\u201d \\nThe admission that former Secretary of State Clinton had, indeed, sent and received classified information on her now infamous server was contrary to her repeated claims she\u2019d done no such thing. Nonetheless, Comey chose not to recommend an indictment be issued for her arrest, leaving many scratching their heads in disbelief. \\nEven Comey\u2019s former boss, former mayor of NYC Riudi Giuliani said Comey got it wrong. And Trey Gowdy (R-SC), chair of the Select Committee on Benghazi, hauled Comey\u2019s behind back in front of Congress to explain why Comey insisted because Clinton didn\u2019t intend to commit a crime, she shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted. Over and over again, Comey has had to explain his decision not to indict the then Democratic nominee for president. And Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) stated in September Comey had created a double standard by doling out immunity deals to several of Clinton\u2019s staffers, amid ongoing investigations in the Clinton email scandal. \\nNow enter the disgraced former House member Anthony Weiner, and Comey\u2019s letter to several members of Congress. The director of the FBI informed various committee members, in no uncertain terms, that he is reopening the Clinton email case as he was made aware of the \u201cexistence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d \\nAccording to Comey\u2019s letter, the new emails were discovered while the FBI was investigating an, \u201cunrelated case.\u201d So what does Weiner have to do with anything? \\nAs Fox News reported, \u201cAn FBI source \u2026 confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced ex-Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman.\u201d That \u201cunrelated case,\u201d as Comey described it to congressional members, supposedly involves Weiner sexting photos of his wanker to a 15-year-old female from North Carolina, as reported by The Atlantic. \\nBut that\u2019s all we know at this point, which leads to speculation. It\u2019s no secret that Abedin and Weiner are in Splitsville , with Abedin filing for divorce over Weiner\u2019s insatiable sexting habits. But what\u2019s more important to consider is that Weiner now has motivation to tell all that he knows. Let\u2019s face it, his derriere is facing some serious punishment in jail, and he may be willing to cut a deal with federal prosecutors to minimize any potential sentencing. \\nThere\u2019s no question Weiner had access, over the years, to the kind of pillow talk which could implicate Clinton. Let\u2019s face it! He was sleeping with Clinton\u2019s closest confidante . And what this email scandal case has needed and hasn\u2019t gotten until this point, is someone willing to talk, AKA a \u201crat\u201d. If Weiner turns out to be the rat investigators are looking for, he may be willing to tell all he knows. And who knows where that will lead? Since Abedin has been working for Clinton since 1996, if anyone has any new incriminating evidence on Clinton, it\u2019s almost certain to be Abedin. And now Abedin\u2019s estranged husband (Weiner) may be spilling the beans, and getting a bit of sweet revenge in the process.

It\u2019s Bravo Sierra politics.
