What does Verizon, the country\u2019s biggest wireless company, see in an internet  ? Fortune criticized \u201cThe Problem With  . \u201d  \u2019s chief executive, John Legere, derided the deal as a \u201cslippery slope. \u201d The chief executive of Sprint, Marcelo Claure, said that when telecommunications companies try to get into the content business, \u201chistory has proven that every single one of them has failed. \u201d And there are reasons to think history might repeat itself. Yahoo will be merged with AOL, another faded star of Web 1. 0 that Verizon bought last year. These brands from yesterday are supposed to compete for the same advertising dollars that titans like Google and Facebook are devouring faster than ever. Still, there is a surprisingly ambitious, and risky, unifying theme hidden in the oddball assortment of websites and internet services that Verizon has acquired over the last year or so: The company is rethinking who its customer actually is. It is imagining a future when its most important client may not be a mother signing up for a family cellphone plan in the Verizon store. Instead, the customer will be corporations  \u2014   advertisers  \u2014   that want to reach that family, and that are willing to pay Verizon to help them do so. \u201cTheir goal is not to appeal to users in a different way,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cIt\u2019s to appeal to advertisers in a different way. \u201d It represents a profound philosophical shift for a company that traces its roots back to history\u2019s first telephone call. And whether or not it succeeds, it could have ramifications for tech, media and advertising companies around the globe. Already, it is drawing Verizon into new controversies around privacy and net neutrality. But executives prefer to emphasize other aspects of their idea. They talk up how Verizon\u2019s existing assets  \u2014   phone and data networks that knit together the nation  \u2014   might be paired with its new media properties, which include The Huffington Post and Style Me Pretty, a website \u201cfor the modern bride. \u201d Location information from wireless customers could mean better geolocated ads for smartphone users. National Football League games licensed for viewing on smartphones might be streamed on Yahoo sites as well  \u2014   all in the service of selling ads. Taken together, Yahoo, AOL and Verizon\u2019s other websites still reach more than a billion users a month, a significant number even in Silicon Valley. And Verizon is eager to change the narrative. For six and a half contentious weeks this spring, the company was ensnared in a nasty labor battle with the unions representing nearly 40, 000 workers who service its landlines. Picketers massed outside Verizon stores. Workers held a candlelight vigil at the home of Verizon\u2019s chief executive. Senator Bernie Sanders accused the company of \u201ccorporate greed. \u201d The Labor secretary finally brokered a truce. Everything about the   street fight was at odds with the kind of company Verizon has been spending billions of dollars trying to become. Yet change will come slowly for a company as big as Verizon. Valued at roughly $225 billion, Verizon is one of the 15 largest companies in the country by sales. Annual revenues exceed $130 billion and the work force is 160, 000. Verizon is now the biggest wireless company in the country, selling voice and data plans to roughly one in three Americans. That is more precarious than it might sound. While Verizon is still adding wireless customers, its sales are no longer growing. Price wars with ATT, Sprint and   have limited how much Verizon can charge. This week, the company reported a rare decline in quarterly revenues. Profits were down too, hurt by the strike. This dynamic is unlikely to change soon. If Verizon remains a traditional telecommunications company, it is likely to face years of eroding sales and slumping profits. That\u2019s why Lowell McAdam, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, is trying to buy his way into the plump and growing market for digital advertising. \u201cIt\u2019s empire retention,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. If Verizon has its way, it will cast off its reputation as a big, boring telephone company battling a unionized work force and emerge as a digital media player mentioned in the same breath as Snapchat and Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s quite the pivot. At first glance, the acquisitions have almost nothing to do with Verizon\u2019s main moneymaking activity  \u2014   selling data plans to its roughly 110 million cellphone customers. \u201cThere\u2019s not really any synergy between Verizon\u2019s core business and the AOL and Yahoo play,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. Yet even before it scooped up AOL and Yahoo, Verizon set about trying to remake itself. In recent years, Verizon has spent more than $10 billion on deals. Some have been successful. EdgeCast and UpLynk, companies that serve video content and video advertising, still have growing revenues. A decade ago Verizon launched Fios, an expensive landline cable television and internet service. In doing so, it was taking on established cable giants like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Today, Fios has gained 5. 5 million customers, and the business brings in about $10 billion a year. But other new ventures haven\u2019t panned out. CloudSwitch and Terremark, two recent acquisitions, were meant to be the foundation for Verizon\u2019s push into cloud computing, a growing industry dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. This year, Verizon pulled back on its cloud businesses, ceding ground in one of the most lucrative new industries in computing. Whether or not Yahoo and AOL can give Mr. McAdam the growth he needs isn\u2019t clear. Though the companies aren\u2019t in the same class as Facebook and Google, they wouldn\u2019t have to improve much to start making a difference at Verizon. Even if Verizon captured just 2 percent more of the global market for digital advertising, that would add more than $3 billion to the company\u2019s annual sales. \u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new,\u201d said Tim Armstrong, AOL\u2019s chief executive, who will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo. \u201cPeople act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future. \u201d Mr. Armstrong\u2019s answer to Facebook and Google is hardly a sure thing. Verizon\u2019s forays have already landed the company in hot water. This year Verizon settled with the Federal Communications Commission after the company used   \u201csupercookies\u201d  \u2014   an extremely    technology  \u2014   to track the web browsing of its wireless customers. Though some version of this practice is commonplace, Verizon made the browsing data available to other companies. As part of the settlement, Verizon agreed to notify customers about its targeting advertising programs and pay a $1. 35 million fine. The episode left privacy watchdogs wary of how Verizon would handle user data as its reach across the web grew. \u201cThere is some concern, especially given how reluctant Verizon was to own up to the issue with the supercookies,\u201d said Jeremy Gillula, senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt would be one thing if they had just owned up to it. \u201d Giving advertisers access to smartphone users\u2019 data without their knowledge could also be a problem for Verizon. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for using the consumer data they have, but they have to tread a fine line,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cEven if they get a user to opt in, it doesn\u2019t take many complaints to get hauled before the F. C. C. \u201d And in recent months, Verizon has come under fire for possible violations of net neutrality rules. In February, it emerged that Verizon had stopped charging its wireless customers for data if they were streaming video from Go90, a   site, leading to scrutiny from the tech press. \u201cThis sort of clearly favoring your own content raises all sorts of net neutrality concerns,\u201d Mr. Gillula said. Yahoo has popular franchises in sports and finance, and a   home page. AOL continues to draw users, and also serves the ads for MSN, the Microsoft portal, which still attracts visitors. Additionally, Verizon now owns the Go90 video site and AOL sites including TechCrunch, and it   Complex, a men\u2019s lifestyle website. Verizon has other plans as well. Mr. Armstrong said the goal was to amass an audience of two billion by 2020, and said the company was likely to continue buying websites. He promoted   advertising informed by the movements of Verizon\u2019s wireless subscribers, the potential for the companies to make money off the   internet of things  \u2014   where your dishwasher or doorbell is connected to the web  \u2014   augmented and virtual reality, and connected cars. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous growth opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the right industry. \u201d Advertisers, worried that Google and Facebook are effectively becoming a duopoly, might bite. \u201cWith Facebook and Google taking an estimated 78 cents of every new digital dollar spent, having a viable third option is welcome,\u201d said Joe Marchese, president of advanced ad products at Fox Networks. \u201cAdvertisers want to make it work,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interest in supporting and propping up a   No. 3. \u201d Yet for Verizon to believe it will have an easy path is \u201cwillful optimism,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. It ignores Google and Facebook\u2019s dominance of online advertising. Together the Silicon Valley rivals control nearly half of the worldwide online ad market, generating close to $80 billion in sales. In recent days both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported healthy quarterly results, suggesting that they are only growing stronger. At the least, Verizon appears to have gotten a good deal. It paid less than $9 billion for both AOL and Yahoo. That is a relatively insignificant sum for Verizon, which takes in more than that each month. And for that price, it obtained about 1. 2 billion active users that it can use to lure advertisers. What\u2019s more, AOL and Yahoo already generate about $7 billion in revenue annually. Compare that with LinkedIn, which had annual revenue of $3 billion, and was just sold to Microsoft for $26 billion. Or to Twitter, which had just over $2 billion in sales last year and is valued at about $12 billion. And even if Verizon\u2019s push into digital media doesn\u2019t transform the company, it has finally achieved what many knew was inevitable, but no one could previously achieve: the union of AOL and Yahoo. For years, AOL and Yahoo orbited each other like two dying stars. Rumors that one would buy the other were constant. But egos, activist investors and fluctuating share prices prevented the companies from going through with the union. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people with a lot of ideas about doing this over a long time,\u201d said Mr. Armstrong, the AOL chief. He added that he had been aware of discussions about such a deal for more than a decade. How the companies will be integrated remains to be seen. But most analysts expect Mr. Armstrong to run the combined operation. What that means for Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo chief executive, isn\u2019t clear. Big personalities aside, the true test will be whether AOL, Yahoo and the growing assortment of online properties Verizon is amassing can give Mr. McAdam the revenue increase he needs to please Wall Street. So far, there appears to be reason for some hope. Though Verizon doesn\u2019t regularly break out AOL\u2019s revenue, it said this week that the unit had $713 million in sales last quarter. This suggests that Verizon has managed to lift AOL revenue modestly over the last year. Doing the same for Yahoo, which was reporting steadily deteriorating revenue before the sale to Verizon, may be tougher. \u201cOn paper, the strategy makes sense,\u201d Mr. Moffett said. \u201cBut executing is incredibly hard, and whether they chose the right set of assets is an open question. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628359.5475833}
