Trump, the Republican nominee for president  \u2014   posted on Twitter on Monday night an image of a white bowl full of   Skittles. The image came with this text: \u201cIf I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That\u2019s our Syrian refugee problem. \u201d Mr. Trump, 38, the candidate\u2019s oldest child, then got an earful. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign called the post \u201cdisgusting. \u201d A stream of social media users denounced it as both flippant and fearmongering, noting the infinitesimal odds of being killed in a terrorist attack by a refugee. Even the parent company of Skittles weighed in. But Mr. Trump\u2019s comparison of men, women and children displaced by a horrific civil war to a chewy candy was hardly the first time he had been accused of poor taste. If his sister Ivanka Trump has become known for her polish and message discipline, he has distinguished himself by wading frequently into the shadowy waters of white supremacy,   incendiary language and conspiracy theories. Other political candidates and officeholders, including Hillary and Bill Clinton, have also had relatives attract unflattering attention. But rarely are those family members so central to a campaign. Donald Jr. Ivanka and Eric Trump  \u2014   the children from the elder Mr. Trump\u2019s first marriage, to Ivana Trump  \u2014   all spoke at the Republican National Convention and have been key players in their father\u2019s White House run. This month, Donald Trump Jr. invoked the Holocaust when he argued to a Philadelphia radio station that the news media gave Mrs. Clinton a pass on \u201cevery indiscrepancy. \u201d If Republicans had done what she had, he said, \u201cthey\u2019d be warming up the gas chamber right now. \u201d (He later claimed this was a reference to capital punishment.) He recently shared a Twitter post by Kevin MacDonald, a psychologist who has written about \u201cJewish influence\u201d for a website devoted to \u201cwhite identity, interests and culture\u201d and who has testified on behalf of a Holocaust denier. A few days before that, Mr. Trump shared on his Instagram account a picture showing the faces of his father, himself and several Trump supporters with Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character that has been   as a mascot by the \u201c\u201d an informal assembly of white nationalists,   conservatives and   internet provocateurs. \u201cA friend sent me this,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote of the image, adding that he was \u201chonored\u201d to have been included in it. The Trump campaign declined to make Donald Jr. available for comment, instead releasing a statement that echoed his derision of political correctness and applauded him for speaking \u201cthe truth. \u201d His allies and friends came to his defense. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by Don Jr. ,\u201d the Republican   nominee, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, said in an interview with NBC News. Todd Silverman, a friend from the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump \u201cis not  . \u201d Told about the Twitter accounts Mr. Trump had echoed and his \u201cgas chamber\u201d remark, Mr. Silverman, who is Jewish, said only, \u201cThat is not consistent with the person I know. \u201d Mr. Trump and his siblings have appeared at rallies and advised their father, who has generally eschewed traditional political consultants, on strategy. The elder Mr. Trump, a   supporter, often mentions that his sons are avid hunters. Donald Jr. and Eric invited journalists to watch them hunt pheasants in Iowa before the caucuses there, and Donald Jr. once posed holding the tail of a dead elephant and other animals killed during an African safari. The siblings have also taken out big game within their father\u2019s campaign: They pushed successfully to oust his onetime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Donald Jr. also has a big role in the family business, as an executive vice president whose portfolio includes expanding the company\u2019s real estate, retail, hotel and golf interests. He has also had a taste of reality stardom, appearing as an adviser on \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d an iteration of his father\u2019s hit show \u201cThe Apprentice. \u201d He lives with his wife and five children in New York, where he has flirted with the notion of running for mayor. \u201cI like to keep optionality,\u201d he said when asked on CNN if he would consider a run. The Trump campaign has called the scrutiny of his Twitter posts unfair. \u201cWe\u2019re truly living in remarkable times,\u201d said Jason Miller, a spokesman for the campaign. \u201cThe media\u2019s run out of things to attack Mr. Trump on, and so now they scour the social media accounts of his family looking for things to blow out of proportion. \u201d Appearing this month on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Donald Jr. was asked by George Stephanopoulos about his use of the frog picture, which Mr. Stephanopoulos called a \u201c  symbol of the white supremacist movement. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of Pepe the Frog,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI mean, bet you 90 percent of your viewers have never heard of Pepe the Frog. \u201d He added: \u201cI thought it was a frog in a wig. I thought it was funny. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s father has also employed his Twitter feed in ways many have found offensive. He has reposted messages from white supremacists\u2019 accounts, and in July he posted an image of Mrs. Clinton, a pile of cash and a   star in the shape of the Star of David. He quickly deleted the post and said it was not intended to be   but he later said it should not have been deleted. Around that time, his son was retweeting   social media users. In March, Donald Jr. appeared on a radio show where one of the interviewers had had David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader now running for the Senate in Louisiana, as a guest on his affiliated show. The interviewer, James Edwards, is the host of \u201cThe Political Cesspool,\u201d which has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as \u201cracist and  . \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s Skittles post on Monday, which drew almost 24, 000 \u201clikes\u201d by Tuesday afternoon, seemed almost tame by comparison. Its argument is one that many have made, sometimes using MMs, against accepting Syrian refugees, and it is consistent with the Trump campaign\u2019s talking point that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s more inclusive stance toward refugees threatens Americans. In a year marked by anxiety over terrorist attacks, 53 percent of respondents in an Associated Press poll in July thought the United States should allow fewer refugees to enter the country, as opposed to 11 percent who believed more should be allowed in. The Wrigley company, which makes Skittles, was careful not to take a position on the matter, though it was clearly not on board with being seen as a symbol of it. \u201cSkittles are candy,\u201d a company official said in a statement. \u201cRefugees are people. We don\u2019t feel it is an appropriate analogy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561920.5785127}
