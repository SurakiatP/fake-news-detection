But insurers and employers  \u2014   who pay the bulk of the cost for drugs  \u2014   say that a bigger financial shock has come from a largely overlooked source: expensive   medications like Humira and Enbrel, drugs taken by millions of people for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. In recent years, the prices of the medications have doubled, making them the costliest drug class in the country by some calculations. Now, one of the most powerful forces on the side of drug payers is pushing back. On Thursday, Express Scripts, the nation\u2019s largest drug benefits manager, changed its recommendations to insurers and employers, saying they should cover fewer drugs for many inflammatory conditions. The idea is that the new limits will force drug companies to lower their prices, saving insurers and employers money. The approach has already set off some complaints among patients, who rely on regular injections of the drugs to keep painful and uncomfortable symptoms in check. If an approved drug does not work, patients will have to take extra steps to get a different drug. But Express Scripts said that the move was necessary to contain costs. The drugs account for nearly 10 percent of all drug spending among its members in the United States, the company says  \u2014   costing an estimated $7. 5 billion  \u2014   even though fewer than 1 percent of its members use them. \u201cThis is a category of drugs that are used for crippling, very painful conditions, yet they don\u2019t affect huge numbers of people,\u201d said Dr. Glen Stettin, the chief innovation officer at Express Scripts. The rising costs, he said, are due less to a rising number of patients who need the products and \u201cmuch more because of the increase in the prices of these medications. \u201d The approach is the latest effort by insurers and drug benefit managers to more closely manage drugs in   diseases, limiting which ones are covered or requiring patients to take additional steps to get approval for certain products. In 2014, Express Scripts shook up the market for hepatitis C drugs when it required its patients to use a new treatment by AbbVie rather than more expensive competitors. It made similar moves last year with the approval of expensive new treatments for high cholesterol. Like those previous efforts, the effort for inflammatory conditions will most likely help the company\u2019s   specialty pharmacy, Accredo. Express Scripts said patients getting the   medications through the new program would need to use Accredo, not a competing pharmacy, giving the service a bigger base of customers. As a drug benefit manager, Express Scripts provides services like negotiating with drug companies and approving or denying drug claims. The new program is voluntary for employers and insurers who use the company, but its recommendations are usually widely adopted. Humira, made by AbbVie, and Enbrel, made by Amgen, each carry a monthly list price of just over $4, 000, and each have increased those prices by about 130 percent from 2011 to 2016, according to the Gold Standard Drug Database compiled by Elsevier Clinical Solutions. That price does not include rebates that the manufacturers negotiate with insurers. Express Scripts said that the actual monthly cost of   drugs, before the new program, was about $3, 000. Representatives for large employers, who subsidize the health insurance of their employees, said the efforts were welcome. Drugs like Humira and Enbrel are known as specialty drugs, a category of products that treat serious conditions and whose rising costs have increasingly alarmed those who are paying the bills. \u201cIf you go back to 2014, it wasn\u2019t even on the radar screen for employers, and now it\u2019s No. 1,\u201d said Brian J. Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which advocates for large employers. But some patients questioned whether it would further limit the options for some people or make it more cumbersome to get the medications they needed. The program would apply only to new patients those already stable on drugs would be allowed to remain on them. \u201cJumping through hoops may not seem like a big thing to somebody that doesn\u2019t have to live with the condition,\u201d said Nicole Martin, 33, of Blaine, Ky. who has rheumatoid arthritis and takes Enbrel. \u201cBut even being a day or two behind can cause massive issues for somebody. \u201d Traditionally, patients were offered all the drugs that were covered by their plans no matter which inflammatory condition they had  \u2014   from rheumatoid arthritis to psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. Under the new guidelines, Express Scripts has devised a separate list of preferred and nonpreferred drugs for each condition. Patients who want to use a drug on the nonpreferred list will need a letter from their doctor. The company said the move would require drug companies to compete more directly. The motivation to get on the preapproved list, the company said, would push drug companies to offer better discounts to employers and insurers. Express Scripts declined to provide specifics about the discounts that it had negotiated through the new program. \u201cWe expect to make a big dent in the cost of caring for people in this category, without compromising the care that people get,\u201d Dr. Stettin said. Dr. Stettin said the company looked at patient data first when deciding which drugs would be preferred. \u201cClinical always comes first, and the cost is second,\u201d he said. Representatives for drug companies, including AbbVie and Amgen, said they believed doctors and patients  \u2014   and not insurance companies  \u2014   should decide which therapy is best. And they said the list price does not reflect the rebates and other discounts that insurance companies and   managers negotiate, which make the actual cost lower. \u201cBecause of the magnitude of these rebates,\u201d said Kristen Davis, a spokeswoman for Amgen, \u201cprice increases have become part of the competitive dynamic. \u201d The program will also refund up to $2, 000 a month to employers and insurers if a patient has to switch from a preferred drug to a different medication in the first three months, a potential savings of about $250 million a year. About a quarter to a third of patients end up switching to a new drug in the first few months, Express Scripts said. But that   guarantee does not necessarily go to the patient, even if the patient has a   plan and paid for all or most of the drug. Employers will decide whether to pass that refund along to the patients, Express Scripts said. A reason that the rising cost of drugs like Humira and Enbrel hasn\u2019t stoked greater outrage is that many patients are shielded from the costs. In addition to the discounts the companies negotiate with drug benefit managers, AbbVie and Amgen run assistance programs that often reduce patients\u2019    costs. The average Express Scripts member paid $127 in monthly   for a drug to treat an inflammatory condition, the company said. Dr. Stettin said patients would be better served by using the company\u2019s specialty pharmacy, Accredo, which has pharmacists that specialize in inflammatory conditions. He cited company data showing that patients with those conditions were more likely to take their drugs when they used Accredo compared with other pharmacies. But some industry observers said the move was a ploy to build Accredo\u2019s   business, by essentially locking in patients whose employers opt in to the new program, then making money by filling the prescription. \u201cThey really, really want their hands on that script,\u201d said Michael Rea, the chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, which advises employers on how to reduce drug costs.'"}, "time": 1742564612.9536548}
