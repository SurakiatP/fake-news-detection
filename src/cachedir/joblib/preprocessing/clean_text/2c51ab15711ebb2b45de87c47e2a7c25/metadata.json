But newly released FBI notes strongly suggest they still exist in several locations \u2014 and they could be recovered, if only someone would impanel a grand jury and seize them. \\nIn a May interview with FBI agents, an executive with the Denver contractor that maintained Clinton\u2019s private server revealed that an underling didn\u2019t bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to Clinton\u2019s aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to Congress. \\nThe Platte River Networks executive, whose name was redacted from the interview report, said PRN tech Paul Combetta \u201ccreated a \u2018vehicle\u2019 to transfer email files from the live mailboxes of [Clinton Executive Services Corp.] email accounts [and] then later used BleachBit software to shred the \u2018vehicle,\u2019 but the email content still existed in the live email accounts.\u201d\""}, "time": 1742563305.1416583}
