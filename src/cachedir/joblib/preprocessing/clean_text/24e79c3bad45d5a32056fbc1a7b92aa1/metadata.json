His best friend from college, Mike Canfora, was getting married. Mr. Canfora flew in from Seattle, others drove in from Massachusetts and Manhattan, and some lived nearby. Eight of the 10 groomsmen were there. A   TV loudly projected the Giants N. F. L. game. Paper plates containing sandwiches, pasta, salad and steak, food that had been catered, were strewn about. Wine and beer were consumed. Then Dana Manganelli, a stylist who routinely makes house calls for Mr. Fox Suits in Montclair, N. J. arrived. The mood changed to an almost giddy quality as the eight groomsmen piled into the den, unzipped the garment bags, pulled out their custom suits and proudly showed one another their individualized linings. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked forward to this day for months,\u201d said Mr. Canfora, 27, who flew in with his fianc\u00e9e, Jenna Campana, 28, for this second and final fitting before his wedding, which was Oct. 8 at the LaPlaya Beach  Golf Resort in Naples, Fla. \u201cWomen have so many events. Other than the bachelor party, guys don\u2019t have another opportunity to get together and celebrate. \u201d The scene was a familiar one. In fact, it was an encore performance. On Aug. 5, these same men huddled around Mr. Granatell\u2019s swimming pool, drank their favorite beer, ingested a similar meal, smoked some stogies and were fitted for wedding suits by Justin Fox, who owns Mr. Fox Suits. Women aren\u2019t the only ones having fitting parties to celebrate their special day. And as the demand for these   increases, suit fitters and online rental companies are embracing this new transition by creating environments to meet clients\u2019   and individual needs. \u201cI opened my own shop last September, and my first gentlemen\u2019s fitting was in January,\u201d Mr. Fox said. Since then, he estimates he has done more than 20 events 10 have been groom gatherings. \u201cSo I developed \u2018Suits  Scotch\u2019 nights from this growing trend,\u201d Mr. Fox said. \u201cEvenings like this give men an experience. It\u2019s like a Tupperware party for guys. \u201d Lewis Malivanek, creative director of Knot Standard, a   company on West 24th Street in Manhattan, agreed. \u201cGroup groom fittings have become surprisingly popular over the past few years as custom clothing becomes more important and more affordable to the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have these parties once or twice a week. \u201d The company recently moved to a bigger space with the goal of accommodating these larger male celebrations. Some perks include drinks served by a bartender from a recently purchased antique bar,   TV, couches and lounging area. On weekends, bagels are served, and on weeknights, food is catered. \u201cMen are realizing they don\u2019t have to rent a tux or go to Brooks Brothers to buy something that\u2019s made to fit everyone,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are fitted for them and can be worn to other events. That\u2019s very appealing to them. And they\u2019re personalized. We had one recent party where everyone used their football team colors for the lining. This is them creating what they want to wear, and brides are giving them free rein, which is great for something that\u2019s mostly planned by the woman. \u201d Many brides are pleased to see their other half\u2019s fashion involvement. And it removes pickup,   and   pressures. \u201cHaving everyone get their suits handed to them took so much stress off of me,\u201d the new Ms. Canfora said. \u201cRental is only for three days. Every day it\u2019s late you\u2019re charged. Because we\u2019re a destination wedding, these guys would have had to pick it up in Florida on Thursday and drop it off on Sunday. There\u2019s 10 guys. Do you think all 10 guys are going to drop it off? No. \u201d Then there is the      factor. \u201cThey\u2019re going to forget and accidentally pack it,\u201d Ms. Canfora added. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not my responsibility, I feel responsible, and I didn\u2019t want anyone to be charged more. It\u2019s enough that they\u2019re paying to travel and stay in Florida. \u201d Bang for the buck is also a consideration. \u201cWhy rent something that doesn\u2019t really fit for $250 to $300, which you can only wear once, when you can own a custom suit for $500, which I can wear to work or another occasion?\u201d said Mr. Granatell, 31. Mr. Granatell and the others did indeed pay about $500 each for their custom suits. For some grooms, seeing themselves for the first time in their suits, standing in front of a mirror, with all of their friends watching and clapping, is the equivalent to a bride\u2019s \u201cSay Yes to the Dress\u201d moment. \u201cIt\u2019s like unveiling the wedding gown,\u201d said Kendall Michaelis, a senior stylist at Knot Standard. \u201cYou\u2019d never feel that from a rental. Rentals are not personal in any way. When they do it as a group, it\u2019s more special and real, and this is their moment. \u201d Last year, the Black Tux was a mostly online rental service in Santa Monica, Calif. In April, it opened its first showroom in Chicago. Another followed in June in Santa Monica, and one in Dallas is in the works. \u201cGroom gatherings were a   now they take place more than once a week,\u201d said Dan Wenhold, the company\u2019s director of retail sales. \u201cMillennials have a desire to have a physical connection to retail and to each other. \u201d To meet this growing demand, the company developed a strategy. It closes early for the private parties. It serves beer or whiskey and pizza. It has hired more staff members for    with clients and added dressing rooms for simultaneous fittings. Over the next several months, Mr. Wenhold plans to add pool and shuffleboard tables and other activities  \u2014   all of which will be free. Not everyone wants to host a party. Some men are accompanied by only their fathers or fianc\u00e9es. \u201cFew grooms will spend $1, 500 to $3, 000 for a tux,\u201d said Ronald Rothstein, an owner of Kleinfeld Bridal, which after three years closed its men\u2019s division last year and replaced the space with women\u2019s shoes. \u201cIf he does, he\u2019s going to Bergdorf or Saks. I can make $2, 000 for a tuxedo or $15, 000 on one bride\u2019s dress. But other than the bachelor party, this is one of the only ways for men to get the same experience women do, so I understand why this has become popular. \u201d Rentals are a      generalized measurement item, sometimes poorly fitting and shapeless. \u201cIn the past, I went on my own to the Men\u2019s Wearhouse or Joseph Bank, which are all the same,\u201d Mr. Canfora said. \u201cYou open a contract, you get fitted and you leave. You never see your tux until you pick it up. And it\u2019s all the same tux wherever you go to pick it up: New Jersey, Seattle or Florida. It\u2019s convenient. That\u2019s why people do it. But there was never a level of excitement like this. This was really bonding for all of us. \u201d Customization allows for a number of advantages. \u201cEverything is styled and created just for you,\u201d Ms. Michaelis said. Knot Standard offers six price ranges, from $795 to $3, 000, paired with 20 different measurements specific to body type. \u201cWe help you pick out fabrics, colors, linings, buttons, threading, collar and pockets. \u201d Then there\u2019s the opportunity for names, dates and personalized messages. \u201cWe can add your wedding date to the inside of your collar, or monogram your wedding invite inside the tux, or add a message to the waistband,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve even seen short messages on the inside zipper of the pants. Everyone likes these additions. \u201d In the end, however, a good consumer purchase is nothing compared to the memory it creates. After Ms. Manganelli did last looks, the men lined up outside for an iPhone photo shoot. A sense of   coolness and pride encompassed them. There were slaps on the backs,   and lit cigars. \u201cThis adds to the wedding process,\u201d Mr. Granatell said. \u201cThis suit is special. Every time I open my closet and I see the suit hanging there, I\u2019m going to think of Mike, the wedding and this experience. When I get married, I\u2019d want to do the same thing. Renting, you have you give it back, and then it\u2019s gone. I\u2019ll have this for the rest of my life. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562634.3027787}
