Glover said she decided to hang the \u201cLyin\u2019 Hillary\u201d doll to show that Clinton should be \u201cincarcerated, at the very least.\u201d \\nSo does Glover wish harm on the former Secretary of State? She insisted she didn\u2019t: \u201cIt\u2019s just for effect.\u201d \\nOne is left wondering why, if Glover thinks Clinton should be imprisoned, she didn\u2019t dress the doll in an orange jumpsuit or prison stripes. Perhaps she\u2019s simply not bright enough to have thought of doing so. \\nIn recent weeks, various disturbing and violent displays have shown up at Trump rallies: Earlier this week at a rally in Virginia Beach, Trump supporters took a model of Clinton\u2019s head and mounted it on a stake. \\nAlso, at that same rally, reporters saw a poster which depicted a bull\u2019s-eye superimposed over Clinton\u2019s face. \\nIt should also be noted that a frequent chant heard at Trump rallies is the oft-repeated \u201cLock her up\u201d refrain which was a feature of the GOP convention in Cleveland. Yet the Trump campaign always denies that their supporters are are the least bit violent or seeking confrontations with those who disagree with them. \\nActions speak louder than words, and clearly the Trumpkins are a hate-filled basket of deplorables. \\nFeatured Image Via NBC News Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
