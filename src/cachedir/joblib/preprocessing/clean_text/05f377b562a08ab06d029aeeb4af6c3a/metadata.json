The declaration, made in January 2015, put the city\u2019s   Correction Department in the vanguard of national jail reform efforts. But a year and a half later, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio is still struggling to pull it off. The city missed another deadline last week, and it is now requesting a second   extension. City officials had originally promised to end the use of the punishment for young adults by January 2016. Most of the 78 young adults who were in isolation at the beginning of the year have been moved out. But while the city has now eliminated segregation for the   to    there are some older, more difficult inmates remaining who cause such serious disciplinary problems, according to the correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, that at least for now segregation is still needed. As solitary confinement has been emptied, the violence in the jail for young adults has significantly increased, Mr. Ponte wrote in a letter to the city jail watchdog agency last week. The correction officers\u2019 union has long argued that ending the use of segregation would endanger guards and lead to greater violence. Eliminating solitary confinement is an expensive,   proposition. To replace it, the city has created enhanced supervision units, with two officers and one counselor for every 12 inmates. Not long ago, a typical cellblock was overseen by one guard for every 50 inmates. A few weeks ago, The New York Times interviewed several of the nine remaining inmates under age 22 still in isolation at the part of the jail complex known as 3 South Segregation Unit. A correction officer and a member of the commissioner\u2019s press office were present for the interviews the inmates were shackled to a wall. \u201cMy first week I was in the box. I broke a guy\u2019s jaw. He was big, too, so, you know, that boosted my ego. \u201d Since arriving at Rikers in March 2015, Mr. Delgado says he has spent about 40 days in solitary. At times, he said, life in the box could be a relief from the violence of the regular population. \u201cI was fighting the whole week,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m like, damn, finally a break. I used to wake up, and breakfast is like 4, 5 in the morning. So you got to fight for your cereal, so I\u2019m like I didn\u2019t even brush my teeth. My heart is pumping, and I got to get ready. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s about to happen but it\u2019s about to go down. I was exhausted. \u201d That feeling of safety lasted for only a few hours, he said. Other inmates yelled constantly, and he missed privileges like commissary and three daily phone calls. Mr. Delgado has been in and out of Rikers since he was 16, mostly short stints for drugs and other minor crimes. This time he is potentially facing a   sentence for the murder of a    man in Queens. \u201cI think about it  \u2014   damn this could be the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I got to have a radio or something to keep my mind off that, talk to someone. \u201d He looks forward to his girlfriend\u2019s visits. \u201cShe keeps me at peace. She reminds me of what I got in the town. \u201d Because he is constantly in trouble, he and his girlfriend are separated by a glass partition during visits. He has not kissed her since September. \u201cI forgot how her lips taste. \u201d Mr. Busgith has done several stretches in isolation during his six stays at Rikers, the longest for six months in 2014, when he was 18. He said he had no choice but to fight so he would not be seen as weak. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do time in the box, but eventually, due to the circumstances, I had to. \u201d The entire time he was being interviewed, an inmate nearby in Cell 11 screamed profanities. Mr. Busgith said he did not hear it anymore. \u201cHe do that all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s just killing time. \u201d Mr. Busgith tries to speed up time. \u201cYou take your medication so you just sleep all day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou talk with your peers, your colleagues. I\u2019ve been locked up a long time. Lot of colleagues. You\u2019ve got to be crazy to be in a cell 23 hours a day. Some people get locked up for shelter and food. I\u2019m not one of those type people. I got a life outside. \u201d He has an older brother, Michael, serving time upstate at Southport Correctional Facility, in Pine City, N. Y. a   prison where all of the inmates are held in solitary. \u201cHe in the box right now, too,\u201d Mr. Busgith said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to do a year and a half. \u201d Though Mr. Busgith has never been upstate, he says his brother has told him it is better doing time there than at Rikers. Mr. Busgith said that at upstate prisons, \u201cyou get longer visits\u201d and more recreation time. \u201cYou get to do better, you get commissaries better. Everything\u2019s better upstate. It\u2019s open, you in the open. Fresh air. You don\u2019t breathe none of this Rikers Island stuff. \u201d \u201cIf we had the same privileges as general population, I wouldn\u2019t mind staying here,\u201d Mr. Waddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet, you get to stay to yourself. You\u2019re safe. Got your own space, your own bed, your own toilet. You get to have your \u2018me\u2019 time. Get in population, you\u2019ve got to worry about different personalities and everything else that comes with jail. \u201d Mr. Waddy had been in solitary confinement for about 30 days. This is his first stint at Rikers. He has been there for two and a half years awaiting trial and spends a lot of his days reading books, \u201clike gangster stuff,\u201d and working out: \u201cFifty   then 50 situps, 50 dips, 50 jumping jacks. Relieves stress. \u201d When he looks through the small window of his cell, he says, he can just barely see a television that hangs on a support column in the center of the cellblock, though there is no sound. He said he did not care about the closing of the solitary unit. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to what\u2019s going on. \u201d Though Mr. Martinez has been in this country only three years, he is on his fourth stint at Rikers. He fled to the United States from Honduras, he said, after a group of men murdered his father. \u201cI saw when they killed him,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cI was there. \u201d To break the solitude, inmates lean against the steel cell doors  \u2014   \u201cgetting up on the gate,\u201d they call it  \u2014   and shout back and forth to one another. They yell through the vents. During their one hour outside, spent alone in a bare recreation pen, they talk through the chain link fencing. Mr. Martinez speaks only Spanish, isolating him more than most. In solitary, inmates are at the mercy of guards for their most basic needs  \u2014   meals, a shower, a sick call. They scream and bang their cell doors to get a guard\u2019s attention. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to people someone has to translate,\u201d Mr. Martinez said in Spanish. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful. Sometimes the guards shout at you. It\u2019s hard to use the phone, get things. \u201d He thinks it is good that the city is ending solitary confinement for inmates his age. \u201cIt gives people a second chance,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone gets brought here, they might not understand it. \u201d To pass time, he reads if he has a book or magazine National Geographic is a favorite. And he thinks about his case. \u201cI\u2019m facing an offer of three and a half years,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have to choose it or not. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561789.2116435}
