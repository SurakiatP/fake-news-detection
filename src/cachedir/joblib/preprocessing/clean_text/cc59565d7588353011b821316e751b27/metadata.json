Rolling Stone and its parent company Wenner Media were also found to have defamed Eramo, who is seeking $7.5 million in damages, but to a lesser extent than the writer herself. Rubin Erdely\u2019s piece conveyed that Eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser, Jackie Coakley , in addition to discouraging her from reporting the \u201ccrime.\u201d And so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade.\\nThe controversy, which began with the publication of Rubin Erdely\u2019s story in 2014, centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist Coakley . Well before this week\u2019s court decision, Rubin Erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male UVA students accused of the act. These young men, via their Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, are suing separately for $25 million , a surprisingly low figure which makes Eramo\u2019s claim look comparatively astronomical.\\nSabrina Rubin Erdely, far left, arrives for court. Pictured on the right is the Deputy Managing Editor of Rolling Stone, Sean Woods, instrumental in the bogus story\u2019s publication and who defended it later.\\nBecause of Coakley\u2019s limited financial position, and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given, Eramo is legally pursuing only Rubin Erdely, Rolling Stone , and Wenner Media for the $7.5 million. Nevertheless, Eramo\u2019s attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling. She was, after all, UVA\u2019s go-to college administrator for handling \u201csexual violence\u201d cases, a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts.\\nAside from Eramo, UVA President Teresa Sullivan\u2019s actions were appalling. Giving basic credence to Jackie\u2019s allegations, Sullivan suspended all Greek Life activities at the University of Virginia as publicity about the accusations grew. This only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members, plus gave ammunition to the \u201crape culture\u201d activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women.\\nThe true victims are the falsely accused young men, not Nicole Eramo Nicole Eramo is a \u201cvictim\u201d of the same system she helps to prop up and defend: \u201crape culture.\u201d\\nNicole Eramo may have been defamed, but she was also intricately involved in a UVA system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights. Whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting Jackie Coakley\u2019s lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement, we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual.\\nAfter extensive research, I am yet to find instances of Eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault, whether in specific instances or more broadly. She is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower. The only \u201cpositive\u201d thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical knee-jerk SJW reactions, i.e. she did try to get Jackie to talk to the police.\\nAgain, Jackie Coakley has escaped any punishment Stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer Jackie Coakley. Thanks to Chuck Johnson and www.gotnews.com for their work in outing Coakley as a fabulist and sociopath.\\nJackie Coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess. Notwithstanding that Rubin Erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in America, the degree of malice and calculation in Coakley\u2019s actions is the worst I have seen. Even the very terrible Crystal Mangum , the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide (not false rape allegations), made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically, after Duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper. Coakley\u2019s misdeeds, however, inhabit a world of their own.\\nBecause women like Jackie Coakley, obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and self-victimization, have next to no money to go after in defamation suits, they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief. It obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim, yet Coakley had enough self-preserving foresight to avoid talking to the police. Consequently, the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape. To boot, The Washington Post may have savaged Rubin Erdely and Rolling Stone , but it still refuses to publish Jackie Coakley\u2019s full name, despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations.\\nIf Nicole Eramo gets $7.5 million, the accused male UVA students deserve $7.5+ billion Attention-seeker Emily Renda. She used Jackie Coakley\u2019s lies to promote an agenda, not seek redress for a \u201cvictim.\u201d\\nDetermination of damages in the Nicole Eramo case is yet to take place and the $7.5 million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team, a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum. At a minimum, the accused UVA students deserve 100 times more than whatever Eramo gets. Of course, Wenner Media\u2019s coffers are nowhere near that big, but the principle remains. Compared to the mauled reputations of the witch-hunted fraternity members, Eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding.\\nOther villains in this saga also need to be held to account. Chief among them is Emily Renda , a sociology major at UVA who is now completing a law degree at UC Berkeley. A \u201crape culture\u201d extremist, she acted as the conduit between Coakley and Rubin Erdely. As Chuck Johnson and Got News have already demonstrated, Renda\u2019s own \u201crape survivor\u201d story has changed . Biased \u201cjournalists\u201d such as Anna Merlan , formerly of Jezebel , additionally promoted the UVA hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place. So many supporting actors created this mess.\\nLet\u2019s hope that the heavy legal blows against Rubin Erdely, Rolling Stone , and, obliquely, Jackie Coakley\u2019s lies continue with the UVA fraternity defamation suit. Only significant financial and legal hardship, not the pangs of conscience, will stop SJWs and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men.\\nRead More: Why Hasn\u2019t Jackie Coakley Been Punished For Starting The Biggest Rape Hoax Of The Decade? \\n\\n'"}, "time": 1742562395.3270938}
