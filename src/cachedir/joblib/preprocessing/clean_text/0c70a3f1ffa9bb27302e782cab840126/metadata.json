Trump hailed Mike Pence\u2019s steady debate performance as a credit to his own judgment on Wednesday in a renewed attempt to allay voters\u2019 concerns about his temperament and readiness for the presidency. Calling Mr. Pence the \u201cfirst hire\u201d of his administration, Mr. Trump said his running mate was an advertisement for government \u00e0 la Trump. He pronounced himself \u201cvery, very proud of Gov. Mike Pence. \u201d \u201cLast night, America also got to look firsthand at my judgment  \u2014   and that was judgment,\u201d Mr. Trump said in Nevada. \u201cYou know you need judgment for people, for deals. \u201d With a swift and    effort to link Mr. Pence\u2019s debate outing back to the top of the ticket, Mr. Trump and his advisers tried once again to move on from one of the worst stretches of his campaign. After a widely panned performance in his debate last week with Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump faces a steeper climb than ever as he works to persuade voters that he is fit for the presidency. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers fanned out on television Wednesday to make the most of Mr. Pence\u2019s moment Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, called the debate proof of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat judgment and leadership. \u201d It is doubtful that Mr. Pence\u2019s performance in his debate with Senator Tim Kaine, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, will do much to move voters toward Mr. Trump. Mr. Kaine mounted an insistent and prodding attack on Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence at the   debate, frequently interrupting Mr. Pence to demand that he defend Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive statements. Mr. Pence remained unruffled as he sidestepped those demands, but on Wednesday he faced intense scrutiny  \u2014   and a battery of attacks from Democrats  \u2014   for evading questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s record. Yet with Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament and readiness for the presidency lingering as central concerns for voters, the hope among Trump allies is that Mr. Pence may have essentially reassured Americans, by proxy, that Mr. Trump is calm enough for the job. Democrats dismissed that possibility on Wednesday morning. And they assailed Mr. Pence for having misrepresented the positioning and past comments of his running mate the Clinton campaign released a video showing Mr. Pence\u2019s denials alongside clips of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. The video concludes with a dig at both men: \u201cIt\u2019s O. K. Mike. We\u2019d have a hard time defending him, too. \u201d Rallying supporters at a Philadelphia union hall on Wednesday evening, Mr. Kaine kept swinging at Mr. Trump and his running mate. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty smooth,\u201d Mr. Kaine said of Mr. Pence. \u201cBut there is one thing he can\u2019t do, and that is defend Donald Trump on anything  \u2014   on anything. \u201d Mr. Kaine allowed that he had been \u201cdinged a little bit, even by my wife, for, like, interrupting too much. \u201d But Democrats said Mr. Kaine had successfully trained his fire on Mr. Trump and exposed Mr. Pence as incapable of defending his running mate on the merits. On the stump in Ohio, Bill Clinton described Mr. Pence as having tried to \u201cshimmy out of a discussion\u201d on basic economic issues like the minimum wage and equal pay for women. And at a   event in Washington, Mrs. Clinton poked fun at Mr. Pence for having \u201cbobbed and weaved\u201d his way through the debate. \u201cPence refused to defend the statements because they are indefensible,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when your own running mate won\u2019t defend the top of the ticket, I think that tells you everything you need to know. \u201d Mr. Pence repeatedly disputed quotations from Mr. Trump that were, in fact, accurate: He claimed in one instance that Mr. Trump had not indicated he might allow more nations to acquire nuclear weapons, though Mr. Trump had done just that. At one point, Mr. Pence appeared to break openly with Mr. Trump in his views about Russia, calling Mr. Putin a \u201csmall and bullying leader,\u201d though Mr. Trump had consistently said the opposite. Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign treated the aftermath of the debate as a kind of respite from a turbulent week and a half during which Mr. Trump made a series of intemperate attacks on subjects including a former Miss Universe\u2019s physique and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s marriage. Mr. Pence took something of a victory lap at a campaign stop in Harrisonburg, Va. where Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, introduced him as \u201cone heck of a debater. \u201d Mr. Pence said Mr. Trump had called to congratulate him, and declared the night a victory for the top of the ticket. \u201cFrom where I sat, Donald Trump won the debate,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s vision to make America great again won the debate. \u201d He repeated his accusation from the debate that Mr. Kaine and Mrs. Clinton have been throwing \u201can avalanche of insults\u201d in the campaign. There is scant polling information on how most voters reacted to the debate, and it is unclear that an encounter between comparatively   running mates might reshape a race dominated by two outsize presidential candidates. And any lingering fallout from the candidates\u2019 performances will almost certainly be swallowed up by a debate between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton on Sunday  \u2014   a far more consequential event, and one much likelier to shift voter attitudes. Ms. Conway, the Trump campaign manager, expressed confidence Wednesday morning that he would offer a \u201cpowerful performance\u201d in the second presidential debate, a town   discussion at Washington University in St. Louis. She likened the format to Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, though he rarely takes questions from members of his audience or engages in traditional retail politics. Mr. Trump is seen as needing a drastic recovery in Sunday\u2019s debate after a dismal performance against Mrs. Clinton on Sept. 26. He has slipped markedly in the polls over the past week and appears to have sacrificed much of the ground he captured in September. A Monmouth University poll released on Wednesday showed Mrs. Clinton with a   edge over Mr. Trump in Ohio, where he had been running strong Monmouth surveys this week have also shown Mrs. Clinton leading by double digits in Colorado and Pennsylvania. Visiting a barbecue restaurant in Harrisonburg, Mr. Pence told an antsy supporter of the Republican ticket that Mr. Trump would be well prepared for his next confrontation with Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get Trump to hammer Sunday night,\u201d the woman told Mr. Pence. \u201cHe\u2019s got to bring it all out. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll be ready,\u201d Mr. Pence reassured her. \u201cHe\u2019ll be ready. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564399.2394595}
