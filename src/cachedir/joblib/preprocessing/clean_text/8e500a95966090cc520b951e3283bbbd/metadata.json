S. stayed in it would have been on the hook for a fair chunk of this   pay demand from India.   Yes, you read that right. Not billion but trillion. That\u2019s $2, 500, 000, 000, 000 which India was expecting to be paid over the next 15 years by the Western nations  \u2014   ie mainly the U. S.  \u2014   as a bribe for pretending to decarbonize its economy in line with the U. N. Paris agreement. And, inevitably, it wasn\u2019t just India that wanted its climate Danegeld. So did every other country which could qualify for developing world status. Here, courtesy of Chris Horner, is a document from U. S. climate negotiator Todd Stern. He clearly thinks it\u2019s funny, though I\u2019m not sure I would if I were a taxpayer having to fund it  \u2026     In other words, Paris was never really about climate. It was a   scheme in which rich nations were expected to shower poor nations with free money. Totally about UN socialist wealth redistribution. #IPCC pic. twitter.   \u2014   Brad Rush (@OtagoGrad) June 7, 2017,  This, of course, is the real reason for the widespread global outrage at Trump\u2019s climate decision. The pigs have had their enormous trough  \u2014   stamped \u201c$$$$ courtesy of Uncle Sam\u201d  \u2014   pulled from beneath their snouts and their instinctive response is to go \u201cSooooooeeeeee! Soooooeeeeee!\u201d My two favorite deranged responses so far. This one from The Nation explaining that Trump is Hitler because he sorta, kinda used a phrase vaguely like Hitler once did in one of his speeches.  On September 30, 1942, shortly after the death camps began gassing Jews, Hitler declared, \u201cIn Germany too the Jews once laughed at my prophecies. I don\u2019t know whether they are still laughing, or whether they have already lost the inclination to laugh, but I can assure you that everywhere they will stop laughing. With these prophecies I shall prove to be right. \u201d On June 1, 2017, Donald Trump announced that he was pulling America out of the Paris climate accord. \u201cAt what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don\u2019t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won\u2019t be. They won\u2019t be. \u201d See the similarity? Me neither. Presumably that\u2019s why author Sasha Abramsky has to editorialize desperately: \u201cIt\u2019s not a direct quote from Hitler, but it\u2019s perilously close. \u201d But I forget. When you\u2019re a liberal, everyone who disagrees with you is Hitler. So I suppose to   this article is only stating the obvious. Even better though, I think, is the announcement by the United Nations that it intends to reject Trump\u2019s offer to renegotiate Paris. Here is the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) spelling it out: #ParisAgreement, a historic treaty signed by 194  ratified by 147 countries, cannot be renegotiated based on the request of a single Party. https:  .   \u2014   Patricia Espinosa C. (@PEspinosaC) June 2, 2017,  Why is this so funny? Well it\u2019s a bit like the Camp Commandant at Colditz Castle announcing sternly to the prisoners who have daringly escaped that under no circumstances will they ever be allowed inside the wire and back to their lumpy beds and freezing cells. President Trump has just made what successful escaping prisoners in World War II used to call a Home Run. I doubt he has many regrets about the camp guards he has left behind.
