Nearly   of New Jersey voters, and half his fellow Republicans, said in a recent poll that he should have been a defendant in the trial over the George Washington Bridge lane closings, in which two of his former aides were convicted last month. And in a stinging turnabout, Bill Stepien, the campaign manager whom Mr. Christie dismissed in the   Bridgegate scandal, is expected to become Donald J. Trump\u2019s White House political director, while Mr. Christie was fired as transition chief and shut out of jobs in Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, despite having been one of his earliest   supporters. Welcome home, Governor. \u201cGovernor Christie has been abandoned by virtually everyone,\u201d Krista Jenkins, director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll, said when the findings showing his approval rating at 18 percent were released this month. Once considered the Republican Party\u2019s best hope to win the White House, Mr. Christie has endured months of humiliation after he dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Mr. Trump  \u2014   who mocked him as they campaigned together for eating too many Oreos, and passed him over as the   nominee. Now, Mr. Christie has returned to New Jersey a lame duck in his last year to discover voters angry over his absences and a Legislature suddenly unwilling to go along with his agenda. \u201cIf he was at one time a bipartisan figure who was able to unite both sides of the aisle and even draw union support, that\u2019s completely evaporated,\u201d Ms. Jenkins said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find anyone in recent memory who is in such disfavor. \u2019\u2019 Mr. Christie still believes he has a political future nationally. He wants to write a book and his friends have been telling people in New Jersey that the governor expects Mr. Trump to eventually come around to him. According to their scenario, the White House management team of Jared Kushner, Stephen K. Bannon and Reince Priebus will be a disaster and Mr. Christie will be tapped as the skilled manager, like David Gergen, the former aide to Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan who swooped in to steady Bill Clinton\u2019s administration after a raucous first year. Mr. Christie\u2019s popularity in his home state, stratospheric after his handling of Hurricane Sandy, began to fall with Bridgegate, but sank even lower as he spent so much time out of the state, first leading the Republican Governors Association, then running for president. By the time he abandoned his own run and endorsed Mr. Trump, his constituents had come to believe he would do just about anything to escape New Jersey. He has left them with 10 credit downgrades, more than any other governor nationwide. And as if the state\u2019s finances were not bad enough, Mr. Christie has spent at least $10 million of taxpayer money to defend himself in the bridge scandal, and most New Jersey voters say they do not believe he has told the truth about his involvement. His waning popularity now means waning power, as he discovered last week in a surprise legislative defeat. The governor and the Democratic leaders of the State Legislature were rushing through a hastily written bill that would have relaxed ethics laws to allow Mr. Christie to profit from sales of a book and given raises to hundreds of public officials. And, in what the governor\u2019s critics called his \u201crevenge bill,\u201d the same package of legislation would have eliminated a requirement that local governments pay to publish legal notices in newspapers  \u2014   punishing an industry that relentlessly chronicled the bridge scandal. It was the kind of deal that would have breezed through even a year ago, when Mr. Christie wielded so much control that Republicans reversed their own votes to block overrides of his vetoes. This time, his own lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, who, along with her husband, a judge, was in line for a raise, called the legislation \u201cridiculous. \u201d On Twitter, #ChristieBookTitles trended, with suggestions including \u201cA Bridge to Nowhere,\u201d \u201cThe Very Hungry Governor\u201d and \u201cOh, the Places You Won\u2019t Go!\u201d With the public flooding their offices with angry phone calls, Republicans who have stood by Mr. Christie began running away from him. \u201cThat\u2019s not my bill,\u201d said Jon M. Bramnick, the Republican leader of the State Assembly and one of the governor\u2019s most steadfast supporters. And Democratic leaders, who had helped Mr. Christie secure victories on public employee benefits that made him a national figure in his first term, reversed themselves and yanked the bills without putting them up for a vote. \u201cHe thought he could do what he\u2019s done in the past  \u2014   get Democratic leadership on his side and use that to push through whatever he wanted,\u201d Jeff Tittel, the director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club and a frequent Christie critic, said, calling it \u201cthe biggest blunder since he\u2019s been governor. \u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen as much public outrage since Florio wanted to tax toilet paper,\u201d Mr. Tittel said, referring to former New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio\u2019s imposition of a tax on paper products in 1990. (Mr. Florio, a Democrat, and Mr. Christie are now tied for the   job approval, at 18 percent Gov. Brendan Byrne, another Democrat, hit 17 percent, the record low for New Jersey governors, in 1977, but was  . Now, at 92, he is generally beloved.) State Senator Jennifer Beck, a Republican, said that after Mr. Christie\u2019s absences there was \u201can expectation that now that he\u2019s back, he\u2019s going to grapple with the major issues in this state. \u201d Those would include high property taxes, the nation\u2019s highest foreclosure rate and its most underfunded pension system. When he and the Democratic leaders rushed to pass measures for raises  \u2014   estimated at $10 million a year  \u2014   and to allow him to profit from writing a book, they showed they were out of touch with the public, she said, \u201ckind of like having a tin ear. \u201d Ms. Beck said she expected that the governor\u2019s unpopularity would mean more Republicans distancing themselves from him. \u201cWhen the citizenry are behind you, it\u2019s much harder to challenge,\u201d Ms. Beck said. \u201cWhen the people aren\u2019t with you, it\u2019s easier. \u201d Mr. Christie said in a speech last month that he intended to leave the same way he came in: \u201cloudly. \u201d And on his monthly   radio show last week, he blamed \u201cthe haters,\u201d who made it \u201cpersonal, about me,\u201d for the legislative defeat. \u201cThat\u2019s O. K. that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get to do what they want to do. \u201d He insisted he would continue pushing the bill involving the newspapers, though his remarks suggested he was counting down his time. \u201cI have 391 days,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m not going to get off this issue. \u201d His office declined to comment on what else the governor might focus on during his last year in office, saying he would reveal his plans in his State of the State speech next month. In recent weeks, most of Mr. Christie\u2019s public events have been around the issue of recovery from drug addiction, which he has long spoken about as a personal cause following the death of a close friend. He has also announced plans to renovate the State House, which again raised eyebrows, given that it is expected to cost $300 million at a time when the state has severe debt. Renovations would also force Mr. Christie\u2019s successor, widely expected to be a Democrat, into rented office space rather than the official quarters for at least four years. Mr. Christie has not taken questions from reporters in more than 100 days. He has spent several mornings guest hosting a New York sports radio show, prompting speculation that he is auditioning for a more permanent role should the Trump administration not come knocking. And even his supporters said it would be hard for Mr. Christie to get much accomplished. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the last year of a second term, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Mr. Bramnick, the Republican Assembly leader, said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s looking to the future. \u201d Is the governor\u2019s approval rating as low as it can go? Not quite, said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, citing President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France. \u201cHis approval rating is at 4 percent,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Murray said. \u201cSo that gives Christie something to shoot for. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563112.6987257}
