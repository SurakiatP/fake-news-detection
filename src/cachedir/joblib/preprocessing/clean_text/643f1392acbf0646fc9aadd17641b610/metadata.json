Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, the German interior minister, said the government had banned the True Religion organization, which is also known as Read (as in the instruction to read the Quran) because it acted as a \u201ccollecting pool\u201d for   Islamist fighters. Starting on Tuesday morning, officers raided 190 premises in more than half of Germany\u2019s 16 states. Materials were secured, but there were no detentions, Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said. \u201cThe organization brings Islamic jihadists together under the pretext of the harmless distribution of the Quran,\u201d Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re told reporters in Berlin, stressing that the authorities were acting against the group because of its work to foster violence, not because of its faith. \u201cA systematic curtailment of our rule of law has nothing to do with the alleged freedom of religion,\u201d he said. The move comes after months of surveillance of the organization, whose   members have become a common sight in pedestrian shopping areas in major German cities. Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said that 140 of the group\u2019s supporters are known to have traveled to Syria or Iraq to fight on behalf of the Islamic State. \u201cThe translations of the Quran are being distributed along with messages of hatred and unconstitutional ideologies,\u201d Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said. \u201cTeenagers are being radicalized with conspiracy theories. \u201d The move comes a week after the authorities arrested five men who were accused of aiding the Islamic State in Germany by recruiting members and providing financial and logistical help. The True Religion is the sixth Islamist organization to be banned in Germany since 2012, under an effort to ensure domestic security and to prevent radicalized young people from leaving the country to fight for extremists abroad. Germany has been gripped by a wave of   terrorist attacks this year, including three that were claimed by the Islamic State: the knifing of a policeman in February, an ax attack by a young refugee, and a suicide bombing, both in July. (The only deaths in those assaults were those of the attackers.) Most of the nearly one million migrants and refugees who arrived in Germany last year were Muslims. Security officials have been concerned that those who become frustrated or disillusioned at the difficulty of starting a new life in Europe could provide fertile ground for radical Islamists seeking to recruit members. The campaign to hand out the Qurans to   was the idea of Ibrahim   a Palestinian who preaches a conservative brand of Islam known as Salafism. German security officials said he was not in Germany at the time of the raids. Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re declined to comment on Mr.  \u2019s possible whereabouts. Mr.   who has lived in Germany for more than 30 years, has been on the radar of German security officials since 2005, when he set up a website that officials say spreads extremist propaganda. An attempt to prosecute Mr.   in 2012 on charges of incitement of religious hatred failed. Even as they are carrying out a sweeping effort to prevent radical Muslims from committing terrorist acts, the German authorities are also working to stop violence by   extremists. There was a 42 percent increase in the number of violent acts committed by the far right in 2015, according to the country\u2019s domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. On Tuesday, federal prosecutors said they had charged eight men from the eastern state of Saxony with forming a   terrorist organization known as the Freital Group, after the city near Dresden where many of the group\u2019s attacks were carried out. The charges were brought by the state court in Dresden last Wednesday, the prosecutors said. \u201cThe aim of the organization was to carry out explosive attacks on shelters for asylum seekers, as well as homes, offices and automobiles of political dissidents,\u201d the prosecutors said in a statement. \u201cThrough these actions, the suspects wanted to create an atmosphere of fear and repression. \u201d Others from the group are already facing charges, including attempted murder, carrying out an explosion and vandalism, over a series of attacks that began in late July 2015 and continued through November of that year. Those assaults involved lobbing explosives at the offices of the Left Party and at a refugee shelter in Freital.'"}, "time": 1742628480.5993109}
