[Phil Wolgin, who is an immigration booster at the Center for American Progress, admitted that Trump campaigned for his new reform of border defenses.  Newsflash: Trump meant exactly what he promised on #immigration. It\u2019s as bad as expected, if not far, far worse.  \u2014   Philip Wolgin (@pwolgin) January 25, 2017,  Trump\u2019s push against illegal and legal immigration is a huge threat to the Democrats\u2019 political strategy, which assumes that a growing number of immigrants will provide needed votes to the Democrats\u2019 unruly coalition of gays and industrial workers, Muslims and Jews, Wall Street financiers and government workers, blacks and Latinos, upper income professionals and   service workers. From Janet Murgu\u00eda, the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, the largest national Latino advocacy organization in the United States.

There is no fine print on the Statue of Liberty. America must remain open to people of all faiths  backgrounds. #RefugeesWelcome pic. twitter.   \u2014   Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) January 25, 2017,  In fact, as President Trump recognized in his inauguration, the statue was designed a symbolic beacon to the developing world to how the United States manages its constitutional Republic. \u201cWe do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow,\u201d he declared.  The \u201chuddled masses\u201d poem was attached to the statue decades later to advocate for additional immigration. A spokesman for the   Council of   Relations complained about how Trump\u2019s policies might restrict legal immigration. The accompanying video from Jordan suggests that many Arabs believe they have a right to import themselves, their culture and their Islamic politics into Americans\u2019 democratic civic society.

The record highlighted by critics also shows that CAIR was named an unindicted   in a   criminal effort to deliver $12 million to the   HAMAS jihad group, that it was founded with $490, 000 from HAMAS, and that the FBI bans   meetings with CAIR officials. In 2009, a federal judge concluded that \u201cthe government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of CAIR  \u2026     with Hamas. \u201d CAIR\u2019s   pitch is being aided by the   Code Pink group of   feminists.

Bob Menendez complained about Trump\u2019s policies, even though he played a critical role in Trump\u2019s election by pushing the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d   bill in 2013. That bill split the GOP and pushed GOP base voters to support any   immigration reformer in the 2016 campaign. Trump won largely because he was the only candidate who supported the goal of   immigration reform. Pres.
