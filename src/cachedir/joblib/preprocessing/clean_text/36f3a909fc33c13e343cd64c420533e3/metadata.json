And you also may have created trouble for fellow imperiled incumbents who will now also likely be asked whether they think Donald J. Trump sets a nice example. Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, found herself in that thicket Tuesday as she continued to try to walk back the word she uttered in a debate when asked if she saw Mr. Trump as an exemplar for youth: \u201cabsolutely. \u201d Ms. Ayotte and her Democratic opponent, Gov. Maggie Hassan, are locked in one of the nation\u2019s closest Senate races, a contest that could determine whether Republicans retain   control of Capitol Hill. Like Ms. Ayotte, many Republican senators have struggled to reconcile their fortunes with those of Mr. Trump. \u201cWelcome to the 2016 election, where most party loyalists on both sides feel they need to say publicly that their candidate is a good role model but privately don\u2019t really believe it themselves,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a Republican strategist. \u201cWhat we see in New Hampshire this week is the same tortured Kabuki dance many Americans are undergoing this election season, just on a   stage. \u201d Almost instantly after the debate Monday night, Ms. Ayotte\u2019s campaign released an unusual statement saying: \u201cI misspoke tonight. While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn\u2019t hold up either of them as role models for my kids. \u201d Ms. Ayotte reiterated her comments while campaigning Tuesday morning. But in the world of digital advertising, the leavings made for good political breakfast. Ms. Hassan\u2019s campaign quickly delivered a digital ad that captured the \u201cabsolutely\u201d comment while trimming the portion of Ms. Ayotte\u2019s response that emphasized Mr. Trump was among many people who could be considered role models. (It also removed Ms. Ayotte\u2019s several \u201cums\u201d as Ms. Hassan looked on with barely concealed amusement.) Ms. Ayotte has ample company in trying to fashion a response about how to regard Mr. Trump. One colleague, Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, has gone the   route, openly scorning Mr. Trump. Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina has gone a different way, backing Mr. Trump in theory but expressing surprise at some of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks and requesting that he say them no more. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has been the target of remarks by Mr. Trump, represents the grit teeth and glare caucus, more or less refusing to answer questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s statements. He would likely pass on the role model thing, too. Ms. Ayotte has tried hard to avoid criticizing Mr. Trump  \u2014   and by proxy his voters  \u2014   saying several times that she \u201csupports\u201d him, but won\u2019t go as far as to endorse him. In an election cycle with at least half a dozen close races, both sides are trying to pounce on any perceived mistakes in the waning weeks of the campaign. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee rushed Tuesday to do its own digital ad, as did Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun safety advocacy group, which made a spot highlighting the senator\u2019s comments and juxtaposing them with footage of Mr. Trump\u2019s most incendiary comments on guns. \u201cRepublican senators and candidates will continue to get asked uncomfortable questions about Donald Trump for a very simple reason,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the committee. \u201cThey continue to support him even when he is pulling his most sexist, racist, unconscionable stunts, and their loyalty to party over common sense is quickly becoming a judgment question that is taking center stage in their races. \u201d Bob Salera, a spokesman for the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, gets an A for effort on table turning. \u201cTo be honest, we ruled out asking House Democrats if Hillary Clinton is honest because the answer seemed too obvious,\u201d he said in a statement, referring to Ms. Hassan\u2019s flub this spring when she was asked if Mrs. Clinton was honest and declined to answer the question directly. \u201cBut Maggie Hassan has proved that there is no question too simple for congressional Democrats and Democrat challengers desperately trying to walk the line between Hillary Clinton supporters and the voters who are repelled by her. \u201d Some prominent supporters of Mrs. Clinton got in on the game. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who generally does not answer questions from reporters, conveyed her thoughts via Twitter: \u201cThink about it: @realDonaldTrump calls Latinos rapists, African Americans thugs,  women fat pigs,  Kelly Ayotte thinks he\u2019s a role model. \u201d Whether the role model remark adds up to more than two days of Twitter twaddle for Ms. Ayotte is a matter of mystery. \u201cShe\u2019s done as good a job as one could separating herself from Trump for over a year,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cShe\u2019s never appeared with him, not even during the primary season. She has condemned his most extreme remarks many times. \u201cI don\u2019t think voters are under any misimpression that she supports him or is glad he is the nominee. She didn\u2019t answer the question artfully,\u201d he added, \u201cand the Democrats are trying to make it into a big deal, but I doubt it will stick. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563645.350446}
