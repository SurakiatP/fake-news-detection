{"duration": 2.397214889526367, "input_args": {"text": "'Hillary Clinton sat in the hideaway study off her ceremonial office in the State Department, sipping tea and taking stock of her first year on the job. The study was more like a den  \u2014   cozy and   lined with bookshelves that displayed mementos from Clinton\u2019s three decades in the public eye: a statue of her heroine, Eleanor Roosevelt a baseball signed by the Chicago Cubs star Ernie Banks a carved wooden figure of a pregnant African woman. The intimate setting lent itself to a   interview than the usual locale, her imposing outer office, with its marble fireplace, heavy drapes, crystal chandelier and ornate wall sconces. On the morning of Feb. 26, 2010, however, Clinton was talking about something more sensitive than mere foreign affairs: her relationship with Barack Obama. To say she chose her words carefully doesn\u2019t do justice to the delicacy of the exercise. She was like a   technician, deciding which color wire to snip without blowing up her relationship with the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed, I think, a very good rapport, really positive    about everything you can imagine,\u201d Clinton said about the man she described during the 2008 campaign as na\u00efve, irresponsible and hopelessly unprepared to be president. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had some interesting and even unusual experiences along the way. \u201d She leaned forward as she spoke, gesturing with her hands and laughing easily. In talking with reporters, Clinton displays more warmth than Obama does, though there\u2019s less of an expectation that she might say something revealing. Clinton singled out, as she often would, the United Nations   meeting in Copenhagen the previous December, where she and Obama worked together to save the meeting from collapse. She brought up the Middle East peace proc ess, a signature project of the president\u2019s, which she had been tasked with reviving. But she was understandably wary of talking about areas in which she and Obama split  \u2014   namely, on bedrock issues of war and peace, where Clinton\u2019s more activist philosophy had already collided in unpredictable ways with her boss\u2019s instincts toward restraint. She had backed Gen. Stanley McChrystal\u2019s recommendation to send 40, 000 more troops to Afghanistan, before endorsing a fallback proposal of 30, 000 (Obama went along with that, though he stipulated that the soldiers would begin to pull out again in July 2011, which she viewed as problematic). She supported the Pentagon\u2019s plan to leave behind a residual force of 10, 000 to 20, 000 American troops in Iraq (Obama balked at this, largely because of his inability to win legal protections from the Iraqis, a failure that was to haunt him when the Islamic State overran much of the country). And she pressed for the United States to funnel arms to the rebels in Syria\u2019s civil war (an idea Obama initially rebuffed before later, halfheartedly, coming around to it). That fundamental tension between Clinton and the president would continue to be a defining feature of her   tenure as secretary of state. In the administration\u2019s first   meeting on Russia in February 2009, aides to Obama proposed that the United States make some symbolic concessions to Russia as a gesture of its good will in resetting the relationship. Clinton, the last to speak, brusquely rejected the idea, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not giving up anything for nothing. \u201d Her hardheadedness made an impression on Robert Gates, the defense secretary and George W. Bush holdover who was wary of a changed Russia. He decided there and then that she was someone he could do business with. \u201cI thought, This is a tough lady,\u201d he told me. A few months after my interview in her office, another split emerged when Obama picked up a secure phone for a weekend conference call with Clinton, Gates and a handful of other advisers. It was July 2010, four months after the North Korean military torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette, sinking it and killing 46 sailors. Now, after weeks of fierce debate between the Pentagon and the State Department, the United States was gearing up to respond to this brazen provocation. The tentative plan  \u2014   developed by Clinton\u2019s deputy at State, James Steinberg  \u2014   was to dispatch the aircraft carrier George Washington into coastal waters to the east of North Korea as an unusual show of force. But Adm. Robert Willard, then the Pacific commander, wanted to send the carrier on a more aggressive course, into the Yellow Sea, between North Korea and China. The Chinese foreign ministry had warned the United States against the move, which for Willard was all the more reason to press forward. He pushed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, who in turn pushed his boss, the defense secretary, to reroute the George Washington. Gates agreed, but he needed the commander in chief to sign off on a decision that could have political as well as military repercussions. Gates laid out the case for diverting the George Washington to the Yellow Sea: that the United States should not look as if it was yielding to China. Clinton strongly seconded it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to run it up the gut!\u201d she had said to her aides a few days earlier. (The Vince Lombardi imitation drew giggles from her staff, who, even 18 months into her tenure, still marveled at her pugnacity.) Obama, though, was not persuaded. The George Washington was already underway changing its course was not a decision to make on the fly. \u201cI don\u2019t call audibles with aircraft carriers,\u201d he said  \u2014   unwittingly   Clinton on her football metaphor. It wasn\u2019t the last debate in which she would side with Gates. The two quickly discovered that they shared a Midwestern upbringing, a taste for a stiff drink after a long day of work and a   skepticism about the intentions of America\u2019s foes. Bruce Riedel, a former intelligence analyst who conducted Obama\u2019s initial review on the Afghanistan war, says: \u201cI think one of the surprises for Gates and the military was, here they come in expecting a very    administration, and they discover that they have a secretary of state who\u2019s a little bit right of them on these issues  \u2014   a little more eager than they are, to a certain extent. Particularly on Afghanistan, where I think Gates knew more had to be done, knew more troops needed to be sent in, but had a lot of doubts about whether it would work. \u201d As Hillary Clinton makes another run for president, it can be tempting to view her   rhetoric about the world less as deeply felt core principle than as calculated political maneuver. But Clinton\u2019s   instincts are bred in the bone  \u2014   grounded in cold realism about human nature and what one aide calls \u201ca textbook view of American exceptionalism. \u201d It set her apart from her    Barack Obama, who avoided military entanglements and tried to reconcile Americans to a world in which the United States was no longer the undisputed hegemon. And it will likely set her apart from the Republican candidate she meets in the general election. For all their bluster about bombing the Islamic State into oblivion, neither Donald J. Trump nor Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has demonstrated anywhere near the appetite for military engagement abroad that Clinton has. \u201cHillary is very much a member of the traditional American   establishment,\u201d says Vali Nasr, a   strategist who advised her on Pakistan and Afghanistan at the State Department. \u201cShe believes, like presidents going back to the Reagan or Kennedy years, in the importance of the military  \u2014   in solving terrorism, in asserting American influence. The shift with Obama is that he went from reliance on the military to the intelligence agencies. Their position was, \u2018All you need to deal with terrorism is N. S. A. and C. I. A. drones and special ops.\u2019 So the C. I. A. gave Obama an angle, if you will, to be simultaneously hawkish and shun using the military. \u201d Unlike other recent presidents  \u2014   Obama, George W. Bush or her husband, Bill Clinton  \u2014   Hillary Clinton would assume the office with a long record on national security. There are many ways to examine that record, but one of the most revealing is to explore her   cultivation of the military  \u2014   not just civilian leaders like Gates, but also its   commanders, the men with the medals. Her affinity for the armed forces is rooted in a lifelong belief that the calculated use of military power is vital to defending national interests, that American intervention does more good than harm and that the writ of the United States properly reaches, as Bush once put it, into \u201cany dark corner of the world. \u201d Unexpectedly, in the bombastic,   presidential election of 2016, Hillary Clinton is the last true hawk left in the race. For those who know Clinton\u2019s biography, her embrace of the military should come as no surprise. She grew up in the buoyant aftermath of World War II, the daughter of a Navy petty officer who trained young sailors before they shipped out to the Pacific. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was a staunch Republican and an anticommunist, and she channeled his views. She talks often about her girlhood dream of becoming an astronaut, citing the rejection letter she got from NASA as the first time she encountered gender discrimination. Her real motive for volunteering, she has written, may have been because her father fretted that \u201cAmerica was lagging behind Russia. \u201d Political conversion came later, after Vietnam and the \u201960s swept over Wellesley College, where she spoke out against the establishment at her graduation. But even in the tumultuous year of 1968, she was still making her transition from Republican to Democrat, managing to go to the conventions of both parties. As a Republican intern in Washington that summer, she questioned a Wisconsin congressman, Melvin Laird, about the wisdom of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s escalating involvement in Southeast Asia. It was after law school that she had her most curious encounter with the military. In 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton, she stopped in at a Marine recruiting office in Arkansas to inquire about joining the active forces or reserves. She was a lawyer, she explained maybe there was some way she could serve. The recruiter, she recalled two decades later, was a young man of about 21, in prime physical condition. Clinton was then 27, freshly transplanted from Washington, teaching law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and wearing   eyeglasses. \u201cYou\u2019re too old, you can\u2019t see and you\u2019re a woman,\u201d he told her. \u201cMaybe the dogs will take you,\u201d he added, in what she said was a pejorative reference to the Army. \u201cIt was not a very encouraging conversation,\u201d Clinton said at a lunch for military women on Capitol Hill in 1994. \u201cI decided, Maybe I\u2019ll look for another way to serve my country. \u201d Some reporters have cast doubt on the veracity of this story, which she repeated in the fall of 2015 over breakfast with voters in New Hampshire: certainly, there\u2019s no concrete evidence that it happened, and Bill gave a different account of it in 2008, substituting the Army for the Marines. Why would a professionally minded Yale Law graduate, on the cusp of marriage, suddenly want to put on a uniform? It\u2019s impossible to decipher her possible motives, but Ann Henry, an old friend who taught at the university after Clinton moved to Little Rock, offers a theory: During those days, she recalls, female faculty members, as an exercise, would test the boundaries of careers that appeared closed to women. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s made up,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was consistent with something she would have done. \u201d Clinton\u2019s next sustained exposure to the military did not come until she was first lady, almost two decades later. Living in the White House is, in many ways, like living in a military compound. A Marine stands guard in front of the West Wing when the president is in the Oval Office. The Mili tary Office operates the medical center and the telecommunications system. The Navy runs the cafeteria, the Marines transport the president by helicopter, the Air Force by plane. Camp David is a naval facility. The daily contact with men and women in uniform, Clinton\u2019s friends say, deepened her feelings for them. In March 1996, the first lady visited American troops stationed in Bosnia. The trip became notorious years later when she claimed, during the 2008 campaign, to have dodged sniper fire after her   military plane landed at an American base in Tuzla. (Chris Hill, a diplomat who was onboard that day and later served as ambassador to Iraq under Clinton, didn\u2019t remember snipers at all, and indeed recalled children handing her bouquets of spring flowers.) But there was no faking the good vibes during her tour of the mess and rec halls. With her teenage daughter at her side, she bantered and joked with the young servicemen and women  \u2014   an experience, she wrote, that \u201cleft lasting impressions on Chelsea and me. \u201d When Clinton was elected to the Senate, she had strong political reasons to care about the mili tary. The Pentagon was in the midst of a long, politically charged process of closing military bases New York State had already been a victim, when Plattsburgh Air Force Base was closed in 1995, a loss of 352 civilian jobs for that   North Country town. New York\u2019s delegation was determined to protect its remaining bases, especially Fort Drum, home of the Army\u2019s 10th Mountain Division, which sprawls over a hundred thousand acres in rural Jefferson County. In October 2001, a month after the   terrorist attacks, Clinton traveled to Fort Drum at the invitation of Gen. Buster Hagenbeck, who had just been named the division\u2019s commander and would be deployed to Afghanistan a month later. Like many of the officers I spoke with, he had preconceptions of Clinton from her years as first lady the woman who showed up at his office around happy hour that afternoon did not fulfill them. \u201cShe sat down,\u201d he recalls, \u201ctook her shoes off, put her feet up on the coffee table and said, \u2018General, do you know where a gal can get a cold beer around here? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d It was the start of a dialogue that stretched over two wars. In the spring of 2002, Hagenbeck led Operation Anaconda, a   assault on Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the    Valley that was the largest combat engagement of the war to date. When the general came back to Washington to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Clinton took him out to dinner on Capitol Hill for her own briefing. They also spoke about the Bush administration\u2019s preparations for war in Iraq, something which Hagenbeck was following anxiously. The general, it turned out, was more of a dove than the senator. He warned her about the risks of an invasion, which was then being   inside the Pentagon. It would be like \u201ckicking over a bee\u2019s nest,\u201d he said. Hagenbeck excused Clinton\u2019s vote in 2002 to authorize military action in Iraq. \u201cShe made a considered call,\u201d he says. And \u201cshe was chagrined, much after the fact. \u201d For him, what mattered more than Clinton\u2019s voting record was her unstinting public support of the military, whether in protecting Fort Drum or backing him during a difficult first year in Afghanistan. Clinton\u2019s education in military affairs began in earnest in 2002, after the Democratic Party\u2019s crushing defeat in midterm elections moved her up several rungs in Senate seniority. The party\u2019s congressional leaders offered her a seat on either the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the Senate Armed Services Committee. She chose Armed Services, spurning a long tradition of New York senators, like Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jacob Javits, who coveted the prestige of Foreign Relations. Armed Services deals with more earthbound issues, like benefits for veterans, and it had long been the preserve of Republican hawks like John McCain. But after   Clinton saw Armed Services as better preparation for her future. For a politician looking to hone   credentials  \u2014   a woman who aspired to be commander in chief  \u2014   it was the perfect training ground. She dug in like a grunt at boot camp. Andrew Shapiro, then Senator Clinton\u2019s   adviser, called upon 10 experts  \u2014   including Bill Perry, who was defense secretary under her husband, and Ashton Carter, who would eventually become President Obama\u2019s fourth defense secretary  \u2014   to tutor her on everything from grand strategy to defense procurement. She met quietly with Andrew Marshall, an octogenarian strategist at the Pentagon who labored for decades in the blandly named Office of Net Assessment, earning the nickname Yoda for his Delphic insights. She went to every committee meeting, no matter how mundane. Aides recall her on   sitting alone in the chamber, patiently questioning a lieutenant colonel. She visited the troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving Day in 2003 and spoke at every significant military installation in New York State. By then  \u2014   30 years after she recalled being rejected by a Marine recruiter in Arkansas  \u2014   Hillary Clinton had become a military wonk. Jack Keane is one of the intellectual architects of the Iraq surge he is also perhaps the greatest single influence on the way Hillary Clinton thinks about military issues. A bear of a man with a jowly, careworn face and   hair, Keane exudes the supreme   you would expect of a retired   general. He speaks with a trace of a New York accent that gives his pronouncements a    urgency. He is also a   member of the   complex, sitting on the board of General Dynamics and serving as a strategic adviser to Academi, the   contractor once known as Blackwater. And he is the chairman of an aptly named think tank, the Institute for the Study of War. Though he is one of a parade of   generals, Keane is the resident hawk on Fox News, where he appears regularly to call for the United States to use greater military force in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. He doesn\u2019t shrink from putting boots on the ground and has little use for civilian leaders, like Obama, who do. Keane first got to know Clinton in the fall of 2001, when she was a freshman senator and he was the Army\u2019s second in command, with a distinguished combat and command record in Vietnam, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. He had expected her to be intelligent,   and politically astute, but he was not prepared for the respect she showed for the Army as an institution, or her sympathy for the sacrifices made by soldiers and their families. Keane was confident he could smell a phony politician a mile away, and he didn\u2019t get that whiff from her. \u201cI read people that\u2019s one of my strengths,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t be fooled, but I\u2019m not fooled often. \u201d Clinton took an instant liking to Keane, too. \u201cShe loves that Irish gruff thing,\u201d says one of her Senate aides, Kris Balderston, who was in the room that day. When Keane got up after 45 minutes to leave for a meeting back at the Pentagon with a Polish general, she protested that she wasn\u2019t finished yet and asked for another appointment. \u201cI said, \u2018O. K. but it took me three months to get this one,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Keane told her dryly. Clinton exploded into a raucous laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that problem,\u201d she promised. She was true to her word: The two would meet many times over the next decade, discussing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Iranian nu clear threat and other flash points in the Middle East. Sometimes he dropped by her Senate office other times they met for dinner or drinks. He escorted her on her first visit to Fort Drum and set up her first trip to Iraq. They generally agreed to forgo talk of politics, but at a meeting in Clinton\u2019s Senate office in January 2007, Keane tried to sell her on the logic of a troop surge in Iraq. The previous month, he had met with President Bush in the Oval Office to recommend that the United States deploy five to eight Army and Marine brigades to wage an urban counterinsurgency campaign only that, he argued, would stabilize a country being ripped apart by sectarian strife. His presentation angered some of Keane\u2019s fellow generals, who feared that such a strategy would deepen Iraq\u2019s dependency and prolong America\u2019s involvement. But it had a big impact on the commander in chief, who soon ordered more than 20, 000 additional troops to Iraq. Clinton was another story. \u201cI\u2019m convinced it\u2019s not going to work, Jack,\u201d she told him. She predicted that the American soldiers patrolling in Iraqi cities and towns would be \u201cblown up\u201d by Sunni militias or Al Qaeda fighters. \u201cShe thought we would fail,\u201d Keane recalls, \u201cand it was going to cause increased casualties. \u201d Politics, of course, was also on her mind. Barack Obama was laying the groundwork for his candidacy in   with a campaign that would emphasize his opposition to the Iraq War and her vote in favor of it  \u2014   a vote that still shadows her in this year\u2019s Democratic primaries. Obama was setting off on a   drive that would net $25 million in three months, sending tremors through Clinton\u2019s political camp and establishing him as a formidable rival. Although she disagreed with Keane about Iraq, Clinton asked him to become a formal adviser. \u201cAs much as I respect you,\u201d he replied, \u201cI can\u2019t do that. \u201d Keane\u2019s wife had health problems that had moved up his retirement from the Army, and he did not, as a policy, endorse candidates. Sometime during 2008  \u2014   he doesn\u2019t remember exactly when  \u2014   Clinton told him she had erred in doubting the wisdom of the surge. \u201cShe said, \u2018You were right, this really did work,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Keane recalls. \u201cOn issues of national security,\u201d he says, \u201cI thought she was always intellectually honest with me. \u201d He and Clinton continued to talk, even after Obama was elected and she became secretary of state. More often than not, they found themselves in sync. Keane, like Clinton, favored more robust intervention in Syria than Obama did. In April 2015, the week before she announced her candidacy, Clinton asked him for a briefing on military options for dealing with the fighters of the Islamic State. Bringing along three young female analysts from the Institute for the Study of War, Keane gave her a     presentation. Among other steps, he advocated imposing a   zone over parts of Syria that would neutralize the air power of the Syrian president, Bashar   with a goal of forcing him into a political settlement with opposition groups. Six months later, Clinton publicly adopted this position, further distancing herself from Obama. \u201cI\u2019m convinced this president, no matter what the circumstances, will never put any boots on the ground to do anything, even when it\u2019s compelling,\u201d Keane told me. He was sitting in the library at his home in McLean, Va. which is lined with books on military history and strategy. His critique of Obama was hardly new or original, but much of it mirrors the thinking of Clinton and her policy advisers. \u201cOne of the problems the president has, which weakens his diplomatic efforts, is that leaders don\u2019t believe he would use military power. That\u2019s an issue that would separate the president from Hillary Clinton rather dramatically. She would look at military force as another realistic option, but only where there is no other option. \u201d Befriending Keane wasn\u2019t just about cultivating a single adviser. It gave Clinton instant entree to his informal network of   and retired generals. The most interesting by far was David Petraeus, a cerebral commander who shared Clinton\u2019s   ambition and whose life stories would mix heady success with humbling setbacks. Both would be accused of mishandling classified information  \u2014   Clinton because of her use of a private server and email address to conduct sensitive government business, a decision that erupted into a political scandal Petraeus because he had given a diary containing classified information to his biographer and mistress (he was eventually charged with a misdemeanor for mishandling classified information). On Clinton\u2019s first trip to Iraq in November 2003, Petraeus, then a   general commanding the 101st Airborne Division, flew from his field headquarters in Mosul to the relative safety of Kirkuk to brief her congressional delegation. \u201cShe was full of questions,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was the kind of gesture that means a lot to a battlefield commander. \u201d On subsequent trips, as he rose in rank, Petraeus walked her through his plans to train and equip Iraqi Army troops, a forerunner of the counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It worked to their mutual benefit: Petraeus was building ties to a prominent Democratic voice in the Senate Clinton was burnishing her image as a friend of the troops. \u201cShe did it the   way,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did it by pursuing relationships. \u201d When Petraeus was sent back to Iraq as the top commander in early 2007, he gave every member of the Senate Armed Services Committee a copy of the U. S.   Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, which he edited during a tour at Fort Leavenworth. Clinton read hers from cover to cover. Although Clinton\u2019s reservations about the surge were valid  \u2014   the stability that the additional troops brought to Iraq didn\u2019t last  \u2014   her opposition to it, like her vote for the war, came back to haunt her. This time, it was her ally Bob Gates who summoned the ghost. In his memoirs, Gates wrote that she confessed to him and the president that her position had been politically motivated, because she was then facing Obama in the Iowa caucuses. (Obama, he wrote, \u201cvaguely\u201d conceded that he, too, had opposed it for political reasons.) Clinton pushed back, telling Diane Sawyer of ABC News that Gates \u201cperhaps either missed the context or the meaning, because I did oppose the surge. \u201d Her opposition, she told Sawyer, was driven by the fact that at that time, people were not going to accept any escalation of the war. \u201cThis is not politics in electoral, political terms,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is politics in the sense of the American public has to support commitments like this. \u201d The next time she found herself in a debate over sending troops into harm\u2019s way, she voiced no such reservations. \u201cWe need maps,\u201d Hillary Clinton told her aides. It was early October 2009, and she had just returned from a meeting in the Situation Room. Obama\u2019s war cabinet was debating how many additional troops to send to Afghanistan, where the United States, preoccupied by Iraq, had allowed the Taliban to regroup. The Pentagon, she reported, had used impressive,   maps to show its plans to deploy troops around the country. The attention to detail made Gates and his commanders look crisp and well prepared the State Department, which was pushing a \u201ccivilian surge\u201d to accompany the troops, looked wan by comparison. At the next meeting, on Oct. 14, the team from State unfurled its own maps to show the deployment of an army of aid workers, diplomats, legal experts and crop specialists who were supposed to follow the soldiers into Afghanistan. Clinton\u2019s fixation with maps was typical of her   in the first great    debate of the Obama presidency. She wanted to be taken seriously, even if her department was less central than the Pentagon. One way to do that was by promoting the civilian surge, the pet project of her friend and special envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke. \u201cShe was determined that her briefing books would be just as thick and just as meticulous as those of the Pentagon,\u201d a senior adviser recalls. She also didn\u2019t hesitate to get into the Pentagon\u2019s business, asking detailed questions about the training of Afghan troops and wading into the weeds of military planning. She resolved not to miss out on anything  \u2014   a determination that may have been rooted in a deeper insecurity about her role in what was to become the most White   administration of the modern era. On the morning of June 8, 2009, she emailed two aides to say: \u201cI heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am. Is there? Can I go? If not, who are we sending?\u201d On Feb. 10, 2010, she dialed the White House from her home, but couldn\u2019t get past the switchboard operator, who didn\u2019t believe she was really Hillary Clinton. Asked to provide her office number to prove her identity, she said she didn\u2019t know it. Finally, Clinton hung up in frustration and placed the call again through the State Department Operations Center  \u2014   \u201clike a proper and properly dependent secretary of state,\u201d as she later wrote to one aide in a   tone. \u201cNo independent dialing allowed. \u201d The Afghan troop debate, a   drama of dueling egos, leaked documents and endless deliberations, is typically framed as a test of wills between the Pentagon\u2019s wily military commanders and an inexperienced young president, with Joe Biden playing the role of devil\u2019s advocate for Obama. While that portrait is accurate, it neglects the role of Clinton. By siding with Gates and the generals, she gave political ballast to their proposals and provided a bullish counterpoint to Biden\u2019s skepticism. Her role should not be overstated: She did not turn the debate, nor did she bring to it any distinctive point of view. But her unstinting support of General McChrystal\u2019s maximalist recommendation made it harder for Obama to choose a lesser option. (McChrystal was later fired by Obama after his aides made derogatory remarks about almost every member of his war cabinet to Rolling Stone magazine she was the exception. \u201cHillary had Stan\u2019s back,\u201d one of his aides told the reporter, Michael Hastings.) \u201cHillary was adamant in her support for what Stan asked for,\u201d Gates says. \u201cShe made clear that she was ready to support his request for the full 40, 000 troops. She then made clear that she was only willing to go with the 30, 000 number because I proposed it. She was, in a way, tougher on the numbers in the surge than I was. \u201d Gates believed that if he could align Clinton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen the commander of Central Command, David Petraeus and himself behind a common position, it would be hard for Obama to say no. \u201cHow could you ignore these Four Horsemen of national security?\u201d says Geoff Morrell, who served as the Pentagon press secretary at the time. Just as Clinton benefited from her alliance with the military commanders, she gave them political cover. \u201cHere\u2019s the dirty little secret,\u201d says Tom Nides, her former deputy secretary of state for management and resources. \u201cThey all knew they wanted her on their side. They knew that if they walked into the Situation Room and they had her, it made a huge difference in the dynamics. When she opened her mouth, she could change the momentum in the room. \u201d David Axelrod recalls one meeting where Clinton \u201ckicked the thing off and pretty much articulated their opinion I\u2019m sure that\u2019s one that they remember. There\u2019s no doubt that she wanted to give them every troop that McChrystal was asking for. \u201d Still, Clinton didn\u2019t prevail on every argument. After agreeing to send the troops, Obama added a condition of his own: that the soldiers be deployed as quickly as possible and pulled out again, starting in the summer of 2011  \u2014   a deadline that proved more fateful in the long run than a difference of 10, 000 troops. Clinton opposed setting a public deadline for withdrawal, arguing that it would tip America\u2019s hand to the Taliban and encourage them to wait out the United States  \u2014   which, in fact, was exactly what happened. In the final days of the debate, Clinton also found herself at odds with her own ambassador in Kabul, Karl Eikenberry. He, too, held different views than she did on the wisdom of a surge, which he put into writing. On Nov. 6, 2009, in a long cable addressed to Clinton  \u2014   and later leaked to The New York Times  \u2014   he made a trenchant, convincing case for why the McChrystal proposal, which she endorsed two weeks earlier in a meeting with Obama, would saddle the United States with \u201cvastly increased costs and an indefinite,   military role in Afghanistan. \u201d Much of Eikenberry\u2019s analysis proved prescient, particularly his warnings about the threadbare American partnership with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. It carried an extra sting because he was a retired   Army general who was the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007. Clinton, who had not asked for the cable, was furious, fearing it could upset a debate in which she and the Pentagon were about to prevail. What the cable made clear was the degree to which the Afghanistan debate was dominated by military considerations. While Clinton did raise the need to deal with Afghanistan\u2019s neighbor, Pakistan, her reflexive support of Gates, Petraeus and McChrystal meant she was not a powerful voice for diplomatic alternatives. \u201cShe contributed to the overmilitarizing of the analysis of the problem,\u201d says Sarah Chayes, who was an adviser to McChrystal and later to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen. In October 2015, the persistent violence in Afghanistan and the legacy of Karzai\u2019s misrule forced Obama to reverse his plan to withdraw the last American soldiers by the end of his presi dency. A few thousand troops will stay there indefinitely. And for all of Clinton\u2019s talk about a civilian surge, it never really materialized. For Clinton, the Afghanistan episode laid bare a vexed relationship between her and Eikenberry, one of the few generals with whom she didn\u2019t hit it off. A   with graduate degrees from Harvard and Stanford, Eikenberry was brilliant but had a reputation among his colleagues for being imperious. Clinton had a similarly chilly relationship with Douglas Lute, another Army lieutenant general with a graduate degree from Harvard, who also fought with Holbrooke. \u201cShe likes the    \u2014   McChrystal, Petraeus, Keane,\u201d one of her aides observes. \u201cReal military guys, not these retired   who go into civilian jobs. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Hillary Clinton\u2019s more muscular brand of American foreign policy is better matched to 2016 than it was to 2008,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, her top policy adviser at the State Department, who plays the same role in her campaign. It was De cem ber 2015, 53 days before the Iowa caucuses, and Sullivan was sitting down with me in Clinton\u2019s sprawling Brooklyn headquarters to explain how she was shaping her message for a campaign suddenly dominated by concerns about national security. Clinton\u2019s strategy, he said, was twofold: Explain to voters that she had a clear plan for confronting the threat posed by Islamic terrorism, and expose her Republican opponents as utterly lacking in experience or credibility on national security. There were good reasons for Clinton to let her inner hawk fly. After the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. Americans\u2019 concern about a major attack on the nation spiked. A   poll taken after Paris showed that a majority, 53 percent, favored sending ground troops to Iraq or Syria, a remarkable shift from the   sentiment that prevailed during most of Obama\u2019s presidency. The Republican candidates were reaching for apocalyptic metaphors to demonstrate their resolve. Ted Cruz threatened to   the Islamic State to test whether desert sand can glow Donald Trump called for the United States to ban all Muslims from entering the country \u201cuntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses. \u201d Yet such spikes in the public appetite for mili tary action tend to be transitory. Three weeks later, the same poll showed an even split, at 49 percent, on whether to deploy troops. Neither Trump nor Cruz favors major new deployments of American soldiers to Iraq and Syria (nor, for that matter, does Clinton). If anything, both are more skeptical than Clinton about intervention and more circumspect than she about maintaining the nation\u2019s   War II military commitments. Trump loudly proclaims his opposition to the Iraq War. He wants the United States to spend less to underwrite NATO and has talked about withdrawing the American security umbrella from Asia, even if that means Japan and South Korea would acquire nuclear weapons to defend themselves. Cruz, unlike Clinton, opposed aiding the Syrian rebels in 2014. He once supported Pentagon budget constraints advocated by his isolationist colleague, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Thus might the gen eral election present voters with an unfamiliar choice: a Democratic hawk versus a Republican reluctant warrior. To thwart the progressive insurgency of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton carefully calibrated her message during the Democratic primaries to align herself closely with Barack Obama and his racially diverse coalition. But as she pivots to the general election, that balancing act with Obama will become trickier. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a huge amount of interest in the press to \u201d Sullivan says. \u201cIt just so easily can become a sport that distracts from her ability to make an affirmative case. \u201d In showing her stripes as a prospective commander in chief, Clinton will no doubt draw heavily upon her State Department experience  \u2014   filtering the lessons she learned in Libya, Syria and Iraq into the sinewy worldview she has held since childhood. Last fall, in a series of policy speeches, Clinton began limning distinctions with the president on national security. She said the United States should consider sending more   troops to Iraq than Obama had committed, to help the Iraqis and Kurds fight the Islamic State. She came out in favor of a partial   zone over Syria. And she described the threat posed by ISIS to Americans in starker terms than he did. As is often the case with Clinton and Obama, the differences were less about direction than degree. She wasn\u2019t calling for ground troops in the Middle East, any more than he was. Clinton insisted her plan was not a break with his, merely an \u201cintensification and acceleration\u201d of it. It\u2019s an open question how well Clinton\u2019s hawkish instincts match the country\u2019s mood. Americans are weary of war and remain suspicious of foreign entanglements. And yet, after the retrenchment of the Obama years, there is polling evidence that they are equally dissatisfied with a portrait of their country as a spent force, managing its decline amid a world of rising powers like China, resurgent empires like Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and lethal new forces like the Islamic State. If Obama\u2019s minimalist approach was a necessary reaction to the maximalist style of his predecessor, then perhaps what Americans yearn for is something in between  \u2014   the kind of   pragmatism that Clinton has spent a lifetime honing. \u201cThe president has made some tough decisions,\u201d says Leon Panetta, who served as Obama\u2019s defense secretary after Bob Gates, and as director of the C. I. A. before David Petraeus. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a mixed record, and the concern is, the president defining what America\u2019s role in the world is in the 21st century hasn\u2019t happened. \u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll do it,\u201d he added, acknowledging the time Obama has left. \u201cCertainly, she would. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561623.5589921}
