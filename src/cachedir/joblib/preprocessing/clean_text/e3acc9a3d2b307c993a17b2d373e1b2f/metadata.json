And while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona ones, the WSJ writes that the latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau\u2019s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor, they had recovered a laptop with 650,000 emails. Many, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.\\n** One-Third of likely voters are less likely to vote for Hillary Clinton following the announcement of a new FBI criminal investigation.\\nDemocrats are going psycho right now as they are in full panic mode. Expect ANYTHING from them now, BUT disregard and ignore any stunt they may pull. Remember this was a prophetic prediction and warning!\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742564098.3724964}
