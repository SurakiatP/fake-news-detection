[The article begins by directly stating that the reason for President Trump\u2019s switch to the   handset is for security reasons: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is finally using an Apple iPhone, despite once calling for a boycott of the company\u2019s products, after concerns that the Android handset he was reportedly using was unsecured. \u201d  \u201cA number of reports have suggested Trump was using a Samsung Galaxy S3 running Google\u2019s Android operating system, a point which has never officially been confirmed,\u201d the article notes. \u201cThe New York Times reported in January that the phone was unsecured. This means that it is vulnerable to hackers, something of great concern because the president of the U. S. would be a key hacking target. \u201d The article then focuses on Trump\u2019s use of the more secure Apple device, citing the president\u2019s past criticism of the iPhone manufacturer for refusing to unlock the phone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook. \u201cDuring a campaign rally last year, Trump called for people to boycott Apple products because the technology giant refused to unlock the iPhone involved in the San Bernardino shootings. In this case, the FBI asked Apple to unlock a phone belonging to the San Bernardino shooter. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the order \u201cchilling\u201d and did not assist. \u201d \u201cDuring a campaign rally last year, Trump called for people to boycott Apple products because the technology giant refused to unlock the iPhone involved in the San Bernardino shootings,\u201d NBC notes. \u201cIn this case, the FBI asked Apple to unlock a phone belonging to the San Bernardino shooter.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2012,  President Trump\u2019s decision to use a more secure mobile phone seems to be a step in the right direction considering the issues surrounding cyber security that were raised during the election. However, NBC appears to cast President Trump\u2019s decision to better protect himself from cyber attacks as a sign of hypocrisy.'"}, "time": 1742628578.2058818}
