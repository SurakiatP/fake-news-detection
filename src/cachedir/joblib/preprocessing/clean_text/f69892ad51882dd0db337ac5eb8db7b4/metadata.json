Mr. Trump told an Israeli newspaper that settlements \u201cdon\u2019t help the process\u201d and that he did not believe that \u201cgoing forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace. \u201d He also did not reaffirm his past vow to move the embassy, saying that it \u201cis not an easy decision\u201d and \u201cwe will see what happens. \u201d The comments amounted to a striking recalibration of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to Israel just five days before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to visit the White House. Mr. Trump and Jared Kushner, his    and senior adviser, have been exploring an   peace initiative that would enlist Arab allies, and a host of Arab leaders have told the new president that provocative   positions would not help. The interview was conducted with Israel Hayom, the newspaper owned by Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and close ally of Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Trump hosted Mr. Adelson and his wife for dinner at the White House on Thursday night, along with Mr. Kushner and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The president\u2019s language in the interview went beyond the carefully written statement issued by the White House last week saying that settlements were not an impediment to peace but they \u201cmay not be helpful. \u201d The statement was seen as a sign that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Netanyahu to hold off contentious moves, at least until their meeting next week. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government has announced the construction of 5, 500 new houses in the occupied West Bank, and the prime minister even raised the idea of building the first entirely new settlement in years. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition pushed through Parliament a new bill retroactively authorizing thousands of houses built on   land that are illegal even under Israeli law. \u201cThey don\u2019t help the process,\u201d Mr. Trump said of settlements in the Israel Hayom interview. \u201cI can say that. There is so much land left. And every time you take land for settlements, there is less land left. \u201d He added: \u201cI am not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s statement on the embassy move was also strikingly different than past comments. Arab leaders have warned him that moving the embassy to Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim, would lead to angry and possibly violent reactions because it would be seen as prejudging a final settlement between the two sides. The last three presidents refused to move the embassy there for that very reason. Last year, Mr. Trump said he would move the embassy \u201cfairly quickly\u201d after taking office. When approached by Boaz Bismuth of Israel Hayom on the eve of his inauguration last month, he reiterated his commitment by saying, \u201cYou know I\u2019m not a person who breaks promises. \u201d But when Mr. Bismuth asked about it on Thursday, Mr. Trump did not repeat his vow. Instead, he said he was studying it. \u201cThe embassy is not an easy decision,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt has obviously been out there for many, many years and nobody has wanted to make that decision. I\u2019m thinking about it very seriously and we will see what happens. \u201d Mr. Trump, who last year blistered his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for not being supportive enough of Israel, said he would not publicly criticize it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to condemn Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael has had a long history of condemnation and difficulty. And I don\u2019t want to be condemning Israel. \u201d But he also said he wanted Israel to compromise to make peace. \u201cI want Israel to be reasonable with respect to peace,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump did not offer support for a   solution, which has been American policy for years. However, he held out the prospect of a regional agreement. \u201cMaybe there is even a chance for a bigger peace than just Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see a level of reasonableness of both parties and I think we have a good chance of doing that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563195.6477163}
