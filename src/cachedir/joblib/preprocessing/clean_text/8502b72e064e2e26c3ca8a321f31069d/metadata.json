He regards himself as above the law.\u201d #ThisWeek pic. twitter.  Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe said President Donald Trump must be impeached.  Tribe said, \u201cHe\u2019s shown no respect for the rule of law. He regards himself as above the law. He thinks it\u2019s appropriate to essentially have a job interview with the FBI director. As we now know, the FBI director wanted to be reappointed. And the president essentially told him, \u2018well, we\u2019ll see. It depends, will you plead loyalty to me?\u2019 Well, kings and monarchs and dictators seek that kind of loyalty. He essentially said, if you assure me that this meddlesome Russia investigation will go away, maybe I\u2019ll keep you on. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s obstruction of justice,\u201d he continued. \u201cEven within the technical term of the criminal code. But they\u2019re not relevant. The most relevant thing, because impeachment is our system\u2019s last resort for someone who treats himself or herself as above the law, most relevant thing is whether this president, by his recent course of action, on top of his violations of the foreign corruption or Emoluments Clause, this president has shown that he cannot be trusted to remain within the law. And our constitution\u2019s last resort for situations of that kind is to get the person out of office. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561878.6399057}
