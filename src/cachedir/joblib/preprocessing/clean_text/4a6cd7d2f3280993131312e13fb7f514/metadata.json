Trump\u2019s most prominent cabinet nominees  \u2014   with their millions in assets and complex business arrangements  \u2014   are moving unusually slowly through the government\u2019s arduous financial disclosure examinations, threatening the quick start promised for the new administration and raising Democratic concerns that their confirmations could   customary ethical safeguards. On Thursday, the ranking Democrats on all 16 Senate committees released a joint statement saying they would block confirmation votes until each nominee of Mr. Trump had cleared an F. B. I. background check, completed a financial disclosure statement and ethics agreement approved by the federal Office of Government Ethics, and \u201csatisfied reasonable requests for additional information. \u201d Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, that panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, engaged in a public spat over Mr. Cardin\u2019s request for three years of tax returns from Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive, Rex Tillerson, who has been picked to be the next secretary of state. \u201cAs is   precedent for nominees considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the committee has not asked Mr. Tillerson to provide copies of his tax returns,\u201d Mr. Corker said. And Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, sent letters to the top ethics officials at 17 government agencies, asking if they had been in touch with officials of the Trump transition, whether they had received financial disclosure statements, and whether any Trump pick \u201crefused to provide any information that you believe is necessary to conduct a conflicts analysis as required by law. \u201d \u201cGiven the large and complex financial holdings and boundless, serious potential for conflicts of interest,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in an email, \u201cthese nominees need to turn over all relevant financial and background information so that senators can thoroughly review their record before going forward with any hearings. \u201d Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks would be among the wealthiest public servants in modern history. That alone presents a significant   challenge to Senate Republicans, who hope to begin confirmation hearings in a few weeks. Mr. Trump\u2019s selection process  \u2014   begun, unlike that of most predecessors, after his election rather than before  \u2014   may have added to the challenge of moving quickly now. \u201cThey need to step on the gas and get it done,\u201d said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush. \u201cThey need to tell the Senate what they are going to do with their assets. \u201d Cabinet nominees undergo rigorous background checks by the F. B. I. and the Office of Government Ethics, as well as a complicated process involving the agencies they are nominated to run. This is to ensure that nominees have no financial conflicts of interest or outstanding tax matters that could later expose them to criminal prosecution. For nominees with extensive financial holdings, preparation for confirmation hearings can take weeks or even months, as was the case with Penny Pritzker, a billionaire who is President Obama\u2019s commerce secretary. Previous new administrations have taken longer to name cabinet picks than Mr. Trump has done, in part because they were doing their own vetting that the Trump transition has largely forgone. Three people who have discussed Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees with officials involved in the screening, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations of a highly secretive government agency, were told of the slow pace, which has alarmed Senate Democrats. Mr. McConnell has said he hopes to move ahead on several of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees \u201con Day 1. \u201d Emails to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team were not returned. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees come with a complex web of financial interests and investments. They include Mr. Tillerson Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner picked to head the Treasury the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr. chosen as commerce secretary and Betsy DeVos, the  \u2019s choice to run the Department of Education. Lawmakers have already raised questions about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s seeming reluctance to turn over his personal financial information. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has tentatively set Jan. 11 for the start of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearing. In keeping with longstanding committee precedent, it has not asked Mr. Tillerson to provide his tax returns, Senator Corker said. \u201cBy all accounts, Mr. Tillerson is currently ahead of schedule in providing information to the committee,\u201d he added. \u201cHe already has submitted a completed nominee questionnaire and will soon submit an extensive financial disclosure. \u201d But Mr. Cardin voiced the fears of some Democrats that Mr. Tillerson and other nominees  \u2014   and Republican committee chairmen  \u2014   may take their cues from Mr. Trump\u2019s unusual decision not to release his own tax returns. \u201cI think it is an important part of vetting this candidate because he has never made public disclosures of this type, as he has worked at Exxon Mobil for his entire career and has never been in public service,\u201d Mr. Cardin wrote on Thursday in a letter to committee Democrats. \u201cMr. Tillerson was actively engaged with many foreign governments that could become relevant if confirmed as secretary of state. The Senate has a responsibility to review all relevant documents during the confirmation process. \u201d Republicans say the concern is misplaced. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will hold the hearing for Mr. Mnuchin, has previously said that Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees \u201cwill undergo the same bipartisan vetting process as the nominees from previous administrations. \u201d This includes scrutiny by the Office of Government Ethics, and his committee\u2019s requirement for three years of a nominee\u2019s most recent federal tax returns. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hatch said on Wednesday that the committee would not schedule a hearing before completion of the bipartisan vetting process. Selections made during a transition are more complicated than those of a sitting president because a nomination cannot be officially made until the new president is sworn in. Candidates typically start to put together their prospective cabinet during the campaign the former governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, conducted an extensive vetting process during his failed 2012 White House run. When an incoming president has chosen a nominee, the transition office works immediately to get forms in order for the ethics office and the F. B. I. The F. B. I. does its own significant vetting, which has been the downfall of some nominees, frequently over tax issues or payments to domestic workers. Often this review is done long before the nomination arrives on Capitol Hill. Federal ethics law requires that financial disclosure forms be submitted no later than five days after a formal nomination, or before a nominee\u2019s hearing, whichever is earlier. Generally, if nominees have any financial entanglements that could create real or potential conflicts of interest, they work with an ethics compliance employee to come up with a plan to address those conflicts. In many cases, though not all, a nominee resolves conflicts through divestiture, the use of a blind trust or a formal recusal from certain matters. This practice protects the public interest, but also the nominee. Cabinet members later found to be acting in their own financial interest in their official capacity can be prosecuted. \u201cIf you have substantial assets, they want some sort of assets agreement,\u201d Mr. Painter said. \u201cThat can take a few weeks, especially with billionaires. \u201d Democrats insist the process cannot be disregarded. \u201cWhen you occupy this country\u2019s highest positions of power, you manage trillions of dollars, enforce more than two centuries of law, control the world\u2019s most powerful military and make decisions that are literally matters of life and death,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cThat\u2019s why nominees need a thorough vetting process, not a rubber stamp. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562188.955413}
