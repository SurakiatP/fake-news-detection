The deal, which was announced by a lawyer representing more than two dozen actors and dancers who were part of the show\u2019s development and first productions, is a major victory for the cast and could have ripple effects in the theater industry, where the huge success of \u201cHamilton,\u201d and the lack of   catalyzed a growing debate about actor compensation. The agreement means that actors will have a piece of \u201cthe profit stream from the play,\u201d Ronald H. Shechtman, a leading labor lawyer in the theater industry who represented the \u201cHamilton\u201d performers, said in a statement. Jeffrey Seller, the lead producer of \u201cHamilton,\u201d a megahit now generating upward of $500, 000 in profit every week on Broadway, confirmed the agreement. Neither Mr. Seller nor Mr. Shechtman would discuss details, some of which remain to be hammered out, and Mr. Shechtman said that the performers were not ready to comment on the deal. Kate Shindle, the president of Actors\u2019 Equity, the labor union representing theater performers, said that while the broader discussion about how actors are compensated for contributions to developing shows will continue, the \u201cHamilton\u201d agreement was significant. \u201cThis should be a real moment of celebration for any actor who feels powerless,\u201d she said. The agreement is unlikely to make any of the performers rich, but the money could make a significant difference in their lives the base salary for a Broadway performer is about $1, 900 a week (stars often make more) and many actors have significant periods of unemployment between jobs. Payments to actors in other shows with   have varied from a few hundred dollars a year to a few thousand dollars a month. The profits from \u201cHamilton,\u201d which will only multiply as it spins off tours in other cities and around the world, has prompted an uncomfortable debate within the theater industry about money and credit for performers who help create hit shows. The debate has been taking place in two settings: within the \u201cHamilton\u201d company and at Actors\u2019 Equity, which has been flooded with expressions of concern from its members. The union has scheduled a special meeting on Monday to hear from actors who have helped develop a number of recent shows. Mary McColl, the executive director of Actors\u2019 Equity, said, \u201cThere should be a place for the actors to participate in the success of a project. \u201d The issue is already having an effect elsewhere in the business. Equity said that some of its members were unhappy, in the wake of \u201cHamilton,\u201d to see that Disney is developing its coming \u201cFrozen\u201d stage musical in a way that will preclude   by the actors initially involved, even though the process is the same one Disney has used for four previous musicals. And the Public Theater, the Off Broadway nonprofit where \u201cHamilton\u201d was partly developed, said it had postponed a developmental chapter of a new musical because of an inability to reach an agreement with performers over potential future  . The issue has a long and tortured history in theater, since the days of \u201cA Chorus Line,\u201d when the dancers involved in that show\u2019s creation famously sold the rights to their life stories for $1 each, but about a year later reached an agreement with the   that allowed them some share of the show\u2019s financial success. In the decades since, some shows have granted performers involved in developing them small shares of future profits  \u2014   often 1 percent, divided among the performers. The   example, often cited by actors in the current debate, is \u201cThe Book of Mormon. \u201d The actors involved in the initial workshops for that show, which opened on Broadway in 2011, still get regular checks, in some cases for several thousand dollars a month, to reflect their contributions to its success. Two shows   by Mr. Seller, \u201cRent\u201d and \u201cAvenue Q,\u201d agreed to share a small part of their profits with performers involved in the development process. But more recently, producers have largely opted to pay actors who help develop shows more up front, in exchange for not granting them a share of profits if  \u2014   as happens relatively rarely  \u2014   the show becomes profitable. For years, many shows have been developed using an Equity workshop contract, under which actors are paid a flat rate of $631 for every   workweek. The actors also get benefits, are entitled to a right of first refusal to their role  \u2014   and to split 1 percent of any future royalty pool for 18 years. But, in more recent years, producers have tended to favor an alternative Equity contract, the developmental lab, under which actors are paid $1, 000 a week but have no right of refusal and no promise of royalty participation. In the early stages of \u201cHamilton,\u201d which was written by and stars   Miranda, Equity sought a workshop contract that would allow actors a share of future royalties, but parties could not reach an agreement. The actors instead signed modified lab contracts that gave them a right of first refusal to their roles, but not royalty participation. They began asking the producers to reconsider, and grant them a share of the profits, in August, as the show was opening on Broadway.'"}, "time": 1742562865.8539474}
