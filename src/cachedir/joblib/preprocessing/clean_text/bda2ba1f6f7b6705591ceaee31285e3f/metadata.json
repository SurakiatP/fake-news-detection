But after 30 years of ranching, Mark and Mary Kaltenbach were not ready for what met them after a wildfire charred their land and more than one million acres of   range this month. Dozens of their Angus cows lay dead on the blackened ground, hooves jutting in the air. Others staggered around like broken toys, unable to see or breathe, their black fur and dark eyes burned, plastic identification tags melted to their ears. Young calves lay dying. Ranching families across this countryside are now facing an existential threat to a way of life that has sustained them since homesteading days: years of cleanup and crippling losses after   wildfires across Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle killed seven people and devoured homes, miles of fences and as much as 80 percent of some families\u2019 cattle herds. But for many, the first job after the fire passed was loading a rifle. \u201cWe did what had to be done,\u201d Mr. Kaltenbach, 69, said. \u201cThey\u2019re gentle. They know us. We know them. You just thought, \u2018Wow, I am sorry. \u2019\u201d \u201cYou think you\u2019re done,\u201d he said, \u201cand the next day you got to go shoot more. \u201d For decades and generations, ranching has defined people\u2019s days. Mr. Kaltenbach would wake up at 4:30 a. m. without an alarm clock. Another family down the road, the Wilsons, checked on the cows between jobs at the hospital and the telephone company. The Wilsons invited their whole family over each spring to round up the calves, vaccinate and tag them. \u201cIt\u2019s our life,\u201d Mrs. Kaltenbach, 57, said. \u201cWe lost our routine. \u201d Beyond the toll of the fire, a frustration also crops up in conversation after conversation. Ranchers said they felt overlooked amid the tumult in Washington, and were underwhelmed by the response of a new president who had won their support in part by promising to champion America\u2019s \u201cforgotten men and women. \u201d \u201cThis is the country that elected Donald Trump,\u201d said Garth Gardiner, driving a pickup across the   Angus beef ranch he runs with his two brothers. They lost about 500 cows in the fires. \u201cI think he\u2019d be doing himself a favor to come out and visit us. \u201d Mr. Gardiner voted for Mr. Trump, and said he just wanted to hear a presidential mention of the fires amid Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets about the rapper Snoop Dogg, the East Coast blizzard and the rudeness of the press corps. \u201cTwo sentences would go a long way,\u201d Mr. Gardiner said. Weeks without snow or rain and   temperatures scraping 80 degrees are threatening to create even more blazes in Western states grappling with the growing fire danger posed by climate change. Hundreds of homes were evacuated this weekend because of a wildfire that erupted in the dry hills near Boulder, Colo. By Monday, the fire was about 80 percent contained. The Kansas fires  \u2014   the largest in state history  \u2014   burned more than 400, 000 acres here in Clark County alone. Ten days later, Mr. Gardiner was still burying cows on his family\u2019s ranch. One by one, an orange loader scooped them off the bare sandy soil and trundled them to a pit being dug by a backhoe. Ranchers said the cattle they had lost were worth more than the $2, 000 they could fetch at an auction. Each cow was an engine that drove their farms and finances, giving birth to new calves every year or producing embryos through artificial insemination that could be implanted into other cows. Emergency programs run by the federal Department of Agriculture  \u2014   which is facing 21 percent cuts under Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal  \u2014   will help ranchers, up to a point. One provides up to $200, 000 per rancher for replacing burned fences. Another offers up to $125, 000 for livestock losses. In response to the fires, the department is planning on Tuesday to announce $6 million in aid to affected farmers and ranchers to help restore their land, water and fences. But at about $10, 000 per mile, Mr. Gardiner said, new fencing alone may cost his ranch about $2 million. His total losses could reach $5 million to $10 million. Like many ranchers out here, he had insurance on his home and equipment, but said insuring so many livestock and so much fence was impossibly expensive. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for freebies here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work our tails off to get this thing rebuilt. We\u2019re going to get the blisters on our hands and roll up our sleeves and do the labor. \u201d He added, \u201cWe could use a little help. \u201d Aaron Sawyers, an agriculture extension agent with Kansas State University, got so upset with the delays in and strings attached to getting relief, and what he called a lackluster response from Washington, that he wrote a Facebook post on Tuesday urging friends to barrage lawmakers to loosen up government money for ranchers to replace fences and rebuild their devastated herds. \u201cThis is our Hurricane Katrina,\u201d Mr. Sawyers said. The political response to the fires convinced him that Washington, even with an administration supported by 83 percent of Clark County voters in the election, was still \u201cout of touch and didn\u2019t care about us. \u201d \u201cNone of them are worth a damn, Republicans or Democrats,\u201d he said. The governors of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have declared emergencies, and members of Congress from the affected states have toured the damaged area and promised help. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s office said that officials were adding up losses to request a presidential disaster declaration. But help did arrive. Thousands of donated hay bales, to feed surviving animals bereft of their grasslands, have been rolling into town on the backs of  . Firefighters arrived from Colorado to help contain and extinguish the blaze. Farming and ranching groups from across the Great Plains sent skeins of fence wire and new metal posts to drive three feet into the soil. Members of   clubs and National FFA Organization chapters drove down to help with the cleanup, sleeping in guest bedrooms and on   floors around the towns of Ashland, Meade and Protection. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to receive,\u201d said Kendal Kay, the mayor of Ashland and president of a community bank here. \u201cIt\u2019s a time we\u2019re realizing we need to receive. \u201d Mary Kaltenbach, 57, said she was not a hugger, but had been embracing neighbors for much of the past week. \u201cYou just do it,\u201d she said. In all, the Kaltenbachs lost 130 cows and about 70 calves. About a dozen of their heifers  \u2014   younger females  \u2014   are now penned in just behind their house, which was spared, near the scorched foundations of two barns that did burn. One evening, the couple grabbed a bucket of feed pellets to check on them. Most romped to eat, but two smaller black cows hung back behind a gate, hobbling forward. \u201cFeet hurt,\u201d Mrs. Kaltenbach said grimly of one. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to work. \u201d About seven miles east, the house that Matt Wilson\u2019s forebears built when they homesteaded in 1884 had withstood financial panics, droughts, the Dust Bowl and other fires, but it burned to ashes in the wildfires. His family also lost eight cows and calves, part of a small herd of about 100 that the family raises in addition to holding   jobs. The newer house where the Wilsons and their six children lived also was destroyed. But they managed to save 1890s photographs of Mr. Wilson\u2019s  : standing in front of the original house, atop a horse on an empty plain, at a county rodeo. They are planning to rebuild and keep ranching. By way of explanation, Mr. Wilson pointed to the photos: \u201cThey didn\u2019t start with much. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562231.2281435}
