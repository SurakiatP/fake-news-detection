The hats went on sale last week in advance of the holiday, celebrated on March 17, and had a   clover  \u2014   instead of a   shamrock  \u2014   stitched on the back. A   clover is not a symbol of Ireland. It is just a plant. On Wednesday afternoon the hats disappeared from Mr. Trump\u2019s online store. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to questions about why the hats were taken off the website. The original advertisements for the hat encouraged Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters to \u201ccapture the luck of the Irish. \u201d Social media users, especially those in Ireland  \u2014   where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular  \u2014   were quick to pounce, as was the news media there. The Irish Independent, a popular daily newspaper, described the   clover as \u201ca sugary, oat piece that you\u2019ll find in a box of Lucky Charms cereal\u201d that \u201chas nothing to do with St. Patrick\u2019s Day or Ireland. \u201d Mixing up the number of leaves on a shamrock is an easy mistake to make, especially in the United States, where St. Patrick\u2019s Day is widely celebrated even by people with no substantive connection to Ireland. The Obama campaign made the same mistake in 2012, producing a line of   campaign swag covered in   clovers (it soon reversed course.) Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, himself an   used a   clover on Twitter last year. Even the Irish beer company Guinness is not immune: It used a   clover in a series of advertisements in Canada last year. Niall O\u2019Dowd, the publisher of several   media outlets, said these   were par for the course on St. Patrick\u2019s Day in the United States, where some of the finer points of Irish culture often get lost in the   melee of parades and bar crawls. (In case you\u2019re wondering why the shamrock is part of the holiday at all, legend has it that St. Patrick used its three leaves to illustrate the Holy Trinity in Christianity.) \u201cThat sort of things is so common,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dowd said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly   that they\u2019ve used a   clover. \u201d Another common misunderstanding is referring to the holiday as \u201cSt. Patty\u2019s Day,\u201d he said. (The Independent sneered about the American pronunciation: \u201cSt. Patty\u2019s Day as they insist on calling it. \u201d) \u201cPatty\u201d is not the nickname used for a man named Patrick. It is the nickname used for a woman named \u201cPatricia. \u201d Men named Patrick  \u2014   including the saint honored on March 17  \u2014   are referred to casually as \u201cPaddy. \u201d Like many Americans, the Republican Party made that mistake, too, in its advertisement for the Trump hat. Mr. O\u2019Dowd said he thought that misspelling was a forgivable offense. \u201cIf you listen to an Irish accent it does sound like \u2018Patty\u2019s Day,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cPeople get offended by it, but I think it\u2019s one of those things that gets overblown. People\u2019s intent is noble, and that\u2019s just how the word sounds to them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563381.635284}
