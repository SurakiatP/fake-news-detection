His body was found on a riverbank on Saturday with gunshot wounds to the head, according to the Washington County coroner, Brian DeClue, who called the death a homicide. In an interview, he said that Mr. Ancona, 51, was killed with \u201ca shotgun of some sort. \u201d Jerrod Mahurin, the prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Ancona was also shot in the head with a   handgun. On Monday, Mr. Ancona\u2019s wife, Malissa Ancona, 44, and stepson, Paul Jinkerson Jr. 24, were charged with a range of crimes in connection with the killing, including   murder and the abandonment of a corpse, according to the St. Francois County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The sheriff said Mr. Ancona was killed at his home last Thursday, and his body was then left at a remote location. Mr. Mahurin said he believed the killing happened because of a marital dispute and was not connected to Mr. Ancona\u2019s membership in the K. K. K. The Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office said that it learned of Mr. Ancona\u2019s disappearance on Friday, shortly before his vehicle was discovered on land owned by the United States Forest Service. His body was found on the banks of the Big River in Belgrade, Mo. the next day by a family who had gone to fish. In an interview with The New York Times this month, Mr. Ancona said he had been a member of the Klan for more than 30 years. He formed the Traditionalist American Knights in 2009. There are at least 29 separate, rival Klan groups currently active in the United States, and they compete with one another for members, dues, news media attention and the title of being the true heir to the Ku Klux Klan, said Mark Potok, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremism in the United States. Most recently, Mr. Ancona was accused by rival Klansmen of being secretly Jewish. \u201cIt is endless infighting,\u201d Mr. Potok said. Mr. Ancona\u2019s group was not considered the largest or the most influential iteration of the Klan, but he was skilled at attracting the spotlight. During the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Mo. after the police killing of Michael Brown, Mr. Ancona\u2019s group passed out leaflets in the city, vowing to use \u201clethal force\u201d against protesters. The fliers got him invited on MSNBC. Shortly after, Mr. Ancona explained his beliefs in an interview with a member of the hacker group Anonymous, which later claimed to have gained access to his group\u2019s files and released his personal information. This year, the group also distributed fliers in several towns in Maine, far from its base in Park Hills, Mo. Mr. Ancona pointed to these operations as a sign of his group\u2019s popularity and reach, but Mr. Potok said it had no more than a few dozen members in chapters in three states: Missouri, Idaho and Pennsylvania. Mr. Ancona promoted the Klan as a nonviolent fraternal organization for white Christian men, something akin to a   group that endorsed the separation of the races and opposed what he called \u201cequality propaganda. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t focus on the negative history,\u201d Mr. Ancona said, adding that he did not understand why people were afraid of the Klan. \u201cWhat Klansman do you ever see go out and see terrorize anyone?\u201d But the group\u2019s website and fliers contained a more violent message, including images of hooded Klansmen brandishing nooses, racist cartoons of   and the letters \u201cKKK\u201d engulfed in flames. In one picture, which appeared to be manipulated, Mr. Ancona stood before a burning cross. \u201cThey want to portray us as all toothless, redneck tobacco chewers,\u201d Mr. Ancona said this month. \u201cSome of us are! But some of us are college educated. I am a business owner,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just believe in promoting traditional American values. \u201d Mr. Ancona dismissed the Klan\u2019s violent history as the work of \u201ca few bad apples\u201d in another era. He said killings attributed to the group during the civil rights era were the work of government agents, like those who infiltrated civil rights groups at the time. \u201cI\u2019d say that operation cointelpro really never ended,\u201d he said. In reality, the K. K. K. has killed scores of people since it was founded in 1865, the vast majority of them  . Many of the crimes believed to be committed by the Klan were not investigated, so the precise number of its victims may never be known. \u201cFrank Ancona posed as the kinder, gentler Klansman, but he was really none of those things,\u201d Mr. Potok said. \u201cA lot of these characters seem like jokes  \u2014   and some of them really are  \u2014   but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not incredibly dangerous. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562668.5327635}
