While there are numerous factors to take into consideration in the event of a nuclear war on U.S. soil, we\u2019ve done our best to answer some of the most commonly asked questions, in the simplest and most understandable of terms.\\nWhich Areas Would be Hit, and How Far Would the Fallout Reach? On the topic of which regions of the U.S. would be hit; part of it is left up to guess work, as we are unable to fully predict the aggressing nation\u2019s tactics, but then much of it is also based on logic. For example, any nation that strikes the U.S. will want to disable their nukes, so we can easily surmise that areas such as North Dakota would be obliterated.\\nActive nuclear energy plants would also make good targets, as the added nuclear energy from the reactors would maximize destruction. And then of course, there are the major government facilities that would be targeted, at least, those that are known of \u2013 unfortunately, it\u2019s safe to assume an aggressing nation\u2019s intelligence would have a better idea of the U.S. government\u2019s \u201csoft spots\u201d than the average American citizen.\\nBefore we get too far ahead of ourselves, however, let\u2019s go with what we know; what kind of targets would the U.S. go for? In the case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, numerous military personnel, politicians, and now historians claim that the first bomb was dropped to prove it could be done, and the second bomb was dropped to display the United States\u2019 strength to Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union, who was originally aligned with the U.S. and Britain during WWII, but who the U.S. knew would become a problem once the war was over, (Foner, 2014, p. 887-949).\\nWhile we are aware there are numerous citizens who, to this day, refuse to believe any other version of events than the original government narrative, the point is, we can\u2019t use the cases of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as an accurate indicator of the type of targets the U.S. would choose. Fortunately though, we do have a detailed list of targets the U.S. created in 1956 \u2013 in the event of war with the Soviet Union \u2013 that was released through the National Archives and Records Administration . The list includes major cities for \u201c systematic destruction ,\u201d including areas that contain \u201c Agricultural Equipment \u201d and \u201c Transformers, Heavy .\u201d Most horridly though, was a target simply titled \u201c Population .\u201d\\nYep. The almighty, all wise, glorious, wholesome and righteous, baseball-loving, apple pie-eating, land of the free, and home of the brave, planned to target large populations of innocent civilians, and it\u2019s with that in mind we can surmise that largely populated areas would be potential targets here in the States, as well.\\nProvided below are two maps created by FEMA, the first of which is from 1990, and shows the presumed targets the Soviets would have hit in the event of a nuclear attack. \u201cFallout,\u201d according to the University of Notre Dame , is described as the mixture of earth and/or water that has entered the rising fireball caused from the detonation of a nuclear bomb near the Earth\u2019s surface. This mixes with the radioactive debris of the explosion at an early stage, and is then blown into the troposphere and lower stratosphere, creating fallout. The most lethal fallout is indicated by the darkest coloration, while the lesser lethal fallout is indicated with yellow:\\nSource: FEMA\\nIn this map, FEMA shows a sample fallout pattern we could expect in a nuclear attack:\\nSource: FEMA\\nHow Long Would the Fallout Last? After being blown into the troposphere and lower stratosphere, \u201c the material is then re-distributed over polar (3-12 months) or equatorial regions (8-24 months). Fall-out removal times (defined in terms of half-life) ranges from 10 to 24 months depending upon seasonal conditions, most rapid during spring, slow in summer ,\u201d again, this is according to the University of Notre Dame, (source above).\\nWhere Would Government Officials and the \u201cElite\u201d Go in the Event of a Nuclear Attack?'"}, "time": 1742561820.582029}
