[In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, Hungary\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, pulled no punches in describing Europe\u2019s dearth of values because of its refusal to embrace its own history.  \u201cWhile everyone speaks very hypocritically about tolerance and accepting others,\u201d Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said, \u201cwe must ask how it is possible to respect others with their religions, traditions, and history if we don\u2019t respect our own. \u201d \u201cSo if you don\u2019t respect your own culture, heritage and religion, you will not be able to respect those of others. That\u2019s our understanding at least,\u201d he said. The Foreign Minister was in Italy to oversee the rebuilding of a parish church in the town of Tolentino that suffered structural damage during recent earthquakes. After receiving an appeal for aid, the Hungarian government donated 480, 000 euros to the church of the Sacred Heart and Saint Benedict in Tolentino to pay for its reconstruction. The church was hit by a 6. 6 magnitude earthquake that struck central Italy on October 30. Knowing that the Hungarian government is committed to rediscovering and safeguarding the Christian roots of Europe, the prior of the church, Andrea Carradori, wrote to Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n appealing for aid, and received a favorable response. In his interview with Breitbart News, Minister Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said that during his visit he spoke with engineers and planners of the reconstruction, which will begin at the end of this month and will conclude in November with a   of the church. Last fall, Hungary became the first country in the world to establish a government department dedicated to addressing the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and Europe. \u201cChristianity is the most persecuted religion in the world,\u201d Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 told Breitbart. \u201cFour out of every five people killed for their faith are Christians, yet for some reason this fact has not been duly recognized or addressed,\u201d he said. To date, Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said, the Hungarian government has donated 5 million euros to aid persecuted Christians in the Middle East. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand why people don\u2019t speak out about the fate of the Christian communities in the Middle East where they suffer intense persecution, discrimination, and threats to their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t like the policy of bringing them away from their homeland, because by doing so you eliminate the Christian communities there,\u201d he said. So Hungary has opted to offer financial help to the persecuted Christians in the local communities. \u201cWe gave 1 million euros to the Syrian catholic church,\u201d he said, \u201canother million euros to the Syrian orthodox church. In Iraq, we rebuilt houses for 200 Christian families who will now be able to return. We spent almost another half million covering the expenses of repairing a hospital in Erbil. \u201d \u201cWe also made the decision to reconstruct Christian churches in Lebanon because we want to help these communities to be able to stay,\u201d he said. By contrast, Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said, much of Europe has bought into an unhealthy form of secularism, embarrassed about their Christian faith. \u201cMany European nations aspire to being cosmopolitan, and view Christianity as retrograde, unmodern and outdated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hold the opposing view. \u201d \u201cChristianity is critical for the future of Hungary and of Europe, because neither the nation nor the continent can be successful without getting back to the Christian roots. These are the values upon which the whole European integration was founded,\u201d he said. \u201cHistorically, European integration was most successful when it was based on true democratic values and Christian democratic policies,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that as we move further from our Christian roots \u2014  from the anchors of our civilization \u2014  we lose ground, and when you lose ground you simply have no hope for a better future,\u201d he said. Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said that his country is concerned that the western world has fallen into a hypocritical approach toward religious persecution. \u201cIf you look at declarations or conclusions or decisions of European or global formats you will hardly ever find the expression \u2018protection of Christian communities.\u2019 You might find reference to the protection of religious minorities, but why is there never a mention of Christians as the most persecuted religion in the world?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe see a very worrying signal that Christianophobia is becoming the last acceptable form of discrimination. \u201d \u201cThis is something we find entirely unacceptable, entirely unacceptable,\u201d he said.
