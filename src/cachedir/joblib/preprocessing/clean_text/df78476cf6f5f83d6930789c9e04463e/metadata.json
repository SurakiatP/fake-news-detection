He shouldn\u2019t be eating a biscuit because he is on a long, difficult sojourn here through the holidays at Duke Diet  Fitness Center to try to lose 100 pounds and stop associating food with love. And biscuits are his Proustian madeleines, evoking all the love he got from his grandmother growing up in humble circumstances in nearby Durham. But Andr\u00e9 has been going through a rough patch with his friends, and he needs a bit of carb comfort, as we listen to the morning medley soundtrack of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in the lobby of the genteel Siena Hotel before he heads off to Duke for a more spartan breakfast in a   cafeteria. It\u2019s my fault, too, because I\u2019m pressing him on a sore subject he is reluctant to discuss: Melania Trump. The       Monsieur Vogue, as he is known, cloaks his voluminous red puffer coat over his mountainous form, so that only his big brown eyes and navy Filson knit cap are showing. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d he says, well aware of my fashion ignorance, \u201cthis is a Norma Kamali sleeping bag coat. \u201d Then he offers his declaration: \u201cYou make the choice to be in Trumpland or you make the choice to eject yourself from the horror of Trumpland. I\u2019ve made my choice not to be part of Trumpland. \u201d But, I point out, Donald Trump was bragging on the trail only the day before that he had just had a meeting with Andr\u00e9\u2019s Vogue compadre and fellow Hillary supporter Anna Wintour. At first, Andr\u00e9 has a hard time believing that Ms. Wintour would venture anywhere near the dreaded Trump Tower. I have to actually show him the story and get it confirmed with the Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks. But finally he shrugs under his puffery. \u201cAs for Anna Wintour going to Mr. Trump, she\u2019s a powerful woman, she\u2019s running an empire, she\u2019s the editorial director of Cond\u00e9 Nast,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t judge her for going to a meeting. She\u2019s a professional, powerful woman. That\u2019s all I have to say. \u201d I have flown here to see if Andr\u00e9 can shed some light on Melania, the sultry enigma of Trumpworld, the only reserved member of what is shaping up to be the most bellicose takeover in modern times. As everyone else rushes in to blow up the capital, as Ivanka shops for houses in Georgetown and office space at the White House, as headlines cascade about how Ivanka will be the real first lady, Melania has virtually disappeared. We see more of her doppelg\u00e4nger on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d than we do the real Slovenian Sphinx, who is hanging back in New York so her    son, Barron, can finish the school year. Melania\u2019s absence from the stage has not stopped a raging battle in the fashion world about her  \u2014   a sequel to the boycott during the campaign against Ivanka\u2019s brand and a microcosm of the fight being replayed across the country about whether to \u201cnormalize\u201d the Trumps or whether to keep shouting from the rooftops, \u201cThis is not normal! ,\u201d as my colleague Charles Blow urged this week. Andr\u00e9\u2019s friend Tom Ford said he was not likely to dress the former fashion model and future first lady because \u201cshe\u2019s not necessarily my image. \u201d (Ford once spent time after a Helmut Newton memorial trying to get Melania to do something about the Donald\u2019s hair, but Melania merely murmured in her Gabor accent, \u201cI like him the way he is. \u201d) Marc Jacobs told Women\u2019s Wear Daily that he would rather put his energy \u201cinto helping out those who will be hurt by Trump and his supporters. \u201d The French designer Sophie Theallet, a favorite of Michelle Obama\u2019s, published an open letter saying she would not dress Melania to protest Donald Trump\u2019s \u201crhetoric of racism, sexism and xenophobia. \u201d Other designers, like Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera, have riposted that they would be proud to dress the Trump women. It is a particularly sensitive matter since Melania follows Michelle, beloved by the fashion world, as The New York Times\u2019s Vanessa Friedman wrote recently, for elevating the industry \u201cbeyond the superficial to the substantive,\u201d by framing clothing \u201cas a collection of values: diversity, creativity, entrepreneurship. \u201d As David Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University, noted, Michelle was also a bonanza, generating $2. 7 billion in a single year for the companies she showcased. Andr\u00e9 has particular insight into Melania\u2019s style since, while on Vogue assignment, he went to couture shows with her in Paris and helped her choose her Dior wedding gown, and later flew with her in   splendor on the Trump plane as Donald scarfed down Oreos and talked about how Jude Law was no Cary Grant. As Andr\u00e9 told me in the fall when I interviewed him, he came away impressed with the Trump women. He called Melania charming and private, \u201csoign\u00e9e and polished\u201d with \u201cimpeccable\u201d manners and legs that are \u201ca long drink of water,\u201d and said she had a gift for standing on      stiletto heels. \u201cShe\u2019s very much like a high, super, superglamorous Stepford Wife,\u201d he told me. He also said that she was the most fastidiously groomed and exquisitely moisturized person he\u2019d ever met. (He now gives that honor to Kim Kardashian West.) At the    wedding, which he attended with Ms. Wintour, he noticed that \u201ceven then you could tell that Ivanka was going to be a very bright star. She had on a   dress. \u201d But Andr\u00e9 walked into a sartorial buzz saw when, amid buzz that he might be called on to give Melania advice about her Inaugural gown, he echoed some of those sentiments recently to a Daily Mail reporter, saying that Melania was \u201ca wonderful person to be with\u201d and that she \u201cwill be one of the great stars in the administration. \u201d He capped it off with optimism: \u201cI hope there will be a great, great Trump presidency. \u201d It didn\u2019t take long for the guillotine to fall. One friend emailed him, \u201cOh my God, you have gone to the Evil Empire! !!!!\u201d He agonized about the \u201ctragedy of ruptured friendships\u201d to me in an email, saying about Melania: \u201cShe\u2019s a nice person. I do not endorse Trumpism on any level. So why can\u2019t one be positive and want her to shine? I mean, it\u2019s good she cares about napkins, crystal, dinner plates with gilded edges to the point of over the top, and abundant flower arrangements. In the end, why pick on her when they should be picking on her husband\u2019s billionaire cabinet and his seeming readiness to turn the country back towards oppression,     etc. \u201d As we sit in the hotel lobby, he muses: \u201cI\u2019m not a big person in the world. I\u2019m maybe a big figure in the fashion world. I mean, sort of iconic. But I don\u2019t want to get phone calls in the middle of the night, telling me I\u2019ve gone over to Trumpland and I\u2019m going to Darth Vader because I said nice things about Melania. I voted for Hillary Clinton. I registered in North Carolina because it mattered. I went through hoops of fire to get my absentee ballot. And, quite frankly, I thought she would have brought back the pantsuit. I thought the gray trouser suit designed by Ralph Lauren she wore with the purple satin shell and the lapels matching the blouse was brilliant. The elegant anthracite gray dry wool actually was slimming. \u201cMelania, who opted at 3 a. m. for a palazzo jumpsuit, with one arm exposed and a flounce over the other  \u2014   it seemed to me too    a huge,   jumpsuit. Trying too hard. And I am so tired of the long hair falling on both sides of her face. She has to upgrade her coiffure. \u201d But isn\u2019t he worried that many of those on the left who complain about Trump as a dictator are acting dictatorial? Not one good word can ever be said about anything that happens for the next four or eight years? Is it fair to hold Melania and Ivanka responsible? Or are they putting a lovely gloss on some of Trump\u2019s unsavory rhetoric and actions? \u201cListen, Melania made her choice,\u201d he replies. \u201cShe married the man, so she\u2019s got to go with the territory. She\u2019s Mrs. Trump. \u201d I remind Andr\u00e9 that he told me that, at the 2005 wedding, it seemed as if \u201cDonald Trump was a cool guy. \u201d \u201cHe became the master of darkness, the master of the dark empire, as he became more powerful, as he started with birtherism and in the campaign,\u201d Andr\u00e9 says now. \u201cBirtherism is terrible. It was a terrible thing he did to Obama. And he never let go. \u2018Make America great again.\u2019 A lot of people think that means make America white again. \u201d I say that a friend of mine, the writer David Israel, is now calling it the   House. \u201cPeople are really afraid of these dark, dark institutions of bigotry and   that have come out from under the rocks like creepy snakes and come up to rear their heads up like cobras,\u201d Andr\u00e9 agrees. \u201cPeople seem to have put all their egregious things on the back burner. Melania plagiarized Michelle Obama\u2019s speech. Let\u2019s just wait and see what happens on Jan. 20. I don\u2019t want Trump to fail, and I don\u2019t want Melania Trump to fail. But I\u2019m not going to sit here and say any more positive things, because I\u2019d get crucified from personal friends. \u201d So the Trumps should never get a full measure of respect? \u201cDid the Congress ever treat Obama as a president?\u201d Andr\u00e9 snaps back. \u201cDid they plot in a restaurant the night he was inaugurated to filibuster everything for eight years? This country has elected a president who is on audiotape saying I\u2019m a star and I can do whatever I want with women, grab them in the vagina. Dignity has gone out the door. He\u2019s causing me much ire. He just said, \u2018My cabinet has the highest I. Q.\u2019 His cabinet of mostly white men. That\u2019s a dog whistle. \u201d Trump had come down to the bouquet of microphones the day before with Kanye West, whose wedding Andr\u00e9 had attended and praised as even more astonishing than the Trump wedding because the rehearsal dinner was at Versailles, not just a Florida ballroom gussied up to look like Versailles. But even Kanye\u2019s visit did not impress Andr\u00e9. \u201cListen to me,\u201d he instructs. \u201cThere is a lot of marzipan here. Marzipan is the glaze you put on a cake, a superficial glazed layer. It\u2019s all marzipan, it\u2019s all optics. \u201d Speaking of optics, I tell Andr\u00e9 that the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party said she didn\u2019t mind that Melania had been a model, noting that Betty Ford worked as a model. And she didn\u2019t care if she had been an \u201cadventuress\u201d seeking a wealthy husband. But she did not like Melania\u2019s photo shoot of racy pictures with another woman, and felt she could not accept her as first lady because of that. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge a person by pictures,\u201d Andr\u00e9 responds. \u201cShe was a model. She took pictures. \u201d I mention that it\u2019s passing strange that Melania\u2019s project is fighting cyberbullying when her husband is a cyberbully. Andr\u00e9 rolls his eyes. Andr\u00e9\u2019s favorite first ladies are Michelle Obama and Jackie Kennedy. Of Jackie he says, \u201cI would have loved to give her advice, even about what to wear to the beach. \u201d The night before, we had a tasty   dinner of grilled salmon, broccoli and eggplant at the diet and fitness center\u2019s cafeteria. This is Andr\u00e9\u2019s fifth time here. I asked him if it was true that Anna Wintour and Oscar de la Renta once had an intervention with him about his weight. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cAnna Wintour called an intervention in the conference room at Vogue one morning. And I was escorted downstairs by a fellow staff member to one of the executive dining rooms. And I said to this person, \u2018Am I about to be fired for something?\u2019 And I walked into the room, and there was an intervention going on. And Oscar and his wife and Anna Wintour and my minister, Reverend [Calvin O.] Butts, had been called into the room. They were ready to send me to the Duke Diet  Fitness Center the very next day, and they\u2019d already made the reservation. But, of course, I angrily rejected it because I was emotionally not ready to come, so I got up and I quietly left the room. \u201d About a year later, he finally made the decision himself to come to Duke and left straight from the Trump wedding at    on a Sunday afternoon. When he was a child, his grandmother worked every day to support him, cooking, washing and ironing. But on Sunday mornings, she would make him a special pan of biscuits and \u201cthe best\u201d chocolate cake. \u201cSo my weaknesses are anything I associate with childhood, which I associate with love,\u201d he said. But he is weaning himself from bread and sugar and has already lost 28 pounds. I made one last attempt to press him for an idea of what Melania will be like compared to other first ladies. We know there will be opulence. We know that she loves Valentino and Chanel and Manolo and fur and diamonds and that she doesn\u2019t like prints or going without makeup. When Melania did the Vogue cover, the writer Sally Singer said that the bride of Trump, compared in the piece to a Bond girl, had \u201ca slightly   idea of femininity\u201d because she refused to pose for Mario Testino without makeup or perfectly styled hair. \u201cShe has those impossibly high   towering stilettos,\u201d Andr\u00e9 said. \u201cClearly, her clothes will cling in the right places, accentuate her figure and her   long tresses. Get ready for   waists, hourglass silhouettes and pencil skirts. She is already into   which Jackie Kennedy wore by Oleg Cassini. Melania likes monotone matching coats and beige dresses, but that hair will always be flying once she goes down the stairs of Air Force One. \u201cShe\u2019s very private. She just wants to be a mother. It\u2019s very similar to Jackie O, who also wanted to keep her kids out of the fray. When Barron was first born, she used to say: \u2018I\u2019m going off to play with Barron. I just want to spend time with Barron.\u2019 So, in a way, I think that she\u2019s maintaining her privacy with him and maintaining a kind of dignity because she\u2019s not making statements. I don\u2019t think that she would try to change the White House in any way. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what she\u2019s interested in. \u201d She never tried to modify the gaudy \u201980s gilt in the   Trump Tower penthouse or the rushing fountain in the middle  \u2014   a style of d\u00e9cor described by the Trump biographer Timothy O\u2019Brien as Louis XIV on acid. As Andr\u00e9 has noted, Melania is not \u201ca disrupter. \u201d But Trump is. \u201cI wish them the best,\u201d Andr\u00e9 said. \u201cI want suddenly to see that she has incredible style, wake up and say, \u2018Oh my God, look, isn\u2019t that great?\u2019 I really do think that there\u2019s hope. We have to wait and see. As Sergei Diaghilev told Jean Cocteau, \u2018Astonish me.\u2019 \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563793.9590743}
