The Mary Celeste, an American merchant ship, set sail from New York on this day in 1872, bound for Italy. About a month later, the vessel was found adrift in the Atlantic, less than two weeks after the last dated entry in the boat\u2019s log. The captain, his wife and young daughter, and the crew were gone. The discovery set off one of the world\u2019s most enduring maritime mysteries. Pirates, mutiny, a waterspout, a seaquake and even a giant squid attack have all been posited. A short story by Arthur Conan Doyle fueled more speculation. Foul play was possible, according to an 1873 account in The Times, citing a bloody sword found on board. Also left behind were personal items and the Mary Celeste\u2019s cargo of denatured alcohol. Missing were navigational tools and the ship\u2019s lifeboat, lending support to a theory put forward in the 2007 documentary \u201cThe True Story of the Mary Celeste. \u201d Some machinery was inoperative, leaving the captain no way to check whether the ship had taken on water in a recent storm. He might have mistakenly thought the ship was sinking and ordered an evacuation. \u201cThere\u2019s so much nonsense written about this legend,\u201d the director said when her film was released, adding, \u201cThe research goes on. \u201d Des Shoe contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
