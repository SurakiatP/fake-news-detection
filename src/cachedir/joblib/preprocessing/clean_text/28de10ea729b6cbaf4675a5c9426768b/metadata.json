The controversial Republican, who was elected the 50th governor of the Hoosier State, has been a long-time proponent of a \u201cBiblical view\u201d on homosexuality and as a member of Congress stated that the legislative branch \u201cshould oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a \u2018discrete and insular minority\u2019 entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.\u201d \\n\u201cIt[gay conversion therapy] was instrumental in helping me overcoming certain urges,\u201d said the Vice President elect in an interview with Fox News. \u201cWith God\u2019s help, and the work of many of his therapists, I was able to seek the straight path when I was a younger man. If it wasn\u2019t for that, I would have never been able to marry.\u201d \\nConversion therapy is psychological treatment or spiritual counseling designed to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual. Such treatments are controversial and are a form of pseudoscience. However many orthodox and fundamentalist Christians believe that it does work, citing numerous examples of success. In more ancient times prior to 1981, conversion therapies in the United States and Western Europe included ice-pick lobotomies, chemical castration and various hormonal treatments. Efforts were largely concentrated on men, as female homosexuality was generally viewed as \u201chot.\u201d This split along gender lines was due American\u2019s general stupidity. \\nMany of Mike Pence\u2019s classmates at Indiana University said the young Pence struggled with \u201cidentity issues.\u201d \\n\u201cOh Mike was always a well-groomed sharp dresser,\u201d said University of Chicago Professor James Badwater who was a dorm roommate of Mr. Pence in 1983. \u201cHe was private and kept to himself. He had a large collection of Men\u2019s fitness magazines and listened to Wham! continually. He got into the conversion thing the next year, and then immediately married Karen [Mike Pence\u2019s wife] the following year. It\u2019s going to be great to have our first gay Vice President.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s unclear how this news will impact the Donald Trump administration, if at all, however many GOP insiders maintain that this demonstrates the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to diversity and the \u201cwidening\u201d of the party\u2019s platform to be more inclusive of what have traditionally been party outsiders.'"}, "time": 1742561771.3683152}
