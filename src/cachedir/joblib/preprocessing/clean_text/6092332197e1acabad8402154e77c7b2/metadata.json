See \u201c Weinered: FBI re-opens investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u201c \\nExperts, such as Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein, say that only the discovery of something truly awful would lead the FBI to reopen its investigation at such a late date, with just days to go before the election. \\nNow, a major U.S. newspaper \u2014 the Chicago Tribune that endorsed libertarian candidate Gary Johnson for president \u2014 is saying what needs to be said: Democrats should ask Hillary Clinton to step down, or risk her being elected President who begins her term of office facing a criminal investigation. Note: Founded in 1847, Chicago Tribune is the 8th largest newspaper, by circulation, in the United States. \\nBelow is Chicago Tribune reporter John Kass\u2019 stunning article in its entirety. \\nDemocrats should ask Clinton to step aside \\nby John Kass \u2022 October 29, 2016 \\nHas America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday\u2019s FB I announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state? \\nWe\u2019ll find out soon enough. \\nIt\u2019s obvious the American political system is breaking down. It\u2019s been crumbling for some time now , and the establishment elite know it and they\u2019re properly frightened. Donald Trump, the vulgarian at their gates, is a symptom, not a cause. Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect. \\nFBI director James Comey\u2019s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious. \\nThis can\u2019t be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl. But it can be about the laptop of Weiner\u2019s wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and emails between her and Hillary. It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been \u201creckless\u201d with national secrets, but said he could not recommend prosecution. \\nSo what should the Democrats do now? \\nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \\nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately , and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \\nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \\nSince Oct. 7, WikiLeaks has released 35,000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta release another 15,000 emails. \\nWhat if she is elected? Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East, and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president. Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls, wringing her hands. \\nThe best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now . It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media \u2014 fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political action committee \u2014 should begin demanding it. \\nBut what will Hillary do? \\nShe\u2019ll stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey. For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence. \\nShe\u2019ll remind the nation that she\u2019s a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women. If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked, the Clintons should probably leak it now. Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims, which she has never been . \\nRemember that Bill Clinton leveraged the \u201cYear of the Woman.\u201d Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him. But the political left \u2014 most particularly the women of the left \u2014 defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas. \\nIf you take a step back from tribal politics, you\u2019ll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She\u2019d never be hired. \\nAs secretary of state she kept classified documents on the home-brew server in her basement, which is against the law. She lied about it to the American people. She couldn\u2019t remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI. Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers. Her husband, Bill, met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a half-hour, and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids. \\nAnd there was no prosecution of Hillary. \\nThat isn\u2019t merely wrong and unethical. It is poisonous. \\nAnd during this presidential campaign, Americans were confronted with a two-tiered system of federal justice: one for standards for the Clintons and one for the peasants. \\nI\u2019ve always figured that, as secretary of state, Clinton kept her home-brew email server \u2014 from which foreign intelligence agencies could hack top secret information \u2014 so she could shield the influence peddling that helped make the Clintons several fortunes. \\nThe Clintons weren\u2019t skilled merchants. They weren\u2019t traders or manufacturers. The Clintons never produced anything tangible. They had no science, patents or devices to make them millions upon millions of dollars. \\nAll they had to sell, really, was influence. And they used our federal government to leverage it. \\nIf a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates, then we\u2019ll learn plenty about ourselves in the coming days, won\u2019t we? \\nJohn Kass concluded his article with the observation that a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates . \\nSo what do the comments from some of the readers of Kass\u2019 article say about the people and this country? Below is a sample: \\nMerryPrankster: Real journalists should ask John Kass to step aside. \\nmillekj61: Do you actually \u201cthink\u201d before you write? There are 9 days to go before the election, who do you suggest they substitute for her? \\npagewerks: Did you even do the slightest research? The email \u201cscandal\u201d you\u2019re panting over is non-existent, and apparently has to do with another investigation. But don\u2019t let that stop you from making a damn fool of yourself. \\nMChicago99: What is unfathomable about this column and the comments is how disconnected from reality and truth it and the comments are. There has been no reopening of the investigation. THE emails in question are probably all duplicates of emails the FBI has already examined. The FBI did not find anything illegal in Clinton\u2019s use of the personal server. Just a desperate ploy to throw last minute obstacles into the election process. \\nWavo: I believe it is time for you to retire from your \u201cestablishment\u201d job at the Tribune John. Your shtick is tiresome and inflammatory. Maybe you should consider a second act over at Breitbart\u2026they and their readers seem to love your work. \\nlarry_wesbsite: You Trumpites actually want national socialism under a national socialist leader who will ride roughshod over the Constitution seeking what you think are simple fast answers to complex, difficult questions and problems. Maybe you will learn or just blame Trump and move on to the next demagogue. All of us will pay the cost for your mistakes. \\ndsm606: Sorry angry old white man. I\u2019m still not voting for Trump. Nice try, though. \\nJim Kaestner: I am tired of tribune columnists telling me how to vote, who to support. Go tell Trump to quit, he has admitted to sexual assault. \\nbluedemondan: Excuse me, you sure this isn\u2019t The Onion? I usually confuse The Onion with the Trib\u2019s editorials. \\nJNAlbukerk: Kass have you no shame sir? Convicting someone with no evidence? Clinton is the most vetted and experienced candidate in history. Until you have evidence otherwise it is you who should step aside as you have abused the power your employment has granted you. \\nYou can reach reporter John Kass by email () or by Twitter (Twitter@John_Kass). \\n~Eowyn'"}, "time": 1742561755.540794}
