{"duration": 0.12796354293823242, "input_args": {"text": "'Lloyd Billingsley \\n\u201cPresidential debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton included a third participant: Vladimir Putin, standing in the background, stealthily inserting himself in the process.\u201d Putin\u2019s Russia \u201cuses deniable cyber-hooliganism to actively prank the American political system. And it\u2019s taking a toll. . . This is the Putin Playbook. Steal, cheat, attack, disrupt, mislead, confuse. If caught, lie and deny.\u201d And it gets worse. \\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Republican presidential nominee reinforces this narrative, referring to a \u2018rigged\u2019 system and an indictable opponent. His outbursts follow years of domestic political discord, where comity is history, crazy seems the new normal, and a sitting president can be heckled with \u2018You lie!\u2019\u201d \\nAll told, the piece reads like a Clinton press release, but it\u2019s actually \u201cPutin\u2019s powerful playbook: Hack, steal, disrupt, mislead, confuse,\u201d in the October 30, Sacramento Bee , two days after the Comey email bombshell. The author is Markos Kounalakis, billed as \u201ca senior fellow at Central European University and visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.\u201d That doesn\u2019t quite capture the man and his connections with the Clintons, which have shown up in Wikileaks. \\nMr. Kounalakis\u2019 author line fails to reveal that he is married to Eleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis, daughter of real-estate tycoon Angelo Tsakopoulos. According to Greek USA Reporter , Angelo is a \u201ctop political donor to the Clintons as well as the Democratic Party,\u201d whose \u201cdonations to former President Bill Clinton were rewarded with a night in the prestigious Lincoln Bedroom.\u201d In 2013 Tsakopoulos, \u201cconfirmed that Hillary Clinton will seek the Democratic nomination in the next Presidential election.\u201d \\nAngelo\u2019s daughter Eleni, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Boxer , raised more than $1 million for Hillary Clinton in 2008 , and that money found its reward. On January 7, 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton swore in Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary. In that capacity , she condemned Wikileaks for releasing secret diplomatic cables, but declined comment on the authenticity of the material. Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis served as ambassador until 2013 but as Wikileaks confirms, she continued as a key Clinton supporter doing her best to beat back a presidential run by Joe Biden. \\nIn a June 11, 2015 email, Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis tells John Podesta that a Bay Area bagman \u201cswears Biden is running. He said he took him on Air Force Two, and he\u2019s getting emails.\u201d Last July, Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis emailed Clinton confidant Jake Sullivan that \u201cHRC indicated her view that it would be best to avoid Grexit\u201d and a July 9, 2015 email to Sullivan, John Podesta and Huma Abedin, she supports \u201cterms that will allow Greece to stay in the Eurozone.\u201d \\nOn October 11, 2015, Tsakopoulos Kounalakis emailed Podesta that \u201cthere is a Greek American love fest going on with Joe Biden, very boy-club.\u201d The same day she emailed Podesta and Huma Abedin that \u201cwe had a David Brock dinner with Annie Karni from Politico. She asked to use four quotes from me (see attached). I told her the first two could be with attribution, and the second two without.\u201d \\nAs the emails to John Podesta and Humba Abedin reveal, \u201cAmbassador Eleni Kounalakis,\u201d as she styles herself, remains part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s inner circle. Tellingly, the McClatchy-Tribune newspapers that run her husband\u2019s columns, do not acknowledge the strong Clinton connection. \\nThe New York Times proclaimed Kounalakis a \u201cWhite Knight\u201d for rescuing Washington Monthly , where he served as publisher and teamed with editor Paul Glastris. This tandem made the publication a \u201cprogressive must-read,\u201d according to Clinton strategist James Carville. Kounalakis reported for Newsweek in East Germany and ran their bureau in Prague. He also worked in Moscow for NBC Radio and Mutual news. \\nKounalakis\u2019 books include Hope Is a Tattered Flag: Voices for the Post-Bush Era , with Peter Laufer, and Beyond Spin: the Power of Strategic Corporate Journalism with Drew Banks and Kim Daus. It remains something of a mystery how the leftist Kounalakis became a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, known for strong conservative writers and scholars such as Thomas Sowell, Victor Davis Hanson, and Bruce Thornton. \\nOnly one time, as this writer recalls, has Kounalakis acknowledged in print his wife\u2019s strong Clinton connections. Even after the Wikileaks revelations, and with a presidential election only days away, Kounalakis did not acknowledge his wife\u2019s key role in HRC\u2019s inner circle with John Podesta and Huma Abedin. His October 30 Sacramento Bee piece suggests Markos is right at home in those circles. \\nKounalakis attacks \u201cthe Republican presidential nominee,\u201d implying that he is \u201ccrazy,\u201d and a tool of the evil Putin. On the other hand, the Clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy: \u201cAmerican society has made great strides in LGBTQ rights, women\u2019s rights and minority rights, and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy.\u201d \\nThe author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure Clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged Clinton crony. Maybe Markos will join his wife, Huma Abedin, and John Podesta in the Wikileaks revelations. For many observers, the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic. If Markos Kounalakis believes they are bogus, maybe he can write about what\u2019s in the real ones.'"}, "time": 1742563367.8855026}
