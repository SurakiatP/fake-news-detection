It was not clear if the gunman  \u2014   a man whose identity was not immediately known  \u2014   died of a   gunshot wound or had been shot by the police, Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said at a news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of trying to figure out why this happened and who this person is and what exactly made him snap,\u201d he said. The victim who was fatally shot was a man, but no details were immediately available about him. The two other victims, women ages 65 and 59, were in \u201creally critical\u201d condition, Lieutenant Corina said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them,\u201d he said. The episode, which unfolded around 2 p. m. in Azusa, a city about 25 miles east of Los Angeles, took several confusing and conflicting turns as the authorities tried to sort out what happened and to whom. The acting chief of the Azusa Police Department, Steve Hunt, had said at a news conference earlier on Tuesday that the person who did the shooting was a woman armed with a   rifle and that the dead victim was also a woman. Asked about the inconsistencies with earlier accounts, Lieutenant Corina said, \u201cWith something like this there are a lot of rumors flying around and a lot of misinformation going out. \u201d He added that \u201cso far we have found no evidence\u201d of an accomplice in the shooting but emphasized that the police were searching    for anyone else who might be injured, dead or hiding. The shooting unfolded as five Azusa police officers and one from nearby Irwindale responded to a report of gunfire on Fourth Street. Chief Hunt said that officers found \u201cmultiple victims\u201d and that as they were tending to them, the officers came under fire. They had to be extracted by armored vehicles. All of the officers who were pinned down by gunfire were \u201caccounted for, safe and rescued,\u201d the department said on Twitter. The gunman went back into a home and was barricaded there until tactical units entered the house and found him dead. Lieutenant Corina said that the police were obtaining a search warrant to look through the house. The victim who was fatally shot was lying in a doorway outside the home. What set off the shooting remained a mystery. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure it out ourselves,\u201d Lieutenant Corina said. After the shooting, two schools were locked down and two polling sites  \u2014   at Memorial Park and Dalton Elementary  \u2014   were closed, with Memorial Park shut for the rest of the day. \u201cVoters should avoid the area and, if necessary, cast a ballot at an alternate polling location,\u201d Dean Logan, the Los Angeles County   and county clerk, said on Twitter. The police said the shooting did not appear to have any connection to the polling sites or Election Day. Alfonso Mendez, 42, who lives in the neighborhood, said he saw two vehicles crash at the intersection of North Angeleno Avenue and Third Street. \u201cA big van and a white car were in an accident,\u201d Mr. Mendez said. He said an occupant \u201cran out of the car and started shooting at the cops. \u201d Chief Hunt said there was no pursuit by the police leading up to the shooting. The lieutenant said it was not clear how  \u2014   or if the crash  \u2014   was related to the shooting.'"}, "time": 1742562194.668519}
