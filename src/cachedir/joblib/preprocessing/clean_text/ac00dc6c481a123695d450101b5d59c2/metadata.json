Like an industrial engineer who also makes bespoke dueling pistols in his shed on the weekends, Mr. Wolfe has made a side career of skirmishing with the eminati (his term) in an array of cultural fields. If fighting enlivens one\u2019s mornings, Mr. Wolfe has had little need of caffeine. He took aim at Modern art and its enabling theorists in \u201cThe Painted Word\u201d (1975) and modern architecture and its critical druids in \u201cFrom Bauhaus to Our House\u201d (1981). In his essay \u201cStalking the   Beast\u201d (1989) he   the American literary establishment for its solipsistic retreat from realism. He referred to three of his antagonists  \u2014   John Updike, Norman Mailer and John Irving  \u2014   in the title of another essay, published in 2000, as \u201cMy Three Stooges. \u201d Mr. Wolfe\u2019s assaults were not meant to be well received by his entrenched opponents, and indeed they were not. He was tagged as an incorrigible philistine and worse. Few took his more combative books and essays altogether seriously, though they sharpened the conversation. Oddly, little of the stirred mud stuck to him. To recall these contretemps is to freshly appreciate Mr. Wolfe\u2019s cameo appearance in \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d when, after Homer smears chocolate on the author\u2019s trademark white suit, Mr. Wolfe yanks it off to reveal an identical clean one underneath. Mr. Wolfe, now 85, shows no sign of mellowing. His new book, \u201cThe Kingdom of Speech,\u201d is his boldest bit of dueling yet. It\u2019s a whooping,   and hyperbolic raid on, of all things, the theory of evolution, which he finds to be less scientific certainty than \u201ca messy guess  \u2014   baggy, boggy, soggy and leaking all over the place,\u201d to put it in the words he inserts into the mouths of past genetic theorists. Secondarily, this book is a rebuke of the work of the linguist Noam Chomsky, whom Mr. Wolfe refers to as \u201cNoam Charisma. \u201d Rebuke is actually too frivolous a word for the contumely Mr. Wolfe looses in his direction. More precisely, he tars and feathers Mr. Chomsky before sticking a clown nose on his face and rolling him in a baby stroller off a cliff. Mr. Wolfe does not complain about evolution on religious grounds in fact, he is an atheist. He begins by declaring the notion of the big bang to be vaguely ridiculous, and likens it to a mythopoetic bedtime story. Everything came from nothing? Most essentially, Mr. Wolfe employs new research from the controversial anthropologist Daniel Everett to argue that the power of speech  \u2014   man\u2019s signal attribute  \u2014   is not the product of evolution at all but rather a tool that man created. \u201cBango!\u201d Mr. Wolfe writes. \u201cThere is a cardinal distinction between man and animal. \u201d He wonders how airtight the theory of evolution can be if it does not account for such a thing. \u201cWhat is it,\u201d he asks, \u201cthat has left endless generations of academics, certified geniuses, utterly baffled when it comes to speech?\u201d Scientists will be likely to shrug at Mr. Wolfe\u2019s lucid if overexcited synthesis of other people\u2019s ideas and respond this way: We\u2019ll get there, in terms of sussing out speech, through the combined use of anatomy and physiology and biochemistry. The structures that support language don\u2019t fossilize, so evidence is simply harder to come by. This is not something we will lose sleep over, no matter how much you pogo and spit in the Sid Vicious manner. Mr. Chomsky, on the other hand, reading \u201cThe Kingdom of Speech,\u201d may lose a bit of sleep. Mr. Wolfe chronicles the arguments against two of that linguist\u2019s central theories  \u2014   the notion that humans are born with an unseen language organ in the brain, and the complicated structural concept of recursion in language  \u2014   and declares Mr. Chomsky to be bankrupt in nearly every regard, a pretentious man whose ideas set linguistic study back for decades. He narrates disputations of Mr. Chomsky\u2019s work as if they were prizefights: \u201cOOOF!  \u2014   right into the solar plexus!\u201d Mr. Wolfe seems especially incensed that as a scholar, Mr. Chomsky privileged mental work over fieldwork, making linguistics an indoor rather than an outdoor pursuit. (In this book\u2019s first section, Mr. Wolfe attacks Charles Darwin on similar grounds, paying almost no attention to the nearly five years Darwin spent aboard the Beagle.) These arguments neatly parallel his brief against American novelists whom, Mr. Wolfe thinks, don\u2019t get out of the house nearly enough. Because this is a Tom Wolfe production, there is a great deal of funny and acid commentary on social class. About the possibility that Darwin, a wealthy and connected British gentleman, might have plundered some of his ideas about evolution from Alfred Russel Wallace, a social nobody, he writes: \u201cThe British Gentleman was not merely rich, powerful, and refined. He was also a slick operator   \u2026     smooth   \u2026     smooth   \u2026     smooth and then some. It was said that a British Gentleman could steal your underwear, your smalls and skivvies and knickers, and leave you staring straight at him asking if he didn\u2019t think it had turned rather chilly all of a sudden. \u201d Because this is a Tom Wolfe production, a torrent of language is set free. Sentences spin past like whirligigs, or like Rube Goldberg devices that emit a pellet of information only after bouncing off four increasingly unlikely surfaces. Mr. Wolfe\u2019s prose here is mostly   but there are moments when he seems on the verge of losing it, of falling into fragments of   nonsense that will put older readers in mind of the insane   columns Larry King once filed for USA Today. Here is Mr. Wolfe, for example, on the work of eight evolutionists he wishes to mock: \u201cI surfed and Safaried and finally moused upon the only academic I could find who disagreed with the eight failures, a chemist at Rice University   \u2026     Rice   \u2026     Rice used to have a   football team   \u2026     the Rice Owls   \u2026     wonder how they\u2019re doing now? I moused around on the Rice site some more, and     \u2026     not so great last season, the Owls   \u2026     football   \u2026     and I surfed to football concussions   \u2026     exactly as I thought!\u201d The   system in his cranium, here and elsewhere, has gone haywire. \u201cThe Kingdom of Speech\u201d is meant to be a provocation rather than a dissertation. The sound it makes is that of a lively mind having a very good time, and enjoying the scent of its own   napalm in the morning.'"}, "time": 1742562439.9075327}
