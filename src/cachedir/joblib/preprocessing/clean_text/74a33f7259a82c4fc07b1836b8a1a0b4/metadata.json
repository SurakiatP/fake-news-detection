Donald J. Trump attributed a nonexistent increase in murder to actions that never happened, namely, the ending of the    practice by, variously, \u201ca judge, who was a very   judge,\u201d and the \u201ccurrent mayor. \u201d This was multilayered fiction. Murder declined. A judge did not end   . Neither did the current mayor. In fact, the Police Department began to drastically curtail its use in 2012, under the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent. This is well documented but only lightly noticed. On July 9, 2012, an editorial in The New York Post warned that the reduction in its use would lead to \u201cmore blood in the street. \u201d By the way, did more blood run in the street? No, less blood did. Murder is down 32 percent since 2011, the last year of the old    era, having dropped to 352 homicides in 2015 from 515 in 2011. In the same period, stops were down by about 97 percent, said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the department. During the debate, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, alluded to a few of these numbers. Mr. Trump, her Republican opponent, started shouting. \u201cUnder the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there is  \u2014   \u2014  \u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Mr. Trump interjected. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. \u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cMurders are up, all right,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou check it. \u201d All right, as Mr. Trump said, let\u2019s check it. A Google search for \u201cHistorical New York City Crime Data\u201d will bring you to a site with charts of serious felonies. Frisks went down. So has murder, a steady decline that has continued, with slight annual variations, through this year. In the     used by Mr. Trump, those details land upside down. Also, he repeated a more common mistake about the decline of the    tactics, attributing it to a federal judge hearing a   lawsuit against the city, and to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, who succeeded Mr. Bloomberg in 2014. \u201cIt was terminated by the current mayor,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Actually, no. Last year, the city police conducted 22, 939 stops, or about 63 a day. So    was not terminated by Mr. de Blasio, or by anyone else for that matter. It\u2019s true that the use of the tactic has declined. During the mayoralty of Mr. Bloomberg, the number of reported stops skyrocketed, but then was scaled back as the city faced pressure from the   litigation, brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights. By the end of 2013, the year Shira A. Scheindlin, the federal judge hearing the case, ruled that the city\u2019s wholesale search practices violated the Constitution, the number of stops had declined by 72 percent from its peak in 2011. \u201cBut    had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the debate. \u201cTremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. \u201d During the era praised by Mr. Trump, about 90 percent of the people who were stopped were young black or Latino men who had committed no crime whatsoever, according to police data. Of those few who were arrested, the vast majority were charged with nothing more serious than possession of marijuana, not having guns. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people were being stopped every year so that the city could arrest tens of thousands for having weed. Applied almost exclusively to minorities, the    tactics in New York became an elephantine government project that wasted time and money, degrading both to the personhood of the men and women who were stopped and to the professionalism of the people doing the stopping. It was poor social hygiene, not defensible as a matter of law or as effective law and order. As Mr. Trump said, it was \u201ctremendous beyond belief. \u201d Just so.'"}, "time": 1742564074.9403868}
