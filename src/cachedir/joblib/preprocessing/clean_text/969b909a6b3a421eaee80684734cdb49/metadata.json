We may never know for sure whether he took an ounce of unmitigated pleasure in any of it. Notoriously   compulsively   \u201che was never truly comfortable unless he was seething with unhappiness at something. \u201d That\u2019s how one of his veteran jokesmiths describes him in Jason Zinoman\u2019s \u201cLetterman: The Last Giant of Late Night,\u201d a book that does impressive triple duty as an acute portrait of stardom, an insightful chronicle of three rambunctious decades of   evolution, and a very brainy fan\u2019s notes. Suggestive as it is of rage, not just a chronic case of the Eeyore blues, the striking word \u201cseething\u201d is a useful window into Letterman\u2019s uniqueness. Has \u201cThe Tonight Show\u2019s\u201d current host, Jimmy Fallon, ever seethed with anything, unless one can seethe with puerility? For that matter, neither does Colbert, who stays psychologically tranquil even at his most morally indignant. Only Letterman, once TV\u2019s leading advocate for cynically   shallowness, corresponds to   notions of the existentially profound. It\u2019s fair to say we got snookered. Early on, when \u201cLate Night With David Letterman\u201d defined his snark as the ideally frivolous antidote to the Reagan era\u2019s cant, he passed himself off as, and possibly even was, a glib Hoosier wiseacre with no use for earnestness except as fodder for parody. His brand of ridicule was too reflexive to be concerned with whether or not its targets were deserving. The reason that callous streak seldom mattered was that he also never stopped insisting on his own (and TV\u2019s) triviality. But beginning in \u201cLate Night\u2019s\u201d later years, he developed  \u2014   unless the right word is \u201ccurdled\u201d  \u2014   into the crotchety main attraction of an eccentric, ever more   psychodrama. It was as if he felt irresistibly goaded to turn Samuel Beckett\u2019s \u201cKrapp\u2019s Last Tape\u201d into thousands of hours of videotape. Of all the unlikely outcomes, he was suddenly the most authentic personality on television. This arc says a great deal about not only Letterman himself, but his once impish, now grizzled generation\u2019s shifting role in American life. Linking both is TV\u2019s ascent from the potluck, more or less disreputable mass entertainment it still was in the early 1980s to our primary cultural  \u2014   and, thanks to cable, artistic  \u2014   arena, at least for a while. Well before Letterman\u2019s retirement, social media had transformed the landscape all over again, and Fallon was the one who understood the uses of Twitter. Zinoman, who is this newspaper\u2019s comedy reviewer, seems to have all those dimensions at his fingertips. However, he\u2019s too lively a writer to get bogged down in   theorizing. His   commentary is so compressed and fluid that you often scarcely notice how casually he\u2019s able to switch from micro to macro and back inside a single paragraph. As celebrity biographers go, he\u2019s humane but not easily fooled (Zinoman interviewed Letterman, as well as many others associated with his shows). As a critic, he\u2019s especially sharp and engaging when he\u2019s breaking down Letterman\u2019s trademark predilections, from the goofball love of peculiar locutions and nonsensically stressed clich\u00e9s that evoked a sort of demented   to how unerringly \u201chis comedic instinct was to mock and belittle whatever world he inhabited. \u201d The latter impulse stayed constant even when the primary world Letterman inhabited on \u201cLate Show\u201d was his own curmudgeonly, dissatisfied brain. But it also predated his fame. As early as middle school, he was equating   with media constructs, enlisting a classmate to stage sham talk shows on a mock set in the friend\u2019s basement. (Shades of Rupert Pupkin in \u201cThe King of Comedy. \u201d) By the time he got to college at Ball State University in Indiana, though, his invariable M. O. as a   disc jockey was to burlesque the conventions   pretensions of whatever format he was assigned, including introducing Debussy\u2019s \u201cClair de Lune\u201d with a breezy \u201cYou know the de Lune sisters. There was Claire, there was Mabel. \u201d That particular bit of irreverence promptly got him canned, though not for long. Then followed a few scruffy years on local TV, including his celebrated stint as a   weatherman, before he nerved himself to head to Los Angeles in 1975. Once there, he did   at the Comedy Store, appeared on game shows, shot a failed pilot for one of his own, and spent a few unhappy weeks on Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s flop variety series, \u201cMary. \u201d Then he got booked on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d at a time when Johnny Carson\u2019s benediction was pure gold. Letterman\u2019s own \u201cThe David Letterman Show\u201d debuted on NBC in 1980, and though it didn\u2019t last long  \u2014   the morning time slot was all wrong for him  \u2014   it provided the template for everything he was to do in late night. By then, he\u2019d already found an invaluable accomplice: the writer and comedian Merrill Markoe, his girlfriend for the better part of a decade and the decisive creative influence on both \u201cThe David Letterman Show\u201d and \u201cLate Night. \u201d (\u201cWithout her, you and I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here,\u201d Letterman told an interviewer after their breakup.) But Zinoman gives almost equal credit to the veteran director Hal Gurnee, who grasped right away that television wasn\u2019t only Letterman\u2019s medium it was his subject. Now that \u201cmeta\u201d is the conceptual given of so much TV comedy, it\u2019s easy to forget how inventive Gurnee\u2019s visual equivalents of putting everything inside air quotes actually were. The same is true of Letterman\u2019s longtime musical sidekick, Paul Shaffer, whose parody version of Vegas smarm defined \u201cLate Night\u201d as pure showbiz and pure   simultaneously. Zinoman isn\u2019t wrong to spend over twice as many pages on Letterman\u2019s \u201cLate Night\u201d years  \u2014   lasting just over a decade, from 1982 to 1993  \u2014   as his much longer stint hosting \u201cLate Show\u201d ( ). After all, \u201cLate Night\u201d arguably changed the face of television, while its much plusher CBS sequel mostly just changed the face of its host. Not always for the better, either as Zinoman observes, \u201cLetterman increasingly played the horny creep\u201d with female guests as he aged. He got a comeuppance of sorts when a 2009 blackmail threat forced him to   admit he\u2019d cheated on his wife with more than one of the show\u2019s staffers. By then, however, he was such a famously odd duck that Steve Martin congratulated him on the air for humanizing himself. Interestingly, even on \u201cLate Night,\u201d Letterman had much less investment in staying quirkily   than his writers did, particularly once alumni of The Harvard Lampoon and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d began dominating the writers\u2019 room and pushing for more audacity. Emulating and eventually succeeding Johnny Carson remained his goal, one he fell short of once Jay Leno inherited \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d instead. Despite Zinoman\u2019s Generation X birth date, he knows his television history well enough to argue that Letterman was as much a throwback to midcentury TV as a postmodern iconoclast, modulating from Steve Allen\u2019s style (waggish, superior and happily ridiculous) to Jack Paar\u2019s (neurotic, confessional, tormented). Yet Letterman\u2019s true originality may be that only a Midwestern boomer who was every bit as easily unnerved as he was nervy could have combined the two. Or, at any rate, turned them into chapters of the same generational odyssey.'"}, "time": 1742628539.500816}
