The 1986 law, the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, has been repeatedly described as vague and ineffectual \u2014 allowing overzealous prosecutors to saddle hacktivists and low-level criminals with excessive sentences. \\nNow, thanks to a legal challenge to the CFAA, the Department of Justice is for the first time releasing its 2014 guidelines on how prosecutors should charge computer crimes \u2014 when someone exceeds \u201cauthorized\u201d access on a computer. (First Look Media, the publisher of The Intercept, is a plaintiff in the case.) \\nThe Department of Justice acknowledges that \u201claws addressing the misuse of computers have not kept pace uniformly with developments in technology and criminal schemes\u201d though it maintains that the law remains \u201cimportant\u201d in prosecuting cybercrimes. \\nSome of the prosecutions under the CFAA have proved controversial. Aaron Swartz, a well-known internet activist who downloaded academic journals en masse, faced years of grueling legal trials under the CFAA before he committed suicide. And Andrew Auernheimer was found guilty of conspiracy to violate the CFAA by uncovering AT&T customer data exposed on the company website.'"}, "time": 1742628408.0277228}
