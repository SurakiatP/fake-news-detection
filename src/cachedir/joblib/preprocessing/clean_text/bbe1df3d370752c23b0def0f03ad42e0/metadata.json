The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a \u201ccatastrophe. \u201d Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck.   \u2026     In a matter of weeks, President Trump has taken dozens of   steps that, if they are not reversed, will rip families apart, foul rivers and pollute the air, intensify the calamitous effects of climate change and profoundly weaken the system of American public education for all.   \u2026     What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself. He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind   so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. His obsession with his own fame, wealth and success, his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined, his craving for adulation  \u2014   these traits were, of course, at the very heart of his   outsider campaign indeed, some of them helped get him elected. But in a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power, they are nothing short of disastrous. The editorial comes just days after Trump\u2019s \u201cunimaginable power\u201d proved unable to force through a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. There were few, if any, Times editorials criticizing President Barack Obama\u2019s narcissism and expansion of executive powers (after promising to curtail the same). Read the whole editorial here.
