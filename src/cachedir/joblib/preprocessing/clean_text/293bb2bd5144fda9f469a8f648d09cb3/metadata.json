President Donald Trump by casting a \u201cbinding spell\u201d to prevent him from governing. [The \u201cmass spell to bind Donald Trump\u201d will be performed at midnight on every waning crescent moon beginning Friday, February 24, \u201cuntil Donald Trump is removed from office,\u201d the group\u2019s website states.  The mass ritual will allegedly be repeated again March 26, April 24, May 23, June 21 (the summer solstice) July 21, and August 19. The spell also invokes evil on \u201cthose who abet\u201d Trump, which would seem to appear to cover his staff and political nominees, and perhaps the millions who voted for him as well.  The spell involves such items as an unflattering photo of Trump, a tower tarot card, a tiny stub of an orange candle, a pin or small nail, water, salt, a feather and an ashtray. \u201cThis binding spell is open source, and may be modified to fit your preferred spiritual practice or magical system,\u201d the site explains. What is critical is \u201cthe simultaneity of the working\u201d as well as \u201cthe mass energy of participants. \u201d \u201cSome   are doing a variation of this as a group working, while a number of solitary practitioners are planning to connect and livestream via Facebook, Twitter, and other social media,\u201d the site explains. In reaction, a number of Christian groups and individuals have promised to pray for Mr. Trump, asking God\u2019s blessings on his work and on the nation. Witches cast spells tomorrow, We  &gtNo weapon formed against you shall prosper . @POTUSAmerica\u2019s praying for you @VP #Pray4DJT \u2764\ufe0f pic. twitter.   \u2014   \u2764\ufe0fMAGAMama\u2764\ufe0f (@tteegar) February 24, 2017,  The witches\u2019 spell involves a lengthy incantation, calling on spirits and \u201cdemons of the infernal realms\u201d to bind Donald J. Trump so that \u201che may fail utterly, that he may do no harm. \u201d Calling on the spirits to work the same harm on \u201call those who enable his wickedness and those whose mouths speak his poisonous lies,\u201d the hex beseeches the spirits to \u201cbind them in chains, bind their tongues, bind their works, bind their wickedness. \u201d The climax of the spell involves a crescendo \u201cwith increasing passion\u201d ending by blowing out the orange candle while \u201cvisualizing Trump blowing apart into dust or ash. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
