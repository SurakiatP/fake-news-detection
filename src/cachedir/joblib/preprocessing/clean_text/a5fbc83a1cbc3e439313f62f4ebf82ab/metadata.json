And while most of the international forces with an interest in Syria are keen to exclusively blame one side or the other, civilians in both sides\u2019 neighborhoods are being killed. \\nRussia has paused their airstrikes against Aleppo over the past couple of weeks, though an escalation in fighting further west has meant civilian casualties have continued, with reports of chlorine gas attacks by Nusra forces against government-held areas.
