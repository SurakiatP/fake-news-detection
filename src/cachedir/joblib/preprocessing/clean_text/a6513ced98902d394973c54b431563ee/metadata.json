When the designer Tomas Maier needed a coffee table, he went there, too, and plunked down his credit card for a safety glass and   coffee table from Joe D\u2019Urso. And when the Hollywood agent Bryan Lourd was in search of a new lounge chair, he picked out a black leather Papa Bear by Hans Wegner, also from Wyeth. With its   prices and enormous selection of Danish modernist pieces, the store is arguably the premiere   emporium in the United States. Its owner, John Birch, is also one of the most elusive, and talked about, dealers on the   furniture scene: a Larry Gagosian for the   set, with strong taste that did not just mirror the market but helped set it. Mr. Birch  \u2014   a trim,      with   eyes and salt and pepper spackled hair  \u2014   hobnobs with the Olsen twins (who featured an assortment of his furniture at the most recent presentation of their line, the Row) introduced Helmut Lang to his assortment of Wegner furniture and has recently been giving Jimmy Fallon advice on his Gramercy Park home. Sleek bamboo dining tables designed by Mr. Birch have become status objects owned by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and the entertainment manager turned real estate mogul Sandy Gallin. Mr. Birch\u2019s girlfriend, Tiffany Vassilakis, is an accomplished interior designer who has worked with Carey Lowell and Richard Gere. Next Tuesday, Mr. Birch is expanding his footprint with a Sotheby\u2019s auction of rare midcentury finds that could fetch upward of $1. 8 million. Later this month, he\u2019s opening a    showroom on the ground floor of 533 Canal Street that\u2019s a triumph of Wyethesque minimalism: exposed white brick walls, perfectly sanded cement floors, light fixtures from O. C. White and Isamu Noguchi, and a floating raw steel staircase  \u2014   its 23 steps fabricated by hand and welded on site by Mr. Birch. Yet as movers came in and out on a recent afternoon, and a team from Sotheby\u2019s prepared to photograph pieces for the catalog, Mr. Birch looked less like a furniture mogul than a boy whose toys were being taken away from him. He didn\u2019t like having to move a prized George Nakashima coffee table (estimate: $20, 000 to $30, 000) out of the shot. And he didn\u2019t like that a mosaic coffee table by Vladimir Kagan ($8, 000 to $12, 000) and Cippolino marble coffee table by Poul Kjaerholm ($7, 000 to $9, 000) had nothing on them. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the empty tables,\u201d he said, peering around the room. \u201cNothing\u2019s ever empty at Wyeth. \u201d A bulb in one of Noguchi ceiling lanterns had gone out and was becoming a source of real irritation. \u201cI\u2019m glad I have employees who realize the bulb has been blown out for two weeks,\u201d he said sarcastically, climbing on top of a Hans Wegner desk so he could replace it himself. As can be surmised, Mr. Birch is a    sort of guy. He\u2019s not mean, although he says so little and charges so much for things that people often presume he must be. But he is painstaking, meticulous and so focused on achieving a kind of aesthetic perfection that he can drive himself (and everyone around him) crazy. And in recent months, it\u2019s not just neurosis keeping him up at night. The wealthy Brazilians who used to stream through his doors are largely gone, as their economy implodes and their president, Dilma Rousseff, awaits an impeachment trial. Gone, too, are the Brunello   hedge funders, who, as the art market shows evidence of a possible correction, are clearly less inclined to pay $50, 000 for a pair of Finn Juhl\u2019s chieftain chairs. And then there\u2019s 1stdibs. Once exclusive, the online site featuring modern and antique furniture, jewelry, fine art and other collectibles, has been ferociously signing up dealers who, as he puts it, \u201cwork out of storage lockers\u201d in places like suburban Illinois with low rents, and don\u2019t bother with the painstaking restoration for which Wyeth is known. The site is also increasingly aggressive about collecting commissions on the online sales, a practice Mr. Birch sees as  . Many of his Manhattan colleagues are already downsizing or folding up shop. Todd Merrill packed up his mirrored Paul Evans pieces and left Bleecker Street this winter for a location in the slightly more affordable financial district. In the fall, Alan Moss, the Art Deco purveyor, will close his Lafayette Street store and go online only. \u201cIt\u2019s a last stand,\u201d Mr. Birch said, reflecting on the current state of the   furniture market. \u201cRetail is a terrible business. \u201d In fact, he sees his new showroom as a way of weaning himself away from 1stdibs. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to do with them anymore,\u201d he said. But how did it come to this, that one of the country\u2019s leading purveyors of midcentury modern design should find himself in retrenchment, just as the market finds a wider audience thanks to sites like 1stdibs, not to mention knockoff manufacturers that hawk cheap imitations? John Birch (no relation to the Baptist minister who has a   group named after him) was born in Brigham City, Utah, the oldest boy in a Mormon family of nine children. \u201cWith only one mother!\u201d joked his younger brother Paul, who as Wyeth\u2019s principal woodworker builds many of the original pieces and oversees restoration of vintage finds. In the early 1980s, after attending Brigham Young University for a semester (\u201cmaybe half,\u201d he said) Mr. Birch arrived in New York City, fell into the fashion business, and spent a decade bouncing around the display departments of Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Giorgio Armani. \u201cHe had an incredible eye and very defined taste,\u201d said Gabriella Forte, who was his boss at Armani before becoming president at Calvin Klein and then chief executive of David Yurman. \u201cHe positions things with real talent. It\u2019s pure simplicity. Is it minimalism? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how I\u2019d describe it. It was just perfection. \u201d By 1994, Mr. Birch had had enough. So he leased a    space on Franklin Street in TriBeCa, named it for his then    son, Wyeth, and filled it with his favorite things. (Wyeth graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design last year and now works for the family business. Mr. Birch and Wyeth\u2019s mother, Daphne, separated over a decade ago, though they never divorced. \u201cIt\u2019s cordial,\u201d Mr. Birch said.) Back then, TriBeCa was still in its infancy. Nobu had just opened and the majority of big antiques dealers had fairly narrow specialties like Biedermeier and Art Deco, which befit an earlier, fussier era. The novelty of Wyeth, said Robin Standefer, half of the design team Roman and Williams, was how Mr. Birch mixed things up, placing postwar Danish chairs with     gas light fixtures and   coffee tables from the \u201980s. \u201cHe would take objects that were somehow considered less valuable, that didn\u2019t necessarily have pedigree, and reassemble them in unexpected ways,\u201d Ms. Standefer said. \u201cHe certainly educated American consumers to a kind of Danish design. But what I found most interesting is what he paired those things with. That\u2019s what was different. That\u2019s what was unusual. \u201d Soon, word spread about the   Mormon who talked little to his customers and charged a fortune for the coolest stuff in town. Ms. Standefer brought Ms. Paltrow, who bought pieces like $3, 000 lamps and the company\u2019s $16, 000 bamboo dining table. When Ms. Paltrow started dating Ben Affleck, he also began shopping at the store. So did Andr\u00e9 Balazs, Richard Gere, Julianne Moore, Ben Stiller, Meg Ryan and David Bowie. Around that time, a woman with long blond hair began coming in regularly without ever saying hello or goodbye. \u201cAfter five visits, she handed over her credit card,\u201d Mr. Birch said. \u201cIt was Annie Leibovitz. \u201d Many of his famous customers did not even get discounts or a friendly smile. \u201cHe was not a pleasure to buy from,\u201d Diane von Furstenberg said. \u201cHe really wasn\u2019t. \u201d But instead of walking away, she (like many others) became a repeat customer, part of an elite circle that kept coming back even as they complained about the store\u2019s outrageous prices and the way its owner barely seemed to grunt in their direction. As with most myths, the legend may not have been totally in sync with reality. Mr. Birch, it turns out, is actually shy, the sort of person who is more comfortable with beautiful things than beautiful people. And those that did try negotiating often got a bargain, particularly when he sensed a fellow design worshiper. Still, his untraditional approach to salesmanship had a reverse playback among a subset of people used to being doted upon: His lack of solicitousness made customers desperate to buy from him. \u201cPart of his mystique was that he was elusive,\u201d said Wendy Goodman, the design editor of New York Magazine. \u201cWhen you went in and had an audience with him, it was a big thing. Because it was a question: \u2018Were you worth it? \u2019\u201d That\u2019s more or less how Jessica Seinfeld, another person who came to Wyeth over the years, described the experience of shopping there. \u201cTheir taste is impeccable,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery piece in their shop is \u2018important\u2019 in one way or another, so I respect their consistency, even their condescension. I find myself charmed by their lack of interest in human contact. \u201d Wyeth did go through rough patches, which often coincided with its expansion. It moved out of Franklin Street and into its current    home on Spring Street around the September 2001 attacks. And it opened a space in Sagaponack, N. Y. in 2008, just after the financial crisis hit. Casual customers presumed that Mr. Birch cared only about selling things at the highest price, but as Wyeth\u2019s trove grew and grew, a different theory emerged among those who knew him best. Mr. Birch, they said, could not bear to be separated from his favorite things, so he began pricing them as high as possible so they wouldn\u2019t sell. \u201cHe\u2019s putting together a continuum of a design aesthetic, and to do that, he needs to own these things, touch them and feel them,\u201d said Richard Barrett, his friend and landlord at 533 Canal. \u201cSome might say he\u2019s a hoarder. \u201d Mr. Birch didn\u2019t exactly deny the thesis. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I was never focused on money,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even get sales reports. I don\u2019t ask for them. \u201d His idiosyncratic approach to business also extended to the new Canal Street store. When Mr. Birch first agreed to rent that space around 2008, he thought it would become a third Wyeth outpost, focused largely on his new productions. Then, renovations took years, as Mr. Birch slaved over every detail, while the market for midcentury modern furniture became more transparent and democratic, thanks both to 1stdibs and to Restoration Hardware, which recently introduced a modern collection of   tables called the Wythe collection. \u201cIt was hilarious,\u201d Mr. Barrett said. \u201cEven the typeface looked like Wyeth. \u201d (Restoration Hardware did not respond to a request for comment.) \u201cWhen you educate people too well, which in a sense is what he did, they discover ways to sleuth the same objects,\u201d said Ms. Standefer of Roman and Williams. That   market led Mr. Birch to call Sotheby\u2019s this winter, and people there were happy to help Mr. Birch divest of what they viewed to be one of the best modern design collections in the world. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few sales I\u2019ve conducted in my career where I wanted to buy half the things in it,\u201d said Jodi Pollack, the auction house\u2019s head of 20th century design. Perhaps predictably, Mr. Birch worked all the way to the wire, fussing over every imaginable detail the last furniture shipments arrived at the Canal Street showroom mere minutes before a party there on May 17 celebrating its opening and the coming Sotheby\u2019s sale.   aficionados and fellow dealers began arriving around 7 p. m. streaming into a room of Kjaerholm tables, Finn Juhl chairs and new biomorphic,   mirrors by Mr. Birch. Longtime customers remarked on the high auction prices (including two Wegner easy chairs expected to fetch $60, 000 to $80, 000 each) while tattooed staffers told stories about the poor Sotheby\u2019s photographer tasked with getting Mr. Birch\u2019s portrait (he wouldn\u2019t sit still, kept rearranging the furniture and smoked the entire time). True to form, Mr. Birch was hard to find. Wearing a pair of RRL jeans, a charcoal Comme des Gar\u00e7ons sweater and a dark Jil Sander blazer, he huddled in the back with the Olsen twins. They made a fitting trio, this reclusive   character and two women whose public personas have been built largely upon doing lots and saying little. But it was impossible to know what they were talking about because   Olsen quickly shut a reporter down. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving any interviews. \u201d Nearby was Mr. Birch\u2019s son Wyeth. \u201cIn my family, we don\u2019t often express our appreciation for each other,\u201d Wyeth said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put it because right now, I\u2019m exhausted. But this is the first time in my adult life we\u2019ve celebrated Wyeth. It\u2019s tough love with my dad. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562096.0737002}
