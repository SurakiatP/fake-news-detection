But he has lost credibility that he may never regain. The Brady case  \u2014   his role in improperly deflated footballs  \u2014   seemed silly at first. But this molehill became a mountain that the N. F. L. was willing to die on to protect its shield. The case has been a winding road to the truth since January 2015, after the Patriots\u2019 lopsided victory over Indianapolis in the A. F. C. championship game. The most extraordinary evidence against Brady was the Wells report, which suggested that Brady did not always play by the rules when it came to using properly inflated footballs. Based on the report, Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Brady for four   games. The Patriots were also fined $1 million and lost a couple of draft picks, including this year\u2019s No. 1. Brady argued that he was unfairly suspended. Last July, Brady\u2019s suspension was upheld by Goodell. Last September, Judge Richard M. Berman said Goodell administered \u201chis own brand of industrial justice\u201c and overturned Goodell\u2019s ruling. That decision allowed Brady to play the entire season, a season he used as a revenge tour and one that New England fans turned into a football holy war. Monday\u2019s ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ripped apart every shred of Berman\u2019s decision. It reaffirmed Goodell\u2019s broad authority to administer discipline as he pleases and it affirmed his power. This is power that the N. F. L. Players Association willingly gave up during the last collective bargaining agreement. Players who challenged Goodell\u2019s authority  \u2014   Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy  \u2014   were emboldened by what they perceived as a crack in Goodell\u2019s armor. They challenged his authority with lawsuits. But Monday\u2019s decision was loud and clear: Goodell has the hammer again and is willing to drop it. I am all for resisting and challenging authority. But the deflation scandal was never a noble cause. Brady was caught cheating and was uncooperative, having his phone destroyed around the time league investigators wanted access to it. \u201cI would say this goes beyond power I think it\u2019s really about order,\u201d Katz said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a league unless somebody has the authority to make decisions. Otherwise you have disorder, you have chaos. \u201d It\u2019s about order and Brady\u2019s stature. Celebrity may have gotten Brady a favorable decision from Berman, but it was ultimately not enough to keep him from being suspended. \u201dIf this case had been brought by a journeyman quarterback, he would not have gotten beyond the   line,\u201d Katz said. He added: \u201cThe only reason it got as far as it did was because it was Tom Brady. We have a   society, but when you get to court, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a celebrity. \u201d After two years of missteps, Goodell is on a roll. Earlier this month, a court of appeals upheld a Federal District Court judge\u2019s decision approving the N. F. L. concussion settlement agreement. Linda S. Greene, the   law professor at the University of Wisconsin, draws a sharp distinction between how Goodell successfully handled the Brady case and how he mishandled the Ray Rice investigation, protecting a star player and his team in a clear case of domestic abuse. \u201cThis is a win for the commissioner,\u201d Greene said, \u201cbut unlike in the Ray Rice case, where the decision was the byproduct of a commissioner who looked the other way at Rice\u2019s egregious conduct, the Brady suspension was the product of a thorough investigation, a lengthy hearing over which the commissioner presided. \u201d The union released a statement on Monday. It was disappointed by the ruling, adding that it would \u201ccarefully review the decision, consider all of our options and continue to fight for players\u2019 rights and for the integrity of the game. \u201d Katz said, \u201cThey negotiated this agreement where the commissioner had this power, and that\u2019s the way it should have proceeded. \u201d The union should stop the fight for Brady. Brady\u2019s team of legal advisers should tell him to accept the decision. The court\u2019s   decision can be appealed to the full Second Circuit Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Supreme Court will have any interest in this whatsoever,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIt\u2019s done. \u201d Brady should take the sack and let the sport he has soiled have its vindication.'"}, "time": 1742564486.1005027}
