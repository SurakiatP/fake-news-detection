[Warmbier, 22, died Monday following his release from North Korean custody last week. He had traveled to Pyongyang with Young Pioneer Tours and stood accused of attempting to steal a communist propaganda poster from his hotel.  In a March 2016 hostage video, Warmbier \u201cconfessed\u201d to the crime and claimed that the U. S. government had bribed him to tamper with the poster. In that confession, he also thanked North Korea for its \u201chumanitarian\u201d treatment of a \u201csevere criminal\u201d like him. In a blog post on its website, Young Pioneer Tours announced, \u201cWe will no longer be organising tours for US citizens to North Korea. \u201d \u201cThe devastating loss of Otto Warmbier\u2019s life has led us to reconsider our position on accepting American tourists. There had not been any previous detainment in North Korea that has ended with such tragic finality and we have been struggling to process the result,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cNow, the assessment of risk for Americans visiting North Korea has become too high. \u201d While the group condemns the \u201cway\u201d that North Korea handled the detention as \u201cappalling\u201d and a \u201ctragedy,\u201d it does not condemn the North Korean regime for arresting Warmbier in the first place or for its record of detaining Americans to be used as diplomatic bargaining chips. The company also claims that it made \u201cconstant requests\u201d to North Korean officials for information on Warmbier but was told only that \u201che was fine. \u201d Warmbier arrived in the United States last week with \u201cextensive brain damage\u201d according to American doctors that cared for him in Ohio before his death. North Korean officials claimed that he had been in a coma for about a year after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill, but American doctors said they saw no evidence of botulism. Warmbier\u2019s father, Fred, attacked Young Pioneer Tours and its ilk in the press conference he hosted last week, following Otto Warmbier\u2019s return to Ohio. \u201cThe North Koreans lure Americans to travel to North Korea via tour groups, run out of China, who advertise slick ads on the internet proclaiming, \u2018No American ever gets detained on our tours\u2019 and \u2018This is a safe place to go,\u2019\u201d he explained. At the time, the New York Times reported, the Young Pioneers website read that being American was \u201cnot at all\u201d a problem in traveling to North Korea, despite U. S. State Department warnings against such travel. Since the change in policy this morning, the site notes that it will not accept American travelers on its North Korea trips. Other than that minor change, the group\u2019s misleading portrayal of North Korea, clearly designed to appeal to impressionable youth, remains on the site. \u201cDespite what you may hear, for most nationalities, North Korea is probably one of the safest places on Earth to visit provided you follow the laws as provided by our documentation and   briefings,\u201d the website claims. It applauds North Korea\u2019s not allowing foreigners to go anywhere in the country without a communist chaperone because it \u201cadds to the mysticism of the country. \u201d It warns tourists not to speak too much during the trip: \u201cIf you\u2019re quiet and listen you\u2019ll be surprised just how much you can learn. \u201d Young Pioneers also still boasts \u201cbudget tours to destinations your mother wants you to stay away from\u201d and a blog replete with praise for a dizzying array of oppressive regimes ranging from Cuba (\u201cWe\u2019re taking you to Cuba this December for our annual Che Guevara Revolutionary Tour! \u201d) to Myanmar (\u201cOne of the most special and unique travel experiences, due to its stunning geography, rich and varied culture and warm, proud people\u201d) and China (\u201cOnce in a lifetime Maoist adventure\u201d). Young Pioneers, named after the communist equivalent to the Hitler Youth, calls itself \u201ca company that craves communist kitsch. \u201d Its founder, British   Gareth Johnson, writes in his biography that his \u201c  love for the people and culture of the DPRK\u201d led him to establish the group and praises North Korea\u2019s \u201cgreat, plentiful, and cheap!\u201d seafood. At least one American, Amanda Moore, is listed as an official in the company. While the company is in the public eye for leading Warmbier to his death, Young Pioneers is not the only group preying on the curiosity of young Westerners with North Korea trips. One tour group, the Koryo Group, also claims on its website that North Korea is \u201cprobably one of the safest countries in the world for a tourist. \u201d New Korea Tours promises \u201ca tour of communism which starts with the 1950\u2019s reconstruction.   \u2026     Every tourist who has traveled with us has said it has been one of the highlights in their world travels. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562154.4046605}
