Native Americans maintain a spiritual tradition with bison , believing that as long as buffalo \u2014 a gift from the Great Spirit \u2014 roam free and as long as the herds are bountiful, the sovereignty of indigenous people would remain strong. \\nAnd in the midst of mass arrests, mace attacks, and beatings from batons, a stampede of bison suddenly appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp. A cry of joy reportedly erupted from the Standing Rock Sioux, as they had been praying for assistance from the Tatanka Oyate during their standoff with riot police and national guardsmen. \\nOkay here you go\u2026 it is a beautiful thing\u2026 WATCH. The Tatanka (Pte) Oyate Buffalo Nation stands with Standing Rock\u2026 \\nPosted by Walt Pourier on Thursday, October 27, 2016 \\nAs the police response to the Sioux\u2019s ongoing nonviolent civil disobedience escalates, tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and stop the mistreatment of the indigenous community. \\n\u201cWe call on the state of North Dakota to oversee the actions of local law enforcement to, first and foremost, ensure everyone\u2019s safety. The Department of Justice must send overseers immediately to ensure the protection of First Amendment rights and the safety of thousands here at Standing Rock,\u201d wrote David Archambault II , chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. \u201cDOJ can no longer ignore our requests.\u201d \\n\\nTom Cahill is a writer for US Uncut based in the Pacific Northwest.
