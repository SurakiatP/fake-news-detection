It is managed by our Editorial Board Russian battle group reaches Mediterranean after \u2018causing stir\u2019 in the West (VIDEO) By GPD on November 1, 2016 The nuclear-powered heavy cruiser Peter the Great. \u00a9 Dover-Marina.com / Sputnik A Russian naval group, headed by the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier and the battle cruiser Peter the Great, has made its way into the Mediterranean, causing quite a stir in the West, the Russian Defense Ministry said. \\nMoscow has been surprised by the countries that have denied Russia\u2019s warships entry to their ports, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said, adding that \u2018Western colleagues\u2019 need to decide who they are actually fight against \u2013 terrorists or Russia. \\n\u201cThe movement of our ships has caused a stir among our Western partners, \u201d Shoigu said on Tuesday. \\n\u201c But the most surprising thing was the position of certain countries that, under pressure from the US and NATO, have publicly refused our warships entry to their ports. \u201d \\n\u201cIt did not affect the schedule of their movement along the chosen route, as they had been provided with all the necessary resources,\u201d he added. \\nThe defense minister noted that the decisions of some countries to deny Russian ships entry to Western ports has demonstrated how, in fact, \u201c our partners understand their contribution to the fight against international terrorism in Syria.\u201d \\n\u201cIt is time for our Western colleagues to decide who they are actually fighting \u2013 terrorists or Russia. As one poet once said, \u2018one cannot sit on one and the same place on different trains,\u2019\u201d Shoigu added. \\nThe Ministry of Defense has released a sneak peak video, showing raw images of Russia\u2019s ship-borne air strike force and warships, headed by the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, but it is unclear when exactly the footage was shot. \\nA war of words was unleashed in late October when the Spanish media reported that the Russian naval ships would be making a stopover at the autonomous port of Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar. \\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made it crystal clear that the bloc wanted Madrid to rethink the stopover permit. \u201c We are concerned and I have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase Russia\u2019s ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against Syria ,\u201d he said at that time. Russia withdraws request for carrier battle group to refuel in Spain amid NATO pressure on Madrid \\nBelgium\u2019s former prime minister and current EU envoy to the UK for Brexit talks, Guy Verhofstadt, said in a Facebook post that, despite being a NATO member, Spain \u201cprovides assistance to a fleet which has one purpose, \u201d noting that \u201c only last week this Spanish Government signed up to a statement from the European Council accusing Russia of war crimes against civilians in Aleppo.\u201d \\nReneging on a previous agreement with Moscow, the Spanish Foreign Ministry reacted by issuing a statement declaring that Madrid could refuse permission to the Russian warships, which were heading for the Mediterranean to enter Ceuta, a Spanish enclave on the North African coast. \\nWhile the Western media reported that Russia had withdrawn its request for a stopover, the Russian Defense Ministry said such a stop had never been on the schedule in the first place. \\n\u201cThe Russian aircraft carrier group is fully supplied with sufficient material stocks to carry out its mission in the off-shore maritime zone in autonomous mode,\u201d said ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov. \\nSoon thereafter, Malta was forced to make a statement refuting media reports that the carrier group would be refueling at one of its ports. \\nThe Russian warships, including the Admiral Kuznetsov, the Pyotr Veliky battle cruiser, and the Severomorsk and Vice-Admiral Kulakov anti-submarine warfare destroyers, were sent to the Mediterranean on October 15. \\n\u201cThe goal of the campaign is to ensure a naval presence in operationally important areas of the oceans,\u201d Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement. \\nREAD MORE: Battle Stations! Putin\u2019s fearsome fleet locked, loaded & ready for war with Britain\u2026 or not \\nThe Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group\u2019s tour has caused a media frenzy across Europe, with British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships as they rounded European shores through international waters. \\nShoigu said on Tuesday that the Russian naval group had arrived in the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean, according to TASS news agency. \\n\u201cLast week, our ship-borne air strike force, led by the missile cruiser Pyotr Veliky, made a passage through the eastern Atlantic into the Mediterranean Sea. On October 27-29, support vessels replenished the naval group with all kinds of supplies to the required level, \u201d Shoigu said.
