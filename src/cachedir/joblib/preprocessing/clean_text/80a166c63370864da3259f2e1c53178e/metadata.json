A year ago, that is what most movie studios would have said about   musicals, pointing to a long line of box office calamities: \u201cRock of Ages,\u201d \u201cBurlesque,\u201d \u201cJersey Boys,\u201d \u201cAcross the Universe,\u201d \u201cNine. \u201d The few    successes in recent decades have been adaptations of Broadway classics (\u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d 2012) or marketed in misleading ways. When 20th Century Fox was selling Baz Luhrmann\u2019s hit \u201cMoulin Rouge!\u201d in 2001, the studio was so afraid that people would stay home if they knew it was a musical that the trailer rather awkwardly tried to avoid singing at all costs. But Hollywood, excited in part by the critical and commercial success of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d which cost Lionsgate $30 million to make and has taken in $132 million worldwide as it streaks toward the Academy Awards, is taking out its jazz hands again. There are roughly 20 musicals in the works at studios, according to the film database IMDBpro. Some are   adaptations of classic animated musicals, like \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d directed by Bill Condon and set for release by Disney in March. Others are films (among them, \u201cWicked\u201d) based on contemporary Broadway hits. Moreover, several studios  \u2014   for the first time since the 1990s  \u2014   are devoting meaningful resources to    films with original music. This year, Fox will release \u201cThe Greatest Showman,\u201d which stars Hugh Jackman as the circus impresario P. T. Barnum it has a dozen original songs. Disney has \u201cBob the Musical,\u201d about a man whose life becomes filled with song after a head injury. Universal Pictures won a bidding war for an untitled musical comedy starring Josh Gad, with original songs by the   Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. There are several reasons for renewed studio interest, said Marc Platt, a \u201cLa La Land\u201d producer whose other projects include an original    film that will star Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig and a sequel to \u201cMary Poppins\u201d with a new score. \u201cThankfully, as much as Hollywood is interested in brands, I think people are still looking for originality and freshness,\u201d Mr. Platt said. \u201cMusicals can also be their own brand: They have an event status. I also think the ceiling on the audience is lifting. You\u2019ve got a new generation of fans who have grown up with television shows like \u2018Glee. \u2019\u201d Mr. Platt added, \u201cMusic has a way of getting inside all of us and lifting us up. \u201d Put another way, there is an inherent entertainment proposition in musicals, a heightened emotional experience that people go to the movies to find. Mr. Platt, a former senior executive at Universal (and the father of Ben Platt, star of the hit stage production \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d) has in many ways become Hollywood\u2019s   producer of movie musicals. In 2014, he shepherded Disney\u2019s adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d which took in $213 million worldwide. As a major force behind \u201cWicked\u201d on Broadway, Mr. Platt is working with Stephen Daldry (who directed the film version of \u201cBilly Elliot\u201d) to bring a movie version to theaters in 2019. \u201cYes, still on track,\u201d Mr. Platt said of that   project. Nothing fuels a Hollywood boom (or a boomlet, as the case may be with musicals) like a track record of success. And some studio executives said that they were becoming more open to musicals because the animated variety had experienced such a renaissance. \u201cFrozen\u201d was a monster hit, selling $1. 3 billion in tickets worldwide. Over the past few months, three animated musicals  \u2014   \u201cSing,\u201d \u201cMoana\u201d and \u201cTrolls\u201d  \u2014   have taken in a combined $1 billion at the global box office. Disney will release a singalong version of \u201cMoana\u201d (with lyrics on the screen, karaoke style) on Jan. 27. Some studios have also had recent success with   including films like \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d that rely on pop hits and mostly keep the singing to stage settings. Television may also be giving film executives confidence specials like \u201cThe Wiz Live!\u201d and \u201cGrease: Live\u201d have reintroduced    entertainment to a mass audience. Still, not everyone in Hollywood is convinced of a musical comeback. Kevin Goetz, chief executive of the film research company Screen   said in an email that he had no research indicating increased demand. \u201cI think it\u2019s a long shot to think that animated movies with music, which have been around for years now, have a material effect in increasing the desire to see   musicals,\u201d he added. If \u201cLa La Land\u201d is an exception to the box office rules, it is becoming quite an exception. On social media sites like Instagram and Facebook, young people  \u2014   no prompting from Lionsgate, it promises  \u2014   have been uploading videos of themselves singing \u201cAudition,\u201d one of the film\u2019s showcase numbers. During the past week, the soundtrack has shot up the sales charts. \u201cLa La Land,\u201d starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as aspiring performers, won a record seven Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 8, including one for Damien Chazelle\u2019s directing and one for Justin Hurwitz\u2019s score. Powered by that publicity pop, the film took in about $14. 5 million over the weekend (its sixth in release) in North America. The producers of \u201cLa La Land\u201d also include Jordan Horowitz and Fred Berger. The weekend\u2019s No. 1 film was the   drama \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d which collected a strong $20 million. Produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films and released by Fox, \u201cHidden Figures\u201d has a domestic total after four weeks of about $54. 8 million.'"}, "time": 1742563840.9423132}
