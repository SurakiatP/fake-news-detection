Odds are good her husband hates her, too. But there are some folks on the left who not only don\u2019t hate her. They view her as some sort of sympathetic figure. The pretty princess in the tower locked up by the orange ogre with the bad combover, a princess desperately blinking out distress signals during   ceremonies and inaugural balls. \u201d He added, \u201cI think we can credit that undeserving charitable view of our new first lady to our propensity as humans, as a species to think that the insides of pretty people match the outsides of pretty people. And that may be true sometimes but only randomly. And everyone always beware of confirmation bias. And you know what it\u2019s definitely not true in this case. Mrs. Trump, Melania Trump, is as ugly on the inside as she is pretty on the outside. She is a birther. Pretty Melania went on TV to push the same racist conspiracy theories about Barack Obama that her husband did. She\u2019s an immigrant who doesn\u2019t give a s**t about the plight of other immigrants. She\u2019s famously a plagiarist. And she\u2019s brought ruinous lawsuits against journalists and bloggers accusing them of, among other things, potentially interfering with her ability to profit off her role as first lady. \u201d (  The Wrap) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562310.065963}
