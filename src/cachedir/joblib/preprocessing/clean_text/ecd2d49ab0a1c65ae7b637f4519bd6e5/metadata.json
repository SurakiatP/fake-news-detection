The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that anyone older than six months get one by the end of October, though late is better than never. Yet, an online survey by CityMD, a network of urgent care centers, found that 52 percent of millennials don\u2019t plan on getting the vaccine. Turns out we have one such skeptic on staff. Jonah Engel Bromwich, my Times colleague, is a    who says he never gets a flu shot, making him exactly the kind of person who experts wish they could reach. But he has agreed to offer up his excuses so we can quash them one by one, and we thank him for that. To help, we asked Dr. Joseph Bresee, chief of the epidemiology branch in the influenza division of the C. D. C. to take us through the rebuttals to the most common excuses he hears. DANIEL: So, tell us, Jonah  \u2014   what\u2019s going on here? Why are you ignoring the doctors? JONAH: I\u2019m very tough. I\u2019ve never gotten the flu. Why should I get a flu shot? My immune system is   \u2026     good. I just don\u2019t see the need for it. DANIEL: I have no doubt that you are tough, and I bet your immune system is something to be very proud of. But the fact is, an estimated 5 percent to 20 percent of the United States population gets the flu each year, Dr. Bresee said. The fact that you\u2019ve never gotten the flu is no indication that you won\u2019t get it in the future. You\u2019re essentially rolling the dice anew each year, and there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019re eventually gonna get a bad roll. JONAH: I\u2019m a gambler. DANIEL: I wish you luck in Atlantic City. But a flu shot isn\u2019t just about you. As a healthy   you might not have underlying medical issues that would make the flu extra dangerous. For you, it might just mean a lousy week in bed. But sadly, others don\u2019t have that luxury. To people around you, especially pregnant women, young children and older family members, the flu could be a much bigger problem, even deadly. Once it\u2019s your turn to get the flu  \u2014   and surely you know it\u2019ll happen eventually  \u2014   you\u2019d be needlessly exposing other people to harm. \u201cIf the message to protect yourself is not effective, maybe do it to be a good community member,\u201d Dr. Bresee said. JONAH: O. K. ugh, I don\u2019t want to make people sick. But don\u2019t flu shots give you a mini version of the flu? Aren\u2019t they just transmitting flu germs into you? DANIEL: Nope. You\u2019re far from alone in thinking so, but it\u2019s just not true. Dr. Bresee said flu shots back in the 1960s and \u201970s were associated with some mild reactions, including fevers. But modern vaccines have greatly reduced the negative side effects, most likely leaving you with no more than a mild bit of soreness in your arm. The C. D. C. states it plainly: \u201cNo, a flu shot cannot cause flu illness. \u201d JONAH: But everyone always says that it was getting the shot that made them sick in the first place! Are they lying? DANIEL: I don\u2019t doubt some people got sick soon after getting a shot, but they\u2019re probably misunderstanding what actually caused their sicknesses. People get sick all the time, so it makes a lot of sense that people would come down with a cold or \u201cflulike symptoms\u201d in a time frame that just so happens to be a few days after getting a shot. That in no way suggests that the shot caused it. Though it might be tempting to make the connection to the flu shot when you\u2019re in bed sneezing, correlation is not causation. It\u2019s also possible to be exposed to the flu shortly before the shot or in the   period in which the vaccine takes effect. That\u2019s not the vaccine\u2019s fault. JONAH: Hmm. Fine. But how do I know it\u2019s going to work? DANIEL: Well, you don\u2019t  \u2014   but it definitely increases your odds of staying healthy. The performance of the vaccine changes year to year, but Dr. Bresee said you\u2019re about 50 percent to 60 percent less likely to get the flu by getting the shot. JONAH: All right, Daniel. You got me. These are good arguments. DANIEL: So, you\u2019re convinced? JONAH: No. I just don\u2019t want to get a shot. I don\u2019t want green goo going into my arm. It\u2019s weird! I\u2019m not into it. DANIEL: I confess I did not ask Dr. Bresee about the color of what\u2019s going into your arm, so I can\u2019t help you there. JONAH:   \u2026     DANIEL:   \u2026     JONAH: O. K. I\u2019ll say it: It hurts! I\u2019m scared of needles. DANIEL: I get it. But I promise you: It doesn\u2019t hurt that much, and as a giant wuss who recently got my flu shot, I can say that with authority. It\u2019s really not that bad. If you\u2019re especially concerned about it, you can get an intradermal shot that uses a smaller needle that you won\u2019t even see and goes into your skin instead of your muscle. It\u2019s barely a pinch. Get a shot, Jonah. JONAH: Fine. I will.'"}, "time": 1742628480.5198712}
