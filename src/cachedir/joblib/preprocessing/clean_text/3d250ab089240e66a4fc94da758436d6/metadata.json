In a typical week on the PGA Tour, the players are handed the keys to luxury vehicles. In Rio de Janeiro, they rode in shuttle buses or were driven around in armored cars by members of a security detail. On Sunday, a week after Bubba Watson finished in a tie for 25th at the PGA Tour stop in Connecticut and collected a $47, 226. 66 check, he earned nothing for finishing tied for eighth at the Rio Games, which he described as \u201cone of the greatest golf trips I\u2019ve ever been on. \u201d The biosphere that the golfers normally inhabit was broadened immeasurably during the weeklong competition that culminated with the coronation of Britain\u2019s Justin Rose, who closed with a   67 to win the first gold medal awarded in golf since 1904. Rose, the 2013 United States Open champion, finished at 16 under par, two strokes ahead of the reigning British Open champion, Henrik Stenson of Sweden. Rose and Stenson arrived at the 18th hole tied at 15 under. Rose hit his third shot about three feet from the hole and then watched as Stenson   for bogey. Rose made his birdie putt to claim the gold. Matt Kuchar of the United States carded the day\u2019s lowest round, a 63, to claim the bronze at 13 under. As he came off the 18th green, Kuchar pulled his wife, Sybi, into a lingering embrace. When they separated, he told her, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy with a   finish in my life. \u201d Despite not winning a medal, Watson, a   Masters champion, said: \u201cThis is the greatest sporting event I\u2019ve ever been a part of. I get to go to the Masters for the rest of my life, but it\u2019s just golf. \u201d The sport\u2019s return to the Olympics got off to an inauspicious start, with many of the best players, including the top four in the rankings, opting out because of health concerns, security fears and scheduling issues. Those who came appeared prepared to leave with lasting memories and no apparent regrets. \u201cOnce we got down here, we realized what a great experience it was,\u201d said Rose, who was inspired to win a medal for his wife, Kate, a former member of the British acrobatic gymnastics team. She was a European champion who rose to fourth in the world before retiring at age 17 without having had a chance to compete in the Olympics because her sport was not included in the Summer Games. \u201cI was very excited about golf in the Olympics,\u201d Kate Rose said. \u201cAt least one of us will get to the Olympics. So from the beginning, he really embraced it. \u201d While golf\u2019s   Big Four  \u2014   Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy  \u2014   stayed home, Rose and his wife ventured out to watch gymnastics. Watson turned up at diving, swimming, women\u2019s field hockey and men\u2019s basketball sessions. Stenson checked in at handball matches. When golfers talk about their team, they typically mean their caddies. At the Olympics, Rose\u2019s support group included all the athletes competing for Britain and every fan on the course waving the Union Jack. A sellout crowd of 12, 000 flocked to the course Sunday. The spectators\u2019   support for their countrymen dispelled the notion that golf is an individual sport. \u201cWith the flags and everything, it\u2019s as emotional as I\u2019ve ever felt about a win,\u201d said Rose\u2019s caddie, Mark Fulcher. \u201cHonestly, bless athletics,\u201d he added, referring to track and field. \u201cIt looked great, but it was a   stadium. There was nothing   about this place today. It was an amazing atmosphere. \u201d At the start of the week, Rose and Fulcher added an app to their phones to receive alerts whenever a British athlete wins a gold medal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty amazing seeing the gold flip up with Rosie,\u201d Fulcher said. During his down time, Kuchar attended a bronze medal tennis match featuring the American doubles team of Jack Sock and Steve Johnson. He watched the Americans finish off their Canadian opponents and run toward the players\u2019 box, shouting giddily about getting to wear their \u201cpodium jackets. \u201d The scene stuck with Kuchar, who said he got to thinking about how nice it would be to wear the United States jacket that was reserved for the medals ceremony. On Sunday, his eyes welled up as he talked about his podium jacket moment. \u201cIt was just an overwhelming feeling of pride,\u201d he said. Kuchar\u2019s caddie, John Wood, stood by his man all day only to be separated from him for the medals ceremony. Wood did not care that the caddies do not get medals. He choked up and took several seconds to compose himself. \u201cBeing a part of this,\u201d Wood said, \u201cI don\u2019t need anything else. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561654.2637131}
