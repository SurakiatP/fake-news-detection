Despite this, many parents will have a hard time following some of his suggestions (e.g. no manufactured baby food, no formula, no circumcision, avoid acetaminophen), as he advises parents to come to \u201cwell child visits with a signed vaccine refusal form\u201d and specifically warns against hepatitis, chicken pox, flu, polio, and HPV vaccines, among others.\u201d \\nThe review goes on: \\n\u201cVERDICT While Thomas does recommend a number of vaccines, his medical wisdom is too removed from both the AAP and the CDC (Centers   Prevention) guidelines to warrant a recommendation.\u201d \\nDon\u2019t make this book available to library patrons. \\nDon\u2019t read this book. \\nDon\u2019t even have a conversation about safety issues with childhood vaccines. \\nInstead, let\u2019s just ignore the fact that the current rates of autism are at least 1 in 68, according to the CDC (possibly as high as 1 in 45 , also according to CDC data), that there\u2019s a growing body of very disturbing scientific evidence showing that acetaminophen (the main ingredient in Tylenol) is triggering autism , and that American children today are plagued with allergies, asthma, and other chronic diseases (like Type 1 juvenile diabetes and leaky gut syndrome) than ever before. \\nBut following Dr. Paul\u2019s recommendations to feed a baby and small child a real food, whole foods diet, stop using Tylenol , and making judicious decisions about vaccination is too difficult?
