Every nationalist movement, such as Vietnam\u2019s effort to throw off French colonialism, was misinterpreted as another domino falling to Soviet world conquest. This mistaken American belief persisted despite Stalin\u2019s purge of the Trotsky elements that preached world revolution. Stalin declared: \u201csocialism in one country.\u201d \\nAs the Soviets did not have the aim that the US attributed to them, the two governments could cooperate in reducing the dangerous tensions that nuclear weapons presented. \\nThe rise of the American neoconservatives and their doctrine of US world hegemony has given the United States the expansionist ideology formerly attributed to the Soviets. Only this time the expansionist ideology is real. Yet, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Lavrov, said today that \u201cwe [the US and Russia] have no ideological differences which make the Cold War inevitable.\u201d https://sputniknews.com/politics/201610251046697689-lavrov-russia-cold-war/ \\nThe inability of the Russian government to understand that the neoconservative ideology of US world hegemony is the driving force of US foreign policy leaves Lavrov puzzled at the high level of hostility toward Russia. As Lavrov believes that there are no ideological differences between the two countries, he doesn\u2019t understand the hostility. However, he does understand that this hostility toward Russia is a negation of Cold War rules that both countries avoid surprising the other with what could be perceived as a dangerous threat. \\nThere is no sign that the US government understands the danger in Russia\u2019s perception of threat or that Washington cares.'"}, "time": 1742563421.2564387}
