[The new policy, which will go into effect in Fall 2017, will prevent students from putting up white boards outside of their dorm rooms in an effort to curb issues with bullying on campus.  \u201cIn any given month, there are several incidents like this. There was no one incident that was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d said Kat Cooper, director of University Residential Services Communications. \u201cSometimes these things are racial, sometimes they\u2019re sexual in nature. There are all sorts of things that happen. \u201d   Cooper argued that the increasing amount of inappropriate messages written on white boards was enough for the school to rethink their policy on their usage in dormitory hallways. \u201cTheir utility as a communication tool no longer outweighed the attractive nuisance that they are,\u201d Kat Cooper said. Other students aren\u2019t thrilled about the new policy. Michigan State sophomore Brad Kain claimed that it is unfair to the students who \u201cuse them on their doors\u201d as a way to \u201cbrighten up people\u2019s day. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all adults,\u201d Kain said. \u201cI think they should find another way of handling the problem,\u201d Johnson said.'"}, "time": 1742628353.3631554}
