He brought a drink with him to the stage a standup roadie (tequila). \u201cAnd boy did I miss it,\u201d he joked with me last week. \u201cWhat an idiot all those years  \u2014   drinking\u2019s fun. You hear that, kids? Drinking\u2019s fun!\u201d Actually, that\u2019s not why he did it, he said during a marathon session of talking and drinking  \u2014   and, in his case, a wee bit of pot smoking  \u2014   that started at his house here and ended several hours later at the nearby Polo Lounge (oh, the indignities of this job). He says he considers drinking on stage unprofessional. But that night, so soon after the election, he needed something to calm his nerves. Donald J. Trump, who Mr. Maher said \u201clives for vengeance,\u201d had just won control over the most powerful instruments of the government, like the Justice Department, and, more to the point, the F. B. I. And it was dawning on Mr. Maher that \u201cno one\u2019s been meaner to him than me. \u201d Mr. Maher has a unique perspective. He resides at that most treacherous intersection where free speech meets government power and political passion, dodging traffic from left and right. He also once accused Mr. Trump of being part orangutan by birth. But first, a refresher on how Mr. Maher became a   totem in 2001 with one provocative line on his   ABC show, \u201cPolitically Incorrect. \u201d He said the Sept. 11 hijackers couldn\u2019t be called \u201ccowards,\u201d especially when the United States\u2019 preferred method of attack at the time  \u2014   before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  \u2014   was to lob cruise missiles from afar (\u201cThat\u2019s cowardly,\u201d he said). The White House criticized him, sponsors fled and, a few months later, ABC canceled his show. Whatever you might think of his argument, the moment was a dark chapter in the annals of public discourse. It could have been a   too, if HBO hadn\u2019t provided Mr. Maher with safe harbor and a new show, \u201cReal Time,\u201d which has an audience of about 4. 5 million viewers. Yet, Mr. Maher puts that episode within \u201cthe normal parameters of awful. \u201d He says he\u2019s more worried about our new era, when no one knows what \u201cnormal\u201d is going to look like. It\u2019s amazing how much anxiety Mr. Trump\u2019s imminent inauguration is stirring in the   business  \u2014   but perhaps not surprising given his open hostility toward the press, his willingness to use his platform against any who cross him and his seemingly proud dismissal of the government and political norms that precede him. No one knows whether a year from now, we\u2019ll see today\u2019s fears as overblown, underblown, or on point. Mr. Maher is taking the    approach based on his own experience in the Trumpian combat caldron in 2013. That was when Mr. Maher launched a \u201cbirther\u201d \u2014   or, \u201c \u201d  \u2014   campaign about Mr. Trump, to rival the one Mr. Trump had pursued about President Obama\u2019s citizenship. Appearing on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u2019\u2019 he joked that Mr. Trump was the product of   crossbreeding it was the only thing, he said, that would explain the \u201ccolor of his hair. \u201d He said he would donate $5 million to a charity of Mr. Trump\u2019s choice if he could prove this wasn\u2019t the case. (Mr. Maher pledged $1 million in 2012 to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Obama.) Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers replied with a copy of his   birth certificate and a demand for the money, which Mr. Maher ignored. Then Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit that ultimately went nowhere. \u201cIt was worth it in comedy material,\u201d Mr. Maher told me, taking a couple of puffs from a pipe molded into a bust of his head (a gift from a friend) as we stood by the bar in his   living room. \u201cBut you definitely spent money. \u201d That is, Mr. Maher had the money to pay for the courage that another comedian may not have been able to afford. He takes it as a harbinger. \u201cNo one knows what this man is capable of,\u201d Mr. Maher said. \u201cI never, ever, ever felt worried  \u2014   it never crossed my mind  \u2014   that George Bush would do something crazy, even though I knew he hated me. He never sued me for a joke. \u201d Mr. Maher was particularly focused on reports that several F. B. I. agents were agitating before the election for more aggressive examination of Hillary Clinton, which Democrats feared was politically motivated to help Mr. Trump. (The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general has announced a broad investigation into the F. B. I. \u2019s   performance.) \u201cIt is a very troubling idea that the F. B. I. is politicized,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the internal police department is politicized, that\u2019s a place I don\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of  \u2014   I mean, that\u2019s fascism. \u201d You could chalk it all up to shticky paranoia, and it\u2019s quite a slippery slope from there to outright fascism. But with so many sharing similar worries (at least among those who didn\u2019t support Mr. Trump) and with Mr. Trump\u2019s continued cage rattling, I turned to Mr. Trump\u2019s adviser, Kellyanne Conway, for a response. It seemed especially fitting because she has been a longtime guest of Mr. Maher\u2019s, dating to the 1990s when he was first blazing the   trail on Comedy Central. Given Mr. Trump\u2019s preference for Twitter, Ms. Conway joked, using the F. B. I. would be \u201cso last century  \u2014   it\u2019s so bureaucratic and paperwork laden. \u201d Turning more serious, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to use the \u2018tools of state,\u2019\u201d repeating the wording of my question. I noted that there are, of course, guidelines, professional tenets and laws that are meant to preclude a president\u2019s ability to use federal investigative power as a political weapon, and she agreed, saying \u201cThis is America. \u201d Ms. Conway acknowledged, though, that Mr. Maher\u2019s fears were widely held, especially in Hollywood  \u2014   witness Meryl Streep\u2019s Golden Globes address. \u201cTalk about a Hollywood story  \u2014   folks are unnecessarily flattering themselves to think for two seconds that Donald Trump is going to call out the big dogs to make their lives miserable,\u201d she said. She described some of the discomfort as a natural reaction by \u201cthe elites\u201d to an incoming president who is merely responding to their continued attacks. \u201cWhere\u2019s the respect  \u2014   open ear and open mind? \u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThe same people who had hoped for and desired and absolutely assumed they were going to get a different election result never laid down their muskets,\u201d she said. It was time, she said, to \u201ctake the poison out of the pen and keyboard. \u201d Mr. Maher has no plans to do that when his show comes back from hiatus on inauguration day, Jan. 20 (his birthday, and Ms. Conway\u2019s). But he shares Ms. Conway\u2019s view of the cultural stakes in the election. \u201cWe\u2019re the losers now, so it behooves us to break out of that bubble more,\u201d he said. Mr. Maher said speeches like Ms. Streep\u2019s  \u2014   calling actors, screenwriters and the news media to arms  \u2014   weren\u2019t going to solve anything. \u201cIt looks very insular,\u201d he said. \u201cJust the liberals talking to themselves, which they are very good at doing. \u201d Still the bane of conservatives, Mr. Maher has more recently drawn scorn from liberals for his own diatribes against Islamic extremism, for which he says liberals have too much tolerance. That\u2019s part of what he considers a politically correct corralling of speech from the left. At the same time, his restaurant selection, the Polo Lounge, in the Beverly Hills Hotel, came in defiance of a Hollywood boycott that Ellen DeGeneres and Elton John helped start after the sultan of Brunei, whose investment agency owns the hotel, imposed a new penal code in his homeland based on Shariah law, making gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death. To join the boycott, Mr. Maher said as we walked through the hotel lobby, would be to submit to an ineffectual form of \u201ctokenism. \u201d \u201cAs if the sultan of Brunei is up there looking at the receipts  \u2014   we only sold two soups? Is Stallone still coming in?\u201d he said. \u201cBut Sultan, your harem awaits  \u2014   \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m still going over the receipts. \u2019\u201d With that, we took our seats and the waiter approached. Surprised to see Mr. Maher, he asked \u201cYou\u2019re not in hiding?\u201d That got Mr. Maher all worked up again. \u201cI can be scared,\u201d he said, \u201cand never pull a punch. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561705.8974519}
