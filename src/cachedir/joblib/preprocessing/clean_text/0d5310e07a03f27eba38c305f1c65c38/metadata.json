In fact, just a short while after Hillary Clinton\u2019s henchmen cut him off from the rest of the world, it seems that Assange is about to get himself some sweet revenge \u2013 and hopefully, the presidential hopeful likes the color orange. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange (left) and Hillary Clinton (right) \\nDemocrats are using every dirty trick in the book, despite their recent motto being \u201cwhen they go low, we\u2019ll go high.\u201d In fact, it certainly seems that the only people going low are Hillary Clinton and those fiercely trying to force the American people to let her into the Oval Office. \\nProving just that, it seems that Barack Obama put on the pressure , on behalf of Hillary\u2019s best interest, leading to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange being cut off from communicating with the world. Although the Ecuadorian government severed his Internet access, claiming they didn\u2019t want to influence an election and Democrats just shrugged off the matter, the American people could see through the line of crap we were being fed. \\nUnfortunately for Hillary and everyone who has lied and deceived in her name, it looks like her campaign is about to come to a screeching halt as the WikiLeaks founder has just promised to get himself some sweet revenge . Now experiencing just how corrupt the left is, Assange claims that his \u201cnext leak will result in the arrest of Hillary Clinton.\u201d \\nLet\u2019s just hope Hillary likes the color orange because it looks like she\u2019s about to spend quite a few years wearing a prison jumpsuit. In all, Assange still has over 50,000 emails to release \u2014 and those are just the ones belonging to John Podesta.'"}, "time": 1742628489.1285148}
