Again. To detain one of India\u2019s biggest celebrities would itself attract international headlines, but this, he said, was the third time that he had been held then released while traveling in the United States. His treatment at American airports was already a sore point among his fans as well as critics of airport security procedures, with each episode sparking outrage and discussion. Mr. Khan was estimated to have a net worth of $600 million in 2014, making him one of the richest actors in the world, just after Jerry Seinfeld. Mr. Khan did not name the airport or say why he had been held, but Rich Verma, the American ambassador to India, said in an apology on Twitter that the incident had happened at Los Angeles International Airport. Mr. Khan\u2019s previous interactions with immigration officials followed a similar pattern of being held for a few hours before being released. In 2009, Mr. Khan, 50, was detained in Newark while in the United States to promote his film \u201cMy Name is Khan,\u201d which was about racial profiling of Muslims after the Sept. 11 attacks. In the movie, his character insists he is not a terrorist when he is searched at the San Francisco airport. Then in 2012, he was held in White Plains, N. Y. on his way to address students at Yale. \u201cWhenever I start feeling too arrogant about myself, I always take a trip to America,\u201d he later told the students. With humor, he relayed his frustration on Thursday to his 20. 7 million Twitter followers. (For reference, he has roughly the same number of followers as Eminem, Nicki Minaj and Kourtney Kardashian.) Nisha Biswal, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, tweeted: \u201cSorry for the hassle at the airport, @iamsrk  \u2014   even American diplomats get pulled for extra screening!\u201d Mr. Khan responded to her tweet: \u201cNo hassle ma\u2019m. \u201d He said he respected the protocol and did not expect special treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s just inconvenient. \u201d A spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection said she could not discuss individual cases, citing privacy laws. On Twitter, the incident prompted condemnation and accusations of racial profiling. Mr. Khan\u2019s immediate response to Thursday\u2019s episode, complete with a Pok\u00e9mon Go joke, is in line with how he has spoken about his past detentions. In his address to Yale students in 2012, he made light of his interaction with immigration officials. \u201cThey always ask me how tall I am and I always lie and get away with it and say 5 feet 10 inches. Next time I am getting more adventurous. \u2018What color are you?\u2019 I am going to say white. \u201d In 2013, he wrote about his experience and about the stereotypes he encounters as a Muslim with the last name of Khan, including his security   at American airports. \u201cI wonder, at times, whether the same treatment is given to everyone whose last name just happens to be McVeigh (as in Timothy)?\u201d he wrote, referring to the Oklahoma City bomber.'"}, "time": 1742563088.1354795}
