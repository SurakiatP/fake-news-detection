Partial transcript as follows: RUSH LIMBAUGH, HOST: Let me ask you a question. Is it unreasonable, is it unreasonable that President Trump would suspect he\u2019s being spied on? It\u2019s not unreasonable, is it? Telephone calls that he\u2019s made to presidents of other countries have been leaked, transcripts have been leaked  \u2026     So a lot to try to explain here today, and it all makes sense when it is explained in not just necessarily a timeline format, but just when you provide and when you learn the information of things that are going on, all of this makes sense. It all seems reasonable. It all seems like it could be happening. We know, for example, that there has been an effort on the part of what I\u2019ve been calling the deep state, this is embedded Obamaites that are in the bureaucracy that have been trying to sabotage and undermine the Trump administration ever since he was elected and through the transition into the inauguration and up to now. I mean, this is undeniable. These various leaks, many of them are criminal. How are people getting this information? How are people acquiring the information that they are disseminating? I have here, ladies and gentlemen, I went and looked and I\u2019ve got a copy here of the actual New York Times front page on January 20th of this year. And the primary story, the lead story, \u201cTrump Arrives, Set to Assume Power. \u201d But right next to it is this headline: \u201cWiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides. \u201d Well, the New York Times has a story back in January admitting that wiretapped data has been used in an inquiry of Trump aides. And this article goes on to say \u201cintelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House. \u201d So it isn\u2019t unreasonable at all for Donald Trump to suspect that he\u2019s being tapped, that his aides are being tapped, at Trump Tower. We know that there were two FISA warrants that were issued starting last summer and then another one in October, and I want to walk you through those as the program unfolds today. It\u2019s kind of unsettling. I mean, you don\u2019t want to think things like this happen, but you know that they do, and so you have to face it. And we are in a polarized circumstance in our country. We are really divided, and the gap is wide. The partisanship is profound and it\u2019s worsening here, to the point that there isn\u2019t any common ground and crossing the aisle and shaking hands and cooperating. This is a war that\u2019s going to result in somebody winning and somebody losing, within a political context, of course. And what\u2019s new about this one is we have a Republican president for the first time in my lifetime fighting back. Well, I can\u2019t exclude Ronald Reagan from that. And I actually think a part of this  \u2014   and I can\u2019t substantiate this, \u2019cause it goes to motive  \u2014   but I think part of what President Trump is doing by tweeting out on Saturday that he believes the Obama administration\u2019s wiretapping him, I think he\u2019s not just tweeting to the American public and tweeting to the news media. I think Trump confounds these people because he\u2019s always a step or two ahead. Trump plays the long game. And I think in addition to whatever else these tweets are intended to accomplish, it\u2019s also a direct line to the Democrat Party and Obama and members of the Obama administration that Trump is signaling, \u201cYou don\u2019t face the usual feckless bunch of opponents who never fight you back. You\u2019ve got me here, and if you\u2019re gonna start lying about me, if you\u2019re gonna keep lying about me, I\u2019m not gonna sit here and take it. \u201d Now, why might Trump think that he\u2019s been bugged? Why might he believe that Trump Tower has been bugged? Well, folks, from the moment that Donald Trump won the election back in November, there have been leaks, illegal leaks that were no question hopefully damaging. There has been a sabotage effort to undermine Trump and his administration since the election. We\u2019ve talked about it ever since it began. I\u2019ve had various names for it, the deep state, Friday called it silent coup or whatever, but there isn\u2019t any doubt in my mind that this is going on. The media is complicit in it, that there is an effort to undermine the Trump administration. We have these     protests that come up out of nowhere, and they appear instantly. So I think it\u2019s totally reasonable to believe that something like this could be happening. It would be unreasonable to think that this is crazy, unreasonable to think that this is absurd, unreasonable to think that this is nothing more than a big batch of conspiracy theories stitched together for whatever purpose.
