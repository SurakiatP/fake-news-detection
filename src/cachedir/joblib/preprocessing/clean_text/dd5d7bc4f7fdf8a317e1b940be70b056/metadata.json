[The Guardian reports that over 100 activists have signed an open letter calling for President Trump to drop any possible charges being brought against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. \u201cA threat to WikiLeaks\u2019 work  \u2014   which is publishing information protected under the First Amendment  \u2014   is a threat to all free journalism,\u201d the open letter reads.  The open letter, created by the Courage Foundation, warns that criminalizing a journalist or their work can lead to the criminalization of all journalism. \u201cIf the DoJ is able to convict a publisher for its journalistic work, all free journalism can be criminalized,\u201d the letter claims. The Courage Foundation is a supporter of whistleblowers, raising funds to cover the legal costs of individuals such as Edward Snowden. \u201cWe call on you as President of the United States to close the Grand Jury investigation into WikiLeaks and drop any charges planned against any member of WikiLeaks,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cIt was a free and robust press that provided you with a platform on which to run for president. \u201d \u201cDefending a truly free press requires freedom from fear and favour and the support of journalists and citizens everywhere for the kind of threat now facing WikiLeaks  \u2014   and all publishers and journalists  \u2014   is a step into the darkness,\u201d it continues. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was asked at a press conference in April if arresting Julian Assange was a priority for the Trump administration, to which Sessions replied, \u201cWe are going to step up our effort, and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks. \u201d \u201cThis is a matter that\u2019s gone beyond anything I\u2019m aware of. We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks, and some of them are quite serious,\u201d he continued to say. \u201cSo yes, it is a priority. We\u2019ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail. \u201d Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, has argued that prosecuting Assange could set a dangerous precedent. \u201cNever in the history of this country has a publisher been prosecuted for presenting truthful information to the public,\u201d Wizner told CNN in April. \u201cAny prosecution of WikiLeaks for publishing government secrets would set a dangerous precedent that the Trump administration would surely use to target other news organizations. \u201d Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
