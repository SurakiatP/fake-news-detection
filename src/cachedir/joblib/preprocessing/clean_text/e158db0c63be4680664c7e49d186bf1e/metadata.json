Riv\u00e8re, the president of OGC Nice, can see why his team, this season, has been cast as France\u2019s equivalent to Leicester City. He knows their stories follow the same arc: a provincial David defying overwhelming financial obstacles to outwit Goliath. He appreciates that the parallel is intended as praise, a convenient, flattering shorthand to explain the scale of Nice\u2019s achievement in competing with Monaco and Paris   at the summit of France\u2019s Ligue 1 over the last six months, maintaining a title challenge despite a budget that is a small fraction of its two bigger, richer rivals\u2019. Sitting in an office at the back of Nice\u2019s official club store, though, Riv\u00e8re does not indulge the comparison for long. What Leicester did in winning the Premier League last season, he says, came from the realms of fantasy. It was an alignment of the stars, one that can no more be explained than it can be repeated. Nice, he is convinced, is different. If Leicester was a wonderful accident, Nice\u2019s metamorphosis is entirely by design. From the outside, it is tempting  \u2014   though misguided  \u2014   to put a specific date on Nice\u2019s ascendance: Aug. 31, 2016 (more on that below). In reality, the club has been growing, slowly and steadily, ever since Riv\u00e8re, a real estate magnate, took control in 2011. When he arrived, he said, it was a \u201cclub with a bad reputation, without a strategy, a club in perdition. \u201d He has changed all of that. Nice moved into a new stadium, the     Allianz Riviera, in 2013. Riv\u00e8re is overseeing the construction of a new training facility. He has even delivered on his promise to find outside investment, having sold 80 percent of the club to a consortium of Chinese and American investors. Results on the field have consistently improved, too, culminating in last season\u2019s   finish under Coach Claude Puel. When Puel left last summer for Southampton  \u2014   a more apposite English parallel for Nice  \u2014   Riv\u00e8re persuaded Lucien Favre, an astute Swiss coach who had led Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach to the Champions League, to replace him. \u201cLike Puel, he was not at the level of Nice when he arrived,\u201d Riv\u00e8re said. \u201cHe was much higher. \u201d The squad Favre inherited was one of youth and promise, yet he has lifted it to another plane despite a wide disparity in resources. Nice\u2019s annual budget is $45 million. Monaco\u2019s is three times that, and P. S. G. \u2019s more than 10 times as large. Nice, though, has led the league for much of the season. A place in the Champions League next season now looks like the least of its ambitions. The spotlight, though, always prefers to fixate on hares, rather than tortoises. It was only on Aug. 31, when Riv\u00e8re confirmed the arrival of Mario Balotelli, the enigmatic,   Italian striker, that the rest of the world sat up and took notice of what was happening on the Riviera. The year before, Nice had signed an equally tempestuous character, the France winger Hatem Ben Arfa. The move piqued interest in France, and a degree of curiosity from the rest of Europe. Balotelli was another order of magnitude. Dozens of reporters descended on the Riviera. L\u2019\u00c9quipe, the French sports daily, devoted five pages to the signing. Nice\u2019s name flashed around the planet. \u201cWith Ben Arfa, it was Europe,\u201d Riv\u00e8re said. \u201cWith Balotelli, it was the world. \u201d Much of the coverage, naturally, centered on Balotelli\u2019s reputation, his truculence and his rebelliousness. Many felt that Nice  \u2014   like Liverpool, Milan and Manchester City before it  \u2014   would struggle to control Balotelli, to restore his focus. The move was dismissed, in some quarters, as a publicity stunt. Riv\u00e8re was more confident. \u201cI do not often do this,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I looked at everything that had been said about him. I asked to see the videos of his matches, the good and the bad. I saw 20 bad things and just one good thing. \u201cOne day, after training at Manchester City, he met a small boy. He asked him what he was doing there, and the boy said he did not want to go to school, because he had been bullied. So Balotelli took the boy to school in his car, so the boy could feel like a star, and sorted out the problem. I said that if he had done this, he must have a good heart. \u201d Riv\u00e8re has been proved right: Working to a customized training plan, Balotelli has thrived, emerging as a central plank of Nice\u2019s title challenge. He has scored 11 goals in 18 games though there have been controversies, they have happened to him, rather than because of him: a red card that was later rescinded, and racial abuse directed toward him during a game at Bastia. \u201cWhen a player arrives, I guarantee only one thing: that if they come to play here, they will find a family club, a good atmosphere, a good group,\u201d Riv\u00e8re said. \u201cThey will find a smile. \u201cWhen you have a player who is in trouble, the problem is often in the head, not the feet,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you had talent in the past and lost it, with us you have more chance of rediscovering the pleasure of playing football. \u201d That is not to say Riv\u00e8re is running some sort of corrective institution for the chronically wayward. Nice benefits from Balotelli just as much as he benefits from Nice, if not more on the field, of course, but off it, too. Riv\u00e8re referred to the Italian as a marketing \u201caccelerator. \u201d That is particularly important as the club tries to grow. Nice is one of the oldest soccer teams in France, and one of the proudest, too: It is the only French club with its own anthem  \u2014   \u201cNissa la Bella,\u201d or \u201cBeautiful Nice,\u201d in Ni\u00e7ois dialect. When its new stadium opened, Nice arranged for the turf from the center circle at its old home, the Stade du Ray, to be laid into the field, a symbolic gesture by club officials to worried fans that though the location had changed, Nice\u2019s heart remained the same. And yet the city seems too genteel, too well heeled, to feel as   as Marseille, for example, a couple of hours down the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. Soccer tends to thrive where it is the single unifying factor at first glance, that is not the case in Nice. The mountains are an hour away, Monte Carlo even less. There are beaches and nightclubs, money and glamour. All act as competition. So signing Balotelli was not just a way to garner international attention, but another effort to draw fans away from the various other delights of the area and into the stadium. \u201cWe try to make matches a complete experience,\u201d Riv\u00e8re said. He has always demanded that the style of play be \u201cpopular,\u201d appealing. The club regularly hands out free tickets to local children, and it has refitted all of its V. I. P. areas some do not close until the small hours of the morning. There was even an ice rink installed outside the Allianz Riviera before Christmas. It would be unfair to dismiss all of those initiatives as gimmickry, an artificial imposition of a soccer culture. Beneath the surface, the bond between this city and this club is strong. At the start of the Promenade des Anglais, in the heart of the city, is a memorial to the 86 people killed in the Bastille Day terror attack last year. It is an impossibly moving sight: a bandstand awash with thousands of teddy bears left to commemorate the dead, poems written in their honor, flags, stones, candles and messages of condolence. Rival fans have made pilgrimages here, during the season, to pay their respects: a Montpellier pennant, a Lens jersey, a scarf from F. C. Krasnodar, a Russian team, all nestle among the tributes. And everywhere, there are flashes of red and black, OGC Nice\u2019s colors, the team\u2019s identity acting as a surrogate for that of the city. It is a role that Riv\u00e8re, and the club as a whole, feel keenly. OGC Nice has helped raise hundreds of thousands of euros for the families of the victims. In the 86th minute of every home game, it remembers those who were murdered. It would be glib to say the tragedy has helped inspire Nice\u2019s success this season nobody at the club would make that claim. But they know that such events cannot only put soccer into perspective but, in the aftermath, also lend it a greater significance. This year they have a greater responsibility and, as they write this latest chapter on their fastidiously planned journey, an opportunity for a greater impact, too. \u201cWhat happened on July 14 wounded every citizen of Nice,\u201d Riv\u00e8re said. \u201cIt gives us even more willingness to succeed. We are like a medicine, for those who love football. The day of the match, the day after, we help people to forget. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564599.4810903}
