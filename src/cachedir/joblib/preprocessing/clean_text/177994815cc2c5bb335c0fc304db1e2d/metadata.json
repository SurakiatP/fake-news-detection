Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: \\nAnd the news is breaking while we\u2019re on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn\u2019t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. \\nTargets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner\u2019s well-known penchant for lying, it\u2019s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms \u2014 and, as Wallace indicated on this morning\u2019s show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We\u2019ll see if Weiner\u2019s cooperation extends beyond that. More Related'"}, "time": 1742562959.9872131}
