Our European partners agree with this,\u201d Medvedev said. \\n\u201cI am not speaking about the nature of these disputes but that we must protect our financial systems. China must protect its own system and Russia must protect its own system. Therefore, this cooperation is very useful as in this situation no-one will be capable of blocking the road of financial traffic,\u201d he emphasized. Russia looks to predictability of China\u2019s economic growth \\nRussia expects that China\u2019s economic growth will be predictable and is set to cooperate with Chinese partners for the purpose, Russia\u2019s Prime Minister said in an interview. \\n\u201cWe are interested in predictability of China\u2019s economy growth and so we are ready to work with our Chinese partners,\u201d Medvedev said, adding the Russian government was implementing a plan aimed to boost the economic growth. \\n\u201cActually, everyone needs it. Our country needs it as recently we have been plunged in a phase of such decline. Both European and US economies need it since they have not been gaining fast growth, to say nothing about Japan. Also, the Chinese economy needs it since it had been gathering speed in the past years but has slowed down later,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is closely watched by everyone as China\u2019s economy is the most significant factor of the world economic growth.\u201d. Energy and high technology sectors \\nRussia and China may reach the goal of $200bln trade by 2020 but energy and high technology sectors along with traditional trade should move up a gear, Russian Prime Minister said. \\n\u201cIndicators have been improving this year as a result of joint work of the two states, including our countries\u2019 leaders, governments, ministries, agencies and businesses,\u201d Medvedev said. Russia, China intend to develop small satellite for Wi-Fi network \\n\u201cI am convinced that if we move ahead like this, by 2020 we will be able to reach the trade of $200 billion worth. However, attention should be turned to key aspects of cooperation,\u201d he said explaining he implied the energy sector, with some projects like the Power of Siberia gas pipeline. \\n\u201cIn 2015 construction of an eastern stretch of the gas pipeline was launched,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, it includes oil supplies along the Skovorodino-Mohe (oil pipeline) extension and construction of large facilities, in particular the construction of Unit 3 at the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant.\u201d \\nBesides, high-tech projects should be enhanced, he said. \\n\u201cI mean wide-body jets, heavy helicopters and other projects in the high-tech sector,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cIt seems to me that if we diversify trade like this, our countries will be quite capable of reaching the level which we agreed on several years ago,\u201d he said in conclusion.
