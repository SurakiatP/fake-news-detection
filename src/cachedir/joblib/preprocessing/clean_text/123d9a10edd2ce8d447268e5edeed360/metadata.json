That\u2019s been true during the transition, and now especially true, that Trump is in office. Every administration, every government has leaks, but this is of a whole other level. We\u2019re seeing something so much more extreme. \u201d He added, \u201cI think it has partly to do with career government officials, who are concerned about Trump. Partly, it does have to do with some former Obama administration officials, who have their own agendas, and partly, it\u2019s a cry for help from Trump aides, from people inside the Trump White House, who may feel they\u2019re loyal to him, but believe he needs help, that he\u2019s not getting the right support. Oftentimes, people are motivated to leak in order to alert the public to a problem. \u201d Stelter further stated that government officials could be breaking the law by sharing information, and some could be felonies. Stelter also pointed out that there were leak investigations during the Obama administration. (  RCP Video) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742562167.372416}
