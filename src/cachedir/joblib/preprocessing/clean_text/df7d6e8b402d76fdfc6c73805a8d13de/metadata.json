McCutchen said he played at Fenway Park for the first time earlier this season and did not experience any racism from the fans. \u201cEveryone was pretty cool, pretty normal,\u201d McCutchen stated. The reporter then asked McCutchen about New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia saying all black players \u201cexpect\u201d racism in Boston. \u201c[E]veryone has different experiences in different divisions,\u201d he said. \u201cCC\u2019s been around longer than I have and he\u2019s played in different divisions, so he probably experiences a lot more than I have. I\u2019m sure he probably just expects that that\u2019s going to happen.
