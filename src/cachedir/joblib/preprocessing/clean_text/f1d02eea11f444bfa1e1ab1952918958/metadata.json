The actress, who last year came out as bisexual via a Snapchat video, has previously voiced her support for a number of   or   causes. In July 2015, Stenberg accused the media of ignoring and disparaging black females, arguing that they make \u201cblack women [into] objects of fetishism and brutality,\u201d and advocated support for the Black Lives Matter movement. In a   video made for a history class last year titled \u201cDon\u2019t Cash Crop On My Cornrows,\u201d Stenberg blasted artists including Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, and Iggy Azalea for   aspects of black culture for personal gain. The    actress has also described herself as an intersectional feminist, writing essays on the subject and launching a comic book with a young black female heroine. This year, Stenberg will star in the film adaption of the book Everything, Everything, and in 2018 will also play the lead role of Ruby in another adaption of the book trilogy The Darkest Minds.
