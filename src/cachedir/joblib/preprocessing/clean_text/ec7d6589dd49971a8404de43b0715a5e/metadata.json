Elizabeth Warren ( ) in 2020, calling that scenario \u201ca dream come true. \u201d[\u201cI think she would lose so badly,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters. \u201cShe hurt Hillary Clinton very badly\u201d in the 2016 presidential election, the president stated.  Warren, who has captured the hearts of progressives, was a   campaign surrogate for Clinton during the 2016 election and appeared    with Clinton in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. \u201cI watched that last couple weeks, where she was getting up with that craziness and anger,\u201d Trump said of Warren\u2019s final few appearances on the campaign trail. \u201cThey are hard. I said, \u2018She is bad for Hillary. \u2019\u201d \u201cPocahontas would not be proud of her as her representative, believe me,\u201d Trump continued, bringing up a nickname for Warren that he used from    on the campaign trail. Watters suggested that Warren would \u201cprobably run against\u201d Trump in 2020. \u201cI hope so,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cThat would be a dream come true. \u201d Warren has attacked Trump on the campaign trail, calling Trump a \u201cnasty,   fraud\u201d during the American Constitution Society convention in Washington in June. She has continued to attack Trump after he assumed the presidency, most recently for Trump\u2019s decision to fire   federal prosecutor Preet Bharara, when she said the president wants a bunch of \u201ctame prosecutors who won\u2019t investigate him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628607.28994}
