[In response to Marlow\u2019s saying it usually does not make news if conservative backlash damages a company\u2019s bottom line, Carney said, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been traditionally. But I think when you see  as extreme as what we saw with 84 Lumber, the longer version, which is on YouTube, which the NFL actually turned down to show   because it was too political  \u2014   but they still insisted on making it available   \u2026     I think this is saying, much like Kellogg but not just about Breitbart, about America, about people who voted for Donald Trump, about the country as a whole. \u201d  Added Carney, \u201c84 Lumber is saying we don\u2019t share your values. And I think Americans are going to look at that. \u201d As the controversy grew, 84 Lumber CEO Maggie Hardy Magerko appeared to walk back any perceived opposition to a border wall and President Trump. She said the ad \u201cwas not meant to be   or a political statement at all\u201d and that she is \u201ca staunch supporter of President Donald Trump,\u201d who thinks a border wall \u201cis a need. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
