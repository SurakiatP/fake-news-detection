Rice was at the center of conflict, her statements scrutinized and criticized. Now she finds herself back in the cross hairs as her handling of intelligence involving President Trump\u2019s associates comes into question. A longtime Democratic foreign policy official who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s last national security adviser, Ms. Rice has become an inkblot test in the controversy over Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election. Republicans see a partisan who mined intelligence reports to spy on Mr. Trump\u2019s team. Democrats see a scapegoat tarred for doing her job and used as a distraction from an F. B. I. investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s associates. At issue are her requests for the identities of Americans caught up in electronic surveillance of foreigners, as cited in reports provided to her by intelligence agencies: Americans who were affiliated with Mr. Trump. Ms. Rice went public in her own defense on television and Twitter on Tuesday, neither confirming nor disputing that she made such requests but arguing that any she might have made were proper and necessary, not part of political espionage against the Trump campaign. \u201cThe allegation is that somehow the Obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes,\u201d Ms. Rice told the journalist Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely false. \u201d Ms. Rice said she had sometimes asked for the names of Americans whose identities were redacted in her daily intelligence briefings in order to understand the context of what she was being told. The purpose, she said, was \u201cto do our jobs,\u201d but \u201cabsolutely not for any political purpose, to spy, expose, anything. \u201d She added that she had never made public the identities of any Trump associates mentioned in intelligence surveillance. \u201cI leaked nothing to nobody and never have and never would,\u201d Ms. Rice said. Republicans have argued that \u201cthe real story,\u201d as Mr. Trump put it, is not the F. B. I. investigation into contacts between his associates and Russia, but the conduct of the Obama administration. Mr. Trump said on Monday that he had been the target of a \u201ccrooked scheme\u201d by Mr. Obama\u2019s team, and he followed up on Tuesday by retweeting a link from the Drudge Report: \u201cRICE ORDERED SPY DOCS ON TRUMP?\u201d Fellow Republicans seized on reports about Ms. Rice in the conservative news media. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky called the reports a \u201csmoking gun\u201d and said Ms. Rice should be subpoenaed to testify. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Congress should look into the reports. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas pointed to the dispute over Ms. Rice\u2019s role in characterizing the 2012 attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, which killed the American ambassador and three other American officials. \u201cSusan Rice is the Typhoid Mary of the Obama administration foreign policy,\u201d Mr. Cotton said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show. \u201cEvery time something went wrong, she seemed to turn up in the middle of it. \u201d Where Republicans detect scandal, Democrats see a smoke screen. Mr. Trump and his allies have been looking for indications of wrongdoing by Mr. Obama\u2019s team for a month, since the president accused his predecessor of tapping telephones at Trump Tower during last year\u2019s campaign. No evidence has publicly surfaced to substantiate that claim, and it has been widely dismissed. Having failed to prove the assertion, Mr. Trump and his allies have turned to Ms. Rice. As the national security adviser, she received intelligence briefings six days a week. Last year, during the campaign, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates were caught up in eavesdropping of foreign officials. When Americans who are not the target of a warrant are mentioned in reports about such surveillance, their identities are obscured, and they are typically referred to as U. S. Person One or U. S. Person Two. But top officials, like the national security adviser, can ask the intelligence agencies to disclose the names, a process called unmasking. If the intelligence agencies agree, the briefer typically provides the identities orally. Former national security officials have said that Ms. Rice was justified in asking for the names of Trump associates referred to in reports that intelligence agencies sent to her last year. The White House was concerned about attempts by the Russian government to interfere in the election, and she had an obvious need to be fully informed, they said. Ms. Rice said Tuesday that the Russian meddling was a serious issue. \u201cIt was a grave concern to all of us in the national security team of the president and to the president himself,\u201d she said. \u201cWe took this issue very seriously. We thought it was crucial to defend the integrity of our election process. \u201d She added, \u201cFor us not to try to understand it would be a dereliction of duty. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s aides dismissed Ms. Rice\u2019s comments. \u201cLyin\u2019 leakin\u2019 Susan Rice stammered through her soft ball interview with Dem PR person Andrea Mitchell,\u201d Dan Scavino Jr. the White House social media director, wrote on Twitter. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Ms. Rice\u2019s actions seemed to contradict her previous public comments. After Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, announced last month that he had seen reports indicating that Mr. Trump or his associates might have been \u201cincidentally\u201d swept up in the monitoring of foreigners, Ms. Rice told PBS: \u201cI know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today. \u201d Mr. Spicer suggested that Ms. Rice had not been forthcoming. \u201cShe was the one who went out and said, quote, that she had nothing to do with this on a program a few weeks ago, and now you see more and more reports,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to decide who should testify or how they should do it,\u201d Mr. Spicer added. \u201cBut I do think that there\u2019s a sharp contrast between a few weeks ago, when she was very public in saying she, quote, didn\u2019t have any clue what Chairman Nunes was talking about, and yet now, we\u2019re finding out that she\u2019s trying to figure out some kind of friendly way of discussing this. \u201d Ms. Rice responded on Twitter later in the day. \u201cI said I did not know what reports Nunes was referring to when he spoke to the press,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI still do not. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563681.909271}
