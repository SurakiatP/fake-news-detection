There are a variety of indoor farming options available, including incubators that grow plants for households and vertical hydroponic systems that can churn out huge amounts of produce in warehouses. \\nThe latter is likely what would be used at Target, who has announced that they will be testing out a vertical farming system starting in Spring 2017. The trials will be done at different locations across the country that have not yet been announced, but the store plans on starting out with leafy greens and possibly building their way up to potatoes, beets, and zucchini. \\nTarget collaborated with IDEO and the MIT Media Lab and created Food + Future coLab , a group that is \u201cpushing the edges of technology, business, and design to create new, impactful ventures\u201d that change the way we know and create food. They have been researching in-store micro-farming for over a year and their findings will finally be put to the test next year. Greg Shewmaker, one of the entrepreneurs at the coLab, said, \\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s MIT, they have access to some of these seed banks around the world, so we\u2019re playing with ancient varietals of different things, like tomatoes that haven\u2019t been grown in over a century, different kinds of peppers, things like that, just to see if it\u2019s possible.\u201d Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742563713.1617143}
