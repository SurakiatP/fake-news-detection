[Maischak teaches America History at the university.  His February 17 tweet speaks for itself: To save American democracy, Trump must hang.  The sooner and the higher, the better.  #TheResistance #DeathToFascism https:  .   \u2014   Lars Maischak (@LarsMaischak) February 18, 2017,    Other tweets on Maischak\u2019s profile demonstrate the ideology behind statements about Trump hanging and explain why universities across the country are now viewed with disdain by average,     Americans. Here is another tweet from Maischak, dated March 8: Don\u2019t tell me to \u201dobey the Law.\u201d  \u201dThe Law\u201d in this country is one part Racism, one part Class Oppression, all Capitalism. #TheResistance,  \u2014   Lars Maischak (@LarsMaischak) March 8, 2017,  And another dates March 3: Judging from the largely absent facial markings this year, Christianity is paying the price for its pact with Fascism.  Students abandon it.  \u2014   Lars Maischak (@LarsMaischak) March 4, 2017,  This is today\u2019s academia. These are types of voices hired to teach recent high school graduates American History. How do you think George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson fare when taught by one who sees the world in this way? How do you think America\u2019s   heritage fares?
