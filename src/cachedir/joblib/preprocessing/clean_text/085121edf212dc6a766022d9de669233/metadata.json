Both films were directed by James Cameron, who later featured him in more   roles: as a   salesman who cheated Jamie Lee Curtis\u2019s character in \u201cTrue Lies\u201d (1994) and as the   scientist who salvaged the wreck of the ocean liner in \u201cTitanic\u201d (1997). He also starred in Ron Howard\u2019s   film \u201cApollo 13\u201d (1995) portraying Fred Haise, one of three astronauts on a mission to the moon that experienced serious mechanical problems, and in \u201cTwister\u201d (1996) as a  .

William Paxton was born on May 17, 1955, in Fort Worth, the son of the former Mary Lou Gray and John Lane Paxton, a businessman and sometime actor. When he was 8, Bill and his brother, Bob, were taken by their father to see President John F. Kennedy on the morning of Nov. 22, 1963, in Fort Worth, hours before his assassination in Dallas. \u201cI remember just a really euphoric crowd,\u201d he recalled in a 2013 interview. \u201cI was a bit young to really understand later the consequences of the event. \u201d There is a photograph of Mr. Paxton from that morning, perched on a stranger\u2019s shoulders. He graduated from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth and moved to Los Angeles the next year to break into the film industry, finding jobs as a production assistant and set dresser. At 21 he enrolled in New York University, where he studied with the acting teacher Stella Adler, but dropped out after two years to return to Los Angeles to pursue acting there. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any point in a degree,\u201d he told Texas Monthly. \u201cI didn\u2019t see where I\u2019d be filling that in on an application for any kind of job. \u201d Mr. Paxton\u2019s survivors include his wife of more than 30 years, Louise Newbury and two children, James and Lydia. Long before his role in \u201cBig Love,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Paxton was   in assessing his status in Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s always a little frustrating when you\u2019re reading a script after 10 guys ahead of you have had a chance to pick it over,\u201d he said in 1998. \u201cYou can almost see the bread crumbs. I haven\u2019t had a role that\u2019s propelled me into major stardom. Sure, I\u2019ve had roles that put me on the playing field. A lot of base hits. No home runs. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564424.7006404}
