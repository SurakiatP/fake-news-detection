The answer, at least according to the Nikkei, is the latter.\\nAs the Japanese owner of the Financial Times reports , China is on a shopping spree, and has been \u201cgobbling\u201d up Japanese government bonds, adding that Beijing bought close to a net 9 trillion yen ($86.6 billion) worth of JGBs in the January-August period, more than tripling the amount from the same period last year. Incidentally that\u2019s almost equivalent to the number of US Treasurys sold by China.\\nA simple explanation for the shift is that the People\u2019s Bank of China has been reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasurys in anticipation of higher U.S. interest rates and shifting some of its money to JGBs, where higher rates \u2013 courtesy of 250% in debt/GDP \u2013 are largely guaranteed to never arrive.\\nBut more importantly, and this could explain the perplexing recent strength in the Yuan, this trend may be a reason behind the yen\u2019s appreciation in foreign exchange markets in recent months .\\nAccording to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance, China invested 8.9 trillion yen in Japanese securities in net terms between January and August. Buying started to exceed selling more often on a monthly basis in the second half of 2015. In April, net buying surpassed 3 trillion yen. Curiously, China is not buying the Japanese bonds for the \u201cyield\u201d, but rather for liquidity: most of the securities purchased by the PBOC are bonds with maturities of one year or less.\\nJudging by the latest TIC data, China\u2019s selling of US paper is accelerating, which also suggests that just as China has been a factor pushing the Yuan higher, the dollar has been pressured lower by the ongoing Chinese liquidation. One wonders how much higher the USD will jump if and when China decides to halt its selling of US paper, and how much lower the Yuan will then tumble in response, leading to even faster capital outflows from China.\\nSource: Zero Hedge \\n'"}, "time": 1742564283.0583093}
