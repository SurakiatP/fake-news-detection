[The call with Russian president Vladimir Putin was closely watched on both sides of the Atlantic, as Presidents Trump and Putin discussed such topics as stabilizing relations, restoring trade ties, the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, and situations in Ukraine and the Koreas, CNN reported.  The call with Putin comes after both presidents recently expressed desires to strengthen relations after a series of sanctions were lowered on Russia during the Obama years. The Russian statement on Trump\u2019s call did not mention if Obama\u2019s sanctions were discussed. President Trump also spoke to Japanese leader Shinzo Abe about the U. S. pulling out of the   Partnership, a   trade deal that Abe supported. The president reportedly told Abe that he was more interested in bilateral trade deals that were easier to manage and alter as the situation demands, the Washington Times said. The pair arranged a meeting in Washington for next month. In his conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the White House said Trump and Merkel agreed on the \u201cfundamental importance\u201d of NATO and made plans for an   visit in the near future, voanews. com noted. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull described his conversation with the U. S. leader as frank, constructive, and practical, Australia\u2019s ABC reported. \u201cWe discussed the vital importance of the United States\u2019 continued strong presence in our region,\u201d Turnbull told his nation. \u201cWe agreed that presence has been an absolutely essential foundation of the peace and stability that has enabled the remarkable growth and prosperity  \u2014   the remarkable economic growth we have seen over the last 40 years,\u201d the Australian leader added. President Trump is also set to speak to French President Francois Hollande, a leader who has been sharply critical of the newly elected American leader. In past calls, the pair discussed ISIS, climate change, and the situation in Ukraine, according to Agence  . But Hollande has made a series of critical statements about Trump since the early November call. For instance, at the end of January, Hollande insisted Europe must oppose Trump with a \u201cfirm\u201d response, and only days ago Hollande said Trump would be a \u201cchallenge\u201d for Europe\u2019s leaders.
