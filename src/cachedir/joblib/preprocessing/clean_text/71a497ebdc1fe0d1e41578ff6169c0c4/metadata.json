(AP) - A federal jury has found Ammon Bundy and his six co-defendants not guilty on all charges for taking over a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon earlier this year. \\n\u2026 \\nLed by Bundy, the defendants were part of a group that occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge last winter. They were charged with conspiring to impede Interior Department employees from doing their jobs, through force, threat or intimidation. \\nThe defendants said they were engaging in a peaceful protest, pressing their case against federal control of Western lands and the imprisonment of two ranchers convicted of setting fires. \\nThe jury was also deciding whether four of them are guilty of possessing a firearm in a federal facility. Two defendants, Ryan Bundy and Kenneth Medenbach, were charged with theft of government property. \\nOne juror was dismissed during deliberations and an alternate was brought in. The jury was in its fourth day of deliberations when Judge Anna Brown asked them for a verdict. \\n\"A very quick verdict almost always means a verdict for the government,\" said Medenbach\\'s attorney, Matthew Schindler. \\n\"The level of deliberation that\\'s been undertaken in this case means we have jurors who are very interested in applying the burden of proof and making sure a complicated allegation of conspiracy has actually been proved in this case. It\\'s not as simple as showing that people were at the refuge.\" \\nMarcus Mumford, Ammon Bundy\\'s attorney was taken into custody by US Marshals following his repeated claim that his client was free to go. Several people claimed he was tased , while others alleged he was tackled. \\nJohn Lamb released a video of emotional reaction to the verdict. \\nPosted by John Lamb on Thursday, October 27, 2016 \\nOthers reacted similarly.'"}, "time": 1742562878.9281538}
