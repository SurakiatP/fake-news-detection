Your very own instant baking mix of sorts that just needs water added? \\nThen you need some bannock! \\nLike hardtack , bannock has a long history. It\u2019s believed to have been brought to North America by Scottish explorers. In Scotland, bannock was cooked over an open fire on a bannock stone. \\nOnce in North America, the love of bannock spread quickly. Indigenous tribes from coast to coast adapted the method and created their own versions of this survival food. \\nToday, many outdoor enthusiasts rely on bannock to accompany their meals. It\u2019s easy to prepare before heading out, and simple to cook over a campfire. This portability makes bannock a wonderful addition to your survival stores. \\nThe ingredients of bannock are very similar to those of hardtack. Like hardtack, you can make a simple bannock out of just flour and water. However, to get the best tasting bannock, you\u2019ll want to add a few additional ingredients. \\nA Variety of Bannock Recipes \\nThere are bannock recipes with just two ingredients, and others with a lot more. At the heart of every bannock batch is flour . \\nThe Scotts traditionally used oat flour. As the recipe grew in popularity in North America, corn meal and wheat flour were used. Obliviously, bannock works with a variety of flours. So use what your body can tolerate, and what you can easily store . \\nBesides water and flour, you can add some additional items to improve the taste of your bannock. Here are a few common additions, and how much to use of each. \\nTo keep your bannock light instead of dense, add baking powder to your flour. A teaspoon for every cup of flour is an appropriate amount. Adding salt improves the flavor of the final product. Use \u00bd teaspoon of salt for every cup of flour. \\nCutting a tablespoon of fat for every cup of flour into the dry ingredients helps improve the taste and texture of your bannock. If you use a shelf-stable fat like lard or shortening, you\u2019ll still be able to store your dry mix for several months at a time. \\nYou can adapt the recipe to use what you have on hand, which makes this bread an ideal survival food. Here\u2019s how I tweaked the recipe. It created a flavorful bread when baked, pan-fried, or cooked over an open fire. \\nFor each batch, you\u2019ll need: 1 cup of white wheat flour 1 tsp. baking powder 1 TSB. unrefined coconut oil \\nYou\u2019ll also need some water when you\u2019re ready to cook the bannock. \\nBegin by preparing the dry ingredients. I mixed them in a small bowl, and used a fork to incorporate the oil. My end mixture looked a lot like commercial Bisquick or other baking mixes. \\nOnce you\u2019ve prepared your bannock mix, you can store each batch in a sealable bag. Throw a couple of these bags into your bug out bag , along with a bottle of water, so you can always be ready to make bread. \\nHere\u2019s a picture of a bag of bannock mix I made, along with a bottle of water and a green stick. All I need is a fire and I can have freshly made bread! Since each batch doesn\u2019t take much water, that single water bottle is enough to make a couple of bags. \\nHow to Cook Bannock \\nThe ingredients aren\u2019t the only thing you can vary when making bannock. This bread can be cooked in several ways. \\nNo matter how you cook it, you\u2019ll need to add water to your mix. Just pour in a little water into the bag, and start gently squeezing the bag. You\u2019ll distribute the water throughout the mix. \\nThe dough will begin to form a soft ball. If your mix is too dry, add a tiny bit more water. It\u2019s much better to add the water slowly than to add too much. Once your dough is a soft sticky ball, stop working it. You\u2019ll make the bannock tough if you handle it too much. \\nHere\u2019s a picture of what my dough looked like when it was ready to go. \\nThere\u2019s many ways to cook your bannock. Here are three popular methods: \\nPan Fry \\nHeat a little bit of oil in a cast iron skillet. Once water droplets dance, it\u2019s time to add your bannock. You can just squeeze it directly from the bag to the pan. Or you can break it into smaller pieces to speed up the cooking. That\u2019s what I did. \\nLet it cook a couple of minutes, shaking the pan gently. Once the bannock comes loose from the bottom of your pan, it\u2019s time to flip. \\nYou can either grab a spatula like I did, or grab the frying pan tightly and toss your bannock in the air. It\u2019ll flip over and you can catch it. Then cook the other side. \\nBake in an Oven \\nIn a survival situation, you probably won\u2019t have a traditional oven. But if you have a solar oven set up, or are just making bannock for supper, you can bake it. \\nBefore putting it in the oven, dump your prepared bag out onto a greased pan. Then flatten it out a bit with your hands. \\nI baked my bannock at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes. It came out nicely browned, and cooked all the way through. Here\u2019s a picture showing pan fried bannock (the small ones) and baked bannock. \\nOver an Open Fire \\nIf you\u2019re in the wilderness, find yourself a green stick from a tree. You\u2019ll want to strip the bark from the end you\u2019ll cook the bannock on. \\nYou\u2019ll also need a fire . Similarly to roasting marshmallows, you\u2019ll want a fire that has plenty of hot coals. That way the bannock cooks all the way without burning on the outside. \\nTo prep your stick, hold the peeled end of the stick over the coals for a couple of minutes. This will heat the stick and help the dough to cook on the inside. \\nWhen you\u2019re stick is hot, it\u2019s time to wrap your dough around it. Just pretend the dough is playdough and make it into a long snake. Then, wrap the snake around the peeled portion of the stick. Remember it\u2019s hot, so be careful! You want the dough to be thin on your stick so it can cook. \\nHere\u2019s what my wrapped stick looked like. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, just as long as it\u2019s on tight enough not to fall off while over the fire. \\nIt took me a couple of tries to get my bannock cooked correctly, and not burn it. Then I discovered it was very similar to roasting a marshmallow, and adjusted the distance from the coals accordingly. \\nIt should take a couple minutes to cook. When I thought it was done, I pulled my bannock away from the fire and broke off a little piece to test the center. After the center was no longer doughy, it was ready to eat. \\nHere\u2019s my finished fire roasted bannock on a stick. The kids thought it\u2019d make a fun hot dog bun substitute the next time we have a cookout. I agree. \\nAdd-In Ideas \\nWe just tore this bannock into pieces to eat. But, you don\u2019t have to eat your bannock plain. You can doctor up the final product with butter, jam, cheese, or some meat. \\nYou can also stir many different ingredients into your dough to mix it up a bit. If you\u2019d like a sweeter bannock, consider adding a teaspoon of sugar into your dry ingredient mix. Honey would also be a good sweetener, added at the same time as the water. \\nYou can also add some shelf-stable ingredients to your dry mix that\u2019ll add some texture and flavor to your bread. Here are some ideas to try. You can either use a single add-in, or make up your own favorite combination. Chopped, dried fruit Spices (such as cinnamon or nutmeg) Seeds Mini chocolate chips \\nStoring Your Bannock \\nThe shelf life of your bannock mix will depend on what ingredients you include, and how you store it. A basic mix with flour, baking powder, salt, and oil will last at least a couple of months when stored in a sealed plastic baggie. If you remove the oil, the mix would have a longer shelf-life. \\nMixing up a batch of bannock mix takes just a couple of minutes. You won\u2019t have a large time-commitment ensuring you always have a fresh batch on hand. \\nIf you\u2019re storing plastic baggies in your bug out bag, or even just for a camping trip, be sure that they aren\u2019t going to get punctured. You might consider keeping the smaller bags inside a stronger, larger freezer bag to offer more protection. \\nOnce your bannock is cooked, you can keep it for several days. That means you can cook up a big batch and use it to help give you strength if you\u2019re on the move to another bug out location . You\u2019ll notice the texture will change a bit as the bannock dries out, but it\u2019ll still taste fine. \\nWant to learn how our Grandparents survived through the Great Depression?
