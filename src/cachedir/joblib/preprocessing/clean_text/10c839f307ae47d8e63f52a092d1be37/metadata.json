Gorsuch, though Republicans still face the difficult task of gaining enough Democratic votes to confirm Judge Gorsuch without potentially having to change longstanding Senate practice. The senator, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, is among a group of 10 Democratic senators who represent states that voted for Mr. Trump and who are up for   in 2018. So far, two others  \u2014   Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  \u2014   have announced their support for Judge Gorsuch. That leaves Republicans, who hold 52 seats in the Senate, five Democratic votes short of breaking any filibuster mounted by Democrats. If the Republicans do not have enough votes to break a filibuster, they could invoke the   nuclear option, allowing them to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees and hold a floor vote. Judge Gorsuch could then be confirmed by a simple majority. Mr. Donnelly said in a statement that he would vote for Judge Gorsuch because \u201che is a qualified jurist who will base his decision on his understanding of the law and is well respected among his peers. \u201d Mr. Donnelly said he believed that the Senate should keep the   threshold to end a filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, said on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that he planned to decide Tuesday or Wednesday how he would vote. \u201cI think the   margin requires some level of bipartisanship, and whether it\u2019s on legislation or a major appointment like this, that it isn\u2019t bad for the country that you have to have people and ideas that have some level of   from both parties,\u201d he said. But Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana  \u2014   a state won by Mr. Trump  \u2014   said Sunday evening that he would oppose Judge Gorsuch, dealing a big blow to Republicans\u2019 hopes of reaching 60 votes. The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote for Monday on whether to send Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Senate floor. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that Judge Gorsuch would be confirmed this week. \u201cHow that happens really depends on our Democratic friends, how many of them are willing to oppose cloture on a partisan basis to kill a Supreme Court nominee  \u2014   never happened before in history, the whole history of the country,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, said on the same program that Republicans would not secure 60 votes. \u201cSo instead of changing the rules, which is up to Mitch McConnell and the Republican majority, why doesn\u2019t President Trump, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate sit down and try to come up with a mainstream nominee?\u201d Mr. Schumer said. Mr. McConnell said any change to the precedent on filibustering Supreme Court nominees would not endanger the filibuster that can be used for legislation, calling it \u201ca longstanding tradition of the Senate. \u201d Another Senate Republican leader, John Cornyn of Texas, defended Mr. McConnell\u2019s approach. \u201cIf they filibuster Neil Gorsuch, they are going to filibuster everyone that this president might propose,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said on \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d referring to Democrats. \u201cThey realize that this is their last gasp to try to prevent him from being confirmed. But they won\u2019t. \u201d Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri  \u2014   a state that voted for Mr. Trump  \u2014   announced Friday that she would oppose Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. Ms. McCaskill published a post on Medium in which she described the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d she faced. \u201cI am not comfortable with either choice,\u201d she wrote, but then added: \u201cI cannot support Judge Gorsuch because a study of his opinions reveal a rigid ideology that always puts the little guy under the boot of corporations. He is evasive, but his body of work isn\u2019t. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561912.566405}
