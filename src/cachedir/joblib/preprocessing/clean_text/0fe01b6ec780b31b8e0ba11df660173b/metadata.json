Ryan left the White House briefing room on Tuesday, she was already making headlines: on live television, President Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean M. Spicer, had cut off her questions to chastise her for what he deemed an inappropriate shake of her head. In Ms. Ryan\u2019s basement office in the West Wing, the phone started to ring. Her fans, it seemed, were having none of it. \u201cI was appalled at the way Sean Spicer was treating you with such disrespect,\u201d said a   woman named Pam, who said she had listened to Ms. Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, for years. \u201cI have people come at me in all sorts of ways,\u201d Ms. Ryan told Pam, nodding. \u201cI thank you so much. \u201d Hanging up, Ms. Ryan, whose workspace is about the size of a telephone booth, checked her Twitter account. After Mr. Spicer\u2019s harangue, she had tweeted a single word  \u2014   \u201cLawd! !!!\u201d  \u2014   which was rapidly going viral. (By week\u2019s end, it would be retweeted more than 6, 000 times.) Somebody had replied with a video of Melissa McCarthy imitating Mr. Spicer on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d by shoving a lectern at a reporter. Ms. Ryan howled with delight. \u201cI love Melissa McCarthy!\u201d she said. One of the few black journalists in the White House press corps, Ms. Ryan has covered presidents and clashed with press secretaries for 20 years. But her encounters with the Trump administration are propelling the      journalist to a new level of prominence  \u2014   and into a contentious debate over this White House\u2019s attitudes toward gender and race. First there was Mr. Trump\u2019s bizarre request, at a February news conference, that Ms. Ryan arrange a meeting between him and the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201cAre they friends of yours?\u201d the president asked, apparently oblivious to the racial undertones of posing such a query to a black journalist. Then came Tuesday, when Mr. Spicer laced into Ms. Ryan after she asked how the administration planned to revamp its image in light of reports about suspicious ties with Russia. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019re hellbent on trying to make sure that whatever image you want to tell about this White House stays,\u201d Mr. Spicer shot back from the lectern, after accusing Ms. Ryan of harboring an \u201cagenda. \u201d When Ms. Ryan tried to clarify, he interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me a question and I\u2019m going to answer it,\u201d he said, adding in a tone: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, please stop shaking your head again. \u201d Mr. Spicer is belligerent on the best of days. But his tone toward Ms. Ryan struck some viewers  \u2014   including Hillary Clinton  \u2014   as pointed and condescending, particularly because it was directed toward a black woman. \u201cApril Ryan, a respected journalist with unrivaled integrity, was doing her job just this afternoon in the White House press room, when she was patronized and cut off trying to ask a question,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told a women\u2019s group in California. (Mrs. Clinton, who has sat for interviews with Ms. Ryan, saw the exchange on Twitter that day and added the line to her speech.) The hashtag #BlackWomenatWork trended on Twitter, linking Ms. Ryan with Representative Maxine Waters of California, whose hairstyle was mocked by the Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly (he later apologized). Whoopi Goldberg expressed her disgust on \u201cThe View. \u201d John Dingell, the former Democratic representative from Michigan, wrote on Twitter: \u201cIf the WH doesn\u2019t want talented journalists like @AprilDRyan to shake their heads, perhaps they should stop acting like some damn children. \u201d For Ms. Ryan, the attention is energizing, and a bit unsettling. She posted supportive comments from fans and celebrities on her Twitter feed, but also some of the racist replies that she says are a byproduct of her job. When a Florida radio host requested a photo with her at the White House  \u2014   \u201cI just love the way you don\u2019t take no for an answer\u201d  \u2014   Ms. Ryan politely declined. \u201cIt\u2019s going to look like I\u2019m gloating,\u201d she said. \u201cLook, I\u2019m a black woman in a white male dominated town,\u201d Ms. Ryan said later, when asked if she felt treated differently. But she said her primary goal was to remain focused on her work. \u201cI like Sean Spicer,\u201d Ms. Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to hurt him. \u201d She paused. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to hurt me, either. \u201d By turns serious and ebullient, Ms. Ryan\u2019s dispatches reach about 400 radio stations around the country, most with a primarily   audience. This is not her first time in the spotlight. Barack Obama\u2019s first press secretary, Robert Gibbs, once tried to cut off her questions about a botched state dinner by instructing Ms. Ryan to \u201ccalm down,\u201d adding, \u201cThis happens with my son, he does the same thing. \u201d The remark, widely circulated on cable news, prompted groans and glares from fellow journalists. \u201cShe is a force, and you really have to be a force when you are an   woman in one of the clubbiest rooms in the country, the White House press briefing room,\u201d said Jonathan Capehart, the Washington Post opinion writer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be tough, especially to be in that room for 20 years. \u201d When Mr. Trump, at his news conference, tried to deputize Ms. Ryan as a liaison with black lawmakers, Mr. Capehart recalled thinking: \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d \u201cDoes he think that all black people know each other and she\u2019s going to go run off and set up a meeting for him?\u201d Mr. Capehart said. Adding of Ms. Ryan, \u201cWhen she is belittled, she rises above it. \u201d Mr. Spicer has clashed with numerous journalists in the briefing room  \u2014   men and women  \u2014   and this week he described himself as \u201ckind of astonished\u201d that his    with Ms. Ryan was singled out. \u201cApril is a tough reporter who knows how to throw it out and take it back,\u201d Mr. Spicer said in an interview with the radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cBut to suggest that somehow because of her gender or race she is treated differently, I think, is frankly demeaning to her. \u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m treating April Ryan with the same pushback that I would any other reporter in that room. \u201d Ms. Ryan joined   American Urban Radio Networks in 1997 to cover the White House, after reporting at local stations in Baltimore and Tennessee. At first, she sat in the back of the West Wing briefing room, among the more obscure news outlets. Over the years, she made her way forward, sometimes taking the chairs of   reporters and eventually securing her current seat in the third row. She has published two books, \u201cThe Presidency in Black and White\u201d and, last year, \u201cAt Mama\u2019s Knee,\u201d a look at motherhood and race. (Ms. Ryan is a single mother of two daughters.) Her purview is general politics, but she often pursues questions germane to a black audience, a rarity in a press room where white men are the majority. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, if she doesn\u2019t ask the   questions, they may never get asked,\u201d said Jerry Lopes, president of program operations at Ms. Ryan\u2019s network. After Mr. Spicer\u2019s remarks on Tuesday, Ms. Ryan was greeted by reporters with smiles and a rousing \u201cHey troublemaker!\u201d from a passing cameraman. Asked who might play her on \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d Ms. Ryan burst out laughing, started to dismiss the idea, then allowed that she was a fan of Taraji P. Henson, who plays Cookie on \u201cEmpire. \u201d In January, Ms. Ryan was spotted outside Mr. Spicer\u2019s office, giving him a hard time about one of his answers. Mr. Spicer, who had taken pains to call on Ms. Ryan that day, was incredulous. \u201cHow many times did you get called on in the Obama administration?\u201d he asked. \u201cNow and again,\u201d Ms. Ryan replied, slyly. The day after the   incident, Mr. Spicer walked into the briefing room and conspicuously called on Ms. Ryan first. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d he asked with a smile from the lectern. \u201cI\u2019m fine, and how are you?\u201d Ms. Ryan replied, drawing laughter. \u201cFantastic,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. And then Ms. Ryan moved on to the news of the day.'"}, "time": 1742628494.63314}
