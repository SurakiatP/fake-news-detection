We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. \\nAfter all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. \\nBecause of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. \\nAn email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: \u201cWestern intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region\u201d to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of \u201cproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.\u201d Citing the need to \u201cuse our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,\u201d said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were \u201cimportant to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.\u201d Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary\u2019s largest donations come from those two countries. She Is Funded By Nations That Fund ISIS. Coincidence? \\nIn another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai , set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 \u201cbirthday check.\u201d \\nThe email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would \u201cwelcome [the Clinton Foundation\u2019s] suggestions for investments in Haiti \u2014 particularly on education and health.\u201d Desai added that while Qatar had already \u201callocated most of their $20 million \u2026 [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.\u201d Bill Clinton gets $1M from Qatar for his birthday. FYI: It's legal and common practice in Qatar for husbands to beat and rape their wives. pic.twitter.com/oGM2Z9JrVl \\n\u2014 Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 13, 2016 \\nWe now see two more examples of the Clinton\u2019s acting corrupt and being intertwined with nations that fund ISIS. \\nFor those that do not see where the dots connect, let\u2019s simplify how this all worked for Hillary. \\nHillary, as Secretary of State, would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her \u201cfoundation.\u201d These weapons, provided by Hillary and her State Department, then filtered down from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, and so on to create, supply, and bolster terrorist groups. \\nThat is exactly how ISIS was created. But instead of blowing them up with an air assault, Hillary and Obama decided to leave ISIS alone. Why? Because ISIS being in the Middle East allows the Obama/Clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons. \\nThey are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group. Let that sink in. Why else have they not arrested Hillary for all of these crimes? The FBI would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to Facebook right now to praise Allah and ISIS. \\nIt also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence Julian Assange. If Julian Assange is lying, why are they trying so hard to silence him? \\n\u2014 Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 23, 2016 \\nThe media remains silent on all of this. This would be plastered all over the news for months if a President Trump was exposed for this. \\nIgnorant politicians are not the problem. The problem is that ignorant people keep voting for them every election. This is the exact reason we desperately need change in this country, and it starts with Donald Trump. \\nPeople like Julian Assange have given up their lives to expose corruption in government and allowing Hillary Clinton to win this election makes all of his sacrifices meaningless. \\nHe has offered us a chance to revolt against our tyrannical government. Chances likes this do not occur often, and if we do not seize the opportunity, we will suffer another four years of suppression from our corrupt leaders. \\nVote Trump, so that we can save America and he can pardon Julian Assange. \""}, "time": 1742628351.7470553}
