Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem and Ramon Vilalta on Wednesday became the first team of three to be selected for the prize, which will be awarded in Tokyo on May 20. \u201cTheir intensely collaborative way of working together, where the creative process, commitment to vision and all responsibilities are shared equally, led to the selection of the three individuals for this year\u2019s award,\u201d Thomas J. Pritzker, the chairman of Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the award, said in a statement, adding, \u201cMr. Aranda, Ms. Pigem and Mr. Vilalta have had an impact on the discipline far beyond their immediate area. \u201d Ms. Pigem, who spoke for the group because her English is strongest, said in a telephone interview that the collaboration was integral to the practice. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s very important to work together  \u2014   one of the most important things we talk about is shared creativity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of one person it\u2019s all three. Sometimes we say six hands, one voice. \u201d The architects are not widely known they have not designed major public projects or worked much outside Spain. But they came to the attention of the Pritzker jury because their works, if modest, \u201cadmirably and poetically fulfill the traditional requirements of architecture for physical and spatial beauty along with function and craftsmanship,\u201d the citation said. \u201cBut what sets them apart is their approach that creates buildings and places that are both local and universal at the same time. \u201d The team\u2019s buildings include the Soulages Museum, in Rodez, France, featuring boldly modern metallic architecture (in collaboration with G. Tr\u00e9gou\u00ebt, 2014) and a   complex in Barcelona, Spain (Sant Antoni  \u2014   Joan Oliver, 2007) that incorporates a library, a center for the elderly and a children\u2019s playground. The design features ample views of interior gardens and sky, and metal corridors that nod to the site\u2019s industrial past as a candy factory. They also continue to work on projects in their Catalonian home turf, like the   athletics track, completed in 2000, and the covered   Les Cols restaurant in 2011, with plastic walls of trees, between which real trees grow. In 1988, one year after completing their studies in architecture at the School of Architecture in Vall\u00e8s, the three won first prize in a competition sponsored by the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Urbanism, to design a lighthouse in Punta Aldea. \u201cWe said, O. K.,\u201d Ms. Pigem said. \u201cMaybe we can do something good in architecture. \u201d They founded their firm that year, calling it RCR Arquitectes, after the initials of their first names. For the lighthouse, they had pondered \u201cthe essence of the typology,\u201d according to their Pritzker biography. The team members have brought a   sensibility to their built projects, as well as their work as consultant architects to the natural park in the volcanic zone of La Garrotxa. \u201cFor us, what is very, very important is the relationship to the site,\u201d Ms. Pigem said. \u201cIf the site is natural, or if the site is a building, or if the site is a city. What is important is to study the strong and unique relationship between the existing and the new. \u201d In 2007, they converted an    foundry into their office, Barber\u00ed Laboratory. They are the second Pritzker laureates to come from Spain Rafael Moneo received the award in 1996. Ms. Pigem, who is married to Mr. Vilalta, said she and her colleagues \u201cfeel very excited and very joyful. \u201d The Pritzker jury said it was important to reward a local firm in an increasingly globalized world. \u201cMore and more people fear that because of this international influence,\u201d the citation said, \u201cwe will lose our local values, our local art and our local customs. \u201d \u201cThey help us to see, in a most beautiful and poetic way, that the answer to the question is not \u2018 \u2019 and that we can, at least in architecture, aspire to have both,\u201d it continued, \u201cour roots firmly in place and our arms outstretched to the rest of the world. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562792.5273066}
