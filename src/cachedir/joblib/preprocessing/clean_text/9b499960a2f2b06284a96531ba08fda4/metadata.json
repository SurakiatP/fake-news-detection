He exhibited the ability to forward his intent with grace and intelligence. The candidate seeking election for the Assembly District 8 (AD8) seat. Ross discussed his passion for the people of Nevada and the state\u2019s need for change.\\nImmigration, Refugees, and Non-English Speaking Students He believes that dealing with illegal immigration and closing the borders should be a priority. Clark County schools are impacted with a high percentage of immigrant children, and for many of them, English is not their primary language. In 2013, statistics indicated that 44 percent of the students were of Hispanic decent, according to Las Vegas Review-Journal.\\nOne solution to the overabundance of non-English speaking students would be to have a separate school to focus on learning the language, says Ross. In fact, school officials state the situation has been identified as a problem because they have been working toward the improvement of student performance. With the number of Hispanic students increasing, \u201cthe challenges they bring to the district, according to state test results and graduation rates show them lagging behind other student groups.\u201d\\nMoreover, Ross is adamantly against allowing any refugees residence in Nevada. He would not support legislation which would admit them to the state.\\nVoter I.D. Reform Proper voter identification is a must to keep elections honest and above board. In Nevada, there are multiple ways an eligible citizen can register to vote:\\nSocial services agencies and the Department of Motor Vehicles provide forms. A person can go to the County Clerk or Registrar Offices and file. Nevada is one of at least 29 states that allow online registration. Ross feels that the use of the internet to register to vote should not be allowed. He says that a person should be required to the to the state\u2019s registrar with either a birth certificate or passport. This, he adds, would prevent anyone from registering more than once using alternative names.\\nVeterans Services For a veteran to receive medical services they are required to use providers at the VA hospital and clinics. However, Ross would like to see this change. He supports veterans being allowed to find their own doctors, and the VA insurance should cover the bills.\\nAn anecdote shared by Ross demonstrates the VA\u2019s inefficiency. He said the VA facilities were closed and moved one location, which makes it difficult for the veterans. Furthermore, veterans are often assigned to a nurse practitioner rather than a physician, which they deserve.\\nOur veterans are heroes, and we must, as a society, begin treating them as such. They put their lives on the line to protect us and our freedoms and keeping the homeland safe.\\nNorm Ross Cares About Nevada On his website, Ross discusses all of the issues he intends to support and work toward a resolution. They are; repealing the Commerce Tax, keeping property taxes low, and allowing families to send their children the school they choose.\\nCommerce Tax \u2013 Contrary to what big government liberals claim, Nevada residents and businesses are not under-taxed, and our state government is not underfunded. The Commerce Tax passed in 2015 will only hurt businesses in Nevada and cause more job loss. Property Taxes \u2013 Increasing property taxes will only burden our seniors and families already struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. Additionally, it will have an adverse effect on new home construction causing more loss of good paying jobs. School Choice \u2013 The Education Savings Accounts (ESA) legislation passed in 2015 is a great start allowing school choice for all students. We can and should strengthen access to these accounts. Ending Civil Forfeiture \u2013 These laws, which allow law enforcement to seize and keep property without filing charges or securing criminal convictions, are an assault on the people\u2019s due process and private property rights. Nevada must abolish this unfair practice and ensure that only convicted criminals and not innocent Nevadans, lose their assets to forfeiture. Ross proclaims that once he is elected to the Assembly on November 8, he intends to introduce legislation to rectify these issues in Nevada.\\nBy Cathy Mine\\nSources:\\nInterview: October 13, 2016, with Norm Ross\\nElect Norm Ross: Website \u2013 Issues\\nLas Vegas Review-Journal: Clark County School District enrollment grows, with Hispanics leading the trend\\nBallotpedia: Public Policy in Nevada\\nTop and Featured Image Courtesy of David Stanley\u2019s  \\nInset Images Courtesy of Norm Ross \u2013 Used With Permission    #CMJournalist , AD8 , ross , schools , veterans'"}, "time": 1742563614.629925}
