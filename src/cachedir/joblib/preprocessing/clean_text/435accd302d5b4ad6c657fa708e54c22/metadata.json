It comes as the Russian envoy to NATO has warned that the Western alliance\u2019s buildup could be harmful for other countries\u2019 security. On Monday, 680 personnel from 32 NATO states and partner countries, including Georgia, Albania, Israel and Ukraine, started a series of joint exercises known as Crna Gora (Montenegro) 2016. Between October 31 and November 4, multinational teams will participate in a number of scenarios simulating various disasters such as floods and chemical spills. \u201cThis is an opportunity to work with them [NATO] during the four-day exercise to determine our capacity and the capabilities of our response to natural disasters, as well as to recognize our weaknesses and eliminate them in time,\u201d said Montenegro\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and former intelligence chief Dusko Markovic, as quoted by the newspaper Vijesti. In December, NATO formally invited Montenegro to join the alliance, while in May it has been granted an observer status after accession negotiations. \u201cMontenegro has demonstrated the ability as a future member of NATO, not only through organizing this exercise, but also bearing its burden,\u201dMarkovic added. \u201cMontenegro has demonstrated the ability to not only willing to accept but also help realize partnership goals.\u201d Meanwhile in Serbia, 150 paratroopers from the reconnaissance battalion of the Ivanovo Airborne Division are to arrive in Belgrade to take part in the military exercise Slavic Brotherhood 2016. The Russian troops will be joined by Serbian and Belarusian forces. The joint Russian-Serbian exercise will last between November 2 and 15, and will also involve over 50 soldiers from the Russian Military Transport Aviation along with combat vehicles including the BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicle, the Tachyon drone and four ATVs for raids and reconnaissance missions. This would mark the second set of Slavic Brotherhood exercises with Serbia, with the first held last year near Novorossiysk. \u2018Undermining regional security\u2019 Russia\u2019s Permanent Representative to NATO, Aleksandr Grushko, said on Monday that NATO\u2019s buildup close to Russian territory could have a negative impact on the general security situation in the region. \u201cNATO\u2019s [systematic] efforts have been changing the very essence of the military security in the regions which are adjacent to the Russian border,\u201d Grushko said in an interview to Rossiya-24 channel which aired on Monday. \u201cThis seriously worsens the regional security and the security of those countries that participate in these drills and this activity,\u201dhe said, adding that NATO\u2019s ongoing military buildup in its eastern flank is \u201csome sort of project that not only does not correspond to the common European security interests, but goes against them.\u201d Reflecting on the earlier statements by NATO\u2019s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who said on Thursday that NATO did not want to get caught up in a new Cold War with Russia, Grushko pointed out that NATO has been sending mixed signals on purpose in a bid to justify its military buildup. \u201cI think it\u2019s a double signal. First of all, it\u2019s a signal to western public opinion that all NATO actions on its eastern flank are calibrated and do not transcend the framework of reasonable defense. Secondly, it\u2019s also an apparent attempt to send a signal to us, so that Russia will not react in what they believe to be an excessive and aggressive manner,\u201dhe said, adding: \u201cIn effect,\u201dNATO\u2019s increased military activity close to Russian borders is \u201cjustified by nothing.\u201d While Stoltenberg claimed that NATO aims \u201cto strive for a more cooperative and constructive relationship\u201d with Russia, in reality the alliance does not seem to maintain this approach, as evidenced by its recent refusal to discuss flight security in the Baltic Sea region, the Russian diplomat said. \u201cThe very fact that NATO\u2019s countries refused to convene for the meeting, proposed by us and to be held at the level of military experts in Moscow and devoted to all aspects of air traffic security in this region, speaks volumes,\u201d Grushko said, adding that NATO may not be that genuine in its attempt to improve air traffic security over the Baltic Sea. In July, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that Russia is ready to fly all its missions over the Baltic Sea with the transponders on, but only if NATO member states reciprocate. \u201cAs soon as we said about this, the issue of transponders practically disappeared from NATO member states\u2019 political lexicon. It ceased to exist\u2026 I\u2019m not sure that NATO is sincerely ready to talk about joining such a regime,\u201dhe concluded.'"}, "time": 1742628512.3828893}
