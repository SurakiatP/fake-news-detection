So on Monday, conservatives around the country got out the Make America Great Again hats, unfurled American flags and held rallies at state capitols and on courthouse steps, seeking to rekindle the populist fervor that helped vault Mr. Trump to the White House and stick up for a president whose approval ratings have taken a beating during five   weeks in office. But the modest crowds that showed up for the noontime rallies from New Jersey to Georgia to Colorado offered a reminder of what liberal groups learned eight years ago in the face of Tea Party anger at President Barack Obama: Stoking   energy is often easier for the outraged resistance than for the party pulling the levers in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of comments from the leftists about, \u2018Your crowd\u2019s not going to be as big as our crowd,\u2019\u201d said Betty Blanco, a retired teacher from La Junta, Colo. on the state\u2019s conservative eastern plains, who organized a rally on the steps of the   State Capitol. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a contest. \u201d About 150 Trump supporters turned out for Monday\u2019s rally in Denver, held just across the street from a park that had swelled with tens of thousands of protesters as part of the Women\u2019s March on Jan. 21. Organizers said Monday\u2019s rallies, held a day before the president addresses a joint session of Congress, bubbled up organically from Trump supporters who felt he was being treated unfairly by Democrats and the news media. Some people said the ferocity of that criticism had actually nudged them closer to Mr. Trump. \u201cI was mad at Trump for a while, absolutely,\u201d said Steve Foose, a bus driver in Middletown, N. J. and   former Democrat who joined about 200 people waving signs and flags along the curb of a   crossroads. \u201cI just grew to like him, and I would lay down my life for him. \u201d Monday\u2019s rallies were filled with prayer, choruses of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and speeches about cutting taxes and regulations. People applauded the president and veterans, and urged one another to stay positive. But there were also chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d every so often, and a few shouting matches when Trump critics wandered by and yelled at the crowds. People praised Mr. Trump for actions that have provoked protests and lawsuits from the left. In interviews at five rallies on Monday, his supporters said that he was breaking the china in Washington, cracking down on immigration and supporting American businesses, and that they were getting frustrated that more people did not seem to see it that way. In Atlanta, Jermane Enoch, 57, a project manager from Powder Springs, Ga. was among the few   in a largely white crowd of 200 who rallied on the president\u2019s behalf at Liberty Plaza, in the shadow of the State Capitol. Wearing a red Trump hat, a patriotic bow tie and a Trump   Mr. Enoch said that good businesspeople would understand why Monday\u2019s rallies across the country were needed, given what he said was the \u201cnegative messaging\u201d from   protesters and the news media. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to have a show of continuous support, just like it\u2019s necessary for businesses to show continuous improvement,\u201d he said. Mr. Enoch argued that the president had been mischaracterized and misunderstood. The idea that Mr. Trump is a racist, as some critics contend, struck him as balderdash. In a   turn at the microphone, Mr. Enoch said his support for Mr. Trump superseded race, and he urged a return to conservative values. Mr. Enoch brandished a pocket Constitution, to much applause. And he took a cue from Isaiah as he said Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters should not be cowed by counterprotest: \u201cI am not afraid!\u201d he said. \u201cNo weapon that is formed against us shall prosper!\u201d RICHARD FAUSSET In Mandeville, a city in one of Louisiana\u2019s most conservative parishes, there was some question as to how many Trump supporters would materialize, this being the usually quiet eve of Mardi Gras. But there was little doubt that those who showed up  \u2014   150 or so bikers, retirees,   police officers and others  \u2014   would be   in their support for a president who won the parish by roughly three to one. A home remodeler and disc jockey who uses the name Bobby Blaze made the most   entrance, wearing a suit over his leather \u201cBrotherhood of Bikers\u201d vest, a bright red tie with a gold clip and, to top it all off, a   Trump wig. He said that his father, a World War II veteran who died two years ago, would have loved Mr. Trump: \u201c\u2018The country needs John Wayne,\u2019 that\u2019s what he used to say. \u201d And after aiding its allies around the globe for decades, Mr. Blaze suggested, the United States had finally gotten such a   leader at a time when it needed him most. \u201cWe can\u2019t help the world,\u201d he said, \u201ctill we can help ourselves first. \u201d CAMPBELL ROBERTSON In Cabarrus County, N. C. which Mr. Trump easily carried, more than 150 of his supporters met up outside the courthouse in Concord, many of them unfurling last year\u2019s Trump campaign flags, lawn signs and red caps  \u2014   though a surprising number said they had never attended a Trump rally during the presidential race. Bill Cagle, a retiree, decided to attend on Monday after seeing a deluge of news coverage of   demonstrations in the streets and at congressional town halls. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve been silent long enough, and we\u2019ve really got to say what\u2019s in the heart,\u2019 when I saw all of this vitriol the last six weeks,\u201d Mr. Cagle said. An operations manager for a company that builds towers for   lines, Mr. Cagle said he was a registered Democrat but had not voted for the party\u2019s presidential ticket in decades. He said he maintained his registration only to vote against what he considered the worst option in a primary race. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done in a little bit of time, I think is great,\u201d he said of Mr. Trump, noting in particular his efforts to roll back regulations. \u201cI\u2019ve been in business, and by golly, if they can get rid of some of that, it\u2019s great. \u201d TRIP GABRIEL On the edges of the Denver crowd, two men exemplified the devotion and the dread that the president inspires. Ron Kamstra, a retired civil engineer and   Christian who said he deeply supported Mr. Trump\u2019s stances on terrorism and immigration, handed out photocopied passages of the Quran that he said encouraged violence. Mohamed Mashkooke, an accountant born in Somalia, wandered up to Mr. Kamstra and said he was growing increasingly worried about becoming the target of racist attacks  \u2014   like the shooting last week of two Indian men in Kansas. Cordially at first, but then increasingly tensely, the men argued about religion, immigration, faith and the validity of Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate. (Despite all of the facts, Mr. Kamstra is still dubious.) \u201cI don\u2019t hate Trump,\u201d Mr. Mashkooke said finally, walking away, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s crazy. \u201d \u201cO. K. good,\u201d Mr. Kamstra replied, and turned back to the speeches. JACK HEALY'"}, "time": 1742561632.4505787}
