In two Twitter posts early Wednesday morning, the president vowed to open an inquiry to reveal people who are registered to vote in multiple states or who remain on voting rolls long after they have died. \u201cWe have to understand where the problem exists, how deep it goes, and then suggest some remedies to it,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the president\u2019s press secretary. He said the White House would reveal more details this week. But voting officials in both parties across the country said the answer to those questions is already clear: Fraudulent voting happens in tiny, sporadic episodes that have no impact on the outcome of elections. It is virtually impossible, several state election officials said, that millions of people voted illegally in last year\u2019s presidential contest. In fact, that was the conclusion of Mr. Trump\u2019s own lawyers last year as they sought to stop recount efforts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \u201cAll available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote in their response to recount petitions by Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate. Mr. Spicer said the lawyers were referring only to states where Mr. Trump campaigned extensively. In Ohio, Secretary of State Jon A. Husted, a Republican, said Wednesday in an interview that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that voter fraud was happening on a large scale. Edgardo Cort\u00e9s, Virginia\u2019s election chief, a Democrat, said there was \u201cno basis\u201d for the claims. And California\u2019s Democratic secretary of state lashed out at the president for undermining confidence in the election system. \u201cFree and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and he\u2019s taken a jackhammer to it with his irresponsible tweets,\u201d said Alex Padilla, the state\u2019s top election official. \u201cWhatever proof or evidence he said he had, he clearly didn\u2019t have. His allegations since November are clearly lies, not alternative facts. \u201d Mr. Trump has repeatedly shifted his view of the election system. As a candidate, he frequently railed against what he called a \u201crigged\u201d election. When he became   he complained about \u201cserious voter fraud,\u201d but later reversed himself and mocked Ms. Stein\u2019s recount efforts as \u201ca scam\u201d and a waste of time and money. This week, he   again, telling lawmakers at a White House reception that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote because millions of immigrants in the country illegally voted for her. Mr. Spicer declined to elaborate on what Mr. Trump meant but did not back away from the assertion. \u201cThe president does believe that,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a belief that he\u2019s maintained for a while, a concern that he has about voter fraud. And that\u2019s based on information that\u2019s provided. \u201d It remains unclear what form a federal investigation may take. While the F. B. I. has the authority to look into voter fraud, that appears not to be what the president has in mind. Mr. Spicer said it was too early to know, but mentioned the possibility of a task force or commission. He cited studies that he said showed that voter rolls contained the names of millions of people who should not be there because they had moved, were not citizens or had since died. But the author of one of those major studies said Wednesday that Mr. Spicer and the president appeared to be misunderstanding the numbers. David Becker, who for six years was in charge of the election initiative for the Pew Center on the States, said that voter rolls often had    information, but that there was virtually no evidence that many of those names were used to vote illegally. \u201cIt does exist, but it happens in very, very small numbers and nothing like what is claimed by the president,\u201d Mr. Becker said. He said systems across the country to prevent voter fraud would have caught any huge effort to vote illegally. \u201cWe would have seen that well before the election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have seen a swelling of the voter rolls and records. \u201d In Ohio, for example, a review of the state\u2019s elections in 2012 and 2014 found that out of millions of votes cast, there were 667 allegations of fraud, of which just 149 were referred to law enforcement for investigation, Mr. Husted said. The Ohio review, which happens after every election, also found that 436 unauthorized immigrants were registered to vote and that 44 had voted. \u201cVoter fraud exists. It\u2019s not widespread or systemic,\u201d said Mr. Husted, who said he had voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that that is happening on a   basis. \u201d Mr. Husted said he would be happy to share Ohio\u2019s review of the 2016 election with the federal government when it was completed. And he said Mr. Trump could aid states by sharing government databases that could help them clean their voter rolls. In his Twitter message Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested that a federal review could lead to improvements in voting procedures. But Democrats and voting experts criticized the president for focusing his allegations on voter fraud while resisting the intelligence community\u2019s conclusions involving Russian hacking of the Democratic National Commitee and officials connected to Mrs. Clinton during last year\u2019s election. \u201cIt\u2019s more important that we investigate the known instances of election fraud, rather than imagined ones,\u201d said Kim Alexander, the president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to improving the voting process. \u201cWe have had an election that was compromised by foreign interests. That\u2019s the real danger that has come out of this election. \u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the president should \u201cknock this off\u201d and move on. \u201cThis is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it,\u201d he said on CNN. And several Democratic lawmakers and state election officials said they suspected that Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations were part of a plan by Republicans looking for reasons to justify new restrictions on voting to benefit their party, particularly targeting immigrants and  . \u201cThere has been a sustained effort across the country, rooted in similar conspiracies about voter fraud, to make it harder for Americans to vote,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow this attack on voting rights to continue, and it\u2019s shameful to see such debunked conspiracy theories emanating from the White House. \u201d Mr. Padilla, the California secretary of state, said he also worried that Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated allegations about fraud would undermine the confidence that Americans had in the integrity of the voting system. \u201cStoking fear and concern is undermining people\u2019s faith in our elections,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628321.9905047}
