[Gorka said that \u201cthings have changed fundamentally\u201d in the   impasse over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs, \u201cbecause America is back, and because you have the master of the \u2018art of the deal\u2019 as the   . \u201d  \u201cIf you just look at the statements coming out of Beijing, if you look at the decision with regards to purchasing U. S. coal over North Korean coal, things have fundamentally changed,\u201d he said. \u201cNorth Korea is probably the most Stalinist state that has ever existed, probably more Stalinist than Joseph Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cAs such, it\u2019s simply economically unviable. As a result, it has been propped up by China for decades, but at this point after our recent decisions to act in Afghanistan and Syria, the regime in China is starting to reassess just how much it is in its national interest to maintain that client state in North Korea. That\u2019s why this isn\u2019t just the     news, Alex. \u201d Gorka said the usual national security debate lacks strategic sophistication. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I came on board with Breitbart all those years ago, because the national security debate in D. C. and in general was just sophomoric. It was either you\u2019ve got to be a neoconservative and invade other people\u2019s countries, or you\u2019ve got to be Ron Paul and you\u2019ve got to be an isolationist,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWell, the world\u2019s a little bit more complicated that that,\u201d he contended. \u201cThis president is not an interventionist, but he understands that without leadership, without America showing the way the system should work, then we have anarchy, and we have bad actors exploiting the vacuums created. Nothing\u2019s changed about Donald J. Trump. He\u2019s not different since before the election, as opposed to being the president. But the fact is, without leadership in the world, you have the chaos that we inherited after the last eight years. \u201d Marlow professed initial skepticism of the missile strike on Syria as the gateway to further intervention, but said that if it proved to be an isolated \u201cone and done\u201d action, it sent an important message to the world\u2019s bad actors. Gorka said both the Syria strike and the detonation of a huge MOAB munition in Afghanistan should be understood \u201cnot simply in terms of what we did physically on that day. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just about 59 cruise missiles, or that   bomb. It\u2019s about the philosophy that statecraft, running the ship of state, can never be done purely based upon diplomacy and just words. If you\u2019re not prepared to back it up with force  \u2014   that doesn\u2019t mean invading other people\u2019s countries, but using force where necessary  \u2014   then all it is, is just pieces of paper,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president understands that all the levers of national power must be used together, if we are to secure America and the interests of American citizens. It\u2019s much more than about that event. It\u2019s about understanding what it takes to be America again,\u201d said Gorka. Marlow cited Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s statement that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal, and asked if this was an indication the Trump administration would not scrap the deal, as Trump said before the election. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d Gorka replied. \u201cRight now it means simply that there are certain aspects of the deal that are being held to, but the deal itself, and all U. S.  policy, is being reviewed right now. \u201d \u201cDon\u2019t read too much into that, because everything is on the table in terms of reviewing the JCPOA,\u201d he advised, referring to the nuclear deal by its formal acronym. Responding to reports that the first illegal alien protected by President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has been deported, Gorka said it was a question of reinforcing the rule of law. \u201cWe have incredibly clear language coming out of the Attorney General\u2019s office himself, but listen to what General Kelly said as well: We have laws on the books. It is not   it is not divisive to actually implement those laws and make them real. If somebody doesn\u2019t like that, we have a republic, we have a democratic republic. Those laws need to be changed, if you can change them. But right now, they\u2019re going to be implemented, and that applies to anybody who is an illegal alien. Looking ahead to next month\u2019s scheduled meeting between President Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Gorka expected them to discuss \u201call the obvious questions there are for common concerns to both countries,\u201d including Syria, terrorism, and the Kurdish question. \u201cThere are no simple answers to any of those, but remember: if you just look at the history of the 20th Century, Turkey is a geostrategically important nation,\u201d he said. \u201cGeography is destiny. Look at the size of the country, look at where it is. So that meeting is an important meeting. \u201d Finally, with respect to Tuesday\u2019s murders in Fresno by a man who professed to hate white people and shouted \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d when he was captured, Gorka said he looks at the fact that \u201csince the caliphate was declared by Abu Bakr   in 2014, we have arrested more than 130 people linked to ISIS in America. \u201d \u201cThis is not a joke. There is no front line in this war. The front line is when you leave your house in the morning. Unfortunately, this threat has been allowed to expand. We are going to take it seriously, and we are going to knock it on the head,\u201d he promised. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
