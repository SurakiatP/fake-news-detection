I honestly don\u2019t get how so many people got dragged into this idiot\u2019s nonsense . \\nHe recently endorsed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump which says everything you need to know about his character. He willfully supports the most corrupt political figure in American history over a man who has a track record of building and creating great things around the world. Under what logical scenario does that make any sense? One would only do that if they are insane or have ulterior motives. Especially considering how he has sold himself as a so-called \u201cconservative\u201d media personality for so many years. \\nNow he is declaring a war on the Alt-Right . He has gone so far as to claim that the Alt-Right are Kremlin backed terrorists being armed by Vladimir Putin lol. \\nHe also suggests that people run away from anyone who uses the term \u201ccuckservative\u201d largely because he knows that he is the\u00c2 very definition of that. \\nThis fool is insane. He should be put in a mental institution for the rest of his miserable life. There is no proof of anything that he is claiming.'"}, "time": 1742563395.755588}
