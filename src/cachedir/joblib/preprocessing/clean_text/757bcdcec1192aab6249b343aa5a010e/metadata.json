[In a letter sent Tuesday, Senator Tom Cotton and nine other Republican Senators urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to \u201cuse the all tools available\u201d to reverse the Obama administration\u2019s policy of having a federal council designate   financial companies as \u201csystemically important financial institutions,\u201d a designation that brings with it stringent supervision by the Federal Reserve, new capital requirements, and costly regulatory burdens.  Critics of the policy claim that designating nonbank companies as SIFI\u2019s is counterproductive because it creates the impression that were the companies to fail despite regulation, the government would act to bail them out. Instead of dismantling Too Big To Fail,  SIFI designation actually reinforces it, critics charge. \u201cAmong its many flaws,   enshrined \u2018Too Big To Fail\u2019 as an official policy by creating a Federal council to designate nonbanks as \u2018systemically important financial institutions.\u2019 These designations offer large firms implicit taxpayer backing for future bailouts and result in massive new regulatory costs,\u201d the group of Senators said in a statement Tuesday. The Senators frame their letter as supporting the President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order on financial regulation. It was signed by Senators Cotton, Pat Toomey, Richard Chelby, Mike Crapo, Mike Rounds, John Kennedy, Ben Sasse, David Perdue, Thom Tillis and Tim Scott. The   Act created a new financial regulatory body called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, an intergovernmental taskforce led by the Treasury Secretary, and gave it the power to designate financial companies as SIFIs. The council, known as FSOC, designated three large insurance companies \u2014  American International Group, Prudential Insurance, and MetLife \u2014  as SIFIs. Last year, a federal judge ruled that the designation of MetLife was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d describing FSOC\u2019s process as \u201cfatally flawed. \u201d The Obama administration appealed that ruling and the case was heard by the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals last fall. Many expected the Trump administration would drop the appeal, letting the original ruling overturning the SIFI designation stand. The failure of the Trump administration to act has perplexed allies of the administration on Capitol Hill and in the insurance industry. Although the letter from Senator Cotton and others doesn\u2019t explicitly mention the MetLife case, it is undoubtedly an attempt to spur the administration to action on the matter. \u201cThe FSOC\u2019s process for designating   systemically important financial institutions lacks transparency and accountability,\u201d the letter states, echoing the language of the federal court\u2019s decision overturning the MetLife designation. \u201cThere have been   talks about this, yet nothing has happened. Hopefully this gets the administration off its keister,\u201d said one person familiar with the background of the letter. One concern is that if the administration does not act swiftly, the D. C. Circuit Court could issue a decision reversing the lower court. That would complicate efforts to reverse the designation of the insurance companies as SIFIS.'"}, "time": 1742563428.6398094}
