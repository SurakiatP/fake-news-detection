One of his advisors, former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, said that we may have to deal with his orange face again in 2020. \\nIn an interview with POLITICO, Gingrich said : \u201cThe challenge for everybody\u2019s going to be, \u2018What if he gets 48 or 49 percent?\u2019 And what if he says: \u2018You know, I like this campaign and stuff. I ain\u2019t leaving\u2019? There will then be a Trump Party.\u201d \\nIt looks like the Republicans are already planning to obstruct Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if she gets elected. Gingrich said : \u201cI think it\u2019ll be very difficult for the country \u2026 I think their message to the Republican leadership will be, \u2018You had better prepare to fight her every single day.\u2019\u201d \\nTrump broached the subject at a rally in Sanford, Florida. He said that this election is the party\u2019s \u201clast chance.\u201d \\nThe Trumpkin proclaimed : \u201cRepublicans have to finally get smart and come together. This is our last chance. This is bigger than me or any of us. It\u2019s about our country. This is about ending Obamacare. This is about the Supreme Court. This is about rebuilding our military and taking care of our vets, strengthening our borders and keeping our companies and jobs from leaving our beloved country. This is about restoring the rule of law, saving our Constitution and keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s funny that he\u2019s talking about party unity when he spreads divisive, hateful rhetoric, and has for the last year-and-a-half that has split the Republican Party. It became especially bad after the infamous Access Hollywood audio leaked. He has done his best to alienate just about every group out there over the course of his campaign. Hopefully, he will lose to a Hillary Clinton landslide on November 8. Vote Blue! \\nHere is a news clip about the Newt Gingrich interview : \\nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot .
