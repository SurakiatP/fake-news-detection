I thanked him, and you\u2019d think that was that. Well, not by a long chalk.\u201d \\n\u201cWhen we got to the second door, we both realised what was going to unfold,\u201d Said Simmons who had just been forcibly ejected from the local A&E department. \u201cSo he held the second door and I thanked him again.\u201d \\n\u201cAs etiquette requires, we both snorted a laugh and shook our heads but by this time we realised that a third door was coming up and we were both crippled with embarrassment \u2013 I mean, what\u2019s the protocol here? I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d \\n\u201cSo after the third door I just laughed too loud and about halfway up the next bit of corridor I grabbed my chest, hit the deck and started making an alarming wheezing noise. I could tell we were both relieved.\u201d \\nThe door-holder in question was an office temp who had only been working at the building for a few days and it was he who called the ambulance. \\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take me a while to get over this,\u201d Said the minimum-wage earner. \u201cIt was so embarrassing, but thanks to Mr. Simmons\u2019s quick thinking I\u2019ll know what to do next time. Probably put it on my CV.\u201d \\nSimmons says the fact that he may face legal proceedings for misuse of the emergency services does not make him regret his actions. \\n\u201cI\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat \u2013 no pun intended.\u201d He said, clearly intending the pun.
