They are variously referred to as Visitors, Others, Star People, Et\u2019s, etc\u2026They are visiting Earth now; this is not a matter of conjecture or wistful thinking. \u2013 Theodor C. Loder III, Phd, Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences, University of New Hampshire\\nScroll Down For Videos Below This is in large part due to the fact that we now have hundreds of credible witnesses that have officially testified to the reality of an extraterrestrial presence, and its relation to the already disclosed UFO \u2018problem.\u2019\\nThis is why members of government, like John Podesta, Chief of Staff for Bill Clinton, Counsellor to Barack Obama and head of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign before she dropped out, stated that \u201cthe time to pull the curtain back on this subject is long overdue. We have statements from the most credible sources, those in a position to know, about a fascinating phenomenon, the nature of which is yet to be determined.\u201d (taken from Leslie Kean\u2019s 2010 New York Times bestseller, UFOs: Generals, Pilots, And Government Officials Go On The Record, in which Podesta wrote the forward)\\nAlthough keep in mind, governments have been deceiving us on several different topics throughout history, it\u2019s safe to assume that they would use \u201cUFO disclosure\u201d for their own personal interests in the same way they\u2019ve used \u2018false flag\u2019 terrorism. Something to think about, but definitely a topic for another article.\\nAs the F-4 approached a range of 25 nautical miles it lost all instrumentation and communications. When the F-4 turned away from the object and apparently was no longer a threat to it, the aircraft regained all instrumentation and communications. Another brightly lighted object came out of the original object. The second object headed straight toward the F4. \u201d \u2013 One example out of hundreds involving the military intercept of a UFO that was tracked on air radar, ground radar, and visually confirmed by pilots (source)\\nWhy It\u2019s Time To Listen To Contactees, Abductees & Experiencers/ A Psychological Standpoint Just to clarify, \u2018contactees\u2019 are usually those who have reported \u2018friendly\u2019 contact experiences with extraterrestrials, \u2018abductees\u2019 are those who have had what they perceive to be fearful experiences, and experiencers are those who neither view the experience as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad,\u201d but simply just an experience. It\u2019s important to note this, because various people have reported different types of experiences with different types of beings.\\n\u201cYes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered \u2026 We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Edgar Mitchell, ScD, 6th man to walk on the Moon(source) (source)\\nThe reality is that some people who claim to have had contact with intelligent extraterrestrial beings actually have.\\nJohn Mack, A Harvard professor, psychiatrist and Pulitzer Price recipient stresses that:\\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s both. It\u2019s both literally, physically happening to a degree; and it\u2019s also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension. And so the phenomenon stretches us, or it asks us to stretch to open to realities that are not simply the literal physical world, but to extend to the possibility that there are other unseen realities from which our consciousness, our, if you will, learning processes over the past several hundred years have closed us off.\u201d (source)\\nWe published an article earlier this year regarding John Mack, and more than 60 school children witnessing non-human beings and a large craft landing. The children were interviewed by him, and it was quite a remarkable story with all of the children providing very similiar stories. Until this day these children have been speaking of it, an event occurred more than 20 years ago\u2026.\\n\u201cThey describe these events like a person talks about something that has happened to them. I can tell that these are people of sound mind telling me something\u2026\u201d (quote continued and taken from the video linked below) -Dr. John Mack, professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School\\nYou can watch THIS video of Mack Interview the children, and you can read THIS article that goes more into detail on that case.\\nAccording to retired McGill University professor in the Department of Psychology (research areas beings cognition and cognitive Neuroscience), Dr. Don Donderi:\\n\u201cSome of what people report as UFOs are extraterrestrial (ET) vehicles. Some of those extraterrestrial vehicles actually have ET crews, and some of those ET crews catch and release humans.\u201d (source)\\nAcademicians like these, and others like Richard Dolan, David M. Jacobs and more have been studying this phenomena for decades, and the reports of beings and examining why they are here, what they are doing, what they look like and more has been documented by their (and others) research.\\nWhat I find most fascinating about these stories is how many of them seem to compliment each other instead of contradicting each other, which just adds to the mystery.\\nAs far as physical research goes:\\n\u201cThere are a great many photographs of such body marks, many of which are in an equilateral triangle pattern of red dots on the wrist or near the ankle. Also common are scoop marks,\u201d in which it appears as if a small amount of tissue was removed from beneath the skin, leaving an indentation.\u201d -Richard Dolan (taken from his book, UFOs for the 21st century mind)\\nBelow is a clip of Dr. Roger Leir. a doctor of podiatric medicine, and arguably the best known individual with regards to extracting alleged alien implants. He has performed more than fifteen surgeries that removed sixteen separate distinct objects. These objects have been investigated by several prestigious laboratories, including Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico Tech, and many others. Unfortunately, he passed away in March 2014, but his legacy lives on.\\nTruth is, as former NASA astronaut and Princeton Physics Professor puts it, \u201cthere is abundant evidence that we are being contacted, that civilizations have been visiting us for a vary long time.\u201d\\n**The information below is a very brief summary of a few of the most commonly reported extraterrestrials based on all of the research I\u2019ve done on this subject.\\nHuman Looking Extraterrestrials \\nExtraterrestrials with features drastically similar to human beings have reported by contactees, abductees and experiencers for a long time. This type of experience is actually quite common. Many people have reported that they\u2019ve been taken into ships, and warned about the direction the human race is heading. They\u2019re also often portrayed as assisting our planet in various ways, both on a physical level and an energetic one.\\n\u201cDecades ago, visitors from other plants warned us about where we were headed and offered to help. But instead, we, or at least some of us, interpreted their visits as a threat, and decided to shoot first and ask questions after.\u201d \u2013 Paul Hellyer, Former Canadian Defense Minister (source)\\nThere have also been reports of human looking extraterrestrials working with humans inside of what\u2019s known as the military industrial complex with regards to making technological advancements. This is why in the highly classified world, the black budget world, it\u2019s probably the independent government contractors that are working in these areas.\\nStories of human like extraterrestrials date from the beginning of time all the way up to the present day, and historical literature is littered with accounts of these types of encounters.\\nMy people tell of Star People who came to us many generations ago. The Star people brought spiritual teachings and stories and maps of the cosmos and they offered these freely. They were kind, loving, and set a great example. When they left us, my people say there was a loneliness like no other.\u201d \u2013 Richard Wagamese, Ojibway Author (source)\\nAs far as the picture above, I am not sure if it\u2019s real or fake, but that\u2019s not the point. It was used to spark your imagination, it is supposedly one of the extraterrestrials that was discovered dead inside of a ship that was located on the moon \u2013 retrieved from one of the Apollo missions.\\n\\nThe picture to your left was released by a professor by the name of Bruno Sammaciccia. A Catholic historian with degrees in psychology and psychiatry, he was the author of more than 100 books and a well-known, distinguished figure in Italian academic circles.\\nHe is thought to have taken this photograph of an alleged 10 foot tall extraterrestrial being in Italy in 1976.\\nIf you read the lore, there are many stories of a mysterious group of extraterrestrials who look like humans and who established underground bases in Italy, meeting with local residents between 1956 and 1978.\\nNot long before his death, Sammaciccia claimed he had had direct physical contact with extraterrestrials over several decades. Dr. Roberto Pinotti, a leading Italian UFOlogist, has since confirmed his decades-long knowledge of the Sammaciccia cases. When it comes to human extraterrestrial contact in modern history, this case ranks among the most compelling, given the pictures and the number of witnesses involved.\\nHere is a brief summary of the Sammaciccia contact story as given by UFO researcher Dr. Michael Salla (founder of exopolitics.org):\\nIn 1956 when Bruno Sammaciccia and two friends met with two mysterious individuals who said they were extraterrestrials. One was over 8 foot tall while the other was just over 3 foot. Sammaciccia and his friends, initially skeptical, were eventually taken into a large underground base where they saw more of the alleged extraterrestrials. They also saw their children being educated, some of the advanced technologies they used, and their space ships. Finally convinced that they were really having physical contact with extraterrestrials, Sammaciccia and his friends began to help the extraterrestrials. They began with material support by arranging for truckloads of fruit, food and other material to be transported and unloaded at an extraterrestrial base. Eventually, two truckloads of supplies were being delivered every month to bases in different regions of Italy where Sammaciccia and his assistants lived.\\nSammaciccia finally described a violent conflict between two factions of extraterrestrials trying to influence humanity\u2019s development and future. While his \u2018Friendship\u2019 faction promoted cosmic unity and ethical development, the other faction promoted technological development at all cost. This led to periodic violent clashes between the factions. Eventually, the underground bases of Sammaciccia\u2019s extraterrestrial friends was destroyed in 1978. Survivors had to leave the Earth but promised to return at a future time when humanity was ready for a more ethical future of humanity interacting with extraterrestrials.\\nSammaciccia\u2019s astounding story sounds like an episode from Star Trek, but it is well supported by documentary evidence, some of Italy\u2019s finest UFO researchers, and first hand witnesses of the events described. Some of the witnesses were leading statesmen, scholars and high society figures from Italy and Europe.\\nBelow is a lecture given by one of the world\u2019s foremost researchers of this topic, Timothy Good. He goes into detail about this supposed encounter, as well as many others.\\nTo the left you will see a picture that was given to the world by Phil Schneider.\\nPhil was a very controversial figure, as was his death. He was born in 1947 and was the son of Oscar and Sally Schneider. Oscar was a Captain in the United States Navy who apparently worked in nuclear medicine and helped design the first nuclear submarines. He was also supposedly part of the famous \u2018Philadelphia Experiment,\u2019 as well as Operation Crossroads, a program to test nuclear weapons.\\nOscar Schneider is the gentleman to the right of the man with the red circle around his head. Phil (man in the video below, apparently Oscars son, and Oscar appear to resemble each other quite strongly. The man with the circle around his head is the supposed extraterrestrial. The others are apparently some of the world\u2019s top physicists from the time.\\n\\nPhilip claimed to be an ex-government structural engineer who was involved in building underground military bases (DUMB) around the country. We\u2019ve actually published a couple of detailed articles about DUMBs, whose existence is not mere speculation.\\nOther common looks are tall, muscular with long hair, blue eyes and blond hair. The same type of figure has also been reported with black and white beings. Some reports have detailed beings with blue skin, larger eyes, as well as shorter beings, with a little more \u2019round\u2019 of a head. There seems to be a large variation and a possibility of several different looking human-like extraterrestrial beings. This raises some very interesting questions regarding the origin of our species, if the humanoid form is common throughout the universe, what does that mean?\\nContanctee\u2019s commonly refer to these beings being from various star systems like Arcturus, Sirius, Andromeda and the Pleiades, just to name a few. Cat/bird like humanoid (like above) beings are also fairly common among supposed encounters.\\nIt\u2019s also noteworthy to mention that all types of beings seem to communicate using telepathy. The following is a selected list of downloadable peer-reviewed journal articles on psi (psychic) phenomena, most published in the 21 st century, you can click HERE Related CE Article: U.S. Defence Physicist Spills The Beans On What\u2019s Really Happening On The Moon\\nThe Grey Alien The grey alien is another very common type of extraterrestrial that\u2019s been reported by several abductees, contactees and experiencers. Reports range from small, three to four feet tall beings all the way up to seven to nine foot tall beings and everything in between.\\nOne of the most common types of experiences among several abductees is one in which they have their sperm or eggs extracted. Many have gone through what seems to be a pretty scary experience, despite the fact that multiple times people have reported the beings communicating to them and trying to calm them down, and tell the person that they weren\u2019t going to cause any harm to them. At other times, forceful abduction goes without any communication. Many abductee\u2019s report being impregnated, and then abducted years after to see their hybrid child. This seems to be a very common experience, and suggests that this race (Greys) are creating a human/grey hybrid race, or have been tinkering with the DNA of human beings for quite some time. Many researchers have suggested that these hybrids are already here, and that many babies being born today could have been \u2018tinkered\u2019 with. There have also been sightings of Grey like beings taking vegetation from our planet (perhaps\u2019s to study, alien scientists?).\\nThere have also been reports of woman being impregnated by a supposed extraterrestrial or extraterrestrial/human hybrid. Shortly after the experience the women are taken by \u2018government\u2019 agencies and the baby is removed and taken away to be studied by them. It\u2019s not uncommon for these people who have had these experiences to get visits by these unknown people who seem to want to know more about the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon.\\nThere are some reports of races like these working with certain governments (or \u2018shadow governments\u2019) in a technological exchange program. I have come across stories in my research where some groups of beings warn the human race not work with other groups of beings. These stories are endless, and quite fascinating, but I\u2019ll save that for another article.\\nReptilians \\nThe \u2018Reptilian\u2019 type being is one that\u2019s been reported and depicted in various human cultures that date back thousands of years all the way up to the present day. These beings have been reported as \u2018friendly,\u2019not so friendly and in between. That\u2019s a common theme throughout most supposed extraterrestrial species. The fact that two different beings of the same race can be reported as benevolent and the other as malevolent.\\nMany people seem to believe that reptilian type beings are one (out of many) working behind the scenes with those who control the government to \u2018en-slave\u2019 the human race. Some even believe that that the global elite are in large part reptilian in origin.\\nTo be honest, it\u2019s not that far fetched. After researching this topic in depth for almost a decade, there is no doubt in my mind that not only have governments and \u2018shadow governments\u2019 become aware of the extraterrestrial presence, but they\u2019ve interacted with several different groups of extraterrestrials.\\nIt\u2019s Ok To Ask These Questions Just to re-emphasize that things like this need to be discussed more, because they are and have been discussed at the highest levels of government, in secret, for almost one hundred years. For example, this particular FBI document was addressed to \u201ccertain scientists of distinction,\u201d to \u201caeronautical and military authorities,\u201d and to \u201ca number of public officials.\u201d\\nThe document is a letter that was sent to the director of FBI in Washington from the San Fransisco office, on a matter pertaining to UFOs & extraterrestrials:\\n\u201cLt. Colonel (name redacted) of G2 [G2 means army intelligence], San Francisco advised today he has no further information, and that our Seattle office is in possession of all information known by him and is handling the matter at Tacoma, Washington.\u201d\\nThe document goes on to provide a copy of a letter written by someone with \u201cseveral university degrees\u201d and a former \u201cuniversity department head.\u201d\\nThe memorandum also states that \u201cthe mere fact that the data herein were obtained by so-called \u2018supernormal\u2019 means is probably sufficient to insure its disregard by nearly all persons addressed.\u201d\\nKey words above \u2013 the fact that they would like to \u201cinsure its disregard\u201d by \u201cnearly\u201d everyone addressed.Does this mean that \u2018some\u2019 of the people addressed should not disregard it?\\nThe letter goes on to outline and state that: (pages 21 & 22)\\nPart of the disks carry crews, others are under remote control. Their mission is peaceful, the visitors contemplate settling on this planet. These visitors are human-like but much larger in size. They are not excarnate Earth people, but come from their own world The disks posses some type of radiant energy. They do not come from any \u201cplanet\u201d as we use the word, but from an etheric planet which interpenetrates with our own and is not perceptible to us. The bodies of the visitors, and the craft also, automatically materialize on entering the vibratory rate of our dense matter. They re-enter the etheric at will, and so simply disappear from our vision, without trace. The region they come from is NOT the astral plane, but corresponds to the Lakas or Talas. Students of esoteric matters will understand these terms Please keep in mind that there are probably many different types of extraterrestrials out there, and many different kinds that have interacted with humanity in some way. The above document is probably referring to one specific race? I don\u2019t know.\\nThis is one out of thousands of examples of documents, and it\u2019s not even one that I would pick as most startling. We should definitely be thinking about why these documents were concealed from the public for decades, and think about what other information still lay dormant inside of the military industrial complex when it comes to extraterrestrial beings. You can see examples of documents that go into detail on what happens when the military tracks a UFO on radar HERE.\\nFor our latest articles on the UFO/Extraterrestrial topic, you can check out the exopolitics section of our website by clicking HERE.\\nThere is a serious possibility that we are being visited and have been visited for many years by people from outer space, from other civilizations . . . [and] it behooves us, in case some of these people in the future or now should turn hostile, to find out who they are, where they come from, and what they want. This should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation and not the subject of \u2018rubishing\u2019 by tabloid newspapers.\\n\u2013 Lord Admiral Hill-Norton, Former Chief of Defence Staff, 5 Star Admiral of the Royal Navy, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee (source)\\nYou may be thinking that this is absolutely ridiculous. I know many people read the titles of articles like this one and turn their heads and scoff, immediately shutting down the possibility that these could be actual photos of extraterrestrial beings. Why do we hold onto our views so staunchly, at the expense of logic and reason? What prevents us from considering new ideas and new ways of viewing the world? So much new information is emerging every day which challenges the current accepted framework of knowledge, and it can be difficult for our opinions to evolve as quickly as the science. Nonetheless, this is an extremely important topic, especially with the recent disclosures of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) by various governments and defence intelligence agencies, and we must work past our reluctance to accept new ideas. These objects are constantly photographed and tracked on radar, as well as visually confirmed by the pilots who are sent out to see them, and we would be foolish to discount this kind of evidence.\\nA photo taken by two Royal Canadian Air Force pilots on August 27th, 1957, in McCleod, Alberta, Canada is another example of such evidence. The pilots were flying in a formation of four F86 Sabre jet aircraft. One of the pilots described the phenomenon as a \u201cbright light which was sharply defined as disk-shaped\u201d and which looked like \u201ca shiny silver dollar sitting horizontal.\u201d Another pilot managed to photograph the object, as you can see above.\\nThere are a number of studies published in reputable peer-reviewed journals analyzing these cases. This specific sighting lasted for a couple of minutes, and the case was analyzed by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, who estimated (from available data) the luminosity of the object (the power output within the spectral range of the film) to be many megawatts. The Sturrock Panel also found that a strong magnetic field surrounding the phenomenon or object was a common occurrence:\\nIf it does indeed turn out that there is relevant physical evidence, if this evidence is carefully collected and analyzed, and if this analysis leads to the identification of several facts concerning the UFO phenomenon, then will be the time for scientists to step back and ask, what are these facts trying to tell us? If those facts are strong enough to lead to a firm conclusion, then will be the time to confront the more bizarre questions. If, for instance, it turns out that all physical evidence is consistent with a mundane interpretation of the causes of UFO reports, there will be little reason to continue to speculate about the role of extraterrestrial beings. If, on the other hand, the analysis of physical evidence turns up very strong evidence that objects related with UFO reports were manufactured outside the solar system, then one must obviously consider very seriously that the phenomenon involves not only extraterrestrial vehicles but probably also extraterrestrial beings. -Peter Sturrock, An emeritus professor of applied physics at Stanford University\\n'"}, "time": 1742562649.8139002}
