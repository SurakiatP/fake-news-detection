Members of Royal Troon Golf Club voted overwhelmingly on Friday to end the club\u2019s   membership policy, paving the way for the club to remain an Open site. \u201cI think this means that Royal Troon Golf Club is reflecting the society in which we exist in the 21st century,\u201d said Martin Cheyne, the club\u2019s captain and top official, in a telephone interview from Troon on Friday night. \u201cWe are not insular, and I\u2019m proud to say that we have made this decision. \u201d Royal Troon, which will host the British Open from July 14 to 17, was the only club in the tournament\u2019s rotation that still did not allow female members. In a statement, the RA, which organizes the British Open, expressed strong support for the change: \u201cWe welcome the decision by Royal Troon Golf Club to admit women as members and look forward to the 145th Open and many great championships to come. \u201d Muirfield, the site of 16 British Opens, was stripped of the right to stage the event in the future after a vote by members of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which owns and operates the club, on allowing female members fell just short of the   majority required to pass.   percent of the club\u2019s members voted in favor of admitting women. Royal Troon\u2019s constitution required only a simple majority. The club did not release a vote total, in part because it did not take a precise count, Cheyne said. \u201cOur custom and practice in the golf club is a straight show of hands,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do a count. It was overwhelming. \u201d Royal Troon\u2019s constitution mandates that only members who are present may take part in such votes, and Cheyne said 360 of the club\u2019s 861 members had been in attendance on Friday night. Royal Troon, which is on the west coast of Scotland, has hosted the British Open on eight previous occasions, most recently in 2004. But Cheyne said the club had reviewed more than the issue of women\u2019s membership in recent months. \u201cThe focus was on all categories of membership and how we could become more involved in promoting golf, a sport which is currently declining: declining in male, female and junior membership,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we did tonight was focus on the single issue of women\u2019s members, but we need to focus on how we can encourage young people to play this game. \u201d In 2014, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews voted to end its   membership policy, which had been in place for 260 years. In 2015, another Open venue  \u2014   Royal St. George\u2019s Golf Club in Kent, England  \u2014   also voted to allow female members. And on Monday, the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers announced that it had called a special meeting to seek approval to organize a second vote later this year on Muirfield\u2019s   membership policy It was unclear when Royal Troon would welcome its first female member. \u201cI think what will happen is that when applications come in, they will be treated the same way as men,\u201d Cheyne said. \u201cThere will be no   women as members. Equality does mean equality. \u201d That is in part because Royal Troon already has an affiliated women\u2019s club: Ladies Golf Club, Troon. Its clubhouse is a short walk from Royal Troon\u2019s clubhouse, and the two clubs will work together to stage the British Open. \u201cWe were a mixed club until the 1890s, when the ladies elected to leave and build their own clubhouse,\u201d Cheyne said. \u201cWe have had a very harmonious relationship for 138 years, and the ladies have always been able to come play the Old Course free of charge any day of the week and enjoy our clubhouse. \u201d Some members of the women\u2019s club had expressed a desire to maintain the status quo, along with concern about the potential cost of applying for membership in Royal Troon. But the vote to admit women had been expected, with the prestige and economic benefits of hosting the Open at stake. \u201cThe importance of being in the international world of golf was recognized by the members,\u201d Cheyne said.'"}, "time": 1742628455.7702007}
