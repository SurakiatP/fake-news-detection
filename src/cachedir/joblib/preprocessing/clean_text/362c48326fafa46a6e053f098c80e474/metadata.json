October 31, 2016 Lloyd Billingsley \\nThe President of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, used a pseudonym to communicate with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her private, unsecured email server. As Andrew McCarthy contended , that was the reason the FBI declined to prosecute Clinton, because the president would have been part of the same action, and that wouldn\u2019t be politically correct. \\nThe current president of the United States is also on record that, contrary to custom, he will linger in Washington DC for a few years. Wherever he chooses to live, the email intrigue suggests continuing back-channel communications with Hillary Clinton, should she become president. That invites a look at what the man the New York Times dubbed \u201cObama\u2019s narrator,\u201d the White House adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word, had to say about the president\u2019s vision of the future. \\n\u201cFew of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment,\u201d David Axelrod explained in his massive 2015 Believer . \u201cBut at home and abroad, Obama was playing a longer game.\u201d As he explained in Columbia, Missouri, on October 30, 2008, \u201cWe are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.\u201d \\nIf this man was a liberal, as Barry Rubin wondered in Silent Revolution: How the Left Rose to Political Power and Cultural Dominance , why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal and Lyndon Johnson with his Great Society? He saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical. \\nAs David Horowitz explained in Volume 7 of the Black Book of the American Left , the president was \u201cborn, bred and trained in the progressive movement.\u201d His mentors were \u201cCommunists and their progressive successors,\u201d so no wonder he presided over \u201cthe institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government\u201d for eight years. What that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident. \\nThe economy remains sluggish and under Obamacare, the president\u2019s signature plan, premiums are skyrocketing . This suggests that, as many believe, Obamacare was simply a demolition plan. In the \u201clonger game,\u201d designated successor Hillary Clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare, what some candidates erroneously call \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d \\nAs Rubin noted, the goal of the left is \u201cto convince Americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved: that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer.\u201d The result \u201cmay be a very long-term and even permanent change of the United States into something else, a nation far less affluent and far less free.\u201d And far less secure, as David Axelrod also indicates. \\nVladimir Putin makes an appearance in Believer but Obama\u2019s narrator does not outline Putin\u2019s background in the KGB. The believer includes nothing about Putin\u2019s role in East Germany, a Stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape. The narrator avoids Putin\u2019s belief that the breakup of the Soviet Union was \u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.\u201d \\nIn Believer , Putin tells the president, \u201cYou are a highly educated man. I come from the security sector.\u201d The believer then asks the president for his assessment of Putin. \\n\u201cHe\u2019s smart, tough, clear about his interests and without a trace of sentimentality,\u201d the president says. That is not very strong language for a KGB veteran and expansionist autocrat. \\nIn his narrator\u2019s account, the president uses the word \u201cmotherf\""}, "time": 1742562834.9900908}
