Gallup began surveying Americans about the police in 1965.\\nThe 2016 poll also shows a major change in attitudes from just a year earlier. The 2015 poll showed the highest level to date of Americans lacking confidence in their police officers, at 18 percent.\\n\u201cThe increase in shootings of police coincided with high-profile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. Despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents, respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites,\u201d Gallup reported in analyzing its results.\\n\u201cThe sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive \u2014 both politically and for their lives while they are on duty \u2014 amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings,\u201d it added.\\nGallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer,\u201d it wrote.\\nWhat do you think?'"}, "time": 1742564270.2860396}
