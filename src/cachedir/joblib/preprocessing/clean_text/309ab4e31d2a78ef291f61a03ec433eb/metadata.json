[Speaking with a    Nigerian refugee who now lives in Rome, Michigan\u2019s coach was presented Sunday with the basic, fundamental question of why American football is called \u201cfootball,\u201d given that players barely use their feet.  At a loss for words, Harbaugh summoned his father, Jack, to help give a quick lesson. All in a day\u2019s work. All part of the Roman experience. All part of Michigan football\u2019s   blitz of Rome. \u201cThe smiles on everybody\u2019s faces here,\u201d Jack Harbaugh said, \u201cit\u2019s just so fantastic. \u201d The Wolverines landed in Italy around 9 a. m. Sunday. The entire group has yet to arrive  \u2014   more will be on the way Monday. But the first group of travelers exited their   flight and headed straight toward Rome\u2019s Villa Borghese, a spacious park in the center of the city. There, they spent some time with refugees from the Joel Nafuma Refugee Center, which is located at St. Paul\u2019s Within The Walls Episcopal Church. St. Paul\u2019s, built in 1873, was the first Roman   church to be built inside Rome\u2019s city walls. Michigan handed out more than 50 Jordan Brand backpacks, filled with Michigan gear, to the refugees in the park. The Harbaughs  \u2014   father and son  \u2014   gave a quick lesson to the refugees about how football is played. \u201cThese are precious gifts,\u201d said    Ade Dagi, a Nigerian refugee who came to Italy in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. \u201d The Wolverines will spend the first four days of the trip touring Rome  \u2014   an excursion that will see them visit the Colosseum, the Pantheon, the Spanish Steps, the Vatican and more. Harbaugh, his wife and two players (Grant Newsome and Salim Makki) will have a chance to sit near Pope Francis on Wednesday during his weekly Mass. The rest of the team will also be in attendance before touring St. Peter\u2019s Square. Michigan is the first Football Bowl Subdivision team to take a spring trip abroad, and it\u2019s already seeing the benefits. \u201c(A refugee) I met said he came here with one shirt on his back, a pair of shorts and some shoes that didn\u2019t fit,\u201d Michigan quarterback Wilton Speight said. \u201cA lot of us take that for granted. We\u2019re here in Jordan jumpsuits with an American and Italy flag on them. It kind of puts all this in perspective a little bit. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562282.4853897}
