Prior to the trip, forget what birds are: When you\u2019re tripping, you\u2019ll eventually learn about birds, and it\u2019ll blow your fuckin\u2019 mind. \\n2. Surround yourself with lots of sharp knives and guns: You\u2019ll want to be able to fight off any terrifying creatures that might suddenly appear before you. \\n3. Set your alarm to go off every six seconds to remind you to breathe: Remember, safety first. It may seem \u201cdorky,\u201d but setting a breath alarm can save your life. \\n4. Write the words \u201cGOOD TIME\u201d on your forehead: That way, if you\u2019re feeling depressed at any point while tripping, you can just look in the mirror and be reminded of the type of time that you\u2019re supposed to be having! \\n5. Politely ask any terminally ill loved ones to hold off on dying until after your trip: They will understand that you want your experience to be mind-opening, not sad. \\n6. For god\u2019s sake, make sure you husk all of your corn before you dose: If you want a pleasant trip, you\u2019ve gotta make sure you husk every last ear of corn you\u2019ve got. Yes, even the ones you have in your storehouse! \\n7. Keep a few Trivial Pursuit cards in your pocket: When you\u2019re eventually stricken with a powerful and lasting sense that you know everything that everyone is going to say and, therefore, you know everything forever, a tough Science & Nature question can be your best route back to reality.
