Jepsen said in a statement. In the   case, Judge Thomas G. Moukawsher of State Superior Court in Hartford found last week that Connecticut was \u201cdefaulting on its constitutional duty\u201d to give all children an adequate education because the state was allowing students in poor districts to languish while those in wealthy districts excelled. Judge Moukawsher gave the state 180 days to revamp teacher evaluations and compensation, school funding policies, special education services and graduation requirements. The ruling was met with enthusiasm by elected officials in some of the state\u2019s poorer cities, but others, including the state\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, objected. Sheila Cohen, the president of the union, the Connecticut Education Association, in a statement on Thursday called Judge Moukawsher\u2019s decision \u201cbroad and overreaching. \u201d Advocates for people with disabilities were also troubled by aspects of the ruling, which suggested that some students might be too disabled for educational services, while also calling for more equitable access to services. Nancy B. Alisberg, managing attorney at Connecticut\u2019s Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons With Disabilities, part of a national network of civil rights organizations, said she worried that \u201cschools could say, \u2018Oh no, this child is too disabled, they won\u2019t benefit from an education, so we don\u2019t have to provide them with anything.\u2019 It is, frankly, terrifying. \u201d Ms. Alisberg added, \u201cI think it boils down to a belief on the part of the court that there are certain students who, based on the level of their disability, don\u2019t deserve an education. \u201d The state said in its appeal that Judge Moukawsher demanded changes to educational policies that could be enacted only by the Connecticut General Assembly. \u201cThis decision would wrest educational policy from the representative branches of state government, limit public education for some students with special needs, create additional municipal mandates concerning graduation and other standards and alter the basic terms of educators\u2019 employment  \u2014   and entrust all of those matters to the discretion of a single, unelected judge,\u201d Mr. Jepsen, a Democrat, wrote in his statement. There have been dozens of school funding lawsuits across the country. But this one, known as Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding v. Rell, was set apart by the extent of the changes the judge required, which went far beyond dollars. The coalition said it was weighing its options. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, has stood on both sides of the case. When the lawsuit was filed in 2005, Mr. Malloy, then the mayor of Stamford, spoke out in support. Years later, he appointed Judge Moukawsher to his current seat on the bench. Now the state is resisting the judge\u2019s decision. Mr. Malloy said in a statement that he accepted the attorney general\u2019s decision to appeal and hoped systemic education problems could be addressed in the coming session of the General Assembly, calling a legislative approach \u201calways preferable to a judicial decision. \u201d \u201cWe hope that this moment marks the start, rather than the stalling, of a statewide dialogue around finding a better way to fund our schools, which ultimately results in a better solution for our students and communities,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe should act together, and we should do it sooner rather than later. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562068.051193}
