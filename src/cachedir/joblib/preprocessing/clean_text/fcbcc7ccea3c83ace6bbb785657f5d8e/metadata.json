Opposition leaders, addressing protesters massed along the capital\u2019s broad main highway, promised to increase the pressure on Mr. Maduro\u2019s   government with a   general strike on Friday. \u201cThis government has lost the most important thing, and that is what we have today: the people,\u201d said Henrique Capriles, a   presidential candidate and leader of the Primera Justicia Party. \u201cGentlemen of the government, we are giving you a deadline. \u201d Thousands of demonstrators rallied in many other Venezuelan cities. In M\u00e9rida, 73 people were injured during a clash between protesters and the police, M\u00e9rida\u2019s mayor, Carlos Garc\u00eda, said. Armed groups created to protect the government were also involved in the fighting. A police officer was shot and killed during a protest in the state of Miranda, the interior minister, N\u00e9stor Reverol, said Wednesday night. If the government does not allow the referendum to go forward, the opposition parties said they would lead a march to the presidential palace next Thursday. The protest was a powerful display of unity from the opposition, which has responded with fury to the decision last week by Venezuela\u2019s Electoral Council to suspend the process for organizing a recall referendum. The council\u2019s ruling, which halted the collection of voters\u2019 signatures needed to initiate the referendum, was a sharp break with the government\u2019s commitment until now to holding elections. \u201cThis is a dangerous new phase,\u201d said David Smilde, a scholar of Venezuela at Tulane University and a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cI think the government last week really changed the game. \u201d \u201cApparently they see this as a safer line of resistance than going forward with the referendum,\u201d he added. On Tuesday, the   National Assembly voted to begin a political trial against Mr. Maduro, accusing him of carrying out a coup against the Constitution. Mr. Maduro has described the referendum drive as a coup against his elected government. Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Venezuelans, scrambling to find food and medicine in a collapsing economy, would vote to remove Mr. Maduro. \u201cThe right does not want dialogue because they want a coup and foreign intervention,\u201d Mr. Maduro said before a small crowd of   supporters gathered outside the presidential palace on Wednesday. \u201cBut here there will be no coup nor intervention. \u201d Mr. Maduro has responded to the opposition\u2019s activism with calls for dialogue, which opposition leaders believe is a bid to wait them out. Mr. Maduro met on Wednesday with leaders of the different branches of government, which are all firmly under his party\u2019s control, with the exception of the National Assembly. Photos in a Twitter message by Mr. Maduro\u2019s spokesman highlighted the empty chair reserved for Henry Ramos Allup, the opposition president of the National Assembly, who was at the protest instead of at Mr. Maduro\u2019s meeting. \u201cI am not going to attend this theater, this farce,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. The Vatican has stepped in to mediate, but it is unclear which opposition leaders, if any, will attend the first round of the discussions scheduled for Sunday on Margarita Island. The opposition has instead unified around street protests. The challenge will be to \u201ctake this outpouring and channel it into a sustained movement on the streets,\u201d Mr. Smilde said. In the past, rivalries among opposition leaders have made it difficult for them to come together on a strategy. \u201cThey are underperforming given the level of discontent,\u201d he said. That discontent was on full display as people streamed to the protest on Wednesday morning. \u201cEnough of this regime, which puts obstacles to everything,\u201d said Vanessa Furtado, 45, a schoolteacher from the poor neighborhood of Las Minas de Baruta. \u201cThere is no security, no economic or work stability. Maduro is scared. The solution here is electoral, it\u2019s all we have. \u201d Elliot Manuel P\u00e9rez Medina, a college student, was disappointed that the opposition put off marching to the presidential palace on Wednesday. As he spoke, a group of armed government supporters began to surround his group of protesters. \u201cWhy are we going to talk with people who always put a gun to our head and always repress us?\u201d he asked. But not everybody who wanted to attend the protest could do so. Miurka Castillo, 47, said she suffered from seizures this year the shortages were so severe that she cannot find the medicine she needs she spent the morning bartering flour for three pills. \u201cNobody wants to go more than me,\u201d she said. \u201cI need this government to leave. I think that would change things. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564064.160173}
