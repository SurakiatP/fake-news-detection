[Concerning a full repeal of Obamacare, Wall said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been promised this in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016, and these were not lighthearted promises. These were very powerful promises from members of Congress and the U. S. Senate across the political spectrum of Republicans. \u201d  \u201cLo and behold,\u201d added Wall, \u201cthe voters give Republicans Congress, they give them the Senate, and they give them the White House, and all of a sudden, the establishment comes up with a whole lot of reasons why we can\u2019t do what we\u2019ve been promising the American people. \u201d Expressing disappointment at years of promises from Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare only to now produce a bill that falls short of that, Wall said, \u201cI\u2019m deeply disappointed. Republicans in 2015 voted to pretty much fully repeal Obamacare. And I don\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t. \u201d Citing years of Obamacare GOP repeal votes, Wall continued, \u201cThey voted for this [repeal] when they knew it had no chance of actually getting signed into law. All of a sudden, we get a chance to get this signed into law, and they back down. \u201d Concluded Wall, \u201cIt\u2019s, unfortunately, very typical of Republican leadership, but we need to hold them to a higher standard. \u201d More information on the FreedomWorks Day of Action is available here.
