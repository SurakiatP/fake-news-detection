Devin Nunes ( ) told donors on Saturday that Orange County is one of the key battleground regions in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections. [Speaking at the Orange County GOP\u2019s annual Flag Day fundraiser on Saturday, Nunes  \u2014   who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  \u2014   sounded off on the importance of receiving support from Republican donors in the region, which is seen as critical in the fight against the Golden State\u2019s Democratic stronghold.  \u201cIt is so critical for us to win here and keep winning here,\u201d Nunes, who was the event\u2019s keynote speaker, said, according to the Los Angeles Times. A   Republican California enclave, Orange County is now at risk of turning blue. The 2016 presidential election was the first since 1936 that the county went to a Democrat, Hillary Clinton. In February, the Democrats launched an assault on 20 Republicans whose seats are seen as being at risk during the 2018 midterm elections. Four of those seats are wholly or partially in Orange County, and belong to :Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Ed Royce (  ) Rep. Darrell Issa (  ) Rep. Mimi Walters (  ) and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (  ). Republicans have similarly launched a campaign against at least four California Democrat Congressmen who they plan to target and defeat next year. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC)\u2019s \u201ctop offensive targets\u201d are Reps. Ami Bera (  Grove, 7th district) Salud Carbajal (  Barbara, 24th district) Scott Peters (  Diego, 52nd district) and Raul Ruiz (  Springs, 36th district). On Saturday, a crowd of protesters stood outside the GOP\u2019s Flag Day celebration: Little protest outside an OC GOP dinner tonight, where @DevinNunes expected to speak pic. twitter.   \u2014   David Siders (@davidsiders) June 18, 2017,  About 70 protestors outside OC GOP annual Flag Day dinner, where Rep.

Darrel Issa ( ) said, \u201cThey\u2019re pathetic. There were almost none. \u201d He reportedly added, \u201cThere\u2019s a couple million people in the surrounding communities and to have those few tells you the real momentum of this movement has really died. The same has been happening at our office where they come every Tuesday. There\u2019s less every week. \u201d Rep. Rohrabacher reportedly said, \u201cThey don\u2019t want me to talk to my constituents more they want me to talk to them. \u201d He added, \u201cThey don\u2019t represent my constituents. None of them represent my constituents.   \u2026     They are a political organization asking me to pay homage to them. Forget it. \u201d Keeping in line with tradition, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher whipped out his guitar for a tune. The theme of Saturday\u2019s song was reportedly \u201cfat bureaucrats. \u201d The room is nearly clear, but @RepRohrabacher has grabbed a guitar and is singing about \u2019fat bureaucrats\u2019 pic. twitter.   \u2014   David Siders (@davidsiders) June 18, 2017,  During his speech on Saturday, Nunes reportedly said the mainstream media was in part to blame for Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) being shot during practice for the Congressional baseball fundraiser last week by a   Bernie Sanders supporter. Three others were also injured in the attack. \u201cYou could almost see this coming when it happened last week because the level of civil discourse has reached a point that I\u2019ve never seen in my time in office,\u201d he said, according to the Times. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is a political party not willing to accept what happened in the last election. Hopefully it\u2019s a warning sign and hopefully the media will get back to at least pretending to do some real investigative work. \u201d In February, Rohrabacher\u2019s    staffer, Kathleen Staunton, was reportedly knocked unconscious by   protesters as she attempted to leave her office.
