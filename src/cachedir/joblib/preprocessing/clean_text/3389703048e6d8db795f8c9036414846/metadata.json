Trump called on Saturday for a closer relationship between the two nations, saying only \u201cstupid\u201d people or \u201cfools\u201d would think this was unwise. The United States, Mr. Trump wrote in a series of Twitter messages Saturday morning, has \u201cenough problems around the world without yet another one. \u201d He pledged that Russia would \u201crespect us far more than they do now\u201d after he is sworn in as president, and said that the two nations could perhaps work together on the international stage. For years, Russia has been anything but a willing partner of the United States.

Mr. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions as politically motivated, but he appeared to soften that stance in a statement his transition team released after the briefing. He also seemingly conceded Russian involvement in the election, but he has taken pains to point out that there is no evidence that any vote tallies were altered, apparently seeking to avoid the suggestion that his victory was illegitimate. Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that it is time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the focus on Russian meddling in the election, arguing that it has received such attention only because Democrats are embarrassed about their loss  \u2014   an assertion he repeated on Twitter on Saturday.
