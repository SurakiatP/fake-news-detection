Sanders said that director Comey had \u201cessentially taken a stick of dynamite\u201d to the Justice Department after commenting publicly on the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email investigation. When asked if the president was prepared to fire more officials from the Justice Department, Sanders replied, \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of today. \u201d Sanders described a gradual \u201cerosion of trust\u201d surrounding Comey since Trump was inaugurated, and that the president wanted to give him a chance despite the reservations he had about the director. She asserted that it was not true that Trump asked the Justice Department to put together a rationale for Comey\u2019s firing. \u201cI did speak directly to the president and heard directly from him that he, again, had been considering letting Director Comey go pretty much since the day he took office, but that there was no request by him to have a review at the Department of Justice,\u201d she said. She said she was \u201csurprised\u201d by Democrats rushing to defend Comey, despite their insistence that he directly contributed to Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to win the presidency. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had won the election, which thank God she didn\u2019t, but if she had and she had been in the same position, she had have fired Comey immediately and the very Democrats that are criticizing the president today would be dancing in the streets celebrating. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628321.3392599}
