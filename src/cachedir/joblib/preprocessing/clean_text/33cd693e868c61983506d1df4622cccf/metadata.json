The fatalities have seemingly occurred after a breakthrough cancer treatment was just announced. \\nVia AlternativeNews \\n\\nWhat is This New Treatment? The newly developed cancer treatment involves the human protein GcMAF (Globulin component Macrophage Activating Factor). GcMAF works by activating macrophages that are already present within the human body. These macrophages can fight against and destroy cancerous cells.\\nGcMAF is produced naturally inside the body however some people cannot make enough levels of this vital human protein to ward off disease and infection. The idea is that by administering this protein to people, the immune system can be strengthened to fight cancer and reducing the need for more intense, invasive procedures such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. These forms of therapy can often lead to more cancer and deteriorate the human body. What the GcMAF Website Says: Your GcMAF empowers your body to cure itself. In a healthy person your own GcMAF has 11 actions discovered so far, including two on cells, three excellent effects on the brain, and 6 on cancer. Amongst these it acts as a \u2018director\u2019 of your immune system. Time lapse photography over 60 hours shows the cancer monolayer \u2026 first changing from corrugated to smooth \u2026 as the cancer is destroyed. [T]hen the cancer \u2018fingers\u2019 are also eaten and destroyed by the macrophages.\\n\\nThis news is welcomed by everyone. Well, everyone but the mutli-billion dollar cancer industry. The significance of GcMAF\u2019s power could put a major industry out of business \u2013 and that\u2019s the exact reason why the deaths of several holistic doctors has alarmed many.\\nIn just one instance, Florida doctor Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, M.D., who focused heavily on researching GcMAF, was found dead in a river last year. Despite the fact that Bradstreet had a gunshot wound to his chest, his sudden death was ruled a suicide right away. This \u201csuicide\u201d \u2013 which was later discovered to be a murder \u2013 is just out of about seven mysterious deaths that happened in the same time period \u2013 all of them holistic doctors who were focused on the potential of GcMAF to treat and cure cancer.\\nIn just the last year, SIXTY deaths have been reported in the holistic community as more natural, less conventional routes to medicine are explored upon.\\nAlthough it\u2019s not known yet whether there is a correlation or not between these deaths, one thing\u2019s for certain in that it seems Big Pharma has a lot to lose by the research of these doctors who were taken too soon.\\nThis amazing video shows GcMAF killing cancer cells: \\n'"}, "time": 1742561645.3857846}
