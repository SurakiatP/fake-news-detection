With a near   vote of 227 to 198, the House overcame the opposition of Democrats and the anxieties of some Republicans to approve a budget blueprint that allows Republicans to end major provisions of President Obama\u2019s health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.   Donald J. Trump, Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other Republican leaders now face a much bigger challenge: devising their own plan to ensure broad access to health care and coverage while controlling costs. While their party is far from a consensus on how to replace the health care law  \u2014   under which more than 20 million Americans have gained health insurance  \u2014   they will need votes from Democrats in the Senate to enact a robust replacement plan. Republicans have argued that Americans have been crushed by soaring premiums and other unintended effects of the law, which was adopted without any Republican votes. \u201cThis is a critical first step toward delivering relief to Americans who are struggling under this law,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, adding, \u201cThis experiment has failed. \u201d Democrats warned that repeal of the health law would cause hardship for millions of Americans and create chaos in insurance markets and in the health care system, which accounts for about 18 percent of the nation\u2019s economy. \u201cIf we go down this path, we won\u2019t have repeal and replace,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cWhat we\u2019ll have is repeal and repent because we\u2019re going to owe a huge apology to the American people for the damage that we cause. \u201d Representative Suzan DelBene of Washington, a Democrat, said, \u201cThere\u2019s still no plan for what comes next, threatening massive disruption to the entire health care system. \u201d In the days before the House vote, some conservative Republicans, as well as moderates, expressed discomfort about signing off on the budget blueprint without having a clearer picture of how and when Republican leaders planned to replace the health care law. Nine House Republicans ended up voting against the budget measure on Friday. No Democrats voted for it. The Senate approved the same measure early Thursday by a vote of 51 to 48. The House and Senate votes this week  \u2014   essentially procedural steps  \u2014   represented the first of several moves that Republicans plan to make as they work to unwind the health care law. In the coming weeks, they say, they will try to devise a replacement, working closely with Mr. Trump and his choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Representative Tom Price of Georgia. Four committees  \u2014   two in the Senate, two in the House  \u2014   will write language repealing major provisions of the 2010 health law. The resulting legislation can be passed with simple majorities in both chambers, and will be immune to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Then, Republicans say, they will pass one or more   bills to replace selected provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats, they will need help from Democrats to reach the 60 votes necessary to approve such legislation. Mr. Trump voiced support this week for repealing and replacing the health care law \u201cessentially simultaneously,\u201d though it remained to be seen if Republicans in the Senate can win enough Democratic support to adopt a replacement for the existing health care law, given the need to reach 60 votes. In the House debate on Friday, Republicans and Democrats offered wildly differing views of health care and health insurance. Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota, a   Republican, said he had firsthand experience with the Affordable Care Act. \u201cMinnesotans have seen their health insurance choices shrink while their premiums,   and deductibles skyrocket,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cI should know. For the last, in fact, over five years, I\u2019ve been in the individual market, and my own insurance premiums have nearly tripled, and I\u2019ve gone through three insurers. Minnesotans have seen a 50 to 67 percent increase in the premium cost this year alone. \u201d The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who helped engineer passage of the health law, defended it on Friday, saying that every American benefited. \u201cThe Republicans are feeding their ideological obsession with repealing the A. C. A. and dismantling the health and economic security of   families,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. For six years, she said, Republicans have had the chance to put forth an alternative, but \u201cwe\u2019ve seen nothing. \u201d Echoing their colleagues in the Senate, Democrats asked how Republicans planned to go about replacing the Affordable Care Act  \u2014   a complex, arduous task, as Democrats know from their own experience developing and passing the health law in the first place. \u201cWhen you put pen to paper, all hell is going to break loose on your side,\u201d said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. Democrats also tried to draw attention to what they said would be the devastating consequences of repealing the health care law. Over and over, after a Republican member spoke out against the law, Mr. Yarmuth offered several data points specific to the member\u2019s home state, including how many people would lose their health coverage. Republicans, though, were eager to deliver on a central campaign promise. \u201cThe public has rendered judgment on this health care law,\u201d said Representative John Shimkus of Illinois. The differing views among House members on Friday foreshadowed the acrimony that is all but certain in the weeks to come, as Republicans press ahead with their repeal efforts over Democrats\u2019 strenuous objections. So far, lawmakers have shown some creativity in trying to explain the wisdom  \u2014   or lack of wisdom  \u2014   in moving forward with a repeal. On Friday, Representative Drew Ferguson of Georgia, a freshman Republican, likened the health care law to a goat that had been let loose in a person\u2019s home. \u201cNow for six years, that goat has been messing in and destroying my house,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to renovate my house, but before I can, I have to get the goat out of the house before it does any more damage. It makes no sense to start fixing up my house until we get the goat out. \u201d Voting for the measure on Friday, Mr. Ferguson said, would get rid of the goat.'"}, "time": 1742628470.1557992}
