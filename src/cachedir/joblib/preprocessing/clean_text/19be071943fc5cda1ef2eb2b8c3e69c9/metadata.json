Trump\u2019s presidential bid down the road, and he described the candidate as lacking knowledge in a number of areas in an interview released on Friday. The comments from Mr. McConnell, in an interview with the \u201cMasters in Politics\u201d podcast on Bloomberg Politics, came as Republicans down the ballot continue to face questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the   federal judge overseeing a case against Trump University as \u201cMexican. \u201d Mr. McConnell has been pointed in his criticism of those remarks. It was the first time, though, that Mr. McConnell offered anything less than an ironclad response of sticking with Mr. Trump, despite the numerous controversies that the presumptive Republican nominee has instigated. Asked if there was a line that Mr. Trump could cross that would prompt Mr. McConnell to rescind his endorsement, Mr. McConnell demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate about what he might say or what I might do,\u201d said the senator from Kentucky. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s pretty clear. I\u2019ve been very clear publicly about how I think he ought to change directions, and I hope that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see. \u201d This week, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the Senate, withdrew his endorsement of Mr. Trump over the remarks about Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel. Senator Lindsey Graham, who has not endorsed Mr. Trump, urged other Republicans to follow Mr. Kirk\u2019s lead. At another point, Mr. McConnell said that he was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with supporting Mr. Trump at the moment, suggesting that the candidate would face checks and balances that could curtail him should he get elected. \u201cFor all of his obvious shortcomings, Donald Trump is certainly a different direction, and I think if he is in the White House he\u2019ll have to respond to the    world which elected him, and the things that we believe in,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cSo I\u2019m comfortable supporting him. \u201d But he condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of preparedness, and said that he will need to factor that into his choice of running mate. \u201cHe needs someone highly experienced and very knowledgeable because it\u2019s pretty obvious he doesn\u2019t know a lot about the issues,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cYou see that in the debates in which he\u2019s participated. It\u2019s why I have argued to him publicly and privately that he ought to use a script more often  \u2014   there is nothing wrong with having prepared texts. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562405.0892127}
