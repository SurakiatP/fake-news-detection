The diver, Chan Ming, a   advertising executive who is a scuba instructor in his spare time, was among about 20 people on a   tour from Ensenada, Mexico, to Guadalupe Island. The main purpose was to see sharks, and Mr. Chan, 51, jumped into the water on Oct. 5 with a camera. He entered the cage hoping for a  . During the encounter, which was caught on video and then shared across the internet, a juvenile great white leaps for a piece of tuna.   the shark slaps against the bars of the cage, entering and thrashing while Mr. Chan is trapped inside. A tour employee immediately leaps forward to open the top hatch of the cage to allow the shark to escape. About 20 harrowing seconds later, the shark finally wriggles free, breaching as it finds its way back to open water in the Pacific Ocean. The footage was captured by the operator of the Gabe and Garrett YouTube page, an   account for children. The boys\u2019 father, who identified himself as Brian but would not give his last name out of concern for the safety of his children, said in an interview that two divers had left the water about two minutes before the encounter, which was \u201cgood timing on their part. \u201d In a telephone interview, Mr. Chan said he did not have time to take photos of the encounter, and could not see what was happening as the shark was thrashing because the cage was rattling so sharply. He said he was not afraid to be trapped inside the cage with the shark. \u201cHonestly at that moment I don\u2019t have time to get afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the shark is coming, a very sharp moment, two seconds. \u201d Instead, he focused on staying inside the cage. When the shark finally breached, Mr. Chan pulled himself up and out of the cage. In the end, he still had three more days of diving left. Did he go into the water again? \u201cThe next day,\u201d Mr. Chan said. \u201cI felt so lucky,\u201d he added, \u201cwhy would I be scared?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564298.2734149}
