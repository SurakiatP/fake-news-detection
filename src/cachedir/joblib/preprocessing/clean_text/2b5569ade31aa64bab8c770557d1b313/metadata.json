There was that time as a youngster when he nearly broke his neck playing in a hammock. Or when he wrecked his brother\u2019s Mustang after begging him for the keys. Or the time he broke his arm during motorcycle training for the Police Department. It was his fearlessness and desire to serve his country that led Mr. Thompson to join the Marines and, after returning from deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq, to become a police officer, his longtime pastor, Rick Lamb, said Wednesday. So it came as no surprise to people close to Mr. Thompson, 43, that when gunfire started ringing out during a protest here last Thursday, he was one of the officers running toward the shooting. This time, however, Mr. Thompson suffered the ultimate injury. He and four other officers were killed when a black Army veteran upset over killings by the police across the country opened fire, targeting white officers, the authorities said. The grim process of moving forward from one of America\u2019s deadliest mass shootings of police officers began on Wednesday when Mr. Thompson, who worked for the Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police, and Sr. Cpl. Lorne Ahrens of the Dallas Police Department were given their final   during funerals that were by turns emotional and quippy. A private service was held Wednesday for another Dallas officer, Sgt. Michael J. Smith, and a public memorial is planned on Thursday. Services for the fourth victim, Officer Michael Krol, will be Friday, and the funeral for the fifth victim, Officer Patrick Zamarripa, will be Saturday. Even as mourners, including hundreds of officers who came here from across the country, took tentative steps forward, they acknowledged the cathartic backdrop against which Wednesday\u2019s services took place: in a country rived by a debate over race and policing, upended by vast protests and nationwide soul searching. \u201cThough I\u2019m heartbroken and hurt, I\u2019m going to put on my badge and my uniform and return to the street along with all of my brothers and sisters in blue,\u201d Mr. Thompson\u2019s wife, Emily, who is also a police officer, said with a shaky but steely voice. \u201cTo the coward that tried to break me and my brothers and sisters, know your hate made us stronger. \u201d The couple had married about two weeks before the shooting. Only about 12 hours before Mr. Thompson was shot, his wife had filed their marriage license with government authorities, Mr. Lamb said. About 8:15 that night, the couple spoke on the phone. \u201cMy shift\u2019s over in 45 minutes, and then I\u2019ll be home,\u201d Mr. Thompson told his wife, according to Mr. Lamb. \u201cHe told her he loved her, and that\u2019s the last time that he ever spoke to her. \u201d Mr. Thompson leaves behind six children from a previous marriage. He was a music enthusiast who occasionally played guitar and would send his children songs with his cellphone to see if they could recognize the tune. The funeral reflected the nuances of the conversation on race and policing that has enveloped the country. The service was held in the Potter\u2019s House, the West Dallas megachurch where T. D. Jakes is the pastor. A noticeably diverse cast of officers filled the seats. Among them was Emily Thompson\u2019s patrol partner, a black man, who stood next to her as she read her words of remembrance about her husband. As Brenda Lee, who is black and works for the Transit Police, sang \u201cI Can Only Imagine,\u201d her voice resonated with a gospel flair. Several people stood, some raising their arms in worship, when she hit the long notes. And among the final speakers was the chief of the Transit Police, James D. Spiller, who is black. It was a diverse showing in remembrance of a white man from a small town 55 miles south of Dallas. \u201cBrent respected and loved all people, regardless of what color they were, where they came from,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. But the reality was that Wednesday\u2019s services were taking place beneath a cloud of national racial tension, and about 30 miles away from Mr. Thompson\u2019s funeral, F. B. I. agents in camouflage and tactical gear were providing security outside Mr. Ahrens\u2019s service in Plano. Friends and colleagues of Mr. Ahrens, 48, recalled his seemingly quixotic journey from his native Los Angeles to Dallas. He drove here with nothing but his dog and a few possessions stuffed into his Toyota. He slept on the floor of his apartment early in his police training because he had no bed. When a woman named Katrina first approached him, he was too shy to speak. She later became his wife, and they went on to have two children. \u201cYour dad was doing what he was supposed to do,\u201d the Rev. Rick Owen, senior pastor of Mr. Ahrens\u2019s church, Pathway Church in Burleson, Tex. told the fallen officer\u2019s    daughter and    son during the service. The Dallas mayor and police chief sat in attendance as Mr. Ahrens was remembered as a lover of guns and heavy metal music who did not know his own strength. He once bent a police car door on accident during training. \u201cWhen you were on the radio screaming for help, you could count on Lorne to be the first to be there,\u201d Sr. Cpl. Debbie Taylor said. The funerals drew officers from places as   as South Carolina and Indiana. \u201cAt times like this, we feel like we stand alone,\u201d said Rick Keys, a lieutenant with the North Charleston, S. C. Police Department, who drove 15 hours with three of his colleagues to attend Mr. Thompson\u2019s funeral. \u201cIt means a lot to the families to see the officers come from so far. \u201d Robert Parker, the assistant chief of police in Watauga, a city about 30 miles west of Dallas, said he hoped that this could be an opportunity for police departments and the communities they serve to come together. \u201cWe have a long way to go before we get where we need to be,\u201d he said after Mr. Thompson\u2019s funeral. \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve talked to my wife about, and many others, is everybody on all sides of this, whether it\u2019s Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, everyone needs to sit back and gain all the truth and the facts of each case before they pass judgment. If we do that and then we have an open dialogue and sit down and look at each other\u2019s points of view, maybe we can go through this without further violence. \u201d After Mr. Thompson\u2019s funeral, hundreds of officers lined up outside, saluting his coffin as an honor guard fired off a gun salute. The department then did what is known as a last call. A radio dispatcher, over a loudspeaker, called for Mr. Thompson, by his name and badge number, three times. When he did not answer, she said a final goodbye. \u201cWe will miss you, Brent,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will never be forgotten. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561742.467663}
