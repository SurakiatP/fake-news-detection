He has several names in mind, names that will literally change America and CNN doesn\u2019t like this at all. Well, too bad! VIA Conservative 101 According to Politico , some of those names include Gingrich for Secretary of State, Mnuchin, a 17 year veteran of Goldman Sachs for Treasure Secretary and Mayor Giuliani for Attorney General. And of course Sheriff David Clarke as the Homeland Security Secretary. He has been an incredible patriotic American and leader in Blue Lives Matter. CNN was terrified by this. \u201cI think the one major flag I have is that someone like Sheriff Clarke would be considered as his Homeland Security secretary? Someone who I very much see as if he\u2019s not a terrorist inciting terrorism?\u201d said CNN commentator Angela Rye. \u201cIf people are afraid of Sheriff Clarke, afraid of the policies which he represents, I think that\u2019s terrorism,\u201d she said. This of course, makes no sense. You can\u2019t just call people who disagree with you terrorists. Check out the video below and see for yourself. \\nNow, this makes me wonder\u2026 what gives Angela the right to call an honest person like Sheriff Clarke a terrorist? Is it jealousy? \\nYou can\u2019t call someone a terrorist just because you don\u2019t agree with them. It\u2019s absurd! \\nWhat are your thoughts on this?
