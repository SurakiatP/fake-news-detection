S. House of Representatives, for suggesting Gingrich\u2019s criticism of former FBI Director Robert Mueller was tied to the appointment Gingrich\u2019s wife, Callista Gingrich, to the U. S. ambassadorship to the Vatican.  This is grotesque and fans the flames of rage among the unbalanced. What exactly is the price of an ambassadorship these days? https:  .   \u2014   Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) June 15, 2017,  Gingrich told host Jeanine Pirro his support for Trump had been a constant and that for Scarborough to have said that suggest he is a \u201cprostitute. \u201d \u201cNow we know to the degree of which Joe [Scarborough] is a prostitute that apparently he would do that,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. My record of being for Trump is clear. It\u2019s unending. I just wrote a book, \u2018Understanding Trump.\u2019 I am deeply committed to this presidency because I think we need to shake up Washington. By the way, when I ran in \u201912, it was very similar to Trump except I wasn\u2019t as good as he is. So there\u2019s a long continuum of my support for Reagan, to the \u2018Contract With America,\u2019 to Donald Trump. And I would challenge Joe Scarborough, who knows me pretty darn well, to be honest about this. \u201d (  The Right Scoop) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742564316.2853587}
