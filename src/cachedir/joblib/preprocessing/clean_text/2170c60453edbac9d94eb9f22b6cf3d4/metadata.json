One example often put forth by Taleb is the life and times of the Thanksgiving Turkey.\\nThe turkey spends the majority of its life enjoying daily feedings from a caring farmer. Weeks go by, and it\u2019s the same thing day-in-day-out for the Turkey. Free food. Open range grazing. Good times all around.\\nThe thinking turkey may even surmise that the farmer has a vested interest in keeping the turkey alive. For the turkey, it is a symbiotic relationship. \u201cThe farmer feeds me and keeps me happy, and I keep the farmer happy,\u201d says the turkey. \u201cThe farmer needs me, otherwise, why would he be taking care of me?\u201d\\nThis goes on for a 1,000 days.\\nThen, two days before Thanksgiving on Day 1,001, the farmer shows up again.\\nBut this time he doesn\u2019t come bearing food, but rather, he\u2019s wielding an ax.\\nThis is a black swan event \u2014 for the turkey.\\nBy definition, it is a high-impact, hard-to-predict, and rare event for the turkey, who not only never saw it coming, but never even contemplated the possibility that it could occur.\\nFor the farmer, on the other hand, this was not a black swan event. The farmer knew all along why he was feeding the turkey, and what the end result would be.\\nThe very nature of black swan events make them almost impossible to predict. The point of this parable is to put forth the idea that sometimes we are the Thanksgiving turkey and understanding this may make it easier to begin to, at the very least, contemplate the possibility of far-from-equilibrium events.\\nThis year, when you enjoy that drumstick or Turkey breast, give thanks to the latest victim of the black swan for being non-contemplative, otherwise, he may have bugged-out long ago and you\u2019d be eating a chicken instead.\\nEditor\u2019s Note: We\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank every one of you for visiting our web site.
