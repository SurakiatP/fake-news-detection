The confrontation began when a large group of organized protesters, holding banners identifying themselves as the Industrial Workers of the World, held a rally in front of the museum. Kaywin Feldman, the museum\u2019s director, said security camera footage showed two or three men apparently engaging in an argument with the protesters. When the men went into the museum, I. W. W. protesters followed them inside. A Minneapolis group that describes itself as part of the   movement said Tuesday that its members were the ones followed inside and attacked. The group  \u2014   which declined to name the members, citing safety concerns  \u2014   posted a statement online about the incident. \u201cWe were there only to meet a few new faces and enjoy the Minneapolis Institute of Art\u2019s beautiful collection,\u201d the group, Alt Right MN, stated. \u201cHowever, when we got there, the IWW protesters were waiting. We had no idea that it had anything to do with us until two of our members were attacked upstairs, simply for how they looked. \u201d Also on Tuesday, a group called the Twin Cities General Defense Committee of the I. W. W. posted its own account of the incident online, saying that it had shown up at the museum to disrupt plans for what it called a fascist,   rally. Two witnesses told The Star Tribune of Minneapolis that they had heard the   men yelling   provocations, and that one of the men was wearing a   or   symbol on his jacket. Attempts to reach the witnesses by phone and social media on Monday were unsuccessful. But Ms. Feldman said no such symbols were visible in the security footage, and she did not have any information from the museum\u2019s security guards about what the men had been yelling. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an indication of who they were,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was obvious that the I. W. W. fellows were going through the galleries looking for them, for their opponents. \u201d They finally found them in a gallery of   art with two English landscape paintings, French armchairs and a S\u00e8vres porcelain sculpture. A scuffle ensued in which an I. W. W. protester pinned one of the men to the ground and began hitting him. A female museum security guard intervened to protect the man. \u201cShe was terribly brave,\u201d Ms. Feldman said. \u201cAs you can imagine, our security officers are trained not to put themselves in harm\u2019s way ever. And so this was just a reaction on her part to protect another human. \u201d The fight was broken up before the police arrived, and no art was damaged, Ms. Feldman said. She added that the man who was hit declined to press charges. No one was arrested. \u201cWe\u2019re a free museum, and making the institution accessible is the value we hold most dear,\u201d Ms. Feldman said. \u201cWe will always maintain that, and we have no intention to profile visitors. But with this in mind, we will now look carefully for indicators of people we might need to keep an eye out for. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563840.3369808}
