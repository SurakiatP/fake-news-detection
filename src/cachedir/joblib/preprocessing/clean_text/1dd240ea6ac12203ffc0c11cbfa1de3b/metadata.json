Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/chelsea-clinton-being-groomed-to-buy.html While some pundits are declaring the Clinton political dynasty dead, sources tell us that it is far from over. Chelsea Clinton is being groomed for the New York seat held by Rep. Nita Lowey. Chelsea Clinton could run for the seat in NYC\u2019s 17th Congressional District once Lowey, a respected, 79-year-old career politician with nearly 30 years in office, decides to retire, we have exclusively learned. Lowey\u2019s district includes parts of Rockland and Westchester counties and, conveniently, Chappaqua, the Clinton family home base. Continuing the Clinton Crime Brand If you thought for one, fleeting second that the Clintons would just somehow walk away after Crooked Hillary\u2019s rejection by the American people, think again. There are many more billions to be made, and many more state favors to sell and trade. So the baton gets passed to Chelsea. Congresswoman Chelsea Clinton. Thanks for the Congressional seat, mom and dad! In August, Hillary and Bill Clinton purchased a home next door to their primary residence in Chappaqua for $1.16 million, which is intended for Chelsea, her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and their two children, Charlotte and Aidan. While Chelsea currently lives, and is registered to vote, in Manhattan, she could easily make Chappaqua her legal residence in order to run for Lowey\u2019s seat when it becomes vacant. A source told us: \u201cWhile it is true the Clintons need some time to regroup after Hillary\u2019s crushing loss, they will not give up. Chelsea would be the next extension of the Clinton brand. \u201cIn the past few years, she has taken a very visible role in the Clinton Foundation and on the campaign trail. \u201cWhile politics isn\u2019t the life Hillary wanted for Chelsea, she chose to go on the campaign trail for her mother and has turned out to be very poised, articulate and comfortable with the visibility.\u201d The source continued: \u201cThere has been a lot of speculation within New York Democratic circles about Lowey\u2019s retirement and Chelsea running for the seat. There is a belief that Chappaqua is a logical place for Chelsea to run, because it would be straightforward for her to raise money and build a powerful base.\u201d A spokesperson for Lowey \u2014 who is serving her 14th term in Congress and was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1988 \u2014 declined to comment. A spokesperson for Chelsea didn\u2019t get back to us. Clinton Cash \u2014 Official Documentary By Emily Smith  \""}, "time": 1742561861.8020334}
