Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) ignited a political firestorm Thursday night after he randomly brought up his Democratic rival\u2019s heritage after she touted her military experience during a debate. \\nRep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who is of mixed Thai and American descent, cited her military service as well as her family\u2019s when making the case against rushing into war. \\n\u201cI\u2019m a daughter of the American Revolution. I\u2019ve bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound,\u201c she said. \u201dBecause people are quick to sound the drums of war and I want to be there to say, \u2018This is what it costs, this is what you\u2019re asking us to do\u2019. Let\u2019s make sure the American people understand what we are engaging in.\u201d \\nWhen given a chance to respond, Kirk remarked, \u201cI had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.\u201d Illinois Senator Mark Kirk Made A Racist Remark About His Opponent\u2019s Heritage https://t.co/MmS5HnGEG7 pic.twitter.com/Q1bFnqviAG \\n\u2014 BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) October 28, 2016 \\nNo one, including the debate moderator, quite knew how to react. After a brief awkward silence, the moderator moved the discussion forward. Critics immediately branded the comment as \u201cracist\u201d and distasteful. \\nDuckworth lost both of her legs while serving as a pilot in the Army during the Iraq war. Her father also served in the U.S.army and her family\u2019s military service goes all the way back to the Revolutionary War, BuzzFeed reported .

Duckworth a war hero and honors her family\u2019s service to this country. But that\u2019s not what this debate was about. Rep. Duckworth lied about her legal troubles, was unable to defend her failures at the VA and then falsely attacked Senator Kirk over his record on supporting gay rights.\u201d \\nBut at that point, the damage was already done.
