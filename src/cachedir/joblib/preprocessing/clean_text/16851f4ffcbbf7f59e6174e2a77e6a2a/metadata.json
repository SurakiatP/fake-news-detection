[Douglas Cardinal, a Canadian architect who designed the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian and is a member of the Blackfoot tribe, filed suit in October that using the Cleveland team name \u201cIndians\u201d and the \u201cChief Wahoo\u201d logo and mascot during games at the Toronto Blue Jays Rogers Centre violates discrimination laws under the Ontario Human Rights Code.   Cardinal\u2019s objective is to ban the Cleveland Indians from donning their team name or logos at MLB games played in Toronto. \u201cAs an Indigenous person, I am encouraged that the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal has accepted jurisdiction over my complaint and agrees that it can proceed to a hearing,\u201d said Cardinal in an official statement.  \u201cUnfortunately, the consciousness of genocide and apartheid continues to be fostered by the insensitive use of demeaning and degrading symbols, mocking indigenous peoples,\u201d Cardinal added. \u201cThis must cease in order for reconciliation to have any meaning and substance. \u201d On May 23, according to a document filed at canlii. com, Tribunal adjudicator   Pickel ruled that Cardinal had standing to bring suit against the Indians and Rogers. \u201cIf the applicant was either not indigenous, not a baseball fan, and not otherwise interested in attending games at the Rogers Centre, my finding on the issue of standing would have been different,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn my view, the applicant has asserted a sufficient personal interest to have standing to bring this application. \u201d  You can read Pickel\u2019s  full ruling here. If Cardinal should win, the team would have to remove the name \u201cIndians\u201d and the Wahoo imagery from their uniforms when playing games in Canada.  Bill Baer at NBC Sports reports that MLB fans are the oldest of all sports fans. When they die off, younger fans will be   with Cardinal and the notion that such mascots and imagery are racist. \u201cMLB will have trouble courting them with racist iconography,\u201d he writes.  \u201cEven if the humanity argument doesn\u2019t persuade one \u2014  which it should, full stop \u2014  the business angle should be convincing enough to anyone involved in fighting this battle to preserve Chief Wahoo that it\u2019s a lost cause. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564415.1282604}
