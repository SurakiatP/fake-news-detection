J. this morning, killing at least one person, injuring more than 100 others, and leaving commuters in horror and panic. With a deadly explosion and a bus crash in our rearview mirror, this hasn\u2019t been the easiest of weeks. But what an example of our region coming together. Yet again. Michael Larson, a New Jersey Transit employee who was at the station at the time of the crash, crawled on all fours to pull people out of a train car. Another witness who was on the train, Amy Krulewitz, said that as soon as the accident occurred, people in her car were immediately checking on one another. Facebook quickly instituted a safety check to help those involved let their friends and family members know they were O. K.

I looked around for a ledge on which I could place my coffee, to no avail. Then I noticed a woman leaving the same Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, with the same dilemma and the same puzzled look on her face.
