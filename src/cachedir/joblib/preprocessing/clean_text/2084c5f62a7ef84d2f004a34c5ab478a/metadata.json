Fee Meynell and Ella Crockett plopped their bags down for the      ride. Ms. Meynell, 23, was lively and talkative. Ms. Crockett, 21, was conserving her energy, having recently spent four days sick in bed. \u201cI\u2019m very fragile,\u201d she said, slumping over a table. Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett are \u201cSeasonnaires,\u201d the term the British clothing company Jack Wills uses for its summertime brand ambassadors. They had been chosen from 3, 000 applicants and sent to live for two months in a location with a Jack Wills shop for Ms. Crockett, it was Nantucket, for Ms. Meynell, Martha\u2019s Vineyard. \u201cWhen I applied, it was a pipe dream,\u201d Ms. Meynell said. \u201cYou never expect to get it, do you?\u201d She recalled that as a teenager she had a poster in her bedroom of Jack Wills Seasonnaires jumping up and down in front of a lighthouse. Her relationship with \u201cJack,\u201d as she called the brand, had been \u201cvery  . \u201d \u201cI probably took it quite far,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d go out in Jack Wills pajamas. \u201d Jack Wills is still   in America, one of those preppyish brands like Vineyard Vines or Kiel James Patrick that\u2019s a shared secret among the   crowd from Annapolis, Md. to Kennebunkport, Me. But in Britain, it has been popular for years. At the suburban London high school that Ms. Meynell attended, the cool kids wore Jack Wills hoodies, crews and chinos. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have Jack, you were no one,\u201d she said. Ms. Crockett, who also grew up in suburban London and has modeled for Jack Wills, nodded in agreement, saying: \u201cAt my school, you put your lunch in a    Jack Wills bag. You wanted the bedding. You wanted the knickers. You were obsessed. \u201d Both remembered fawning over the brand\u2019s catalogs, which, similar to those of Abercrombie  Fitch, feature attractive young men and women cavorting at sporting events or falling into bed in their underwear,   fight. (The sexualized imagery in the spring 2016 catalog  \u2014   and its winking promotional copy about \u201cmidnight mischief\u201d  \u2014   led it to be banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, a British media watchdog.) On the ferry ride, both women wore the brand they have been relentlessly promoting. Ms. Meynell had on the red Bagley shorts and a white Eccleston   while Ms. Crockett was dressed in black Fernham   jeans and the Hoyle tank. Her overnight things were stuffed into an      duffel bag. They were returning after a night in Chatham, a town on Cape Cod that also has a Jack Wills store. Three weeks into their branded summer, the women were still adjusting to New England, which neither had ever visited before, and to their    social schedule, in keeping with the corporate hashtag mantra to #livelifelouder. \u201cMealtime is not a thing when you\u2019re a Seasonnaire,\u201d Ms. Meynell said. \u201cI eat at 2 a. m. when I get home. \u201d And the partying and brand promotion doesn\u2019t end at the bar. \u201cWe have so much alcohol in the house,\u201d Ms. Crockett said. When Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett were selected for the Seasonnaire program, they were sent for training at Jack Wills\u2019s London headquarters, where they met with the   and chief executive, Pete Williams. Now 42, Mr. Williams, who is British, started the brand at 24, an age when he had already realized, he said, that his best years were behind him. Jack Wills was about capturing (or recapturing) the rush of college and   youth. \u201cYou have all the amazing independence of being an adult, but haven\u2019t lost the na\u00efvet\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Williams said from Britain by phone. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a boss, a wife or husband, kids or a mortgage and the responsibilities that grind us all down. That spirit is intoxicating, and you don\u2019t realize it until later. \u201d Founded in 1999, the brand\u2019s visual and spiritual DNA comes from Salcombe, a preppy nautical resort town in southwest England similar to Nantucket that Mr. Williams once visited with a college girlfriend. As for the term Seasonnaire, it\u2019s based on a tradition in Europe in which students would take a gap year between high school and college and go work at, say, a ski resort in the French Alps. \u201cIt was an amazing time in your life, lots of fun working and partying,\u201d Mr. Williams said. The job of a Jack Wills Seasonnaire, as Ms. Crockett and Ms. Meynell learned, involves going out to bars, beaches and restaurants, meeting lots of people and spreading the word about Jack in the friendliest, most organic way possible. So far, in an expansion push into America begun in 2010, the brand has opened stores in wealthy enclaves and university towns on the East Coast like Westport, Conn. and Boston. Seasonnaires also work in the stores and organize promotional parties like the Croquet and Cocktails event that was held at the Chatham Bars Inn. Being a Seasonnaire is a pretty good gig. The company pays their room and board, allowed them to go on a shopping spree at its Boston location and puts them up at houses set aside for Jack Wills employees. They get around in vintage Land Rovers, or \u201cLandies,\u201d as the women called them, painted in the company colors, blue and pink. They also have expense accounts to go with salaries they would not disclose. Both Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett were paired for the summer with male American counterparts who share the rental houses and job responsibilities. Splashing in the waves, sipping champagne on yachts, having sunset dinner parties right on the beach: A Seasonnaire\u2019s life is like a catalog shoot come to life. Mr. Williams encourages the young people he ships off to what he called \u201cemotionally rich locations\u201d in America to say yes to everything. During their orientation in London, Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett heard the legend of Red Rainey, a   Seasonnaire of a few summers back who had made a name for himself in company lore as a nonstop party animal, always up for anything. \u201cI remember Pete said, \u2018Be like Red,\u2019\u201d Ms. Crockett recalled. Mr. Williams sounded as if he wouldn\u2019t mind trading places with the Seasonnaires in his employ. \u201cThey make me jealous, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to live my life vicariously through them. \u201d By early August, Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett had each compiled a personal highlight reel of good times: a blur of boat trips, barhopping,   conversations with strangers and fast friends and sunbaked days patrolling the islands in the Landies. Ms. Meynell and her American counterpart, Sean Fegan, started a biweekly Jack Wills party at the Loft, a club on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. One night she danced until 1:30 a. m. then invited everyone back to the rental house for pizza. \u201cIt got to 5 a. m. and we said, \u2018Should we get a cab to the beach and watch the sunrise? \u2019\u201d Ms. Meynell said. \u201cWe climbed one of those lifeguard stands and watched the sun come up. \u201d \u201cWe went to bed feeling very knackered,\u201d she said, using a British term for exhausted. In Nantucket, Jack Wills sponsors a dance party on Mondays at the Chicken Box, where on a recent night Ms. Crockett stood on stage laughing as she tossed preppy merchandise into the crowd as if tossing chum to sharks. \u201cIt\u2019s literally like I\u2019ve got a million dollars in my hand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. \u201d The Seasonnaires are either embraced or derided on Nantucket and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, depending on one\u2019s age and tolerance for red Solo cups. It\u2019s not uncommon for Ms. Meynell to meet people, she said, who have been partying in the house where she is staying, or even in her bedroom, during previous summers. Ms. Crockett, meanwhile, was convinced that the Nantucket police see the    Landy coming a mile away and get their summons books ready. She was making quite an impression herself Ms. Meynell said \u201cthe sushi guy\u201d at a Nantucket restaurant they frequented had a crush on Ms. Crockett. Despite ample suitors, both women said they had not entered into a summer romance. The main man in their lives, it seems, was Jack. For part of her time on Nantucket, Ms. Crockett had worked without her Seasonnaire partner, Jon Wormser, who had to go home for family reasons. Ms. Meynell regularly took the ferry over from the Vineyard to help out for instance, during the Monday parties at the Chicken Box. Mr. Fegan, a muscled surfer with long hair and a friendly Labradorish manner, has been Ms. Meynell\u2019s steady partner on the Vineyard, helping plan a dinner party one Saturday and translating American slang for her. Mr. Fegan, a Maryland native with only passing knowledge of Jack Wills before this summer, theorized that he was picked partly because he attends college in North Carolina. Like a seed pod, he would spread the brand to the South. Mr. Fegan was heading into his senior year in the fall, vaguely dreading it. \u201cI\u2019m 22,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, I don\u2019t want to graduate. \u201d The culmination of the summer for the Seasonnaires, as well as for many other people on the islands, is the   festivities held in   on Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Meynell and Ms. Crockett were busy planning the Jack Wills  . At the end of the month, Ms. Crockett planned to visit New York before returning to Britain and her senior year of college. Ms. Meynell\u2019s Seasonnaire experience was more bittersweet: It marked a goodbye to carefree summers. Having already graduated from college in June, she will return to London to a new apartment and her first adult job. \u201cWhen I\u2019m older and have children I can say, \u2018O. K. this summer, my last summer, I did this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Meynell said. \u201c\u2018I have said yes to everything, lived up to that, pushed my boundaries. \u2019\u201d She\u2019ll also be flying home with bags of Jack Wills clothes bought with her earnings.'"}, "time": 1742562832.1048653}
