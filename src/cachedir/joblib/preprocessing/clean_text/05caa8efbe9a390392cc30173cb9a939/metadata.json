Maybe it was his response, the beatific expression on his face, eyes almost closed, head tilted toward her shoulder. Maybe it was the moment: tenderness at a time when presidential politics has become a festival of cruelty. But when Michelle Obama hugged former President George W. Bush on Saturday, at a ceremony to open the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the image quickly took flight online. However one chose to interpret it  \u2014   and overinterpretation is a hazard in such exercises  \u2014   it became an instant metaphor. Some saw the lost virtue of civility in politics others, the unlikely friendships that blossom at the rarefied heights of public life. To critics on the left, it was a shameful case of political amnesia by the wife of a president who spent years cleaning up the mess left by his predecessor. Mrs. Obama and Mr. Bush have had a few such memorable moments. In July in Dallas at a memorial service for five police officers killed by an Army veteran, the two held hands while singing \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic. \u201d When Mr. Bush began swaying to the music, Mrs. Obama gamely let him swing her arm back and forth. At one point, as the choir sang \u201cglory, glory hallelujah,\u201d he turned to her in a burst of enthusiasm, causing the first lady to crack up, despite the solemnity of the occasion. In June 2012, when Mr. Bush returned to the White House for the unveiling of his official portrait, he aimed a few wisecracks at President Obama. But he saved his best material for Mrs. Obama, reminding her that when British soldiers set fire to the White House in 1814, another first lady, Dolley Madison, rescued the portrait of the first George W.  \u2014   as in Washington. \u201cNow, Michelle,\u201d he said, gesturing to his own painting, \u201cif anything happens, there\u2019s your man. \u201d Some of these encounters are explained by proximity. When the Obamas and the Bushes appear in public together, protocol dictates that Mrs. Obama stand next to Mr. Bush. Some of it is a function of the former president\u2019s playful manner, which by all accounts has become more playful in his retirement. But some of it also has to do with the relationship between the couples, which current and former officials say has deepened over the past seven and a half years, both because of the shared bond of living in the White House and because of Mr. Bush\u2019s decorum as an  . \u201cPresident Bush was very gracious to us during the transition, and he has been unfailingly gracious and respectful since,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former adviser to Mr. Obama. He recalled the president telling him that the Bushes \u201chad taught him lessons in how to be a former president. \u201d Mr. Bush has studiously avoided criticizing Mr. Obama or his policies. And Mr. Bush has lent his presence to occasions that meant a lot to the president, like the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Selma, Ala. when Mr. Obama delivered what some believe was the finest speech of his presidency, on race relations in the United States. Mrs. Obama sat next to Mr. Bush on that day, too, frequently leaning over to talk or share a laugh with him. Mrs. Obama\u2019s rapport with Laura Bush is less playful, but Mrs. Obama\u2019s aides say it is no less genuine. In early 2009, Mrs. Bush invited Mrs. Obama to visit the White House with her daughters, Malia and Sasha, for a private tour before her husband\u2019s inauguration. Mrs. Bush\u2019s daughters, Barbara and Jenna, showed the girls their new home, including good hiding places and banisters made for sliding. The two first ladies have appeared together regularly since, including this month at a conference at the National Archives to promote support for families of service members. In 2013, in Tanzania, Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Bush bonded during a conference on education for women and girls. \u201cI like this woman,\u201d the first lady said of Mrs. Bush. Mrs. Obama added that \u201cit\u2019s hard to find people who know what you\u2019re going through, who understand the burdens and the fears and the challenges. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a club,\u201d Mrs. Bush replied. \u201cA sorority, I guess. \u201d The fraternity of presidents is well documented, though some members are closer than others. Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush became famously chummy, with Mr. Bush inviting the man who defeated him to the family compound in Kennebunkport, Me. to \u201cplay golf, spend the night\u201d and \u201churdle the waves at breakneck speed,\u201d according to the book \u201cThe President\u2019s Club,\u201d by Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy. Mr. Clinton\u2019s relationship with Mr. Obama took longer to thaw, largely as a consequence of the bitter 2008 primary race between Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton. There were a few golf games, an   lunch at an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village, and, above all, Mr. Clinton\u2019s memorable speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2012 defending the president\u2019s economic record, after which Mr. Obama took to calling Mr. Clinton his \u201csecretary of explaining stuff. \u201d Now, Mr. Obama is campaigning vigorously for Mrs. Clinton to succeed him, cementing the political alliance between them. Paradoxically, Mr. Obama\u2019s relationship with the younger Mr. Bush has always seemed less complicated. Though Mr. Obama ran on his opposition to the war in Iraq  \u2014   and has never stopped deploring that war  \u2014   he appears to have an easy rapport with his predecessor. After the ceremony at the museum on Saturday, Mr. Bush was trying to take a photograph of himself with a family, only to find he could not fit everyone in the frame. The solution? He tapped Mr. Obama on the back, handed him the phone, and asked him to take the picture. As Mr. Obama was wrapping up his speech, he could not resist a gentle poke at his predecessor, who is known for his restlessness, laying odds on the length of his own remarks. \u201cEnough talk,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cPresident Bush was timing me. He had the   at 25\u201d minutes.'"}, "time": 1742561940.572562}
