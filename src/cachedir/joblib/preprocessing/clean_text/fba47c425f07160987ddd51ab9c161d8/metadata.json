Their story cited \u201cofficials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\u201d \\nLee and Klapper\u2019s article also included the statement crafted by Clinton campaign staffers in the email chain \u2014 that chain was one of thousands released by WikiLeaks from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s hacked Gmail account. \\nPodesta\u2019s emails suggest the Clinton campaign had a cozy relationship with many members of the media, including the AP. \\nIn one email chain, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden told Podesta to get the New York Times to cover Clinton favorably. \\nTanden said former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg met with Arthur Sulzberger, NYT\u2019s publisher, to alter coverage of him. \\nTanden told Podesta that \u201cwhen bloomberg was having problems w the times he called Arthur Schulzburger and asked for coffee.\u201d \\n\u201cHe made the case that they were treating him like a billionaire dilettante instead of Third term mayor,\u201d Tanden wrote. \u201cIt changed the coverage moderately but also aired the issues in the newsroom so people were more conscious of it.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563375.8057792}
