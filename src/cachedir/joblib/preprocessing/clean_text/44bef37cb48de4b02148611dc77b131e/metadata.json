The march, which protesters called \u201cthe taking of Caracas,\u201d was organized by political opponents of the country\u2019s ruling leftists. The marchers took over a major highway and several avenues in Caracas, the nation\u2019s capital, and poured into the city\u2019s plazas in an effort to gain momentum for a referendum to recall Mr. Maduro. But the discontent was far greater than mere political frustration in a country that has spiraled into economic ruin. Some protesters traveled for hours from parts of Venezuela where they said they could no longer find enough food. Others said they could not find work, or that their cities were plagued by violence and suffering from a lack of government presence. Ivonne Mej\u00edas, 42, who wore a headband of yellow, blue and red, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, said the situation had become so difficult that she had not been able to bake birthday cakes for her children this year. Her family of four gets by on just $25 a week, Ms. Mej\u00edas said, and she has taken to making pi\u00f1atas to earn extra money. \u201cSometimes I want to kill myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI am frustrated, I am out of control, I am fighting with this world. This isn\u2019t my life. My soul splits in two when my kids beg for something  \u2014   for an ice cream, for a cookie  \u2014   and I can\u2019t give it to them. The most difficult thing is getting food. \u201d V\u00edctor Guilarte, 45, a mechanic from a Caracas suburb, said his work had vanished because his neighbors had become so poor they could not afford car repairs. Two weeks ago, he said, he visited his family in another state and found the situation even worse. \u201cI came back feeling destroyed  \u2014   they had no food,\u201d he said. \u201cI am tired of Maduro and his government, tired of crime, of hunger, of them telling us we have plenty to eat. I want a referendum, and if there is no referendum, I want him to resign. \u201d Mr. Maduro called on his supporters to take to the streets to stage a counterprotest, which drew crowds dressed in red, the color of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s leftist movement. The government also appeared to be cracking down on opponents. Days earlier, Daniel Ceballos, an opposition leader under house arrest on charges of inciting violence, was transferred to a jail cell. The government said he had planned to agitate for violence during the protest. Other opposition parties said members had either been arrested or gone into hiding. The authorities were also trying to tamp down foreign news media coverage. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group based in New York, said Wednesday that at least six journalists, including two from Al Jazeera and one from the French newspaper Le Monde, were barred from entering the country at the airport. Jim Wyss, a reporter for The Miami Herald, was allowed to enter, only to be forced to leave despite having a valid journalist visa, The Herald said. \u201cHe was doing his job when he was detained,\u201d said Aminda Marqu\u00e9s Gonzalez, the paper\u2019s executive editor. In a nation where the price of bread rises each week, along with the length of bakery lines, there has been no shortage of anger and desperation. The spring was characterized by droughts that stalled the nation\u2019s hydroelectric system. Blackouts rolled across the country, shutting off the lights in homes and emergency rooms. Mr. Maduro announced a cut in the workweek, to four days  \u2014   and later to two  \u2014   to conserve electricity. By summer, the nation\u2019s food supply was dwindling. The lines where Venezuelans had been accustomed to waiting for food turned into mobs that attacked bakeries, butcher shops and groceries. Delivery trucks were also attacked, their contents looted. The government ordered the food supply to be transported under armed guards. That dire situation led many to make long journeys to the capital to vent their complaints on Thursday. It was unclear how many participated in the march, and government officials had sought to forestall a large demonstration. Official roadblocks appeared Wednesday night at tunnels leading to Caracas, snarling traffic for hours as the police questioned passengers about their motives. Gerardo Molina, 21, a political science student from Zulia, a state in Venezuela\u2019s far west, made a   bus journey to join the march, a trip he said would have taken eight hours if the police were not monitoring the roads. Mr. Molina expressed the worry typical of many young Venezuelans who fear they may never inherit the rich petro state that had given their parents assurances of a comfortable life. Many young people have simply packed their bags and sought a future in other South American countries where the economies are more prosperous. \u201cYoung people are the ones who suffer the most because we feel we have no future,\u201d Mr. Molina said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this country, which is why I came to this march. \u201d Marly Torrealba, 37, a single mother, came by bus from Barlovento, a city once known for its cacao production. Ms. Torrealba complained that the government had abandoned the city to organized crime, and it was now rocked by killings, extortions and kidnappings. \u201cFarm workers have abandoned the crop because of crime,\u201d she said, \u201cand the criminals charge us protection money and rob everything in sight. \u201d While the Maduro government was the target of the protests, much seemed to be at stake for Venezuela\u2019s political opposition, which has struggled to translate the anger of the country\u2019s collapse into popular support. The opposition, riding a wave of discontent with Mr. Maduro, took over the National Assembly in January. Its members promised to enact   reforms that would revive the collapsing economy free a number of jailed political leaders and, most crucially, have a referendum that they said would remove Mr. Maduro from office within months. None of that has come to pass. Mr. Maduro, backed by a Supreme Court controlled by leftists, quickly managed to block the opposition\u2019s reform measures, overturning a bill to free political prisoners and using the courts to grant himself expanded presidential powers over the objections of Congress. Even the movement to recall him has been stalled. Opposition politicians promised to hold a vote this year on the referendum, which would force leftists to hold a new election if Mr. Maduro lost. However, the country\u2019s electoral body issued a timetable in which the vote would be held next year if Mr. Maduro were removed, his handpicked vice president would serve out the end of his term, which ends in 2019. Opposition leaders vowed on Thursday to redouble their efforts to remove the president. \u201cEveryone wake up Maduro if he can manage to sleep,\u201d Henrique Capriles, an opposition leader, wrote on Twitter. \u201cAll of Caracas is mobilizing itself for the referendum. To have a true homeland!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628577.8459294}
