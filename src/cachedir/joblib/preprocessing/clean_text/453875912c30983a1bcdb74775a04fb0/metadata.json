Initially, Cuban actually supported Trump\u2019s candidacy as someone independent from politics as usual, but as he (and we all) learned more about the dark past of The Donald\u2019s dirty dealings , sexual predations and more, the Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner threw himself wholeheartedly into the political arena, culminating with front row seats to the last presidential debate. \\nCuban sat down with local radio broadcasters to discuss rumors that his anti-Trump stance might cost him ticket sales for his NBA franchise. Mark Cuban probably, literally dropped the mic after this response: \\n\u201cYou know what, when it\u2019s all said and done, I\u2019d rather lose every penny than have Trump as president because I care more about the future of my family, my children than I do about my pocketbook. And so if it means we play to empty arenas, I\u2019m down with that.\u201d \\n\u201cMaybe I pick up some fans. Maybe I lose some fans. I don\u2019t know,. I\u2019ve heard it from both. I\u2019ve had people say \u2018there\u2019s no way I can support you. I can\u2019t go to another Mavs game.\u2019 And I\u2019ve had people say \u2018you know what? We\u2019re buying Mavs tickets.\u2019 What I\u2019ve heard more often than anything is, \u2018are you gonna be this way once the election\u2019s over?\u2019 And the answer is no. You\u2019ve known me forever Newy and I\u2019ve been apolitical my entire adult life and only because I know Donald and I know my feelings about what he would be like as president have I gotten this involved but come November 9, it\u2019s all Mavs all the time.\u201d \\nMark Cuban is a shining example of how any American should approach the political arena, which he does by placing integrity over ideology and the good of the country in his viewpoints above the simple view of his bank account\u2019s short term health. Luckily, Cuban is a franchisee in the NBA, which is far and away America\u2019s most progressive major sports league, which doesn\u2019t guarantee ongoing success, but does mean that the typical NBA fan values tolerance and diversity over racial segregation and hatred.'"}, "time": 1742628575.6913068}
