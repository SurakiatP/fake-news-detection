Nutrition just isn\u2019t that simple. \\nLet\u2019s take another look at those statements. \\nFatty foods make you fat. But ..a vocados and almonds are sources of healthful fats. \\nCarbs make you fat. But \u2026f ruits and vegetables are sources of carbohydrates. \\nIf you eat no more than 1,400 calories a day, you will lose weight. But \u2026 are the caloric needs of a 300 lb man and a 110 pound woman the same? \\nEat whatever you want, as long as it is in your daily calorie range. So. .. how does one determine how many calories he or she needs? Does this mean eating candy bars all day \u2013 as long as I stay in my calorie range \u2013 is okay? \\nLow fat and no-fat foods will help you lose weight. But\u2026does this mean I can eat low fat cookies and chips every day and still be healthy? \\nSugar-free foods will help you lose weight. So\u2026I can eat as much of them as I want? \\nCommon beliefs about diet and nutrition are often vague, misleading, and open to interpretation, and can lead to incorrect assumptions, as the examples above show. \\nAnd looking to experts for advice doesn\u2019t necessarily make things any easier. \\nIt would seem that, in this age of marvelous technological advancement and state-of-the-art research facilities, we would have the ability to find definitive solutions to the diet-related problems that plague us. \\nSo, why don\u2019t we? \\nResearch Challenges \\nIn a piece for The New York Times titled Why Nutrition Is So Confusing , science and health journalist Gary Taubes explored this question. \\nSince the 1960s, nutrition science has been dominated by two conflicting observations. One is that we know how to eat healthy and maintain a healthy weight. The other is that the rapidly increasing rates of obesity and diabetes suggest that something about the conventional thinking is simply wrong. In 1960, fewer than 13 percent of Americans were obese, and diabetes had been diagnosed in 1 percent. Today, the percentage of obese Americans has almost tripled; the percentage of Americans with diabetes has increased sevenfold. \\nI\u2019m reminded of a quote that is often attributed to Albert Einstein: \\nThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. \\nTaubes goes on to explain that in 1960, fewer than 1,100 articles on obesity and diabetes were published in medical literature. As of 2014, over 600,000 articles have been published that attempt to provide useful data on these health conditions. \\nYet, here we are, with higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related health conditions than ever. \\nIt is possible, Taubes says, that the ever-increasing number of studies and books on dieting, obesity, and diabetes are \u201cthe noise generated by a dysfunctional research establishment.\u201d \\nScience \u2013 nutrition science in particular \u2013 has limitations, he explains: In nutrition, the hypotheses are speculations about what foods or dietary patterns help or hinder our pursuit of a long and healthy life. The ingenious and severe attempts to refute the hypotheses are the experimental tests \u2014 the clinical trials and, to be specific, randomized controlled trials. Because the hypotheses are ultimately about what happens to us over decades, meaningful trials are prohibitively expensive and exceedingly difficult. It means convincing thousands of people to change what they eat for years to decades. Eventually enough heart attacks, cancers and deaths have to happen among the subjects so it can be established whether the dietary intervention was beneficial or detrimental. \\nNutrition research also suffers from funding issues. Pharmaceutical companies and the like do not benefit from such studies, so they (understandably) do not want to pay for them. There\u2019s no financial incentive to fund research on the benefits of whole foods. \\nAs a result, Taubes says, \u2026we have a field of sort-of-science in which hypotheses are treated as facts because they\u2019re too hard or expensive to test, and there are so many hypotheses that what journalists like to call \u201cleading authorities\u201d disagree with one another daily. \\nIn the article\u2019s conclusion, Taubes says our current situation is unacceptable, and asks that we challenge ourselves to do what it takes to find answers. Obesity and diabetes are epidemic, and yet the only relevant fact on which relatively unambiguous data exist to support a consensus is that most of us are surely eating too much of something. My vote is sugars and refined grains; we all have our biases. (Author\u2019s note: I am inclined to agree with Taubes regarding sugars and grains\u2026at least for now.) \\nEven when funding for studies IS available, problems are common, as Julia Belluz tells us in her Vox piece titled I asked 8 researchers why the science of nutrition is so messy. Here\u2019s what they said. Take the Women\u2019s Health Initiative, which featured one of the biggest and most expensive nutrition studies ever done. As part of the study, women were randomly assigned to two groups: One was told to eat a regular diet and the other a low-fat diet. They were then supposed to follow the diet for years. The problem? When researchers collected their data, it was clear that no one did what they were told. The two groups basically had followed similar diets. \u201cThey spent billions of dollars,\u201d says Walter Willett, a Harvard physician and nutrition researcher, \u201cand they never tested their hypothesis.\u201d \\nAs most people who have tried to stick to any sort of weight loss protocol can testify, humans just aren\u2019t good at sticking with a diet for more than a few days without slipping. This trait makes short-term studies easier to conduct, but those kinds of studies don\u2019t measure long-term results. We can use the results of short-term studies to infer what long-term health effects may occur, but that requires a lot of guessing and assumption-making. \\nIt is also difficult (if not impossible) to control for what scientists call \u201cconfounding factors.\u201d Here\u2019s an example : Say you wanted to compare people who eat a lot of red meat with fish eaters over many decades. One hitch here is that these two groups might have other differences as well. (After all, they weren\u2019t randomly assigned.) Maybe fish eaters tend to be higher-income or better-educated or more health-conscious, on average \u2014 and that\u2019s what\u2019s leading to the differences in health outcomes. Maybe red meat eaters are more likely to eat lots of fatty foods or smoke. \\nPeople are diverse, and so are food sources and foods themselves \u2013 factors which further complicate research. Animal studies have limitations, because, well, animals aren\u2019t humans, and have vast biological and lifestyle differences. \\nEpidemiology, or the study of the patterns and causes of disease, is extremely difficult to do, as Kamal Patel, director at Examine.com , told Lifehacker : Nutritional epidemiology is a really, really tough thing to study. Harder than most other areas of health. Much harder than it sounds. Some people think \u201cOh nutrition! I know about food and nutrition! That\u2019s much easier than some analyzing some obscure medication that I can\u2019t even pronounce.\u201d Wrong. Medication effects can be complex, but nutritional epidemiology makes that look like child\u2019s play. \u2026 It\u2019s easy to see how the public can get mixed messages. Research results are notoriously unpredictable, since only some of the total number of studies get published. Studies have a higher chance of getting published if they show positive results, and food and supplement manufacturers can keep funding trials until one gets published. Nutrients interact with each other, so the effects of any one nutrient are hard to predict, let alone the effect of any one food in the midst of a diet comprised of dozens or hundreds of foods. So while I don\u2019t agree with everything Michael Pollan says, his message is generally on point: \u201cNutritionism\u201d is bound to fail. If you obsess about your diet and individual nutrients, you not only lose the benefit of the occasional cronut or Thanksgiving dinner, but you lose the forest for the trees. Natural foods are what\u2019s healthy, nutrients and the controversies they cause are what keeps research dollars flowing and flip-flops popping up every couple weeks. It\u2019s important to get nutrients, but it\u2019s wise to get them mostly through food, and only after that supplement what you need in a very targeted manner. \\nPoorly designed research, different researchers studying the same effect but using different measurements and reporting outcomes differently, and researchers\u2019 tendency to selectively report positive or \u201cinteresting\u201d results all contribute to the already-murky nutrition science waters. \\nEven well-done studies can produce contradictory results. \\nBig Food Industry\u2019s Influence \\ndishonest clever marketing by the \u201cfood\u201d industry all contribute to the confusion. \\nWhen we have soft drink giant Coca-Cola creating its own \u201cresearch\u201d group and pasta companies paying for studies that \u201cshow\u201d their products are linked to lower BMI (woooo boy was THAT study flawed!), well\u2026you can see there are serious issues to contend with. \\n**** \\nMisinterpretation and Miscommunication of Findings \\nIf scientists can\u2019t come to a consensus, how can journalists possibly get it right and report it to us \u2013 the end users \u2013 accurately? \\nIn the article Cancer, the Media, and the Misinterpretation of Studies: A Cautionary Tale , I explained how typographical errors and misinterpretations of findings can lead to flurries of articles with misleading titles and flawed information being distributed to the masses. This is another way that nutritional myths are born. \\nTruthful claims can sound very similar to misleading or outright false ones, so pay close attention to wording. \\nScience writer and educator Beth Skwarecki provides us with an excellent example: Vitamins are magical substances that will make you more healthy if you are deficient!\u201d Well, yeah. That\u2019s actually true. \u201cVitamins are magical substances that will make you more healthy!\u201d Sounds similar, but it\u2019s not the same, and it\u2019s not true in most cases. Then you can substitute various other chemicals or superfoods for the word \u201cvitamins\u201d in that sentence. True claims and misleading ones sound very similar. \\n**** \\nAs you can see, it isn\u2019t that we are lacking information. On the contrary; we are drowning in it , much of it conflicting, some of it flawed, and a lot of it biased. \\nSo, what should we believe? \\nAll of the problems we discussed above might have left you feeling hopeless. \\nBut there\u2019s some light at the end of the tunnel. \\nThe following are generally accepted as true. \\nArtificial trans fats are dangerous . Saturated fat is not. You need fat in your diet . \\nEggs (especially the yolks) are very nutritious. Dietary cholesterol has not been proven to raise blood cholesterol or elevated risk of coronary heart disease. \\nButter , once believed to be terrible for health, is filled with vitamins, minerals, and beneficial fatty acids, and has anti-inflammatory properties. Raw, unpasteurized butter and cream contain a unique substance called the Wulzen factor , a hormone-like substance that prevents arthritis and joint stiffness. \\nCoffee , chocolate , and nuts \u2013 all also labeled unhealthful in the past \u2013 have been shown to have nutritional benefits. \\nSugary beverages (sodas and juices) can damage health and are linked to excess body fat and type 2 diabetes. \\nMost weight loss supplements will reduce your bank account, but not your body fat. \\nThe scale isn\u2019t very useful for measuring health or body composition, and neither is BMI . \\nYou don\u2019t have to count calories to lose weight. It works for some, but some people prefer tracking macronutrients like protein instead. \\nProcessed food package labels can be misleading and should be viewed with skepticism. Avoiding processed \u201cfoods\u201d as much as possible is a good idea, speaking of that. Studies show we eat far too much of them, and we are paying for it dearly. \\nA few more things to keep in mind\u2026 \\nWhen reading about diet and nutrition, expect to find conflicting information on most topics. Sometimes the issue truly hasn\u2019t been settled, and sometimes interpretation of the available data varies. \\nWatch out for confirmation bias : We tend to seek out information that confirms what we already believe instead of considering all points of view. If you have already formed an opinion about something, intentionally search for information that conflicts with your current belief. It will be uncomfortable, but it is crucial to getting at the truth \u2013 which is what you want after all, isn\u2019t it? \\nLook at the sources referenced in articles or books about nutrition. If there aren\u2019t any, be wary. Be VERY wary. \\nFunding by industry doesn\u2019t always mean a study is biased or flawed, but knowing who paid for the research is one factor you can use while weighing the findings (remember the Coca-Cola and pasta \u201cstudies\u201d we talked about earlier?). \\nTry searching public journals via PubMed or Google Scholar for studies. \\nParting Words \\nPerhaps keeping it simple is the best answer. Maybe we\u2019ve come full circle, and should go back to the basics. You really can\u2019t go wrong with whole foods, exercise, fresh air, sunshine, clean water, and quality sleep . \\nAnd of course, question everything \u2013 including what you read on this website. \\n\u201cBe careful about reading health books. Some fine day you\u2019ll die of a misprint.\u201d \u2015 Markus Herz'"}, "time": 1742563268.311705}
