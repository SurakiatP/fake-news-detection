Among the major brands that used their commercial time for social commentary was Airbnb, which had decided just last week to run an ad. In the ad, the company promoted its view of an open, multicultural world, reflecting its commitment to housing refugees.   revived an ad it ran during the 2014 Super Bowl featuring people singing a multilingual version of \u201cAmerica the Beautiful. \u201d It managed to strike a new chord with viewers, given the recent national conversation around immigration and diversity, and it prompted a flood of conversation on Twitter. \u201cI thought it was great for Coke to air an old ad because today it feels even more relevant than it did in 2014 when they first aired it,\u201d said Lynn Power, chief executive of J. Walter Thompson New York. It was a smart move from the brand to   an old message, she added, given that \u201cyou can\u2019t say it\u2019s a reactionary thing. \u201d In an interview before halftime during the game, Rob Schwartz, chief executive of TBWA\u2019\u2019Chiat\u2019\u2019Day New York, said, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that\u2019s screaming out here, it\u2019s diversity. \u201d He added: \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Is this trolling Trump?\u2019 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s trolling. It\u2019s a big smack in the face of \u2018dude, this is America. \u2019\u201d Still, for the most part, overtly political statements were few and far between  \u2014   by design. A   advertiser, 84 Lumber, had its initial proposal for a commercial rejected by Fox last month for being \u201ctoo controversial\u201d because it showed a   mother and daughter confronting a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The company edited its spot to remove the wall and directed users to see the end of its commercial online. Budweiser spent days telling the news media that its ad was not a response to President Trump\u2019s recent immigration crackdown. The company\u2019s commercial featured the journey of one of its founders to the United States from Germany in the 1800s and the discrimination he overcame on his way to success. The hashtag #BoycottBudweiser trended on Twitter early on Sunday evening, apparently started by people who disliked the ad. But it was then used by others to defend Budweiser and mock the people who were boycotting the ad. Carl Marci, chief neuroscientist at Nielsen, the TV ratings company, said, \u201cIf you make people think too much or get too serious during a game where people are really looking to be entertained, you\u2019re taking a risk. \u201d That risk can pay off, though. Audi\u2019s ad went viral before the game, having passed five million views on YouTube as of Friday. It was narrated by a father asking pointed questions about what to tell his young daughter one day as she competed in a cart race, such as, \u201cDo I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets?\u201d As she won the race, he reflected that perhaps he would be able to \u201ctell her something different. \u201d The commercial ended with text including a line saying that Audi of America is \u201ccommitted to equal pay for equal work. \u201d But escapism and sentimentality were the strategy for many advertisers as brands tried to provide an antidote to the weighty issues facing the country this year. Mr. Clean was unexpectedly portrayed as something of a sex symbol. Michelob Ultra used the theme song from \u201cCheers\u201d in its ad, which presented the label as a   beer. Justin Bieber showed off his dance moves for   while Avocados From Mexico jokingly used subliminal messaging to urge more avocado consumption. \u201cVery often on the Super Bowl, we see emotional advertising, or we see   advertising,\u201d said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. He added, \u201cAll the controversy in the country is making advertisers nervous about addressing big, significant issues, and in a polarizing time, it is safest to stick to the product and stick to lighthearted humor. \u201d Advertisers were willing to pay, on average, about $5 million for   spots during the Super Bowl this year  \u2014   or around $167, 000 per second  \u2014   and even more in promotional costs to reach the game\u2019s more than 100 million viewers. Many released the full ads or teasers online before Sunday while brands such as Snickers and Hyundai went the opposite route, producing their commercials during the game itself, which aired on Fox. Some were not impressed by the bulk of the ads that aired on Sunday, particularly given the rising cost of the commercials. \u201cComedy, celebrities and anthropomorphic creatures seem to be the   schtick,\u201d said Andrew Essex, the chief executive of Tribeca Enterprises and a former C. E. O. of the creative agency Droga5. \u201cAfter 50 years, half a century, it\u2019s all feeling a little formulaic,\u201d he added. \u201cI find myself, as someone who\u2019s not doing this anymore, wondering if this is the single greatest act of economic immolation on the planet. \u201d Others felt that the ads delivered. \u201cPeople want to see lighthearted things in the Super Bowl, especially at a time when there are so many big issues in the country,\u201d Mr. Calkins said.'"}, "time": 1742561733.7566326}
