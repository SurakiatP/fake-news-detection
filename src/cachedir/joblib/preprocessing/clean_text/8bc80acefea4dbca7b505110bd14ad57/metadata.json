They also asked the senators for more reliable funding, saying the uncertainty was hurting the defense industry. \\n\u201cNot only our people \u2013 our defense industry partners, too, need stability and longer-term plans to be as efficient and cutting-edge as we need them to be,\u201d Carter told the senators. Speaking about #sequester at #SASC , Ash Carter said it was unfair to \"defense industry partners\" too. pic.twitter.com/tQvNE4FWRc \u2014 Nebojsa Malic (@NebojsaMalic) September 22, 2016 \\nThe lawmakers were far less interested in the war against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) than about the future of the Syrian government, Iran\u2019s \u201cmalign influence,\u201d and \u201caggression\u201d by China and Russia \u2013 all ranked far ahead of terrorism on Carter and Dunford\u2019s list of security challenges. \\nThe Pentagon had \u201cno intention\u201d of sharing intelligence with Russia when it came to Syria, Dunford told the lawmakers unequivocally. Secretary Carter explained that the joint implementation councils envisioned by the ceasefire proposal negotiated in Geneva wouldn\u2019t share intelligence, just coordinate efforts \u2013 but that they were a moot point anyway, since the ceasefire was effectively dead. \\nREAD MORE: AP leaks one of the 5 Syria ceasefire docs, Moscow says always wanted them public \\nBoth the lawmakers and the Pentagon chiefs blamed that development on Russia, focusing on the alleged airstrike against the humanitarian convoy in east Aleppo while the US-led airstrike against the Syrian Army fighting IS in Deir ez-Zor went unmentioned. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the facts,\u201d Dunford said, when asked about the convoy attack by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut). \u201cIt was either the Russians or the regime,\u201d he added. \\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the Russians are responsible,\u201d whether directly or because they backed the government in Damascus, Dunford said, describing the attack as \u201can unacceptable atrocity.\u201d \\nCarter explained Dunford\u2019s logic in a response to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), saying that \u201cthe Russians are responsible for this strike whether they conducted it or not, because they took responsibility for the conduct of the Syrians by associating themselves with the Syrian regime.\u201d Read more US airstrikes on Syrian troops were \u2018intentional,\u2019 lasted nearly 1 hour \u2013 Assad to AP \\nThe latest proposal by Secretary of State John Kerry involves grounding only Syrian and Russian airplanes, Carter told Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-New Hampshire). \\n\u201cThere can be no question of grounding US aircraft\u201d over Syria, he said, adding that US jets conduct their strikes \u201cwith exceptional precision\u2026 that no other country can match.\u201d \\nSen. Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) asked about what it would take for the US to impose a no-fly zone over Syria, using the phrase \u201ccontrol the airspace.\u201d \\n\u201cRight now\u2026 for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia,\u201d Dunford replied, drawing a rebuke from committee chairman John McCain (R-Arizona), who argued a no-fly zone was possible without war. \\nAsked about the video of US-backed Syrian rebels insulting US Special Forces in Al-Rai and running them out of the northern Syrian town, Carter and Dunford shrugged it off. \\nREAD MORE: \u2018Crusaders!

He said the incident was \u201cirrelevant\u201d because the US-backed forces and Turkey were making \u201cgreat progress\u201d along Syria\u2019s northern border. \u2014 RT America (@RT_America) September 21, 2016 \\nIn their exchange with Graham, Carter and Dunford confirmed there is a plan to arm the Kurdish militia in Syria, over Turkish objections, as a way of advancing on the IS stronghold of Raqqa. Once Raqqa is taken, however, an Arab force would be required to hold it. \u201cWe have a plan,\u201d Dunford said, but described it as \u201cnot resourced.\u201d \\nDunford agreed with Graham\u2019s assertion that the US had two objectives \u2013 to destroy IS and to \u201cremove Assad,\u201d referring to the Syrian president \u2013 but admitted the Kurds were not interested in the latter. \\n\u201cIf the main fighting force inside of Syria is not signed up to take Assad out, where does that force come from?\u201d Graham asked. Neither Dunford nor Carter had an answer to that. \\nBoth the Pentagon heads and the lawmakers agreed throughout the hearing that caps on military spending mandated by sequestration were harmful and needed to be repealed. Lack of funding posed a significant threat to readiness and maintenance, Carter and Dunford argued, before pointing out that the US military was still the strongest, most powerful and most competent in the world.
