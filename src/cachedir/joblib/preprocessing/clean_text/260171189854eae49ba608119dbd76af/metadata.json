Goodson Jr. the driver of the police van in which Freddie Gray suffered the spinal cord injury that killed him, the prosecutor uttered two crucial words: \u201cRough ride. \u201d Officer Goodson, the prosecutor said, intended to \u201cbounce\u201d Mr. Gray, a black man, around in the van that morning. Officer Goodson, who is also black, is facing the toughest charge  \u2014     \u201cdepraved heart\u201d murder  \u2014   of the six officers accused in Mr. Gray\u2019s death. And legal experts say the prosecution\u2019s chances of a conviction on that count hinge in large part on being able to prove that Officer Goodson intentionally, and with disregard for Mr. Gray\u2019s life, drove him dangerously. The defense rested its case Friday, and closing arguments are set for Monday. But just before the state rested its case earlier this week, a crucial prosecution witness said he could not say whether a rough ride had occurred  \u2014   another indication of just how difficult the prosecution\u2019s case may be. It has different names around the country, including \u201cscreen test\u201d and \u201cnickel ride. \u201d Since it is a colloquial term, not a legal one, the precise definition can vary. But, legal and policing experts say, there is an element of intent. \u201cA rough ride is basically the police driving in such a manner to inflict injury or pain on the person being transported,\u201d said A. Dwight Pettit, a lawyer in Baltimore, who has represented dozens of plaintiffs in police brutality cases, \u201cbecause they have knowledge that the person is not secure in the vehicle and is usually handcuffed or possibly leg chained and therefore has no way to protect themselves. \u201d Geoffrey P. Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, said the tactic was known anecdotally as a form of punishment for unruly prisoners. \u201cNormally,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s just kind of, they end up with a few bruises or, worst case, it\u2019s a broken arm. \u201d On Wednesday, Stanford Franklin, a retired Baltimore police officer who was the prosecution\u2019s key policing witness, listed some possible elements of a rough ride during  : \u201cSudden acceleration, sudden stops, quick turns. \u201d It is difficult to assess the frequency of the practice, but cities including Chicago, Philadelphia and Aurora, Ill. have settled lawsuits  related to accusations of rough rides. In Baltimore, Tessa   president of the local branch of the N. A. A. C. P. and Mr. Pettit said they had both received complaints about rough rides, although they were not always substantiated in court. Those complaints have dropped off somewhat since Mr. Gray\u2019s story took over the headlines, increasing scrutiny of the police and raising calls for working cameras inside police wagons. Charles J. Key, a retired Baltimore police lieutenant, said that he \u201cnever saw a single instance\u201d of a rough ride in 26 years of his career there, beginning in 1970. But in 1997, a black man named Jeffery Alston was paralyzed during a ride in a Baltimore police van. In 2004, he received a $6 million settlement from the city. In 2005, another black man, Dondi Johnson Sr. died after suffering a spinal fracture during a police ride. A jury awarded his family more than $7 million, but the award was later reduced to $219, 000. Mr. Key testified as an expert witness in both cases. Officer Goodson faces seven charges, including   \u201cdepraved heart\u201d murder  \u2014   meaning murder born of willful disregard for human life  \u2014   and three counts of manslaughter. Prosecutors allege that Officer Goodson failed to buckle Mr. Gray\u2019s seatbelt or call for medical attention, which they say could have saved his life to them, those omissions were tantamount to a crime. And they allege Officer Goodson rolled through a stop sign and took a sharp right turn so fast that the van could not stay in its lane. \u201cHe was injured because he got a rough ride,\u201d Michael Schatzow, a prosecutor, said during opening statements, adding, \u201cThere was no good reason for the officer to repeatedly fail to seatbelt Mr. Gray except to bounce him around. \u201d Legal experts said it could be difficult for the prosecution to secure a murder conviction against Officer Goodson without proving that a rough ride had occurred. \u201cThe rough ride is important,\u201d said David Jaros, an associate professor of law at the University of Baltimore, \u201cbecause it tells us something about the driver\u2019s mental state and his willingness to risk human life. \u201d The state has presented evidence of Mr. Gray\u2019s devastating injuries. And with a detective, Michael Boyd, on the stand, prosecutors presented a series of surveillance videos showing the van making its way through Baltimore. But on Tuesday, during   Matthew Fraling, one of Officer Goodson\u2019s lawyers, asked Detective Boyd if he had observed the van at any point \u201cmake an abrupt start, an abrupt stop, or an abrupt turn. \u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Detective Boyd answered. On Wednesday, Mr. Franklin, the prosecution witness, testified that leg shackles made it hard for passengers to brace themselves in a van, and that, without a seatbelt, \u201cyour ability to limit yourself from being a projectile in that van is very limited. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important,\u201d Mr. Franklin added, \u201cthat that ride be as smooth as possible to prevent the person in the back from being tossed to and fro. \u201d Mr. Gray\u2019s legs were shackled during most of the ride and he was not wearing a seatbelt, but prosecutors did not draw direct connections between those facts and Mr. Franklin\u2019s testimony  \u2014   a point that Officer Goodson\u2019s lawyers sought to emphasize. \u201cIs it not your contention today that Officer Goodson in any way engaged in a rough ride?\u201d Mr. Fraling said. Mr. Franklin paused. \u201cI can\u2019t say. \u201d On Wednesday, Officer Goodson\u2019s lawyers moved to have the charges dismissed. While it is a common move by defendants, the lawyers focused on the rough ride during their oral arguments on Thursday. \u201cThere was no evidence introduced by the state to support a theory that Officer Goodson gave Mr. Gray a rough ride,\u201d said Andrew Graham, another lawyer for the officer, calling it a \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the state\u2019s argument. When the judge, Barry G. Williams, asked Mr. Schatzow to elaborate on how the prosecution had supported its case, including the murder charge, the prosecutor turned not to the rough ride, but to what they said was Officer Goodson\u2019s failure to buckle Mr. Gray\u2019s seatbelt on five different occasions, suggesting a possible pivot in the state\u2019s strategy. \u201cFive times is enough to demonstrate depraved heart,\u201d Mr. Schatzow said. Later, Judge Williams asked Mr. Schatzow if the state was acknowledging that it had not presented evidence of a rough ride. \u201cThe No. 1 piece of evidence is the fact that the man suffered a broken neck, and it killed him,\u201d said Mr. Schatzow, adding that that injury, combined with the \u201climited\u201d video evidence and that Mr. Gray was shackled, handcuffed and not wearing a seatbelt, made it possible to infer that a rough ride had occurred. But, he added, a rough ride was not a necessary element of the charges. \u201cThere are lots of ways to cause people to move about the compartment\u201d in the van, he said. Judge Williams allowed the case to continue with all the charges intact, but said it was a \u201ccloser call\u201d to let the murder charge move forward. Mr. Jaros, the law professor, said that the rough ride theory had \u201cflatlined,\u201d but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have a case at least for manslaughter based on his failure to buckle and then his refusal to get medical attention. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no question,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Jaros said, that \u201cyou\u2019ve got really a horrific level of callousness to the experience of the people who are being shuttled through the system. \u201d \u201cThe problem is, that doesn\u2019t necessarily satisfy a criminal charge. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564134.0357735}
