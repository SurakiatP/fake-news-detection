Trump has the mental fitness to be president of the United States? His answer in an interview on Monday was not very convincing. \u201cYeah, and my answer would be, sure,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said, after a sigh and a pause, in an interview for the first episode of \u201cThe \u201d a new politics podcast from The New York Times that was published on Tuesday. The former speaker declined to give a more emphatic endorsement of Mr. Trump\u2019s psychological sturdiness when the interviewer, Michael Barbaro, asked if he could \u201cbe more forceful than \u2018sure.\u2019 \u201d Instead, Mr. Gingrich said he believed Mr. Trump was \u201cat least as reliable as Andrew Jackson\u201d and praised him for possessing \u201ca personality which will by definition not be normal. \u201d Here is a transcript of the exchange: (Andrew Jackson was last in the news when the Treasury Department decided in April that the former president, a slaveholder known today for both his persecution of Native Americans and advocacy for poor whites, would share the $20 bill with the former slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman.) Questions have mounted among both Democrats and Republicans about whether Mr. Trump possesses the mental fitness and strength of character to serve as president, and his poll numbers have fallen as a result. Mr. Gingrich acknowledged Mr. Trump\u2019s trouble in his interview with \u201cThe  . \u201d \u201cThe last two weeks have been peculiarly bad for Trump,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump has appeared to inflict much of that damage upon himself, including by engaging in a   feud with the parents of a fallen United States soldier who criticized him at the Democratic National Convention, confounding many of his supporters. As his numbers have fallen and his troubles have grown, some Republican officials have begun to publicly reject his candidacy. On Monday Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she would not vote for Mr. Trump, citing his \u201cconstant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize\u201d to those he has attacked. Earlier that day, 50 national security officials who served in Republican administrations signed an open letter warning that he \u201cwould put at risk our country\u2019s national security and  \u201d if he won the election.'"}, "time": 1742562311.2253995}
