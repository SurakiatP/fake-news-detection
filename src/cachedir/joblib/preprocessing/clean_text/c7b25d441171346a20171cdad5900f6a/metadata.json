[\u201cThe recent test was in line with our plans and we will not allow foreigners to interfere in our defense affairs. The test did not violate the nuclear deal or (U. N.) Resolution 2231,\u201d Dehghan told the Tasnim news agency, as quoted by Reuters.  Dehghan is most likely correct about the nuclear deal, which gave Iran tremendous latitude and major economic incentives, while requiring few concessions from Tehran. He is on shakier ground regarding U. N. resolutions, but the U. N. Security Council has decided to form a committee to study Iranian missile testing, rather than issue an immediate condemnation. As Reuters notes, \u201ccritics\u201d of the relevant U. N. resolution (meaning primarily Iran and Russia) claim it merely discourages Iran from developing   ballistic missiles, rather than outright forbidding tests. The Iranian parliament issued a statement declaring that Iran is \u201cagainst weapons of mass destruction, so its missile capability is the only available deterrence against enemy hostility. \u201d They dismissed international condemnation of Iranian missile testing as \u201cillogical. \u201d The Trump administration condemned the missile launch in strong terms. \u201cI will tell the people across the world that is something you should be alarmed about,\u201d said Nikki Haley, the new ambassador to the United Nations. \u201cThe United States is not naive. We are not going to stand by. You will see us call them out, as we said we would, and you are also going to see us act accordingly. \u201d \u201cWe are officially putting Iran on notice,\u201d National Security Adviser Mike Flynn declared at a White House press briefing on Wednesday, citing both Iran\u2019s ballistic missile launch and the recent attack on a Saudi frigate by   insurgents in Yemen. Flynn said Iran had been \u201cemboldened\u201d to pursue such provocative behavior by the \u201cweak and ineffective\u201d response of the Obama administration.

N. resolutions. Taleblu observed that even without nuclear warheads, Iran\u2019s focus on missiles allows it to maintain a \u201cconventionally weak and asymmetrically strong\u201d military. In other words, Iran uses insurgents and terrorists to destabilize its enemies across the region, and if any of those enemies decides to counterattack Iran, it will find the border lined with enough missiles to make retaliatory actions too costly to contemplate.'"}, "time": 1742563538.2355776}
