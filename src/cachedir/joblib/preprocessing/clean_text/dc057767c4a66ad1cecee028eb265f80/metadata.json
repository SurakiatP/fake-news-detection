He was 87. His death was confirmed by his publisher, Farrar, Straus and Giroux. No cause was given, but he had been in poor health for some time, the publisher said. Mr. Walcott\u2019s expansive universe revolved around a tiny sun, the island of St. Lucia. Its opulent vegetation, blinding white beaches and tangled multicultural heritage inspired, in its most famous literary son, an ambitious body of work that seemingly embraced every poetic form, from the short lyric to the epic. With the publication of the collection \u201cIn a Green Night\u201d in 1962, critics and poets, Robert Lowell among them, leapt to recognize a powerful new voice in Caribbean literature and to praise the sheer musicality of Mr. Walcott\u2019s verse, the immediacy of its visual images, its profound sense of place. He had first attracted attention on St. Lucia with a book of poems that he published himself as a teenager. Early on, he showed a remarkable ear for the music of English  \u2014   heard in the poets whose work he absorbed in his Anglocentric education and on the lips of his fellow St. Lucians  \u2014   and a painter\u2019s eye for the particulars of the local landscape: its beaches and clouds its turtles, crabs and tropical fish the sparkling expanse of the Caribbean. In the poem \u201cIslands,\u201d from the collection \u201cIn a Green Night,\u201d he wrote: He told The Economist in 1990: \u201cThe sea is always present. It\u2019s always visible. All the roads lead to it. I consider the sound of the sea to be part of my body. And if you say in patois, \u2018The boats are coming back,\u2019 the beat of that line, its metrical space, has to do with the sound and rhythm of the sea itself. \u201d There was nothing shy about Mr. Walcott\u2019s poetic voice. It demanded to be heard, in all its sensuous immediacy and historical complexity. \u201cI come from a place that likes grandeur it likes large gestures it is not inhibited by flourish it is a rhetorical society it is a society of physical performance it is a society of style,\u201d he told The Paris Review in 1985. \u201cI grew up in a place in which if you learned poetry, you shouted it out. Boys would scream it out and perform it and do it and flourish it. If you wanted to approximate that thunder or that power of speech, it couldn\u2019t be done by a little modest voice in which you muttered something to someone else. \u201d Mr. Walcott\u2019s art developed and expanded in works like \u201cThe Castaway,\u201d \u201cThe Gulf\u201d and \u201cAnother Life,\u201d a   inquiry into his life and surroundings, published in 1973. The Caribbean poet George Lamming called it \u201cthe history of an imagination. \u201d Mr. Walcott quickly won recognition as one of the finest poets writing in English and as an enormously ambitious artist  \u2014   ambitious for himself, his art and his people. He had a sense of the Caribbean\u2019s grandeur that inspired him to write \u201cOmeros,\u201d a transposed Homeric epic of more than 300 pages, published in 1990, with humble fishermen and a taxi driver standing in for the heroes of ancient Greece. Two years later, he was awarded the Nobel Prize. The prize committee cited him for \u201ca poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment. \u201d It continued: \u201cIn his literary works Walcott has laid a course for his own cultural environment, but through them he speaks to each and every one of us. In him, West Indian culture has found its great poet. \u201d As a poet, Mr. Walcott plumbed the paradoxes of identity intrinsic to his situation. He was a   poet living on a   island whose people spoke   Creole or English. In \u201cA Far Cry From Africa,\u201d included in \u201cIn a Green Night\u201d  \u2014   his first poetry collection to be published outside St. Lucia  \u2014   he wrote: Derek Alton Walcott was born on Jan. 23, 1930, in Castries, a port city on the island of St. Lucia. His father, Warwick, a schoolteacher and watercolorist, died when he was an infant, and he was raised by his schoolteacher mother, the former Alix Maarlin. Both his parents, like many St. Lucians, were the products of racially mixed marriages. Derek was raised as a Methodist, which made him an exception on St. Lucia, a largely Roman Catholic island, and at his Catholic secondary school, St. Mary\u2019s College. His education was Anglocentric and thoroughly traditional. \u201cI was taught English literature as my natural inheritance,\u201d he wrote in the essay \u201cThe Muse of History. \u201d \u201cForget the snow and daffodils. They were real, more real than the heat and oleander, perhaps, because they lived on the page, in imagination, and therefore in memory. \u201d He published his first poem at 14, in a local newspaper. With a loan from his mother, he began publishing his poetry in pamphlets while still at St. Mary\u2019s. His early models were Marlowe and Milton. At the University of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica, where he majored in French, Latin and Spanish, he began writing plays, entering into a lifelong but rocky love affair with the theater. His first play, about the revolutionary Haitian leader Henri Christophe, was produced in St. Lucia in 1950. After earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1953, Mr. Walcott taught school in St. Lucia, Grenada and Jamaica while continuing to write and stage plays. His verse dramas \u201cIone\u201d and \u201cSea at Dauphin\u201d were produced in Trinidad in 1954. \u201c  and His Brothers,\u201d a retelling of a Trinidadian folk tale in which Lucifer tries to steal the souls of three brothers, was produced in Trinidad in 1958. Mr. Walcott studied directing with Jos\u00e9 Quintero in New York for a year and, on returning to the West Indies, founded a repertory company, the Little Carib Theater Workshop, which in the late 1960s became the Trinidad Theater Workshop. One of the group\u2019s first productions was Mr. Walcott\u2019s \u201cMalcochon. \u201d His   play was \u201cDream on Monkey Mountain,\u201d which received an Off Broadway production in 1971. He later wrote the book and collaborated with the singer and songwriter Paul Simon on the lyrics for \u201cThe Capeman,\u201d a musical about a Puerto Rican gang member who murdered three people in Manhattan in 1959. The show opened at the Marquis Theater in 1998 and closed after 68 performances, becoming one of the most expensive flops in Broadway history. With the publication of \u201cIn a Green Night\u201d in 1962, Mr. Walcott captured the attention of British and American critics. Robert Lowell in particular was enthusiastic, and served as a point of entry to the American literary world. With each succeeding collection  \u2014   \u201cSelected Poems\u201d (1964) \u201cThe Castaway\u201d (1969) \u201cThe Gulf\u201d (1970) and \u201cSea Grapes\u201d (1976)  \u2014   Mr. Walcott established himself as something more than an interesting local poet. \u201cAficionados of Caribbean writing have been aware for some time that Derek Walcott is the first considerable   poet to emerge from the   Arcadia of the old slaveocracies,\u201d the poet and critic Selden Rodman wrote in a review of \u201cThe Gulf\u201d in The New York Times Book Review. \u201cNow, with the publication of his fourth book of verse, Walcott\u2019s stature in the front rank of all contemporary poets using English should be apparent. \u201d The lyric strain in Mr. Walcott\u2019s poetry never disappeared, but he increasingly took on complex narrative projects and expanded his vision of the Caribbean to accommodate an epic treatment of the themes that had always engaged him. The artistic   of \u201cAnother Life,\u201d with its rich,   intertwining of the artist\u2019s developing sensibility and the lush landscape of St. Lucia, set the bar for Mr. Walcott\u2019s later, increasingly ambitious poetry. In \u201cOmeros\u201d  \u2014   the title is the modern Greek word for Homer  \u2014   Mr. Walcott cast his net wide, embracing all of Caribbean history from time immemorial, with special attention to the slave trade, and refracting its story through Homeric legend. In his hands, the Caribbean became not a backwater but a crossroads  \u2014   what the scholar Jorge Hernandez Martin, writing in the magazine Americas in 1994, called \u201ca dispersion zone, a sort of switchboard with input from and output to other parts of the world. \u201d Travel and exile were constants in Mr. Walcott\u2019s poetry. \u201cTiepolo\u2019s Hound\u201d (2000) presented a dual portrait of the author and the Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro, who spent his childhood in the Caribbean before being transplanted to Paris. Like his father, Mr. Walcott was an accomplished watercolorist his landscape paintings appear on his book jackets, and in \u201cTiepolo\u2019s Hound\u201d they are interspersed through the book. The wanderings in \u201cOmeros\u201d were rivaled by Mr. Walcott\u2019s own zigzag itinerary as a teacher and lecturer at universities around the world. He taught at Boston University from 1981 until retiring in 2007, dividing his time among Boston, New York and St. Lucia but constantly en route. \u201cThe Prodigal\u201d (2004) a   summation with a distinctly elegiac undercurrent, offered a glimpse of the author\u2019s restless movements, which take him, in the course of the poem, to Italy, Colombia, France and Mexico. \u201cProdigal, what were your wanderings about?\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe smoke of homecoming, the smoke of departure. \u201d Mr. Walcott\u2019s three marriages ended in divorce. His survivors include his longtime companion, Sigrid Nama a son, Peter two daughters, Anna   and Elizabeth   and several grandchildren. His twin brother, Roderick, a playwright, died in 2000. In 2009, Mr. Walcott was proposed for the honorary post of professor of poetry at Oxford University. His candidacy was derailed when academics at Oxford received an anonymous package containing photocopied pages of a book describing allegations of sexual harassment brought by a Harvard student decades earlier. Mr. Walcott withdrew his name. \u201cI am disappointed that such low tactics have been used in this election, and I do not want to get into a race for a post where it causes embarrassment to those who have chosen to support me for the role or to myself,\u201d he told The Evening Standard of London. He added, \u201cWhile I was happy to be put forward for the post, if it has degenerated into a low and degrading attempt at character assassination, I do not want to be part of it. \u201d Mr. Walcott was always conscious of writing as a man apart, from a corner of the world whose literature was in its infancy. This peculiar position, he argued, had its advantages. \u201cThere can be virtues in deprivation,\u201d he said in his Nobel lecture, describing the \u201cluck\u201d of being present in the early morning of a culture. \u201cFor every poet, it is always morning in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory a forgotten, insomniac night History and elemental awe are always our early beginning, because the fate of poetry is to fall in love with the world, in spite of History. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563514.1281602}
