In an unusual statement, the prince, the    grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, said that a line had been crossed in the reporting of his relationship with Ms. Markle, 35, whose mother is black and whose father is white. \u201cSome of this has been very public,\u201d read the statement, issued in the name of the prince\u2019s spokesman, Jason Knauf. \u201cThe smear on the front page of a national newspaper the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. \u201d The role and behavior of the news media are a particularly sensitive topic for Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William. Their mother, Diana, died in Paris in a 1997 car crash when pursued by paparazzi. Both princes, who were then 12 and 15, have said that their mother\u2019s death made them wary of the news media, though the royal family has generally been skillful in getting favorable coverage and suppressing scandal. But internet competition and social media activity have accelerated and coarsened coverage of the prince\u2019s relationship with a divorced, biracial woman who was already in the public eye as an actress. Since articles surfaced about Ms. Markle\u2019s dating Prince Harry, the British tabloids have expressed surprise that a \u201cbrunette\u201d would be his type and accused her of not being British enough for him. The Daily Mail ran an article headlined, \u201cHarry\u2019s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton:   home of her mother revealed  \u2014   so will he be dropping by for tea?\u201d The article then wove together various racial stereotypes, lamenting Ms. Markle\u2019s mother\u2019s \u201c \u201d Los Angeles neighborhood, Crenshaw, and its \u201ctatty   homes,\u201d and listing crime statistics for the area. Newspapers have been digging up suggestive photographs of Ms. Markle and examining her past relationships, and some comments on their websites and on social media have been explicit and racist. The prince\u2019s statement, which confirmed his   relationship with Ms. Markle, expressed fears for her safety and privacy. It noted that his office had regularly fought to keep defamatory articles out of the newspapers  \u2014   which he said had offered large bribes to her  . The statement also condemned the way that the news media has invaded Ms. Markle\u2019s privacy and harassed her mother. In one instance, a palace official said a photographer had chased an assistant to Ms. Markle through the garage of her home in Toronto. The photographer had to be physically removed and the police called, the official said. One article in the tabloid The Sun was about Ms. Markle\u2019s appearing on Pornhub, an adult website, even though the \u201csteamy scenes,\u201d as the newspaper called them, were not pornography but taken from a television series she acts in, \u201cSuits. \u201d The Sun also ran a headline above an interview with Ms. Markle\u2019s estranged sister, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t fall for my little sis, Harry, she\u2019d be the next Princess Pushy,\u201d a reference to the unkind nickname for Princess Michael of Kent. One comment piece in last weekend\u2019s Mail on Sunday, by Rachel Johnson, said of Ms. Markle: \u201cGenetically, she is blessed. If there is issue from her alleged union with Prince Harry, the Windsors will thicken their watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNA. \u201d Ms. Markle described herself as biracial in an August 2015 interview with Elle magazine, saying, \u201cMy dad is Caucasian and my mom is  . I\u2019m half black and half white. \u201d The essay also discussed some of the racism she has experienced as a result. Afua Hirsch, writing in The Guardian, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle point, easily missed. Meghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s apparent new love, is a \u2018glamorous brunette,\u2019 \u2018a departure from Prince Harry\u2019s usual type\u2019 and \u2018not in the society blonde style of previous girlfriends,\u2019 according to The Daily Mail. I think what they are trying to say is that Markle, actor, global development ambassador and lifestyle blogger, is black. \u201d Even more scandalous to the tabloids, wrote Ms. Hirsch, is that Ms. Markle is older and divorced and played somewhat \u201craunchy scenes\u201d in \u201cSuits\u201d and that \u201cher mother is visibly black, with dreadlocks. \u201d Ms. Markle, who graduated from Northwestern University in 2003, married in 2011 and divorced two years later, a fact that has also been the source of attention from the news media. Prince Harry has criticized the news media before, but never in such an angry and formal fashion. He has gotten into public trouble in the past, with leaked photographs of parties in Las Vegas or wearing a Nazi costume. \u201cPrince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle\u2019s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. \u201d \u201cHe knows commentators will say this is \u2018the price she has to pay\u2019 and that \u2018this is all part of the game,\u2019\u201d the statement continued. \u201cHe strongly disagrees. This is not a game  \u2014   it is her life and his. \u201d Ms. Markle is best known for her role as Rachel Zane on the television legal drama \u201cSuits,\u201d and she played an F. B. I. agent in the   series \u201cFringe. \u201d She has also been involved in charitable work with nongovernmental organizations. Ms. Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada this year, traveling to Rwanda for its clean water campaign, and she has worked for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment.'"}, "time": 1742564195.18024}
