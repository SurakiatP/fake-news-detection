In 2000, when they were not yet 25 years old, they founded SPLAT, a company that today supplies personal care and household chemical products to 45 countries around the world. \\n\u201cIn the beginning, the company specialized in the production of biologically active additives and cosmetics based on Spirulina platensis seaweed \u2014 thus the company name,\u201d explains Evgeny Demin. \\nThey quickly decided to target their efforts in another direction: on the production of next-generation toothpaste. \\n\u201cFrom the very start, we agreed to create the best toothpaste in the world, so that it would surpass all expectations,\u201d he said. \\nEvgeny Demin and Elena Demina / Source: Press photo \\nThe couple first rented a factory for their operations near Moscow and in 2009 they opened their own plant 300 miles northwest of the Russian capital in the Novgorod Region. Today it employs more than 350 people. A total of 700 people work for the company, including in sales and marketing offices abroad. \\nThe company has opened a subsidiary and hired a local team in China and is now looking forward to working with its Chinese partners, according to SPLAT\u2019s press service. The company\u2019s premium products are particularly popular in Germany and SPLAT has also started to sell its products in France. The company currently owns more than 10 Russian and foreign patents. The right segment \\nFrom the very beginning SPLAT toothpaste was priced about twice that of its supermarket rivals. Entering the premium segment, where there were practically no competitors, was one of the factors of the brand\u2019s success, says Alexander Yeremenko, managing director of the BrandLab marketing agency. \\nAccording to Yeremenko when SPLAT debuted, two major international players, Procter&Gamble and Colgate, had claimed the middle segment of the Russian market, while the lower end was dominated by Russian producers selling very cheap toothpaste. \\n\u201cIn the high-price segment, besides LACALUT, there were no important players,\u201d Yeremenko said. \\nSource: Press photo \\nSome of SPLAT\u2019s exclusive offerings include black toothpaste made from Karelian coal and golden toothpaste featuring extracts of diamond and colloidal gold. SPLAT\u2019s scientific laboratory and R&D center in Moscow are in charge of developing the toothpaste\u2019s unique components. \\nIn 2008 the company began exporting its products and by 2015 foreign sales made up 17 percent of its revenue. One of its most successful foreign markets is Turkey, where SPLAT was able to sign an exclusive contract with one of the country\u2019s leading perfume and cosmetics chains. \\nThe company has opened a subsidiary and hired a local team in China and is now looking forward to working with its Chinese partners, according to SPLAT\u2019s press service. The company\u2019s premium products are particularly popular in Germany and SPLAT has also started to sell its products in France. The company currently owns more than 10 Russian and foreign patents. A personal approach to customer loyalty \\nThe company has not divulged any financial indicators, but in value terms SPLAT holds 9.7 percent of the Russian market and in terms of sales it has a 14.7-percent market share, says Timur Nigmatullin, an analyst at Finam Holding. \\nNigmatullin attributes SPLAT\u2019s success in part to its unusual marketing strategy. The company does not employ TV advertising on principle and focuses its energies on repeat sales to loyal customers. \\nYeremenko believes that SPLAT\u2019s marketing efforts were appropriate for a product in the high-end segment of the market where consumers value innovation and are ready to pay for it. \\n\u201cSPLAT did not have money for promotion, which is why all efforts were directed at achieving a high-quality and innovative product,\u201d Yeremenko said, adding that the firm\u2019s unique offerings, such as being the first black toothpaste or having unusual taste and components are all elements of marketing, which requires constant research and experimentation. \\nThe company also takes a personal approach to encouraging brand loyalty. Each SPLAT toothpaste package contains a letter from Evgeny Demin himself, the firm\u2019s general director. At the end of each letter, he provides his personal email address noting that he responds to all messages himself. \\n\u201cThe director\u2019s letters in the packages create the impression of the producer\u2019s responsibility to the customer; [they] guarantee a quality approach and the company\u2019s excellent result on the market,\u201d Yeremenko said. Not just toothpaste \\nToday SPLAT has diversified and it produces more than 200 different products from its 50,000 sq. ft. plant in the Novgorod Region. The company\u2019s offerings include toothpastes, brushes, foams and mouthwashes, the BioMio ecological line of housekeeping products, the organic LALLUM Baby line of natural cosmetics for children and mothers and the HEYA series of natural shampoos and conditioners. \\nSource: Press photo \\nHEYA is one of SPLAT\u2019s latest developments and is one of co-founder Elena Demina\u2019s proudest accomplishments. \\n\u201cThe idea of creating products for health and hair beauty that would be just as unique and effective as all the other SPLAT products, came to us a long time ago,\u201d she said. \u201cOur team spent more than five years working on it.\u201d \\nThe market for hair care products is highly competitive, but SPLAT\u2019s offerings, made exclusively from natural ingredients without silicon or parabens, are unique. The company took its time developing the HEYA series components, but Demina says she is very happy with the result. \\n\u201cWe do not compete with other hair care producers because, all modesty aside, we believe that our products are unique and unrepeatable,\u201d she said. \\nSource: Press photo \\nNigmatullin considers the Russian market robust and large enough to accommodate new products, despite the unfavorable economic situation and the difficult investment climate. \\n\u201cThe SPLAT phenomenon is not the only one,\u201d Nigmatullin said. \u201cThere are many other examples: UAZ, Ural motorcycles, a long list of medicine produced in local plants, confectionery and so on.\u201d \\nAccording to Yeremenko SPLAT\u2019s success can be attributed to hard work and planning. \\n\u201cActually, SPLAT\u2019s story is not as magical as it seems,\u201d Yeremenko said. \u201cIt is proof of a solid marketing approach, which basically any producer can adopt.\u201d \\nIn his view, SPLAT\u2019s founders demonstrated sound judgment and perseverance in developing their idea. \\n\u201cThe problem with most Russian companies is not the lack of ideas, but that they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going,\u201d he said. \u201cBut SPLAT had a strategy and most importantly, it patiently implemented it.\u201d Subscribe to get the hand picked best stories every week Related '"}, "time": 1742563525.5451386}
