For the last two years, this rapper, now two decades into a career defined by prodigious output, has been enmeshed in a messy public contract dispute with Cash Money Records, his longtime label, and in a more personal clash with its boss and his onetime father figure, Baby, or Birdman. In addition to his 11th solo album, \u201cTha Carter V,\u201d the fate of his label imprint, Young Money, teeters in the balance, with Lil Wayne, 34, claiming in court that he was never properly compensated for his work or for helping to birth the careers of Drake and Nicki Minaj. In a string of emotional   tweets last month, Lil Wayne expressed his exhaustion with his career status and threatened to retire. \u201cI AM NOW DEFENSELESS AND mentally DEFEATED  I leave gracefully and thankful,\u201d he wrote. Adding to the anxiety surrounding his career, there have also been a series of health scares, including a spate of seizures in recent years. Yet Lil Wayne has proved vital in 2016, sounding renewed in a torrent of collaborations, including his work with 2 Chainz in the duo Collegrove, and in   appearances on songs by Chance the Rapper and Solange. On Tuesday, in lieu of new music, Lil Wayne released \u201cGone \u2019Til November,\u201d his   prison journals from the eight months in 2010 he spent behind bars at Rikers Island for gun possession. The slim book, printed on lined paper in an approximation of his handwriting, evokes the   monotony of jail, with flashes of humor (his   snack is a tortilla stuffed with Doritos) and darkness (an inmate with AIDS berates him for being \u201ca junkie\u201d). At a book signing at the Strand in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday, about 200 fans, diverse in age and appearance, lined up beginning at 3:30 a. m. for a few seconds with the   Lil Wayne, lavishing him with praise and tears as he sipped from his trademark double cup of lean (or syrup, the dangerous prescription cough syrup mixture). Later that afternoon, in a hotel suite, he was engaged and feisty as he discussed his struggle to remain optimistic and his inability to feign an interest in politics. After obtaining a soap dish in which to ash his collection of chubby blunts, his eyes widened with focus. \u201cShoot,\u201d he said. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. With this book, were you worried about revisiting a difficult time? I haven\u2019t read it, and I don\u2019t plan on reading it. I\u2019m not one of those people who revisit things. I don\u2019t remember [expletive]. I could meet the president and forget it. Of course I thought it was because I smoke too much. But somebody told me: \u201cThe reason why you don\u2019t remember things is that it\u2019s not the same for you as it is everybody else. Because you are it. \u201d You write in the introduction that the book is for fans to \u201chave something from me while they continue to be ever so amazing and patient. \u201d Plain and simple, because they\u2019re not getting anything from me, unfortunately. They\u2019re not getting a damn thing from Wayne other than a tweet here or there. You\u2019ve done plenty of guest verses. I do that all the time. I\u2019ve been doing features since they named them features. Two that stick out are the Chance song \u201cNo Problem\u201d and Solange\u2019s \u201cMad. \u201d Those are personal in a way that you haven\u2019t been in some time. Are you in a different   given the career turmoil? It\u2019s just the song. If you send me a song about football, then I\u2019m gonna go hard about football. It\u2019s also about the artist. Is there something about working with younger musicians who are pushing boundaries? I would say so. It\u2019s different. These people are turning the clock right now. They are the trendsetters of tomorrow, and I actually pay attention to what they send me. If [my manager] Tez sends me a song and says, \u2018I need you to do this verse for whoever,\u2019 I knock it out in that one night and send it right back. When I get the Solange or Chance song, I\u2019m actually riding in my car, banging that. When I put my verse on it, I\u2019m telling my engineer, \u201cLet me get a copy. \u201d The other ones, I\u2019m just sending back to Tez. Are there rappers in the new school that are motivating you? Are you keeping up with Yachty, Uzi Vert, 21 Savage, Kodak? I swear to God I didn\u2019t know you were saying people\u2019s names just now, so that should probably answer that question. I just do my own thing. After being in prison, someone like T. I. made fighting for criminal justice reform part of his life. You\u2019ve said Black Lives Matter was a wave that passed you by. Why haven\u2019t you been attracted to activism? I believe there\u2019s a bunch of different types of artists and musicians. To even notice what\u2019s going out there  \u2014   I\u2019m trying to make these words stop popping up in my head, I\u2019m trying to make them rhyme. I\u2019ve got all kind of color lives mattering up in here  \u2014   green, all kinds of stuff mattering. I\u2019m trying to make sense of what\u2019s on in this world up in here [points to head]. In prison, you got a letter from a pastor who asked you to rap about God. You consider your influence and say, \u201cI would have straight killers in the church every Sunday. \u201d But ultimately you decide that\u2019s not you.  Not at all. I was on a sports show recently, and I was asked a question like that about black lives or whatever. When we got off the air, [the host] Shannon Sharpe said: \u201cI really want to commend you for answering like that, because you didn\u2019t make something up just to make yourself one of us. And to make yourself a victim. \u201d I\u2019m not that. And honestly, I don\u2019t care. I care what\u2019s going on with me and my kids and my world and my mom and who\u2019s going to pay this next bill. That\u2019s what matters to me. In prison, you watched a lot of reality TV  \u2014   \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d \u201cCelebrity Apprentice. \u201d Do you have any words for Donald Trump? [Laughs] Who\u2019s that? Is \u201cTha Carter V\u201d an album that\u2019s finished, or is it constantly evolving as the months and years go by? It\u2019s done, sitting and wrapped as is. I just listened to it for the first time in months the other day. I had forgotten every single word on it, because I work every day. I popped it in, and I was like, it\u2019s still so much better than everything I\u2019ve ever heard. Not what\u2019s going on right now  \u2014   everything I\u2019ve ever heard. You\u2019ve always been a creature of the studio. When the music isn\u2019t coming out, are you still in there as much? Probably more. I\u2019m a positive thinker, so I\u2019m still looking forward to the day that it does come out. Plus, I am musician to the heart. I love to get better every day. Has your recording process changed in this stage of your career? Not at all. Put the beat on, I\u2019mma smoke one and bob my head and be ready in a few minutes. When other artists came out in support after your retirement tweets, did that make up for how low you were feeling? I\u2019d be a liar to say it didn\u2019t. People always say, \u201cHow could not expect it?\u201d But when I saw people giving a damn about what I\u2019m going through, that made me think and obviously uplifted me. Sometimes what you\u2019re going through takes you far away from what the reality is. It takes someone to remind you: Look this way and remember what\u2019s over here. I never have bad days I have bad moments. Do you see any light at the end of the tunnel with the label situation? I do. I don\u2019t have to even look. I\u2019m gonna make sure that there\u2019s light. If there\u2019s a wall at the end of the tunnel, I\u2019m gonna shoot that [expletive] down. And there\u2019s gonna be light behind that wall.'"}, "time": 1742628466.6114714}
