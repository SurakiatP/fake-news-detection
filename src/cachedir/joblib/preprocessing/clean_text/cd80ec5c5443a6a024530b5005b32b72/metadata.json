Kate Davis, 24, says the sunlight that bounces off museum walls and onto the art can\u2019t be reproduced. Stan Kaplan, 65, flies across the country just to see a Leonardo da Vinci drawing \u201cmore beautiful\u201d than the Mona Lisa. And an elderly woman posts to Facebook a selfie of herself beside a masterwork, presumably commencing an avalanche of   approval. These were observations collected during a summer at New York City\u2019s \u201cnewest\u201d museum, the Met Breuer, an outpost of the Metropolitan Museum of Art that opened in March in the former home of the Whitney Museum of American Art. There\u2019s not much theatrical about the scenes  \u2014   unlike, say, the one that featured two teenagers in San Francisco who placed eyeglasses on the floor of an art museum so they could watch tourists gather around their \u201cinstallation\u201d with fascination. But taken together, they are a gauge  \u2014   imperfect and impressionistic  \u2014   of what draws people to museums and what they see when they get there. They are reflections of the times, too, reminders that art is digested in ways it wasn\u2019t. Art rewards internalization, but distractions surround us. Cultural critique is instant, impulsive, and travels virally. We tried to find out what goes on in the mind of the modern museumgoer, unscientifically, by staking out the Met Breuer and interviewing nearly 50 art gazers over the course of two months, their pensive moments pierced by our questions as they peered at works. The setting was the Breuer\u2019s big inaugural exhibition \u201cUnfinished: Thoughts Left Visible,\u201d as provocative a springboard for opinions as any. It focuses on the notion of \u201cunfinished\u201d art and does so broadly, displaying works that were never finished, works that are intentionally incomplete (non finito) and art that prompts conceptual discussion about what is complete, like a Jackson Pollock drip painting. The   exhibition  \u2014   which ends its   run next weekend  \u2014   spans the 1400s to today and features artists as varied as Titian, Andy Warhol and a teenage Pablo Picasso. As for those interviewed, they included students who said museums were like \u201ceating your vegetables\u201d and romantics who cherish their lunch breaks, when they can hop in a cab to go steal a few quiet minutes in front of a beloved painting they have already gazed at dozens of times before. A handful of works in particular generated the most comment (a deathbed portrait of an artist\u2019s mistress, a painting of someone being skinned alive) and common themes emerged over time (the ubiquity of technology, people\u2019s short attention spans). Here\u2019s what museumgoers said. The artwork: \u201cJames Hunter Black Draftee\u201d (1965) by Alice Neel Mr. Anderson\u2019s take: \u201cHe probably did get killed because his family would have heard about this painting and said something by now. \u201d Another perspective: \u201cWhen I saw this image in the advertisements, I saw it as contemporary, like an album cover. \u201d  \u2014   Steve Wolkwitz, 25, a student The artwork: \u201c  With Wig\u201d ( ) by Pablo Picasso Ms. Kops\u2019 take: \u201cHe was probably drunk. \u201d Another perspective: \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a Picasso. And then like, whoa. It\u2019s a Picasso. \u201d  \u2014   Normandie Syken, 20, an illustrator  The artwork: \u201cUntitled   (Green Paintings)\u201d (circa 1986) by Cy Twombly Mr. Meyerhofer\u2019s take: \u201cI want to hate it, but it\u2019s so good. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s awful algae green. But you can\u2019t deny it. It grabs you. But part of me thinks it is so crude. \u201d The artwork: \u201cThe Flaying of Marsyas\u201d (probably 1570s) by Titian Mr. Meyerhofer\u2019s take: \u201cIt\u2019s so violent and awful. My husband would say, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want this on the wall of my living room.\u2019 This must have been the equivalent of a horror movie back in the day. \u201d Another perspective: \u201cYou\u2019re imagining what is he going to do with that knife. The bucket: Is it enough to hold? And his eyes  \u2014   he can see the pain coming. \u201d  \u2014   Stan Kaplan, 65, Los Angeles  The artwork: \u201cThe Vision of Saint John\u201d ( ) by El Greco Ms. Campbell\u2019s take: \u201cIt could have been a blue sky, but maybe it was going to be dark and stormy. \u201d Another perspective: \u201cIt\u2019s so modern. And what\u2019s with these crazy babies floating around?\u201d  \u2014   William Meyerhofer The artwork: \u201cHead of a Woman (La Scapigliata)\u201d ( ) by Leonardo da Vinci Mr. Miozzo\u2019s take: \u201cThis is unfinished, but you can see the psychology of a character. It forces you to think what is in the mind of this young woman. It makes me think, Who was she? What was she thinking?\u201d Another perspective: \u201cI think about how much more beautiful she is than the Mona Lisa. \u201d  \u2014   Stan Kaplan Another perspective: \u201cYou need to see this one with your own eyes. No reproduction I\u2019ve seen comes close to this. \u201d  \u2014   Martin R. Anderson The artwork: \u201cYou or Me\u201d (2005) by Maria Lassnig Ms. Choi\u2019s take: \u201cIt made me think about women in Korea, where I read that the suicide rate is [very high]. For some reason, I thought about that. \u201d Another perspective: \u201cThis is brave. She\u2019s old. She\u2019s overweight. Think about how courageous this is. \u201d  \u2014   Michele Miozzo The artwork: \u201cCart Full of Action\u201d (1986) by Cady Noland Ms. Davis\u2019 take: \u201cI don\u2019t like this. I think the question is not even if it is finished but is this even art? I could see this in a parking lot. \u201d Another perspective: \u201cThis is what the artist is putting into the world. Nothing is a waste of space. \u201d  \u2014   Tony White, 29, Louisville The artwork: \u201cGardanne\u201d ( ) by Paul C\u00e9zanne Michelle Oliveira\u2019s take: \u201cThe curious thing to me is why are these unfinished. What better thing did Picasso or C\u00e9zanne feel they needed to go and do? Grab a coffee? Go kiss a girl?\u201d Nilza Oliveira\u2019s take: \u201cAn artist is never finished so their art is never finished. When you finish it, you kill it. Leaving it unfinished, you keep it alive. \u201d The artwork: \u201cBouquet of Peonies in a Green Jar\u201d (1898) by Paul C\u00e9zanne Mr. Scotch\u2019s take: \u201cThose empty spaces could be light. If you put more there, it\u2019s almost too much information. Like this it is allowed to breathe. \u201d Another perspective: \u201cThere are only a few strokes here. But I can tell the petals feel velvet. \u201d  \u2014   Michele Miozzo The artwork: \u201cValentine   on her Deathbed\u201d by Ferdinand Hodler Mr. Breed\u2019s take: \u201cIt\u2019s not begging to be finished. \u201d Other perspectives: \u201cI\u2019ve seen a bunch of deathbed paintings. I didn\u2019t realize it was a woman until I saw the feet. \u201d  \u2014   Jeremy Cole, 24, designer, Toronto \u201cThere was something about coming out as a gay man in the \u201980s and seeing so many of my friends dying that reminds me of this. \u201d  \u2014   William Meyerhofer'"}, "time": 1742628497.8400052}
