Trump. \\nThat\u2019s right: The Donald \u2013 sexual predator, sociopath, disgraced businessman, reality TV star and all around huckster \u2013 is now the most powerful man in the world (insofar as any individual can wield power within extremely complex systems and institutions). \\nNevertheless, President Trump now presides over the largest military empire and the richest nation in the history of the world. \\n*** \\nI was wrong. Hell, almost everyone was wrong, except my Mom, whose street smarts outperformed Nate Silver\u2019s algorithms. Looking back, I should\u2019ve known better and trusted my instincts. After all, I live in Michigan City, Indiana, located in the heart of America\u2019s Rust Belt \u2013 the region that gave the world President Trump. \\nI grew up with Trump supporters. Many of my neighbors are Trump supporters. Most of my father\u2019s friends are Trump supporters. And half of my extended family voted for Trump. In many ways, I should be a Trump supporter: I\u2019m White, male, a high school graduate (never finished college) and a Marine Corps veteran. \\nThankfully, I found good books, good music and good drugs at 19 years old. Otherwise, who knows? I could\u2019ve ended up at a Trump rally, punching protesters and acting like a jackbooted thug. Instead, I find myself firmly planted on the left, wondering how we can reach out to portions of Trump\u2019s base. \\n*** \\nIn the age of social media, conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods often drown out rational debate and facts. FoxNews, AM Radio and the Alt-Right media have poisoned the well. In the process, they\u2019ve bamboozled large segments of White America \u2013 both young and old. \\nThanks to alternative news sources such as Breitbart and Alex Jones, tens of millions of Americans are being exposed to a quasi-Libertarian/Alt-Right ideology at a staggering pace. Breaking this web of propaganda will be an enormous task, but a necessary one. Here, existing alternative media outlets will be essential. \\nIf we\u2019re interested in exposing more working class and poor white Americans to leftwing ideas and radical politics, we\u2019ll need to write and speak in a way that regular people can understand. In the real world, no one gives a fuck how smart you sound. In fact, I would argue that\u2019s one of the reasons some of Trump\u2019s supporters resent the MSNBC-Yuppie-Liberal-types: they come off as smug assholes. \\n*** \\nSpeaking of smug assholes, we can thank Rachel Maddow, the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN for Trump\u2019s victory. The only thing more precious than their hubris and utter lack of journalistic integrity is their willingness to normalize a sexual predator and neofascist as president. If there\u2019s any silver lining to this election, it\u2019s that the liberal media has been exposed as the propaganda wing of the DNC. \\nNot only did they destroy Bernie\u2019s chances (if he ever had any to begin with), they then tried to shove a neoliberal-hawk down our throats. But people didn\u2019t buy it, especially black and brown people. \\n*** \\nAs we speak, tends of thousands of Americans are taking to the street to protest Trump and White Supremacy. While I wholeheartedly encourage and support those who are protesting, would Hillary have enjoyed such a reception from the left? Doubtful. \\nAnd where have the protests been for the last eight years of Obama\u2019s drone wars and capitulation to Wall Street? Where was the outrage as Obama deported more immigrants in his first four years than Bush deported in his entire eight? \\nYes, let\u2019s protest. But let\u2019s be more principled and sophisticated than we were during the Bush years. If 2020 or 2024 ends with another Obama, we\u2019ve failed. In order for this not to happen, we\u2019ll need to constantly reexamine what we\u2019re doing, and why. \\n*** \\nAnd this brings us to Veterans Day, one of the most hollow and absurd holidays in American society. Unless you have stock in Lockheed Martin or Goldman Sachs, there\u2019s really no reason to thank me for my \u201cservice.\u201d We destroyed Iraq and killed innocent people. We mutilated dead bodies and tortured prisoners. And we did it all for geopolitical and corporate interests. \\nSome studies suggest over 1,000,000 Iraqis have died as a result of America\u2019s illegal and immoral war. The war in Iraq has also given the world ISIS. The war in Iraq destabilized an entire region of the planet (something conveniently forgotten by most Americans as they contemplate No Fly Zones in Syria). The war in Iraq has resulted in thousands of veterans suicides (22 a day). More marines from my platoon have killed themselves since returning home than died overseas. \\nBut vets get to go home, at least most of them. The Iraqis have to live with the legacy of Uncle Sam\u2019s madness for the rest of their lives. Everyone had better think about what all of this means as President-Elect Donald J. Trump, a man who openly mocked a Purple Heart recipient and joked about using nuclear weapons, takes office. Related '"}, "time": 1742562094.621323}
