And that one of his life goals at the time was to seek out the schoolyard bully and envelop him in a warm embrace. \u201cHe was a brilliant terror, kind of like a \u201d Mr. Garfield recalled during an interview one warm night in the fall. \u201cMy first impulse was to give him a hug and a kiss and tell him he was all right, and that he didn\u2019t have to behave that way. \u201d He paused, a few moments later adding, \u201cOf course, I became his main target, because I saw him so deeply. \u201d After a few hours of conversation with Mr. Garfield about, among other things, celebrity toxicity, spiritual steadfastness, authentic living and God, it was evident that Mr. Garfield sees many things deeply. This attribute was integral to his landing starring roles in two meaty movies that are receiving awards attention this season. The first is Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d about Desmond T. Doss, a   World War II hero, a   Adventist and conscientious objector who refused to carry weaponry the part has landed Mr. Garfield his second Golden Globe nomination. The other is Martin Scorsese\u2019s   \u201cSilence,\u201d in which Mr. Garfield plays a   Jesuit priest, Sebastien Rodrigues, on a mission in hostile Japan. Both directors said Mr. Garfield possessed a moral conviction necessary for playing their protagonists, each of whom happen to be devout and forced to face down Japanese antagonists. Mr. Garfield, who is 33, said he could not have done \u201cHacksaw\u201d were it not for the intensive preparation he underwent for \u201cSilence. \u201d For the Scorsese film, which was produced first but released second, he spent a year under the tutelage of the Jesuit priest and author Father James Martin, praying, fasting, using a small rented West Village apartment as a   retreat and undergoing rigorous spiritual exercises. \u201cI got not only a theological education, but a deep spiritually transformative experience,\u201d Mr. Garfield said, his brown eyes blazing with the intensity of a tractor beam. Lithe and nimble  \u2014   not for nothing was he    \u2014   and as finely tuned as a whippet, Mr. Garfield came across as a friendly, engaged presence, with a crackling intelligence that Mr. Gibson described as \u201cthrough the roof. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something about fasting, about being empty enough to allow the spirit in, to hear and to listen and to be guided,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cTo be with that silent void, that chaos in ourselves, that\u2019s what the character goes through. He gets the most profound bliss and joy because he hangs in there with the void, with the seeming darkness. \u201d Mr. Garfield met to chat at the Sunset Marquis in West Hollywood, a spot arranged by his publicist even though Mr. Garfield was staying on the city\u2019s east side he was in production for the coming noir thriller \u201cUnder the Silver Lake. \u201d The Marquis is deluxe  \u2014   \u201cthrough the breezeway and over the koi bridge\u201d were a clerk\u2019s directions to the restaurant  \u2014   and couldn\u2019t have been farther from the spartan surroundings Mr. Garfield put himself in to prepare for \u201cSilence. \u201d That spiritual work, in turn, seems to have left Mr. Garfield ever more at odds with the Hollywood culture he has resisted even as his star has steadily risen. The night before, he\u2019d attended the Governors Awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 annual   gala. While Mr. Garfield said he marveled at the screened montages of the night\u2019s honorary award winners, he was painfully aware of the constant inflation and deflation of egos, including his own. \u201cIt\u2019s a really sick old Hollywood kind of patriarchal value system, based on commerce and money and who\u2019s the hottest and who\u2019s going to bring in the big bucks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that an organization like the academy doesn\u2019t acknowledge and honor talent it\u2019s evident they do. But it coexists with the commerce aspect. Sometimes I feel the tail is wagging the dog. And I struggle with that. \u201d Of course, the reason Mr. Garfield is getting such plum parts is because he is ascending that hierarchy, despite himself. Born in Los Angeles to an English mum and an American father, Mr. Garfield was raised from toddlerhood in Surrey, England. His family was a loving one, he said, and his father was Jewish and resisted the notion that any one people were chosen. Mr. Garfield began acting as a child, working his way up from the theater to British television and then feature films. He came to international attention in 2010 for his lauded performances in \u201cNever Let Me Go\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network. \u201d But it was his casting as   for \u201cThe Amazing  \u201d (2012) and subsequent romance with his   Emma Stone, that catapulted him to a wider fame, which he knew was coming and dreaded when he took the Peter Parker role.   had always been Mr. Garfield\u2019s favorite superhero, and he said he adored the character and couldn\u2019t say no, even though being in such a spotlight made him cringe. \u201cIf I could have kept the mask on the whole time, it would have been better, because I don\u2019t have interest in being known for a character,\u201d Mr. Garfield said of his time as Spidey (he also starred in the 2014 sequel). \u201cI have no interest in being known as a celebrity celebrity is a pretty disgusting word. It\u2019s part of the brainwashing of the culture, part of the false idolatry of those that are only human, and I don\u2019t want to participate in that. \u201d The paparazzi had other ideas, which Mr. Garfield pushed back against. When photographers caught him strolling New York\u2019s streets with Ms. Stone, the pair hid their faces behind handwritten signs directing readers to charity websites. In 2015, when it was announced that another actor would be playing   Mr. Garfield found himself relieved: He wanted to continue working on himself as an actor, which isn\u2019t easy in a franchise. \u201cIt\u2019s a moneymaking exercise, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m criticizing that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to judge that, all I knew is that I found it very painful to be a part of in that regard. \u201d But he had already been spreading his wings. In 2012, Mr. Garfield earned a Tony nomination for his performance as Biff in Broadway\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman,\u201d starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and directed by Mike Nichols. Mr. Nichols became one of Mr. Garfield\u2019s dearest mentors, and his death, along with Mr. Hoffman\u2019s in 2014  \u2014   \u201cI\u2019m so lucky I got to brush my soul against him every night,\u201d Mr. Garfield said  \u2014   left him lastingly bereft. The performance was recommended to Mr. Scorsese, who was finally getting a passion project three decades in the making off the ground. In 2013, while Mr. Garfield was in the middle of \u201cThe Amazing   2,\u201d he found himself in Mr. Scorsese\u2019s Upper West Side offices for an audition that would last three hours, and leave the director thrilled. \u201cI felt the film come alive at that point,\u201d Mr. Scorsese wrote in an email. \u201cAndrew let me know right away that he had to go deep into the role and that it had to take time  \u2014   he had to live it. \u201d This would involve intensive work with Father Martin, who, despite his initial wariness, ended up guiding Mr. Garfield through St. Ignatius Loyola\u2019s Spiritual Exercises, which often mark the summit of a spiritual journey. \u201cGod drew him into the exercises immediately,\u201d Father Martin said. \u201cAt one point, Marty said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry you won\u2019t be with me in Taiwan. We won\u2019t have an expert in Jesuit spirituality with us.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, you will, you\u2019ll have Andrew. \u2019\u201d The production was in 2015, and shortly after Mr. Garfield returned, he read the script for \u201cHacksaw Ridge. \u201d It was positioned as a comeback for Mr. Gibson, who had been disgraced a decade earlier for drunkenly spewing   epithets. Mr. Garfield said he read the script, wept  \u2014   Mr. Doss had   rescued 75 men from a brutal battleground in Japan  \u2014   and that any hesitation he might have had vanished after he asked Mr. Gibson about the controversy  . \u201cWe talked about everything, all about that period in his life, and the years since, and his sobriety, and the work he\u2019s done and the healing he\u2019s done within himself, and those others that he consulted and hurt,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very loving man, a crazy loyal man, sensitive and caretaking, and he\u2019s not drinking, and it\u2019s a really beautiful, beautiful thing. \u201d As for Mr. Gibson, he said Mr. Garfield filled every hope he had. \u201cThe pump was primed,\u201d Mr. Gibson said over the phone. \u201cThis character needed to be profound down to the bootstraps of his soul. \u201d After a few months\u2019 breather once filming wrapped, Mr. Garfield quickly went back to work and he\u2019s also starring this year in a revival of \u201cAngels in America\u201d in the West End. But his very immediate future is being dictated by awards  \u2014   his work in \u201cHacksaw\u201d also landed a Screen Actors Guild award, and the Golden Globes are Sunday, Jan. 8  \u2014   meaning he\u2019ll be back on red carpets, schmoozing again, a reluctant cog in the Hollywood machine.'"}, "time": 1742562265.7622008}
