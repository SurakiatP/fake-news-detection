In December, it was revealed that over one billion Yahoo users had been affected by a hack, just months after a previous hack was announced and reportedly covered up by the company. In both incidents, users had their names, email addresses, dates of birth, security questions and answers, phone numbers, and hashed passwords stolen by hackers, including the details of over 150, 000 government employees. Yahoo was reportedly aware of the first large hack, which led to over 500 million account details being stolen, in 2014. However, they failed to announce the incident to the public until late 2016. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s investigation looks into whether Yahoo disclosed information about the data breaches in timely enough fashion,\u201d wrote USA Today on the subject. \u201cSEC rules require companies to disclose data breaches and cyberattacks as soon as it is determined the incidents could have an effect on investors. \u201d \u201cAs part of its investigation, the SEC last month requested documents from Yahoo,\u201d they continued. \u201cThe agency has been seeking a model case for cybersecurity rules it issued in 2011. \u201d Mayer\u2019s reign as CEO of Yahoo has often been controversial, with the CEO facing a lawsuit last year that claimed she purposely purged male employees, and with several employees of Tumblr, the popular   platform owned by Yahoo, also claiming that Mayer and her management were responsible for the decline of the social network. In January 2016, Mayer also faced a backlash after making a joke to employees about the number of layoffs at the company. \u201cNo layoffs  \u2026     this week!\u201d joked Mayer, in response to questions raised by concerned employees. A New York Times report also claimed that Mayer had denied repeated requests for additional investment in Yahoo\u2019s cybersecurity, with the security team allegedly derisively referred to as \u201cparanoids\u201d inside the company. Following both hacking incidents, and the revelation that Yahoo had been secretly scanning user emails for U. S. intelligence agencies, Verizon reportedly sought a significant discount on its purchase of the company, though the exact figure is currently unknown. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
