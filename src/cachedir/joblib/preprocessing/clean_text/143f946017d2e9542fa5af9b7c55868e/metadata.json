The foundation became a major issue in the race , with Donald Trump vowing to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate it. \\nWhether that effort will go forward is not clear. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), head of the House Oversight Committee, has indicated a probe into the foundation will continue. \\nNot only did contributions drop, but so did revenue the Clintons brought in from speeches. That income fell to $357,500 from $3.6 million in 2014. \\nBy the time the foundation\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative held its annual conference in September 2015, many donors had bailed, including Samsung and ExxonMobil. \\nDonna Shalala, the former Health and Human Services secretary who was brought in to run the charity last year, suffered a stroke after the CGI meeting. \\nThe foundation had been rocked by internal divisions after daughter Chelsea Clinton took a more active role in the organization in 2013, when the group was renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. \\nEric Braverman, a pal of Chelsea\u2019s, was brought in to run the group, but he clashed with Bruce Lindsey, a senior adviser in the Clinton administration who had been CEO and became board chairman. \\nBraverman departed in January 2015 after 18 months, receiving a $330,000 payout, according to the tax filings. Shalala replaced him. \\nThe Clinton Foundation refused to comment, but Shalala told The Chronicle of Philanthropy last month that the foundation had taken in money pledged in earlier years but those donations were recorded on earlier tax filings.'"}, "time": 1742562331.063526}
