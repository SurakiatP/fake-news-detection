[Terror mastermind Hafiz Muhammad Saeed was placed under house arrest in Lahore on January 30, less than ten days after Donald Trump took office. For years, Saeed had been living in the open in Pakistan in spite of a $10 million American bounty for information leading to his arrest and conviction. And yet it took new leadership in Washington D. C. to force the Pakistani government\u2019s hand in getting serious about fighting Islamic extremism.  Lost in the misleading reports about \u201cMuslim bans\u201d and debates about   vetting on refugees from the Middle East has been the Trump administration\u2019s quiet but successful effort behind the scenes to advance policies that crack down on terrorism and the Islamist ideology that fuels it. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed to take a new line toward Pakistan  \u2014   the Islamist government that actively backed the Taliban in its infancy and, in turn, was pivotal in the fundamentalist movement\u2019s ascent in Afghanistan. And Americans won\u2019t soon forget that Osama bin Laden, once the world\u2019s number one terrorist, was found in a conspicuous, $1 million compound in Abbottabad, only hundreds of yards away from a prestigious training center for Pakistani army officers. Though Saeed isn\u2019t a name known widely in the United States and though his arrest barely registered in Western headlines, he was the chief planner behind the 2008 Bombay attacks that killed dozens of Indians. In 1990, he founded    (Army of the Pure) deemed by terrorist experts as \u201cprobably the most dangerous terror group in the world. \u201d The group, among other horrific exploits, orchestrated \u201cIndia\u2019s  \u201d: the 2008 rampage on the Taj Hotel and the Jewish Chabad House in Mumbai, which left 166 people dead and more than 600 injured. Up until the inauguration of Donald Trump, Pakistani officials considered Saeed a   state hero because of his willingness to attack Pakistan\u2019s longtime nemesis, India. What changed? \u201cIt is (Indian Prime Minster Narenda) Modi\u2019s insistence and Trump\u2019s instigation,\u201d Saeed himself asserted. Islamabad, he added, \u201cis helpless before the pressure of Trump and Modi. \u201d On this issue, the terrorist is right. The Pakistani government correctly appreciates that, not only there\u2019s a new and tough sheriff in town, but that he\u2019s got a skilled and receptive partner: a new U. S.  alliance is a mortal threat to Islamist terrorism everywhere. President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Modi together are the worst enemies of terrorists. The two are kindred spirits: committed nationalists and willing to forego the niceties of the political elites in both countries to get things done on behalf of a population eager for more jobs and economic growth. I introduced Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi for their first meeting in July 2016. A deepened relationship between the US and India is already advancing the war against Islamic extremism by leaps and bounds. India is literally on the front line of the defense of freedom it shares a   border with Pakistan, a nuclear weapons nation and one of the world\u2019s leading state sponsors of terrorism. (By contrast, the   border is roughly 1, 255 miles.) Moreover, 84 percent of Pakistan\u2019s 180 million Muslims support sharia law as official law while only 28 percent hold an \u201cunfavorable\u201d view of ISIS. Trump and Modi, both proud unapologetic patriots and champions of entrepreneurialism, have been friendly for a while. This has become especially apparent though within the past several months. On October 15, the Republican Hindu Coalition held the Humanity United Against Terror charity event at the New Jersey Convention  Expo Center in Edison, New Jersey. In his speech,   candidate Trump promised India and the US would be \u201cbest friends. \u201d He continued, \u201cThere won\u2019t be any relationship more important to us. \u201d After the election, he  \u2014   revealingly  \u2014   reached out to Modi before contacting the head of any major European nation. The White House subsequently issued a statement, stressing, \u201cthe United States considers India a true friend and partner in addressing challenges around the world. \u201d Quartz heralded the arrival of a \u201cbromance. \u201d Robust and enduring is the bond between America, the world\u2019s oldest democracy, and India, the world\u2019s most populous democracy. It was from the very beginning forged by a mutual reverence for liberty and constitutional republicanism. It was quickly reinforced by a mutual passion for industry and innovation. And today it is further bolstered by a shared yearning to eliminate, once and for all, the scourge of Islamic extremism. We must rejoice that the people replaced an    with a   . We ought to celebrate the fact that, finally, the international relationship exists to strike at the heart of an enemy that Obama\u2019s administration refused to even name. And, out of an unending love of freedom, we should welcome strengthened ties between Washington and New Delhi. Given its long overdue crackdown, Pakistan clearly recognizes the dynamics have fundamentally changed. If Islamic extremists didn\u2019t also realize this after 10, 000 Indian Americans rose to their feet and loudly cheered Trump in October and more than two million Hindus voted for Trump in November, then they soon will.
