His eyebrows and mustache are unruly, and his long gray hair overlaps his ears. He wears a white suit that is too warm in summer and not warm enough in winter. The only obvious problem with Klaus Mombrei\u2019s performance, as he leads tour groups through the city, is something Twain himself would have found amusing: He speaks not   English but his native German. \u201cSurely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless and so slippery and elusive to the grasp,\u201d Twain fumed in his 1880 European travelogue \u201cA Tramp Abroad. \u201d And yet, despite his problems with German, Twain was smitten with the country. \u201cGermany, in the summer, is the perfection of the beautiful,\u201d he gushed. He was especially fond of Heidelberg, where he lived with his family in the summer of 1878. The city was \u201cthe last possibility of the beautiful,\u201d he wrote, straining to surpass the superlative he had lavished on the country. Heidelberg curls up against the Neckar River in a narrow pass between a pair of mountains, like a flower preserved between two books. As Mr. Mombrei leads tours of visitors (mostly Germans) over the cobblestone streets, he likes to share a popular local legend. \u201cI tell my groups Twain got the idea for the \u2018Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u2019 from the Neckar,\u201d he said. \u201cA Tramp Abroad\u201d includes the story of a raft journey down the river and was published several years before \u201cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn. \u201d Many people in Heidelberg believe, therefore, that the Neckar was the creative headwater to Twain\u2019s Mississippi. In fact, the fictional river trip was already racing through his mind. Twain had started the novel before he went to Germany, but the draft was stalled shortly after Huck and Jim destroyed their raft in a collision with a steamship. No wonder, then, that Twain watched timber rafts rushing down the Neckar, \u201choping to see one of them hit the   and wreck itself. \u201d He was in a creative crisis. This crucial chapter in Twain\u2019s career is often overlooked. So I set out to understand it better by retracing his footsteps in the region. Heidelberg survived World War II with only minor damage, so visitors today can still experience the romantic charm Twain found. Church towers crane above the red roofs, while the medieval main street, Hauptstrasse, meanders through the center of the city. The famous castle ruins loom high on the mountainside, a   mosaic caulked with moss and tiny plants. In the afternoon, Twain and his family would gather in the castle park for beer and music. When I visited, a theater troupe was rehearsing \u201cKiss Me, Kate. \u201d Twain stayed at the Schloss hotel, the finest lodging in Heidelberg at the time. The building was on a bluff even higher than the castle, so that Twain could stand on his balcony and drink in the entire city. \u201cI have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm,\u201d he wrote in \u201cA Tramp Abroad. \u201d In the evening, Heidelberg became \u201ca fallen Milky Way   \u2026     its intricate cobweb of streets jeweled with twinkling lights. \u201d Today, the Schloss hotel has been rebuilt as private residences, a boring beige box floating like a Mario Block on its perch above the city. I stayed across the river at the Hirschgasse, a former student pub that Twain could see from his hotel window. In Twain\u2019s time, the Hirschgasse was the battleground for Heidelberg University\u2019s fencing fraternities, whose members were identifiable by their caps and facial scars. Today the Hirschgasse features two of Heidelberg\u2019s best restaurants: the upscale French restaurant Le Gourmet and the German Mensurstube, where the tables are scratched with the signatures of former students and the walls decorated with fencing caps, sabers and old photographs. Other fraternity watering holes from Twain\u2019s time are still in business. On the Hauptstrasse, Zum Seppl and Zum Roten Ochsen both serve German comfort food: bratwurst, cheese spaetzle and white asparagus  \u2014   a springtime specialty whose nutritional value Germans like to obliterate with Hollandaise sauce and ham. The fencing duels fascinated Twain. At the Hirschgasse, he saw \u201cthe heads and faces of ten youths gashed in every direction. \u201d You might have expected him to foil such pointless violence with common sense and wit, but he thought the ritual deserved \u201ca considerable degree of respect. \u201d Throughout \u201cA Tramp Abroad,\u201d Twain\u2019s critical faculties seem somewhat dulled. He describes the German people with clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9. Twain\u2019s Germans are orderly, clean, punctual and brave. In his letters, he praises the country\u2019s \u201cgenuine freedom\u201d and \u201csuperb government\u201d at a time of political and social upheaval. The emperor was nearly assassinated twice during Twain\u2019s visit. Twain cultivated his ignorance intentionally. \u201cI don\u2019t read any newspapers,\u201d he wrote to a friend. \u201cAh, I have such a deep, grateful, unutterable sense of being \u2018out of it all.\u2019 \u201d When Twain arrived in Germany, his writer\u2019s block had hamstrung not only \u201cHuckleberry Finn\u201d but also several other books, including \u201cLife on the Mississippi\u201d and \u201cThe Prince and the Pauper. \u201d And he had humiliated himself in December 1877 with an irreverent speech in Boston before some of America\u2019s greatest literary figures: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Oliver Wendell Holmes. \u201cI feel that my misfortune has injured me all over the country,\u201d he wrote to a friend. He told his mother that he needed to \u201cfly to some little corner of Europe. \u201d I arrived in Heidelberg in June with some sense of Twain\u2019s restlessness. When I told a friend that I was having trouble concentrating, he said I should stay present: open my senses to whatever was happening at the moment, and exist in the world instead of in my head. As I reread \u201cA Tramp Abroad,\u201d knowing that Twain had arrived in Germany under a cloud of shame and failure, it seemed to me that he had faced a similar challenge. His goal was not so much to penetrate Heidelberg and the Neckar Valley but to soak his senses in those places, to dissolve his insecurity in the scenery and to rediscover his pride and purpose. This comes through clearest in Twain\u2019s Neckar narrative, so I followed him upriver. From Heidelberg, I took a boat to Neckarsteinach, an old town with a quartet of castle ruins. The river winds between hills like a lazy cursive signature. Time has worked slowly on its banks: The terrain is still mainly field and forest the mountains robed in thick green foliage. Every few miles our boat passed a village with   teenagers and rows of simple white homes. After sundown, the buildings glowed like votive candles in the dark. The inns where Twain stayed along the Neckar have closed, but some of his favorite castle ruins are now connected with hotels. Burg Hornberg is a mountaintop fortress surrounded by terraced vineyards, with a tower so high that surely, at some point, someone must have locked a princess in it. The hotel\u2019s impressive view of the Neckar is marred only slightly by an industrial plant. Farther downstream, you can stay at the Schlosshotel Hirschhorn, whose ruins were one of Twain\u2019s favorite Neckar sights. \u201cThe clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop, and the old battlemented stone wall, stretching up and over the grassy ridge and disappearing in the leafy sea beyond, make a picture whose grace and beauty entirely satisfy the eye,\u201d he wrote in \u201cA Tramp Abroad. \u201d Twain\u2019s Neckar story is filled with these moments of sensory immersion. He luxuriates in the \u201cgreen and fragrant banks,\u201d the vineyards, the poppy fields. In these sensual descriptions, Twain\u2019s language often turns therapeutic. The raft, he wrote, \u201csoothes to sleep all nervous hurry and impatience under its restful influence all the troubles and vexations and sorrows that harass the mind vanish away. \u201d In Germany, Twain was finding the equilibrium that had deserted him at home. Writing \u201cA Tramp Abroad\u201d would frustrate Twain immensely: His writer\u2019s block had not yet lifted. But in the Neckar journey, one can detect the shoots of creative rejuvenation. He spins the legend of a German knight named Sir Wissenschaft, who slays a dragon not with a sword but with a fire extinguisher  \u2014   a precursor to the   hero of \u201cA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court. \u201d The greatest sign of Twain\u2019s revival is the Neckar raft itself. Twain never rafted down the river: He traveled the region by boat, foot and train and invented the raft only later as a narrative device. It had emerged from his subconscious and back into his active imagination. And when he picked up the draft of \u201cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d in 1879, the raft was still afloat: He found a way forward by repairing Huck and Jim\u2019s raft after the steamship accident and continuing their journey down the Mississippi. As my boat pushed upstream, I tried to absorb the greenery, the   breeze, the sound of water breaking on the hull. By tuning his senses to this place, Twain started to clear his mind, and his inspiration began to flow more freely. After \u201cA Tramp Abroad,\u201d he would have the greatest decade of his career, publishing \u201cThe Prince and the Pauper,\u201d \u201cLife on the Mississippi,\u201d \u201cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d and \u201cA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court. \u201d And when he got stuck or frustrated with the writing process, perhaps he remembered the quiet music of the Neckar, that narrow river whose sound \u201cbears up the thread of one\u2019s imaginings as an accompaniment bears up a song. \u201d The Hirschgasse The former dueling ground of Heidelberg University\u2019s fencing fraternities, it is now a small luxury hotel with two of the city\u2019s best restaurants.
