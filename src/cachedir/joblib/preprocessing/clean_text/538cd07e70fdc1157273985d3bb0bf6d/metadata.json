Still, our political perspectives might be off-putting to some readers on the left. Although you could tune out whatever you don\u2019t agree with. you might do well to take a closer look. Not all of us agree on everything, but we do have a rough consensus on some items.\\nOur views on the political establishment The left blames corporations while the right blames the government, when in reality the two interests work together to subvert the will of the people\\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to see that this site has a mainly conservative perspective, especially on social matters. Not all of us started out that way. Many of us began our journey away from the political orthodoxy after realizing what a mess feminism has made of society. Others have been turned off by political correctness. Once upon a time, I used to be liberal, and I know I\u2019m not the only one. Be that as it may, some of us are actually friendly to liberalism .\\nBy the way, we don\u2019t give a free pass to the mainstream conservative establishment either. Unfortunately, the government in countless ways seeks to amass power for itself while producing fear and dependency in the populace. Really, it\u2019s not a Democrat problem or Republican problem; they\u2019re basically two sides of the same coin. Heads, they win; tails, you lose.\\nSurely you\u2019re in favor of progress. One good question, though, is what exactly this constitutes . Also, who gets to define what is progress? All that might seem rhetorical, but these are important matters. Likely you see change as a good thing. But who\u2019s setting the agenda, deciding which direction that change goes? Actually, we have answers for all that.\\nIn fact, we might have some more in common with you than you expect. Don\u2019t care for agribusiness? Neither do we . Are you troubled by the influence of the ultra-wealthy in the political process? We are too . Do you suspect that the powerful have set up a system of managed democracy, where they\u2019re pulling the purse strings of both the Republicans and the Democrats? (If you supported Bernie Sanders, you\u2019ve probably figured that one out already!) We understand you.\\nToday\u2019s political and social scene \\nYou might be disenchanted by some of the things going on with the Democratic Party today. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of their hypocrisy and contempt for the public . Are you troubled by some of the Clinton scandals, maybe even wondered if there was more to it than you expected ?\\nPerhaps your questioning goes deeper; you might wonder who hijacked liberalism . It once stood for helping the working man, but some time in the 1960s it turned into so much squabbling divisiveness. Actually, there\u2019s a reason for that ; the culture war began long before the 1990s! That wasn\u2019t about liberation, but rather a deliberate attempt to spread divisiveness and weaken the fabric of society.\\nAlso, taxpayers have spent untold money on social programs, but why don\u2019t they solve problems? Instead, they create intergenerational poverty. You might be shocked to learn that encouraging dependency, along with taxing and spending to oblivion, was actually a stratagem meant to crash the system . That\u2019s not about helping the disadvantaged; it\u2019s about using them! Schemes like these\u2014causing societal upheaval so a Socialist paradise will magically fall into place\u2014are pretty reckless.\\nYou might shake your head in bewilderment at online mobs of misguided youths spewing bile about things that don\u2019t really matter. Sure, you\u2019re against police brutality (as am I), but deep down you also fear what will come of all this open contempt for the law and violence against police . The authorities take a pretty dim view of cop killers; kind of sounds like someone behind the scenes wants to start a lot of trouble, doesn\u2019t it?\\nFinally, you might wonder if the people on top of the liberal establishment really give a damn about the common people. We think it\u2019s rotten that they\u2019re using so many well-meaning people for the cynical ends of amassing money and power.\\nLikely you have some nagging concerns about what\u2019s going on in society today. Why are women both liberated and spoiled , and sometimes even hostile? Can\u2019t the feminists see that things aren\u2019t really so bad ? Sure, you\u2019re all about tolerance and have lots of gay friends, but you privately wonder if there should be sensible limits . You might be uncomfortable with all the evangelizing of \u201calternative lifestyles\u201d, especially if you have children in school.\\nYou consider the press to be the bedrock of a free society, but you have doubts about journalistic integrity . Hey, we understand. The propaganda is everywhere, even in shows for young children . The media has been feeding you bullshit all your life, and we think their lying is rotten. You deserve better than that.\\nStarting to reconsider? \\nA die-hard Social Justice Warrior will seethe with rage for me bringing up these uncomfortable facts. Even if you\u2019re a moderate, you might be reluctant to consider any of this. We understand; rethinking deeply held beliefs is a painful process. For so many things, you\u2019ll see that what you\u2019ve been told is right is actually wrong, and what is \u201cwrong\u201d is really right.\\nMany on the left have been there before and found their way out. For me, someone explained that I\u2019m not responsible for the world\u2019s problems. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d The endless attempts in college to ram opinions down my throat hardened my resolve. Others who\u2019ve made the journey have different stories. Some got religion. Others realized that their past fanaticism has hurt others . Some wondered why decades of costly social programs haven\u2019t accomplished anything. Some came to see that preferential treatment in hiring decisions is anything but \u201cfairness\u201d.\\nIt\u2019s in your best interests to purge the misconceptions and guilt trips from your mind. Still, you don\u2019t have to abandon everything and embrace the polar opposite. Some have reached a synthesis position .\\nWelcome to the other side \\nIf you\u2019ve read this far with an open mind\u2014and checked out some of the referenced articles\u2014then you might be confused. Perhaps you\u2019re tempted to reject our message. On the other hand, you might be shocked and even angry about what\u2019s been going on in politics and society.\\nWe understand; enlightenment is a painful process. We\u2019re here for you. The truth hurts, but we\u2019ll do the best we can to tell it like it is, which is much more than can be said for what you\u2019ll see on television. I\u2019ve merely scratched the surface here; stick with us and you\u2019ll see how deep the rabbit hole goes.\\nRead More: The 12 Step Social Justice Warrior Recovery Program \\n'"}, "time": 1742628509.1249301}
