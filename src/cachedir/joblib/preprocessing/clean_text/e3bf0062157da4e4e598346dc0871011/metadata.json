By Oct. 24, AT&T announced that Time Warner had agreed to be bought out by the telecommunications giant for $85.4 billion. \\nCurrently, Time Warner represents one of a shrinking number of mass media conglomerates that increasingly control the vast majority of news available to Americans. AT&T is one of the world\u2019s largest providers of mobile phone and landline services, and, as owner of DirecTV, a major player in the television marketplace as well. \\nCorporate executives have promised that the merger could make more content available to consumers , offer new options for mobile viewing , and provide alternatives to traditional cable TV. Representatives of both companies have also tried to mollify concerns that the deal would violate antitrust laws, claiming it represents the \u201cvertical integration\u201d of two different markets , rather than a merger of competitors. \\nMany media experts have expressed concern and skepticism about these claims, particularly in regard to the potential benefits to consumers. Wood suggested AT&T\u2019s buyout of DirecTV, which was completed in July 2015 , should serve as a warning about the possible effects of this new, larger merger model. He warned: \\n\u201cThe deals are driven by Wall Street\u2019s insatiable desire for short-term growth at any cost. And just as AT&T\u2019s recent purchase of DirecTV was quickly followed by price hikes, there\u2019s every reason to expect this potential tie-up would cost internet users and TV viewers dearly too.\u201d \\nKevin Kelleher , a reporter at Time magazine, weighed in on Oct. 24. He wrote that the deal \u201cmakes sense for media executives, less so for consumers,\u201d as it\u2019s unclear how bringing content creators and internet service providers together would actually benefit the end user. He continued: \\n\u201cFor now, concerns over the deal seem to be outweighing the benefits, which could end up being negligible. For decades, the pipes that streamed digital content remained largely independent from the companies that provided the content. And no consumers complained.\u201d \\nMeanwhile, several senators have come out in opposition to the proposed merger, citing concerns about the ultimate implications for consumers, the role of Washington\u2019s \u201crevolving door\u201d into the corporate world, and what this buyout could mean for the future of media consolidation. \\nOn Sunday, Al Franken , a former TV actor and senator representing Minnesota, told The New York Times\u2019 media reporter Jim Rutenberg that the merger could increase prices and reduce the number of choices available to consumers. \\n\u201cWhen the company that controls the pipes, so to speak, owns this very, very large content provider, it can cause a whole bunch of different horribles for consumers,\u201d Franken said. \\nElizabeth Warren , a senator from Massachusetts known for her consumer advocacy, objected to Christine Varney\u2019s involvement in the deal. Varney, an antitrust lawyer who has been hired to oversee the AT&T and Time Warner merger, previously worked for the Obama administration investigating antitrust claims. On Monday, Warren told Fortune: \\n\u201cAmericans have had it with regulators like Varney, who talk a good game about holding the bad guys accountable while counting down the days until they can collect a fat paycheck from the corporations they were supposed to regulate. The revolving door is out of control. If we want to hold corporate lawbreakers accountable, we can\u2019t ask their friends to do it.\u201d \\nBernie Sanders , the senator from Vermont and former 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, also objected to the deal in an open letter published Wednesday on Medium. In addition to echoing the concerns shared by others like Franken, he warned that the buyout could provoke future media mergers that would further consolidate an already limited market. \\n\u201cAt a time when our telecommunications and media industries are already too concentrated, we should be focused on opening those markets to more competition, not less,\u201d he wrote. \\nIn the case that the merger does go through, AT&T\u2019s ties to the national security state may also give rise to serious privacy concerns. A day after the AT&T-Time Warner merger was officially announced, Kenneth Lipp, a reporter at The Daily Beast, revealed that AT&T is storing customer information and selling it for profit . That, of course, came more than three years after Edward Snowden leaked classified information which detailed the telecommunications giant\u2019s close collaboration with the NSA to spy on millions of Americans. \\n\u201cWhere you go, what you watch, text and share, with whom you speak, all your internet searches and preferences, all gathered and \u2018vertically integrated,\u2019 sold to police and perhaps, in the future, to any number of AT&T\u2019s corporate customers,\u201d Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman and her frequent collaborator, Denis Moynihan, wrote in an editorial published on Thursday . \\n\u201cWe can\u2019t know if Alexander Graham Bell envisioned this brave new digital world when he invented the telephone. But this is the future that is fast approaching, unless people rise up and stop this merger.\u201d Be Sociable, Share!'"}, "time": 1742564195.7233562}
