An electoral board showing France\u2019s far-right National Front president Marine Le Pen and reading: 100% National Front. 0% migrants is pictured during a demonstration in Forges-les-Bains, south of Paris, France, Saturday, Oct. 8, 2016. \\nFrance\u2019s National Front is known to have diverse funding streams, but an investigation published this week unveiled a new potential funder: the United Arab Emirates. \\nIt is certainly an odd source of funding for a party whose leader, Marine Le Pen, has been taken to court for anti-Muslim hate speech. \\nLe Pen\u2019s Russian networks are already well known: in 2014, the National Front received a loan of \u20ac11mn ($12mn) from the First Czech Russian Bank. \\nThis fact was admitted by the party\u2019s treasurer, Wallerand de Saint-Just, who said: \u201cThe party makes requests to foreign banks, why not Russian banks?\u201d \\nThe latest controversy was sparked by a book by famed French investigative journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot. In 2004, the journalistic duo were even held hostage at one point by Islamic militants in Iraq. \\nTitled Nos tr\u00e8s chers \u00e9mirs (Our dear emirs), their latest book exposes the murky relationship between a number of French politicians and the countries of the Arabian Gulf. \\nIn the wake of the controversy caused by the book\u2019s publication, the news website Mediapart has raised the question of possible funding of Marine Le Pen\u2019s presidential campaign by the UAE. \\nA source familiar with the far-right French party told Middle East Eye: \u201cIt is true that in 2014 Marine Le Pen met an Emirati emissary in her residence in Montrebout, in the Hauts-de-Seine region, who offered to help her. \\n\u201cThat being said, the FN [National Front] has always been clear on this point: it has two enemies, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which it regards as sponsors of wahhabism, but in her eyes the Emiratis are an ally in the fight against radicalisation.\u201d \\nWahhabism is an ultra-orthodox strand of Sunni Islam practised in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, and it has become an increasingly popular theme to explain the chaos gripping the Middle East. \\n\u201cFrance must break its relations with Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which helped, assisted, and funded Islamic fundamentalists worldwide,\u201d Le Pen said in September 2014 on France 24. \\n\u201cWe must rely on those Muslim countries which fight fundamentalism,\u201d she added, naming the UAE and Egypt as examples of such countries and calling for \u201ca wide coalition\u201d against Islamic extremism. \\nIn 2014, pro-Le Pen French MEP Jean-Luc Schaffhauser told Mediapart that he had negotiated a loan at a rate of 2.8 percent with the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, but that it in the event it did not materialize. \\nThe following year in May, Le Pen travelled to Cairo to meet with the Grand Imam of al-Azhar Mosque \u2013 a trip allegedly funded by the UAE, according to Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot. \\nThe allegation was denied earlier this week by National Front MEP and Secretary General Nicolas Bay, who told France 2 television: \u201cThat is incorrect.\u201d \\n\u201cFor now, about 50 percent of the campaign should be funded by Cotelec, the FN\u2019s funding organisation that is chaired by Jean-Marie Le Pen,\u201d the source close to the party told MEE. \\nThese loans granted to the party by its members will be refunded once the state has itself reimbursed the campaign. This rule applies to all parties that win more than 5 percent of the vote in the first round of the elections. \\n\u201cThe needs for the first round are estimated at around \u20ac12mn, and \u20ac21mn for the second round. For the first round, they still lack \u20ac6-7 million, but they are aware of the fact that appealing to the Gulf countries harm them in terms of image,\u201d the source added. \\n\u201cSo at first, the goal is to look for loans in European countries. If this is not enough, they will turn to the Russians, and thirdly, to the UAE. We can say that this is an option, but a third choice option.\u201d \\nThe National Front has indicated that around 40 banks have refused to lend it money. Yet polls assure that Le Pen will win more than the 5 percent of votes needed to be reimbursed by the state. \\n\u201cIf we have to borrow abroad, we will borrow abroad,\u201d Wallerand de Saint-Just, the party\u2019s treasurer, told France 3. \u201cThere are no exceptions to this, either in Russia, Argentina, or in the United States\u2026 and why not in the Middle East?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562095.5356257}
