It is way past time to take back the media, and fill it with truth-tellers, not apologists. \\n\u201cMore than 150 teens, spread out in groups of 20 or 30, descended upon the campus at around 8:30 p.m. Friday \u2014 wreaking havoc for nearly two hours before eventually dispersing,\u201d according to NBC 10 . Temple News reported that \u201cmultiple students were hurt and businesses had to close Friday evening due to a \u2018flash mob\u2019 of nearly 200 minors that flocked North Broad Street near Main Campus, police said.\u201d \\nBut there is a reason for all of this horror, according to Solomon Jones of Philly.com .

As America threatens to shatter, we must see how a semi-covert, global, cartel collective and their NWO in the USA (\"progressive\" neo-Marxists and neo-fascists corporatists, updated with 21st Century techniques and technology) intentionally perpetrate this sabotage, while we patriots try to prevent it.

If it comes to it, do not even respond in kind, until after the after the first times that extreme, anti-American violence is done by them. It calls for an attitude of self sacrifice -- first cheek, second cheek, then no more. \\nAnd speak out about the potential and strategic \"sense\" of the Obama/NWO\\'s DHS carrying out false flag missions of violence, blaming it on American patriots, perhaps upon our militia movements. \\nWe are in a real war, right now (of which others and I have been trying to alert fellow Sovereign Citizens for years) and the prime war is for the minds, hearts, and wills of the American People. We are opposed by an anti-American insurrection using any means of power (see Gramsci, Frankfurt School) including government power, as they are granted that opportunity.'"}, "time": 1742561987.9970725}
