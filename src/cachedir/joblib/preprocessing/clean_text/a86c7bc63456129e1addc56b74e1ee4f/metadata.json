[In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter this week, Handler said she believes President Donald Trump loves the \u201cgun lobby\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a sh*t about people. \u201d  In fact, Handler contends that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about anybody. \u201d Handler told THR: Obviously, [the state of] gun control in this country is totally unacceptable, and the gun lobby is so strong and so powerful that anytime a celebrity can bring attention to this cause  \u2014   among many other [causes]  \u2014   you know it\u2019s an easy thing for anyone to do. We\u2019re way behind the times in terms of gun control in this country, and it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going anywhere anytime soon. Our voices just need to keep getting louder, and the people that make an impact need to really just step up and stick their necks out a little bit more. THR then pointed to the NRA\u2019s support of Trump during last year\u2019s campaign campaign and Trump\u2019s   Amendment stance then and now. Handler responded, \u201cPeople need to be louder than ever with this president and his relationship to the gun lobby. He doesn\u2019t give a s \u2014  about people. He doesn\u2019t care about anybody. \u201d The host of Netflix\u2019s Chelsea also appeared to suggest that gun ownership is nothing more than a \u201chobby. \u201d \u201cNobody is trying to take away your guns. If you want to go shoot, you know, whatever, in the woods, that\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a hobby,\u201d she told THR. \u201cIf your hobby is [affecting] innocent people being killed all the time, children included, don\u2019t you think you should reconsider the lack of restrictions placed on your hobby?\u201d Handler mentioned a few specific gun controls she believes are needed, such as \u201cheightened  \u2026     restrictions on buying guns. \u201d The left has been pursuing such restrictions in the form of universal background checks for decades, but the American people have continually elected people \u2014  either to Congress, the White House, or both \u2014  who will prevent such checks from being put in place. The opposition to the checks springs from the understanding that they not the real goal of the left. Rather, the goal is the gun registration that follows such checks (see California). Moreover, the American people have rejected such checks because they do not work determined attackers still kill large numbers of innocents at will with firearms, knives,   trucks. After all, France has universal background checks, yet they witnessed 142 innocents gunned down by terrorists in 2015 alone. London has such checks too, but that did not stop three attackers from driving a van into pedestrians on London Bridge on June 3, 2017, then chasing and stabbing innocents in Borough Market. Closer to home. California has universal background checks, but that did not prevent the May 23, 2014 Santa Barbara attack, the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino attack, the June 1, 2016, UCLA   or the October 8, 2016, ambush and murder of two Palm Springs police officers. Additionally, the attacks in France and the one in San Bernardino occurred in   zones, and Trump condemned such zones from the campaign trail, arguing that citizens ought to be able to be armed to shoot back. On January 10, 2016, just over after month after the San Bernardino attack, Trump told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press: If in Paris or if in California recently, where the fourteen people were killed and probably others to follow \u2014  in terms of that group because you have some people who are very, very badly wounded \u2014  if in Paris they had guns or if in California [they had guns,] on the other side, where the bullets go both ways, not just in one direction. You wouldn\u2019t have had the kind of carnage that you had. That does not sound like a man who \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about anybody. \u201d Instead, it sounds like a man that wants American citizens to have a fighting chance should a terror attack occur.
