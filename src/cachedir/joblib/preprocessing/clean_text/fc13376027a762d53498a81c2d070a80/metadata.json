He said : \\n\u201cThe tramps and drunks sleeping in doorways. What we need to do is get them by the scruff of the neck and deal with them. People have said they\u2019d go into Bradford if they were eliminated.\u201d \\nHe claimed that while plans to redevelop the city centre were all well and good, the investment had been ruined by the homeless. \\nSo what exactly does Mr Heseltine envisage when he suggests grabbing the homeless \u201cby the scruff of the neck\u201d and eliminating them? \\nEvolvePolitics reports: \\nWhy Councillor Heseltine believes that perpetrating an assault on the homeless would rectify the problem is a mystery. He would be better advised to encourage his colleagues to work towards providing people with homes, opportunities for employment, improving mental health services and providing interventions for alcohol and drug addiction. \\nThe \u2018Nasty Party\u2019 Councillor said that he had spoken to people who claimed that they would not visit Bradford city centre due to the number of drinkers and beggars. \\nHeseltine is correct in his assertion that Bradford council \u2013 like many other councils \u2013 places the town centre aesthetic above the needs of those that live in and around them. However, his suggestions for dealing with the problem of homelessness are utterly reprehensible. These are people, not dogs or vermin to be disposed of to make your town look just a little better. \\nMost people are never more than three paychecks away from being homeless. Our elected representatives would be well advised to remember that.'"}, "time": 1742561704.1040425}
