Louie Gohmert ( ) told Breitbart News Daily he was \u201cexcited\u201d by President Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. [\u201cThis is exactly why I got behind Donald Trump,\u201d he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. \u201cThis is why I was excited election night, is because we all expected Trump to keep his word. He has. He picked somebody from the list, and, in fact, he didn\u2019t just pick somebody from the list he may have picked the very best person from the list. \u201d  \u201cThis is a man that, as far as we know, has not ruled on an abortion case, but we know from what he has ruled on that he believes in the Constitution,\u201d Gohmert noted. \u201cHe believes that we have a right to religious freedom. Just as the government\u2019s not to establish a religion, they\u2019re not to prohibit the free exercise. We\u2019ve had some justices  \u2014   we\u2019ve still got them on the court  \u2014   that believe that the government can restrict the peaceful exercise and they can force people to go against their religious beliefs. If Hillary Clinton had made this selection, I think our religious freedom would be over. But it\u2019s not. \u201d  \u201cWe have a good man. This guy is such a good candidate,\u201d he declared. \u201cI know the President and others have said he may be able to rule as a Supreme Court justice for maybe 30 more years. I\u2019m hoping 40 years! I\u2019m going to be praying for his good health. \u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m simply praying that the Senate will do their jobs and get this guy confirmed. They confirmed him ten years ago,\u201d Gohmert pointed out. \u201cThey had reviewed for anything that they\u2019d like to bring against him ten years ago because he was going to be on the Court of Appeals, and those are critically important positions. There wasn\u2019t anything there ten years ago. Once he\u2019s on the Court of Appeals, then every Court of Appeals justice has in the back of their minds, \u2018You know, I could be on the Supreme Court someday. I\u2019d better keep my nose clean.\u2019 And so it ought to be a very uneventful hearing. \u201d Gohmert recalled that he was originally a supporter of Senator Ted Cruz ( ) for president in 2016, having \u201cfought in the trenches\u201d with him, but now, he wondered how any serious conservative could complain about President Trump\u2019s selection of Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. In light of this nomination, he pronounced the \u201cNeverTrump\u201d movement among some conservatives a \u201cdisastrous mistake. \u201d \u201cThank goodness those who said, \u2018Never Trump\u2019 did not keep him from being president because that would have been the end of too much,\u201d he said. \u201cSo those who were NeverTrumpers, fine everybody\u2019s entitled to your opinion, but at least you ought to get out there and acknowledge now, \u2018Well, I wasn\u2019t for Trump, but thankfully, he actually did keep his word, and we can all be grateful for that. \u2019\u201d Gohmert said friends in the Senate told him they will make sure Gorsuch gets through the confirmation process, along with President Trump\u2019s remaining cabinet nominees. One senator told him it was important to give Majority Leader Mitch McConnell space and time to shepherd the nominations through in his own way, rather than pressuring him for swift action and fiery confrontations with the Democrats. \u201cThe thing about this nomination, it\u2019s replacing Antonin Scalia,\u201d he said of Gorsuch. \u201cThe Left was pretty well getting their way with the courts, even with Scalia on there, being as conservative and originalist as he was. \u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of feeling that I\u2019m hearing about among some of the Democrats, especially those that are in states that voted for Trump, that, look, this shouldn\u2019t be the one that we fight over,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it\u2019s Ginsburg, then we fight to the death to prevent a conservative, but this is Scalia. We\u2019re not losing anything by getting somebody that might be close to being as conservative as Scalia. So this shouldn\u2019t be where we fight to the death to keep him from being a vote, and this also could be the one that brings those senators that are Democrats in states that voted for Trump, it could be just what brings them down and turns their seat Republican. \u201d Gohmert did not think much of the Democrat claim that Gorsuch is an illegitimate nominee for a seat that was \u201cstolen\u201d from President Barack Obama\u2019s designated successor to Scalia, Merrick Garland. \u201cLast night, I came by the Supreme Court about 9:15, and they already had a massive demonstration out there, signs they were ready to go. They had their magic markers. They were ready to put whoever\u2019s name had been cited by Trump as being terrible,\u201d he observed. \u201cYou know, Have Poster Board, Will Travel. There they were. They were ready to condemn anybody, no matter who had been picked. If Trump had named the most   person in the country, they were out there ready to condemn. \u201d \u201cThis is fake news. This is people who are just out there to create the appearance of obstruction,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, Patrick Poole, remember back in one of the demonstrations on the Mall, caught one of the guys: \u2018Hey, how much are you getting paid?\u2019 He said, \u2018$15 an hour. I thought everybody was getting that.\u2019 They\u2019re getting paid. The Soros money gets spread around. And actually, unfortunately, sometimes it\u2019s our own government money that\u2019s funding some of the obstructionism. But we have got to see this country through this and get Gorsuch confirmed so that this country will go on and still have a chance to survive, with our freedom intact,\u201d he urged. Gohmert noted that every Democrat seems to be reading from a script that Gorsuch\u2019s prospective Supreme Court seat \u201cwas supposed to be Obama\u2019s seat to fill,\u201d as Marlow noted. \u201cThey have the mantra. They might as well have been carrying their statements on a sign, and all they had to do was fill in the blank for the name,\u201d he said, predicting that virtually every Democrat statement about Gorsuch will be prefaced with   \u201cgarbage. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m thanking God he got elected, and he\u2019s keeping his word,\u201d Gohmert said of President Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a day to rejoice for any Republican, anyone who\u2019s a moderate, because otherwise, we get a leftist, and we\u2019re done. So it\u2019s a great day for America. It just really is. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
