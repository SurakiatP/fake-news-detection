Jobs, security, the economy. Trump represents a new direction for America, where the needs of Americans are placed above foreign interests and are greedy donors and lobbyists. Hillary represents the same thing we\u2019ve got now \u2013 a stagnant economy, global politics, and dangerous progressive ideologies. Trump is the candidate of CHANGE. Our dishonest North Korea-style government-run propaganda media whose sole purpose is to spew pro-Hillary rhetoric, anti-Trump lies, and cover up for the most unliked candidate in the history of American elections, says the election is OVER. Hillary has won it. So, why is Hillary on black radio shows saying rappers have \u201cINFLUENCED HER\u201d (hahaha) and going on Hispanic radio, telling everyone that Mexican food is her favorite? Sounds pretty DESPERATE To me. It\u2019s INSULTING too. To think that minorities are so dumb that they\u2019ll vote for someone because they like a certain type of music or food. This is typical \u201cClinton old school politics.\u201d Treating minorities like dullards by pandering to them around \u201cvoting time\u201d and then ignoring them the rest of the time. I believe we\u2019re ALL beyond those silly shenanigans by this point.
