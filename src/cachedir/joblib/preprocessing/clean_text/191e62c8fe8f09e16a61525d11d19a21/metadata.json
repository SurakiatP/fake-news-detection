L. coach and TV commentator, drew diagrams on a screen for viewers watching the 49ers beat the Bengals in Super Bowl XVI. The tool he used is now a staple of sports and weather broadcasts. The Telestrator was invented by Leonard Reiffel, a former NASA scientist and onetime colleague of the astronomer Carl Sagan. Mr. Reiffel developed the tool for a children\u2019s science show he hosted in Chicago. He successfully pitched the technology to the sports and weather departments. Networks in New York took notice, and after the 1982 Super Bowl, CBS ordered four of the devices, Mr. Reiffel said. At first, a pen was used to draw on one of Mr. Reiffel\u2019s handmade, wooden consoles. Today,   tablets are typically used. For his work, the National Academy of Arts and Sciences honored Mr. Reiffel with an Emmy in 2004. His mother coined the name Telestrator, which was slightly catchier than Mr. Reiffel\u2019s description: a \u201csuperimposed dynamic television display system. \u201d _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.
