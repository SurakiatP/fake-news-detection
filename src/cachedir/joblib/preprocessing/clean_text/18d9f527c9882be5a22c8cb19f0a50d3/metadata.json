Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called President Donald Trump\u2019s decision one of his \u201cfinest hours. \u201d  Haley said, \u201cWhat happened this week was really one of the president\u2019s finest hours. \u201d She continued, \u201cHe wanted to know exactly what the facts and evidence was. He wanted to know what the options were, what the risks were, and the political strategy and solution side of it. After all of that, he made a very, you know, strong decision and I think it was one that was very good for the world. \u201d She added, \u201cHe won\u2019t stop here \u201cIf he needs to do more, he\u2019ll do more. Really, now what happens depends on how everyone responds to what happened in Syria and make sure that we start moving toward a political solution and we start finding peace in that area. \u201d (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561667.346439}
