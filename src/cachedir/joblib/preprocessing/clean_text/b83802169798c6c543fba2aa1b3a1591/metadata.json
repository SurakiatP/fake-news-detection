[Trump has stated that he does not intend to target   \u201cDreamers\u201d  \u2014   illegal aliens who entered the United States as minors  \u2014   and may allow them to stay and work in the country legally.  But according to a report in the Los Angeles Times, senior Trump aides and two immigration policy advisers have examined at least two options for ending DACA that would not directly involve Trump. One of the options is a legal guide that provides detailed information about which people are priorities for deportation. The Times writes, \u201cUnder that option, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, a vocal critic of deportation relief as a senator, would direct Department of Justice lawyers to review the program, which issues   work permits to people who qualify and keeps them from being categorized as deportation priorities. \u201d After that, if the Department of Justice (DOJ) determines that DACA is illegal, they would reportedly instruct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to stop providing and renewing those work permits. A second option would involve the courts. The Times writes, \u201cA handful of governors are considering a challenge patterned on the 2014 lawsuit filed by several conservative state officials against the Obama administration\u2019s expansion of deportation protections. If they sue, Sessions could instruct his lawyers not to defend the program in court, exposing it to indefinite suspension by a federal judge. \u201d During Thursday\u2019s press conference, President Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna show great heart. DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. \u201d He added, \u201cTo me, it\u2019s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids. \u201d Trump said, \u201cI love these kids. I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough. \u201d Last week, approximately 680 illegal immigrants were swept up for repatriation as part of a crackdown on criminal illegal aliens living in the United States 161 of them were arrested throughout Southern California. A February 13 statement from the Department of Homeland Security indicated that 75 percent of the 680 illegal immigrants who were taken in by authorities had committed crimes inside the United States. The Times notes that as these options are being worked out, work permits are still being issued. Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz'"}, "time": 1742563664.4929185}
