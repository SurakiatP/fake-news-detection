Here is a look at the new lineup. Araminta Ross, known as \u201cMinty,\u201d was born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of Maryland around 1822. When she was about 26, and married to John Tubman, she escaped to Philadelphia and took her mother\u2019s given name, Harriet. She later returned to rescue family members, and was asked by slaves not related to her to help them escape as well. She took great risks traveling at night from the South to the free North via a network of secret routes and safe houses on the Underground Railroad. When the Civil War began, Tubman became a spy for the Union. _____ Susan B. Anthony was born in 1820 to a Quaker family in Massachusetts and became an antislavery activist as a teenager. With Elizabeth Cady Stanton, she founded and led several women\u2019s groups and suffrage organizations and played a central role in pressing for what would become the 19th Amendment granting women\u2019s suffrage. In 1872 she was arrested on charges of voting in her hometown, Rochester, convicted and ordered to pay a fine. Six years later, she and Stanton presented Congress with an amendment giving women the right to vote. She died in 1906, 14 years before it was ratified. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, born in 1815, was a pioneer of the women\u2019s rights movement who played a central role in the drive for women\u2019s suffrage. In 1848 at Seneca Falls, N. Y, she presented the \u201cDeclaration of Sentiments\u201d that echoed the language of the Declaration of Independence. But Stanton\u2019s version, signed by 68 women and 32 men, denounced the \u201clong train of abuses\u201d inflicted by men on women. \u201cSuch has been the patient sufferance of the women under this government, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are entitled,\u201d Stanton wrote. Lucretia Coffin Mott, born in 1793, was a Quaker who devoted herself to abolitionist and women\u2019s causes. She played a key role in organizing the Seneca Falls convention and producing the \u201cDeclaration of Sentiments\u201d that called for women\u2019s equality. But she was stunned by Stanton\u2019s call at the convention for women to be allowed to vote. \u201cOh Lizzie, if thee demands that, thee will make us ridiculous!\u201d Mott protested. But she remained a central player in both the antislavery and women\u2019s suffrage movement. Alice Paul, a Quaker born in 1885 who was taken to women\u2019s suffrage meetings as a teenager, founded the National Women\u2019s Party in 1916. She organized protests for suffrage in front of the White House, many of them resulting in beatings by the police. The effort led to the 19th Amendment. Paul, who had a Ph. D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania, established a headquarters for the Women\u2019s Party in a house near the Capitol, which President Obama has designated as the   Women\u2019s Equality National Monument. Mr. Obama has called her \u201ca brilliant community organizer and political strategist. \u2019\u2019 Isabella Baumfree  \u2014   a   slave born in 1797 in rural New York  \u2014   changed her name to Sojourner Truth after she walked off an upstate farm in 1826 with her infant daughter. She became a Christian preacher and grew increasingly political in pressing for abolition, women\u2019s suffrage and prison reform. She delivered her most famous address, \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman,\u2019\u2019 in 1851 in Ohio, where she said: \u201cI could work as much and eat as much as a man  \u2014   when I could get it  \u2014   and bear the lash as well. And ain\u2019t I a woman? \u2019\u2019 _____ Marian Anderson, a coal seller\u2019s daughter, was born in 1897 and had become one of the world\u2019s most accomplished contraltos by 1939, the year the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow her to perform at Constitution Hall because of a \u201cwhite artists only\u201d clause in its contracts. Eleanor Roosevelt, the first lady, resigned from the D. A. R. in protest and encouraged the Interior Department to find a place for Ms. Anderson to perform. The result was an Easter concert at the Lincoln Memorial that drew 75, 000 people, with millions more tuning in on the radio. Eleanor Roosevelt, born in New York City in 1884, was the first lady from 1933 to 1945 and redefined the role. Shortly after arriving at the White House, she held the first news conference by a president\u2019s wife and continually surprised the country with her outspokenness and activism. After the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, she was named a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. She traveled the world as a human rights advocate, lecturer and writer until her death in 1962. Her intervention on behalf of Marian Anderson remains among her   moments. The 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was not the first time the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. uttered the   phrase: \u201cI Have a Dream. \u201d He had said it before in speeches in Detroit and North Carolina, but it did not become a national refrain until the day the Baptist preacher, who became the voice of the civil rights movement, used it before 250, 000 people on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The phrase was part of a broader speech about racial justice and equality, but the four words has endured as one of the most powerful, pivotal moments in American history.'"}, "time": 1742563974.4024277}
