But no one has ever taught a nonhuman primate to say \u201chello. \u201d Scientists have long been intrigued by the failure of primates to talk like us. Understanding the reasons may offer clues to how our own ancestors evolved   speech, one of our most powerful adaptations. On Friday, a team of researchers reported that monkeys have a vocal tract capable of human speech. They argue that other primates can\u2019t talk because they lack the right wiring in their brains. \u201cA monkey\u2019s vocal tract would be perfectly adequate to produce hundreds, thousands of words,\u201d said W. Tecumseh Fitch, a cognitive scientist at the University of Vienna and a   of the new study. Human speech results from a complicated choreography of flowing air and contracting muscles. To make a particular sound, we have to give the vocal tract a particular shape. The vocal tracts of other primates contain the same elements as ours  \u2014   from vocal cords to tongues to lips  \u2014   but their geometry is different. That difference long ago set scientists to debating whether primates could make speechlike sounds. In the 1960s, Philip H. Lieberman, now a professor emeritus of Brown University, and his colleagues went so far as to pack a dead monkey\u2019s vocal tract with plaster to get a   rendering. They used acoustic formulas to determine what sort of sound the tract would produce. Then they tested out variations on that shape, based on how living monkeys open their jaws and move other parts of their vocal tracts. In 1969, the researchers concluded that the range of vowel sounds that monkeys could make was \u201cquite restricted,\u201d compared with those produced by humans. Dr. Lieberman would go on to study chimpanzee vocal tracts and look for clues to speech in the fossils of ancient humans and Neanderthals. He argued that a crucial part of the evolution of speech was a gradual anatomical change to the vocal tract in humans. Crucial to this transition was the human tongue\u2019s descent back into the throat. \u201cIt\u2019s not until about 75, 000 years ago that you find fossils of fully modern humans with a vocal tract like that,\u201d Dr. Lieberman said in an interview. Dr. Fitch, a former student of Dr. Lieberman, and his colleagues came to a much different conclusion after reviewing   videos of macaques. The terse title of their new paper in Science Advances nicely sums up the findings: \u201cMonkey Vocal Tracts Are  . \u201d In collaboration with Asif A. Ghazanfar, a neuroscientist at Princeton, Dr. Fitch filmed three rhesus macaque monkeys with a portable   scanner. The goal was to survey the range of sounds monkeys will make on their own. \u201cWe only wanted them to do their natural capabilities,\u201d said Dr. Ghazanfar. When the scientists brought another monkey into the room, for example, the animals would smack their lips. The scientists could get the monkeys to coo and grunt when presented with fruit. As they ate the fruit, the videos showed, the monkeys moved their mouths and throats into alternate positions. The scientists selected 99 stills from their   videos to study in more detail. They mapped the outline of the vocal tract in each picture, and then generated a   computer rendering of it, which they then used to model the sounds that a monkey could make by pushing air through that space. In theory, the researchers concluded, monkeys can make a fairly wide range of sounds. Looking at the most distinct vocal tract shapes, Dr. Fitch and Dr. Ghazanfar identified five separate vowels among the possibilities. \u201cWhat you get are the vowels in \u2018bit,\u2019 \u2018bet,\u2019 \u2018bat,\u2019 \u2018but\u2019 and \u2018bought,\u2019\u201d Dr. Fitch said. When the researchers played these sounds to people, they were able to correctly distinguish them most of the time. The scientists could even assemble the sounds into recognizable sentences. So what prevents these monkeys from gabbing all day long by the watering hole? The two researchers argue that the key to the acquisition of speech lies somewhere in the brain. \u201cIf they had the brain, they could produce intelligible speech,\u201d Dr. Ghazanfar said. Our ancestors may have evolved special brain circuits that allowed them to learn new sounds as babies. Humans also developed a special set of nerves for the fine motor control of their vocal tracts. Dr. Lieberman isn\u2019t convinced: His view is still that the evolution of human speech had to involve changes in both the brain and the vocal tract. Monkeys in the new study, he noted, failed to make the most distinct sounds in human speech, such as a long e. Without such a full repertoire of distinct sounds, he argues, it\u2019s not possible to speak clearly as we do. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between having a very saturated color and a very pastel color,\u201d he said. The acoustic version of saturated colors would have been important for   human speech, he said. But Anna Barney, a speech scientist at the University of Southampton in England, found the research of Dr. Fitch and his colleagues more persuasive. While monkeys may not have the full range of human vowels, Dr. Barney said, their repertoire is a very good starting place for speech. Still, she cautioned that the new study left important questions about speech unresolved. Vowels are important to speech, for example, but so are consonants. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve shown is that monkeys are   not \u201d Dr. Barney said.'"}, "time": 1742628475.6088452}
