lev long history application we foreign policy promote intervention war exclude bad evil ingrained aspect realpolitik become us political psyche become axiomatic we public polity conduct government recently promote noam chomsky uncharacteristically weak argument exhort left us vote hillary clinton chomsky wrong political philosophy underpin lev prevail result widespread acceptance us political establishment argument exhibit many blind assumption make concern lev principal area lev cite we foreign policy casual glance operation give sense problem ethical system vietnam afghanistan iraq libya subject horrific bombing invasion military degradation successive us government basis represent lev today even we benefit hindsight would concur application us foreign policy sphere lev support sound ethical principle indeed many outside us would regard support lev evil clearly motivation us invasion lev consideration least geopolitical motive adherence lev enable successive us govts conduct programme widespread military aggression would otherwise mean justify come primary mean justify brutality rampant we successive president subscribe wholeheartedly disastrous consequence world certainly lev persuasive argument government face complex issue situation domestically abroad fraught difficulty clear example sound application lev could consider institution police force police force restrain liberty benefit without would degree lawlessness compatible functioning civilised society may thus say police force lev loss liberty evil incur avoid lawlessness great evil bring we crux matter lev seem reasonable application option apply situation option run difficulty case police apparent third way least noone yet find one lev therefore safely apply instance situation knifewielde madman approach group school child disable run vehicle see appropriate application lev seem third way thus great evil may avoid opt less evil possible prevent knifeman say shut school gate would remove act run lev principle would possibility policeman taser device observe approach would possession number option would complex moral decision lev would unhelpful possibly harmful remedy would seek apply simple response complex problem would potentially detrimental may result poor moral choice make scale case conflict us another country arise myriad option available virtue lev good moral principle apply situation recent example country attack us past year never eitheror situation indeed situation subject widespread argument protest concern option fact lev use justify war bombing intervention etc testament misapplication rather wrongness principle per se give complexity international relation probably safe regard lev unlikely applicable issue also severe problem lev application public sphere aside practical consideration suggest evil right less evil unwittingly endorse principle end justify mean principle central western ethical thinking least year deeply flawed unsurprisingly use many dictator means justify act however bad provide ultimate outcome good outcome may judge good circumstance measure timescale many criticism notion consequentialism seem wrong intuitively finite human accept indeterminate version consequentialism ethical decision make must applicability timescale consequence need also measure act intention well consequence well balanced sound ethical principle place matter ethical value act consequence alone intention effectively remove act judge entirely outcome hard imagine malign circumstance work well chance example judge bank robbery go awry inadvertent consequence uncover stash terrorist weapon bank vault may pleased discover plot would hardly likely applaud robber seem consequence must least intend seem reasonable argue end moral act sole measure value course also practical difficulty time outcome many act weigh act long much practical use case must rely heavily intention lev involve another major problem option consist evil consequence could justifiable select one basis choice choice available may argue least evil choice ethical option although introduction third element would cause exponential difficulty would introduce consideration expediency practicality judgement concern relative likelihood successful outcome lev apply multiple choice complex situation involve moral decision therefore crass inappropriate response situation since simplifie deliberately exclude possible solution advertisement lev also require heavy qualification frequently use excuse justify evil rather consider option thus sense unethical principle inappropriately apply lev must apply dire exigency nature exigency urgent action would hardly necessary also careful ensure situation properly identify lev situation take situation lifeboat room one passenger apart old man water child save must drown certainly evil present prima facie lev situation close examination see undoubtedly option available may give place

great certainly assume great impact lev take application public sphere large number people affect bring we use lev democratic election prove dubious application use foreign affair representative democracy dependent notion freedom choice good candidate may elect anything inhibit undermine principle lev nature rather promote contest good free manner possible promote least bad option narrow choice constrain distort freedom choice voter denial democratic principle apply choice available distortion become even great may justly inquire whether limited form democracy possess representative form worthy name democracy also consider democratic election require myriad assumption judgement make therefore susceptible evil less evil consideration furthermore b ecause ethical value mean clear invest simply one candidate another judgement make complex deserving treatment noam chomsky john halle argue lev use us presidential election argument worthy examination chomsky provide general caveat way provide softlanding assumption lev deeply flawed first argument clinton foreign policy may bad trump advance claim follow logic seem require vote trump astonishing nonsequitur make requirment use simply means eviscerate claim clinton lev respect without lead endorsement trump wide aspect may equally contribute decision abstain vote vote rd party second refer politic moral witness argument lev remain evil engage counter state point voting lev less evil obvious rejoinder perhaps may seem circulus demonstrandum type fallacy make criticism seem right someone already sign notion lev other simply evince premise proof seek confirm thirdly chomsky go state basic moral principle stake simple must take responsibility action consequence action other important consideration feel good first proposition good second half stray purpose somewhat appear part try lessen effect personal responsibility state consequence regard important intention dangerous argument even common sense level intention give great value human relation often detriment consequence right see consequence nature often unpredictable involve many assumption prejudice involve many matter always relevant decision bomb iraq lead safe world rid we people evil regime purposely introduce contentious familiar issue play like intention good introduce assumption involve great leap faith logic ie consequence bomb bad produce safe world good justifie action see easily argument go awry practical recent application human history safe justifiable take argument beyond remit view intention alone decision may see good bad depend one point view consequence alone death many innocent people destruction nation infrastructure clearly evil imply outcome war good war would good one seem intention must play heavily judgement proper balance must observe intention consequence judge action especially could possibly know outcome course set aside notion iraq true lev situation since action could take considerably less evil example serve demonstrate intention consequence easily separate weigh ethical value action therefore seem fair alter chomskys proposition must take responsibility action intrinsic good basis consider consequence corollary far ethical argument take we advertisement final criticism lev say chomsky equate passive acquiescence bipartisan status quo attack state lev defend fact poorly consider electoral decision impose cost go give subjective example nixon continuation vietnam war unjustifiable measure consider apply assumption prejudice previous argument quite easily argue alternative nixon might produce different adminsitration indeed might produce alternative end vietnam war might recent us history overfill instance different electoral result produce different policy case vietnam argue war war us establishment surely noone prosecute war great vigour determination democrat president lbj difficulty example move realm pure speculation guess alternative might could equally claim
