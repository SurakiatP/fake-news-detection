Trump is closing in on victory, announced Wednesday that Carly Fiorina would be his running mate if he won the Republican nomination. The move, a day after Mr. Trump scored unexpectedly wide victory margins in sweeping five East Coast states, amounted to the grandest diversionary tactic a presidential candidate can stage  \u2014   or at least the grandest one available to a candidate trailing by about  400 delegates who failed to win more than 25 percent of the vote in any state on Tuesday. Taking the stage after 4 p. m. before a modest but spirited crowd in a cavernous pavilion here, Mr. Cruz described Mrs. Fiorina, the former presidential candidate and   chief executive, as \u201cbrilliant and capable\u201d and deeply principled, and praised her for having \u201cshattered glass ceilings. \u201d Mr. Cruz\u2019s criteria for a pick, in his telling, seemed to be aimed squarely at Mr. Trump. \u201cDo they think through decisions in a rash and impulsive way?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo they pop off the handle at whatever strikes them at any given moment?\u201d He held up Mrs. Fiorina as someone who knows \u201cwhere jobs come from. \u201d \u201cBorn in Texas,\u201d he added, grinning, \u201cthe very first thing I liked about her. \u201d Mr. Cruz\u2019s decision to rush out a   pick before next week\u2019s primary in Indiana, which is becoming    for his candidacy, was the political equivalent of a student pulling a fire alarm to avoid an exam: It was certain to draw attention and carried the possibility of meeting its immediate goal, but seemed unlikely to forestall the eventual reckoning. Still, for Mr. Cruz, it could serve to shift the focus away from Mr. Trump\u2019s success and from his own wheezing alliance with Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who agreed to clear out of Indiana if Mr. Cruz withdrew from competition in Oregon and New Mexico. And since endorsing Mr. Cruz last month, Mrs. Fiorina has proved to be an eager surrogate, attacking both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton with zeal. On Wednesday, Mrs. Fiorina quickly seized on the role of faithful sidekick, singing a song to Mr. Cruz\u2019s daughters from the stage, appraising the senator as \u201ca lot of fun\u201d and repeatedly hammering home the Cruz campaign argument that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are essentially indistinguishable on policy. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to challenge the system,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are the system. \u201d Mr. Cruz\u2019s announcement was prompted by the same countervailing forces that pushed him to strike the nonaggression pact with Mr. Kasich on Sunday: Mr. Cruz\u2019s polling in Indiana showed him down   in Indiana last week, according to two Republicans familiar with the findings. He has edged closer to Mr. Trump in nightly surveys this week, but remains behind. \u201cIf the election were held today, we\u2019d lose but not get crushed,\u201d said a Republican familiar with Mr. Cruz\u2019s polling. What is striking, though, is that Mr. Cruz decided to tap Mrs. Fiorina even after his own surveys indicated she would offer only a modest boost. In Indiana and subsequent states, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign tested the impact if Mr. Cruz named Mrs. Fiorina as his running mate and found it was only worth \u201ca couple of points,\u201d said a Republican briefed on the polling results. \u201cVoters like her. They don\u2019t love her,\u201d said this Republican, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the  . Yet Mr. Cruz\u2019s gambit may present a perilous challenge for Mr. Trump, who faces mounting criticism for his derisive remarks about women, including his repeated claims that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sole political asset is \u201cthe woman\u2019s card. \u201d Already viewed unfavorably by a majority of women in general election polls, Mr. Trump has clashed savagely with Mrs. Fiorina in the past. He has mocked her business record, her voice and even her looks. \u201cLook at that face,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine last summer. \u201cWould anyone vote for that?\u201d Another slashing comment directed at Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s appearance or gender could have grave consequences for Mr. Trump, especially with female voters he would need to win over to compete in the fall. Current and former advisers to Mr. Trump said he has long found Mrs. Fiorina an agitating presence and described her in public and private as an unworthy opponent with dubious business credentials. And Mr. Trump has repeatedly disregarded advisers who urged him steer clear of conflict with a comparatively obscure rival, no matter how fervent his distaste for her. Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who was dismissed from the campaign last summer, said Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers warned him that his treatment of Mrs. Fiorina would be perceived as a test of his discipline for the general election. \u201cWe had already anticipated that there would be attacks of sexism, that there would be attacks that you don\u2019t respect women,\u201d said Mr. Nunberg, who now opposes Mr. Trump, paraphrasing the Trump campaign\u2019s counsel to the candidate. \u201cThis was a major test to show you can compete as a presidential candidate. \u201d Mr. Nunberg added, \u201cUnfortunately, Donald failed that test miserably. \u201d For Mr. Cruz, the drawbacks to naming Mrs. Fiorina are many: A pick designed to change momentum in a primary could prove less than optimal for a general election. Voters might find it presumptuous for a candidate to name his prospective running mate while trailing by several hundred delegates. Then there are the taunts from Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s wasting his time,\u201d the   told reporters Tuesday night, when asked about Mr. Cruz\u2019s preparations for a possible selection. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded dismissively to reports of a   ticket: On Twitter he posted a clip of Mrs. Fiorina on television, earlier in the campaign, calling Mr. Cruz a politician who \u201csays whatever he needs to say to get elected. \u201d (A \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Kasich circulated a memo listing Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s past criticisms of Mr. Cruz in greater detail.) For those inclined to cast Mr. Cruz\u2019s   Senate tenure as a triumph of principle, the selection and its unusual timing could register as the kind of unconventional move of a Republican who has made a career of bucking the party\u2019s establishment. But among Republicans in Washington, where skirmishes with Mr. Cruz have focused more often on tactics than policy substance, the maneuver appeared likely to reinforce the perception among his detractors that he is cynical and calculating. Either way, in Mrs. Fiorina, Mr. Cruz has turned to a credible outsider and an expert attack dog who has sparred often with the senator\u2019s rivals in both parties. She will surely be deployed in California, where the June 7 primary could determine whether Mr. Trump captures the delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the convention. Mrs. Fiorina has statewide political experience there, having been the Republican nominee against Senator Barbara Boxer in 2010. Her connections with the sort of party activists likely to vote in the primary there could give Mr. Cruz a valuable surrogate in the weeks leading up to it. She did, however, lose her one California campaign by 10 points and has since left the state to live in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. Mindful of the gender gap often evident in Mr. Trump\u2019s polling, Cruz allies hope that Mrs. Fiorina will prove a capable foil to him, as she did while besting him in a series of debate exchanges during her own candidacy. In recent weeks, she has again relished the role, disparaging Mr. Trump in interviews and urging him to \u201cman up\u201d and debate Mr. Cruz   . She has also shown a habit of answering questions addressed to Mr. Cruz at news conferences, interjecting to sing his praises or defend his actions. In the past, though, Mrs. Fiorina has chafed at being described as   material. Last year, she called it \u201csexist\u201d that she was often asked whether she was running for president in the hopes of being chosen as someone\u2019s running mate. More recently, she had hedged when asked about her interest. As Mrs. Fiorina sat beside Mr. Cruz for a Fox News interview last month, the Texas senator was asked whether he would consider Mrs. Fiorina for the role. A live audience cheered, and Mrs. Fiorina answered before Mr. Cruz could. \u201cLet\u2019s win the nomination first,\u201d she said. Mr. Cruz\u2019s selection of Mrs. Fiorina was also reminiscent of a candidate whom he revered. In his 1976 primary against President Gerald R. Ford, Ronald Reagan  \u2014   lagging and needing to change the subject  \u2014   announced his choice of a running mate before the Republican convention. The gamble paid off in the short term. His selection of Senator Richard S. Schweiker of Pennsylvania led the evening news, slowed the news media\u2019s rush to declare Ford the presumptive nominee and allowed Reagan to continue wooing delegates. But Reagan\u2019s announcement came after the primaries had ended, not with 10 states remaining, and he was closer behind Ford in the delegate count than Mr. Cruz is today to Mr. Trump. Mr. Schweiker carried the promise of winning over a clear constituency, the Pennsylvania delegation, while it is unclear which voters Mrs. Fiorina could deliver. And Reagan still lost to Ford.'"}, "time": 1742563068.451288}
