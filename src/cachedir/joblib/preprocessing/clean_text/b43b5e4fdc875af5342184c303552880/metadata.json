I envision the audience to be that ocean of white folk I encounter who are deeply empathetic to the struggles of minorities  \u2014   they are the ones who ask me, \u201cWhat can I do, as a white person?\u201d This is my attempt to address them in the most useful and, hopefully, edifying manner. What\u2019s your strategy for getting through to the white people who may not be particularly sympathetic? What I\u2019ve seen under the wonderful presidency of Barack Obama is the tendency to not tell white people the truth, for obvious reasons  \u2014   they don\u2019t vote for you. But I\u2019m not a politician. I don\u2019t have that power or influence, but what I do wield is a different kind of bully pulpit. We have to have enough belief in white people to tell them the truth. They are grown! There are a lot of areas within race relations that seem like less of a conversation and more of an attempt to prove to white people that these issues  \u2014   police brutality, for instance  \u2014   are a real and present danger. I open this book with horror stories about my engagement with the police. These are the stories that have shaped me, that join me to the mass of people who, regardless of our station in life, regardless of educational attainment and achievement, have felt this. The president of the United States has these stories, the former attorney general has these stories and a prominent black intellectual like me has these stories. The reality is that this is part and parcel of what it means to be black in America, and I wanted to spend time talking and thinking about it from a number of different perspectives to show white brothers and sisters that we aren\u2019t making this up. This is not fabricated. I can\u2019t help but think that if the same levels of police brutality were happening to white people, we would just disband the police. Police brutality would not be seen as the price of keeping our society safe. Recently, I was outside of Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl in Washington at 3 a. m. and a young white kid is cursing the police, and I\u2019m going, \u201cOh, my God, they\u2019re going to shoot him. \u201d And then it occurred to me that they wouldn\u2019t  \u2014   he\u2019s a white kid. And what did I hear the police say? \u201cNow, son, you\u2019re clearly inebriated. You need to go home and sleep this off. \u201d And I said to myself: \u201cMy God! This is what we want!\u201d We can\u2019t even afford a display of anger that many white people have. At the end of your sermon, you do a \u201cbenediction\u201d section, in which you talk about making reparations on the local and individual level: donating to groups like the United Negro College Fund or a scholarship program, but also, to cite your example from the book, paying \u201cthe black person who cuts your grass double what you might ordinarily pay. \u201d That gave me pause! Good! I used to say in church, \u201cIf the sermon ain\u2019t making you a little bit uncomfortable, it ain\u2019t effective. \u201d Look, if it doesn\u2019t cost you anything, you\u2019re not really engaging in change you\u2019re engaging in convenience. You\u2019re engaged in the overflow. I\u2019m asking you to do stuff you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do. I\u2019m asking you to think more seriously and strategically about why you possess what you possess. I agree with reparations, but maybe this is my white privilege speaking: I can\u2019t imagine actually doing that. That is what I meant by an I. R. A.: an individual reparations account. You ain\u2019t got to ask the government, you don\u2019t have to ask your local politician  \u2014   this is what you, an individual, conscientious, \u201cwoke\u201d citizen can do. But charity can\u2019t be the end of it, right? The Koch brothers gave the United Negro College Fund $25 million, but I doubt you would consider them \u201cwoke. \u201d No. Martin Luther King Jr. believed that charity is a poor substitute for justice. But I ain\u2019t turning $25 million down.'"}, "time": 1742564161.6597326}
