He was 84. David Staller, a longtime friend, confirmed the death. For the last 23 years, the   Mr. Osborne brought a sophisticated, gentlemanly air to TCM, where he turned his   familiarity with films, their back stories and their stars into absorbing intros, outros and interviews. He typically introduced 18 movies a week, as well as marathons and special presentations, that provided an escape into a golden age when Fred and Ginger were dancing, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman ruled and Marlon Brando was transforming acting. And, it turned out, his presence and storytelling helped turn TCM into a prime destination for movie buffs. \u201cI get stopped on the street all the time,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2014. \u201cPeople say: \u2018You got me through cancer last year. You got me past unemployment. You take me away from my troubles.\u2019 Exactly what movies did in the \u201930s and \u201940s. \u201d Mr. Osborne appealed as much to moviemakers as he did to moviegoers. In a statement, Steven Spielberg said, \u201cHe got us excited and reawakened to the greatest stories ever told with the most charismatic stars in the world. \u201d Mr. Osborne was a fan and historian with a special fondness for leading ladies like Olivia de Havilland, Gene Tierney, Kim Novak, Barbara Stanwyck and Bette Davis, some of whom became his friends. \u201cI love those people,\u201d he told \u201cCBS Sunday Morning\u201d last year. \u201cThey were so interesting to be around. These were people that once ruled the world. \u201d Ben Mankiewicz, another host on TCM, said he had witnessed the affection that actresses like Debbie Reynolds, Eva Marie Saint, Cher and Liza Minnelli showed Mr. Osborne. \u201cThere was a trust between them,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou spend 20 seconds with Robert, you know you could trust him. They knew that he appreciated the legacy they were part of. They could let their guard down. He was the exact right caretaker of these movies that mean so much to so many people. \u201d But, Mr. Mankiewicz added, \u201cHe\u2019d talk to you as much about Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power and Cary Grant. \u201d In his West Side apartment at  \u2014   yes, the Osborne  \u2014   he kept a memorabilia collection that included a   pincushion from one of Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s birthday parties ashtrays from show business landmarks like the Brown Derby in Hollywood and the Stork Club in New York two Golden Globe awards and the  statuette used in the awards ceremony scene in \u201cAll About Eve,\u201d which Ms. Davis gave him as a gift. Robert Jolin Osborne Jr. was born on May 3, 1932, in Colfax, Wash. His father was a high school principal and coach his mother, the former Hazel Jolin, was a homemaker. Robert discovered his love of Hollywood when, in 1941, his mother brought him a copy of Modern Screen magazine with Lana Turner on the cover. He became so engrossed that he began jotting down, in a notebook, the details of every   movie he could find  \u2014   a kind of human precursor to the Internet Movie Database. His love of movies led to his working as a young man at the Rose and Roxy Theaters in Colfax. (He later invested in another Rose Theater, in Port Townsend, Wash. which was renovated in the 1990s.) He studied journalism at the University of Washington and started acting after graduation, working for 20th Century Fox and for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\u2019s Desilu Productions. His screen credits were modest: uncredited roles (one in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho\u201d) and a guest appearance on the 1960s sitcom \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies. \u201d Ms. Ball liked him and encouraged him to give up acting to write about Hollywood. And former stars in particular  \u2014   untethered from the studio system, rarely working and often forgotten  \u2014   welcomed him. \u201cThey were cut off like people on a desert island,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cPaulette Goddard, I got to know. Hedy Lamarr, I got to know really well. Nobody gave a damn about Hedy Lamarr back then. \u201d His book, \u201cAcademy Awards Illustrated\u201d (1965) with an introduction by Ms. Davis, led to his becoming a critic and columnist at The Hollywood Reporter. His television appearances led to his being hired as a host on The Movie Channel before he moved to TCM in 1994. Mr. Osborne\u2019s love of movies led him to invest in the Rose Theater in Port Townsend and he became instrumental in the growth of its film festival, now entering its 18th year. \u201cWith his connections, he brought us Eva Marie Saint and other stars,\u201d said Rocky Friedman, the majority owner of the Rose Theater there. \u201cThey\u2019d come and do interviews with Robert  \u2014   and he was so gracious with the public. \u201d Mr. Osborne left no immediate family survivors. Mr. Friedman said he saw Mr. Osborne last month in Manhattan. \u201cHe was just Robert, with countless stories about Hollywood,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he told me something I had never known. That every Sunday for 40 years, he has spoken to Olivia de Havilland. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563815.1558602}
