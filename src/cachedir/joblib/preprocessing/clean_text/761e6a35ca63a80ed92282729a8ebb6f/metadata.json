So, you know, what is soft is goose for the gander. There is great concern. There has been a blizzard of executive orders and memorandums, some vague, some specific, some probably unlawful. And you have people in the streets here. \u201d \u201cThis president has not brought the nation together as he says he is working for his base,\u201d she continued. \u201cWell, there are a majority of people that are outside of that base. And I think my best advice has been, and I was able to say this to him directly, please, Mr. President, you have to bring this country together. What he is doing is splitting it apart more and more and more. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562150.5625963}
