He is trying to get her to question her sense of reality, to think her mind is playing tricks on her  \u2014   in short, to convince her that she is going slightly crazy, a tactic that can be scarily effective. Trump\u2019s compulsive lies are a   fact of the campaign at this point, but I still questioned my own reality for a moment on Monday night whenever he fudged the truth  \u2014   as when he implied that by saying Hillary Clinton did not have the presidential look, he meant she did not have the \u201cstamina\u201d (this is a lot like his saying that when he insulted Carly Fiorina\u2019s face, he really meant her \u201cpersona\u201d). I\u2019d already seen a clip of him in which he goes after Clinton\u2019s lack of a presidential look, specifically  \u2014   but even so, I had that normal human response, a bit of  . Maybe it was taken out of context? I went back and looked  \u2014   nope, there he is back in September, telling ABC\u2019s David Muir, \u201cI just don\u2019t think she has a presidential look, and you need a presidential look. \u201d Trump tries to gaslight an entire country when he plays fast and loose with the truth or insists on   connections  \u2014   each of which is an apt tactic for someone who often questions the mental health of women who dare to criticize him. If they are women with big careers, like Maureen Dowd, Mika Brzezinski and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, they are \u201cneurotic. \u201d He called the Rev. Faith Green Timmons, a pastor who calmly and boldly interrupted him at her church in Flint, Mich. \u201cnervous,\u201d which is apparently the black woman\u2019s (or   woman\u2019s) version of neurotic. These women are not just wrong, to Trump they are suffering from a kind of mental or medical condition. \u201cIt\u2019s organic, it\u2019s biological,\u201d the feminist writer Elaine Showalter, the author of \u201cHystories: Hysterical Epidemics and Modern Culture,\u201d says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that comes out of their gender  \u2014   like whatever was coming out of Megyn Kelly. \u201d Women, he clearly believes, or wants us to believe, are emotional, guided by feelings rather than reason, which presumably makes them unfit to lead (or unfit to give Trump a hard time). All of this is why it was particularly interesting  \u2014   subversive, even, in a   kind of way  \u2014   to see Clinton say to Trump early in the debate, \u201cDonald, I know you live in your own reality. \u201d She followed that up, not much later, with a laugh that led into: \u201cJust join the debate by saying more crazy things. \u201d She seemed to hesitate before speaking that line it sounded about as spontaneous as her apparent new catchphrase \u201c   . \u201d Planned or not, \u201ccrazy\u201d was a clear provocation  \u2014   it told us exactly how we were supposed to feel about the things Trump was saying. And it did something else. As anyone who has ever been gaslit knows, nothing drives a person more crazy than being told he  \u2014   or usually she  \u2014   is crazy. Trump performed as anticipated  \u2014   you might even argue that the \u201ccrazy\u201d line was a turning point in the debate. Soon after that, the lights started flickering. His already shaky syntax fell apart we had \u201ca fed doing political things\u201d labored digressions about how often he is audited, and how little he minds it mentions of a \u201cbig fat ugly bubble\u201d and a \u201cvery   judge. \u201d Trump was leaning into the lectern, his face coloring and contorting even his sniffing seemed to pick up, not so much flulike as ticlike. What I would have given for Clinton to offer him a tissue. \u201cTrump did one great thing,\u201d the humor writer Paul Rudnick tweeted on Monday night. \u201cHe proved that men are overemotional, petty and silly creatures. \u201d Clinton came on stage dressed in a red flag she baited Trump, and he charged. Who had the more presidential look? The matador  \u2014   or the bull? They say the camera never lies.'"}, "time": 1742628305.0239906}
