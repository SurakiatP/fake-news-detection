[The New York Times wore out its thesaurus denouncing the order: \u201ccruelty   \u2026     injury   \u2026     suffering   \u2026     bigoted, cowardly,     \u2026     breathtaking   \u2026     inflammatory   \u2026     callousness and indifference\u201d  \u2014   and that\u2019s from a single editorial!  Amid the hysteria over this prudent pause in refugee admissions from seven countries whose principal export is dynamite vests, it has been indignantly claimed that it\u2019s illegal for our immigration policies to discriminate on the basis of religion. This is often said by journalists who are only in America because of immigration policies that discriminated on the basis of religion. For much of the last   Soviet Jews were given nearly automatic entry to the U. S. as \u201crefugees. \u201d Entering as a refugee confers all sorts of benefits unavailable to other immigrants, including loads of welfare programs, health insurance, job placement services, English language classes, and the opportunity to apply for U. S. citizenship after only five years. Most important, though, Soviet Jews were not required to satisfy the United Nations definition of a \u201crefugee,\u201d to wit: someone fleeing persecution based on race, religion or national origin. They just had to prove they were Jewish. This may have been good policy, but let\u2019s not pretend the Jewish exception was not based on religion. If a temporary pause on refugee admissions from seven   countries constitutes \u201ctargeting\u201d Muslims, then our immigration policy \u201ctargeted\u201d Christians for discrimination for about 30 years. Never heard a peep from the ACLU about religious discrimination back then! According to the considered opinion of the Cato Institute\u2019s David J. Bier, writing in the New York Times, Trump\u2019s executive order is \u201cillegal\u201d because the 1965 immigration act \u201cbanned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin. \u201d In 1966, one year after the 1965 immigration act, immigrants from Cuba suddenly got special immigration privileges. In 1986, immigrants from Ireland did. People from Vietnam and Indochina got special immigration rights for 20 years after the end of the Vietnam War. The 1965 law, quite obviously, did not prohibit discrimination based on national origin. (I was wondering why the Times would sully its pages with the legal opinion of a Grove City College B. A. like Bier! Any \u201cexpert\u201d in a storm, I guess.) In fact, ethnic discrimination is practically the hallmark of America\u2019s immigration policy  \u2014   in addition to our perverse obsession with admitting the entire Third World. Commenting on these ethnic boondoggles back in 1996, Sen. Orrin Hatch said: \u201cWe have made a mockery\u201d of refugee law, \u201cbecause of politics and pressure. \u201d We let in one ethnic group out of compassion, then they form an ethnic power bloc to demand that all their fellow countrymen be let in, too. As the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, described \u201cdiversity\u201d in Der Spiegel: \u201cIn multiracial societies, you don\u2019t vote in accordance with your economic interests and social interests, you vote in accordance with race and religion. \u201d That\u2019s our immigration policy  \u2014   plus a healthy dose of Emma Lazarus\u2019 insane idea that all countries of the world should send their losers to us. (Thanks, Emma!) Americans are weary of taking in these pricey Third World immigrants, who show their gratitude by periodically erupting in maniacal violence  \u2014   in, for example, San Bernardino, Orlando, New York City, Fort Hood, Boston, Chattanooga, Bowling Green and St. Cloud. The Muslim immigrants currently being showcased by the left are not likely to change any minds. The Times could produce only 11 cases of temporarily blocked immigrants that the newspaper would even dare mention. (Imagine what the others are like!) For purposes of argument, I will accept the Times\u2019 glowing descriptions of these Muslim immigrants as brilliant scientists on the verge of curing cancer. (Two of the Times\u2019 11 cases actually involved cancer researchers.) Point one: If the Times thinks that brilliance is a desirable characteristic in an immigrant, why can\u2019t we demand that of all our immigrants? To the contrary! Our immigration policy is more likely to turn away the brilliant scientist  \u2014   in order to make room for an Afghani goat herder, whose kid runs a coffee stand until deciding to bomb the New York City subway one day. (That was Najibullah Zazi, my featured \u201cImmigrant of the Week,\u201d on May 1, 2012.) Point two: I happened to notice that even the stellar Muslim immigrants dug up by the Times seem to bring a lot of elderly and sickly relatives with them. Guess who gets to support them? House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s driving obsession (besides being the Koch brothers\u2019 lickspittle) is \u201centitlement reform,\u201d i. e. cutting benefits or raising the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare. I have another idea. How about we stop bringing in immigrants who immediately access government programs, who bring in elderly parents who immediately access government programs, or who run vast criminal enterprises, stealing millions of dollars from government programs? (I illustrated the popularity of government scams with immigrants in Adios, America! by culling all the news stories about these crimes over a   period and listing the perps\u2019 names.) Point three: Contrary to emotional blather about the horrors refugees are fleeing, a lot are just coming to visit their kids or to get free health care. One of the Times\u2019 baby seals  \u2014   an Iraqi with diabetes and \u201ca respiratory ailment\u201d  \u2014   was returning from performing his responsibilities as an elected official in Kirkuk. That\u2019s not exactly fleeing the Holocaust. While it\u2019s fantastic news that most Muslim refugees aren\u2019t terrorists, the downside is: They\u2019re not refugees, they\u2019re not brilliant, they don\u2019t have a constitutional right to come here, and they\u2019re very, very expensive. Until politicians can give us more government services for less money, they need to stop bringing in the poor of the world on our dime.'"}, "time": 1742562481.909682}
