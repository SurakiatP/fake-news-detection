Asylum seekers aged under 18 at the time they were sent to Nauru or Manus Island would be exempt. \\nThe minister would also have power to lift the bar if they believe it\u2019s in the public interest for someone to be allowed in to Australia. \\nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton described the plan as one of the government\u2019s strongest moves, building on the success of its border protection policies over the past three years. \\nIt sent a clear message that Australia was not an option. \\n\u201cThere are still people, advocates in Australia and elsewhere, who are messaging to people on Nauru and Manus, that at some stage you\u2019ll come to Australia,\u201d Mr Dutton said. \\n\u201cThose people are living in false hope and it cannot continue.\u201d The legislation would reflect the coalition\u2019s long-standing policy and what it understood to be Labor\u2019s position, Mr Turnbull said. \\nHe expects the opposition will give \u201cunequivocal support\u201d to the move. \\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop earlier this morning said the government would enshrine in law what had been a longstanding policy. \\n\u201cThis is a tough message we are sending to the people smuggling syndicates and those who pay people smugglers to try and enter Australia,\u201d she told ABC TV. \\n\u201cWe are sending a strong message to those currently in Manus and Nauru, if they are found to be owed protection, they will not be resettled in Australia. If they\u2019re not found to be owed protection, they should return home.\u201d \\nThis would even apply to accepted refugees later attempting to visit via tourist visa, she said. \\n\u201cI will never forget 1200 people that we know of drowned at sea coming to Australia under these people smuggling networks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot have situations where people are drowning at sea and that is why we are working through the case load, the cohort of people who are on Manus and Nauru, to find third country resettlements for them and if they want to stay in PNG and in Nauru, they can be resettled there.\u201d \\nMr Turnbull expects Labor and its leader Bill Shorten will support the laws, saying they are \u201centirely consistent with his party\u2019s stated public position\u201d. \\nMr Dutton added Australia has \u2018discussions ongoing with a number of countries\u2019 on the issue of resettling the asylum seekers already at Naru and Manus. \\nDeputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek said it was too soon to determine if Labor would support the bill. \\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d say is it\u2019s a distraction from Peter Dutton\u2019s hopeless mismanagement of his portfolio,\u201d she told reporters on the Gold Coast. \\n\u201cIt is extraordinary that, three years on, the government has not found third countries to resettle those people who are in limbo on Manus Island and Nauru.\u201d She said Mr Dutton needed to find a permanent resettlement option for these people left in limbo.'"}, "time": 1742562235.8871758}
