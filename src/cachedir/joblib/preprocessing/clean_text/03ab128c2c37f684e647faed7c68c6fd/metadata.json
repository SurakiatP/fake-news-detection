The Canadian dollar experienced wild swings on the back of comments from the Bank of Canada and Governor Poloz. \\nLast Wednesday the Canadian dollar rallied after the Bank of Canada referenced downside risks to inflation and then barely an hour later the Loonie plummeted when Governor Poloz said the committee \u201cactively\u201d considered cutting rates. \\nThen on Monday we saw a similar dynamic play out when Poloz said \u201cthe best plan right now, we think, is to wait for the next 18 months or so,\u201d in a testimony to the House of Commons. The Loonie strengthened significantly on the comment only to completely reverse when Poloz said the comment referred to the output gap and note monetary policy. \\nThe lack of consistency in the Bank of Canada\u2019s communication is creating volatility in asset markets and it can be seen in the USDCAD, see below.'"}, "time": 1742628398.2145305}
