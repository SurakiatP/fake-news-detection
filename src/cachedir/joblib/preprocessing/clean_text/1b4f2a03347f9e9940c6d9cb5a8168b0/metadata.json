The not-so-subtle assassination suggestion was bellowed off camera near the front, while Paul Ryan was up on stage. The GOP congressman was well within earshot of the utterance, yet he continued babbling about Clinton scandals without standing up to the despicable crowd. That\u2019s right, the Speaker of the U.S. House, \u2018Mr. Speaker\u2019 to you and me, said nothing. \\nThis isn\u2019t the first time someone at a Trump rally blatantly suggested Hillary be assassinated, of course.The Donald himself suggested \u201c Second Amendment people \u201d might be able to do something about her if she were elected at a rally in August. After the shocking statement, Paul Ryan remarked to reporters the comment sounded, \u201clike a joke gone bad.\u201d Perhaps, Ryan thought this Trumpkin was joking, too. \\nThere are other possible explanations for his lack of reaction. Perhaps he didn\u2019t hear the scream. He is the Republican House speaker after all, he\u2019s used to ignoring people. Less likely, perhaps he doesn\u2019t know who Lee Harvey Oswald is and therefor didn\u2019t understand the reference. Or maybe he\u2019s a fan of Oliver Stone\u2019s film JFK and agrees that Oswald was just a \u201cpatsy.\u201d Being a Trump patsy himself, he might of merely assumed the deplorable was shouting support for him. \\nOr maybe, and most probably, he heard it, he got it and just didn\u2019t care. Afraid to stand up to Trump\u2019s mob. \\nWatch the video and decide for yourself: \\nNo matter what the reason for such an offensive lack of response, we can all agree it is time for Paul Ryan to step down, and not just from the stage. \\nFeatured image via ABC News Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742563411.931389}
