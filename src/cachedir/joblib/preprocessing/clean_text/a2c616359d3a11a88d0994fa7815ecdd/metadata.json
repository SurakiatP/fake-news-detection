He also noted that the Russian president \u201ctalks pretty straight,\u201d and hopes his documentary can help explain Putin\u2019s points of view to a Western audience. When questioned about allegations made by Democrats and the political left that President Trump has direct connections to Russia, Stone replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a path that leads nowhere to my mind. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s an internal war of politics in the US in which the Democratic party has taken a suicide pact or something to blow him up in other words, to completely   him and in so doing blow up the US essentially,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is destroying the trust that exists between people and government. It\u2019s a very dangerous position to make accusations you cannot prove. \u201d Read the Sydney Morning Herald\u2018s full interview with Stone here.
