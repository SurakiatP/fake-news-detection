Having long faced accusations that the Grammys overlook young, progressive black artists  \u2014   the last black woman to win album of the year was Lauryn Hill in 1999  \u2014   the Recording Academy faced a potential backlash for going   on a white, traditionalist choice like Adele. Indeed, it happened again. Now, building on a conversation that was already bubbling, some artists and industry observers are considering the potential fallout. \u201cMore and more artists are going to boycott and step away,\u201d Laura Stylez, a   of \u201cEbro in the Morning\u201d on the New York   and RB station Hot 97, said in an interview, citing the absence of Drake, Frank Ocean, Justin Bieber and Kanye West from this year\u2019s show, despite their major eligible releases and nominations. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to lose today\u2019s generation. They feel like they\u2019re not represented. \u201d Charlamagne Tha God, an influential radio personality from \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d on Power 105. 1, named Grammy voters his \u201cDonkey of the Day\u201d for their album of the year selection. \u201cI tell artists all the time: Go where you\u2019re celebrated, not where you\u2019re tolerated,\u201d he said, adding that Beyonc\u00e9 had been \u201crobbed. \u201d \u201cThey absolutely, positively got it wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Grammy committee should all feel foolish this morning, because even Adele acknowledged that she should not have won album of the year. \u201d Solange Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s sister and herself a Grammy winner this year for best RB performance, tweeted her dismay not long after Sunday\u2019s final award was presented, linking to an earlier diatribe by the singer Frank Ocean. Mr. Ocean, one of the most critically adored artists of the streaming generation, had declined to submit his music for consideration at this year\u2019s Grammys, calling the boycott his \u201cColin Kaepernick moment. \u201d In a blog post after insinuations from Grammy producers that his absence was because of a disappointing performance at the 2013 show, Mr. Ocean called out the Recording Academy for what he said was a \u201ccultural bias,\u201d referring specifically to last year\u2019s show, in which Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d won album of the year over the rapper Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly. \u201d After Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d lost to Adele\u2019s \u201c25\u201d on Sunday, Terrence Henderson, an executive at Mr. Lamar\u2019s label, Top Dawg Entertainment, also expressed his frustration. \u201cMaybe Frank had a point,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. This year\u2019s show was not entirely homogeneous. In addition to a Prince tribute and exemplary performances by Beyonc\u00e9 and A Tribe Called Quest, Chance the Rapper won three awards, including best new artist, for what was essentially an online mixtape. But the broader pattern was hard to ignore. In the last five years especially, albums by Mr. Ocean, Mr. Lamar and Beyonc\u00e9 have been passed over for the top award in favor of releases by white artists: Mumford  Sons, Daft Punk, Beck, Taylor Swift and Adele. Though Beyonc\u00e9 has 62 nominations and 22 wins overall, most have come in the designated RB categories, with only one in the big three of record, song or album of the year. \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\u201d won best song in 2010. Only 10 black artists have ever won album of the year the last was Herbie Hancock, then 67, for a collection of Joni Mitchell covers in 2008. In light of Adele\u2019s sweep on Sunday, the presentation of the award for best urban contemporary album, a minor hodgepodge of a category, to Beyonc\u00e9 for \u201cLemonade\u201d couldn\u2019t help but feel like a consolation prize. She used her one speech on the telecast to highlight the importance of her children\u2019s seeing themselves reflected at \u201cthe Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys. \u201d Beyond that, Beyonc\u00e9, who is stingy with her extemporaneous commentary, has not spoken about her Grammy defeat. But she did have a surprise planned, win or lose: A new song with DJ Khaled and her husband Jay Z, released exclusively on his streaming platform Tidal, called \u201cShining. \u201d \u201cAll of this winning, I\u2019ve been losing my mind,\u201d she sings, seemingly above it all. \u201cDon\u2019t try to slow me down. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561709.8482194}
