The unanimous ruling capped months of turmoil for a country that has been gripped by the corruption scandal that brought down Ms. Park. Since November, the center of Seoul, the capital, has been the site of weekly demonstrations, some of them enormous, demanding Ms. Park\u2019s ouster. Her powers were suspended in December, after a legislative impeachment vote. Her opponents were in the streets on Friday for the ruling, cheering as the court verdict was read. Supporters of Ms. Park tried to pass a barricade of police buses protecting the Constitutional Court, which ruled that Ms. Park had \u201cbetrayed the trust of the people. \u201d Some of the demonstrators called for \u201cdestroying\u201d the court. Some of Ms. Park\u2019s supporters, most of them older South Koreans, attacked the police with flagpoles. As Ms. Park\u2019s standing plummeted in recent months, her remaining backers tended to be people who fondly remembered her father, the Cold War dictator Park  . Other protesters threw water bottles and pieces of pavement. The acting president, Hwang   called for national unity and urged Ms. Park\u2019s supporters to accept the court\u2019s ruling. Three demonstrators, ages 60, 72 and 74, died during the unrest. One had fallen from the top of a police bus, a hospital official told The Associated Press. An additional 30 protesters and police officers were injured in the clashes, The A. P. said.'"}, "time": 1742561813.0867834}
