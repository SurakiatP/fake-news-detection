Indeed, these figures categorically debunk the notion the criminal justice system in the United States maintains any semblance of its formation\u2019s original intent: to ensure the guilty suffer punishment befitting their crimes, while the innocent avoid false conviction. \\nAs the fundamental basis for the justice system in the United States, the Sixth Amendment states: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d \\nJustice, as an untold \u2014 though no doubt, appalling \u2014 number can attest, has been utterly abandoned for the interests of the careless expedience , apathetic convenience, and unabashed profiteering of the U.S. prison-industrial machine. \\n\u201cThe reality is that almost no one who is imprisoned in America has gotten a trial,\u201d explains award-winning journalist, Chris Hedges, in a recent Truthdig column . \u201cThere is rarely an impartial investigation. A staggering 97 percent of all federal cases and 95 percent of all state felony cases are resolved through plea bargaining.\u201d Of those millions who bargained away their right to a trial by accepting plea deals, \u201csignificant percentages of them are innocent.\u201d \\nPlea bargaining failed in its attempt to facilitate pragmatic justice seen in earlier courts, before the advent of the \u201cadversary system and the related development of the law of evidence,\u201d as John H. Langein once described . After the Civil War, as Judge Jed S. Rakoff explained in the New York Review of Books , rising crime and immigration rates began to burden the system and plea bargains offered an acceptable solution. In other words, court proceedings were at one time swift and simple, and though such expediency might have seemed a desirable quality in the past, the incontrovertible reality at present is a system wholly focused on speed at the expense of the necessary \u2014 in fact, imperative \u2014 assumption of innocence of the accused. \\nIndeed, for incontrovertible proof the court system no longer functions for the people \u2014 neither in its capacity to protect the public from the actual criminals, nor in its ostensible assurances no innocent person will be punished unfairly \u2014 take even a cursory glance at the trial system. Plea bargains have actualized a replacement of justice with a farcical, well-oiled machine of incarceration. \u201cIn actuality,\u201d as Rakoff described, \u201cour criminal justice system is almost exclusively a system of plea bargaining, negotiated behind closed doors and with no judicial oversight. The outcome is very largely determined by the prosecutor alone.\u201d \\nOf all federal criminal cases, \u201cfewer than 3 percent went to trial. The plea bargains largely determined the sentences imposed.\u201d \\nPlea deals are presented to defendants as a way to escape the near certainty of a heavy-handed sentence should they be found guilty by a jury at trial \u2014 because defense attorneys\u2019 and prosecutors\u2019 most pressing goal is to prevent a trial in the first place. \u201cOnce you are charged in America,\u201d Hedges said, \u201cwhether you did the crime or not, you are almost always found guilty.\u201d \\nIn part, such \u2018unconditional guilt\u2019 begat the need for The Innocence Project \u2014 \u201ca national litigation and public policy organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals through DNA testing and reforming the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.\u201d Since 1989, there have been 337 DNA-related exonerations with individuals having served a combined total of around 4,606 unjustified years \u2014 an average of 14 years, each, before being freed. Of those 337 cases, 31 individuals , who had served over 150 combined years, \u201cpled guilty to crimes they didn\u2019t commit \u2014 usually seeking to avoid the potential for a long sentence (or a death sentence),\u201d states The Innocence Project\u2019s website. \\n\u201cIf all of the accused went to trial, the judicial system, which is designed around plea agreements, would collapse. And this is why trial sentences are horrific. It is why public attorneys routinely urge their clients to accept a plea arrangement. Trials are a flashing red light to the accused: DO NOT DO THIS. It is the inversion of justice. \u201d Of the students he teaches in prison, those \u201cwho have the longest sentences are usually the ones who demanded a trial.\u201d \\nWhile the rich and powerful, especially those associated with corporations and banks , are able to escape significant punishment \u2014 even when their crimes affect millions of people, such as those complicit in the 2008 financial crash \u2014 the poor, whether guilty or not, fall victim to this slanted system. As Hedges summarized: \\n\u201cIf you are poor, you will be railroaded in an assembly-line production, from a town or city where there are no jobs, through the police stations, county jails and courts directly into prison. And if you are poor, because you don\u2019t have any money for adequate legal defense, you will serve sentences that are decades longer than those for equivalent crimes anywhere else in the industrialized world \u2026 Being poor has become a crime. And this makes mass incarceration the most pressing civil rights issue of our era.\u201d Share'"}, "time": 1742564597.556707}
