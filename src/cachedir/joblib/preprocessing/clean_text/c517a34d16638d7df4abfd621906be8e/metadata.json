All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it,\u201d Romeny had stated. \u201cThat that\u2019s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what\u2026These are people who pay no income tax.\u201d \\nIn the newly released Veritas footage however, Scott Foval, the former field director of Americans United for Change, admits that they were actually behind the video which was released by David Corn of Mother Jones. \\n. @oreillyfactor breaks new video showing @woodhouseb / Scott Foval was responsible for @DavidCornDC video, not \"bartender\" pic.twitter.com/IxpfHdqpB6 \\n\u2014 James O\\'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 27, 2016 \\n\\nFoval explains that his group has been doing \u201cinsertions\u201d to interrupt fundraisers and rallies as far back as 2000 and 2004, against George W. Bush \u2014 and that they were responsible for the one that ended Romney\u2019s campaign. \\n\u201cThey do it all over the country, yeah. And then I don\u2019t know if you remember, well from, they are the ones who negotiated to get that lawyer in Florida who recorded the 47% video,\u201d Foval states. \\n\u201cWait, I thought that was a bartender,\u201d the undercover reporter asks. \\n\u201cIt was actually a lawyer at the event,\u201d Foval explains. \u201cIt was not a bartender.\u201d \\n\u201cThe lawyer took his phone and had the bartender walk around with it and set it up,\u201d Foval continues. \u201cIt was a whole coordinated operation to get the phone in because they had taken away all the cell phones from all the staff and so what they did was they set it up in the room.\u201d \\nFoval continued to explain that the organization has a team of approximately 25 people who conduct these operations. \\nIn previous video releases from Veritas, Foval reveals how his organization had been working to incite violence at Trump rallies, using a tactic called \u201cbird-dogging.\u201d \\nThe hidden camera videos have also revealed their step-by-step voter fraud strategy. \\nEarlier in the day, the organization released their fourth undercover video, where Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners claimed that he was on daily calls with the Clinton campaign, and accepts a potentially-illegal foreign donation. \\n\u201cThe more money that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get,\u201d Project Veritas said in their release . \\nO\u2019Keefe has filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission against both Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee based upon the shocking revelations that his team has uncovered. \\nDuring a rally in Gettysburg on Saturday, Trump promised that he would also be suing the DNC for inciting violence at his rallies, based on what he saw in the Project Veritas videos. \\nThe post Project Veritas: Implicated Democratic Operatives Claim Credit for Romney 47% Video appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742561741.6610088}
