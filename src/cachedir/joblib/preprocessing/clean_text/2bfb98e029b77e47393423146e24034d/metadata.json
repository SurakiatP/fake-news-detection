But when Mr. Zhou heard last week that the Chinese government had executed the farmer, Jia Jinglong, he was furious. He saw it as a sign that the ruling Communist Party was imposing harsh punishments on the most vulnerable members of society while coddling the   elite. \u201cThe legal system isn\u2019t fair,\u201d Mr. Zhou, 57, said, adding that local officials had \u201cturned against the common people. \u201d President Xi Jinping has made restoring confidence in Chinese courts a centerpiece of his rule, vowing to promote \u201csocial justice and equality\u201d in a legal system long plagued by favoritism and abuse. Since coming to power in 2012, he has led a   campaign against corruption, ensnaring thousands of   officials and even some of the party\u2019s most senior leaders. But the furor over the execution of Mr. Jia, who had sought revenge on officials for demolishing his home, has raised doubts about Mr. Xi\u2019s efforts, with people across the country publicly assailing inequities in the justice system and asking why   officials often escape the death penalty. \u201cThe perception is that the people are powerless and vulnerable against corrupt officials,\u201d said Fu Hualing, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cWhat is surprising is that Xi Jinping has been in power for four years, and that narrative has not changed. \u201d The uproar has placed the party, which is working to tighten its grip on courts while promoting the idea of fairness, in an awkward position. Mr. Xi has cultivated an image as a champion of the people willing to take on corrupt officials of any stripe. Yet Mr. Jia\u2019s case has reawakened concerns, especially among rural residents and members of the urban working class, that the Communist Party is protecting its own members. In fiery social media posts and   conversations, some have argued for making punishments against corrupt officials more severe. Others have suggested that China, believed to be the world\u2019s top executioner, should substantially reduce its use of the death penalty against impoverished citizens. China\u2019s leaders seem conflicted about how to respond to complaints of unfair treatment, which have plagued the judiciary for decades but have taken on new urgency as Mr. Xi attempts a    overhaul of the system. On the one hand, party leaders might be wary of exacerbating the anger felt by many Chinese people, who often side with villagers like Mr. Jia, seeing them as folk heroes standing up against venal forces. At the same time, Beijing might not want to be seen as endorsing an attack on a government official. And some party leaders may not like the idea of setting a precedent for using the death penalty against senior officials, at a time when critics of Mr. Xi say he is using the anticorruption campaign to go after political enemies. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong incentive for the elite within the party to protect itself,\u201d said Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor. \u201cPeople realize today they\u2019re free, but tomorrow they could be the targets. \u201d In recent days, the party\u2019s hesitation has seeped into public view. The government at first appeared to tolerate, and even encourage, debate about Mr. Jia\u2019s case. Lawyers issued open letters pointing to flaws in the prosecution\u2019s argument, and state media outlets published sanctimonious editorials calling for the court to show humanity. But as discontent spread on social media in the days leading up to Mr. Jia\u2019s execution, the government reversed course and began censoring some online discussions about the case.   media organizations adopted a scolding tone, warning that public opinion had \u201chijacked\u201d the case. People\u2019s Daily, the party\u2019s flagship newspaper, went a step further, arguing that citizens should not express contrarian views about court cases in public. \u201cWe can see that online public opinion can deviate from reason and even become a terrifying tool that kills humanity and conscience,\u201d an editorial in the newspaper said. While the government has historically tolerated some debate about judicial decisions, Mr. Xi has generally sought to rein in dissent, especially when it gathers force online. Li Wei, an activist in Beijing who was imprisoned for two years under Mr. Xi for helping organize protests demanding financial disclosures from party leaders, circulated a   petition online in late October calling for Mr. Jia to be spared and for the government to adopt a \u201cmore humane\u201d justice system. Soon his cellphone was buzzing with messages from university students, professors, security guards and others. He gathered 1, 274 signatures over a few days, he said, before the authorities shut down his social media accounts. \u201cThe   anticorruption campaign is not genuine,\u201d Mr. Li, 45, said in an interview at a Beijing teahouse. \u201cThe reason why they were doing this is because they want to salvage the Communist Party regime. \u201d Chinese leaders appear to be working to counter perceptions that officials are being treated with kid gloves. Over the past year, party leaders have vowed to consider punishing officials who commit grave crimes, including stealing more than about $436, 000, with the death penalty. They have also introduced new forms of punishment aimed at corrupt officials, including lifetime jail sentences without the possibility of parole. But the government has yet to systematically invoke any of those punishments against prominent officials. And critics can point to a raft of recent cases in which powerful people and their families escaped the death penalty. There is the example of Zhou Yongkang, China\u2019s former security chief, who was sentenced to life in prison last year for taking bribes and revealing state secrets he was the most senior leader to be jailed for corruption in more than 65 years of Communist rule. And many people note the case of Gu Kailai, the wife of one of China\u2019s most prominent politicians, whose death sentence for the murder of a British business associate was commuted to life in prison last year. Fan Zhewang, 42, a teacher of Maoism at Xi\u2019an University of Posts and Telecommunications in central China, said the treatment of Ms. Gu epitomized the inequities in the system. Mr. Fan said that while the government\u2019s decision to execute Mr. Jia was legal, he was concerned that a lingering sense of injustice and resentment among villagers would prompt more violence against officials. \u201cIn the future,\u201d Mr. Fan said, \u201cI worry that people will just kill whole families of village chiefs. \u201d On Wednesday, a day after Mr. Jia was executed, a farmer in Yan\u2019an, a northwestern city celebrated as a stronghold of the Communist revolution, was arrested and charged with killing a village official and several of his relatives, according to local reports. The man was said to be angry after officials seized his land. In the days after the execution of Mr. Jia, friends and relatives in his village in the northern province of Hebei circulated a poem he wrote while in prison in which he described being in a dreamlike state. \u201cI\u2019ll miss the smell of flowers,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand the serenity of grass, something I love. \u201d Villagers said they did not want to talk about the case anymore. A man who gave his last name as Li said residents had grown accustomed to suffering injustices at the hands of wealthy government officials. \u201cWho do you turn to in order to vent your anger?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one we can seek help from. \u201d \u201cMany people are angry,\u201d he added, \u201cbut we don\u2019t dare speak up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562729.1281846}
