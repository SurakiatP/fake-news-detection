So, in Sunday\u2019s Season 6 finale, there was a macabre symmetry to the fact that Jaime\u2019s own son, the callow King Tommen, leapt to his death from a castle window. The paired calamities, loosely linked by a long string of still more deaths and dismemberment, including Jaime\u2019s loss of his hand, reflect the series\u2019s long game, in which acts of malice lead inexorably to more of the same. \u201cHe once said, \u2018The things I do for love,\u2019 and it was all about protecting his sister and also the kids,\u201d said Nikolaj   the man who plays Jaime. \u201cNow they\u2019re all gone. \u201d [ \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Recap: Long May She Reign ] Jaime entered the story as a louche villain but has evolved into a more shaded figure, torn between his toxic devotion to his lover and twin sister, Cersei, and more honorable impulses. The finale ended with Jaime at a crossroads, confronted with the loss of yet another child and positioned yet again between Cersei, who claimed the throne in an explosive coup, and his brother, Tyrion, currently returning to the capital city with Cersei\u2019s rival for power, Daenerys Targaryen. \u201cWe won\u2019t find out until next season how Jaime reacts to that,\u201d said Mr.   45, who is Danish. \u201cThe cruel irony is he killed the Mad King in order to save King\u2019s Landing, and he comes back to find out his sister pulled the trigger instead. \u201d In a telephone interview on Monday afternoon, Mr.   discussed the perils of loving a mad queen, Jaime\u2019s bond with Brienne and possible \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spinoffs. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Congratulations on surviving another season. Hey, hallelujah. What was Season 6 about for Jaime?  It was a season of dramatic change again for him. He was sacked from the job he thought he couldn\u2019t get sacked from  \u2014   he\u2019s no longer a Kingsguard. He\u2019s back to just being Jaime Lannister that\u2019s the massive change. Coming back with a dead child was horrific. Leaving King\u2019s Landing the season before, at least they were in control. Coming back, he\u2019s faced with this crazy religious uprising and the High Sparrow, and he\u2019s not really equipped to deal with someone like that. Unfortunately, Cersei then found a way. Every time he leaves King\u2019s Landing, something horrible happens.  In the final scene, Jaime gave Cersei an intense but ambiguous look. What was that about? I think basically he\u2019s in shock. So many things are going through his head  \u2014   you look down and you see your sister telling the rest of the world to go to hell. The woman you love has turned into this seemingly mad woman. If you were a couples counselor, you would tell him to maybe reconsider this relationship. What would it take for him to finally forsake her? I\u2019ve asked myself that question quite a few times. This is such an extreme world, but I\u2019m sure there are people in your life where you go, why in the hell are these people together? Their relationship is abusive, and why do people stay in that? Or even get addicted to dysfunctional relationships. But I don\u2019t know how far he has to be pushed. If he can forgive her for this, I think he can forgive her for everything. She was responsible for genocide, she forced their last child to commit suicide. On a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being this is the moment when you have to leave, I think we are at 99. 9. But it\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d so you never know. I was struck by the parallels between Tommen\u2019s death and when you shoved Bran out the window to kick off this whole story. It\u2019s a bookend to what\u2019s driven him. If Bran had told anyone what he\u2019d seen, the three kids would have been killed there and then. Now they\u2019re all gone. What seemingly was Cersei\u2019s whole reason for being  \u2014   to keep them safe and to keep them powerful, is now gone. She only has herself and Jaime, but really just herself. So I think it is an end to what has been such a huge part of the motivation for these characters. Jaime began the show as a villain. What does his evolution into a more sympathetic person symbolize? How does it fit within the broader story? It\u2019s always about how much information you have. In the beginning, we only saw his actions we didn\u2019t get to understand why he did it. Then later we realize, hang on a second, maybe he\u2019s not a complete [expletive] maybe he had reasons to do these horrible things. He\u2019s seen a lot of crazy stuff. The Riverrun story line was, in a way, about the craziness of war. You have a guy in a castle who doesn\u2019t want to give it up. He\u2019s outnumbered and refuses out of pride, and if that means he\u2019s going to have to sacrifice thousands of his own men, so be it. The logic behind it  \u2014   I think Jaime has found the empathy, and the understanding that, hang on a second, this is crazy. At least that\u2019s what I hope maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it. He\u2019s getting older and he\u2019s experienced real loss  \u2014   he\u2019s lost his father, he\u2019s lost his daughter. You can argue in some ways he\u2019s lost his sister  \u2014   she\u2019s definitely gone to the dark force. That changes you. He was briefly reunited with Brienne at Riverrun, too. How would you characterize their relationship? When they spent that long journey together back to King\u2019s Landing and learned to trust each other, I think that was the first time Jaime ever spent time with a grown woman other than his sister. She represents the best parts of me, and clearly there\u2019s a love and an attraction, but it\u2019s an impossible scenario. They\u2019re both dedicated to other people\u2019s needs. And I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever be able to put themselves first. How was Season 6 different from previous ones? Obviously, there\u2019s the whole being off book. But I felt there was a sense of the whole thing getting close to the end. As Dan [Weiss] and David [Benioff, the show\u2019s creators] have said, there\u2019s 13 episodes left now. It\u2019s not that much when you consider the amount of characters and worlds. Getting to the end of Episode 10, you feel almost like, we made it. Daenerys is on her way, she\u2019s got her ships, the whole thing is in motion. I thought every episode had some kind of step forward. Even the episodes that were about laying down story lines, there was always something that got us closer to that final shot of Daenerys on her way. Season 5 was the most depressing of all the seasons, ending, of course, with Jon Snow\u2019s death. This season we started with his resurrection  \u2014   there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel, we can fight this thing. The end of Season 5 was the turning point. Of course, Daenerys is the beautiful hero and she wants to bring beautiful change, but she\u2019s also using these weapons of mass destruction. You can see King\u2019s Landing burning even more now, and that\u2019s a scary thought. As the show enters its homestretch, and it\u2019s a huge hit, there have been spinoff rumors. Can you see any   spinoffs? Jaime and Bronn hit the road? Jaime and Brienne get an apartment together?  Yeah, that\u2019s the one. What would you call that? \u201cRoommates\u201d? \u201cHeartslayer\u201d? It could be a  . [Laughs.] \u201cThe Heartslayer\u201d! Yeah, why not. But it has to be a sitcom, though, and it has to have a laugh track. Then I would do it in a heartbeat. I thought we\u2019d have a season where we just did the whole thing in a cabaret. Varys would be the owner of the club, because I know Conleth Hill would be amazing at that. And we\u2019d all come in and do little things. Last year we did a Coldplay musical. I thought that was the finest moment we had. Conleth Hill has starred in plenty of stage musicals he could pull that off. He would be amazing. There are so many ways you could go, and let\u2019s milk it. Let\u2019s do it for the rest of our careers  \u2014   just \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spinoffs.'"}, "time": 1742563924.8341067}
