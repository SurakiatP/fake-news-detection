In a video posted to YouTube last month, a mother of four girls, who does not identify herself by name, says that she was driving her daughter to school when she heard \u201cNorf Norf,\u201d a song from Mr. Staples\u2019s 2015 album \u201cSummertime \u201906. \u201d \u201cThis rap song comes on. Guys, I could not believe what I was hearing,\u201d she says, adding that she usually tunes her car radio to Christian music but put on a \u201ctop hits\u201d station at her   \u2019s request. \u201cThis is on our local radio station? This crap is being played?\u201d She continues, \u201cI couldn\u2019t even believe the words I was listening to. As a mom, it infuriated me. \u201d The      video has received more than 800, 000 views. The lyrics of \u201cNorf Norf\u201d are explicit, painting a violent picture of Mr. Staples\u2019 adolescent years in Long Beach, Calif. In her reaction video, the mother reads the words aloud, bursting into tears several times. She seems particularly taken aback by the repetitive line of the chorus: \u201cI ain\u2019t never ran from nothin\u2019 but the police. \u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just encourage kids to run from the police because that\u2019s O. K. right? ,\u201d she says. \u201cWe wonder why this society is so messed up  \u2014   just listen to the music. \u201d But responding to the video on Wednesday, Mr. Staples said that the woman seemed confused and frightened, and went on to defend her. \u201cNo person needs to be attacked for their opinion on what they see to be appropriate for their children,\u201d Mr. Staples tweeted. \u201cThey have a right to it. \u201d He continued, \u201cThis misunderstanding of our community leads to miscommunication which we should convert into a progressive dialogue. \u201d He then declared that he was done speaking about the issue. Mr. Staples\u2019s tweets, which were meant  to clarify earlier comments in The Independent, were a contrast to the mother\u2019s disgust and to those who had mocked her ignorance about rap by responding to the video with laughing emojis or syncing the audio from the YouTube video with the beat of \u201cNorf Norf. \u201d Others blasted her comments as racist and ignorant. David Dennis Jr. a journalism professor at Morehouse College who has covered   online for close to a decade, said that Mr. Staples\u2019s thoughtful reaction was \u201cextremely unusual. \u201d \u201cTwitter is 140 characters of quick reactions and not a lot of nuance whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Dennis said. \u201cThere are brilliant people who, when they get on Twitter, they sort of become the lowest common denominators of themselves. \u201d He said that the rapper\u2019s experience as a public figure with a vast online following may have helped him empathize with the mother. \u201cAs a famous rapper, he sort of knows how Twitter mob mentality works,\u201d Mr. Dennis said. \u201cThrough the lens of somebody who goes viral a lot, I think that empathy is something he learned. \u201d In an interview in The Fader soon after \u201cSummertime \u201806\u201d was released, Mr. Staples talked about people he knew who were trapped in a cycle of gang violence. His attitude toward them mirrored his comments about the mother. \u201cI just want to help people understand that we don\u2019t get to pick, bro,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to pick where we was from. That ain\u2019t how it works. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562307.3167884}
