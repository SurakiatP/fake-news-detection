The demographics of the party have changed:\\n\\nInterestingly, Bill Clinton also gets it. The former president has been on the stump \u2013 ostensibly to differentiate his wife from President Obama \u2013 pointing out the fact that the middle class has been abandoned, and that these desperate people are turning to populist because they have lost something tangible in the last eight years.\\nAs The Daily Sheeple reported :\\nA leaked Democratic fundraising speech Bill Clinton gave back in 2015 shows the former president telling donors that thanks to Obama, lower-income whites have lower life expectancies because they \u201cdon\u2019t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning\u201d now.\\nBill is tacitly acknowledging the impact that terrible trade deals have had on the American economy and jobs over the last 30 years\u2026\\nNot only is Bill trying to sound like a straight-talking mix of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, he is acknowledging the same new party identities that voters have assumed.\\nWhile Hillary may take the electoral college votes handily enough, the popular votes will reflect a sentiment of anger and unrest in the population.\\nAs the NY Times noted :\\n[Democrats/Hillary campaign] have effectively swapped much of their working-class white base for the so-called rising demographic of millennials, nonwhite voters and suburbanites clustered near cities such as Denver, Miami, Las Vegas and Washington.\\nFrom watching these communities, it will become clear on Tuesday why Mrs. Clinton\u2019s party enjoys a structural advantage in the Electoral College. But this election may also hasten the day when more of the heartland becomes out of reach, illustrating what Democrats lost as much as what they gained. \\nThe common thread is that a combination of trade deals and economic policies has destroyed the wealth of \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d \u2013 shrinking the middle class and piling pressure onto the lower and working classes who must increasingly depend upon government assistance for their survival.\\nRead more: \\nTrump Accuses Fed of Not Raising Rates Because Obama \u201cDoesn\u2019t Want a Bubble Burst\u201d Until He Leaves \\nEPIC RANT: Fed Up American Explains Why Trump Will Win: \u201cSomebody With Balls\u201d \\nCollapse Strategist: \u201cWe\u2019re In The Terminal Phase\u2026 Economic Pain Like We\u2019ve Never Seen Before\u201d \\nTrump Tuesday Means A Shift Of Power for Establishment\u2026 And They Are Freaked \\nDavos Insider Vows Trump Defeat: \u201cIt Doesn\u2019t Matter Who the GOP Puts Up, Hillary Will Win\u201d '"}, "time": 1742628545.5528805}
