Trump on Thursday for his lewd comments about women, exhorting voters in scathing terms to reject his candidacy and the campaign\u2019s increasingly vulgar tenor by backing Hillary Clinton as a matter of conscience. \u201cThis is not normal. This is not politics as usual,\u201d Mrs. Obama said in a   speech here during which her voice at times quavered with emotion. \u201cThis is disgraceful, it is intolerable, and it doesn\u2019t matter what party you belong to,\u201d she added. \u201cNo woman deserves to be treated this way  \u2014   none of us deserves this kind of abuse. \u201d In remarks that were among the most outspoken by a first lady in modern history, Mrs. Obama, who has mostly avoided the political limelight, positioned herself at the center of a campaign she characterized as having devolved into \u201cmadness. \u201d She implored voters to \u201cstand up and say enough is enough. \u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women,\u201d the first lady told several hundred voters at a university here. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about this  \u2014   it has shaken me to my core,\u201d Mrs. Obama said, reacting to the emergence last week of a recording in which Mr. Trump was heard coarsely boasting about kissing and groping women without their consent. What followed from the first lady, who has styled herself America\u2019s \u201cmom in chief,\u201d was a message about empowering women to rise up against sexual abuse and harassment in every context. The speech was all the more striking because it was delivered on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, whose experience with her husband\u2019s infidelity all but disqualifies her from speaking in similarly vivid terms. Aides said Mrs. Obama had always planned to reshape her stump speech as Election Day neared to focus more on women and the significance of electing the first female president. But when Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks surfaced on Friday, she ripped up that speech, ultimately settling on one that was all the more biting for its intimate tone. \u201cI feel it so personally,\u201d Mrs. Obama said on Thursday, placing her hand against her heart for emphasis as she spoke about Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women. \u201cIt\u2019s like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you\u2019re walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body, or when you see that guy at work that stands just a little too close, stares a little too long so you feel uncomfortable in your own skin. \u201d \u201cI can tell you that the men in my life do not talk about women this way,\u201d Mrs. Obama added. \u201cTo dismiss this as everyday locker room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere. \u201d The speech was a riveting moment in an already remarkable campaign, coming just before Mr. Trump appeared in West Palm Beach, Fla. to angrily denounce as \u201cfalse smears\u201d news reports in which several women said he had made unwanted advances on them. The New Hampshire rally was Mrs. Obama\u2019s sixth campaign appearance for Mrs. Clinton in a month, and the first lady broke from her usual approach and did not speak about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s qualifications for the presidency until halfway through her speech. She said the former secretary of state \u201cembodies so many of the values that we try hard to teach our young people,\u201d and ticked off highlights from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9, saying that any parent would be proud to raise a daughter like her. But she also sought to appeal to those unenthusiastic about Mrs. Clinton or politics itself, issuing a call to voters across the political spectrum who have been alienated by a contest dominated by outrageous statements and partisan rage. \u201cWe simply cannot endure this, or expose our children to this any longer  \u2014   not for another minute, and let alone for four years,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. \u201cThis has got to stop right now. \u201d She argued that even voters repulsed by the tone of the campaign  \u2014   \u201cwe are drowning in it,\u201d she said at one point  \u2014   must consider the norms of behavior they wanted to instill in their children. \u201cIn our hearts, we all know that if we let Hillary\u2019s opponent win this election, then we are sending a clear message to our kids that everything they\u2019re seeing and hearing is perfectly O. K. We are validating it. We are endorsing it,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019re telling our sons that it\u2019s O. K. to humiliate women. We\u2019re telling our daughters that this is how they deserve to be treated. We\u2019re telling all our kids that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable in the leader of their country. \u201d Instead, she framed the decision to vote for Mrs. Clinton as akin to a woman\u2019s choice to speak out in the face of sexual mistreatment or violence. \u201cWe need to recover from our shock and depression and do what women have always done in this country,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. \u201cWe need you to roll up your sleeves. We need to get to work. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563281.22014}
