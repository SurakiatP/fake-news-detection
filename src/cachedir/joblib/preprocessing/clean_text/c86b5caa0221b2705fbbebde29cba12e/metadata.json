At present time, they have the capability of wiping the entire East Coast of the United States off the map \u2013 where more than 100 million people live. Will the ranking misleaders in Washington continue to gamble with all of our lives? \\nVLADIMIR Putin\u2019s nuclear stockpile could completely destroy the east coast of the US in one clean swipe should the Russian leader launch an attack on the West, an expert has warned. \\nA staggering 112.6million people could be at risk of extermination from the deadly missiles. \\nRussia has the largest haul of nuclear weapons of any country in the world and reportedly has the most powerful bomb named the SS-18 \u2013 menacingly nicknamed the Satan. \\nExperts estimate Russia has 55 of the deadly weapons, but only five would be needed to destroy the East Coast of the US. \\n[\u2026] \\n\u201cFive or six of these \u2018Satans\u2019 as they are known by the US military, and the East Coast of the United States disappears.\u201d \\nDr Roberts said: \u201cThe atomic bombs that Washington dropped on these helpless civilian centres while the Japanese government was trying to surrender, were mere popguns compared to today\u2019s thermo-nuclear weapons. \\nWhat\u2019s more, the Russian have hinted strongly at the possibility that they would be able to disable electronics, communications and defense shields in the U.S. via electromagnetic warfare \u2013 perhaps an EMP . \\nWorst of all, the American misleaders haven\u2019t even got a good reason for putting the population at such a risk \u2013 strategy in the middle east is muddied at best, and prodding for war with Russia doesn\u2019t carry a clear narrative either. \\nThe world could change, and American power could end in a few decisive minutes. \\nHopefully it would never come to that, but we shouldn\u2019t live in a false world where we pretend these situations can\u2019t harm us.
