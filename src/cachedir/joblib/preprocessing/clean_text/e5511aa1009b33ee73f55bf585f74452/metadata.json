[Brock, who founded the   watchdog Media Matters for America as well as Super PACs such as Correct the Record and American Bridge sees himself as a key figure in rebuilding the Democratic Party following Donald Trump\u2019s ascent to the presidency.  Recently, Brock has pleaded for funding to help him build an   war room, which seeks to hold the the current administration accountable on a daily basis and, in his own words, \u201ckick Trump\u2019s ass. \u201d He aspires to make his Shareblue website \u201cthe Breitbart of the Left. \u201d However, according to multiple sources at The Daily Beast, many Democrats believe he damages the party and just wish he would go away. Talking to The Daily Beast, Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, described Brock\u2019s ability to improve the party\u2019s electability as \u201cnonexistent,\u201d adding that \u201che does not have the kind of understanding of what kind of coalition you have to bring together to win national races. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think David Brock has been helpful to the party to date, and I don\u2019t think he will be a big part of its future,\u201da former Clinton campaign official also told the news site, while another said that they \u201cdid not want to deal with Brock\u2019s bullshit,\u201d describing his   campaign efforts as \u201cuseless,\u201d adding that \u201cyou might as well have thrown those [tens of] millions of dollars down a well, and then set the well on fire. \u201d A source close to The Daily Beast also said that while Brock had reached out to various Clinton campaign staff to join his \u201cwar room\u201d effort, they all declined because \u201cno one wants anything to do with him. \u201d Other former employees of Brock also said that he tends to \u201coverstate his level of impact and importance,\u201d adding that \u201cthat he cares less about progressive policies and moving the ball forward, and is actually more focused on stroking his ego. \u201d Brock\u2019s main project, the   watchdog Media Matters for America group, was in 2012 exposed as attempting the wholesale destruction of conservative media. A leaked internal document showed that Brock\u2019s organization hoped to \u201cbring litigation against Fox News and its feeders. \u201d However, the organization now reportedly pivots its focus towards Breitbart, instead of FOX News. Another one of Brock\u2019s organizations, Correct the Record, spent $1 million to hire online trolls to \u201ccorrect\u201d supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) across social media. Defending his record, Brock told The Daily Beast that \u201cpeople are free to question my motives, but it should be pretty clear by now that the groups that I\u2019ve created are committed to a more progressive America.\u201c \u201cI\u2019m interested in building   organizational capacity to resist and oppose Donald Trump,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think that should be everybody\u2019s goal on the left, to destroy Donald Trump, not to destroy each other. \u201d You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742563148.8531444}
