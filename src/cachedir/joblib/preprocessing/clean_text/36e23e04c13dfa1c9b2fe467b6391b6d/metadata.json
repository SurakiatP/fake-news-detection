As progressive journalist David Sirota suggested two years ago , reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed, right-wing capitalists such as the Koch brothers and Texas billionaire John Arnold had (along with more liberal software mogul Bill Gates) influenced PBS content through multimillion-dollar donations, the \u201cP\u201d in PBS often seems to more properly stand for \u201cPlutocratic,\u201d not \u201cPublic.\u201d \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nNone of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively big-business-dominated history of U.S. broadcast media . Because the United States fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting, both PBS and National Public Radio (a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology) depend upon foundations, corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming. Beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content, these private funders have bottom-line agendas, meaning that their contributions come with strings attached\u2014strings that undermine the integrity of the \u201cindependent\u201d journalism they bankroll. (For what it\u2019s worth, between 1994 and 2014, the \u201cNewsHour\u201d was primarily owned by the for-profit firm Liberty Media . Liberty Media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire John Malone, who had a majority stake in MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, the show\u2019s producer.) \\nThe Pentagon Broadcasting System? \\nWhat might seem more surprising, perhaps, is the remarkable extent to which the \u201cP\u201d in PBS often seems to stand for \u201cPentagon,\u201d or perhaps \u201cPresidential,\u201d when it comes to foreign policy content. Whatever the global issue of the day or week, \u201cNewsHour\u201d anchors and their invited \u201cexperts\u201d can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that Washington always operates with the best of intentions. They almost uniformly treat the U.S. as a great, benevolent and indispensable force for freedom, democracy, security, peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors. \\nThe show\u2019s invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nation\u2019s imperial establishment. They are commonly current or retired insiders from within the Pentagon, the White House, the \u201cintelligence community\u201d and/or the nation\u2019s elite network of foreign policy think tanks: the Council on Foreign Relations (the granddaddy of all U.S. ruling-class think tanks ), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Aspen Institute, the Atlantic Council, the Rand Corp. and the Hoover Institution, to name a handful. \u201cNewsHour\u201d anchors and guests generally agree that the United States\u2019 officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained, controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy, Uncle Sam. \\nNot surprisingly, the long and ongoing record of U.S. imperial arrogance and criminality (more on that below) is swept down George Orwell\u2019s memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry. When reported by the \u201cNewsHour,\u201d horrific crimes committed by the U.S. military are always treated as well-intended mistakes. Along with the rest of the mainstream U.S. media, the \u201cNewsHour\u201d \u201cinsist[s] that Russia deliberately bombs hospitals, etc., whereas if we do it, it is, of course, an accident .\u201d \\nThere\u2019s some room for disagreement between and among the show\u2019s invited experts\u2014including the show\u2019s semi-loopy foreign policy authority, Margaret Warner\u2014about specific U.S. foreign policy tactics, strategies and actions. There\u2019s no space for serious debate about the immorality, lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy. On the rare occasions \u201cNewsHour\u201d anchors seem to challenge guests from the White House or Pentagon on foreign policy matters, it is generally to ask why the U.S. isn\u2019t going harder at the officially certified bad guys. \\nAmerica as Umpire, Not Empire \\nThe foreign policy coverage and commentary doesn\u2019t get much better in the documentary division of PBS. A recent documentary (first aired nationally last week) shown by PBS bears the risible title \u201cAmerican Umpire\u201d\u2014an obvious World Series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an American empire. It is narrated by ex-Marine and former \u201cNewsHour\u201d host and producer Jim Lehrer. Developed by the right-wing Hoover Institution and \u201ctargeted for PBS\u201d (the organization\u2019s own revealing phrase), \u201cAmerican Umpire\u201d takes the doctrinal \u201cAmerican exceptionalist,\u201d U.S.-good-and-civilized-rest-of-world-dangerous-and-bad narrative to absurd lengths. \\nIt provides extensive \u201cexpert\u201d commentary from such former imperial operatives as Madeline Albright (the onetime U.S. secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb Serbia and who went on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d to say that the death of more than half a million Iraqi children killed by Washington-led \u201ceconomic sanctions\u201d was \u201ca price worth paying\u201d for the advance of U.S. foreign policy goals), Condoleezza Rice (George W. Bush\u2019s neoconservative national security adviser before and during the arch-criminal U.S. invasion of Iraq), Gen. Jim \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis (an Iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the U.S. Central Command, who two years ago told a San Diego audience that \u201cit\u2019s fun to shoot people\u201d), George Schultz (the Reagan-era secretary of state who called the Sandinista government in Nicaragua \u201ca cancer in our own land mass\u201d that must be \u201ccut out\u201d) and Karl Eikenberry (a retired Army lieutenant general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan 10 years ago). \\nWith further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academicians\u2014above all the nationalist Texas A&M historian Elizabeth Cobbs ( author of a book on which the documentary is based), \u201cAmerican Umpire\u201d portrays 20th and 21st century U.S. foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish, dangerous and reckless planet (think \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d) that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to U.S. leaders by the nation\u2019s far-seeing Founding Fathers. The only substantive criticism of U.S. foreign policy in \u201cAmerican Umpire\u201d is the complaint, voiced by numerous interview subjects, that America harms itself to the benefit of others (the Europeans above all) by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet. We are just too good for our own good. \\nOur Real Task \\nThere is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes. The omissions are staggering. They range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos resisting U.S. imperial invasion and occupation at the last century\u2019s outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in Haiti and the Dominican Republic after World War I; the unnecessary atom bombing of Hiroshima and, even worse, of Nagasaki (really the first shots of the Cold War ); the toppling of more than 50 governments by U.S. coups and invasions since the end of World War II; the liquidation of perhaps as many as 5 million Southeast Asians in the so-called Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975; the Cold War-era sponsorship of Third World fascism from Chile to South Africa and Indonesia; the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro and numerous CIA-directed terror bombings in socialist Cuba; the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions; the development and sponsorship of Osama bin Laden and other radically arch-reactionary, jihadist Muslim, paramilitary forces to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; the \u201cHighway of Death,\u201d when U.S. warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered Iraqi troops retreating from Iraq in 1991; the coordination and sponsorship of a mass-murderous civil war on peasants, workers and intellectuals (with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands) in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s; the disastrous U.S. invasion of Iraq (responsible for at least 1 million Iraqi deaths); the calamitous U.S. toppling of the Libyan Gadhafi regime; the calamitous destabilization of the Syrian regime; the U.S. funding and encouragement of civil war in central Africa; the enablement and protection of a vicious right-wing coup in Honduras in the spring and summer of 2009; the criminal U.S. global war of terror, replete with rampant \u201ctargeted assassinations,\u201d torture, illegal renditions, endless drone war and special-forces killing operations across the Muslim world and other places as well. \\n\u201cAmerican Umpire\u201d hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of U.S. foreign policy past and present. As numerous key U.S. planning documents reveal over and over, the goal of that policy was to maintain and, if necessary, install governments that \u201cfavor[ed] private investment of domestic and foreign capital, production for export, and the right to bring profits out of the country.\u201d Given the United States\u2019 remarkable possession of half the world\u2019s capital after World War II, Washington elites had no doubt that U.S. investors and corporations would profit the most. Internally, the basic, selfish, national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed. As the \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201cdovish\u201d imperialist, top State Department planner and key Cold War architect George F. Kennan explained in Policy Planning Study 23, a critical 1948 document: \u201cWe have about 50% of the world\u2019s wealth, but only 6.3% of its population. \u2026 In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. \u2026 To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming. ... The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.\u201d \\nThe necessity of dispensing with \u201chuman rights\u201d and other \u201csentimental\u201d and \u201cunreal objectives\u201d was especially pressing in the \u201cglobal south.\u201d Washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic (capitalist) system\u2014Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the energy-rich and thus strategically hypersignificant Middle East\u2014a less than flattering role. It was to \u201cfulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market\u201d ( actual State Department language ) for the great industrial (capitalist) nations (excluding \u201csocialist\u201d Russia and its satellites). It was to be exploited both for the benefit of U.S. corporations/investors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous U.S. trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the Soviet bloc. \\n\u201cDemocracy\u201d was fine as a slogan and benevolent, idealistic-sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core, underlying, ultra-imperialist U.S. policy at home and abroad. Because most people in the \u201cThird World\u201d had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what U.S. intelligence officials considered the heretical \u201cidea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people\u201d (what post-World War II U.S. planners called \u201ccommunism\u201d), Washington\u2019s real-life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified, to say the least. \u201cDemocracy\u201d was suitable to the U.S. as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of U.S. investors/corporations and related U.S. geopolitical objectives. It had to be abandoned, undermined and/or crushed when it threatened those investors/corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree. As President Richard Nixon\u2019s coldblooded National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970, three years before the U.S. sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew Chile\u2019s democratically elected leftist President Salvador Allende, \u201cI don\u2019t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people.\u201d \\nThe selfish imperial cynicism of U.S. foreign policy continues to this day, into the post-Cold War and post-9/11 era. As leading Dutch political scientists Bastiaann van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff write in their important new volume , \u201cAmerican Grand Strategy and Corporate Elite Networks: The Open Door Since the End of the Cold War,\u201d \u201cFrom the end of the 19th nineteenth century onward, American grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open, \u201cfree\u201d markets, to which global capital\u2014and, above all, U.S. transnational capital\u2014has full access. \u2026 The global Open Door has continued to define the ends of the American grand strategy throughout the post-Cold War era.\u201d Because\u2014as during and before\u2014the Cold War\u2019s end, Washington\u2019s commitment to \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201chuman rights\u201d is conditional and hypocritical: The noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the free-market hegemony of global and especially U.S. transnational capital. They are dispensed with, even as U.S. policymakers trumpet them, when they do not.'"}, "time": 1742563730.949055}
