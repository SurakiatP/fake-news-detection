Trump out of the Oval Office: \\nElect, then impeach. \\nThat\u2019s their big plan. Elect Trump as president of the United States, then turn around and have him impeached, tried and booted from office, leaving us with a much more palatable Mike Pence as President. \\nOur friends at The Federalist first floated this idea Tuesday and while they acknowledge it\u2019s a near impossibility, it shows just how desperate they are to keep Mr. Trump from the White House. \\nThere is a way out of this mess. It is a desperate plan, but desperate times, desperate measures: Elect-and-Impeach. Elect the ticket. Impeach Trump. \\nThe Republican Party does have an attractive candidate on its ticket. Socially conservative. Economically conservative. Conservative on national defense. Morally and religiously impeccable. The trouble is, that man is the Republican candidate for vice president, Mike Pence. \\nBut if Trump were impeached immediately after he took office, the Republican candidate for vice president would become president in his place. Further, if Republicans take the lead in removing Trump from office, the party might regain some of its lost credibility in parts of the electorate that it is anxious to attract. \\nJonathan Asbach , who is a PhD student at the prestigious Hillsdale College, thinks that while this would be a difficult plan, it\u2019s not impossible. The GOP is at odds with its own nominee. If enough of them are willing to cross party lines to vote for impeachment, it could be done. \\nThen there\u2019s the problem of what to charge Trump with. He must be guilty of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d according to the Constitution. Asbach argues that \u201cif Trump is half as corrupt as we have been told, surely some charge could be made to stick\u2014especially if the recent allegations of sexual assault prove to be more than empty propaganda.\u201d \\nElect-and-Impeach offers conservatives precisely what they want: A solid conservative president far better than either of the two major-party candidates. He\u2019s far better, for that matter, than either of the two leading third-party candidates who have attracted attention as magnets for protest votes. \\nThere are two steps for this to actually happen, he writes. First, the GOP would have to grow a spine. \u201cRepublican congressmen and senators must pledge to take on the unsavory job of impeaching their own candidate the moment he becomes president,\u201d Asbach writes. \u201cAs this is by far the least-bad option that Republican leaders have, they should be willing to step up to the plate. \\nSecond, all the GOP voters who have abandoned the party because of Trump would have to return to the flock, actually vote for the candidate knowing that \u201cit is not really him you are voting for, then\u2026 lobby your senator and congressman to do their part and remove Trump from the head of it.\u201d \\nThere is a potential for dawn after the dark night of the 2016 electoral season. There is a very real possible future in which Pence is the president of the United States, in which the country is in safe, responsible, conservative hands. It would also be one in which the Supreme Court is saved from the lawless ruffians who want to rewrite the Constitution as they see fit. \\nBut for that future to be realized, Republicans have to work together, and they have to do so quickly. Inertia is our greatest obstacle. This has never been done before. That makes it seem like it cannot be done. But America cannot afford our complacency. This is our last chance to prevent impending electoral catastrophe. \\nSo this is a plea to conservative leaders and conservative voters: Do your part. Make the pledge. Cast the vote. Help make Elect-and-Impeach a reality. \\nJust when I thought the #NeverTrumpers had quieted down, they come up with this plan. \\nI have to hand it to them \u2013 it\u2019s certainly different . \\nIt will never, ever, work. But it shows the complete desperation that some folks have about the prospect of Donald Trump as president of the United States.'"}, "time": 1742564592.2880778}
