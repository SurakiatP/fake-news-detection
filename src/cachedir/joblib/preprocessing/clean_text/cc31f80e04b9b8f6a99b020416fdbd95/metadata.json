It traveled to the legitimizing megaphone of   cable news. And it ended, after an agonizing journey through the new realities of the campaign media, with a single phone call that debunked its entire existence. There was no syringe. Along the way, the syringe that wasn\u2019t revealed everything there is to know about the truth, the media and this   presidential campaign. On the latest episode of The   we explore what happened to truth in this campaign and who\u2019s to blame for the new world of   and outright falsehoods. Our guides: Jim Rutenberg, The Times\u2019s media columnist, who figured out what the syringe really was and exposed the hidden connections that fanned the original, inaccurate reporting Charlie Sykes, an influential conservative radio show host who has sounded the alarm about the partisan warfare that has left us with no referees who can separate fact from fiction and Sarah Ellison, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, who has presciently reported on the possibility that Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign may be evolving into a media empire. Mr. Sykes, who says he stands by much of his critique of the mainstream media, now concedes that years of relentlessly bashing it have left the country without any trusted sources of information. \u201cAs a conservative talk show host, one of our themes has always been to bash the mainstream media, to point out the bias,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is the moment you wake up and you go, O. K. have we done such an effective job that when I say, for example, \u2018What Donald Trump said here is demonstrably false and here is the   from The New York Times or The Washington Post\u2019  \u2014   we now have an audience that is conditioned to say, \u2018Well, you know, that\u2019s the mainstream media, that is the liberal media, I\u2019m not going to take that seriously.\u2019 \u201d The result, he said, is a country in which there are no final arbiters of truth. \u201cYou begin to realize you\u2019ve basically cut down all of these guideposts to be able to say, \u2018Look this is what is reliable, this is what is not reliable,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sykes said. Or as Mr. Rutenberg put it: in this new world, \u201cTruth is absolutely relative. There\u2019s no platonic form of truth. \u201d From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.
