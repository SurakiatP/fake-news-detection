[\u201cThe foundation is still grappling with its place in the era of President Trump,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cIt faces some daunting challenges: a drop in   during the campaign uncertainty about the scale of the former president\u2019s ambitions and questions about leadership, including how long its president, Donna E. Shalala, will stay, and whether Mrs. Clinton might rejoin the charity. \u201d  Shalala didn\u2019t shy away from the foundation\u2019s fledgling philanthropic status. \u201cLast year was a tough year,\u201d she told the Times, \u201cbecause people were beating on us with nonsense,\u201d referencing the media reports of corruption between Clinton Foundation donors, the   speeches given by Bill Clinton, and the corresponding actions approved by the U. S. State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Indeed, mere weeks after Hillary Clinton lost the election, financial disclosure forms revealed that the Clinton Foundation\u2019s donations had plummeted by 37 percent. Reports earlier this month about the foundation laying off   staffers has ballooned to \u201cabout 100,\u201d the Times reports. Much of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s shady dealings around the world while Hillary Clinton was head of the State Department was brought to light through the investigative work of Breitbart News and its    Peter Schweizer\u2019s bestselling book Clinton Cash.  What\u2019s more, the Times reports, \u201cFoundation officials confirmed on Thursday that two major programs, including one in Haiti, would transfer out of the foundation. \u201d And according to Congressman Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, the investigation into the Clinton Foundation \u201ccontinues. \u201d Nevertheless, Shalala, who served as secretary of health and human services under President Clinton, says the Clinton global charity\u2019s best days are ahead. \u201cAt the end of the day, I think this is going to be as it always was: a creative, dynamic foundation that helps to improve the lives of millions,\u201d she said. Still, experts don\u2019t share the same optimistic view about the Clinton Foundation\u2019s future as its leadership. \u201cThe big issue they are going to face is to what degree can they raise money now that the Clintons seem to be out of national leadership positions,\u201d said Leslie Lenkowsky, a philanthropy expert at Indiana University. \u201cThey have lost a little bit of their luster. \u201d The organization\u2019s namesake, Bill Clinton, is now    and has been out of government for over 15 years. The foundation\u2019s fundraising, which Mr. Clinton spearheaded since 2001, has nosedived in recent years. And, according to Ms. Shalala, the 2016 fundraising numbers are lower than the year before, which were lower than the year before that. Ms. Shalala, however, expresses faith in the former president\u2019s ability to still raise large donations. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of friends,\u201d Ms. Shalala said. Asked if Hillary Clinton is ready take on a more concerted leadership role in her family\u2019s foundation, Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, told the Times \u201cWe are not there yet even remotely now. \u201d Daniel F. Runde, a former director of the Office of Global Development Alliances at the United States Agency for International Development described the Clinton Foundation\u2019s viability bluntly: \u201cIt\u2019s a damaged brand, but there remains an international demand for them. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742563963.4500911}
