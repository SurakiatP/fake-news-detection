To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and related to nutrition. According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published, the Global Burden of Disease study, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the number one cause of death in the United States, and the number one cause of disability in this country, is our diet\u2014which has bumped tobacco smoking to number two. Smoking now only kills about a half million Americans every year, whereas our diet now kills hundreds of thousands more. So, if most death and disability is preventable, and related to nutrition, then obviously, nutrition is the number one thing taught in medical school; right? It\u2019s the number one thing your doctor talks to you about. How could there be such a disconnect between the science, and the practice, of medicine? Let\u2019s do a thought experiment. Imagine yourself a smoker back in the 1950s. The average per capita cigarette consumption was about 4,000 cigarettes a year. Think about that. In the 1950s, the average person walking around smoked a half pack a day. The media was telling you to smoke. Famous athletes agreed. Even Santa Claus cared enough about your throat to want you to smoke. I mean, you want to keep fit, and stay slender; so, you make sure to smoke. And eat lots of hot dogs to keep trim, and lots of sugar to stay slim and trim\u2014a lot less fattening than that apple there. I mean, sheesh. Though apples do \u201cconnote goodness and freshness,\u201d reads one internal tobacco industry memo, which brings up many possibilities for making \u201cyouth-oriented\u201d cigarettes. They wanted to make apple-flavored cigarettes for kids. In addition to staying fit and slender, and soothing your throat, \u201cFor digestion\u2019s sake,\u201d you smoke. I mean, \u201cNo curative power is claimed for [by] Philip Morris\u2014but [hey], an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d Better be safe than sorry, and smoke. Like eating, smoking was a family affair. \u201cGee, Mommy, you sure enjoy your Marlboro! You\u2019re darn tootin\u2019. Just one question, Mom: can you afford not to smoke Marlboros?\u201d In the 1950s, your kids were giving you cigarettes. Even your dog was giving you cigarettes. \u201cBlow in her face and she\u2019ll follow you anywhere.\u201d\u201cNo woman ever says no.\u201d They\u2019re \u201cso round, so firm, so fully packed.\u201d After all, John Wayne smoked them (until he got lung cancer and died). Back then, even the Paleo folks were smoking, and so were the doctors. Now, this is not to say there wasn\u2019t controversy within the medical profession. Yes, some doctors smoked Camels, but other physicians preferred Luckies. So, there was some disagreement. \u201cEminent doctors, on high and impartial medical authority, call for Philip Morris.\u201d Even the specialists couldn\u2019t agree which cigarette was better for your throat. So, best to stick to the science. And, more scientists smoke this brand. This should not be rocket science\u2014but even the rocket scientists had their favorite: for \u201cthe man who thinks for himself.\u201d We know why the AMA may have been sucking up to the tobacco industry, refusing to endorse the Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking, after they were handed a ten million dollar check from the tobacco industry. But, why weren\u2019t more individual doctors speaking out? Well, there were a few gallant souls ahead of their time, writing in, as there are today, standing up against industries killing millions. But, why not more? Maybe, it\u2019s because the majority of physicians themselves smoked cigarettes\u2014just like the majority of physicians today continue to eat foods that are contributing to our epidemics of dietary diseases. What was the AMA\u2019s rallying cry back then? Everything in moderation. Extensive scientific studies have proven \u201csmoking in moderation\u201d\u2014oh, that\u2019s fine. Sound familiar? Eating the Standard American Diet today is like being a smoker back in the 1950s. Most everyone you know eats this way. It\u2019s normal\u2014it\u2019s what they feed people in hospitals, for gosh sake. But, you don\u2019t have to wait until society catches up with the science again. Sometimes, it takes a whole generation for things to change in medicine. The old guard of smoking physicians and medical school professors die off, and a new generation takes its place. But how many patients need to die in the interim? Please consider volunteering to help out on the site. Close Sources Video Sources vegetarians Doctor's Note \\nIn this video, I try to answer the question that surely must occur to anyone even dipping their toes into the lifestyle medicine literature: \u201cWait a second, if this were true, why didn\u2019t my doctor tell me?\u201d If, for example, our #1 killer can be reversed through diet, why isn\u2019t it front page news, taught to every medical student, broadcast from every mountaintop by medical organizations and government dietary guidelines? Still confused? Check out my other videos that address these questions: \\nIs the risk of smoking and the Standard American Diet really comparable, though?

Gatherer \\nWhen Dr Greger isn\u2019t limited to a short video he can make his points even more obvious! For a longer version of the content in today\u2019s video see the last part of \u201cFood as Medicine: Preventing and Treating the Most Dreaded Diseases with Diet\u201d. Start at 54:46 and go to 1:12:20. I love the quotes by Dr Neal Barnard and Dr Kim Williams near the end. Plantstrongdoc M.D. \\nThe only thing I remember from medschool regarding nutrition was my professor in cardiology saying that it is impossible to bring down the cholesterol with diet alone, you need medication, and my professor in haematology saying that it is probably healthy to be a vegetarian, but you will surely develop anaemia, and them I remember a very skilled cardiologist who inhaled huge amounts of cake between the angiograms, not to mention the child oncologist who was a heavy smoker, wrinkled in his face like a raisin and his skin had a slightly yellow tone. When I was an intern, one of my collegues brought his own dinner \u2013 chips and coke. Regarding nutrition: DONT LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR! The chance that he or she on the field of nutrition is an ignorant is probably near 100% plant_this_thought \\nThe interns at the hospital I used to work at were always boasting about how little sleep they got, how crappy their diet was, etc., competing to show how much they could abuse their own bodies, as if this somehow showed their commitment to the profession of helping others to get well. lemonhead \\nI\u2019ve always wondered if, due to the harsh conditions of medical training, there\u2019s selection for particularly physically robust people and that they would, perhaps, be less sympathetic to people prone to illness having not experienced such states themselves. Ryan \\nEven if they taught more nutrition in medical school it wouldn\u2019t help much if they keep using the current batch of nutrition textbooks. I\u2019m in college for nursing right now and they\u2019re covering nutrition in my class *right now* and I\u2019m having to tune it out to keep myself from interrupting class on how dangerous and outdated the information they\u2019re teaching is. \\nMeat and dairy is being referenced as safe and nutritious food. There is hardly mention of how diet impacts health other than preventing deficiencies and obesity. Vegans are lumped in with vegetarians and are only mentioned because of the risk of b12 and vitamin D deficit. I can go on and on\u2026 it\u2019s infuriating. \\nI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s more frustrating that a whole generation of new nurses is being prejudiced against a whole plant foods diet or that the professors who say \u2018evidence-based practice\u2019 in every other breath won\u2019t bother changing the curricula to match the science. Plantstrongdoc M.D. \\nGood point. Places where nutrition is taught, it is not exactly Greger, Esselstyn, McDougall, Klaper they refer to.\u201cMeat and dairy is being referenced as safe and nutritious food\u201d\u2013 OK there is still a long way.\u201cnutritional deficiencies (probably referring to vitamin and minerals) \u2013 which century does the teachers come from? :-) Ryan \\nWell the one professor jokes that she used to work with Florence Nightingale\u2026 Betsy \\nI\u2019ve been eating about 97% vegan for 8 years or so based on the writings of the docs you mentioned, but now I\u2019m very confused because docs like Mark Hyman who is well respected in the functional medicine field and works at the Cleveland Clinic, studies showing to eat more fat \u2013 granted its fat like avocado/coconut oil and he says not to eat it with unhealthy carbs, but his talks with other professionals on his Fat Summits don\u2019t seem to be in alignment with the docs you mentioned. In fact I know Dr. Esselstyn thinks all oils are a waste of calories. Mark said on one of the videos that his LDL has gone way up from eating so much coconut oil, but these folks are citing studies too. It\u2019s very confusing. Thea \\nBetsy: . When all is said and done, Hyman is citing studies, but he is misleading people in various ways when he does it. VegCoach found the following 4 minute video about one of Mark Hyman\u2019s claims that demonstrates my point. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RovJRlTbsgw&feature=youtu.be . Also, the following post from Tom Goff looks into some of the other of Hyman\u2019s claims. http://nutritionfacts.org/2016/03/22/the-effects-of-dietary-cholesterol-on-blood-cholesterol/#comment-2584872026 . I agree that it *is* terribly confusing for most people. It really frustrates me that a lack of integrity and basic human decency is affecting the very lives of so many people. Jean \\nAm I the only one that at 100% volume can barely hear this video? Thea \\nJean: The volume is working fine for me and no one else has mentioned the volume as being an issue. . I\u2019m not sure if this will be worth it to you or not, but you might narrow down the issue by trying other recent videos on this site to see if you experience the same problem and then try a video or two on a different browser. Maybe whatever you find out with these experiments will help you narrow down the problem??? . Sorry I don\u2019t have anything more concrete for you. John \\nI did have to turn it up in order to hear all the words on a technical subject. John S docbeccy \\nI agree! When Dr. Hyman\u2019s book on the sugar solution came out I got a free advance excerpt. I was stunned to see he recommended BACON!! I tried to engage in a dialogue as to why he thought a high fat, nitrate laden, version of cured meat belonged in anyone\u2019s diet but I never got a response. When I visited the Canyon Ranch Spa this summer and spoke with their medical director he was very sad that one of their former medical directors was clearly less interested in patient health than other priorities. One needs to be judicious as we wade through the conflicting experts. Thea \\ndocbeccy: Thank you for your reply. That\u2019s some interesting insight. . re: \u201c\u2026wade through conflicting experts.\u201d One of the biggest mistakes I see people making is along the lines of false equivalencies. I see it all the time here on NutritionFacts. \u201cYou say this, but these other people say something else and they have valid points too.\u201d There are times when a \u201cside\u201d is not equally valid. If you give equal weight to all sides without having the ability to filter (as most people do not when it comes to nutrition), then you can end up confused and/or finding a balance between two view points which is not actually reasonable/balanced/based on the evidence. . I wish there was a way to help people see through this, but I don\u2019t think there is at this time. People are just massively confused, often invested in that confusion, and I don\u2019t judge them. It is tough! At some point, I think the situation will be like the smoking issue and everyone will just get it instinctively, because like the smoking issue at some point the science (and noticing the health of WFPB eaters long term) will win out. In the mean time, we can do our part to help by continuing to volunteer on NutritionFacts. :-) Plantstrongdoc M.D. \\nWell \u2013 I think it is important to look at the big lines, because there are small differences between what these great docs (and others) recommend. E.g. McDougall is very fond of starches and has nothing against a little salt, Furhmann is very fond of beans and vegetables, for some a little processed oil is OK, For Ornish small amounts of egg white is OK and so on. Common to them is they recommend a mostly vegan diet \u2013 I think that is the important point John \\nHi Betsy, I have been saying this for a long time. You\u2019ll never see this here, but other scientists critique Dr. Greger\u2019s finding the same way as Thea does about Dr. Hyman below. I just try to listen to all of them that seem to have substance and sift them through my own filter. John S Thea \\nJohn S: Did you watch that 4 minute video? I\u2019ve never seen Dr. Greger make a claim about a study where the study actually says the very opposite of Dr. Greger\u2019s claim\u2013not the way that Dr. Hyman did. I highly recommend watching that 4 minute video. John \\nYes, I did watch the 4 minute video. I also saw the Klaper video. I was only allowed to see the viewpoint of the person making the video, and he wasn\u2019t honest about what Dr. Hyman actually said. Hyman was talking about calories burned by people when they ate different things,and the video never addressed the issue that Hyman brought up. John S Thea \\nJohn: FYI: I looked into this video in the past. I went to Hyman\u2019s site and I read his claims and then examined the claims in the video. I do not remember see any discrepancies. Anyway, glad you got to see the video. . Note, I did not reference a Dr. Klaper video in the above post. I don\u2019t know what you are referring to. Kwarya \\nWas just telling MY nursing professor the same sort of thing today when our book and her lecture were touting certain foods, most if which fall in the \u201canimal products\u201d category! There is never a single reference in my nursing books to a healthier lifestyle other than going \u201clow fat\u201d (with the SAD). Misterimpatient \\nFor the record, John Wayne died of stomach cancer (1979) not lung cancer. He had a lung removed in 1964 due to lung cancer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne Plantstrongdoc M.D. \\nSmokers also have an increased risk of stomach cancer. Misterimpatient \\nThank you. I understand that. The video says he died of lung cancer, which is not correct. Rhombopterix \\nhe got lung cancer: true and he died: true \\nhow does your comment help us? Misterimpatient \\nIf there is one thing we count on from nutritionfacts.org it is accurate information. Go to 3:10 in the video and consider the content \u201c\u2026until he got lung cancer and died.\u201d An honest listener will hear this and think that lung cancer was the cause of death. In fact, stomach cancer was the cause of death in very source I found. \\nSo how does my comment help? It attempts, without contempt for others, to correct verifiably incorrect information in the video. Thea \\nMisterimpatient: I will pass this onto staff. Todd \\nGood point. Attention to detail is important on a site like this. It\u2019s possible, I suppose, that the stomach cancer that took John Wayne\u2019s life was a metastasis of the original lung cancer, in which case the original cancer would be cited as the cause of death. But unless we know that for sure, it\u2019s not a good idea to state that he died of lung cancer. Plantstrongdoc M.D. \\nTypically lung cancer spread to the brain, bone or liver. Tired of War \\nWhile Wayne\u2019s 6 pack-a-day cigarette habit might have had something to do with his death, I\u2019m pretty sure that the ultimate reason for his demise was his role as Genghis Khan, in the movie, \u201cThe Conqueror.\u201d The film was shot downwind from active, above ground, nuclear bomb testing sites, in 1956, and quite a few of those involved in the filming succumbed to cancer in the years that followed. I fear that there are some historical personalities that one should portray, with great caution. Misterimpatient \\nWell played. Very well played indeed. George \\nI don\u2019t know about you, but there is a certain amount of people for whom the truth is important. And also there are people (like our host) how ask others to point out eventual mistakes in their work. Unless you have a hostile relationship with the truth, Misterimpatient\u2019s comment should help you, too. Colonel Forbin \\nSick world we live in. Robbin \\nI think back then tobacco companies were paying off everyone now pharmaceutical companies are paying off everyone. Maybe a lot of doctors smoked back in the day, but I think a lot of doctors like their pills today. There is no money in gardening, but there is in pill popping. I think sometimes it would be easier just to eat like everyone else, then I remember I don\u2019t want to feel like sh*t like everyone, or be on medications like everyone. Blair Rollin \\nIt sure would be a lot easier. I do a whole lotta kitchen time since we switched to WFPB. But then again, I\u2019m passing most people even 30 years younger than me out on the trail. And I can stand to look in the mirror. Ellen Mulcrone \\nHello, \\nI was wondering if anyone knew how to treat Lichen Sclerosus with diet, and if anyone had found any scientific based evidence to support this? I can\u2019t find anything on the site. \\nThanks!\""}, "time": 1742563210.3678267}
