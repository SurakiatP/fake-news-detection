She does not dare get too comfortable, a symptom of her years of homelessness. Ms. Ferrer, 33, is a single mother of five sons. All of them have spent portions of their childhoods in New York City\u2019s shelter system. What made the experience even worse, Ms. Ferrer said, was that her three youngest children  \u2014   Aiden Soto, 3 Angel Soto, 7 and Justin Ferrer, 8  \u2014   are autistic. They also have   disorder and anxiety disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard and it\u2019s stressful and it hurts. Not only for me to live that life but to see the children living that life and to know you\u2019re not stable. \u201d Last year, she made a successful bid for affordable housing in the Bronx. But in her haste to move, she signed the rental agreement without proper due diligence. The apartment flooded every time it rained. Mold grew on the walls. The heat did not work. Insulation was shoddy. Bugs wiggled up through broken floorboards, traumatizing Justin, who has an insect phobia. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that in my life, and I lived in shelters,\u201d Ms. Ferrer said. \u201cAnimals were coming in and my kids, my children, are sleeping, getting bit by ants. \u201d This summer, with the help of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times\u2019s Neediest Cases Fund, the family moved into a safer, cleaner home in the Bronx. Drawing from the Neediest funds, Catholic Charities also provided $321 in school clothes for the children. Despite escaping the gloomy shelters and crumbling apartments, a steady beat of chaos remains. On a recent afternoon at the family\u2019s apartment, her sons\u2019 mercurial temperaments were on display. They slammed doors and shouted and wailed in constant fits. Glass trinkets were removed from a coffee table and placed in a less precarious spot. One of her sons repeatedly threw a water bottle around the living room. Another snatched a tablet from his brother as he was watching a video. \u201cGod must be giving me the strength, because I don\u2019t know where a woman like me can have so much patience,\u201d Ms. Ferrer said. Her oldest children, Matthew Ferrer, 18, and Javon Murphy, 13, do their part to corral and calm their younger siblings. Ms. Ferrer speaks glowingly about Matthew in particular. He is rarely home, often working a   job to keep the house afloat. Her pride is coupled with guilt. \u201cHe\u2019s young, he doesn\u2019t have any children,\u201d she said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be having to deal with that. \u201d Ms. Ferrer is responsible for paying the roughly $1, 000 monthly rent. She receives $1, 486 every month in Social Security disability benefits for her three youngest children, $270 in food stamps and $300 that Matthew pitches in from his job. She does not receive child support from her children\u2019s fathers, and because of her autistic sons\u2019 care requirements, she has not worked in more than eight years, since shortly before Justin was born. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see myself the way I\u2019m seeing myself, struggling so much,\u201d she said. The family\u2019s tight finances are a steady source of anxiety for Ms. Ferrer, who worries her family may once again be without a home. As long as she has one, she is meticulous about keeping it pristine. She said she simply cannot tolerate dirty things. Each morning, she races to get her four   children ready. They all attend different schools, riding different buses that arrive at different times. She does it all alone. The children\u2019s fathers cannot be relied on, Ms. Ferrer said, and although she has many family members nearby, they do not help. \u201cYou would think, having such a big family, that we\u2019d be together but we\u2019re not,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in their own world. \u201d Her stress is visible. Large clumps of her hair have fallen out. She has cut her hair short to make it less noticeable. Her knees and legs ache from spending long hours on her feet, and she has begun to have panic attacks. \u201cI might look 33, but I\u2019ll tell you one thing, inside my body, I don\u2019t feel 33,\u201d said Ms. Ferrer. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m 70 years old. \u201d She dreams of going on vacation, even for a day or two, but she knows it will not be reality. Instead, respite comes in short doses at the end of the day. When her children are in bed, she showers, reflects and thanks God for giving her and her family another day. \u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d Ms. Ferrer said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll get up at five in the morning, and do this all over again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562277.8732884}
