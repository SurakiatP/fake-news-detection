Trump\u2019s first news conference as   was a raucous, chaotic affair on Wednesday  \u2014   and it was  \u2014   the parody of it on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d was somehow calmer and more organized than the actual event. Still, the \u201cS. N. L. \u201d sketch pulled few punches as it swung at the show\u2019s most powerful, persistent critic, mocking Mr. Trump on a range of subjects, including the perceived lack of star power at his coming inauguration his opaque plan to divest himself from his businesses and the possibility that Russia possessed unverified compromising information on him. Saturday night\u2019s episode, the first new one of 2017, once again featured Alec Baldwin as Mr. Trump. He started off the faux news conference by vowing to answer what he said was \u201cthe question that\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind. \u201d \u201cYes, this is real life,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really happening. On January 20, I, Donald J. Trump, will become the 45th president of the United States. \u201d He continued: \u201cAnd then, two months later, Mike Pence will become the 46th. \u201d Listing the performers who are scheduled for his inauguration, he cited the rock band 3 Doors Down, \u201cJackie What\u2019  \u201d from \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d and \u201cthe one Rockette with the least money in her savings. \u201d (He also said the actors Angelina Jolie, Ryan Gosling and Jennifer Lawrence would be in attendance \u201ccourtesy of Madame Tussauds. \u201d) Turning to questions from reporters played by the \u201cS. N. L. \u201d cast, Mr.    pointedly refused to answer questions about an alleged compromising videotape, because, he said, \u201cit didn\u2019t happen and it wasn\u2019t as cool as it sounded. \u201d Asked by a reporter played by Sasheer Zamata how he planned to repeal and replace Obamacare, Mr. Baldwin said, \u201cI actually do have a replacement plan, O. K.? I just read about it this week. It\u2019s a terrific plan. Just great. It\u2019s called the Affordable Care Act. \u201d When Ms. Zamata\u2019s character said that repealing Obamacare meant that people could die, Mr. Baldwin replied, \u201cListen, sweetheart, I\u2019m about to be president, we\u2019re all going to die. \u201d As the   Mr. Baldwin went on to say that he was turning his companies over to his sons, \u201cBeavis and  . \u201d (\u201cYou can tell they\u2019re good businessmen because of how   their hair is,\u201d he said.) Recreating another scene from the news conference, the \u201cS. N. L. \u201d cast member Cecily Strong appeared as Sheri A. Dillon, a tax lawyer for Mr. Trump who spoke at the actual news conference. In a low monotone, Ms. Strong motioned toward a large pile of   papers in various folders that she said proved Mr. Trump was divesting from his companies. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t divesting, how could there be so many damn papers?\u201d she said. The \u201cS. N. L. \u201d sketch repeated Mr. Trump\u2019s angry repudiation of the news media organization BuzzFeed, which he called \u201ca failing pile of garbage. \u201d (In the sketch, Mr. Baldwin said he was dissatisfied with the results of a BuzzFeed quiz. \u201cI\u2019m not a Joey, I\u2019m a Rachel,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201cFriends\u201d characters.) There was also a gentle reenactment of Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to take questions from the CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta. \u201cYou\u2019re fake news,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said in the sketch. \u201cI tried to watch your network last night, and there was just some crazy blond woman spouting lies. \u201d Bobby Moynihan, playing Mr. Acosta, answered: \u201cThat was Kellyanne Conway. \u201d Finally, after acknowledging to a reporter that Russia probably played a role in hacking the election, Mr. Baldwin took one last question from the cast member Beck Bennett. Though the   Mr. Bennett clearly appeared to be playing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, he said, in a thick Russian accent, \u201cI am American journalist Wolf Blitzer. Are you sure Russia was behind hacking?\u201d Then he held up a potentially incriminating videotape and asked, \u201cBut are you really, really sure?\u201d Mr. Baldwin stammered in reply, \u201cIt was China. I mean Canada. It was Meryl Streep. \u201d Ever since Mr. Trump hosted the program in November 2015 while still vying for the Republican presidential nomination, he has made no secret of his dislike for how \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and Mr. Baldwin have portrayed him. After some sketches this season, Mr. Trump has gone on his Twitter account to air his grievances, writing, for example, that the show is \u201cunwatchable,\u201d \u201ctotally biased\u201d and \u201cnot funny,\u201d and that Mr. Baldwin\u2019s impersonation of him \u201cjust can\u2019t get any worse. \u201d At other times, Mr. Trump has not responded to the show. During Saturday\u2019s opening monologue, Tina Fey, the \u201cS. N. L. \u201d alumna and \u201c30 Rock\u201d star, offered some advice to the actress Felicity Jones, a   guest host. No matter how the show goes, Ms. Fey said, \u201cThe president of the United States will say that it\u2019s sad and overrated. \u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, no one cares. \u201d And then TV viewers warily turned their eyes to Twitter to see what, if anything, would happen next. Late Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump did respond with a tweet critical of the show, caling it \u201cthe worst of NBC,\u201d adding, \u201cReally bad television!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561880.4888518}
