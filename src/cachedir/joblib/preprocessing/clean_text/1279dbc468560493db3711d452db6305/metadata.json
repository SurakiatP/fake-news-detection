The court struck down a rule issued by the Obama administration that barred the sale of such insurance as a separate   product. \u201cDisagreeing with Congress\u2019s expressly codified policy choices isn\u2019t a luxury administrative agencies enjoy,\u201d the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said on Friday in a decision that criticized \u201cadministrative overreach\u201d by the Department of Health and Human Services. At issue is a type of insurance that pays consumers a fixed dollar amount, such as $500 a day for hospital care or $50 for a doctor\u2019s visit, regardless of how much is actually owed to the provider. Such \u201cfixed indemnity\u201d insurance is normally less comprehensive and less expensive than the \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d required by the Affordable Care Act. Under the rule, issued by the Obama administration in 2014, fixed indemnity policies could be sold only to people who already have the more comprehensive coverage that meets detailed federal standards. State officials and insurers estimate that as many as four million people might have fixed indemnity policies without major medical coverage. The Obama administration gave several reasons for cracking down on fixed indemnity insurance. It is \u201can inadequate substitute for major medical coverage\u201d because \u201cit does not provide protection against major medical expenses,\u201d the administration said. Moreover, it said, consumers may be confused and may buy fixed indemnity insurance in \u201cthe mistaken belief that it provides comprehensive coverage\u201d  \u2014   a concern also voiced by consumer groups. In adopting the final rule in 2014, the Obama administration said that allowing people to buy   fixed indemnity insurance would undermine the goal of \u201cmaximizing the number of individuals who have comprehensive, major medical coverage. \u201d Since 1996, fixed indemnity insurance has generally been exempt from federal insurance standards, and the Affordable Care Act did not change that, nor did Congress \u201cgive even the slightest indication\u201d that it meant to alter the exemption, the appeals court said. But, the court said, the administration \u201ceffectively eliminated   fixed indemnity plans altogether,\u201d by tacking \u201cadditional criteria\u201d onto the 1996 law. The ruling in the case, Central United Life Insurance v. Burwell, was issued by a panel composed of Judges Janice Rogers Brown, Patricia A. Millett and Douglas H. Ginsburg. Fixed indemnity insurance differs from major medical coverage in many ways. It does not have to provide the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d required by the Affordable Care Act, nor does it have to pay any specific percentage of medical costs. Some fixed indemnity policies provide coverage only for specified diseases, like cancer. In general, consumers have fewer protections. Under the rule issued by the Obama administration, fixed indemnity insurance would be allowed only as a supplement to major medical coverage that complied with the 2010 health care law. People buying the more limited coverage would have to attest, in their applications, that they already had \u201cminimum essential coverage. \u201d The plaintiffs in the case, who sell fixed indemnity insurance, said the federal rule would essentially destroy the market for such products. \u201cEven after the Affordable Care Act,   consumers may not be able to afford major medical coverage,\u201d said Quin M. Sorenson, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who represented the plaintiffs. In states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility, he said, three million people fall into a coverage gap: They make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to qualify for subsidies in the public insurance marketplace, and they cannot afford major medical coverage on their own. For some of them, he said, fixed indemnity insurance plans may be a valuable option. Under the Affordable Care Act, people who go without major medical coverage may be subject to tax penalties. In a     brief, Wisconsin and 10 other states said that some consumers had found they could save money by buying fixed indemnity insurance and paying the tax penalty. \u201cFixed indemnity insurance is a rational choice for these individuals because it provides meaningful access to the health care system,\u201d the states\u2019 brief said. The appeals court upheld an earlier decision by Judge Royce C. Lamberth of Federal District Court, who said the Obama administration\u2019s rule \u201chas no basis in the statutory text it purports to interpret and plainly exceeds the scope of the statute. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628585.780481}
