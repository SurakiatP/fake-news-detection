Since that final touchdown the hash tag #NotMySuperBowlChamps and other similar tags have been trending. [The   sports media has been out for blood for the better part of a year because Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick, and team owner Robert Kraft all came out as unapologetic fans of President Trump. And, now that they\u2019ve won the Super Bowl the left has turned apoplectic.  Since last night\u2019s big game, liberals have flooded Twitter, Facebook, and other social media services with several versions of the hash tag after Trump pal Tom Brady led his team to yet another Super Bowl title. Along with #NotMySuperBowlChamps, users also employed #NotMySuperBowlChampions and #NotMySuperBowlTeam to attack the Patriots. The winner should be determined by who has more fans, not more points. Winning is racist and Tom Brady is a fascist. #NotMySuperBowlChamps pic. twitter.   \u2014   Elizabeth\u00ae (@MissLizzyNJ) February 6, 2017,  *weeps* I can\u2019t believe this can happen in our country ya\u2019ll *snot bubble* @MileyCyrus #NotMySuperBowlChamps pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jendetta\u00a9 reeeeee! \u2744\ufe0f (@PolitiKellyRite) February 6, 2017,  I\u2019m protesting #notmysuperbowlchampion,  \u2014   Chance Bishop (@THEchancebishop) February 6, 2017,  The Patriots didn\u2019t win today.
