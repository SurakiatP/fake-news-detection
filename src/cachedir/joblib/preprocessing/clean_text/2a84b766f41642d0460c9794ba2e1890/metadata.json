The first time was definitely a mistake. The second time is not so clear. First, NBC\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, taking her first turn at Golden Globes reporting, presumably meant to ask Pharrell Williams about his best original score nomination for \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d a movie about three black women who would play crucial roles in the American space program. Surely she didn\u2019t mean to ask him about \u201cFences,\u201d a similarly renowned film starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. Mr. Williams had no involvement in that. But: Mr. Williams\u2019s   reaction, in which he appeared to be doing his best to hold back whatever he badly wished to say, was impressive in its restraint. Unsurprisingly, the immediate reaction on Twitter was less restrained. \u201cSo Jenna Bush is just merging all of the black movies tonight at the #GoldenGlobes, huh?\u201d one user asked. \u201cPharrell\u2019s face just held hundreds of years of whitewashing resolve,\u201d another said. Others had fun in similarly inventing new movie titles. That seemed to be the end of things, but for some reason, Michael Keaton also referred to \u201cHidden Fences\u201d when listing the nominees for best supporting actress in a motion picture. Since the camera was focused on the actresses, it\u2019s unclear if Mr. Keaton said it with a wink and a nod.'"}, "time": 1742563045.965193}
