Dobson, one of America\u2019s leading evangelicals, who said Mr. Trump had recently come \u201cto accept a relationship with Christ\u201d and was now \u201ca baby Christian. \u201d Dr. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family and one of the country\u2019s most prominent social conservatives, gave his account at a meeting Mr. Trump had in New York on Tuesday with hundreds of Christian conservatives. In an interview recorded at the event by a Pennsylvania pastor, the Rev. Michael Anthony, Dr. Dobson said he knew the person who had led Mr. Trump to Christ, though he did not name him. \u201cI don\u2019t know when it was, but it has not been long,\u201d Dr. Dobson said. \u201cI believe he really made a commitment, but he\u2019s a baby Christian. \u201d Mr. Anthony posted the interview to his blog on Friday. Dr. Dobson could not be reached on Saturday, and Hope Hicks, the Trump campaign spokeswoman, did not respond Saturday to a request for details. Mr. Trump stumbled at times last year when speaking about faith. At one point he said that he had never asked for God\u2019s forgiveness. And after repeating on the campaign trail that the Bible was his favorite book, ahead of his own \u201cArt of the Deal,\u201d Mr. Trump declined to name a favorite verse. \u201cThe Bible means a lot to me, but I don\u2019t want to get into specifics,\u201d he told Bloomberg Television. Mr. Trump, a Presbyterian, questioned the faith of Hillary Clinton, a Methodist, at a meeting with a smaller group of evangelical leaders on Tuesday, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion. \u201d During the New York meeting, Mr. Trump made no mention of being born again. It is a possibility certain to cause chortles in some corners, but it could also open doors in others for the   presumptive Republican nominee for president. For evangelicals, \u201caccepting Christ\u201d is at the heart of becoming a genuine Christian, and refers to acknowledging sin and declaring the need for Jesus Christ as savior. \u201cThe expectation evangelicals have is of a radical change, a   turn from the life of sin to following Christ,\u201d said Kedron Bardwell, a political science professor at Simpson College in Iowa, who is the son of an evangelical pastor. With new believers, this is often done in prayer with another Christian, which may have been what Dr. Dobson was referring to when he said that he knew the person who had \u201cled him to Christ. \u201d Mr. Trump won a majority of evangelical voters in the Republican primaries, though some prominent conservative Christian leaders kept their distance. Dr. Dobson endorsed Senator Ted Cruz. Since Mr. Trump clinched the nomination in May, some of those leaders have rallied to him, including Ralph Reed. In his interview, Dr. Dobson conceded that Mr. Trump did not exactly fit the typical mold of an evangelical. \u201cHe used the word \u2018hell\u2019 four or five times,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know our language. \u201d He added that Mr. Trump \u201crefers a lot to religion and not much to faith and belief. \u201d For evangelicals, the heart of Christianity is a   dependence on God. They often contrast this with what they characterize as merely \u201creligion,\u201d which they view as more rules and  . Dr. Dobson joked that Christians should take it easy on Mr. Trump for what some might perceive as  . \u201cYou got to cut him some slack,\u201d Dr. Dobson said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t grow up like we did. \u201d Mr. Anthony referred to the   conversion of Saul, a zealous Pharisee, who later became the Apostle Paul: \u201cHe didn\u2019t know the language either. \u201d Dr. Dobson agreed. \u201cI think there\u2019s hope for him,\u201d Dr. Dobson said. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s hope for us. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562258.3732069}
