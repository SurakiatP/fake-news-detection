The show, \u201cCome From Away,\u201d is the rare Broadway musical by and about Canadians, and has been greeted enthusiastically by audiences in that country. It is now in previews on Broadway and is set to open March 12. Mr. Trudeau said he and his wife, Sophie, would attend the show on March 15, joining a group of about 600 people attending with the Consulate General of Canada in New York. \u201cCome From Away,\u201d with music, lyrics and book by a married Canadian couple, Irene Sankoff and David Hein, is about the encounter between the residents of Gander, Newfoundland, and thousands of international air travelers who were diverted there on the day of the attacks. The show was nurtured by the Canadian Music Theater Project at Sheridan College near Toronto, which is trying to cultivate more musical theater by Canadian writers. The founder of the project, Michael Rubinoff, said the show was only the fifth musical with a Canadian writing team to reach Broadway, after \u201cRockabye Hamlet\u201d in 1976, \u201cBilly Bishop Goes to War\u201d in 1980, \u201cThe Drowsy Chaperone\u201d in 2006 and \u201cThe Story of My Life\u201d in 2009. All but \u201cThe Drowsy Chaperone\u201d were considered flops. \u201cThis is extremely culturally significant, having a Canadian musical, written by Canadians about Canadians, on Broadway  \u2014   that\u2019s historic,\u201d Mr. Rubinoff said. He said the show would probably appeal to Mr. Trudeau because of his interest in the arts  \u2014   he once taught high school drama  \u2014   and because of his political agenda. \u201cThe show speaks to his values,\u201d Mr. Rubinoff said. \u201cWelcoming refugees, kindness  \u2014   these are issues he\u2019s been championing since he\u2019s been prime minister, and those themes speak to him now more than ever, given the international political climate. \u201d Mr. Trudeau\u2019s spokesman, Cameron Ahmad, said Sunday that the prime minister is coming in part to \u201csupport the success of a great Canadian cultural production. \u201d But he made clear that the show\u2019s themes are also a consideration. \u201cBoth our countries share a deep   relationship, that extends far beyond our economic ties, and is made stronger by cultural connections and shared values,\u201d Mr. Ahmad said. \u201cAnd we embrace the opportunity to highlight how we are there for each other in times of need. \u201d The show has had multiple   productions  \u2014   at the La Jolla Playhouse, Seattle Repertory Theater, Ford\u2019s Theater in Washington and the Royal Alexandra Theater in Toronto. The Toronto production was a particular success, and the show\u2019s producers have announced that they will begin a second production of the show in Toronto next February. Several Canadian politicians have already seen the show. Last fall, when the cast performed a concert version of the show in Gander, the audience included Dwight Ball, the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as Frank F. Fagan, the province\u2019s lieutenant governor. Mayor John Tory of Toronto saw the show in his city. The mayor of Calgary, Alberta, Naheed Nenshi, attended a Broadway preview, and then declared it the \u201cbest musical I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201d The show has also prompted quite a bit of interest among American government officials. Among those who saw the production in Washington were Justice Elena Kagan of the Supreme Court Laura Bush, the former first lady members of Congress and some   military officials. Several members of the Obama administration also attended a performance, including Samantha Power, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, and Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser.'"}, "time": 1742562491.9318578}
