THE UNWINDING: An Inner History of the New America, by George Packer (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) It\u2019s possible that the book that best explains the American that elected Donald J. Trump appeared more than three years ago. In \u201cThe Unwinding,\u201d George Packer took a   look at this country\u2019s institutions and mores and was appalled by what he found. The book begins like a horror novel, which to some extent it is. \u201cNo one can say when the unwinding began,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhen the coil that held Americans together in its secure and sometimes stifling grip first gave way. \u201d What follows are profiles and meditations on personalities as diverse as Sam Walton, Oprah Winfrey, Elizabeth Warren and Newt Gingrich. He describes how Mr. Gingrich\u2019s rhetoric, when he came to power in the late 1980s, changed the way elected leaders spoke to one another: \u201cHe gave them mustard gas, and they used it on every conceivable enemy, including him. \u201d His book hums with sorrow, outrage and compassion. (Dwight Garner) STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN LAND: Anger and Mourning on the American Right by Arlie Russell Hochschild (The New Press) In this finalist for the National Book Award in nonfiction, Ms. Hochschild looks closely at Tea Party supporters in Louisiana. In The New York Times Book Review, Jason DeParle wrote: \u201cA distinguished Berkeley sociologist, Hochschild is a woman of the left, but her mission is empathy, not polemics. She takes seriously the Tea Partiers\u2019 complaints that they have become the \u2018strangers\u2019 of the title  \u2014   triply marginalized by flat or falling wages, rapid demographic change, and liberal culture that mocks their faith and patriotism. Her affection for her characters is palpable. \u201cBut the resentments she finds are as toxic as the pollutants in the marsh and metastasizing throughout politics. What unites her subjects is the powerful feeling that others are \u2018cutting in line\u2019 and that the federal government is supporting people on the dole  \u2014   \u2018taking money from the workers and giving it to the idle.\u2019 Income is flowing up, but the anger points down. \u201d HILLBILLY ELEGY: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis by J. D. Vance (Harper) Mr. Vance\u2019s memoir, which has spent time at the top of the   lists, describes his experiences growing up in a   steel town in Ohio. In her review in The Times, the critic Jennifer Senior wrote: \u201cAn investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we\u2019re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube. Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he\u2019s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans. \u201d LISTEN, LIBERAL: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People? by Thomas Frank (Metropolitan   Holt  Company) In The New York Times Book Review back in April, Beverly Gage wrote: \u201cLiberals may be experiencing mixed emotions these days. The prospect of a Trump presidency has raised urgent fears: of the nation\u2019s fascist tendencies, of the potential for riots in the streets. At the same time, many liberals have expressed a grim satisfaction in watching the Republican Party tear itself apart. Whatever terrible fate might soon befall the nation, the thinking goes, it\u2019s their fault, not ours. They are the ones stirring up the base prejudices and epic resentments of America\u2019s disaffected white working class, and they must now reap the whirlwind. \u201cIn his new book, the social critic Thomas Frank poses another possibility: that liberals in general  \u2014   and the Democratic Party in particular  \u2014   should look inward to understand the sorry state of American politics. Too busy attending TED talks and vacationing in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Frank argues, the Democratic elite has abandoned the party\u2019s traditional commitments to the working class. In the process, they have helped to create the political despair and anger at the heart of today\u2019s   insurgencies. \u201d THE POPULIST EXPLOSION: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European Politics by John B. Judis (Columbia Global Reports) This \u201ccogent and exceptionally clarifying guide,\u201d Jonathan Alter wrote in The New York Times Book Review, \u201chelps to understand what \u2018populism\u2019 means, where it comes from and why it is advancing on both sides of the Atlantic. \u201d Mr. Judis distinguishes   economic populism from   cultural populism, which accuses \u201celites of coddling an   third group  \u2014   immigrants, blacks, terrorists, welfare recipients or all of the above,\u201d Mr. Alter wrote. \u201cIn the end, Judis has a surprisingly benign attitude toward even   populism. He thinks Trump and the European   populists are nasty nationalists, but not fascists, insisting that even those with authoritarian streaks believe in working within the democratic system and lack the territorial ambitions that were central to German and Italian fascism. Instead, Judis writes, Trump resembles the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the buffoonish media baron. \u201d WHITE TRASH: The   Untold History of Class in America by Nancy Isenberg (Viking) Donald J. Trump was elected by America\u2019s wealthy as well as its working class. But this eloquent book is that rare history of America that not only includes the weak, the powerless and the stigmatized, but also places them front and center. It\u2019s an analysis of the intractable caste system that lingers below the national myths of rugged individualism and cities on hills. Ms. Isenberg does not skimp on economic analysis. She notes how the central engines of our economy, from   planters up through today\u2019s bank and tax policies, have systematically harmed the working poor. \u201cWe have to wonder,\u201d she writes about her book\u2019s subjects, \u201chow such people exist amid plenty. \u201d Part of her answer is the \u201cbacklash that occurs when attempts are made to improve the conditions of the poor,\u201d from the New Deal through Obamacare. \u201cGovernment assistance is said to undermine the American dream,\u201d she writes, adding: \u201cWait. Undermine whose American dream?\u201d As if speaking of this election, she wrote: \u201cWhen you turn an election into a   circus, there\u2019s always a chance the dancing bear will win. \u201d (Dwight Garner)'"}, "time": 1742563355.5986316}
