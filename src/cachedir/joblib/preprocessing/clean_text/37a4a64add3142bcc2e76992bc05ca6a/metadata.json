Things got a little heated Thursday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day. \u201d  In a debate about health care, host Chris Cuomo insulted network contributor Mary Katharine Ham by calling her \u201ccheap. \u201d \u201c[Y]ou can be nasty about it or you can listen to me,\u201d Ham responded. \u201cI am a person, single mom of two, who has lost three or four plans since Obamacare passed,\u201d she added. \u201cI was told I would not. That was a lie. When I said that I would lose my plan, people called me a liar when this was going on. I have had a 160 percent increase in my premiums. I was told those would go down, and I\u2019ve had a 300 percent increase in my deductible. One of the ways you can fix that is by cutting some of these \u2018essential health benefits\u2019 because they are indeed not essential. \u201d (  Daily Caller) Follow Breitbart. tv on @BreitbartVideo'"}, "time": 1742563667.3517325}
