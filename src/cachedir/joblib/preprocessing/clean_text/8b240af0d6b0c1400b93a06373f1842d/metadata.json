Yes, Trump looks like he will be our next president.\\nWe have on @BrettPain and @MurderBryan from Street Fight Radio on WCRS in Columbus, Ohio to discuss what\u2019s next for those of us on the left following this absolutely crushing defeat at the hands of the extreme right-wing. It\u2019s definitely a cathartic conversation, but we don\u2019t just vent, we discuss next steps for building a powerful counterweight to right-wing demagoguery. Liberalism and sectarian leftism have failed. We can\u2019t keep blaming everyone else, this defeat requires some serious introspection from liberals and leftists alike. If you are unable to organize people to your political position, that\u2019s your fault, not the fault of those you fail to convince.\\nIt\u2019s time for those of us on the Left to get it together. No one else is going to fix this for us.\\n\\nThe post Delete Your Account \u2013 Episode 24: President Trump appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n'"}, "time": 1742562307.0573237}
