She had arrived on the arm of her publicist, who vanished as discreetly as he had arrived, leaving Ms. Huppert on her own to sit with a reporter, sip her cappuccino and ponder a question: Is she vain? Brusquely, she picked up a knife, inspecting her reflection in its blade. \u201cIs this what you mean?\u201d she asked lightly, brushing aside a stray wisp of hair. Was she being coy? Hard to say. Ambiguity, after all, is Ms. Huppert\u2019s stock in trade. It is part of the screen arsenal she has deployed in more than 100 films during the course of a   career, and it is central to her role in \u201cElle,\u201d a   psychological thriller in which she, as the victim of a vicious rape, responds with an eerie admixture of horror and calm. Her performance, which earned her a best actress award at the Golden Globes in January, drew fresh waves of attention when she was nominated this month for an Academy Award, an honor she seems to regard with a mix of anxiety and cool entitlement. Would she bring home Oscar gold on Sunday night? \u201cYeah, it\u2019s possible,\u201d she ventured, adding definitively after a pause, \u201cYes, for me it\u2019s time. \u201d That near boast, tempered by a flicker of amusement, hinted at the wickedly subversive streak that has made Ms. Huppert a muse to an international roster of directors, including Claude Chabrol, Otto Preminger, Bertrand Tavernier and Paul Verhoeven. Mr. Verhoeven, of \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d and \u201cShowgirls\u201d notoriety, directed Ms. Huppert in \u201cElle. \u201d Combined with an apparently uncontrived chic, that subversiveness has lately transformed Ms. Huppert, who is mostly known in the United States to an art house crowd, into a red carpet diva and the unlikely darling of the fashion set. Never mind that Ms. Huppert, 63, long married and the mother of three, plays a grandmother in \u201cElle. \u201d Or that in her native Paris she has long been a   fixture at Dior, Chanel and Armani. When the cameras closed in on her as she claimed her Globe, writers breathlessly anatomized every facet of her look. As the popular Who What Wear website effusively reported, \u201cHer incredibly chic   top and skirt along with an earful of edgy Repossi ear cuffs have landed the actress on a number of best dressed lists and left the internet buzzing. \u201d The Fashion Law, another widely read blog, posted, \u201cIt is difficult not to notice that Huppert is becoming a favorite not only of critics and fashion industry insiders but of those on the periphery, as well. \u201d Adding her voice to the mix, Vanessa Friedman, the New York Times fashion critic, posted on Twitter on the night of the Globes, \u201cWhoever made Isabelle Huppert\u2019s dress should take credit ASAP. \u201d Ms. Huppert had selected that dress, Armani Priv\u00e9, with care. \u201cIt\u2019s important how personal and singular you feel in what you wear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you keep your own identity. \u201d Would she turn up again in Armani on Oscar night? \u201cI might,\u201d she offered playfully. Whether she is captured on camera in a   trouser suit, as she was at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards in January in a     Chlo\u00e9 gown at the British Academy Film Awards this month or in a pale blue trouser suit, snapped alongside Nicole Kidman on the day they received their Oscar nominations, Ms. Huppert projects a singular authority. \u201cShe has what the French used to call chien,\u201d said Simon Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York. He was alluding to the blend of tough chic and barely concealed sensuality that, Mr. Doonan maintains, defines Ms. Huppert\u2019s allure. And in viewing her image on Instagram, Ryan Lobo, a designer of the New York label Tome, responded with a single word: \u201cQueen. \u201d On Instagram, Ms. Huppert is followed by no less a fashion personage than Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, the creative director of Louis Vuitton. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Jonathan Huguet, her stylist, summed up her appeal as a rare combination of masculine assurance and unexpected fragility. She is hardly indifferent to fashion, Mr. Huguet noted. \u201cShe knows her brands and designers,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is completely open to different things. \u201d He added that she was happy to try a variety of fabrics, shapes and designers, among them Haider Ackermann and Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior. Still, the style world\u2019s renewed devotion has left Ms. Huppert nonplused. \u201cAfter all,\u201d she said, a bit disingenuously, \u201cI\u2019m not a fashion person. \u201d She had dressed for breakfast at the Beverly Wilshire in a crisply tailored jacket, its deep green and coral pattern setting off her   russet hair. Who designed the jacket? Her features furrowed briefly as she removed it to check the label, exclaiming with what seemed genuine surprise: \u201cIt\u2019s J. Crew. Can you imagine?\u201d The jacket, which she wore over a pale coral Chlo\u00e9 blouse and slim trousers, was consistent with a style Ms. Huppert has refined over time, a look that is mostly defined by slim trousers, tailored jackets and coats, understated evening wear, and the occasional provocative accent (those tiny Repossi cuffs snaking up her ear). Immaculately assembled as they may be, her ensembles are \u201cworn with the effortlessness that Frenchwomen seem to naturally possess,\u201d Allyson Payer of Who What Wear posted. It is the kind of assessment that Ms. Huppert is apt to greet with one of her ironic smiles. \u201cBecause I\u2019m French, people have a certain idea of my style,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what that means. And not quite sure what it is that I\u2019m supposed to represent. \u201d When she\u2019s not acting, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as carrying a specific image. \u201d But on camera, she added: \u201cEvery change of outfit can help you. It allows you to see yourself freshly each time, and each time with fresh potential. \u201d There are times, it seems, when Ms. Huppert is all potential, her aloof, sometimes opaque, expression  \u2014   \u201cresting bitch face,\u201d as the fashion tribes would have it  \u2014   acting as a potent draw. \u201cIt\u2019s intrinsic to her, that certain enigmatic je ne sais quoi,\u201d Mr. Doonan said. If her mystery tends to mesmerize devout fashionistas, it\u2019s not for the first time. Ms. Huppert herself is well aware that she has long fascinated fashion photographers, among them Richard Avedon, Guy Bourdin, Helmut Newton, Hedi Slimane and their illustrious like. \u201cHer face is like a window, it\u2019s so transparent,\u201d said Peter Lindbergh, who has shot her many times. \u201cWhen you photograph people, often that window is closed. Some people let you in, but there is a limit. But Isabelle, she is like glass. \u201d She also has a chameleonlike quality that was captured in 2005 in a show of her portraits at MoMA PS1, subsequently gathered in book form, that volume, like the show, aptly titled, \u201cIsabelle Huppert: Woman of Many Faces. \u201d Perhaps most famously, she posed,   for Newton wearing a white bathrobe that opened to expose a sliver of nipple, her expression in that instant a disconcerting blend of innocence and insolence. Her face, she knows, can be a difficult read. \u201cMost of the time it is more like a white canvas on which you can project many things,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s inexpressive, but it is undefined enough that it can be shaped and defined by whoever looks at you. \u201d She laughed. \u201cIn the end something that could be seen as a fault turns out to be an advantage,\u201d she said. However malleable her features, however vulnerable she may seem onscreen, Ms. Huppert wants you to know that ultimately she is the one in charge. \u201cI play a role, but I don\u2019t transform myself entirely,\u201d she said. \u201cThe irony you see, the humor, the way of being cool, it\u2019s me more than anyone else, I have to say. \u201d Some take it for perversity, a trait that has marked her since she appeared onscreen in the early 2000s as the   sadomasochistic antiheroine of the erotic thriller \u201cThe Piano Teacher. \u201d \u201cWhat people call perverse and outside the margins, it has nothing to do with perversity,\u201d Ms. Huppert said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about doing one thing and maybe thinking another. That\u2019s what we all do, and that\u2019s what you see in me on film. \u201d Nor does she, in her acting, make an effort to seduce. \u201cI\u2019m not really interested in pleasing,\u201d she said in her teasing contralto. \u201cI think the best way to please is not to please. \u201d That refusal is one source of a sexual charisma that can defy analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t use the usual seductive tools,\u201d Ms. Huppert said. \u201cMy sexuality is almost cerebral. It\u2019s never, \u2018Look at me, see how sexy I am. \u2019\u201d On the screen she is permitted an erotic latitude not generally available to her contemporaries, in particular Meryl Streep, with whom she is often, if misguidedly, compared. As Mich\u00e8le in \u201cElle,\u201d Ms. Huppert pursues her own sexual agenda, whatever the cost. In a recent fashion feature in The Reporter, she comes off as a steamy,   vixen, aptly costumed in   black leather. She is also permitted a display of   that doesn\u2019t quite square with the sexual hunger she is sometimes asked to portray on film. Some call it coldness  \u2014   a Brechtian detachment, as Mr. Verhoeven remarked  \u2014   or a chilly reflection of  . Does that translate to vanity? Ms. Huppert wondered, returning to a topic that she clearly finds absorbing. \u201cIf it does, I don\u2019t care. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564043.4853966}
