[The arrests  \u2014   including captains, soldiers, and associates  \u2014   were part of a multiagency effort conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Waterfront Commission of the New York Harbor.  Angel M. Melendez, special agent in charge of HSI New York, noted the impact that the Luchese Family had on the New York City area. \u201cThe Luchese Family and its associates are alleged to be linked to guns, drugs, racketeering, and murder. They are also alleged to have used their criminal enterprise to launder money, tamper with witnesses and extortion,\u201d said Melendez. \u201cIt is clear that this \u2018family\u2019 business is of no benefit to its community or to this great city. HSI will continue to strengthen its partnership with the FBI and NYPD to ensure that alleged criminals like the Luchese Family face the consequences of their actions. \u201d Authorities arrested 15 of the 19 defendants on Wednesday the other four defendants were already in custody. Seventeen of the defendants, if convicted, are facing life sentences. Those charged in the superseding indictment are (potential sentence): The members of the Luchese Family worth noting are Matthew Madonna, the alleged street boss Steven Crea Sr. the alleged underboss Steven Crea Jr. an alleged captain and Joseph Dinapoli, the alleged consigliere of the Luchese Family. La Cosa Nostra is considered by authorities to be alive and well in the U. S.: La Cosa Nostra operates through entities known as \u201cFamilies. \u201d In the New York City area, those families include the Genovese, Gambino, Luchese, Bonanno, Colombo, and Decavalcante Families. Each Family operates through groups of individuals known as \u201ccrews\u201d and \u201cregimes. \u201d Each \u201ccrew\u201d has as its leader a person known as a \u201cCaporegime,\u201d \u201cCapo,\u201d \u201cCaptain,\u201d or \u201cSkipper,\u201d who is responsible for supervising the criminal activities of his crew and providing \u201cSoldiers\u201d and associates with support and protection. In return, the Capo typically receives a share of the illegal earnings of each of his crew\u2019s Soldiers and associates, which is sometimes referred to as \u201cAttribute\u201d. Each crew consists of \u201cmade\u201d members, sometimes known as \u201cSoldiers,\u201d \u201cwiseguys,\u201d \u201cfriends of ours,\u201d and \u201cgood fellows. \u201d Soldiers are aided in their criminal endeavors by other trusted individuals, known as \u201cassociates,\u201d who sometimes are referred to as \u201cconnected\u201d or identified as \u201cwith\u201d a Soldier or other member of the Family. Associates participate in the various activities of the crew and its members. In order for an associate to become a made member of the Family, the associate must first be of Italian descent and typically needs to demonstrate the ability to generate income for the Family and the willingness to commit acts of violence. In August 2016, Breitbart reported the FBI arrested 46 alleged members of the Italian mafia along the east coast of the U. S. accused of \u201cengaging in extortion, arson, fraud, illegal gambling, firearms trafficking and assault. \u201d Ryan Saavedra is a contributor for Breitbart Texas and can be found on Twitter at @RealSaavedra.'"}, "time": 1742563487.9973605}
