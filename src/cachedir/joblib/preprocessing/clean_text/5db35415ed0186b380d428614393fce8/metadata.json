He stands in the wings of the Dolby Theater here in a tuxedo and pulls sealed envelopes out of a briefcase, giving the correct one to presenters as they walk onto the stage. This is the one night a year when the   PwC really gets to shine. The firm\u2019s chief executive sits with stars in the audience. Mr. Cullinan walks the red carpet, where reporters often say he resembles Matt Damon. He told one TV crew that he had no nerves. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this a few times,\u201d he said before Sunday night\u2019s show, \u201cand we prepare a lot. \u201d He was so at ease, he even found time to tweet from backstage about Emma Stone as the show neared its climax. Whoops. In an epic bungle before 33 million viewers  \u2014   one that could get his company fired as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 accountant after 83 years and which robbed \u201cMoonlight,\u201d an     film, of its proper moment of celebration  \u2014   Mr. Cullinan caused the   musical \u201cLa La Land\u201d to be mistakenly named best picture at the 89th Academy Awards. PwC\u2019s chief executive watched the scene from the third row. At the climactic moment backstage, a crew member shouted \u201cOh my God\u201d as the jubilant producers of \u201cLa La Land\u201d thanked their families. \u201cHe got the wrong envelope!\u201d \u201cHe\u201d was Warren Beatty, who, along with Faye Dunaway, presented the final award of the night. Mr. Beatty opened the envelope and, after some hesitation, handed it to Ms. Dunaway. She said that \u201cLa La Land,\u201d about young California dreamers, was the winner. The crowd erupted in applause, and the \u201cLa La Land\u201d team rushed the stage. Why did it take minutes to fix the error? \u201cPwC sounded the alarm, but not right away,\u201d Gary Natoli, the telecast\u2019s stage manager, said in a text message. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until just before I jumped onstage that it was confirmed by both Brian and Martha as the winner being incorrect. \u201d Martha L. Ruiz, a PwC colleague of Mr. Cullinan\u2019s who stood on the opposite side of the stage, and Mr. Cullinan apparently needed to find each other backstage to confer before speaking up. It was one of the most surprising reversals in Oscar history, as human error combined with live television to powerful,   effect. It also warped and dampened the euphoria of film executives and artists who had spent years working on the two movies. And for the academy, which had been criticized last year for failing to nominate any minority actors for the second consecutive year, there was a missed moment: Instead of a proper celebration of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d there was a televised scene of confusion, disbelief and astonishment. Backstage, Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, the telecast\u2019s producers, were sitting at their monitors, Diet Cokes in hand. They were under the impression that the show was a wrap. But the scene quickly became chaotic, as it emerged that the winner was, in fact, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a tender drama about a young, black man coming to terms with his homosexuality. \u201cI\u2019m holding the envelope and the award, and I had just given my speech, and there are people on the stage with headsets and I thought, \u2018That doesn\u2019t seem right,\u2019\u201d Jordan Horowitz, a \u201cLa La Land\u201d producer, recalled. Exactly what happened in the moments leading up to the mistaken announcement was still being sorted out on Monday, but pieces of the story began falling into place. Mr. Cullinan  \u2014   perhaps distracted by his Twitter feed  \u2014   handed Mr. Beatty an envelope containing the name of the best actress winner, an award that had already been given to Ms. Stone of \u201cLa La Land. \u201d The next seven humiliating minutes would find Ms. Dunaway blurting out the wrong best picture winner, the   audience gasping and   and a dance onstage as \u201cLa La Land\u201d producers gracefully made way for the \u201cMoonlight\u201d team. \u201cI haven\u2019t received any formal explanation,\u201d Marc Platt, another member of the \u201cLa La Land\u201d producing team, said on Monday afternoon. \u201cThere may have been disappointment in the moment, tremendous disappointment, but the good news is that I feel a unity in our community today. \u2018Moonlight\u2019 won best picture. But many voices in many kinds of films were honored. \u201d This account of the awards show\u2019s frantic final moments was based on interviews with producers of both \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d academy officials crew members for the telecast and PwC executives. Some provided information on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. An academy spokeswoman directed queries to PwC. Another academy official said the organization had initiated a review of the backstage process and of the group\u2019s association going forward with the accounting firm, which extends beyond balloting for the Oscars. \u201cI read the card that was in the envelope,\u201d Mr. Beatty told reporters on his way to the Governors Ball, a   party. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is very strange because it says best actress on the card.\u2019 And I felt that maybe there was some sort of misprint. \u201d Pressed further, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say on the subject. \u201d Ms. Dunaway declined to comment. For its part, PwC expressed remorse. \u201cWe are owning this mistake,\u201d said Tim Ryan, the United States chairman of PwC. \u201cI\u2019ve reached out to the academy. I\u2019ve shared my personal apology, the firm\u2019s apology, and I\u2019ve begun to talk to them about things we can do to make it right. \u201d The firm declined to make Mr. Cullinan available for an interview, but it later said that once he mistakenly handed out the wrong envelope, \u201cprotocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr. Cullinan or his partner. \u201d In keeping with past practice, PwC prepared two identical sets of sealed envelopes before the Oscars show. Ms. Ruiz kept a complete set on one side of the stage, while Mr. Cullinan had another set on the other. It was Ms. Ruiz who handed the best actress envelope to Leonardo DiCaprio, who presented the award to Ms. Stone. (As they walked off the stage, Mr. DiCaprio handed her the envelope and said, \u201cMake sure you keep this. \u201d) Next up: Mr. Beatty and Ms. Dunaway, reuniting to mark the 50th anniversary of \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d and announce the best picture winner. It was then that Mr. Cullinan handed Mr. Beatty the spare   envelope instead of the   envelope. What led to the mistake by Mr. Cullinan was not known, but it could have to do with the envelope\u2019s design. The academy used a new envelope this year, featuring red paper with gold outside lettering that specifies the award inside. That may have made the outside of the envelopes more difficult to read than last year\u2019s, which featured gold paper and red lettering. Mr. Natoli, the stage manager, was the one who approached Mr. Horowitz, the \u201cLa La Land\u201d producer, to see that the envelope he was holding was the spare announcing Ms. Stone\u2019s acting win. \u201cThe guys in headsets were going around with urgency looking for the other envelope,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. \u201cOne of the guys opens it, and it says \u2018Moonlight,\u2019 and I took it onstage and went to the microphone and said what I said. \u201d Mr. Horowitz reacted quickly. \u201cYou guys, I\u2019m sorry, no,\u201d he said from the stage. \u201cThere\u2019s a mistake. \u2018Moonlight,\u2019 you guys won best picture. \u201d For the filmmakers and actors in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d those final minutes were no less stunning. \u201cWe all looked at each other and were like, \u2018Is this a joke? \u2019\u201d the actor Andre Holland said later. \u201cWe waited and kept watching. We didn\u2019t want to celebrate until we knew if it was a joke and whether this was really happening. \u201d As soon as the show ended, Dawn Hudson, the academy\u2019s chief executive, jumped from her seat in the theater and marched backstage. Ms. Hudson and Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the academy\u2019s president, gathered Ms. Dunaway, Mr. Beatty, the PwC accountants and other crew members into the theater\u2019s green room. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Dawn look that mad,\u201d a crew member said.'"}, "time": 1742562090.7071671}
