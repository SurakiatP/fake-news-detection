[Dr Salem Abdel Galil, a theologian at Cairo\u2019s prestigious Al Azhar academy and a former   of the Ministry of Religions, said on his television program that \u201cAllah, hallowed be his name, chose Mary of all the women, alongside Asiya, Pharaoh\u2019s wife, Aisha and Khadijea, Prophet Muhammed\u2019s wives, and Fatima, the Prophet\u2019s daughter. There are verses in the Quran that suggest that in heaven Muhammed will marry the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus peace be upon him, as well as Asiya, Pharaoh\u2019s wife and Kultum, the sister of Moses peace be upon him. \u201d  \u201cThe Quran said: \u2018Allah will give [the Prophet] women preferable to his wives, Muslim, pious, pure women. \u2019\u201d One, he said, referred to Asiya and the other to Mary. Egypt\u2019s Christian community was enraged by Galil\u2019s remarks. The community\u2019s youth movement issued a statement demanding an apology. The movement\u2019s chairman, Nader Soubhi, said: \u201cWe Christians don\u2019t recognize any aspect of the Virgin Mary except her sanctity, her purity and her virginity. The Virgin Mary will never lose any of these. \u201d In 2010, an Al Azhar cleric caused controversy with a similar ruling, which also raised the church\u2019s ire. Then too, church representatives said they rejected the ruling \u201cwhich contradicts our religion and holy book. It\u2019s offensive to the Virgin Mary. \u201d Reverend Abdel Masih Basit said that \u201cthe Virgin became pregnant while a virgin, and will forever remain so. And according to Jesus, in heaven you don\u2019t marry but become angels. \u201d \u201cThe Christian faith relies on the belief that a man\u2019s soul turns into a spirit after his death and his body turns into light, and therefore there\u2019s no need for partnership or sexual intercourse,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563481.2981796}
