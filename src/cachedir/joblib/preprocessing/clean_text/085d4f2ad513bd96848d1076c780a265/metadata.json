Far from being a marketplace for consensual exchanges, Backpage, the authorities said, often used teasers like \u201cAmber Alert\u201d and \u201cLolita\u201d to signal that children were for sale. In the midst of a Senate investigation, a federal grand jury inquiry in Arizona, two federal lawsuits and criminal charges in California accusing Backpage\u2019s operators of pimping children, the website abruptly bowed to pressure in January and replaced its sex ads with the word \u201cCensored\u201d in red. Even so, Tiffany  \u2014   a street name  \u2014   did not stop using the site, she said. Instead, her ads moved to Backpage\u2019s dating section. \u201cNew in town,\u201d read a recent one, using words that have become code for selling sex. \u201cLooking for someone to hang out with. \u201d Other recent dating ads listed one female as \u201c100% young\u201d and suggested that \u201coh daddy can i be your candy. \u201d In the fight against child sex trafficking, shutting down an epicenter like Backpage was a major victory, but one against a relentless foe that quickly unfurled new tentacles. The demise of Backpage\u2019s adult ads undermined the trade, but it also illustrated how difficult it is to stamp out the practice of selling children for sex. The crime is rarely punished with the full force of the law  \u2014   charges like rape or statutory rape  \u2014   officials say in many places it leads to just a citation, instead of an arrest. For Tiffany, 18, the demise of Backpage\u2019s adult listings has made things far more unpredictable  \u2014   and dangerous, she said. The old ads allowed her to try to vet customers by contacting them before meetings, via phone or text message. With far fewer inquiries from the dating ads, she said, her first encounters with men now take place more often on the street as she gets into cars in red light districts around the Bay Area. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to catch a date now,\u201d she said. \u201cNow everybody\u2019s daddy puts them on the street. \u201d Eric Quan, a sergeant in the   unit with the San Jose Police Department, said there had been a conspicuous rise in street prostitution in San Jose, where Tiffany is often forced to work. \u201cWhen Backpage was running adult ads, we used to get tips, but that has dropped off,\u201d Sergeant Quan said. \u201cIt makes it a lot more complicated for us to figure out what\u2019s going on. \u201d \u201cI do see more girls on the street, but we\u2019re not sure why,\u201d he said, referring to all females, not specifically minors. \u201cThere\u2019s more guys out there, too, because there\u2019s more girls to choose from. \u201d Advocates said that while the elimination of the listings was a step forward, by itself it was more an inconvenience than a crippling blow. \u201cIt was such a huge marketplace that any way to eliminate the widespread distribution of ads is progress,\u201d said Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, a   organization focused on   violence. \u201cBut until we see a more comprehensive solution, it is going to pop up elsewhere. \u201d The fight against the sex trafficking of children is an old and often doomed one, in part because the crime is typically tied to poverty and dysfunctional families. Many of the girls and boys are runaways or foster children whose disappearances rarely set off a real Amber Alert. Nationally, about 35 percent of minors charged with prostitution are, like Tiffany,   according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In Alameda County, Calif. where pimps have sold Tiffany most often, more than 60 percent of children who are trafficked or at risk of being trafficked are   according to the Alameda County district attorney. The county\u2019s   population is about 12 percent. Few jurisdictions keep data on the men arrested in such cases. But one area that keeps track, King County in Washington, found that 79 percent of the men charged with seeking to pay for sex with a minor from 2013 to 2015 were white, while 44 percent of those they were accused of propositioning were  . The county\u2019s population is 7 percent  . \u201cWe educate our judges that although there is no single buyer profile, buyers are predominantly white, educated, married men,\u201d said Victoria Sweet, a lawyer for the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. It is unclear how many minors are forced into prostitution each year, but the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said reports of online child sex trafficking had increased by more than 800 percent from 2010 to 2015. The organization said this was \u201cdirectly correlated to the increased use of the internet to sell children for sex. \u201d Backpage, where revenue increased to $135 million in 2014 from $5. 3 million in 2008, derived more than 90 percent of its earnings from its adult ads, according to the California Department of Justice. Backpage representatives declined to comment, but in a statement released in January the company said it had notified law enforcement whenever it became aware of illegal activity. It also said it was protected by a federal statute that shields   internet content providers from liability. \u201cThe shutdown of Backpage\u2019s adult classified advertising is an assault on the First Amendment,\u201d the company\u2019s statement read in part. In Oakland, International Boulevard is among the busiest strips in the nation for the trafficking of minors, part of a network whose spokes extend to similar strips in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Seattle and Reno, Nev. In warm weather, Tiffany said, she can often be found there, dressed in little more than a halter top and panties. The Oakland police, enmeshed in their own   scandal, said they had not seen a recent increase in prostitution along International Boulevard. Other departments around the nation acknowledged that they were not the best source for such information because officers infrequently made arrests and did not track activity. In January, a law barring children from being arrested for prostitution went into effect in California. Tiffany said she had been sent as far away as Pennsylvania and Florida, usually via Backpage ads. Once she was given a   bus ticket while her pimp took a plane, she said. Tiffany, who spoke on the condition that her real name not be used, said she was trying to quit the business. But without a high school diploma, her job prospects are slim. During an interview, she spoke    about the last four years, recounting the threat of violence from both pimps and the men who buy her. But she also said she had been in love with some of her pimps, most of them men, one a woman. Within the span of a few seconds, she burst into tears while talking about the betrayal she felt when one pimp punished her by having his brother touch her, then had a fit of laughter while reading complimentary text messages from men who had purchased her for sex. With her long fingernails, hair extensions and a preoccupation with the fashionable, she could easily be mistaken for an unremarkable teenager. She said she would be \u201ctoo bored\u201d to work a regular job. Tiffany\u2019s mother, who she said might have worked as a prostitute, gave her to her grandmother the day she was born. Her father, she said, is a pimp. At 14, she was lured by two Facebook acquaintances to a party that became a gang rape, she said. Since then, she said, she had been conditioned  \u2014   through beatings, gang rapes and other violence  \u2014   to please her pimps, many of whom found her by perusing Backpage. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m good at,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce you bust a first date, you\u2019re likely to bust another. You have power, and you know you\u2019ll never be broke again. \u201d (As it happened, though, pimps generally kept all her money.) For years, Tiffany said, she habitually took Ecstasy, which she said made her \u201chappy and numb\u201d  \u2014   a state that she said enabled her to work long hours and forget the fact that she was being sold for sex. At 16, she was placed in the custody of Awaken, a Christian nonprofit organization that works to end sexual exploitation, but she repeatedly ran away to return to pimps. Awaken put Tiffany in touch with a reporter in the hope that her sharing her experience would help others in similar situations. In recent weeks, Tiffany said, she has become scared of being on the street after a man who had bought her showed her a loaded gun. \u201cI feel like something\u2019s going to happen to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe average life is seven years, and I started at age 14. When I started, the other girls called me \u2018Baby. \u2019\u201d She paused. \u201cNow, I\u2019m one of the older ones. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562906.615065}
