Clinton is in serious trouble,\u201d the Megaupload founder tweeted last night.\\nKim Dotcom\u2019s promise is worthy of attention given his long standing relationship with Wikileaks and Julian Assange. During an interview with Bloomberg in May 2015, Dotcom (real name Kim Schmitz) acknowledged, \u201cI love to talk to them\u201d.\\nHe also predicted that Julian Assange would be Hillary\u2019s worst nightmare in 2016 \u201cbecause he has access to information,\u201d a forecast that very much came true.\\n\\nThere's unpublished material, yet to come out. Clinton is in serious trouble.\\n\u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) November 1, 2016 \\n\\nThis is not the first time that the entrepreneur\u2019s tweets have prompted speculation to swirl. Schmitz has hinted on a number of occasions that Wikileaks is in possession of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33,000 missing emails.\\nLast week, Schmitz tweeted at Wikileaks with a video of himself reacting to \u201cyou\u2019ve got mail\u201d audio. Hours before, he also sent out another tweet which stated, \u201cBleachbit(ch) can\u2019t bleach it,\u201d a reference to the software tool used by Hillary to hide traces of her deleted emails.\\n\u201cI know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally,\u201d Schmitz tweeted on October 27, adding that they \u201care all stored in the NSA spy cloud in Utah.\u201d\\nI know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump . 100% true.

It\u2019s Podesta emailing everybody, the DNC, everybody in the Hillary campaign, but there are no Hillary Clinton emails in this Podesta dump,\u201d said Limbaugh.\\n\u201cAlong comes Kim Dotcom who\u2019s got an axe to grind with the U.S. government, the Obama administration. He knows Assange. So the people \u2014 nobody knows \u2014 this is all speculation. What\u2019s going on here is that Kim Dotcom has worked with Assange and is really the hacker.
