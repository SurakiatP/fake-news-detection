We\u2019d be incinerated in the blast or poisoned by radiation or left to starve in a nuclear winter. \\nBut at least I always assumed that this horrific possibility would only come into play over something truly worthy, assuming that anything would justify the mass extinction of life on the planet. Peter Sellers playing Dr. Strangelove as he struggles to control his right arm from making a Nazi salute. \\nNow, however, Official Washington\u2019s neocons and liberal interventionists are telling me and others that we should risk nuclear annihilation over which set of thieves gets to rule Ukraine and over helping Al Qaeda terrorists (and their \u201cmoderate\u201d allies) keep control of east Aleppo in Syria. \\nIn support of the Ukraine goal, there is endless tough talk at the think tanks, on the op-ed pages and in the halls of power about the need to arm the Ukrainian military so it can crush ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine who dared object to the U.S.-backed coup in 2014 that ousted their elected President Viktor Yanukovych. \\nAnd after \u201cliberating\u201d eastern Ukraine, the U.S.-backed Ukrainian army would wheel around and \u201cliberate\u201d Crimea from Russia, even though 96 percent of Crimean voters voted to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia \u2013 and there is no sign they want to go back . \\nSo, the world would be risking World War III over the principle of the West\u2019s right to sponsor the overthrow of elected leaders who don\u2019t do what they\u2019re told and then to slaughter people who object to this violation of democratic order. \\nThis risk of nuclear Armageddon would then be compounded to defend the principle that the people of Crimea don\u2019t have the right of self-determination but must submit to a corrupt post-coup regime in Kiev regardless of Crimea\u2019s democratic judgment. \\nAnd, to further maintain our resolve in this gamble over nuclear war in defense of Ukraine, we must ignore the spectacle of the U.S.-backed regime in Kiev wallowing in graft and corruption . \\nWhile the Ukrainian people earn on average $214 a month and face neoliberal \u201creforms,\u201d such as reduced pensions, extended years of work for the elderly and slashed heating subsidies, their new leaders in the parliament report wealth averaging more than $1 million in \u201cmonetary assets\u201d each, much of it in cash. \\nA Troubling Departure \\nThe obvious implication of widespread corruption was underscored on Monday with the abrupt resignation of former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili who was the appointed governor of Ukraine\u2019s Odessa region. A scene from \u201cDr. Strangelove,\u201d in which the bomber pilot (played by actor Slim Pickens) rides a nuclear bomb to its target in the Soviet Union. \\nThough Saakashvili faces charges of abusing power back in Georgia, he was nevertheless put in charge of Odessa by current President Petro Poroshenko, but has now quit (or was ousted) amid charges and counter-charges about corruption. \\nNoting the mysterious wealth of Ukraine\u2019s officials, Saakashvili denounced the country\u2019s rulers as \u201ccorrupt filth\u201d and accused Poroshenko and his administration of sabotaging real reform. \\n\u201cOdessa can only develop once Kiev will be freed from these bribe takers, who directly patronize organized crime and lawlessness,\u201d Saakashvili said . Yes, that would be a good slogan to scribble on the side of a nuclear bomb heading for Moscow: \u201cDefending the corrupt filth and bribe takers who patronize organized crime.\u201d \\nBut the recent finger-pointing about corruption is also ironic because the West cited the alleged corruption of the Yanukovych government to justify the violent putsch in February 2014 that drove him from office and sparked Ukraine\u2019s current civil war. \\nYet, the problems don\u2019t stop with Kiev\u2019s corruption. There is the troubling presence of neo-Nazis , ultranationalists and even Islamic jihadists assigned to the Azov battalion and other military units sent east to the front lines to kill ethnic Russians. \\nOn top of that, United Nations human rights investigators have accused Ukraine\u2019s SBU intelligence service of hiding torture chambers . \\nBut we consumers of the mainstream U.S. media\u2019s narrative are supposed to see the putschists as the white hats and Yanukovych (who was excoriated for having a sauna in his official residence) and Russian President Vladimir Putin as the black hats. \\nThough U.S. officials, such as Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, helped organize or \u201cmidwife\u201d the coup ousting Yanukovych, we are told that the Ukraine crisis was a clear-cut case of \u201cRussian aggression\u201d and Crimea\u2019s decision to secede (and rejoin Russia) was a \u201cRussian invasion\u201d and an \u201cannexation.\u201d \\nSo, all stirred up with righteous indignation, we absorbed the explanation that economic sanctions were needed to punish Putin and to destabilize Russian society, with the hoped-for goal of another \u201cregime change,\u201d this time in Moscow. \\nWe weren\u2019t supposed to ask if anyone had actually thought through the idea of destabilizing a nuclear-armed power and the prospect that Putin\u2019s overthrow, even if possible, might lead to a highly unstable fight for control of the nuclear codes. \\nSilencing Dissent \\nBrushing aside such worries, the neocons/liberal-hawks are confident that the answer is to move NATO forces up to Russia\u2019s borders and to provide military training to Ukraine\u2019s army, even to its neo-Nazi \u201cshock troops.\u201d Nazi symbols on helmets worn by members of Ukraine\u2019s Azov battalion. (As filmed by a Norwegian film crew and shown on German TV) \\nAfter all, when have the neocons and their liberal interventionist sidekicks ever miscalculated about anything. No fair mentioning Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya or other lucky countries that have been on the receiving end of a benighted \u201cregime change.\u201d \\nAn American who protests or even mentions the risk of nuclear war is dismissed as a \u201cKremlin stooge\u201d or a \u201cPutin puppet\u201d or a \u201cuseful fool\u201d repeating \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d and assisting Moscow\u2019s \u201cinformation war\u201d against the U.S. government. \\nBut if you\u2019re still a bit queasy about risking nuclear annihilation to keep some Ukrainian kleptocrats in power, there is the other cause worth having the human race die over: protecting Al Qaeda terrorists and their \u201cmoderate\u201d rebel comrades holed up in east Aleppo. \\nSince these modern terrorists turn out to be highly skilled with video cameras and the dissemination of propaganda, they have created the image for Westerners that the Syrian military and its Russian allies simply want to kill as many children as possible. \\nIndeed, most Western coverage of the battle for Aleppo whites out the role of Al Qaeda almost completely although occasionally the reality slips through in on-the-ground reporting , along with the admission that Al Qaeda and its fellow fighters are keeping as many civilians in east Aleppo as possible, all the better to put up heartrending videos and photos on social media. \\nOf course, when a similar situation exists in Islamic State-held Mosul, Iraq, the mainstream Western media dutifully denounces the tactic of keeping children in a war zone as the cynical use of \u201chuman shields,\u201d thus justifying Iraqi and U.S. forces killing lots of civilians during their \u201cliberation.\u201d The deaths are all the enemy\u2019s fault. \\nHowever, when the shoe is on the Syrian/Russian foot, we\u2019re talking about \u201cwar crimes\u201d and the need to invade Syria to establish \u201csafe zones\u201d and \u201cno-fly zones\u201d even if that means killing large numbers of additional Syrians and shooting down Russian warplanes. \\nAfter all, isn\u2019t the protection of Al Qaeda terrorists worth the risk of starting World War III with nuclear-armed Russia? And if Al Qaeda isn\u2019t worth fighting a nuclear war to defend, what about the thieves in Ukraine and their neo-Nazi shock troops?
