Why would HBO lower the curtain on Season 5 of \u201cGirls\u201d with two episodes on Sunday rather than the usual one at a time? Why not give the show\u2019s 10 episodes a full 10 weeks? But there are the mysteries. Then there are the realities. And the presumable reality is that decks needed clearing and hatches needed battening for next weekend\u2019s simultaneous resumption of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d  \u2014   and the Saturday unveiling of whatever this    Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cLemonade\u201d thing is supposed to be. So Sunday\u2019s   \u201cGirls\u201d finale points to the national indifference that\u2019s accrued around a show whose fealty to discomfort, poor choices and social cannibalism, which felt new in 2012, are now just part of television\u2019s oxygen. In the last two seasons, the show\u2019s senses of satire and pathos are stronger and more pungent than everBut it\u2019s true: Funny narcissists are indeed easy to come by (even on HBO). Perhaps instead you\u2019re watching \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d \u201cVeep\u201d \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cTogetherness\u201d \u201cCrazy  \u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst. \u201d And \u201cGirls\u201d didn\u2019t invent them. There they were, for instance, on \u201cThe Golden Girls,\u201d \u201cWill  Grace,\u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201c30 Rock. \u201d But \u201cGirls\u201d keeps finding ways of dramatizing its satire so that it doesn\u2019t always seem satirical. Few shows better explore the complications of personality and behavior. Even if it doesn\u2019t appear as robust, refined and specific an achievement as, say, \u201cTransparent,\u201d the show still has the confidence to jump along a tightrope of displeasure. [ Has \u201cGirls\u201d gotten better? Read our discussion. ] The show\u2019s   ringmastered by its chief protagonist, Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham) pinball off one another, going from friends to lovers to frenemies. What set the show apart this year  \u2014   from both its previous seasons and most of its peers  \u2014   is the use of the space, place, framing, allusion and mood to house that narcissism. Bad manners are met with mannerism. Shoshanna\u2019s first adult job landed her in Tokyo and, for a few episodes, the show went with her. Her intoxication with the culture  \u2014   without her Japanese pals losing sight of her foreignness  \u2014   felt like a gentle rebuke of the incurious insularity of a movie like \u201cLost in Translation. \u201d She wasn\u2019t a citizen. Nor was she a tourist. This season\u2019s seventh episode was particularly handsome. Written by Sarah Heyward and directed by Richard Shepard, it turned the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese into a piece of immersive theater staged inside and around a stately apartment complex, which was meant to evoke the building near where Genovese was killed, while her neighbors went about their business. The killing inspired decades of   research the show used the case as an ideal test for the characters\u2019 own emotional nearsightedness. (\u201cHello Kitty\u201d is the episode\u2019s title.) Hannah enters the building lobby   with her current boyfriend, Fran (Jake Lacy) and leaves devastated that her ex, Adam (Adam Driver) might be sleeping with one of her best friends, Jessa (Jemima Kirke). As usual, the comedy comes, in part, from Hannah\u2019s obnoxious rebellion against propriety, which tends to be represented by poor Ray (Alex Karpovsky). His morality, civic engagement, loyalty and earnestness (culturally, he\u2019s a generation older) are constantly disrupted, compromised and exploited by everyone else. This time he just wants to lose himself in some theater and no one will let him. The small silences in this episode are rich and absorptive. They\u2019re too much, though, for Hannah, who keeps breaking them to muse about the artifice of it all. When her friend Marnie (Allison Williams) enters one apartment, newly single and almost radioactively aglow, she doubles the obliviousness. It\u2019s unclear she even knows she\u2019s at a play. They\u2019re there to see Adam perform as half of a squabbling married couple, but by the time the play reaches its grisly climax, none of these people are really paying attention. Adam looked across the courtyard at Jessa, who\u2019s vamping at him on a fire escape, while Hannah watches them both in disbelief. They ignore the screams and barely notice the amateurish plaster statues that stand in for the victim and her killer. There\u2019s just Brenda Lee misting up the soundtrack. Basically, a   crime loses out to a figurative one. It\u2019s one of the show\u2019s most sophisticated and most intricately filmed gags about selfishness. The camera glides toward windows. It cranes downs at the plaster  . It oscillates from Jessa to Adam to Hannah. Perhaps you think about \u201cRear Window,\u201d \u201cMonsieur Hire,\u201d \u201cStakeout\u201d or any other movie involving voyeurism, danger and a little melodrama. And the atmosphere is so rich you can practically feel the balm of warm spring air. But Hannah and Marnie peel off to commiserate. And by the time you see these two spread out on somebody\u2019s bed, they\u2019ve cast themselves in their own sitcom: \u201cThe Sorrow and the  . \u201d But the show manages to maintain the gravity of both transgressions: an ambitious if seemingly dumb take on real tragedy and the tragedy that Hannah thinks is her life. It\u2019s a kicky, poignant   of television  \u2014   half of which is spent elsewhere at a Manhattan party, featuring Hannah\u2019s roommate, Elijah (Andrew Rannells) who is trying to hold his own among greasy gay celebrities. Each plot warranted its own episode, but that was \u201cGirls\u201d this year: so many good ideas, so little space to unfurl them. There were moments during the series\u2019 underrated fourth season when, between Hannah\u2019s damningly indulgent stint at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop and the invention of a carnivorous   named   (Gillian Jacobs) the show looked as if it had found its groove as a   farce. This fifth season ended on a   note, after Hannah runs into Tally (Jenny Slate) a college classmate, with a dark cloud of hair, who has become a literary star. She\u2019s like Bizzaro Hannah: Her narcissism doesn\u2019t repel success it vacuums it up. Tally encourages Hannah to steal a guy\u2019s unlocked bike (it\u2019s a sign, Tally says) and through two montages  \u2014   set first to Vanity Fare then to Nicki Minaj and Beyonc\u00e9  \u2014   they take a ride, smoke a joint on Hannah\u2019s bed, and dance in her apartment. And for half an episode, as Tally and Hannah pedal and puff, \u201cGirls\u201d is no longer \u201cGirls. \u201d It\u2019s \u201cBroad City. \u201d On that show, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson mount a perfectly calibrated celebration of millennial obnoxiousness, while also nailing the ridiculousness of   consumer culture. The two shows have unruly young women and Brooklyn in common. That\u2019s about it. But the way Ms. Slate is made to look resembles  \u2014   passingly, cartoonishly  \u2014   Ms. Glazer. These scenes between Ms. Slate and Ms. Dunham suggest a lunatic road not taken. \u201cGirls\u201d has some great slapstick. But it\u2019s bending toward maturity that \u201cBroad City\u201d doesn\u2019t care about. When it started, \u201cGirls\u201d was received as an anthem for entitled white women. Detractors had a field day with Ms. Dunham, who created this show and has written and directed much of it, for privileging privilege, as if she couldn\u2019t be aspiring to the withering heights of Luis Bu\u00f1uel or Carrie Fisher. Through 52 episodes of television  \u2014   some of them, like that Kitty Genovese episode, marvelous  \u2014   \u201cGirls\u201d has never stopped looking for the grander, harsher psychological picture. It\u2019s never stopped looking for tough laughs. It fights   American absurdity with its own version of it, as it does in the final episode of the season, in which Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet, a crayon turning at last into a scalpel) rebrands Ray\u2019s coffee shop as a   haven for people who actually work  \u2014   that is, for \u201cadults,\u201d in other words. But in its highest gear, the show peerlessly vanishes the line between sociocultural satire and mental instability, between send up and crack up. That business with Hannah, Adam and Jessa closes the season with an unnerving cliffhanger. Hannah performs her pain for the storytellers\u2019 radio hour \u201cThe Moth,\u201d which obviously she takes to like a    to a flame. The night\u2019s theme is jealousy. In her tale, she proves she\u2019s overcome it by delivering a peace offering in the form of a fruit basket. But the story deepens and darkens a deranged argument that took place a few minutes earlier. Suddenly, Hannah\u2019s narcissism seems terroristic. Her personality disorder has the power to disorder other people\u2019s personalities. Maybe, she\u2019s the disorder. One of the last shots hovers about a demolished living room. But it\u2019s not exactly a cliffhanger for the show\u2019s next and final season. It\u2019s a   view of the wreckage in the canyon. Plus, there\u2019s something about the way the camera lingers on the basket outside the door that makes Hannah\u2019s offering seem more than a gift. It looks like a bomb.'"}, "time": 1742561642.0993083}
