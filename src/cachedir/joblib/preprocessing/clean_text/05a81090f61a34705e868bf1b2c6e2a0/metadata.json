[The report was based on a survey by the Queensland University of Technology, who used data from over 41, 000 participants between the ages of 18 and 80 that were using the Australian dating site RSVP.  \u201cWe looked at whether or not people actually contact people who match what they say is their ideal partner in their profile, and our findings show they don\u2019t,\u201d said Queensland University of Technology behavioral economist Stephen Whyte. \u201cStating a preference for what you are looking for appears to have little to no bearing on the characteristics of people you actually contact. \u201d \u201cDisclosure of \u2018ideal\u2019 partner preferences is a widely offered and   option for people creating a profile on online dating websites, but whether it\u2019s effective or useful in helping people find that special someone is unclear,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis study provides quite unique findings in that people may state a preference for an ideal partner but they are more than happy to initiate contact with potential love interests that bear no resemblance whatsoever to that \u2018Mr or Mrs Perfect\u2019 they initially think they prefer over all others. \u201d \u201cAs Internet and cyber dating continues to grow at a rapid rate further research is required into the   process and the links between stated preferences and actual choice,\u201d Whyte concluded. \u201cOur study reviewed the interactions of people whose ages ranged from millennials to octogenarians, which in itself demonstrates how widespread online dating is and how it is changing traditional ways in which people find potential love interests. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
