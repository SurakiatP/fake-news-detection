[More than 60 per cent of viewers found Mr. Macron more convincing than Ms. Le Pen in the debate, according to an opinion poll by Elabe for BFMTV.  Around 34 per cent, meanwhile, said the arguments of Ms. Le Pen were more persuasive. The former Front National leader has defied   polls in the past, however. In a survey by the same company after last month\u2019s debate with all the first round candidates, Ms. Le Pen received the smallest share of support for her vision for France, coming behind \u201c \u201d   Mel\u00e9nchon and   conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon. Ms. Le Pen went on to convincingly defeat both candidates in the first round of voting. Last night\u2019s debate was notably acrimonious, with both candidates deploying personal insults and attacks. Ms. Le Pen slammed the European Union (EU) and branded her competitor a \u201cdarling of the system\u201d. She also said: \u201cYou need to show a little less arrogance before the election. It seems to me that you try to treat them as children. \u201d Mr. Macron, meanwhile, said his rival was a \u201cparasite\u201d and \u201cliar\u201d who risked throwing the nation into civil war.'"}, "time": 1742561894.3660238}
