[In a small cafe in Paris\u2019s 13th district, leader of the Paris branch of G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire (GI) the French   migration Identitarian youth movement founded in 2012 who protest   and Islamisation, told Breitbart London his personal life has shaped his political leanings.  He said he and his brother were constantly harassed by men of foreign backgrounds simply for being French. \u201cSometimes there was violence, I was beaten because I was the only French on public transport or on the streets,\u201d explained Mr. Larti. Larti then described one incident in which he and his brother had a knife held to their throat by a man and robbed for no other reason than their ethnicity. According to the GI Paris chief, those types of experiences have become increasingly common for young people living in suburbs in the north of Paris. Women, in particular, he said, were targets for   men. \u201cThe conditions for women in France are terrible now. If you are a blonde woman in the north of Paris I  wouldn\u2019t give you five minutes without being harassed. \u201d The worsening conditions for women, along with the Cologne sex attacks in 2015, have brought many women into the movement, Larti said. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel [like you are] in your country anymore,\u201d he said adding, \u201cWe have the right to live in our country with our values. \u201d \u201cIn some areas of France, you have no more French natives. It\u2019s finished you know?\u201d   migration presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has advocated closing the borders and deporting known Islamic radicals, something that Larti supports, but believes does not go far enough to tackle the problems facing France. Larti said that he would like to see an eventual repatriation of those who refuse to accept French values which he claimed the government was working to systematically destroy. On the subject of the European Union, the GI leader said he was not against the EU as a concept, but was against the leadership of the political bloc. \u201cIn my point of view, the European countries are very united now. Not because of the EU, but because of mass immigration which is a threat to our life as a country, as a nation,\u201d he said. Aside from large, often spectacular protests, the group also engages in charity work during the winter months, in what they call \u201cSolidarity Generation\u201d by helping homeless Europeans in France.  Larti said many of the native French homeless are afraid of going to shelters full of migrants because they are often subjected to violence and so end up on the street with no one else to help them. Looking forward to Sunday\u2019s election between Ms. Le Pen and her globalist rival Emmanuel Macron, Larti said he feared things will only get worse if Macron wins. \u201cI still believe in political solutions, but for how long? I don\u2019t know, to be honest. If Emmanuel Macron wins the election, I am not sure. This is my personal opinion  \u2014   not of the organisation  \u2014   [but] for me, this is maybe the last election that we have. \u201d He noted terrorist attacks have dramatically escalated since the election of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande five years ago. \u201cIf Emmanuel Macron doesn\u2019t take any, or maybe Marine Le Pen, any powerful solutions, I don\u2019t believe that we can organise elections in the next five years,\u201d he said. Larti\u2019s view is similar to French Islamic scholar Gilles Kepel who has predicted that radical Islamists could lead Europe into a potential civil war.
