We all knew it was coming, but now it\u2019s official: The \u201cBrexit\u201d has begun. Prime Minister Theresa May invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, putting Britain on track to leave the European Union in 2019 and upending the order established after World War II. Here\u2019s what comes next in the country\u2019s march into the unknown. The bloc loses its   economy, and hard questions abound about whether the pivot toward nationalism and   marks the start of a more volatile global era. _____ 2. The United States and China appear likely to switch roles on environmental issues, thanks to President Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at undoing the Obama administration\u2019s climate change policies. China, despite its own dire air pollution, seems ready to push the U. S. to adhere to the 2015 Paris Agreement, which Mr. Trump has signaled he has no intention of doing. Today on The Daily podcast, we discuss Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back environmental rules. _____ 3. Leaders of the Senate investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s possible ties to Russia sought to distance themselves from the flagging House inquiry  \u2014   and present a unified political front. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee pledged to interview key players and press intelligence agencies to provide information. \u201cThis investigation\u2019s scope will go wherever the intelligence leads,\u201d said Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, above with Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. _____ 4. Ivanka Trump is becoming an official, though unpaid, federal employee. The move, which she says subjects her to federal rules, is meant to answer concerns over the ethics implications of her earlier unofficial role in her father\u2019s administration. The implications for her business are not immediately clear. Ms. Trump\u2019s title will be special assistant to the president. Her husband, Jared Kushner, has the title of senior adviser. _____ 5. \u201cAn outrageous abuse of power. \u201d  That was the judge who sentenced two figures in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d case, when lanes to the George Washington Bridge were closed to jam traffic in a New Jersey town whose mayor had refused to endorse Gov. Chris Christie for  . Bridget Anne Kelly, a former Christie aide, above, is to serve 18 months, and Bill Baroni, a former Christie ally at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is to serve two years. _____ 6. The Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly apologized to Representative Maxine Waters of California. He had called her hair \u201ca James Brown wig. \u201d But right after the mea culpa, he went on the attack, accusing her of demagogy for criticizing Mr. Trump. Ms. Waters declined to spar. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be put down, I\u2019m not going to go anywhere,\u201d she said on MSNBC. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay on the issues. \u201d _____ 7. We compiled tips on how to protect your privacy online, like using a VPN. They may come in handy, given Congress\u2019s decision to dismantle   rules that, had they been allowed to go into effect this year, would have required internet providers to get permission before collecting and selling customers\u2019 online information, including browsing activities. But our tech writer points out that you didn\u2019t have much online privacy to begin with. _____ 8. \u201cIt was never my intention to go against the president of the United States,\u201d said Mohamed Iye, a   American citizen whose wife and daughters were stranded abroad when the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban took effect. \u201cI was just following the law and doing everything the way it\u2019s in the books. And it came to this. \u201d Like more than 50 others, he has filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump over the ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries. (The second version of the ban is currently held up by rulings from federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland.) _____ 9. The supplies in many school nurses\u2019 offices include EpiPens for allergic reactions, inhalers for asthma  \u2014   and now naloxone, an antidote for opioid overdoses. As communities across the country face a deadly toll from heroin and pills, educators are increasingly worried. \u201cSome people worry that this says, \u2018Oh, there are drugs in the schools,\u2019\u201d said one school official. \u201cNo, there are drugs everywhere. \u201d _____ 10. Bob Dylan will accept his Nobel Prize for literature in Stockholm after all. On his terms. Mr. Dylan greeted news of the prize last fall with silence and skipped the December ceremony, citing   commitments. He\u2019s to receive the award this weekend in Stockholm, where he\u2019s playing two concerts. Members of the Academy \u201cwill show up at one\u201d and then hand over his medal privately, an academy spokesman wrote. \u201cAll according to Dylan\u2019s wishes. \u201d _____ 11. Finally, the cast of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d proposed a new strategy to save Meals on Wheels: deliver sandwiches via rocket launcher. And The Times\u2019s chief TV critic investigated the existential doubt caused by surreal shows, like FX\u2019s \u201cLegion,\u201d before its season finale airs tonight.
