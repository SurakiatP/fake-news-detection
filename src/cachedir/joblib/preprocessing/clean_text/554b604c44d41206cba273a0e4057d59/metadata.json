Trump\u2019s foreign policy prescriptions on Thursday, casting her likely Republican rival as a threat to decades of bipartisan tenets of American diplomacy and declaring him unfit for the presidency. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign aides said the speech, which she will deliver in San Diego, would be the start of a persistent assault to portray a potential Trump presidency as a dangerous proposition that would weaken American alliances and embolden enemies. The argument will include specific criticism of comments Mr. Trump has made about rethinking the United States\u2019s support of NATO his proposal to allow Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to acquire nuclear weapons his vow to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States and his pledge to advance the use of torture and kill the families of suspected terrorists. But Mrs. Clinton will also invoke her experiences as secretary of state, including in 2011 when she supported President Obama\u2019s decision to send Navy SEALs on a raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, to make the case that Mr. Trump does not have the temperament to make such decisions. \u201cDonald Trump is unlike any presidential candidate we\u2019ve seen, maybe ever, certainly in decades, in that he does not cross the threshold of fitness for the job,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top policy adviser, who helped draft the speech. Mrs. Clinton will deliver the address on her final campaign swing before California holds its Democratic primary on Tuesday, when she is widely expected to reach the threshold of delegates needed to secure her party\u2019s nomination. But in choosing to raise concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy stances, she will be speaking to swing voters in general election battleground states who have doubts about a Trump presidency. While Mrs. Clinton must be cautious not to alienate liberal Democrats who oppose some of her hawkish foreign policy stances, her campaign says national security could be the catalyst that drives independents and wavering Republicans to support her this fall. Roughly 21 percent of independent voters and 32 percent of Republican voters said the most important issue this election was terrorism and national security, compared with 16 percent of Democrats, according to a Suffolk   Today poll conducted last month. At the same time, 61 percent of registered voters said a Trump presidency would make America\u2019s image in the world worse, according to the latest New York   News poll. \u201cThere are many Republicans concerned about this,\u201d R. Nicholas Burns, an American ambassador to NATO during the George W. Bush administration who also served on Bill Clinton\u2019s National Security Council, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThey find his policy positions beyond the pale, and they\u2019re also turned off by his vulgarity. \u201d To that end, the Clinton campaign and its outside advisers have embarked on an effort to reach out to prominent moderate Republicans who could endorse Mrs. Clinton, largely making the case for foreign policy  . Those calls have included to an aide of the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, and to Nicholas F. Brady, who served as secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Reagan and the elder Mr. Bush, with plans to reach out to James A. Baker III, a White House chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan and secretary of state under President George Bush. In her debates with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton has defended her foreign policy decisions, including urging the Obama administration to join a   coalition to oust Col. Muammar   in Libya and her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq, which she later said was a mistake. In an interview Wednesday night, Mr. Trump criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s early support for the Iraq war, which he said he opposed, and questioned her judgment in Libya. \u201cBernie Sanders said it and I\u2019m going to use it all over the place because it\u2019s true,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe is a woman who is   to be president because she has bad judgment. \u201d As each candidate argues the other is unfit to occupy the Oval Office, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers are preparing to make a case against Mr. Trump that will be jarringly different from the sparring of past presidential campaigns over foreign policy. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the campaign against McCain or Romney, which was two competing visions,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former White House and Pentagon official under President Obama. Instead, he said, Mrs. Clinton will remind voters that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the North Korean government of Kim   have expressed support for Mr. Trump, who has suggested a willingness to talk directly with Mr. Kim, a pariah worldwide. Mrs. Clinton will also accuse Mr. Trump of bluster and oratory that is in direct opposition to the bipartisan pillars of American diplomacy that every president has adhered to since World War II. Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the United States rethink its involvement in NATO, the   coalition of European nations. Mrs. Clinton, she added, needed to explain to voters that \u201cevery single president over the last couple decades has understood the value of alliances\u201d and that \u201cplaying by the rules makes sense for all of us. \u201d Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was \u201cfraudulent\u201d in her misrepresentation of his foreign policy positions, explaining that he supported global alliances, but believed that the United States should shoulder less of the financial burden. \u201cOur country can\u2019t afford to protect the world anymore, and at least not get reimbursed for it,\u201d he said. Mrs. Clinton has delivered a series of foreign policy speeches over the course of the nominating fight that included calling for accelerating the   operation to defeat the Islamic State, ending the economic embargo against Cuba, and pledging unwavering support of Israel. And she had already begun to lay the groundwork against what she called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201creckless actions\u201d on foreign policy. The San Diego speech, to be delivered in a city known for its military presence at a time when Mr. Trump is facing scrutiny over his donations to veterans\u2019 groups, will present a more sweeping  \u2014   and fearsome  \u2014   portrayal of Mr. Trump, one that the Clinton campaign will deliver like a drumbeat to voters in the coming months. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of room left in terms of new proposals,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cThis is a speech about a vision and principle and purpose, not individual policy proposals. \u201d The prospect of a foreign policy debate not centered on policy differences has confounded Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers, who in a more traditional election would be facing questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s call for a   zone with coalition forces to protect Syrians or how she would handle the flood of migrants to Europe. But Mr. Trump, in addressing foreign policy, has largely relied on gut instinct and appealing to voters\u2019 emotional concerns that America has lost its standing in the world. \u201cYou do get the sense that he\u2019s in a dialogue with a part of the electorate  \u2014   and I consider it a minority  \u2014   that couldn\u2019t be less interested in facts or realities,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department under Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThat\u2019s a really challenging task that most of us were unprepared for in many ways. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564159.8054156}
