I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I\u2019ve been doing this for weeks straight. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you\u2019ll ask me that question. I think that\u2019s a very rude question, to be honest with you.\u201d \\nTrump can\u2019t defend why he is wasting precious time promoting his business interests instead of campaigning. Trump doesn\u2019t have a single campaign event scheduled until 7 PM. He has given up a critical day of campaign time to get publicity for his new hotel. \\nWhen Trump got called out for some very unpresidential scheduling priorities, his response was to attack the reporter. \\nThe Republican nominee is not behaving like a person who is willing to give everything to be elected the next president, and every time he leaves his Fox News bubble, Donald Trump opens his mouth and reminds voters of why he should never be elected president. \\nTrump Throws A Fit When Asked Why He Is Promoting His Hotel Instead Of Campaigning added by Jason Easley on Wed, Oct 26th, 2016'"}, "time": 1742564550.4303381}
