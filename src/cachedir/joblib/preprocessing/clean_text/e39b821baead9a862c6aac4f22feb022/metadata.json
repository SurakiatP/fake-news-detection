Trump said Thursday that he had reached out to the Carrier air conditioner company in Indiana to ask it not to move more than 2, 000 factory jobs from Indiana to Mexico. In a post on Twitter Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said: \u201cI am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A. C. Company to stay in the U. S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS   Will know soon!\u201d During both the primary and general election campaigns, Mr. Trump frequently cited the February decision by Carrier and its corporate parent, United Technologies, to close two Indiana factories and move production to Mexico as an example of how Nafta and other   agreements had failed American workers. In a recent New York Times article, workers at one plant in Indianapolis warned that they would withdraw their support for Mr. Trump if he did not keep his promise to bring back overseas jobs. The two plants  \u2014   a Carrier factory employing more than 1, 400 workers in Indianapolis and a United Technologies plant with 700 employees in Huntington  \u2014   are profitable, but pay workers $15 to $26 an hour  \u2014   about what the company\u2019s workers in Monterrey, Mexico, earn in a day. In a time of slow economic growth and intense pressure from Wall Street to improve profits, moving production south of the border seemed like too good of an opportunity for United Technologies\u2019 executives to pass up. However, a shaky video of the announcement on the Carrier factory floor  \u2014   and the furious reaction of workers  \u2014   went viral in February. It caught Mr. Trump\u2019s attention, prompting a furor throughout the campaign. In a tweet Thursday after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, Carrier confirmed that the   had reached out, but refused to say what steps, if any, management was now considering. \u201cCarrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together,\u201d the company said. \u201cNothing to announce at this time. \u201d For workers in Indianapolis, the Twitter exchange provided a ray of hope on an otherwise anxious Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cEveryone is posting about it on Facebook and there\u2019s a lot of excitement,\u201d said Paul Roell, who has worked at Carrier for 17 years and was an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Trump in the election. \u201cI\u2019m a little more optimistic now,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers are saying, let\u2019s see if he\u2019s really going to do this. \u201d \u201cI was very surprised to see it on Thanksgiving today,\u201d Mr. Roell added. \u201cI figured he\u2019d be like everyone else today, with his family, not thinking of Carrier. \u201d Earlier in the week, Indiana state officials had come to the factory to describe what benefits workers could expect as layoffs approach, Mr. Roell said. The first production lines are expected to shut down in August 2017. \u201cIf he can get them to stay here, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Robin Maynard, a Trump supporter. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he can get stuff done and also save me from having to look for a new job. \u201d Other workers, especially those who did not support Mr. Trump in the election, were more skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s baloney,\u201d said Jennifer   who has worked at Carrier for a decade and a half and earns over $21 an hour, well above what similar   jobs pay in the area. \u201cI could see him reaching out to Carrier, but I don\u2019t think anything will happen,\u201d said Ms.   who added that she \u201creluctantly\u201d voted for Hillary Clinton this month. \u201cHe can try and talk to them, and it\u2019s good that he mentioned it, but I think Carrier will still leave. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563587.2612576}
