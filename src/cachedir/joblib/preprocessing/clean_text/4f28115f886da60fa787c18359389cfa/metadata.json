After the FBI dropped the ball on the first investigation, they\u2019re redeeming themselves the second time around, and now it\u2019s out what she paid strange men $300 to do. \\nThe hits just keep on coming at Hillary. If she gets off the hook again this investigation in addition to everything WikiLeaks has released about her, then we know that there is something seriously corrupt with our government. \\nWorse yet would be if she\u2019s elected as president, which will force Americans to pay an exceptionally detrimental price for the next four years that could bring lasting implications. The man in this video knows who may have helped in that destructive outcome, done for a small fee that Hillary\u2019s campaign evidently handed out like candy for this cause at a halfway house in California. \\nMicroSpookyLeaks came forward with the footage they obtained, when they posted it to social media on Saturday which shows the unnamed person in this video admitting what Democrats were giving halfway house patients $300 to do for them. While this man in the video may not have accepted the payment himself, he\u2019s caught saying that Democrats are giving others in the house a $300 rebate check if they vote for Hillary in the state of California.

We can only imagine that if her party is willing to do this there, they hit up other places and people in key states to do the same. What\u2019s particular sick about it isn\u2019t just that they are fraudulently obtaining votes for this woman who can\u2019t get them on her own merit, it\u2019s that they are targeting vulnerable people to get them as part of the dishonest plan. \\nIf Hillary is able to continue on with this campaign and take the White House, Americans have the duty to demand how it happened since there\u2019s no way she could legitimately win. Had Donald Trump been caught bribing halfway house patients for votes or any of the other dishonest deeds leaked out about Hillary lately, the media would have exiled him from the election.'"}, "time": 1742628308.5654647}
