On Thursday, only two days into February, the coroner\u2019s office in Dayton, Ohio, had already handled 25 deaths  \u2014   18 caused by drug overdoses. In January, the office processed 145 cases in which the victims\u2019 bodies had been destroyed by opioids. Now, the Montgomery County Coroner\u2019s Office is so crammed with corpses that it has asked a local funeral parlor to take in four bodies for \u201ctemporary storage,\u201d the first time it has had to make such a request, Kenneth M. Betz, director of the coroner\u2019s office, said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re running at full capacity,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve never experienced this volume of accidental drug overdoses in our history. We now call funeral homes immediately\u201d to ask if there is space available, he added. Widespread abuse of powerful opioid pain relievers in the United States  \u2014   including oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone and fentanyl, heroin\u2019s cheaper but deadlier cousin  \u2014   has driven overdose death rates to historic highs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The C. D. C. \u2019s numbers show that 91 people in the United States die every day from opioid overdose. The number of bodies from accidental overdoses that have come to the Montgomery County Coroner\u2019s Office in the first 33 days of the year  \u2014   163  \u2014   is already more than half the yearly totals for the past two years. In 2015, the total was 259 last year, the number of deaths from January to September was 253,  figures from the office show. In Ohio, fatal overdoses more than quadrupled in the past decade and by 2007 had surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of accidental death, according to the Department of Health. In 2015, 3, 310 deaths were recorded in the state from unintentional drug overdoses, a 21. 5 percent increase from the previous year, according to the C. D. C. Addiction is so entrenched and widespread that police officials say there are now third and fourth generations of prescription drug abusers. These days, hospitals in Cincinnati require drug testing of new mothers and infants because of a surge in newborns exposed to addictive drugs. The five states with the highest rates of death linked to drug overdose were West Virginia (41. 5 per 100, 000) New Hampshire (34. 3 per 100, 000) Kentucky (29. 9 per 100, 000) Ohio (29. 9 per 100, 000) and Rhode Island (28. 2 per 100, 000) according to the C. D. C. But significant increases were also seen in the Northeast and the South, the agency said, including Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Last year, Mr. Betz said Montgomery County\u2019s coroner\u2019s office had to use refrigerated trucks to store bodies for a week. In his 40 years in forensics, Mr. Betz said, he has never seen such a steady increase in overdose deaths, and it has left him and his colleagues feeling overwhelmed. \u201cOur staff is, quite frankly, tired,\u201d he said. \u201cThe doctors are tired. The investigators are tired. We\u2019ve never had volumes like this. \u201d \u201cThis increase from year to year  \u2014   I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe drug problem we have is absolutely phenomenal. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564511.5721867}
