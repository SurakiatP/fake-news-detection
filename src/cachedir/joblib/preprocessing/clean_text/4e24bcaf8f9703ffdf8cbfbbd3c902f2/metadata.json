Demonstrators say they were trying to occupy land just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation where construction of the controversial pipeline is scheduled. \\nThis was the first significant clash between law enforcement and protesters since demonstrations turned violent last week and more than 100 people were arrested. \\nAccording to the Morton County, N.D., Sheriff\u2019s Department, a group of people began building a wood pedestrian bridge across a creek north of the main protest camp early Wednesday morning. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers owns the land and had asked law enforcement to remove any protesters who try to reach it. \\nOfficers in boats pulled the makeshift bridge apart and warned protesters they would be arrested if they continued to trespass. After a several-hour standoff with police, protesters dispersed and returned to their main camp. \\nDuring the standoff, a few protesters watched from across the nearby Cannonball River. They waded into the water \u2014 some chest-deep \u2014 to shout support for colleagues closer to officers. \\n\u201cI decided to get into the river and just be a presence there,\u201d says Stephanie Jasper of Tampa Bay, Fla. She watched as law enforcement pushed protesters back toward the main camp, and says she saw officers use pepper spray. She says it was a chaotic sight as a police helicopter hovered overhead. \\nSeveral protesters standing in the river held mirrors directed at law enforcement officers lined up on the other side and at police on the river in boats. \\n\u201cEverybody was just sharing love to these officers and explaining why it is we\u2019re here and questioning why they were,\u201d says Jasper. \\nOne law enforcement official had a very different view of the protest. \u201cIn my 27 years in law enforcement, I have never seen such an absolute disregard for the law or other people\u2019s rights because of someone else\u2019s ideology,\u201d said Cass County, N.D., Sheriff Paul Laney. \\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says the Dakota Access Pipeline construction route crosses land that is sacred to its members. And the tribe worries a pipeline spill could pollute local water. The tribe wants the federal government to stop work on the pipeline and conduct a full environmental impact study of the pipeline. \\nThe Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department says one person was arrested for \u201cconspiracy to commit obstruction of a government function.\u201d In a press release, the agency says the protester was buying canoes and kayaks for others to cross the creek.'"}, "time": 1742564393.8909998}
