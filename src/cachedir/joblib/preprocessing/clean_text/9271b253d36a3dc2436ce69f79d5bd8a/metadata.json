[The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) is launching a collaboration with Planned Parenthood and a campaign to raise awareness of and support for the abortion industry giant with a pink pin that states, \u201cFashion Stands with Planned Parenthood\u201d:  Fashion stands with @PPFA! Check out https:  .  for the full story on our new exciting partnership. #IStandWithPP pic. twitter.   \u2014   CFDA (@CFDA) February 6, 2017,  The pins were designed by The Creative Group, Cond\u00e9 Nast, and will be distributed throughout the industry in time for New York Fashion Week, which begins Thursday, says CFDA. Steven Kolb, CFDA president and CEO,  said supporting Planned Parenthood is a \u201ccivic responsibility. \u201d \u201cDefunding Planned Parenthood will impact millions of Americans,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will raise awareness and support this fashion week and show that Fashion Stands with Planned Parenthood. \u201d According to CFDA, more than 40 designers and brands are participating in the campaign, \u201cincluding Diane von Furstenberg, Carolina Herrera, Cushnie et Ochs, Public School, Jonathan Simkhai, kate spade new york, Rosetta Getty, Proenza Schouler, Mara Hoffman, Narciso Rodriguez, Milly, Prabal Gurung, Tory Burch, and Zac Posen. \u201d \u201cWe are truly thrilled by the Council of Fashion Designers of America\u2019s show of support for Planned Parenthood at New York Fashion Week,\u201d said Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards in response. \u201cPlanned Parenthood has stood defiantly in the face of opposition for a century, and we\u2019re not backing down now. \u201d \u201cThe American people overwhelmingly support our organization and strongly oppose \u2018defunding\u2019 care at our health centers,\u201d she continued. \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s millions of supporters, including the CFDA, are mobilizing to protect access to reproductive health and rights for everyone, including the 2. 5 million patients we serve, and we will continue to fight to ensure that all people can get the care they need. \u201d However, a recent Marist poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 40 percent of those who say they are \u201c\u201d and 41 percent of Democrats. The House recently approved the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, a measure that would permanently prohibit taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions and would make the Hyde Amendment permanent across all federal expenditures. \u201cHouse passage of this legislation is the first step towards fulfilling a promise made by President Trump to keep taxpayers out of the abortion business,\u201d said   Susan B. Anthony President Marjorie Dannenfelser. \u201cHe and his administration are working for the American people, not the abortion lobby. We urge the U. S. Senate to follow suit so that this bill can get to President Trump\u2019s desk as soon as possible. \u201d According to NYMag. com, CFDA board member Tracy Reese said, \u201cSo many people stand with Planned Parenthood  \u2014   including designers and entertainers  \u2014   because they and their loved ones have relied on Planned Parenthood for health care, including   care like cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment and sex education. \u201d \u201cPlanned Parenthood is often the only option for this type of care in underserved communities,\u201d she added. \u201cBy creating a visually engaging and fashionable pin, we hope to create an organic social media movement promoting awareness and education. \u201d Planned Parenthood, however, does not provide mammograms, and in  a new video series,   group Live Action is challenging the abortion business\u2019s claim that it provides \u201c  care. \u201d Live Action\u2019s investigators seeking \u201c  care\u201d contacted 97 Planned Parenthood clinics across the country and were told at 92 of them that \u201c  services\u201d were not available. Similarly, investigators discovered that Planned Parenthood staff members admitted ultrasounds are only done prior to abortions and not for   care. \u201cThe reality is Planned Parenthood\u2019s focus for pregnant women is abortion,\u201d Live Action President Lila Rose said at a press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not   care. It\u2019s not serving young mothers, promoting them, supporting them it\u2019s abortion. \u201d   leaders and members of Congress also point out that federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) provide more comprehensive medical and family planning services than Planned Parenthood to   women and families. Nationally, there are 13, 000 FQHCs  \u2014   a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities by 20 to 1. Republicans plan to redirect Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer funding to these thousands of other health centers that do not provide abortion. Planned Parenthood receives more than a   dollars in taxpayer funding annually and performs an excess of 300, 000 abortions per year.'"}, "time": 1742561725.14639}
