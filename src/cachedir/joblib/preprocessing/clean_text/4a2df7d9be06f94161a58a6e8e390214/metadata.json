THE MEDIA. \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 27, 2016 \\nSome would argue that the so-called \\'mainstream media\\' has carried Obama\\'s water for eight years. Yet, they\\'re to blame for the ObamaCare trainwreck? Yup. \\nObama told more than 25,000 volunteers on a White House call: \\n\"We\\'re not going to get that much help from the media. This is going to be a ground game. \\nThere is a faction of people who are continually trying to root for failure, despite the fact that we keep on insuring people and folks continue to get help.\" \\nThat \u201cfaction of people\u201d is a majority of Americans, by the way. Here\\'s what a recent Gallup poll found: \\n51% disapprove of the law; 44% approve \\n18% say it has helped their families; 29% say it has hurt them \\nLong term, most Americans believe it will hurt or not make a difference \\nAnyway, Obama told the volunteers that they\\'ll have to help him \u201cclear the mud off the windshield\u201d to get people to sign up\u2014 mud presumably put there by the media. \\nSpeaking of the media, Townhall\\'s Guy Benson and The Daily Caller\\'s Derek Hunter were a bit \\'skeptical\\' of Obama\\'s charge: The press is sending those premium hike letters, canceling people\\'s plans, and forcing insurers out of the exchanges?? Wow! ???? #whining https://t.co/0b2ffrdX7I \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) October 28, 2016 Yesterday it was Republicans\\' fault, now it\\'s the media. Total number of media and Republicans who voted for/had any input in Obamacare = 0. https://t.co/rGjeM95bL4 \u2014 Derek Hunter (@derekahunter) October 28, 2016 \\nAs were other Twitterers: Oh. I guess the press wrote a dumpster fire law, passed it with trickery in the middle of night, after lying about it. Interesting take. https://t.co/kvVjLaIKZT '"}, "time": 1742562034.5882123}
