Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star \u2018s Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump\u2019s lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . \\nThere are literally hundreds of lies in Trump\u2019s speeches. They\u2019re not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. \\nIs there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she\u2019s actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. \\nThe Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton\u2019s policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton\u2019s record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons\u2019 corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump\u2019s endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama\u2019s record, The campaign, Russia, Trump\u2019s record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton\u2019s health and Government corruption. \\nThey also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, \u201cThe electoral system is rigged.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s rigged against him: \\n\u201cAfter plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. \u2018Rigged\u2019 became his catchword. \\nHe claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired \u2018thugs\u2019 to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis \u2014 cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. \\nIn Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don\u2019t trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice.\u201d \\nNobody\u2019s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. \\nAnother is, \u201cMuslims are risky.\u201d This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: \\n\u201cHis claims that Syrian refugees \u2014 99 per cent are Muslim \u2014 are terrorists plays to the fears of the \u201cother,\u201d even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump\u2019s claims \u2014 about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016.\u201d \\n\u201cThe polls favour Trump.\u201d Har de har har \u2013 Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they\u2019re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: \\n\u201cIt seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This \u2018poll denialism\u2019 gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. \\nHis false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling \u2014 and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. \\nOn Oct. 24, he said \u2018I won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.\u2019 In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. \\nOf course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote \u2014 and exaggerate \u2014 those numbers.\u201d \\nBut these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also: Falsely said on Twitter, \u201cThe failing NYTimes reporters don\u2019t even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!\u201d Falsely said, \u201cBy \u2018open borders,\u2019 [Hillary] means totally unlimited immigration.\u201d Falsely said, \u201cHillary\u2019s plan includes an open border with the Middle East.\u201d Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, \u201ca Democrat.\u201d Falsely said, \u201cWow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible.\u201d Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran \u201c$150 billion\u201d as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, \u201cIn San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people\u2026Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.\u201d Falsely asserted that Clinton has \u201cbeen fighting ISIS (her) entire adult life.\u201d Falsely said, \u201cAll together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.\u201d Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO \u201cobsolete because it doesn\u2019t cover terror;\u201d falsely suggested NATO created an anti-terror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didn\u2019t release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him \u201chave been largely debunked.\u201d Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, \u201cThe one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense.\u201d Falsely said \u201cI did not. I did not\u201d to Clinton\u2019s charge that he thinks Climate change is a \u201choax perpetrated by the Chinese.\u201d Falsely said, \u201cI was against going into Iraq. And it\u2019s so well-documented.\u201d Falsely said, \u201cOur taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world.\u201d \\nAnd so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, he\u2019ll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper\u2019s lying, and continue to sell the myth that he\u2019s not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies. \\nTo see the full list and detailed analysis, click here . \\nFeatured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images Share this Article!
