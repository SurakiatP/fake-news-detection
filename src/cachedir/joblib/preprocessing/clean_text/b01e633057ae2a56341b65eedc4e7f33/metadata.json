Krypto, as you might know is the Super Dog, from Krypton. \\nDoggie Nair, the chairdog of AKMSD says that Krypto is their last hope. \u201cNobody else seems to be doing anything for us, irrespective of Menaka Gandhi voicing her support. By the way, I didn\u2019t know she was from BJP \u2013 I thought all Gandhis were from Congress, and thought she would help, but alas!\u201d he said. \\nAccording to sources, the AKMSD had even reached out to President Vladimir Putin during the recent BRICS summit to see how Russia interacts with stray dogs. Moved by their plight, Putin had called upon the Kerala CM and had referenced Kashtanka, the Russian children story by Anton Chekhov about stray dogs, and tried to argue their case. However, the Kerala CM was unmoved, and said that constant attacks from POK (\u201cPatti Occupied Kerala\u201d) [Patti in Malayalam \u2013 Dogs] was not acceptable, and he would keep conducting his surgical stikes attacks. (Off the record: He says the leadership in Kerala still try avoid the \u201cstrike\u201d word, else the GDP of Kerala would drop a few basis points). \\n\u201cI should have gone to school, when I was young,\u201d rued Doggie Nair. \u201cThen I would also be in Kareena Kapoor or Shilpa Shetty\u2019s lap, but now look at my job! I\u2019m living a dog\u2019s life!\u201d \\nWe feel for these dogs, and hope a real life Krypto comes to the rescue. \\n(Reported by Citizen Satirist Badri Narayanan )'"}, "time": 1742561674.8631861}
