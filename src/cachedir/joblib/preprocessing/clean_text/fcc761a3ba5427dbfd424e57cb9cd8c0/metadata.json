This happened only days after texting his mother about investigating if something happened to him. \\nMax Spiers, a 39-year-old father of two was found dead on a sofa in Poland, where he was invited to speak on conspiracy theories and UFOs. This happened in July and, since then, no post-mortem examination were carried out on his body. The death was ruled to be from \u2018natural causes\u2019. \\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013 \\nDays before his death, Spiers texted his mom: \\n\u201cYour boy\u2019s in trouble. If something happens to me, investigate\u201d. \\nSpiers, who claimed to be a survivor of a secret government \u2018super soldier\u2019 program, died suddenly after vomiting \u2018black liquid\u2019. His mother Vanessa Bates, an English teacher, told journalists: \\n\u201cHe was making a name for himself in the world of conspiracy theorists and had been invited to speak at a conference in Poland in July. He was staying with a woman who he had not known for long and she told me how she found him dead on the sofa. But I think Max had been digging in some dark places and I fear that somebody wanted him dead.\u201d\u2013 The Telegraph, UFO expert Max Spiers\u2019 death prompts conspiracy theories \\nBates believes that Spiers might have been poisoned. \\n\u201cMax was a very fit man who was in good health. All I have is a death certificate from the Polish authorities that it was from natural causes, but no post-mortem was done so how can they tell that? \\nThey are also refusing to release any paperwork about it to me because, absurdly, I don\u2019t have his written permission. \\nHe has a brother, Josh, and sister, Becky, who are both devastated, as are his two boys. We all want answers to this and I will continue to fight to get to the truth.\u201d\u2013 Ibid. \\nSpiers\u2019 financ\u00e9 Sarah Adams told Yahoo! News that he was about to expose \u2018black magic\u2019 and well known politicians and celebrities. \u201cWe were used to getting death threats or stuff like that from people but I think this time it seemed rather real. He\u2019d been sent threats saying that him and me were going to die. He was going to expose black magic. He was going to expose some of the stuff that he was working on involving political leaders and celebrities. He planned on coming back here seeing his family and I was going to have his child. He had messaged me hours before. It definitely couldn\u2019t have been anything like suicide or something like that.\u201d\u2013 Yahoo! News, Here\u2019s what conspiracy theorist Max Spiers was about to reveal before his death North East Kent coroner\u2019s office said that an investigation into Mr Spiers\u2019 death was in its \u201cvery early\u201d stages. Was Spiers\u2019 poisoned because he knew too much? Was he about to say too much? One thing is for sure, this death cannot be more suspicious.'"}, "time": 1742562620.732897}
