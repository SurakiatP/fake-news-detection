To see how our readers reacted to Donald Trump\u2019s request that Russian intelligence hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s email, our   on story ever, go here. 1. I am thinking about my mother tonight, the child of immigrants, born in 1919 just when women were given the right to vote. I am remembering all the times she dragged me into the voting booth to show me what a privilege it was to be an American and to live in this country. I can\u2019t talk to her about this historic night, but I can talk to my daughter who can see that her future is limitless. Almost 100 years in the making. It\u2019s been a long time coming.  \u2014   Ann in Connecticut, reacting to an article about Hillary Clinton accepting her party\u2019s presidential nomination, the first woman from a major party to do so. This comment received more than 900 reader recommendations.  2. I think we don\u2019t remember how recently women weren\u2019t allowed to wear pants, or couldn\u2019t attend Ivy League schools. Somehow we failed to pass these stories on to our daughters as we sought to give them all the opportunities of their male counterparts. Now the sexism is often more subtle, more hidden and our daughters take their opportunities for granted. \u201cI\u2019d like a woman, just not this woman. \u201d There isn\u2019t a mythical, perfect woman running. There is a human woman running, sometimes making mistakes, sometime enduring private pain publicly, sometimes soaring to the highest levels of achievement. Let\u2019s not hold her to a standard of perfection we wouldn\u2019t apply to a man running for president, let\u2019s honor her humanity and success as the first woman to achieve the nomination of a major party.  \u2014   Ellie in Boston. 3. One of the best things to come of this election is the fact that the G. O. P. has been forced to examine the monster which has been allowed to grow in its midst. I firmly believe that something similar is required on the Left. Hillary Clinton is no monster like Trump, but she is the calcification of a   version of what is wrong with politics today: the intransigence and pandering, the corruption and secrecy, the influence of big money, and a    the     approach to an entitled sense of rulership. The Democratic Party has a chance to see what its Bernie contingent is pointing out to party leadership. Were the G. O. P. candidate any better than a buffoon, it would be easier for the mainstream Left to see what is wrong with Hillary. It has nothing whatsoever to do with her gender. The D. N. C. \u2019s treatment of Bernie Sanders and his supporters has alienated me to a degree I didn\u2019t think possible.  \u2014   Kelvin F. in the Pacific Northwest. This comment received more than 970 reader recommendations and more than 300 reader responses. 4. As a Sanders supporter, I will not be voting for Hillary. At this point, I\u2019m left deciding between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, who, like Bernie, were both actually against the Iraq war before it started. Or, perhaps, just staying home. I am not alone. The two major candidates are the least popular in history, and the biggest reason their supporters give for voting for them is that they aren\u2019t the other one. I\u2019m resigned to having a terrible president starting next January, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be responsible for electing him or her.  \u2014   Mike in New York. This comment had more than 320 reader recommendations. 5. I love the fact that people are outraged not because the White House was built by slaves, but because someone dared to bring it up.  \u2014   Molly Maxine on The Times\u2019s Facebook page, responding to an article about Michelle Obama\u2019s speech at the Democratic convention, in which she said of the White House, \u201cI wake up every morning in a house built by slaves. \u201d  This comment received 60 likes. 6. To those morally outraged commenters who are threatening to not vote  \u2014   or to vote for Jill Stein, or Barney Fife, or whomever they imagine will represent some kind of integrity on their part  \u2014   because they\u2019re shocked and dismayed at the revelation that somehow the D. N. C. is \u201crigged,\u201d I say the following: Everything is rigged! Life is rigged! You will encounter it in every endeavor. Sometimes, it will serve you unfairly, sometimes it will discriminate against you unfairly  \u2014   but it\u2019ll always be there. There is no pure, sterile laboratory environment when it comes to human beings and their comings and goings. Clinton and Sanders are subject to exactly the same dynamics as you and I are as far as that goes. To assume any higher order is  \u2014   sorry  \u2014   to be naive. One of the first lessons a child learns is that life isn\u2019t fair. If they don\u2019t learn it, if they don\u2019t accept it and move forward knowing it, they\u2019ll be disappointed at almost every turn.  \u2014   Sean in New Orleans, reacting to an article about Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepping down as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee after an email leak revealed party leaders seeking to damage Senator Sanders\u2019s campaign.  7. You know, I\u2019ve often wondered how people who are falsely accused feel after the truth comes to light. Relieved? Vindicated? Righteous? At peace? Supporters of Bernie Sanders have spent close to half a year being told we\u2019re conspiracy theorists, that we\u2019re paranoid, unhinged, entitled whiners unable to face the reality that \u201call is well, our guy\u2019s just a loser. \u201d Learning that the D. N. C. did indeed actively collude to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination should make me feel something, shouldn\u2019t it? The evidence is there for even the most stubborn of skeptics to behold: the odds were never in Bernie\u2019s favor and his supporters were right to question the D. N. C. \u2019s impartiality. But I don\u2019t feel anything. I just feel empty. There are so many days left in this election. There\u2019s a monstrous creature that must be defeated at all costs. I just wish it felt like my party was one of the good guys.  \u2014   Danielle in Seattle. This comment received more than 1, 900 reader recommendations and more than 70 reader responses. 8. Once again, no one is held responsible for the death of an innocent black man. Society and the justice system [are] more ready to find excuses to exonerate when a black life is involved, because somehow he is seen as less valuable. Then, a society without equal empathy for all is surprised to see protests and violence in the streets. In the long term, injustice and peace are not mutually inclusive in any society, as history repeatedly teaches.  \u2014   Merlin in Atlanta, reacting to an article about the state\u2019s attorney dropping all remaining charges against the three Baltimore police officers awaiting trial in the death of Freddie Gray. This comment received more than 80 reader recommendations. 9. Addiction is a disease. Naloxone was no more invented to \u201ccure\u201d it than insulin was invented to \u201ccure\u201d diabetes. The key, and unexamined, phrase in this article is \u201cseek treatment\u201d: where are all those sick people supposed to take their illness when states like mine (with the money to make better choices) are closing rehab clinics like the one that saved my friend when she began her recovery six years ago? Today she is a vibrant counselor to young people. If anyone ever gave YOU a second chance, you ought to reopen your closed mind when it comes to addiction.  \u2014   Megan Macomber in New Haven, reacting to an article about naloxone, a drug that revives someone who has overdosed on opioids. Critics of the drug say it offers addicts a safety net advocates say it offers a path to treatment and recovery. 10. Based on my experience in marketing management at Verizon, I\u2019d say this will be a case of the blind leading the blind. Verizon has so much money to burn  \u2014   but no real strategy in the consumer space. They\u2019ve never really \u201cgotten\u201d the   thing and this is not a company that takes a lot of risk. By the time they got FiOS up and running, the business model for TV consumption was already changing. My guess is that will be a few years of   efforts to launch new \u201cproducts,\u201d and then they\u2019ll sell the entire consumer side of the business.  \u2014   Pat B. in Blue Bell, Pa. reacting to an article about Verizon\u2019s purchase of Yahoo\u2019s core internet business for $4. 8 billion.
