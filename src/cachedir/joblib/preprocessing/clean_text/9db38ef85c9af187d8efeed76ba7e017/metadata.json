More than 100 Brioni neckties. A fur coat that had been a gift from the Onassis family. Two bronze urns that had been in the trunk, and their precious contents. And a 1977 New York Yankees World Series ring, a personal gift from George Steinbrenner. It was inscribed, \u201cTo my friend, Bill White. \u201d That would be Bill White, the philanthropist and former chief executive of the Intrepid Sea, Air  Space Museum. The same Bill White who hosted a   with President Obama in his home in 2014. Guests included Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Aretha Franklin and Mark Wahlberg. He spoke on Tuesday by telephone from the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where he was attending the Clinton campaign\u2019s   events, the outcome still unknown. But amid the excitement Mr. White, 49, sounded like just another New Yorker angry at himself. \u201cThis is the tale of three idiots, and I\u2019m all three of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI get it. \u201d On Nov. 2, Mr. White had parked the truck outside his building in Manhattan around 2 a. m. after having dinner with his husband, Bryan Eure. He had loaded a lot of property and memorabilia, like photographs of Barbara Walters with Yitzhak Rabin aboard the Intrepid, into the G. M. C. Yukon to take to his office later that day. And the vehicle contained something more precious, he said: the cremated remains of his parents, inside those bronze urns. The vehicle\u2019s windows were tinted, and everything inside was covered, so he felt it was safe to leave his belongings there for the trip the next morning. \u201cLike an absolute idiot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve left my car on the street for 15 years and never had it broken into. \u201d A familiar figure in social and political circles in the city, Mr. White guided the Intrepid through financial troubles during his five years as president. He resigned abruptly in 2010, and was under investigation by Andrew M. Cuomo, then the state attorney general, for his role in   for Alan G. Hevesi, the former state comptroller. That same year, he settled and agreed to pay $1 million to the state. He knows a lot of people. When he had seen that the S. U. V. was gone that morning, Mr. White picked up the phone and called the police. Sort of. \u201cI called Commissioner Bratton,\u201d he said, referring to the city\u2019s former police commissioner, William J. Bratton. \u201cAnd Ray Kelly,\u201d who was Mr. Bratton\u2019s predecessor. \u201cI even texted my friend Bill de Blasio. \u201d The vehicle was recovered on East 89th Street in Canarsie, Brooklyn. It was taken to a police lot for processing and fingerprinting. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to tell me, what\u2019s in the car? \u2019\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThey said, \u2018A sock.\u2019 That\u2019s when I lost it. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get my parents back,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThe other stuff, you can live without. \u201d The police released an image from a surveillance camera of a man stepping out of the Yukon, but it showed no sign of the property. Did he stop along the way and dump it somewhere? What could he have done with the urns? \u201cI think he thought it was gold,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cHe opened it and saw dust. \u201d Mr. White\u2019s father, William J. White, died in 2015 and was cremated. His son, an only child, said they were very close and had spoken every day, and that it continued after the father\u2019s death. \u201cPeople will think that\u2019s weird, and I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cI used to drive him around. \u201d He kept the remains in the trunk area, out of sight. His mother, Patricia White, died in September. Mr. White placed her remains beside her husband\u2019s. \u201cUntil I think about what to do with them, I want them to be with me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m in the car a lot. \u201d He planned to have both urns placed under a memorial bench with his parents\u2019 names inscribed on it, in a park in Point Lookout, N. Y. where they had lived. The thief can keep the rest, he said. Even the ring. Once, in 2008, Mr. White was talking on his phone when a stranger approached and asked, \u201cWhere the hell did you get that ring?\u201d It was Reggie Jackson, who said, \u201cI was on that team, my friend, and you definitely were not. \u201d Mr. White just wants the urns. His parents\u2019 names are inscribed on them. \u201cI\u2019m in a state of depression over it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he\u2019s just returning the urns, then I will not press charges, and if he wants $25, 000, I\u2019ll give it to him,\u201d Mr. White said. He said goodbye, and returned to the Clinton event.'"}, "time": 1742563537.6819654}
