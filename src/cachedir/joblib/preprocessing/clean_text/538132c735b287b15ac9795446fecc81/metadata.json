Trump told the cheering crowd: \\n\u201cGreat guy, great friend of mine \u2014 great, great champion. Unbelievable winner. He called today and he said, \u2018Donald, I support you, you\u2019re my friend, and I voted for you. And I said, \u2018So Tom. You voted for me, you support me, am I allowed to say it tonight at this massive crowd in New Hampshire?\u2019 He said, \u2018If you want to say it, you can say it.\u2019 OK? Tom, that\u2019s what a champ is all about.\u201d \\nWatch Trump\u2019s embarrassing display of buddy name-dropping here: \\nBut there are a couple of problems with this glowing endorsement. Just hours before, on Boston\u2019s \u201cKirk & Callahan Show\u201d on WEEI Tom Brady said he hadn\u2019t voted yet. Since early voting in Massachusetts ended Friday, he could not have voted in the hours between the show and the phone call, unless he mailed his ballot in, which is highly unlikely. \\nBut what is most damning is an exchange his wife, supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, had on her Instagram page on Friday. \\nWhen a follower asked, \u201cGisele I heard you and Tom were backing Trump! Is that true???\u201d \\nGisele responded with a resounding, \u201cNO!\u201d \\nHere is the exchange as posted on Twitter by Chris Sacca: Three days ago on Instagram, @giseleofficial told a random dude she and Brady weren't backing Donald. \ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/oiAcUgqkKK \\n\u2014 Chris Sacca (@sacca) November 8, 2016 \\nGranted, it is possible Tom Brady lied to Trump. Tom isn\u2019t exactly known for his honesty, having been suspended for the first four games of this NFL season for cheating in the now infamous Deflategate Scandal . \\nEither way, Gisele\u2019s posting speaks volumes about who she and her husband WILL be voting for. Perhaps ending the Brady-Trump bromance for good. \\nFeatured image via Fernanda Calfat/Stringer/Getty Images Share this Article!\""}, "time": 1742562105.0455751}
