In the book, she reportedly reveals that Ailes targeted her as well as many of the other women at Fox News. The harassment took place early on during Kelly\u2019s time at Fox News, beginning in 2005. The managing editor came to her and told her that she had \u201ccaptured the attention of Mr. Ailes.\u201d She would soon learn just what this meant during the first of several meetings at his office in Manhattan. \\n\u201cRoger began pushing the limits,\u201d she alleges. \u201cThere was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger\u2019s office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me \u2014 veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the \u2018very sexy bras\u2019 I must have and how he\u2019d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.\u201d \\nBut things didn\u2019t stop there. Radar reports : \\n\u201cHe offered to advance her career \u2018in exchange for sexual favors,\u2019 she writes, and even though she says she rejected \u2018every single one,\u2019 she claims he tried \u2018physical advances.'\u201d \\n\u201cBut in January 2006, she claims, he \u2018crossed a new line \u2014 trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.\u2019 When she shoved him away, she alleges, \u2018he asked me an ominous question: \u2018When is your contract up?\u2019 And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me.\u2019 \u201d \\nKelly stayed conspicuously quiet when former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson came forward and filed a lawsuit against Ailes accusing him of sexual harassment. In her book, Kelly says that Ailes launched an \u201cintense campaign\u201d to convince her to speak out on his behalf when Carlson first filed her claim against him. \\n\u201cI was approached several times, and several times I refused,\u201d she writes. \u201cThere was no way I was going to lie to protect him.\u201d \\nThe revelation confirms what most of us already assumed. After all, it wasn\u2019t likely that a dirty old man like Ailes would go after so many other women at the network and not target the pretty young starlet. Until now, though, this had not been confirmed by Kelly. She said in her book that she finally decided it was time to speak out, even though there could be serious consequences. \\n\u201cCrossing him was a major risk,\u201d she said, \u201cbut what if \u2014 God forbid \u2014 he was still doing it to someone?\u201d \\nThe passages regarding Ailes were reportedly added to the book after the rest of it had been completed. The book\u2019s publisher is HarperCollins, which is owned by the same media company as Fox, who fired Ailes after Carlson filed suit against him. \\nRadar also noted that Kelly has stressed \u201cthat though she rebuffed all of his advances, he [Ailes] never went through with his implied threat of revenge. Instead, he promoted her.\u201d \\nFeatured image via Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc Share this Article!\""}, "time": 1742561857.7056713}
