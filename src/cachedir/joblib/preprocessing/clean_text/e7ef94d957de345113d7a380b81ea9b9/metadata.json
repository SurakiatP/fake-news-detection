But now that the obvious has grown too hard to deny, their tactics are changing. Now, all of a sudden, ESPN\u2019s liberal bias is a good thing. [Until now, ESPN and its hosts have repeatedly denied that it has a liberal bias problem. Last year ESPN ombudsman Jim Brady published an investigation into the claim of liberal bias that ran thousands of words only to reach the conclusion that there was no liberal bias.  But that wasn\u2019t all the question so vexed the network that it hired a polling firm to find out if there is any liberal bias and, if so, has it hurt the network\u2019s ratings. Unsurprisingly, the survey bought and paid for by ESPN miraculously showed that there was no liberal bias at the network. ESPN\u2019s survey, though, flies in the face of three other surveys that did find that the network has a liberal bias problem and that the constant   content is driving viewers away. Many liberal members of the sports media, such as Awful Announcing\u2019s Andrew Bucholtz, joined ESPN to   any notion that the network has a liberal bias problem. But there seems to be a changeup in the discussion as at least one liberal sportsman is now saying ESPN\u2019s dive into liberalism is a good thing for the network that is losing 10, 000 subscribers a month. According to Ty Duffy of Awful Announcing, ESPN\u2019s liberal bias is a good thing because it will bring in young, liberal fans. \u201cThere is truth in the liberal claim. ESPN has tilted leftward under John Skipper,\u201d Duffy initially observed. Despite that admission, Duffy goes on to claim there is \u201cno proof\u201d that conservative fans have abandoned ESPN over its constant   content. Naturally Duffy ignored the three surveys that serve as proof of conservative discontent and relied only on ESPN\u2019s bought and paid for survey to \u201cprove\u201d his contention. But even as he offers no statistical proof to buttress his own claim, Duffy insists that ESPN\u2019s drive leftward is a shrewd move because it will bring young, \u201cwoke\u201d viewers to replace the fleeing conservative audience. Major brands, such as ESPN, are now expected to exhibit a political and social consciousness. They pay a cost when they are tone deaf. If there are now two Americas, ESPN (and sports leagues) will move with the one advertisers want to reach: young people, people with disposable income, and growing minority populations. Of course, Duffy indulges gross generalizations. Only far   liberals \u201cexpect\u201d major brands to \u201cexhibit a political and social consciousness. \u201d Even if that is the case, he also seems to simply assume that even liberals don\u2019t want a place to escape politics and instead want politics to invade and conquer the sports world. Time will tell, of course, but it is interesting to see how this argument is morphing from staunch proclamations that ESPN isn\u2019t liberal to the admission that, yes, some hosts are liberal, and finally to the obdurate notion that \u201cyeah, we\u2019re liberal.
