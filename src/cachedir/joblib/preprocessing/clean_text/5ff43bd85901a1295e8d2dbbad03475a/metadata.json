[\u201cI don\u2019t see a body of water wide enough or a wall high enough to keep these problems from our doors,\u201d the Irish rocker said before world leaders Friday at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.  \u201cThe frontier of national interest is no longer the national border,\u201d Bono said. \u201cYou may not be interested in the trouble on a   street or across the Mediterranean on the other side of the globe, but let me assure you, that trouble is interested in you. Our fate is a shared fate. But which fate will it be?\u201d A longtime humanitarian activist, Bono urged world leaders to promote investments in development and education in third world countries like Nigeria. He warned that the Islamic terror group Boko Haram could push the African country into a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d like the one we see in Syria. \u201cWe need to help African leaders make sure that their young people find work, or they\u2019ll find trouble,\u201d Bono said. \u201cFrom where I stand, if Nigeria fails, Africa fails. If Africa fails, Europe fails. And if Europe fails, well, then the world has a very, very big problem. We need to help African leaders make sure that their young people find work, or they\u2019ll find trouble\u201d: Bono was standing in Germany  \u2014   a country currently facing its own humanitarian crisis after opening the doors to an unlimited number of migrants in 2015. To combat the refugee crisis in her country, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has set aside tens of million of taxpayer dollars for a fund that will pay migrants to withdraw their asylum applications and leave Germany voluntarily. Bono acknowledged that a \u201cstrong military\u201d is necessary to secure freedom, but he added, \u201cIn an uncertain world, a strong military is essential, but the best bulwark against violent extremism is hope and opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a plan to make sure all girls can go to school. On hundred thirty million girls around the world don\u2019t,\u201d Bono explained. \u201cFor every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. Some studies even suggest that more education can reduce a country\u2019s risk of conflict by 20 percent. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.'"}, "time": 1742561871.4751256}
