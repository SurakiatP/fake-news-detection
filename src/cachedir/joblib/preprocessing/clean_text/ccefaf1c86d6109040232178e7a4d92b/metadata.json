The Prime Minister has promised to apply an \u2018emergency brake\u2019 on rotund present-givers who have been sneaking across our borders with the aid of a magical flying sleigh and a blithe disregard for passport control. \\nA Home Office spokeswoman said: \u2018We need to beware of Greeks bearing gifts \u2013 or pretty much anyone from Eastern Europe \u2013 smelling of mince pies. We can\u2019t just have quasi-mystical figures coming over here, parking their clapped-out reindeer wherever they want, stealing our low-wage jobs \u2013 jobs which could easily be filled by a British Druid or Boggart \u2013 and blackmailing hard-working British families into plying them with sherry.\u2019 \\nSome children have expressed their disappointment that the festive season will be minus one pivotal figure. Yet Mr Cameron has committed to an in/out referendum, in 2017, over whether stockings will be filled. Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin has suggested Parliament pass a law introducing a cap on beards, rosy cheeks and Polish tooth fairies, while a tweeted offer from former minister Brooks Newmark to \u2018fill your stockings any time you like, sweetie pie\u2019 was hastily withdrawn, as indeed was Mr Newmark himself. \\nOutgoing European Commission head, Jose Manuel Barroso, has warned of the \u2018historic mistake\u2019 the UK would make if it outlawed Father Christmas. \u2018The UK signed up to the laws of the EU, which specifically permit the free movement of labour,\u2019 he said. \u2018Any traffic infringements Santa may commit are a matter for the international air traffic control authorities.\u2019 \\nHowever Nigel Farage countered: \u2018Santa has long be associated with increased crime, elf trafficking and prostitutes \u2013 or \u2018ho ho ho\u2019s\u2019, as he calls them. Arbitrarily deciding who is naughty or nice is just the sort of thing a European bureaucrat would support. And it\u2019s typical of those Eastern Europeans that he only works seasonally, then swans off back to Lappland, wherever that is, leaving us to clear up the mess. We propose to simply keep white Christmas white, you know what I mean\u2019.   30th, 2016 by Wrenfoe   Wrenfoe  '"}, "time": 1742564072.974798}
