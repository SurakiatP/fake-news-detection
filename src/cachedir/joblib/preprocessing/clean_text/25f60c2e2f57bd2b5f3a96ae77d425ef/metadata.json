That\u2019s what an MSNBC reporter found out when he tried to interview a group of three black citizens in line for early voting in South Carolina. \\nThe reporter deliberately tried to bait the black voters into saying something negative about Trump, and was shocked to find out that they were actually supporters of the Republican nominee. \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of criticism of Trump\u2019s inner city policy, but what do you make of that criticism? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard it\u2026\u201d questioned the reporter. \\n\u201cWell, I think that Trump\u2019s reaching out to all citizens, including African-Americans. I think he\u2019s trying to address a problem,\u201d responded one of the women. \\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a problem if you address that there\u2019s something\u2019s wrong and that you\u2019ve got a plan to want to help people. That what a president should do for us, he should reach out and try to help people and address problems that are going on in our country.\u201d \\nNot yet deterred, the reporter tried to bait them again, asking, \u201cSome of the criticism has been because he\u2019ll often say, \u2018What do you have to lose?\u2019 Being specifically African-American, what do you think about that criticism?\u201d \\n\u201cMy word to all black Americans, one thing I would like to say,\u201d answered another woman. \u201cLet\u2019s not be deceived. Look at the record. Look at the promises that have been made over the past from the Democratic Party. We\u2019re not voting for a party, we\u2019re voting for a man who has been standing by\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cHe loves America! That\u2019s what I love about him \u2013 he loves America. We need somebody that loves America. And he also loves all people. All people! And there\u2019s that deception out there that he has no black supporters. WRONG! He does!\u201d \\nWell, all that was just way too much Republican support for MSNBC to handle and the reporter immediately ended the interview. \\nSee it for yourself:'"}, "time": 1742564587.2109861}
