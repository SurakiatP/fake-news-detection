Trump\u2019s business record and economic proposals, seeking to turn his claims of astounding financial success and genius against him and predicting a recession and global panic if he is elected president. In a stern but     speech at an education center garage here, Mrs. Clinton took care to intermingle the policy proclamations of Mr. Trump and his professed image as a business success of the highest order. \u201cDonald Trump has said he\u2019s qualified to be president because of his business record,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cA few days ago he said  \u2014   and I quote  \u2014   \u2018I\u2019m going to do for the country what I did for my business.\u2019 So let\u2019s take a look. \u201d Though she leveled predictable blows against various   products, noting that many items  \u2014   Trump ties, Trump steaks, Trump furniture  \u2014   were made outside the United States, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most pointed refrains sought to depict Mr. Trump, her presumptive Republican opponent, as an enemy to the very people he had claimed to champion in the primary. She checked off the stumbles of his casino business in Atlantic City disparaged his companies\u2019 bankruptcies (Mr. Trump\u2019s many books about business \u201call seem to end at Chapter 11,\u201d she joked) and insisted that his \u201cone move\u201d in business and politics was to make \u201c   promises\u201d and then let people down. Mrs. Clinton invoked her father, who owned a small drapery business in Chicago, as she described Mr. Trump\u2019s history of failing to pay painters, waiters, plumbers and other contractors who had completed work for him. \u201cMy late father was a \u201d she said. \u201cIf his customers had done what Trump did, my dad would never have made it. So I take this personally. \u201d She added, \u201cThis is not normal behavior. \u201d The barrage comes at a perilous moment for Mr. Trump, who fired his campaign manager on Monday and faces severe disadvantages in   and    organization. One supporter introducing Mrs. Clinton said gleefully that the campaign had more staff members in Ohio than Mr. Trump had nationwide. Although polls often show that voters see Mrs. Clinton as more qualified than Mr. Trump on foreign policy, her economic views have not always been an easy sell. In the Democratic primary race, she was dogged by criticism of her support for trade deals struck during the administrations of her husband and President Obama. Mr. Trump, posting repeatedly on Twitter to counter Mrs. Clinton, said he planned to make his own \u201cbig speech\u201d Wednesday to discuss her \u201cfailed policies and bad judgment. \u201d The Trump campaign, which has seldom engaged in rapid response, also sent a barrage of news releases to reporters in an effort to undercut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s arguments. Their subjects included Bill Clinton\u2019s former position on the board of a   college, the loss of manufacturing jobs since 1993 and a slew of negative headlines about economic indicators under President Obama. In one Twitter post, Mr. Trump seemed to embrace a label Mrs. Clinton had tried to make stick: that he had referred to himself as the \u201cking of debt. \u201d \u201cI am \u2018the king of debt,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday. \u201cThat has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U. S. \u201d Mrs. Clinton had taken Mr. Trump to task for suggesting that the United States might default on its debts under his leadership, arguing that Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary, \u201cwould be rolling in his grave. \u201d \u201cThe full faith and credit of the United States is not something you just gamble away,\u201d she said, predicting that because the global economy \u201changs on every word our president says,\u201d even raising the possibility of a default \u201cwould cause a global panic. \u201d At one point, she ridiculed Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that he could \u201csell off America\u2019s assets\u201d if necessary. \u201cEven if we sold all our aircraft carriers and the Statue of Liberty, even if we let some billionaire turn Yosemite into a private country club,\u201d she said, \u201cwe still wouldn\u2019t even get close. \u201d Mrs. Clinton attacked Mr. Trump on several other issues, including immigration and pay equality for women. She also ridiculed Mr. Trump for saying that climate change was a \u201choax invented by the Chinese,\u201d noting that it was \u201ca lot easier to say a problem doesn\u2019t exist than it is to actually try to solve it. \u201d The speech on Tuesday was the centerpiece of a coordinated attack on Mr. Trump\u2019s fiscal sense. On Tuesday morning, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team released a video, \u201cBad Businessman,\u201d featuring clips of figures including Mitt Romney and Senators Marco Rubio and Elizabeth Warren insulting assorted   ventures. \u201cWhat ever happened to Trump Airlines?\u201d Mr. Romney asks in one excerpt, taken from a speech he made in March that struck a similar tone to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s. The campaign introduced a website, Artofthesteal. biz, detailing Mr. Trump\u2019s checkered history in Atlantic City, his father\u2019s role in bolstering his fortunes and his constellation of enterprises. By early evening, Mr. Trump\u2019s team had responded with its own site, LyingCrookedHillary. com, which was not immediately functional but would be in coming days, according to the campaign. In her next scheduled public appearance, on Wednesday in Raleigh, N. C. Mrs. Clinton is expected to shift to a more positive message, outlining her vision for what she has labeled a \u201cgrowth and fairness economy. \u201d Her plans include increasing the minimum wage, closing tax loopholes that encourage companies to move jobs overseas and expanding benefits for working families. Mrs. Clinton has leaned this week on an analysis for Moody\u2019s Analytics led by Mark Zandi, who she noted was an economic adviser to John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. The report predicted that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals on trade, taxation immigration and spending would produce a lengthy downturn and significant job losses, particularly hurting   and   workers. Mrs. Clinton quoted from the report during her speech. But moments before her remarks, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign emailed reporters, noting Mr. Zandi\u2019s ties to Democrats. He has donated to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. As she wrapped up, Mrs. Clinton reiterated a campaign theme  \u2014   \u201cStronger Together\u201d  \u2014   that has become more prominent in recent weeks, and argued that Mr. Trump \u201cbelieves in the worst of us\u201d and cannot be trusted at the controls. Mr. Trump still seemed to be watching. \u201cHillary defrauded America as Secy of State,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cShe used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562193.8614428}
