Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a durable Wisconsin Republican who has served in the House since 1979, had little to offer in response. \u201cIf I could give you an answer today, I would, but I can\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Sensenbrenner said at a    meeting on Saturday, where about 70 people packed a room at the Pewaukee Public Library. Ms. Roelandts\u2019s question and others like it are being asked with increasing anger and urgency across the country, and Republicans have found themselves on the defensive  \u2014   for all their fury aimed at repealing the law, so far they have not agreed on an alternative. Soon after, a man yelled to Mr. Sensenbrenner: \u201cHow many times did you vote to repeal without knowing what the replacement would be? How many times? Dozens!\u201d The congressman, who prides himself on his prolific schedule of    meetings, banged his gavel and insisted that his rules for civility be obeyed. While Mr. Sensenbrenner did not face the kind of anger that some of his peers did in recent days, he must answer the same question: Is this resistance a sign of a sustainable organic movement, or one that will soon flame out? And like his colleagues, he is also coming to grips with how much he will be saddled with the combative comments made by President Trump. Mr. Sensenbrenner, in an interview, attributed the turnout at his gatherings to \u201corganized opposition by people who were on the losing side of the election. \u201d Facing restive audiences in public meetings is not new, but in the age of social media, an ugly scene in one congressional district can quickly attract widespread attention. \u201cI\u2019d be lying to you if I told you it was fun,\u201d he said. In California, Representative Tom McClintock was escorted by police officers after a    meeting earlier this month in Utah, the crowd chanted \u201cDo your job!\u201d at Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight Committee. At a meeting last week, House Republicans were advised on security precautions so they would be prepared for protesters at    meetings or their district offices. The questions from voters on display this weekend at a series of    meetings in Wisconsin\u2019s Fifth Congressional District, many of which were focused on the future of the health care law, underscored the quandary many lawmakers are facing even in solidly Republican districts. The imminent problem: Constituents want answers, and without any consensus on how to go about replacing the law, Republicans have little to say. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like, you know, getting a   jigsaw puzzle for Christmas,\u201d Mr. Sensenbrenner said, \u201cand, you know, cleaning off the dining room table and seeing how long it takes to put all the 30, 000 pieces together in the right place. It\u2019s not going to be easy. \u201d Mr. Sensenbrenner won   last year by 37 percentage points. His   district, which includes suburbs around Milwaukee, voted decisively for Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton. At three    meetings over the weekend, Mr. Sensenbrenner sat at the front of the room to take questions from people who submitted slips of paper listing their name and address. When he called on people, he read their names and where they live  \u2014   a practice that makes people \u201cless likely to make fools of themselves,\u201d he said in the interview. At the meetings, he faced crowds that were adversarial but generally civil, and he fielded questions on a range of issues. At moments when the gatherings grew a bit unruly, he did not hesitate to bang his gavel. Like a frustrated   teacher, he offered some unsolicited advice about comportment. \u201cThis is not a session on who can cheer or boo the loudest,\u201d he said as he began the Pewaukee meeting on Saturday, urging people to \u201cbe respectful of opinions that you do not share. \u201d The tough questioning of Republican lawmakers has been driven partly by concerns over health care, but also by outrage over Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. That was true in Wisconsin, too. Mr. Sensenbrenner, who has long worked on immigration issues in Congress, said the executive order on immigration was \u201ccompletely messed up\u201d and a \u201ctrain wreck. \u201d And he suggested he would be of little assistance in reining in Mr. Trump. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m able to control anybody else\u2019s mouth, from the president on down?\u201d he asked. Repeatedly, the questions Mr. Sensenbrenner faced over the weekend showed the challenge that lawmakers have in explaining the effects of repealing the Affordable Care Act, especially now, when Republicans have yet to coalesce around a replacement plan. Pressed by one questioner to oppose a replacement for the health care law if that replacement would raise costs for sick people, he explained that \u201cthere are winners and losers\u201d when bills are passed. A woman told him she learned she had skin cancer in 2005, and she asked about coverage for people with   conditions. Another woman told him that her    mother was in a nursing home, and she wondered whether changing Medicaid to give each state a fixed amount of money, called a block grant, could cause her mother to be \u201cput out on the street. \u201d Leigh Levas, 35, a medical technologist, told him that her    daughter had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. \u201cI\u2019ve been sending him postcards with her photo, because I think he needs to see the people that it affects,\u201d Ms. Levas said after the Pewaukee meeting. Mr. Sensenbrenner offered a reassurance that some popular aspects of the health care law would remain: insurers would not be able to deny coverage because of   conditions, young adults could stay on their parents\u2019 health plan until they are 26, and lifetime limits on coverage would not be allowed. And he acknowledged the stakes of the repeal effort. \u201cFrom a political standpoint, we Republicans know that we will own whatever the replacement will be, just as Obama and the Democrats own the A. C. A. ,\u201d he told Ms. Roelandts, who asked about health coverage for her daughter. \u201cWe got to get it right, and we got to get it right the first time. \u201d Ms. Roelandts, an accountant, said later that she was not happy with his answer. \u201cI kind of interpret it as they don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re going to do yet,\u201d she said, adding that she was alarmed by the comparison to a   jigsaw puzzle. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about repealing something until you have valid ideas on the table for replacing it,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s causing me to literally lose sleep at night. \u201d Still, Mr. Sensenbrenner was blunt and unapologetic about the Republican push for dismantling President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. \u201cI won by 146, 000 votes,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cI represent the majority. Now, they\u2019re a vocal minority. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564551.3737748}
