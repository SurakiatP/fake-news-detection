Joint exercises codenamed Crna Gora 2016 are taking places until November 4 testing Western allies responses to a number of disaster scenarios, including floods and chemical spills. At the same time, a few miles over the border in Serbia 150 paratroopers from Russian Airborne Troops will be conducting drills from November 2 for two weeks. The exercises will see hundreds of heavily-armed and battle-ready Russian and NATO troops placed within a few hundreds miles of each. Montenegro\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Dusko Markovic said: \u201cThis is an opportunity to work with NATO during the four-day exercise to determine our capacity and the capabilities of our response to natural disasters, as well as to recognise our weaknesses and eliminate them in time. \u201cMontenegro has demonstrated the ability as a future member of NATO, not only through organising this exercise, but also bearing its burden. \u201cMontenegro has demonstrated the ability to not only willing to accept but also help realise partnership goals.\u201d Slavic Brotherhood 2016 will involve Russian troops and Serbian and Belarusian forces. Fifty soldiers from the Russian Military Transport Aviation will take part along with combat vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and drones. Aleksandr Grushko, Russia\u2019s NATO Representative, said of the latest drills: \u201cNATO\u2019s efforts have been changing the very essence of the military security in the regions which are adjacent to the Russian border. \\nRussian troops on exercise \\nAround 680 troops from 32 NATO states and partner countries are taking part \\nMap of Serbia and Montenegro, where the exercises are taking part \u201cThis seriously worsens the regional security and the security of those countries that participate in these drills and this activity. \u201cI think it\u2019s a double signal. First of all, it\u2019s a signal to western public opinion that all NATO actions on its eastern flank are calibrated and do not transcend the framework of reasonable defence. \u201cSecondly, it\u2019s also an apparent attempt to send a signal to us, so that Russia will not react in what they believe to be an excessive and aggressive manner.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564206.960886}
