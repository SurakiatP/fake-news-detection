It has now been revealed, of course, that Clinton hasn\u2019t always expressed the same optimism about the no-fly zone in private. The Intercept (10/10/16 ) reported on Clinton\u2019s recently leaked remarks in a closed-door speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013: To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we\u2019re not putting our pilots at risk\u2014you\u2019re going to kill a lot of Syrians. Other relevant characters, such as US Joint Chiefs of Staff chair Joseph Dunford ( Daily Caller , 9/26/16 ), have warned that a no-fly zone in Syria would simply intensify the conflict\u2014which presumably isn\u2019t the best way to hasten its end. L uckily for those who prefer to rally around illogic, however, plenty of media have already rolled out the welcome mat for peddlers of the \u201chumanitarian\u201d vision of increased Western military interference in Syria. The New York Times \u2018 Nicholas Kristof ( 10/6/16 ) argues against \u201cObama\u2019s paralysis\u201d and for \u201cmore robust strategies advocated by Hillary Clinton.\u201d The New York Times \u2019 self-appointed savior of women , Nicholas Kristof ( 10/6/16 ), invoked the plight of a young Syrian girl in Aleppo to conclude that Obama\u2019s alleged \u201cparalysis\u201d on Syria \u201chas been linked to the loss of perhaps half a million lives\u201d in the country, as well as to \u201cthe rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State,\u201d among other unpleasant outcomes. We have no \u201cexcuse,\u201d we\u2019re told, for \u201cfailing to respond to mass atrocities.\u201d Never mind that the rise of ISIS has much to do with that mass atrocity known as the US invasion of Iraq, thanks to which many young Iraqi girls and other human beings have suffered rape, mutilation and death. It\u2019s convenient for certain industries, at least, when US weapons are deemed the solution for problems US weapons helped to create in the first place. Furthermore, plenty of US weapons continue to flow to countries known for arming and funding ISIS and similar outfits\u2014an arrangement unlikely to be rectified by a no-fly zone targeting the Syrian government and the Russians. USA Today ( 10/8/16 ), meanwhile, ran an opinion piece by an American doctor who worked briefly at a now-destroyed hospital in Aleppo, arguing that the US \u201cshould lead the way in establishing real no-fly zones, either under United Nations auspices or with the British and the French\u201d\u2014because \u201cotherwise, our inaction will continue to be an embarrassment and stand as an example of our spineless irresponsibility.\u201d But considering that there has already been plenty of US action in Syria\u2014including the mistaken \u201cpulverization\u201d of whole families with children\u2014it would seem we\u2019ve already exhibited a fair amount of lethal irresponsibility. Beyond the opinion pages, media figures are pushing the \u201chumanitarian\u201d approach with varying degrees of subtlety. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd ( 10/16/16 ) recently pressed Vice President Joe Biden on the lack of a no-fly zone over Aleppo, suggesting that the Obama administration will \u201clook back and wonder what if? What if? What if? What if?\u201d Of course, no campaign for saving lives with bombs would be complete without everyone\u2019s favorite examples of feel-good destruction from the former Yugoslavia. The Washington Post ( 9/9/16 ) hosted an opinion by Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s first ambassador to the UN, Muhamed Sacirbey, straightforwardly headlined: \u201cWestern Military Intervention Saved Lives in Bosnia. It Can Work in Syria, Too.\u201d Sacirbey warns that \u201cSyria\u2019s largest city is on the brink of starvation. Bombed from the skies and besieged on the ground, Aleppo\u2019s 2 million residents may soon be exterminated.\u201d Gone, apparently, are the days of factchecking, when someone at the Post might have alerted the author to the reality that the vast majority of Aleppo\u2019s residents live in government-controlled areas and are thus not under attack by said government. Comparing Aleppo to besieged Sarajevo, Sacirbey determines that Sarajevans ultimately \u201cescaped many of the horrors now awaiting Aleppo\u2019s residents\u2026 because NATO opted (albeit belatedly and, too often, inadequately) to uphold its responsibility to protect Bosnian civilians.\u201d After lauding Bosnia\u2019s no-fly zone, Sacirbey pulls this prediction out of a hat: \u201cLimited   Syria would save civilian lives, perhaps as many as 200 a week.\u201d In their indispensable essay for Monthly Review ( 10/07 ), \u201cThe Dismantling of Yugoslavia: A Study in In humanitarian Intervention (and a Western Liberal-Left Intellectual and Moral Collapse),\u201d Edward S. Herman and David Peterson make it unavoidably clear that the West\u2019s business in Bosnia   saving lives\u2014and much to do with the contrary. The Bill Clinton administration, they note, actively sabotaged agreements to end the war at an earlier date, while \u201chelping arm the Bosnian Muslims and Croatians and helping bring thousands of Mujahedin to fight in Bosnia.\u201d America\u2019s support in this case for jihadists\u2014a secret alliance also discussed by scholar Tariq Ali ( Guardian , 9/9/06 )\u2014further complicates the assumption that the US is somehow capable of fixing the current jihad problem. In predictable fashion, US media led the charge to the Bosnian intervention ( Extra! , 10-11/92 ), dutifully painting the Serbs as demonic aggressors, parroting inflated Bosnian casualty estimates and otherwise behaving as the official PR arm of the establishment. A similar performance was repeated shortly thereafter with Kosovo, where minimal regard was given to actual facts on the ground and the specter of Serbian-waged genocide was instead hysterically invoked. Noam Chomsky ( Monthly Review , 9/08 ) cited various reports, including from the British government, that the US-backed Kosovo Liberation Army was actually responsible for more killings than the Serbs in the run-up to NATO\u2019s bombing campaign\u2014a project that naturally also managed to kill several thousand people. While Yugoslavia has now been fully dismantled, the myth of Western humanitarian intervention there has emerged unscathed; in his recent dispatch on Syria, Kristof brought up Kosovo as an example of how \u201cthe military toolbox has saved lives.\u201d To be sure, \u201csaving lives\u201d is a much nobler goal than, say, endowing NATO with a new lease on life or clearing the way for total neoliberal assault \u2014two outcomes of the West\u2019s Yugoslav ventures. Hence the utility, as Herman and Peterson write, of the \u201cedifice of lies that serves and protects the Western interventions in the former Yugoslavia\u2014and which laid the ideological foundations for the US role in Iraq and for future so-called humanitarian interventions.\u201d In Syria\u2019s brutal war, meanwhile, humanitarian motives will presumably be utilized as a veneer for pursuing more fundamental goals, like neutralizing resistance to US/Israeli regional designs and promoting that profitable sort of chaos that produces massive arms sales. And just as those in the West who failed to leap onto the bandwagon in Yugoslavia were denounced as \u201c apologists for genocide \u201d and the like, opponents of increased Western military action in Syria will be increasingly assailed as pro-Assad fanatics with Syrian blood on their hands. One strong candidate for fanatic-hood is Greg Shupak, who in a recent Jacobin magazine dispatch ( 10/20/16 ) dared to argue that a no-fly zone \u201cwould actually represent an escalation of war that is guaranteed to harm civilians in the name of protecting them.\u201d Emphasizing that opposition to said zone is not meant in any way \u201cto minimize or rationalize the torture, mass killings or severe sieges enacted by the Syrian state and its allies,\u201d Shupak continues: \u201cThe imminent question, however, is not, \u2018Is the Syrian government good?\u2019; it\u2019s \u2018Should America drop more bombs on Syria?\u2019\u201d Because, at the end of the day, humanitarian war just isn\u2019t humanly possible.
