[The quick spending for the wall would be legally authorized by a   2006 law, which allows the federal government to build 700 miles of   fencing on the border.   \u201cIt was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that\u2019s already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to secure the border,\u201d GOP Rep. Luke Messer told CNN. But the Hill appropriations would break a promise, CNN says:  The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border. In fact, Trump did not claim he would force Mexico to pay the initial costs of the wall, which likely will reduce the huge financial and civic costs imposed by illegal immigration on American communities. Trump\u2019s demand for quick funding from Congress may help the administration overcome   opposition from Democratic and GOP legislators who may try to slow and delay Trump\u2019s border enforcement priorities. So far, senior GOP leaders have promised they will support Trump\u2019s demand for border security, but they have resisted growing public pressure  \u2014   and his campaign promise  \u2014   to reduce legal immigration and companies\u2019 use of  .  \u201cWe want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,\u201d Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the    Republican in the House leadership, told CNN on Thursday.  We\u2019re in talks with him on the details of it as they\u2019re still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there\u2019s another funding bill that\u2019s going to move. We\u2019re going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall. Once the wall\u2019s construction is underway with U. S. funding, Trump will be better positioned to extract some form of payment from Mexico. Illegal immigration costs American taxpayers $113 billion a year, according to a 2010 estimate. The annual legal immigration of   workers also costs Americans many billions in welfare, and reduces salaries and wages.  The   drug trade also imposes huge costs on American communities.
