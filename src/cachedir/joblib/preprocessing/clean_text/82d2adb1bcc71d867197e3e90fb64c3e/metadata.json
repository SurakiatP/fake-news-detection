Rio de Janeiro, like every host city, hopes to continue reaping   benefits long past the closing ceremony, such as increased tourism and a bolstered world reputation. But things don\u2019t always go as planned. In fact, cities rarely make a profit from hosting the Games, and often end up deep in the red. Rio initially planned on the Games costing about $3 billion, but the actual cost will be at least $4. 6 billion, according to a study by the University of Oxford. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to gain money from an Olympics, that\u2019s not a good reason to be doing it,\u201d said David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. For the cities that learned this the hard way, specific venues can end up being reminders of a lack of foresight. The Bird\u2019s Nest in Beijing is a cautionary tale. The   construction cost $480 million to build and an estimated $11 million to maintain annually. But by most accounts, it  does not draw enough visitors to justify the expense, despite the curious existence of a wax museum in its basement featuring former International Olympic Committee presidents. \u201cTourists actually pay money to have their photo taken next to a wax figurine of Sigfrid Edstrom, which is pretty weird,\u201d said Gary Hustwit, who with a fellow photographer, Jon Pack, has visited several Olympic cities for their ongoing Olympic City photo project. While Beijing, which produced the most expensive Summer Games  in history, is often cited as an example of poor   execution, other cities like London, home of the 2012 Games, seem to be faring better. \u201cI think what they did was realistic planning, and with a lot of the cities it\u2019s just, kind of, speculative planning,\u201d Mr. Wallechinsky said of London. He added that four years is not enough time to truly judge a host city\u2019s legacy. Of course, not everything can be anticipated, like a war breaking out eight years after hosting the Games, as was the case for Sarajevo after it held the Winter Games in 1984. But even cities with such dire circumstances can endure and become worthwhile destinations. \u201cSarajevo is a fascinating and beautiful place,\u201d Mr. Pack said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty profound reminder of the consequences of war on a city and its people, and how an Olympic city can carry on. \u201d Whether they are from good planning or unanticipated events, indelible marks of 120 years of modern Olympic competition have been left on many host cities. Here are six that are worth exploring. If Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London looks a bit emptier than it did four years ago, it\u2019s not for a lack of trying. The expansive park near Stratford Station is now home to the largest urban beach in the country, nature trails and boat tours. (Oh, and a long metal tube attached to the    ArcelorMittal Orbit.) The park\u2019s athletic facilities, including the aquatics center, velodrome and Copper Box arena, are open to the public for recreational use, and Olympic Stadium is now the home of West Ham United of the English Premier League. The   venues no longer exist, but, as the name suggests, they were meant to be temporary. \u201cThat to me seems like the real legacy of London 2012, the idea that maybe you don\u2019t need to build dozens of new permanent sports facilities, which was what happened in Athens in 2004, and then struggle to figure out what to do with these things afterward,\u201d Mr. Hustwit said. Another key feature is the ArcelorMittal Orbit, the tallest sculpture in Britain, which is now home to the world\u2019s longest tunnel slide. While its  design was widely criticized  during the Games, its observation deck offers a    view of London. Development of the park will continue into at least the next decade. In the works is the addition of a cultural and education district, home of a new Victoria and Albert Museum \u201cfor the digital age,\u201d a Sadler\u2019s Wells dance theater and educational institutions. Have you been to a nice beach in Barcelona recently? For that, you have the 1992 Summer Games to thank. \u201cBarcelona is a good example of using the Olympics almost as an excuse to improve a city,\u201d Mr. Pack said. The beaches of today used to be an industrial dumping ground, and were redeveloped as part of the preparations for the Games. \u201cThey opened up the beach to the rest of the city, redesigned   areas to make them safer, and built athletic facilities that are still used by the citizens today,\u201d Mr. Pack said. One site that still gets plenty of use is the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Company, whose impressive stone facades remain from the stadium\u2019s original early 20th century design by the architect Pere Dom\u00e8nech i Roura. Originally built for the 1929 International Exposition and remodeled for the 1992 Games, it was recently host to a performance by Beyonc\u00e9, the latest of many concerts and sporting events. Barcelona\u2019s profile soared after the Games. It was the seventh   city in Europe in 2014, according to Euromonitor Research. The Zetra Sports Hall, where the figure skater Scott Hamilton captured the gold for the United States, was repurposed as a morgue during the Bosnian War of the early 1990s. In the 20 years since then, Sarajevo has come a long way but its residents haven\u2019t forgotten the war. \u201cThe people I spoke to there all had profoundly sad stories and memories of the war, often following them up with dark humor,\u201d Mr. Pack said of visiting Sarajevo. \u201cThey then often spoke of the Olympics with a sense of pride. \u201d In some cities like Turin, where he visited in June, he said, \u201cthere is almost no evidence that the Olympics was ever there. \u201d The Dinaric Alps, which held many of the events from the 1984 Winter Games, form a dramatic backdrop to a city with an abundance of ethnic and architectural diversity. The Olympic Stadium, also known as Kosevo Stadium, was renovated after the war and remains active. A notable nearby landmark is the Sarajevo War Theater, created months after the siege began in 1992. Despite the danger, the theater was well attended throughout the war and continues to feature plays, music, poetry and exhibitions. Other facilities are in use as well, but not in ways often associated with former host cities. \u201cMany of these sites probably look like they did right after the war ended,\u201d Mr. Pack said. \u201cBut when I was there, locals were using these venues. There were people picnicking near the bobsled tracks, and biking and skateboarding down the actual concrete segments of track. \u201d This city has long been known for its excellence in design, so it\u2019s no surprise that many of its   structures stand out for their appearance. The Olympic Village was designed by the Finnish architects Martti Valikangas and Hilding Ekelund, and its style can still be appreciated today. \u201cThe Olympic Village in Kapyla are now private condos, while the neighborhood next door,   is a great, early example of the garden city movement in Finland: small, colorful wooden houses and surrounding gardens, designed by Valikangas,\u201d Mr. Pack said. Ekelund also designed the Helsinki Velodrome, which hosted cycling and field hockey events during the Games and was renovated in the late 1990s. It still holds athletic events today and remains a notable architectural site.  The Olympic Stadium and Tower, recently recognized by Architectural Digest in its list of best Olympic architecture, is undergoing a major renovation and is set to reopen in 2019. It\u2019s home to the Sports Museum of Finland as well as many sporting events and concerts. \u201cFor Winter, Lillehammer and Vancouver have been success stories, but probably none more so than Salt Lake City,\u201d said Bill Mallon, a founder of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \u201cThey have really put the venues to good use. \u201d Utah residents always knew they had great snow, but exposure from the Games turned the area into an international skiing destination. Utah resorts drew a record 4. 5 million visitors in 2015, compared with about 3 million in 2002, the year the Games were held. The area can now claim to have the largest ski resort in the United States, Park City, which is about 30 miles east of the city\u2019s center. It resulted from Vail Resorts merging its Park City Mountain Resort with the nearby Canyons resort in 2015. Elsewhere, three of the Games\u2019s top venues, the Utah Olympic Park, the Olympic Ice Oval, and the Soldier Hollow   skiing and biathlon venue, remain in use, serving as training grounds for Olympic hopefuls and providing recreational fun for the public. Getting to skate on the same ice as Olympians is an easy sell for locals and tourists, and braver visitors can ride a bobsled (no matter the season). Other summer activities at the park include extreme tubing,   and adventure courses. The smallest city (technically a village) to host an Olympics actually did it twice, first in 1932 and more famously in 1980, when a scrappy American men\u2019s hockey team upset the heavily favored Soviets. \u201cWinter sports and Lake Placid go together like wildlife and forests,\u201d Robert Flacke, New York State\u2019s commissioner of Environmental Conservation at the time, told The New York Times in January 1981. Whiteface Mountain, one of the highest peaks in the Adirondacks, hosted all of Lake Placid\u2019s Alpine skiing events and is an obvious destination for skiers in the winter and outdoor enthusiasts in the summer. The Olympic Center features the Lake Placid Olympic Museum and is where the \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d occurred. That same rink is open for public use, as is the original skating oval from the 1932 Winter Games. For stunning views of the Adirondacks, options include driving the Whiteface Veteran\u2019s Memorial Highway to the top of Whiteface Mountain or taking an elevator to the top of the Olympic Jumping Complex.'"}, "time": 1742563012.672957}
