Because it\u2019s two pipelines, the owning company Enterprise could shut down one and keep oil flowing, but only 450,000 barrels per day. \\nThe section of pipe that burst can carry 50,000 barrels of oil or roughly 2.75 million gallons. \\nSo right on top of the reported build and right on top of a major break in one of the largest oil pipelines carrying crude AWAY from Cushing, what\u2019s a \u201c\u201dmarket\u201d\u201d manipulating government lackey to do? \\nWhy report a surprise DRAW, thereby spiking oil, and indeed the entire US equity \u201c\u201dmarkets\u201d because, such as. \\nThis all feels about as believable as anything else this (s)election cycle. \\nChris'"}, "time": 1742562137.764651}
