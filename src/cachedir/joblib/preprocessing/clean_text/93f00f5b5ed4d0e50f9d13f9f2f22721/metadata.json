[The consensus among former Clinton aides, former Obama aides, and Democratic strategists is that Clinton\u2019s remarks blaming the Democratic National Committee and others for her election loss are hurting her image and the image of the Democratic Party, the Hill reported.  \u201cShe\u2019s apparently still really, really angry. I mean, we all are. The election was stolen from her, and that\u2019s how she feels,\u201d one longtime Clinton aide said. \u201cBut to go out there publicly again and again and talk about it? And then blame the DNC? It\u2019s not helpful to Democrats. It\u2019s not helpful to the country, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to her,\u201d the aide added. Former DNC Data Director Andrew Therriault was a lot less restrained in his criticism of Clinton, calling her accusations against the DNC \u201cfucking bullshit. \u201d Clinton has also gone    blaming former FBI Director James Comey, the Russians, the press, her primary and general election opponents, and even sexism for her election loss. Some aides and strategists think Clinton needs to step out of the spotlight entirely and let new leaders in the party take up that role. \u201cIf she is trying to come across as the leader of the angry movement of what happened in 2016, then she\u2019s achieving it,\u201d said one former senior aide to Obama. \u201cBut part of the problem she had was she didn\u2019t have a vision for the Democratic Party, and she needs to now take a break and let others come to the forefront. \u201d Despite those in the party calling on Clinton to leave the public eye, her aides and advisers say she will probably remain in the public spotlight to discuss the 2016 election to promote her book that will be released this fall. Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons says that she should talk more about where she went wrong in the election as opposed to blaming others for her elections. \u201cIt would be nice to hear a little more about the things she did wrong, which I believe mattered more than what she has discussed,\u201d Simmons said.'"}, "time": 1742628509.0614662}
