Trump\u2019s supposed activities in Russia, has gone underground. The strange story of the dossier, which United States intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. Senator John McCain and many journalists have had for weeks, if not months, and which Mr. Trump presumably must have known about, appears to have had personal consequences for Mr. Steele. According to neighbors and news reports, Mr. Steele hurriedly left his home in Surrey, a county southwest of London, on Wednesday to avoid attention or possible retribution once his identity as the author of the dossier was revealed, first by The Wall Street Journal. The Journal reported that Mr. Steele had declined its interview requests because the subject was \u201ctoo hot. \u201d Mr. Steele, 52, was a longstanding officer with MI6, the British equivalent of the C. I. A. serving in Paris and Moscow in the 1990s before retiring. In 2009, he started a private research firm, Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. with Christopher Burrows, now 58. Mr. Burrows has refused to confirm or deny that Mr. Steele and Orbis wrote the memos that made up the dossier, initially under contract to a Washington firm paid to dig into harmful matters from Mr. Trump\u2019s past. Mr. Burrows\u2019s profile page on LinkedIn describes him as a former counselor in the Foreign Office, with postings in Brussels and New Delhi in the early 2000s. Diplomatic postings are sometimes used to provide cover for intelligence agents. Mr. Steele\u2019s profile on LinkedIn gives no specifics about his career. He is known in British intelligence circles for his knowledge of the intricate web of   companies and associates that control Russia. Mr. Steele, as a known former MI6 agent, was thought not to have gone to Russia in his investigations but to have used contacts inside and outside the country to prepare the dossier, which United States intelligence agencies have said they cannot substantiate. But the file was used to prepare a   appendix to the intelligence presentation American officials gave to Mr. Trump last Friday. Mr. Trump has denied the allegations in the dossier in the sharpest terms, and called them \u201cfake news. \u201d Russia has denied that it holds any compromising material on Mr. Trump. John Sipher, who retired from the C. I. A. in 2014 after 28 years with the agency, described Mr. Steele as having a good reputation and \u201csome credibility. \u201d Mr. Sipher was stationed in Moscow in the 1990s, and then ran the C. I. A. \u2019s Russia program for three years, according to an interview he gave to PBS NewsHour. He now works at CrossLead, a   technology company. \u201cI have confidence that the F. B. I. is going to follow this through,\u201d Mr. Sipher said. \u201cMy nervousness is that these kind of things are going to dribble and drabble out for the next several years and cause a real problem for this administration going forward. \u201d An investigator for a business research firm in London similar to Orbis, who knows the work of the company but who has met Mr. Steele only briefly, said he was not impressed by the dossier. \u201cI have a lot of experience in this world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I were the client, I would throw it back and say, \u2018Where\u2019s the evidence guys? I can\u2019t use this.\u2019 \u201d The investigator, who asked for anonymity because he did not want to discuss publicly the work of a competitor, said that \u201call intel has to be caveated. \u201d \u201cMaybe they went to a usually reliable source,\u201d he added, \u201cbut there\u2019s no explanation about the credibility of these sources. \u201d He continued, \u201cMaybe sometimes sources want to tell the investigators what their clients want to hear. \u201d Referring to companies like Orbis and his own, he said: \u201cUsually your job would be to stop clients from dealing with corrupt, questionable counterparts in a   country like Russia, but this same network could be put to use\u201d to compile reports like the one on Mr. Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk that maybe the sources fed questionable intelligence, knowing that it would do more damage to Trump\u2019s enemies than to Trump,\u201d the investigator suggested. Orbis\u2019s website says that it was \u201cfounded by former British intelligence professionals. \u201d Based in Grosvenor Gardens, near Victoria Station in London, the company says it has a \u201csophisticated investigative capability\u201d and mounts \u201c  operations\u201d and \u201ccomplex, often   investigations. \u201d According to the website, it also offers \u201c  source reporting on business and politics at all levels,\u201d and \u201cdraws on extensive experience at boardroom level in government, multilateral diplomacy and international business to develop bespoke solutions for clients. \u201d Mr. Steele and Orbis have previously investigated corruption at FIFA, the governing body of world soccer. In October, David Corn of Mother Jones magazine wrote about the dossier and described his conversations with Mr. Steele, whom he did not identify by name or nationality. According to the British newspaper The Telegraph, a friend of Mr. Steele\u2019s said that after his name and nationality were revealed, he had become \u201cterrified for his and his family\u2019s safety. \u201d Mr. Steele\u2019s wife and children also were not at home.'"}, "time": 1742562292.4303885}
