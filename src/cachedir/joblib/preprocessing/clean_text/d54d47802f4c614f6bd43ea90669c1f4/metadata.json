She was accused of illegally harboring a wild animal. The judge said that she knew of only one other pig that had been through the system, Ms. Matteo recalled. The judge named the pig. Ms. Matteo immediately named the pig\u2019s owner. \u201cThe judge was smiling at me,\u201d Ms. Matteo said. The judge asked if there was an underground pig network in New York. \u201cI said, \u2018More than you can imagine. \u2019\u201d An untold number of pet pigs are scattered throughout the city, despite a ban. They can be found in all five boroughs, the veterinarians who treat them say. \u201cThere are so, so many of us,\u201d said a neighbor of Ms. Matteo\u2019s who has two pigs and gave her name only as Leslie W. Ms. Matteo said she knew of dozens. Wilbur, however, a placid   with a fondness for orange peppers and daylong naps, is about to leave their ranks. Though the judge dismissed the violation last May, accepting Ms. Matteo\u2019s explanation that Wilbur was an emotional support animal for her and her father, the city\u2019s health department got the dismissal overturned. Ms. Matteo, 46,  must get rid of Wilbur by the end of the month. She has lined up a sanctuary in North Carolina for him, but she is not ready to give him up. \u201cI\u2019m just praying that something gives between now and Jan. 31,\u201d she said on Monday as Wilbur grunted quietly beside her in her living room on Staten Island\u2019s South Shore. The city\u2019s porcine ranks include a store\u2019s wandering mascot and a spotted pig who frequents Tompkins Square Park in the East Village. Some pigs live as discreetly as it is possible to do in a dense city. Others lead lives like Queelin, a Manhattan resident who is walked in a park near her apartment each day. She has a Facebook account, was the model for a children\u2019s book called \u201cThe New Yorker Porker\u201d and draws attention wherever she goes. \u201cYou basically cannot walk her if you\u2019re in a bad mood or if you\u2019re in a hurry,\u201d said her owner, who gave her name only as Ann, citing the hostile legal climate. Ms. Matteo, who works for a tugboat company, got a piglet on a whim. \u201cI just woke up one morning and said, \u2018I\u2019m buying one,\u2019\u201d she said. That was five years  \u2014   and 165 pounds  \u2014   ago. Wilbur became close friends with Ms. Matteo\u2019s exuberant golden retriever mix, Milo. Wilbur was soon using a doggy door to go out into the yard to relieve himself, root around for leaves and occasionally roll in the mud. The neighbors\u2019 grandchildren fed him carrots, Ms. Matteo said. Then last winter, someone complained to 311. (Ms. Matteo thinks she knows who but declined to offer details.) On March 1  \u2014   National Pig Day  \u2014   a health inspector knocked on the door, and Ms. Matteo\u2019s ailing father, a cancer patient, let him in. A summons followed. The inspector had observed \u201cone large   pig lying on its bed in the living room area of the property. \u201d Ms. Matteo was charged with violating a provision of the city health code prohibiting \u201call   ungulates,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cdeer, antelope, sheep, pigs, including pot bellied pigs, goats, cattle, giraffe and hippopotamus. \u201d In New York\u2019s founding days, pigs roamed the streets, devouring trash and functioning as a   municipal sanitation force. During the early 19th century, the city began passing laws against harboring pigs. Although they eventually disappeared from the streets, they still made cameos. When the Hotel Thorndyke in Midtown caught fire in 1920, The New York Times reported, \u201cMiss Helen Lee Worthing, who is in the Greenwich Village Follies, returned to her room to rescue a pet baby pig used in that production and which she had left sleeping in its basket. \u201d Pigs made a comeback with the potbellied pig craze in the 1980s and \u201990s and have maintained a steady presence ever since. In 2013, as a woman in Queens fought  to keep her pig, Petey, State Senator Tony Avella introduced a bill in the Legislature to legalize pet pigs under 200 pounds statewide. \u201cOver the years, pygmy pigs have gained popularity and recognition as great pets due to the combination of their unique traits such as cleanliness, diminutive size, friendly disposition and intelligence,\u201d the   bill says. It has yet to pass. The health department opposes it, for several reasons. \u201cPigs raised as house pets can become aggressive to humans,\u201d the agency said in a recent statement. Also, it noted, there is no federally approved rabies vaccine for pigs. In 2014, the most recent year for which federal statistics are available, there were no cases of rabies in pigs reported in the United States, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were, however, 272 rabid cats, 59 rabid dogs and one rabid llama. Pig owners scoff at the notion that their pets pose a threat. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous how many people are abusing their animals, how many dogs are mauling people, and they\u2019re worrying about a pig that\u2019s not even bothering anybody,\u201d said Nadine Darsanlal, a disabled veteran who lives in Queens and owns a working therapy pig, also named Wilbur. (The classic children\u2019s book \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d ensures that many pet pigs continue to be named Wilbur.) She keeps him at a friend\u2019s house outside the city, where pigs are legal. At Queelin\u2019s apartment in Manhattan on Tuesday morning, the lawbreaker snoozed on her bed in the corner. Her owner\u2019s older daughter, a college student who asked to be identified only as Margret, eventually persuaded Queelin to get up. In return for treats, Queelin (an Anglicization of her real name, Caoilfhionn, which means \u201cfair and slender\u201d in Irish) sat like a dog and kissed Margret on the lips. Margret lay down on the couch, and Queelin climbed up and plopped on top of her. \u201cShe knows how to trap you because she puts her big head on you,\u201d Margret said as she stroked Queelin\u2019s    bristles. \u201cThen she\u2019s so happy. \u201d Queelin gave a soft snort of agreement.'"}, "time": 1742563363.858273}
