On Wednesday, we traveled with a woman from Massachusetts, the bluest state east of the Mississippi. On Thursday, we joined a man from West Virginia, the reddest state in the East. Dianna Ploss, 53, is a volunteer organizer for Mr. Trump, a turn of fate that surprised even her  \u2014   a longtime Democrat who until recently was uninterested in politics. I am a national correspondent for The Times, originally from Granville, Mass. and I rode with a photographer in the back seat of a Dodge pickup driven by Dianna\u2019s friend Scott Hayes, a landscaper. There was a cardboard cutout of Mr. Trump, too. Along the way, we talked about life, Mr. Trump and the future of America. We stopped at a McDonald\u2019s, Cracker Barrel, Applebee\u2019s and multiple rest areas. We listened to Abba, the Supremes, Fleetwood Mac, Cheryl Lynn and Obama. I got carsick. And   hours later, we made it to Washington. SABRINA TAVERNISE _____ GLOUCESTER, Mass. 10:27 a. m.: I just wrapped up a Facebook Live video introduction to Dianna and Scott, and we\u2019re about to leave for the drive. For her part, Dianna spent the past year working tirelessly for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, spending her own money and countless hours to get him elected. She was even a delegate at the Republican convention. She also lived for years in Cambridge, where Hillary Clinton won 88 percent of the vote. (Mr. Trump got 6 percent.) She has a rare ability to move back and forth between the two worlds. She has a lot to say about both. She had never really been that interested in politics. She grew up in Boston in the 1970s. Her dad worked as a school bus driver. Her mom raised four children and tended bar. \u201cWe were all Democrats back then,\u201d she says. \u201cForty years later, we are all Republicans. \u201d Miles driven: 0. Miles to go: 470. _____ NEAR WORCESTER, Mass. 11:59 a. m.: It has started to snow. The truck\u2019s windows are steaming up. Dianna is talking to people on the phone, trying to help them find a place to stay in Washington. The Airbnb she will be staying in there is filling up fast. Her phone is pinging with people talking to her on Facebook. It\u2019s like a giant extended family all chattering at once. Her journey to this point has been quite a trip of its own. Dianna\u2019s adult life happened suddenly and soon. She got pregnant as a freshman in high school  \u2014   a Catholic school. She was afraid. She says she got through it by putting each part of her life in a different room and closing the door. At graduation, she was the student council president. She thought she should go to college, but now she had a daughter. She had an underachiever boyfriend. She had no money. And her family did not understand what college would get her. It took her 10 years to finish community college. She worked in a bank, painting houses, as a secretary in an   shop. In her   she decided to go to nursing school. She worked in cardiac surgery, in psychiatry, in urgent care. She did well, but she didn\u2019t like it. What she really liked was volunteering. And organizing. She knew nothing about running, but became the director of a private track club, managing 25 coaches and 200 kids ages 8 to 14, and raising the money to support it. When she had the kids sell a coupon book with discounts from local businesses, it was the     the club had ever run. Miles driven: 71. Miles to go: 399. _____ CHARLTON, Mass. 12:26 p. m.: I am carsick. Scott spots a rest area and pulls in. Dianna buys me a Coke and even finds me generic   medicine in a store. \u201cHere you go, honey,\u201d she says kindly. \u201cSit down. You don\u2019t look so good. \u201d I\u2019m drinking a full sugar Coke, and my stomach is already starting to feel better. Miles driven: 83. Miles to go: 387. _____ STURBRIDGE, Mass. 12:47 p. m.: \u201cOh my God! You got to put this one in!\u201d Dianna says, looking through a stack of CDs. \u201cThe Partridge Family?! Are you nuts?\u201d says Scott. \u201cI have Abba,\u201d she says. \u201cNeil Diamond. Chicago. Bee Gees. But I love the Partridge Family. \u201d Scott: \u201cOh boy. \u201d The music begins to play. \u201cI woke up in love this morning. Went to sleep with you on my mind. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated song,\u201d she says, laughing. Miles driven: 92. Miles to go: 378. _____ NEAR HARTFORD, 1:07 p. m.: Dianna reads through some of the comments on the Facebook Live segment: Lots of angry shouting about Trump. Some of it about us. I ask Dianna how she feels. \u201cUncomfortable,\u201d she says. As much as she is part of the Trump team, she tries to avoid alienating people. Maybe that comes from having lived in Cambridge. Maybe that comes from her personality as a networker. \u201cI try to encourage people not to yell,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a little meeting with women who are part of the volunteer team. I said, \u2018If our goal is getting people to go toward Trump, criticizing them isn\u2019t the right way. It makes you look bad, too.\u2019 \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t attack people personally,\u201d she adds. \u201cExcept if I\u2019m by myself and the TV is on. \u201d She pops an Abba album into the truck\u2019s CD player. Miles driven: 126. Miles to go: 344. _____ WETHERSFIELD, Conn. 1:30 p. m.: I ask Dianna how someone who grew up a Democrat in Massachusetts could have wound up a Trump voter. Her move toward politics, she explains, was less a burning ideological expression and more an affinity for people, and for bringing them together. She was good at leading people, but the world was also changing. In 2015, she sold her house in Cambridge and quit nursing to focus on an invention that involves beverages. \u201cI was living in my camper in Framingham in my friend\u2019s yard,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were liberal. Stuff was happening  \u2014   San Bernardino, Paris. I\u2019d think: I don\u2019t know if I agree with them. \u201d When Mr. Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, she felt no sudden spark, she says. But his message steadily seeped in, like a   realization about herself and her beliefs: one she had always had, but had never really considered. \u201cPeople were lying down everywhere,\u201d she says, recalling protests about police violence. \u201cThey were lying down in Harvard Square. They were lying down on Route 93. They blocked traffic for three hours.   is a really congested road you want to pull your hair out anyway. To shut it down? What the hell is going on? What are these people doing?\u201d At some point, she registered as a Republican. \u201cI was trying to find out who I am in this whole crazy mess,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I had to take a stand. It was just crazy. I couldn\u2019t understand it. \u201d Miles driven: 135. Miles to go: 335. _____ BERLIN, Conn. 1:37 p. m.: It has stopped raining. I ask Dianna how she came to like Mr. Trump. She says she did not take his candidacy seriously at first. \u201cAll I knew about him was that reality show,\u201d she says. But when she tuned in, she realized he appealed to her. \u201cI really liked Trump\u2019s   thing. I grew up, I went to Catholic school. We did the Pledge of Allegiance every day. That was important. \u201d \u201cI started to pay attention not to what he was saying, but to the effect that he had. The freedom of speech things. He said outrageous things but so what. People would get so worked up over outrageous things. \u201d \u201cHe was the tough guy. I like that he stood up for himself. He didn\u2019t take any garbage from people. He retaught people how to have their  . He showed that you can stand up for yourself. \u201d Miles driven: 142. Miles to go: 328. _____ NORWALK, Conn. 2:53 p. m.: \u201cOh, they were not happy in there,\u201d Dianna announces, emerging from a McDonald\u2019s with Scott, the Trump cutout and a small bag of French fries. (I had been in the bathroom and missed the action.) \u201cThe guy behind the counter said, \u2018We don\u2019t do politics,\u2019\u201d Dianna reports. \u201cI told him we just needed some fries. \u201d A woman in a puffy blue jacket sitting at the window bangs on the glass with her fist. Having caught our attention, she points her finger at the cardboard Trump and gives a deep   motion. We are standing in the parking lot, and two women walk briskly up to Dianna. \u201cI love Mr. Trump, trust me,\u201d says Lillia Millard, a retired translator who was born in Russia and now lives in West Norwalk. \u201cHe says it like it is, just like me. \u201d Dianna asks if she is going to watch the inauguration. \u201cYes!\u201d she says enthusiastically. Her daughter, a journalist, will not. \u201cShe\u2019s going to the women\u2019s march, unfortunately,\u201d Ms. Millard says, adding, \u201cI still have until Saturday to talk her out of it. \u201d Scott gives her a   bumper sticker, and we pull back out onto the highway to the music of Grand Funk Railroad. Miles driven: 202. Miles to go: 268. _____ DARIEN, Conn. 3:26 p. m.: We are stopping again. The rest stop is all beige plastic and fake wood. A television is playing President Obama\u2019s last news conference. It is barely audible under a thumping Stevie Nicks song. It is in the final minutes. \u201cThere are a lot more good people than bad in this country,\u201d he says. Dianna says back: \u201cYeah. I agree with that. I do. \u201d He says that he curses more behind closed doors. \u201cSo do I,\u201d Dianna says. He is talking about his daughters. He keeps going. He says he believes in this country. Dianna stops agreeing. \u201cDo you believe he believes in this country?\u201d I ask her. \u201cNo,\u201d she replies. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. \u201d I ask her why. \u201cFor all these years, people said all this stuff about him and I didn\u2019t believe them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he has done so much to harm America. He basically tried to be Robin Hood. His trade policies. His willingness to try to take away from people who had more and give to those who had less. \u201d \u201cThe middle class shrunk, more people ended up at the bottom. That was as the result of him. Obamacare was a big part of this. Look how much money it costs me just for my health care. It didn\u2019t make sense to me. It\u2019s hard to know. Is it really what\u2019s in his heart, or are his ideals getting in his way?\u201d Miles driven: 207. Miles to go: 263. _____ Still in DARIEN, Conn. 4:33 p. m.: We\u2019re eating spicy hummus and carrots at the Darien, Conn. rest stop. I am asking Dianna about Mr. Obama. She didn\u2019t vote for him. But she defended him when her family or friends would attack him. Now, she is glad to see him go. Part of that is because of policing. \u201cThe first thing he said that struck me was when he said the Cambridge police acted stupidly,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s remark about the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. a black Harvard professor, in 2009 as Mr. Gates tried to enter his own home. \u201cWhen that comment came out, something in my head went, \u2018Huh? \u2019\u201d \u201cThen he said, \u2018Trayvon Martin could have been my son.\u2019 Maybe that\u2019s what he\u2019s thinking, but when he says something like that as a leader, people listen. I had this like, \u2018What?\u2019 I was confused by that. What are you doing?\u201d She added: \u201cThings have changed in terms of the criminality. People will do anything. They are going up to cops and executing them. People are blowing themselves up. They are ramming trucks into things. If you alienate the police, then we are going to have no law and order. \u201d On Mr. Obama, she said: \u201cWhen you are the leader, there are times when you have to bite your tongue. \u201d She added: \u201cI feel the irony in that, because people will say Donald Trump doesn\u2019t bite his tongue. I want to see how it plays out once he\u2019s president. I don\u2019t know the answer. \u201d Miles driven: 207. Miles to go: 263. _____ FORT LEE, N. J. 6 p. m.: We are back on   closer now to the end of our trip than to the beginning. The Supremes are playing our driver, Scott, is grateful that we are no longer listening to Abba. We have just crossed over the George Washington Bridge. I\u2019m asking Dianna and Scott about immigration. For Scott, economics undergirds his thinking. Two friends used to give him a lot of landscaping work 10 or 15 years ago, but have since stopped they have Latin American employees now. Another client, who recently sold a company for millions, said he wanted to cut Scott\u2019s rate to $20 an hour from $30 and asked him if he could learn Spanish to manage a work crew. \u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m working seven days a week now so I can carry myself through the winter. They say Republicans want the cheaper labor and Democrats want the votes. But I think they both want cheaper labor. People with money just want cheaper labor. \u201d He says he does not blame the laborers, but is angry with politicians who talk as if it were not a problem. \u201cIf I was a poor person south of the border, I\u2019d probably do the same thing,\u201d he says. Scott, 58, who lives in Beverly, Mass. has led rafting trips in Texas on the Rio Grande for years. In 2010, he says, he was at the end of a rafting trip when he saw five people trying to cross the river. They appeared to be asking him to help them across. He kept going. Several months later, Janet Napolitano  \u2014   then the secretary of homeland security  \u2014   was nearby, in Laredo, Tex. and said the border had never been more secure. Scott says he did not believe her. \u201cYou lose your language, border and your culture, you\u2019re going to lose your country,\u201d he says, sounding one of the  \u2019s campaign themes. \u201cYour country is done. \u201d Miles driven: 240. Miles to go: 230. _____ EAST WINDSOR, N. J. 6:57 p. m.: The car is silent. Dianna: \u201cDo you like lobster?\u201d Scott: \u201cI like it, but it\u2019s expensive. \u201d Dianna: \u201cI just don\u2019t like fighting with my food. \u201d Scott: \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s really good is the tail. \u201d Dianna: \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s really good is the butter. Anything tastes good dipped in butter. \u201d Miles driven: 296. Miles to go: 174. _____ MOUNT HOLLY, N. J. 7:38 p. m.  We pulled into a Cracker Barrel for dinner. Dianna had never been inside one. \u201cO. K. there\u2019s country music in the bathroom,\u201d she said. \u201cIt smells nice  \u2014   like candles or something. \u201d She surveys the store. She looks at a wall full of coffee mugs with names on them: Grandpa. Papa. Mom. \u201cLook at all these cups. It\u2019s spewing happiness. It\u2019s like a quaint little town or something. \u201d We left because there was no table with an outlet near it for Dianna or me. Miles driven: 318. Miles to go: 152. _____ WESTAMPTON, N. J. 8:11 p. m.: We are waiting for dinner in an Applebee\u2019s. I ask Dianna and Scott what they expect from Mr. Trump and if they are afraid he might disappoint them. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t deliver on the economy, I\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d Scott says. \u201cHe says he\u2019s going to change the tax rate for the middle class. That\u2019s huge for me. I bought a house five years ago and the taxes have gone up $200 every single year. \u201d Scott doesn\u2019t trusts the elites  \u2014   entrenched politicians with money. \u201cI don\u2019t trust McCain, I don\u2019t trust Rubio, I don\u2019t trust Paul Ryan,\u201d he says. \u201cI love Trump for calling out the elites and the ruling class for who they are. Because they have forgotten about the working man and working woman. \u201d He is also suspicious of the term \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform. \u201d Dianna says: \u201cAnytime a politician uses the word comprehensive, it makes you think they are lying. It\u2019s just an empty word. Smoke and mirrors. They throw big words around, make it look like they are actually doing something. Makes people feel like, almost like they are not smart enough to understand what they are doing. \u201d She added, \u201cI think Trump will deliver. \u201d Our dinner comes. Two shrimp salads and a burger. Miles driven: 319. Miles to go: 151. _____ NEW CASTLE, Del. 9:51 p. m.: We are getting sleepy. Another toll, this one for the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Scott thinks the sign says $400. \u201cWhat! ?\u201d Dianna says in mock shock. \u201cGot to pay for that wall somehow. \u201d Everybody laughs. We pull up to the cash lane. An older woman in a wool hat, glasses and a yellow security vest hands us change. Holding up the Trump cardboard cutout, Dianna asks: \u201cDo you know who this is?\u201d The woman responds in a deadpan voice: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him in my life. \u201d But when she is asked if she likes him, a smile creeps onto her face. \u201cThumbs up,\u201d she says. Miles driven: 366. Miles to go: 104. _____ NEWARK, Del. 10:03 p. m.: It\u2019s dark. Dinner\u2019s over. Disco is playing: Cheryl Lynn\u2019s \u201cGot To Be Real. \u201d Dianna is driving to give Scott a rest. Cardboard Trump is still smirking in the back seat. \u201cI\u2019m getting out my bell bottoms,\u201d says Scott drily. I sing for a while. Dianna does too. Then I ask about health care. \u201cI spent probably $20, 000 on health care last year,\u201d Dianna says. She was paying about $850 a month through a private plan she bought herself. But her deductible for    care jumped to $4, 500 from $3, 000.   she says, jumped to $3, 000 from $2, 000. Dianna, who has been living off the proceeds from the sale of her house in Cambridge, says she could have gotten insured through Obamacare last year, because she was not working. But she chose not to. \u201cI said, Dianna, how can you go on food stamps and get free health care if you are volunteering for Trump? I thought it would be the wrong thing to do. \u201d But now she has Obamacare. She is helping to support her father, she explains, and her budget has gotten tight. \u201cI don\u2019t feel good that I had to do that,\u201d she says. \u201cI have more control over my life when I have better health insurance. It\u2019s also about pride. \u201d Miles driven: 381. Miles to go: 89. _____ BALTIMORE, 10:50 p. m.: Hurtling through Maryland. Fleetwood Mac\u2019s greatest hits playing, \u201cRhiannon\u201d among them. Whatever happens with Mr. Trump, Scott Hayes has already won something important: a deep network of people who think like him. He has a flip phone. He is not on Facebook. But he believes he will hold on to those new connections. They have revived him. Made him feel more alive. \u201cI always felt so alone, like nobody wanted to hear what I was saying,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019d go to these rallies just to see if there were other people who thought like I did. Now I\u2019m meeting all kinds of people. It\u2019s been awesome. \u201d Dianna wants to keep up the momentum with all the people she has met, too. Like the woman named May who owns a Chinese restaurant in Newton, Mass. and who went up to New Hampshire on Tuesdays with some of her staff to volunteer. Dianna organized a Christmas party for Trump supporters in Massachusetts in December. There was Champagne on every table. The cardboard cutout of Trump was there, too. \u201cI\u2019m relieved,\u201d she says. \u201cHe won. I think he\u2019s going to deliver. \u201d Miles driven: 427. Miles to go: 43. _____ WASHINGTON, 11:50 p. m.: We pull into the parking garage at Dianna\u2019s Airbnb in southwest Washington, ride the elevator to the eighth floor, and walk into a spacious   with parquet floors. Scott holds cardboard Trump. There is a view of the Washington Monument. \u201cWow, it\u2019s huge,\u201d Dianna says, looking out a long glass sliding door. \u201cThis is, like, pretty fancy. \u201d Scott stands the   up. I ask the two of them how it feels to be at the end of this    journey. \u201cIt\u2019s the end, but it\u2019s the beginning,\u201d Dianna says. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a new chapter in our lives, for the country, for Mr. Trump. Let\u2019s see what he can do. \u201d Miles driven: 470. Miles to go: 0.'"}, "time": 1742628494.3714283}
