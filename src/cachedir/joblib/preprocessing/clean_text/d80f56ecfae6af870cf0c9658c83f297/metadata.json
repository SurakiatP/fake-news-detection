That, according to a host of experts, both mainstream and alternative, is a given. \\nThe only question now is \u201cwhen\u201d that moment will come. \\nAccording to Christine Hughes, chief investment strategist at Otterwood Capital, it will be very soon. Basing her assessment on historically dead-on yield curve analysis, Hughes says in her latest update to clients that we\u2019re looking at a maximum breaking point of 2020, but that some time in the next 12 \u2013 15 months is the more likely scenario, which pegs the next crisis right at the beginning of 2018 . \\nFirst, the chart, which has been near perfect in its accuracy thus far and shows just how rapidly the yield curve has collapsed in the last 12 months: \\nHughes explains what it means for you and why you can expect 2018 to be the year of reckoning: \\nAs the bond market sees a recession slower growth means lower interest rates and it [the yield curve] collapses. So let\u2019s assume we\u2019re like every other time in history and that happens. Then it moves forward to 2018\u2026 \\nSo, 2018, according to the yield curve, is pretty much the last gasp we have for this economic cycle. We\u2019re closing in on 2016 now\u2026 we basically have a year\u2026 maybe a year to 15 months before we have the next crisis on our hands. \\nSo if you are levered personally or corporately\u2026 if a lot of your assets are in illiquid stuff\u2026 the Canadian housing market comes to mind\u2026 You might want to think about existing and liquefying yourself. \\nWatch the video report: \\nWolf Richter of Wolf Street explains why the Treasury Yield Curve is so important: \\nSince early July, the 30-year US Treasury Bond Price Index has plunged 8.3%. It\u2019s now called \u201cthe rout\u201d in longer-dated government bonds. One of the specters is rising inflation at a time of ultra-low yields. \\nWhat has become the number one predictor of a bear market in stocks over the past many decades? The US Treasury yield curve. It drives bank lending \u2013 which can strangle the economy. But this time, the risks are much higher, and the potential economic consequences steeper. \\nWe know it is only a matter of time at this point. \\nGreg Mannarino of Traders Choice has made similar warnings, noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead. And when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts, according to Mannarino, could lead to extremely serious consequences: \\nSo, when the debt bubble bursts we\u2019re going to get a correction in population. It\u2019s a mathematical certainty. \\nMillions upon millions of people are going to die on a world-wide scale when the debt bubble bursts. And I\u2019m saying when not if\u2026 \\n\u2026 \\nWhen resources become more and more scarce we\u2019re going to see countries at war with each other. People will be scrambling\u2026 in a worst case scenario\u2026 doing everything that they can to survive\u2026 to provide for their family and for themselves. \\nThere\u2019s no way out of it. \\nSource: Analyst: \u201cMillions Upon Millions of People Are Going to Die on a World-Wide Scale When the Debt Bubble Bursts\u201d \\nIf Mannarino and Hughes are right, you have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapse . \\nBuy 2017 Gold Pandas and Buy 2017 Silver Panda Coins On Pre-Sale Now!
