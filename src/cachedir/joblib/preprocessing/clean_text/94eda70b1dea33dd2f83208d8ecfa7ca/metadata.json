The publication of \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d the eighth installment in J. K. Rowling\u2019s   series, is being celebrated at more than 5, 000 bookstores and libraries across the country this weekend, with midnight release parties featuring costume contests, magic shows, wizard rock bands, live owls and butterbeer, the beverage of choice among young wizards. The elaborate rollout has all the flourishes that fans have come to expect for a new Harry Potter book. But for many nostalgic readers, this one feels different. \u201cCursed Child\u201d is not a new novel, but a script of a play  \u2014   a format that typically isn\u2019t read for pleasure and almost never produces overnight best sellers. And unlike the previous seven books in the series, it was not written by Ms. Rowling herself. In a sense, \u201cCursed Child\u201d is more like sanctioned fan fiction than a new work by a beloved writer. Ms. Rowling worked on the play\u2019s plot with the playwright Jack Thorne and the director John Tiffany, and while she helped shape the story, she has made it abundantly clear that she did not write the script. The idea for the play, which explores Harry\u2019s life as an adult and parent, didn\u2019t originate with Ms. Rowling, either: She merely agreed to it when two theater producers proposed the concept. Which raises a sticky question: If Ms. Rowling didn\u2019t conceive the play, or write it, is \u201cCursed Child\u201d really a new Harry Potter story by J. K. Rowling? And if it isn\u2019t, do Harry Potter fans even care? Many, apparently, do not. \u201cJ. K. Rowling\u2019s involvement legitimizes it as canon, and the fact that other people collaborated on it doesn\u2019t detract from that,\u201d said Matt Maggiacomo, executive director of the Harry Potter Alliance, a nonprofit group that promotes literacy and other causes. Melissa Anelli, the author of \u201cHarry, a History,\u201d a book about the Harry Potter phenomenon, agreed that any story with Ms. Rowling\u2019s blessing counts as a continuation of the tale  \u2014   a view that many Potter fans seem to share, based on the vast number of preorders and the ecstatic response on social media to news that the play would be published. \u201cThe thing that we all always want most from her is a book, but if we\u2019re getting the story in the form of a play, as long as she says it\u2019s the real deal, we\u2019re on board,\u201d said Ms. Anelli, who is organizing a midnight release party for some 2, 000 fans at Geeky Con, a festival in Orlando, Fla. that will feature a costume ball and performances by wizard rock bands. But other Potter fans are skeptical, arguing that a story that didn\u2019t spring from Ms. Rowling\u2019s imagination just isn\u2019t the same. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of people who aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re going to treat it as canon, because J. K. Rowling didn\u2019t write it,\u201d said Helen Haslam, who publishes Potter fan fiction at the website Wattpad. \u201cI grew up with the books, I spent a lot of time in that world, and the idea of someone else adding to that is a little bit  . \u201d Some will skip it altogether. Sharanya Sharma, an elementary school teacher in Washington who fell under Harry Potter\u2019s spell when she was 9, said she was satisfied when the series ended with \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. \u201d \u201cI worry that it would negatively affect my memories of what Harry Potter meant to me when I was growing up,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I go back and reread Harry Potter as a nostalgic experience, and I\u2019m not sure I want to ruin that. \u201d Though it\u2019s been nearly a decade since Ms. Rowling ended her beloved series, devotion among   fans has never waned. While Ms. Rowling has moved on to writing adult fiction, she has continued to embellish the Potter universe, not just with material on her Pottermore website but also through public pronouncements about the characters. The fans\u2019 fervor has been steadily fed by a stream of blockbuster movies, theme parks, new short stories about the wizarding world released on Pottermore, and now, \u201cCursed Child,\u201d which picks up with a scene from the epilogue in \u201cDeathly Hallows,\u201d as a   Harry watches his own sons depart for Hogwarts. The play, which officially opens on Saturday in London, has already generated ecstatic praise from theater critics. It\u2019s hard to imagine enthusiasm running as high for the unvarnished script, which could fall flat on the page without the elaborate staging and the emotional nuances of a performance. \u201cI think there will be a lot of disappointment,\u201d said John Granger, who has published several books of literary criticism about Harry Potter and dismissed the play as \u201cfranchise exploitation. \u201d Still, \u201cCursed Child\u201d  \u2014   which is being released at midnight on Saturday (just in time for Harry\u2019s birthday Sunday)  \u2014   is on track to be a blockbuster. Scholastic, Ms. Rowling\u2019s American publisher, is printing 4. 5 million copies  \u2014   a staggeringly large number, though it scarcely approaches the    run for \u201cDeathly Hallows. \u201d Barnes  Noble reported that \u201cCursed Child\u201d is the most heavily preordered book since \u201cDeathly Hallows. \u201d On Amazon, \u201cCursed Child\u201d has held steady at, or near, the top of the   list since publication was announced in February, making it the site\u2019s   book so far this year. Some booksellers and librarians say that the story\u2019s format could introduce young readers to the pleasures of reading drama for entertainment. While most high school students are exposed to classics by Shakespeare, Sophocles and Arthur Miller, children and teenagers rarely pick up plays for fun. \u201cThey\u2019re going to discover how much their own imagination can add,\u201d said Peter Glassman, the founder and owner of Books of Wonder in Manhattan, which will have live owls, jugglers and magicians at its midnight release party. Scholastic is hoping that readers will embrace the book, regardless of the form. \u201cPlay format, novel format, it\u2019s still a story,\u201d said Arthur A. Levine, the vice president and publisher of Arthur A. Levine Books, a Scholastic imprint that publishes Harry Potter. As the series, which has sold more than 450 million copies globally, has become an undisputed modern classic, Scholastic has capitalized by releasing new editions with revamped covers and illustrations. \u201cThey sell year after year after year, when a new generation discovers Harry Potter,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cWe try to keep giving them something new. \u201d This year, fans will get plenty. In November, Scholastic is publishing the screenplay for \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\u201d a coming movie that expands the Harry Potter universe to North America. Readers are already swooning, driving the screenplay to No. 34 on Friday on Amazon\u2019s   list. Unlike \u201cCursed Child,\u201d this script was written by Ms. Rowling herself.'"}, "time": 1742628493.2151408}
