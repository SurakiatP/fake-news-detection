Bannon for the role he played in securing victory for the Leave campaign in the European Union (EU) referendum. [In an interview with Breitbart London Editor in Chief Raheem Kassam on Breitbart News Daily, to mark the occasion of Britain finally triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and officially commencing the Brexit process, the former UKIP chief was bursting with enthusiasm:  \u201cGood morning everybody! It\u2019s a happy day here in London!\u201d he began. \u201cAll through the campaign, I went round the country with a placard that said, \u2018We want out country back\u2019  \u2014   and I\u2019m just getting a marker pen, and I\u2019m going to cross out the \u2018want\u2019 and put \u2018got\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big day, and I think at 12:30, when that letter is delivered in Brussels we will have passed the point of no return. We are going to become an independent,   normal democratic nation again. \u201d Kassam asked the veteran campaigner if he had ever worried that \u201clegacy Remainers\u201d such as former prime minister Tony Blair and millionaire financier Gina Miller, might succeed in preventing this day from coming to pass. \u201cWell, it shouldn\u2019t have taken nine months,\u201d Farage replied. \u201cTalk about a long gestation!\u201d He did not believe, however, that there was any realistic way out for the political class after more than 17 million British voters backed Brexit, and suggested the delay may have been due to the fact that \u201cthe establishment did not want us to vote to leave [and] did not expect us to vote to leave\u201d and made no contingency plans for it. Asked if he thought diehard Remainers might now turn their efforts towards making a success of Brexit, Farage was sceptical. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever give up they\u2019ve been so used to having their own way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they will begin to look more and more ridiculous. \u201d Farage confessed that family, friends, and colleagues \u201call thought I\u2019d been smoking something funny\u201d when he first set out in politics, and that actually achieving Brexit \u201clooked completely and utterly impossible in every way\u201d. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a   journey. At first, dozens of people were there helping and supporting me. Then it was hundreds, then it was thousands, then it was millions  \u2014   and today, the impossible dream came true. \u201d Farage attributed Brexit to failures within the EU itself, including the euro \u201cwhich nearly all the Remoaners would have signed the country up to 15 years ago\u201d. He took the opportunity to pay tribute to Breitbart News Network in general and former Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, now a leading figure within President Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration, in particular, for giving eurosceptic voices shut out by the establishment media a platform where they could speak to the public: \u201cOne of the very important things that happened is, because we had the entire media against us, and not even willing to give us a fair hearing, I think when Bannon opened up the Breitbart office in London and began to give the arguments that I was making a fair hearing, and very quickly, as Breitbart does well, started to reach a very, very big audience. I think actually on this great Brexit day I have to say a personal thank you and tribute to Steve Bannon for having the foresightedness of doing that with Breitbart, and I\u2019m extremely grateful. \u201d '"}, "time": 1742628481.9094439}
