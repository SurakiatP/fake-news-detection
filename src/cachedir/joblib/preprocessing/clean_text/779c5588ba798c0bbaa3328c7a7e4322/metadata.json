[Three of the four officers were white King, who died in 2012, was black. (Two officers were later convicted in a federal civil rights trial.)  As Bay Area public radio station KQED recalls: Fury over the acquittal  \u2014   stoked by years of racial and economic inequality in the city  \u2014   spilled over into the streets, resulting in five days of rioting in Los Angeles. It ignited a national conversation about racial and economic disparity and police use of force that continues today.   \u2026     The acquittals were announced around 3 p. m. less than three hours later, the unrest began. Residents set fires, looted and destroyed liquor stores, grocery stores, retail shops and fast food restaurants.   motorists  \u2014   both white and Latino  \u2014   were targeted some were pulled out of their cars and beaten. The reaction to the acquittal in South Central Los Angeles  \u2014   now known just as South Los Angeles  \u2014   was particularly violent. At the time, more than half of the population there was black. Tension had already been mounting in the neighborhood in the years leading up to the riots: the unemployment rate was about 50 percent, a drug epidemic was ravaging the area, and gang activity and violent crime were high. During the riots, a white trucker, Reginald Denny, was nearly beaten to death by gang members, and footage of the beating was captured overhead. Four black bystanders intervened and saved Denny by driving him to the hospital. In the years since then, there has been significant improvement in the relationship between the LAPD and minority communities in the city. For that reason, the marches of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 caught many observers by surprise. During the riots, King pleaded for calm: \u201cI just want to say  \u2014   you know  \u2014   can we all get along?\u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
