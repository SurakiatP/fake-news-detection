{"duration": 0.17404389381408691, "input_args": {"text": "'Megyn Kelly  \u2014   breakout star of the 2016 presidential campaign, anchor of the \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d on Fox News, current object of employment desire for multiple networks,   author, mother, wife, daughter and friend (the last four being how she describes herself)  \u2014   has something she wants everyone to know. Really. A lot. Listen up. Not just that it is dangerous when   Donald J. Trump calls out a single citizen on social media, seemingly giving permission to his followers to turn into rabid attack dogs, although she knows firsthand what that is like, having been the original target of his wrath for almost a year, starting in August 2015. Not just that hard work and an unsparing sense of your own strengths and weaknesses (and those of other people) can put you in a good place, though she writes about that a lot in her book, which is called, naturally, \u201cSettle for More,\u201d a catchphrase she also drops strategically into conversation. But also (and this may seem   but it is not) that she in no way apologizes for wearing that   dress to the Republican National Convention in July. You know, the one that sent the internet into what she called a \u201cmeltdown\u201d because it revealed a whole lot of   \u2026     shoulder! And thus, was unlike any dress that had been seen on a serious anchor ever, except maybe at the White House Correspondents Dinner. Definitely never behind a desk. \u201cIt was a lovely dress,\u201d she said  \u2014   this in a car during a brief respite back home in New York between book tour stops. \u201cA convention is a kind of   extravaganza, and there are certain settings where you can take risks. So I just thought: \u2018Yes, I can do this. I can be smart and challenging while I wear spaghetti straps, and everyone is just going to have to get their heads around that. \u2019\u201d Just to prove it, she has worn it again. Because, she said, \u201cI felt very strongly, I was not going to be defined by what someone else deemed appropriate. \u201d Indeed, for the past few years, ever since Ms. Kelly, 46, began making a name for herself as the person willing to call out power players on their own contradictions, contortions (verbal and  ) and   she has become famous for refusing to be boxed in by anyone else\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d: not her network\u2019s, nor a political party\u2019s, nor the mythical dos and don\u2019ts of career girl dress. She took on Newt Gingrich over his \u201canger issues\u201d in October, sparred with the Republican Svengali Karl Rove over his electoral math in 2012 and challenged the conservative radio host Mike Gallagher over his dismissal of maternity leave. These moments have become widely known as \u201cMegyn Moments,\u201d so named by Jim Rutenberg, media columnist for The New York Times, in a profile last year. But what has been less widely acknowledged is that they extend far beyond her reports and interviews at the anchor desk into a broader statement about how women should be able to frame their gender. Put simply, she doesn\u2019t just say what she wants. She wears what she wants. \u201cYou cannot underestimate the effect of that,\u201d said Tammy Haddad, chief executive of Haddad Media and a former MSNBC political director. \u201cHer personal image and her business image are one and the same. The intensity she brings to her work, she brings to her look, and she doesn\u2019t allow it to get in her way. That\u2019s good for all women. And it is completely different from what came before. \u201d For years, industry wisdom suggested that a female anchor, like many female executives, should dress like her male colleagues: in a suit, with a dark jacket and blouse. See, for example, Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer. In 1996, when MSNBC began, Katie Couric donned a beige jacket and black turtleneck for the debut broadcast by 2006, when she became the first woman to solo anchor the \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d she had loosened up enough to wear a white jacket and black  . This has, admittedly, changed, with the brightly colored and sometime patterned sleeveless sheath dress currently a favorite of newswomen such as Mika Brzezinski of \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and Gayle King,   of \u201cCBS This Morning. \u201d However, the fact that Ms. Kelly is on at 9 p. m. rather than during breakfast puts her choices in a different category, Ms. Haddad said: \u201cShe is talking to the   audience, the critical audience. \u201d And what she is telling them, Ms. Kelly said, is \u201cthat, within reason, they can make their own choices about how they look and how they act. \u201d \u201cI do think there is a new archetype for women emerging that rejects the bounds that have been placed on them,\u201d she added. A 1992 profile of Ms. Sawyer in Vanity Fair, for example, subtitled, \u201cHow she finally beat the glamour rap. \u201d Ms. Kelly, who appeared on the magazine\u2019s cover last February, only the second female newscaster to do so, has no problem with the glamour rap. In part because she doesn\u2019t ignore it. Describing the haircut she got before the second Republican debate, for example, when she was deep in her Trump war and decided to lop her   waves into a   crop, Ms. Kelly quite cheerfully took a   invitation and turned it into a taunt  \u2014   thus owning the vulgarity and weaponizing what might otherwise have seemed a mere beauty decision. In her book she writes that when she went to meet Mr. Trump for the first time since their public tussle to discuss having him do an interview with her, she wore her favorite black sheath Gucci dress. \u201cI feel strong in it,\u201d she said. By acknowledging the role clothes play in her own life and psyche, she is contravening one of the last taboos: If women want to be taken seriously, they are not supposed to take fashion seriously. A patently idiotic idea. (If you want to be taken seriously, you had better think seriously about every message you are sending, including the ones in your outfits.) In this she is part of a handful of women in the public eye who are breaking that rule, including Michelle \u201cno sleeves\u201d Obama and Sheryl \u201cno hoodies\u201d Sandberg. \u201cWe talk about it a lot: What is the world we are trying to create for our daughters  \u2014   she has one, I have two  \u2014   and how we can move things forward?\u201d said Debra Netschert, a managing director of Jennison Associates, an asset management firm, who has been friends with Ms. Kelly for about four years. It is not a coincidence that in 2010, when Ms. Kelly moved from the morning show \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d to become   of the afternoon show \u201cAmerica Live,\u201d she hired her own stylist. Generally, the Fox anchors use the Fox stylist, just as they use the Fox hair and makeup people, which is why there is what is generally known as a \u201cFox Look\u201d: for women, clingy brightly colored   dresses that \u201cpop\u201d on TV, tousled hair and a lot of eye makeup, lip gloss and base. But, she said, that means \u201cwe all sort of look the same. \u201d When she started in TV after a   career as a lawyer, she wore mostly navy, black and gray suits, and pinstripes  \u2014   a \u201clot of Ann Taylor and Theory\u201d  \u2014   but then Fox put her in its wardrobe, \u201cwhich was weird, because I had never really worn color before,\u201d she said. So when she got her own show, she said she decided \u201cI wanted to define myself differently. \u201d Which is to say, \u201cas myself,\u201d rather than as the network\u2019s product. She enlisted the help of her neighbor, Dana Perriello, whom she knew first as a mom, but who had a sideline as a personal stylist. Because they were friends before they worked together, \u201cShe knew who I was,\u201d Ms. Kelly said, and Ms. Perriello had an idea about how Ms. Kelly could express herself. They began to define a \u201cMegyn look,\u201d which had to do with clothes that were \u201cstrong, stylish, sleek, tailored, feminine, but not frilly,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cI don\u2019t like frills. \u201d \u201cShe wanted to be fashionable not just in the news world, but in any world,\u201d said Ms. Perriello, who puts outfits together for Ms. Kelly  \u2014   dress, shoes, jewelry  \u2014   and sends her look books of everything  . Now Ms. Kelly wears mostly dresses by Victoria Beckham, Stella McCartney, Roland Mouret and Narciso Rodriguez, though Ms. Perriello is increasingly adding separates (and sleeves). The   dress was by Ralph Lauren. In the photograph for this article, Ms. Kelly wore a black Fendi stretch jersey dress and silver Jimmy Choo   stilettos. Her color palette is once again dominated by black and white, with the occasional red and blue thrown in. She likes a cutout and a high spiked heel. She also likes leather and, Ms. Perriello said, \u201chardware. \u201d She has recently been wearing a lot of asymmetrical cuts, \u201cwhich is not very common in news,\u201d Ms. Perriello said. What she does not wear is florals or anything too lacy. Also, \u201cYou will never catch me in a dress without a pair of Spanx and a bra,\u201d Ms. Kelly said, and she is happy to explain why. In fact, she thinks it is good to explain why: \u201cAfter three children, it all came back together, but it didn\u2019t come back together the way it used to be. \u201d Though earlier this year she said that she, along with many of her female colleagues, was sexually harassed by the former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, and though she writes about it in her book, all of that happened during her \u201cfrumpy   suit period,\u201d not during her later, more   period. A fact she pointed out to underscore that such harassment was really about power and not  . No woman is \u201casking for it\u201d because of what she wears, and no woman should be judged for it, though judging  \u2014   in a dismissive and derogatory way  \u2014   is exactly what Ms. Kelly experienced earlier this year when Mr. Trump and assorted others resurfaced a 2010 GQ shoot of Ms. Kelly in a black slip and stilettos, draped over a chair. In January, @gene70 tweeted the photo with the message, \u201cAnd this is the bimbo that\u2019s asking presidential questions?\u201d Mr. Trump retweeted it. Ms. Kelly was having none of it. \u201cThey tried to   me!\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think I looked great. I had just turned 40, and I was pregnant. Some people at Fox still think it was a mistake, but I refuse to have to dismiss these options because of other people\u2019s prejudices, and my willingness to engage just proves they are wrong. \u201d In other words, it was appropriate because Megyn Kelly said it was appropriate. Rhetorically, this is not unlike the argument Gloria Steinem used when someone told her at her 40th birthday that she didn\u2019t look 40. Ms. Steinem responded: \u201cThis is what 40 looks like. \u201d Ms. Kelly, however, may not like the comparison. She has regularly refused to categorize herself as a feminist, because she thinks it is nichifying. She also rejects descriptions such as \u201cpioneer\u201d and \u201ctrailblazer,\u201d and says, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get drunk on your own wine,\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be authentic. \u201d The irony is, insisting on her femininity while also insisting on her due  \u2014   that she can have her career and her family, too, and in your face with a spaghetti strap if you don\u2019t like that  \u2014   may be the most authentically feminist act of all.'"}, "time": 1742564039.8228557}
