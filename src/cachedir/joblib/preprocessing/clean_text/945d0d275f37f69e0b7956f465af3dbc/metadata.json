Likely to get questions on State Department emails. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails,\u201d Kadzik wrote.\\nPeter Kadzik is also in charge of investigating Huma Abedin\u2019s emails. Kadzik was also an attorney for John Podesta and in Podesta\u2019s own words he was a \u201c fantastic lawyer\u201d who \u201ckept me out of jail.\u201d \\nIn another bombshell, Podesta made false statements to a grand jury during the investigation into the Monica Lewinsky trial, which Podesta himself summarizes in another leaked email. \\nA further revelations about Kadzik is the fact that Peter Kadzik represented Marc Rich as his attorney \u2013 the same Marc Rich that Bill Clinton controversially pardoned and the FBI released it\u2019s investigation files into on Monday.\\nIf that\u2019s not enough Kadzik\u2019s son tried to get a job working for the Clinton campaign . Then there is the fact that Kadzik had multiple dinners with Podesta during the email investigation .\\nThese are obvious conflicts of interest here and one that needs to be brought forward.\\nIn another example of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the government\u2019s investigation of it\u2019s candidate Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s been revealed that FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe\u2019s wife received $675,000 in political donations from Clinton campaign surrogate Terry McAuliffe\u2019s PAC and the Democratic Party of Virginia.\\n\\nTerry McAuliffe was the person that enabled the FBI to open an investigation into the Clinton Foundation when Terry McAuliffe himself was investigated for corruption .\\nOther Wikileaks emails show collusion between officials in the U.S. State Department. Two recently leaked emails show that not only was Clinton\u2019s campaign tipped off by a DOJ insider but the U.S. State Department colluded with the New York Times the day prior to announcing Hillary\u2019s private server.\\nLauren Hickey told Clinton aides that then-State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki \u201cjust cleared\u201d a statement to a New York Times reporter. \\n\u201cHi guys \u2013 Jen just cleared. She made the highlighted change \u2014 just rephrased a line about NARA updates state is undertaking. Yes on your point re records \u2013 done below. And yes will let you know \u2014 should be in the new few minutes.\u201d \u2013 Lauren Hickey.\\nAdditionally an email from Brian Fallon, Clinton\u2019s press secretary who used to be the DOJ\u2019s director of public affairs until joining Clinton\u2019s campaign in April 2015, highlights that Fallon was being leaked information from the DOJ on Hillary Clinton\u2019s investigation in the early stages of a status hearing. So what makes you think he didn\u2019t get further information? To add to that, again a private non-government email was used to relay this information to Podesta and the rest of the campaign.\\n\\n\u201cDOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge\u2019s thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today.\u201d\\n\u2013 Brian Fallon.\\n\\nWhat more will be revealed about the inner workings of Clinton\u2019s campaign and the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server?
