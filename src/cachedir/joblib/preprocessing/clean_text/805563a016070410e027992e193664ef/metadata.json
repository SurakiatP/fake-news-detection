Trump, won the presidential election. But her mood of celebration quickly faded when students held an evening vigil on campus  \u2014   to mourn the results  \u2014   and her biology teacher suspended class on the assumption, Ms. Delekta said, that students would be too upset to focus. She was outraged. \u201cNobody has died,\u201d Ms. Delekta said. \u201cThe United States has not died. Democracy is more alive than ever. Simply put, the American people voted and Trump won. \u201d She circulated an online petition and accused the university president of catering to the liberal majority by suggesting that \u201ctheir ideology was superior to the ideology of their peers,\u201d as she put it, when he sent out an email publicizing the vigil and listing counseling resources for students upset by the election. Three days later, she was invited to meet with the president in his office. \u201cI was completely shocked that he even read the letter,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was definitely a new thing. It was very exciting. \u201d Conservatives and liberals on campuses across the country have been clashing throughout the campaign  \u2014   and throughout this year of protest. But the conflict has gained new intensity since the election, and students, faculty and administrators say they expect tension to get worse once the presidential baton is passed on Inauguration Day in January. Conservative students who voted for Mr. Trump say that even though their candidate won, their views are not respected. Some are adopting the language of the left, saying they need a \u201csafe space\u201d to express their opinions  \u2014   a twist resented by   protesters. Administrators are struggling to maintain a balance between political factions. But some college presidents have entered the fray with statements that seem more sympathetic to the left, in some cases provoking a backlash. To Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University, and a veteran of student protests in the 1960s, it all seems familiar  \u2014   and a possible harbinger of conflict to come. Dr. Gitlin said that the \u201960s, about which he wrote an influential book, were often seen as a radical decade, but that it was more accurate to call it a polarized time. Conservatives were strong on campus, particularly in the early part of the decade, he said, and it was only later that the academic culture came to be viewed as majority liberal. \u201cI was at Michigan for two years in \u201963 to \u201965, so I can tell you there was a very widespread   movement,\u201d Dr. Gitlin said. For conservative students like Ms. Deletka, the messages from university officials, seemingly assuming that everyone on campus was upset about the election result, were particularly offensive. At Columbia, the provost, John H. Coatsworth, sent out an email on Nov. 21 that began, \u201cThe presidential election has prompted intense concern for the values we hold dear and for members of our community who are apprehensive about what the future holds. \u201d The day after the election, Biddy Martin, president of Amherst College in Massachusetts, called for tolerance and acknowledged that some people might be rejoicing. But she also said in a speech on campus: \u201cIn the mirror we see virulent forms of racism, misogyny, homophobia and other ills and we see them celebrated by some as though the expression of our worst impulses were the definition of human freedom. \u201d Amherst also saw a bit of a controversy surrounding a professor who was singled out for his views. The professor, Hadley Arkes, an emeritus professor of political science, pulled out a bottle of champagne in his political science class to celebrate Mr. Trump\u2019s election. An editorial in The Amherst Student newspaper criticized him for bringing alcohol to class, and suggested that college officials hold him \u201caccountable\u201d for supporting a candidate the paper\u2019s editorial board thought was bigoted, homophobic and misogynist. \u201cThere are students on this campus whose lives and civil liberties will be compromised in the next four years,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cNot only does Amherst\u2019s nonpartisan stance invalidate their struggles, but brash and insensitive political partisanship creates irreparable scars. \u201d Dr. Arkes said that he had offered students in his class a spectrum of ways to express their feelings postelection. For students who were grieving, he recited the Kaddish, the Jewish mourner\u2019s prayer. For those who were celebrating, he quoted Churchill about not gloating: \u201cIn victory, magnanimity. \u201d Finally, in what he said was intended as a comic gesture, he pulled out the champagne. But mindful that he might be accused of offering an alcoholic beverage to underage students, he did not uncork it. Now it seemed, he said, that some people just could not take a joke. \u201cThere is no urbanity or humor  \u2014   or the wit to deal with challenge, grave or light,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThey can respond only in \u2018boilerplate,\u2019 quite predictable reflexes  \u2014   so predictable that I did predict it easily. \u201d The mood is muted at more conservative campuses, students and professors said. Erika Meitner, a creative writing professor at Virginia Tech, said that there was a strange quietness on her campus, and that she was not sure whether to think of it as d\u00e9tente or the calm before the storm. Ms. Meitner said that as a leader of small poetry seminars, she knew a lot about her students\u2019 private lives. So she has been struck by how they have kept their reactions to the election to themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird, because I know all of their breakups,\u201d she said. \u201cI know when their cat died, because they write poems about this. \u201d Tim Sands, the president of Virginia Tech, was one of the rare college presidents who explicitly suggested in his postelection message that students might have a range of emotions about the outcome, or as he put it, be experiencing feelings \u201cfrom vindication to shock, from outright fear to enthusiasm. \u201d Michigan students say that before the election, attitudes were less intense. \u201cIt was more like friendly banter, little side comments, but it wasn\u2019t really serious,\u201d said Anna Giacomini, an elected representative to the student government for the liberal arts college at the university. Now tensions are heightened. According to a campuswide message from Mark Schlissel, the university\u2019s president, bias incidents have been reported. A student walking near campus was threatened with being lit on fire because she wore a hijab. Other students were accused of being racist for supporting Mr. Trump. A few days ago, Ms. Delekta and two fellow Republican students sat down at a local restaurant, Sava\u2019s, to talk about the campus mood with several students with   views. The conversation soon grew tense as the students were unable to agree on almost anything. Ms. Delekta described how she had been offended when a classmate wondered why as a \u201cwhite female,\u201d she had not voted for Hillary Clinton. She resented what she saw as identity politics on campus. \u201cMy identity is so much more than my race and my gender,\u201d Ms. Delekta said. \u201cWe\u2019re all so much more similar than we think. \u201d She was able to separate Mr. Trump\u2019s policies from his personal attitudes toward women, she said later. \u201cI\u2019m not electing a grandpa or a babysitter,\u201d Ms. Delekta said. Ibtihal Makki, a   senior in a pink hijab who is studying biopsychology and neuroscience and is chairwoman of a student government diversity committee, objected to conservatives on campus saying they needed safe spaces to express their views. \u201cTo turn around and say that they need safe spaces after their candidate won I think is ironic and hypocritical,\u201d Ms. Makki said. In the past, she added, conservatives did not understand the need for safe spaces, \u201cbecause they never needed it, because they don\u2019t have any of the identities that made them feel that way. \u201d White conservatives like Ms. Delekta, Ms. Makki said, are not as vulnerable as someone with dark skin or who is wearing a hijab, because she cannot be identified as a conservative by any outward signs. Another student, Maryam Ahmed, said she had been one of about 1, 000 students who marched in the campus vigil the day after the election. She said the marchers were positive but feared for their safety. Her friends were passing on text messages  \u2014   which turned out to be false  \u2014   warning that white militias were going to invade the streets of Ann Arbor. \u201cThere was definitely a divisiveness that came on campus postelection,\u201d she said. \u201cThe election was like a needle poking into a bubble. \u201d She said she was hopeful the climate would improve, but added: \u201cI could be wrong. It could get worse. \u201d When Ms. Delekta met with Michigan\u2019s president, Dr. Schlissel, she brought Enrique Zalamea, president of the College Republicans, along with her. They proposed a kind of unity campaign for campus, in which students would march with signs saying, \u201cI am a Wolverine,\u201d to stress their similarities. And they suggested some   sessions on inclusivity and diversity. Dr. Schlissel told them that it was too early for such activities, and that they should allow a   period first, Ms. Delekta said. She was deeply disappointed. \u201cThat\u2019s not my personality,\u201d she said. Dr. Schlissel declined to comment on the mood on campus, but a spokeswoman, Kim Broekhuizen, said Ms. Delekta\u2019s account of the meeting was accurate. Still Ms. Delekta was heartened by the meeting, seeing it as a sign that conservatives might be invited into the fold. She is hoping to score tickets to the inauguration, the beginning of a new era, she believes, for better. But she will not be surprised, she said, if tensions flare anew. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be right back in the media,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people are going to start to get worked up again, whether it be in excitement or frustration and fear. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561986.2940547}
