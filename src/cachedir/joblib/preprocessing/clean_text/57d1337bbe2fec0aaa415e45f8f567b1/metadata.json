But during an untamed time, not long ago, New Yorkers routinely slid open the doors at the ends of train cars and stood in the open space as the train hurtled through the tunnel. New Yorkers like the future president of the United States. \u201cI understand the subway very well,\u201d President Trump told The New York Times on Wednesday when quizzed about his knowledge of the city\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cI used to ride between the cars. \u201d That was in his days at   School in Queens, Mr. Trump said, which were in the late 1950s. As the city and the subway system deteriorated in subsequent decades, riding between cars became part of the chaotic subterranean landscape: Trains were covered with graffiti and broke down often, passengers smoked cigarettes or worse, and doors between cars banged open and shut of their own accord, practically inviting trespass. \u201cThe people who ride our system now consider the ability to cross between cars their personal right,\u201d a subway official wrote in 1983 to a federal safety board that was pressing the Transit Authority to outlaw crossing between cars when the trains were stopped. A   law against traveling between the cars of a moving train was already on the books. On an N train on Thursday, Ronald Dupree, a bouncer and car salesman who grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, recalled his childhood pastime fondly. \u201cIt was something to do  \u2014   you\u2019d feel the breeze,\u201d Mr. Dupree, 46, said. The police \u201cdidn\u2019t care about it back then,\u201d he said. About a decade ago, the police began cracking down, after it was finally made illegal in 2005 to cross between cars of a stopped train. The fine for switching cars is $75. \u201cSeven years ago, I was cutting from one car to the other and I got a summons,\u201d Mr. Dupree said. \u201cI haven\u2019t done it since then. \u201d Benjamin Kabak, who writes the Second Ave. Sagas subway blog, said that he seldom sees people riding between cars anymore. In wilder times, passengers moved between cars for reasons other than fun. Jake Dobkin, the founder of the news site Gothamist who writes the Ask a Native New Yorker column, would switch cars in the early 1990s \u201cto escape particularly strong smells or danger,\u201d like groups of bigger youths who seemed intent on mugging him. If a train was too crowded to board, passengers on the platform would push open the folding gates connecting the cars and let themselves on that way. \u201cThat was a great   trick,\u201d said Kevin Dresser, a graphic designer who moved to the city in the early \u201990s. These days, doors between cars are locked on some lines, though they still open on others. An   exploit on an N train Thursday morning confirmed that a childhood impression had not changed: To stand between cars, with the East River or the F. D. R. Drive rushing vertiginously beneath you, gripping the black rubber straps and feeling the connected cars shift under your feet, remains an exhilarating experience. Not that you should do it. Ever. In recent years, several people  lost their footing and fell to their deaths. In December, a man tumbled between cars of an F train in Manhattan and was decapitated. On Thursday, Chief Joseph Fox of the New York Police Department\u2019s transit bureau took to Twitter to warn riders: Don\u2019t be like the president. But there are times when a locked door poses its own dangers. On Tuesday, Rebecca Odes was on an F train in Brooklyn and the doors did not open when it got to her station. She went to the end of the car and tried the door. It would not budge. \u201cIt was pretty freaky to be trapped,\u201d she said. The doors opened after a couple of minutes. Still, Ms. Odes, a   of Wifey. tv, said, \u201cas the mother of a teenager now I feel like there is a certain comfort in knowing that hanging out between cars is not an option. \u201d The president\u2019s parents might have wished for the same. \u201cThey were not happy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI used to love to do that. Those were the old days. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628535.73305}
