How wedded is he on issues of immigration? Is there flexibility, is he going to move? And if he is going to move, how best to do it?\u201d he anticipated.  Schweizer said it would be interesting to watch the reaction from world leaders to their interactions with Trump, looking for indications they are willing to move toward his position on contentious issues, or that they believe he is willing to move toward theirs. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a pretty good sense in the next couple of days precisely what their assessment is of the new American president,\u201d he predicted. Marlow asked for Schweizer\u2019s take on the news that President Trump\u2019s    Jared Kushner has become a focus of the investigation into possible Russian interference with the 2016 election. \u201cFirst of all, Jared Kushner has significant ties to people in Russia, meaning financial ties, deals that have been done,\u201d Schweizer responded. \u201cSome of those are direct ties with investors where he shares investments in a company. In other instances, they\u2019re people that perhaps are investors that are now based out of Israel, but are very tied commercially to Russia. That\u2019s the first part of it. \u201d \u201cThe second part of it, though, is what\u2019s kind of emerged is that some of the individuals that popped up initially in the Russia investigation  \u2014   Paul Manafort, for example  \u2014   we now know that actually Paul Manafort, one of the reasons he was hired or brought into the Trump circle was in part because Jared Kushner thought it would be a good idea,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s really the main reason why the FBI is looking,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be very clear, when the FBI uses the term \u2018person of interest,\u2019 that does not mean that they\u2019re saying they\u2019ve committed a crime. What they\u2019re looking for is for him to talk and share with them about what he knows, as it relates to individuals, actions, deals that might have been done. They\u2019re simply saying, \u2018this is a guy that is going to have interesting things to say to us, and will help us in the investigation. \u2019\u201d  \u201cWe want to be clear and make sure people know it does not mean that there\u2019s guilt. It does not mean that he is obstructing or not cooperating. They are simply saying, \u2018this is an individual that we are talking to,\u2019\u201d Schweizer stressed. \u201cI think the accounts are so far that he is talking to them and trying to be cooperative. \u201d  \u201cBut it\u2019s a major change and shift in the investigation, really for a couple of reasons,\u201d he noted. \u201cFirst of all, it means they\u2019ve moved away from simply looking at Paul Manafort and Carter Page  \u2014   people that are no longer part of Trump\u2019s inner circle, that were essentially let go during the campaign. It second of all means that you now have a family member that they are saying played some kind of role, in some way, in negotiations or discussions with individuals that might be tied to the Russians. \u201d Marlow asked if it was surprising to see the media swarm on Kushner when \u201cby all accounts, he seems like a guy who agrees mostly with the worldview of the establishment press. \u201d Schweizer saw it as important evidence against the notion that \u201cif you appease the political Left on certain political views, they\u2019re going to leave you alone. \u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way, because the political Left wants everything,\u201d he contended. \u201cThey don\u2019t want something, they want everything, which means they want their people in there. That\u2019s how the game is played. \u201d \u201cI think the reason that Jared Kushner is getting a lot of attention is simply because he is viewed by many people as perhaps the most powerful person in the White House, other than the president himself,\u201d Schweizer speculated. \u201cNow, that of course is subject to debate, but that I think is the perception. Part of that is not just because of the real power, but because he\u2019s related to the president. You can\u2019t fire your    per se. He\u2019s always going to have a seat at the table. \u201d Referring to a New York Times piece on Kushner\u2019s real estate holdings, Schweizer observed that Kushner owns a large number of   residential properties. \u201cThe company that he owns has a reputation for being very, very tough on renters. If their rent payment is a couple of hours late, they will get a notice of eviction claims from tenants that they\u2019re not very responsive to repairs,\u201d Schweizer observed.  \u201cBut something that I think is overlooked in this very long article is really one sentence, which talks about the fact that he procured thousands of these apartments in 2011, really at   prices, with the financial backing of Freddie Mac  \u2014   which is the federal government\u2019s financing agency,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that sets off alarm bells because you have an instance here where it looks like Jared Kushner benefited from this sort of crony capitalism government program. A business professional who benefits from these kinds of programs, it automatically raises concerns that they now become advocates for those types of government programs,\u201d he noted.  \u201cI think part of it is, you do have this issue with   apartments, people complaining about draconian management agencies and the unfairness. Of course, there\u2019s two sides to those stories. We don\u2019t know where the truth lies. But the issue of the crony capitalism to me is the bigger concern, because again when it comes to the very difficult question of cutting government programs, particularly crony capitalism programs, perhaps there\u2019s going to be more reluctance for supporting those initiatives by Jared Kushner because he\u2019s benefited from them,\u201d said Schweizer.
