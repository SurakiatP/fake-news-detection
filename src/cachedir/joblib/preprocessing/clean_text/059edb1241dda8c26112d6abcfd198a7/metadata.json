The Logan family find rubber bats, monster masks and eating shitloads of chocolate problematic, but still believe they can join in the fun. Project manager Tom Logan said: \u201cOur daughter wanted a witch costume so I had to explain they were actually just medieval herbalists stigmatised by a patriarchal society and weren\u2019t green or warty. \u201cWe wanted her to wear something non-gender specific for trick-or-treating so we\u2019ve decided to dress her as a piece of organic wheat.\u201d The Logans\u2019 son Edward wanted to wear a ghost outfit but this also proved problematic given the family\u2019s firm atheist beliefs, which reject the possibility of life after death. Instead he will be dressed as a starving 15th century peasant farmer who is being oppressed by the feudal system. Edward Logan said: \u201cWe\u2019re only allowed to go to the houses of other children from our school, all treats must be non-dairy or made of carob. It\u2019s going to be beyond shit. \u201cLuckily we\u2019ve got the ouija board for after mum and dad have gone to bed.\u201d \\nSave'"}, "time": 1742563301.727979}
