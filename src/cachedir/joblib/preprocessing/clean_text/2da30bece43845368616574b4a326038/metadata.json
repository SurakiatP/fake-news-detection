[\u201cThe [21 officials\u2019] job was to go meet politicians, Congress people, advocate groups, and local law enforcement,\u201d complained Sarah Salda\u00f1a, a top DHS official from 2014 to early 2017.  \u201cLet them see you as a person, as opposed to big, bad ICE,\u201d said Saldana, who created the cooperation program when she ran DHS\u2019s U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement division from 2014 to 2017.  Trump\u2019s DHS executives \u201creally are taking away the [21 officials\u2019] ability to go out in the community and do what it is that we were hoping they would get done,\u201d Salda\u00f1a told Foreign Policy magazine. The \u201cwe\u201d in her comment refers to the Democratic Party, which replaced by the   Trump administration on January 20. The 21 employees assigned to the program have now been assigned to Trump\u2019s new Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office, which helps Americans recover from the huge number of crimes inflicted by the illegal aliens who were allowed into the country during President Barack Obama\u2019s   tenure. VOICE is just a \u201creport your local illegal\u201d program, Saldana responded. \u201cFrom what I understand is being reported, it\u2019s: \u2018Oh, I see my   neighbor\u2019s landscaper. He looks Mexican. I want to report him. Maybe someone ought to pick him up,\u2019\u201d said Saldana, who told a Capitol Hill panel in 2015 that ICE\u2019s job was \u201cpublic safety,\u201d not actual enforcement of the nation\u2019s popular immigration laws. According to Foreign Policy: Salda\u00f1a maintains that before Trump\u2019s election ICE was poised to greatly expand the outreach program and \u201cremove the curtain\u201d from immigration enforcement activities. Community relations officers were being trained to assuage fear in immigrant communities with facts about the agency\u2019s priorities and activities. Since 2014, ICE\u2019s focus has changed [from deporting illegals] to deporting violent criminals, gang members, and recent arrivals. Salda\u00f1a said this policy opened the door to building trust with a variety of community groups, encouraging them to report serious criminal activity   \u2026     \u201cI was trying to go out to the communities and explain: \u2018We are interested in criminals, not in the family of four who has been here 40 years and has not broken any other laws,\u2019\u201d Salda\u00f1a said. Under Obama, federal officials slashed efforts to repatriate illegals and even foreign criminals. DHS Secretary John Kelly directed the new policy change in a February 25, 2017 memo, where he said:  I direct the Director of ICE to immediately reallocate any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens (except as necessary to comply with a judicial order) to the new VOICE Office, and to immediately terminate the provision of such outreach or advocacy services to illegal aliens. Analysts estimate that roughly 11 million illegal aliens are living in the United States. Roughly 8 million of the illegals hold jobs, which adds up to one job for each of the four million young Americans who turn 18 each year. The illegals\u2019 inclusion in the nation\u2019s labor pool makes it harder for young Americans to get   jobs, and annually transfers roughly $500 billion from employees to employers, according to George Borjas, a Harvard professor. In addition, illegal immigrants inflict a huge number of crimes on Americans.  For example, almost   of a million aliens were registered at Texas jails from June 2011 to May 2017. Their convictions included 496 murders, 26, 000 assaults, 8, 400 burglaries, 246 kidnappings and 2, 900 sexual assaults.  '"}, "time": 1742563160.5359008}
