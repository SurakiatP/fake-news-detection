After President Trump vowed to put \u201cAmerican first,\u201d a Dutch television show made a satirical case for why the president should consider its country second. Now, the race for   has spread. Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland have all joined in with videos that capture the president\u2019s trademark bombast, demonstrating a rare case of European unity through satire  \u2014   and  . In the Dutch video, a     runs through a list of the country\u2019s hallmarks and traditions that may pique Mr. Trump\u2019s interest: the language, the tax code, the windmills and Black Pete, a contentious Christmas tradition in which Dutch people wear blackface. (\u201cIt\u2019s the most offensive, the most racist thing you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d the voice says. It adds: \u201cYou\u2019ll love it. It\u2019s great. \u201d) Arjen Lubach, a Dutch   host whose show, \u201cZondag met Lubach\u201d (\u201cSunday With Lubach\u201d) made the video that started the trend, said, \u201cBecause we realize it\u2019s better for us to get along, we decided to introduce our tiny country to him in a way that will probably appeal to him the most. \u201d The     on this video belongs to a   American comedian named Greg Shapiro. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on the imitation for a while,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said in a phone interview on Sunday from Paris. All it takes, he said, is repeating Mr. Trump\u2019s interviews or tweets verbatim. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly any heightening necessary,\u201d he said. After the video went viral, Mr. Shapiro said, \u201cit was nice having family from America send me these clips saying, \u2018Oh, this is like Dutch and Trump.\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s my voice.\u2019 My mom did recognize it. \u201d Mr. Shapiro, 48, has seen a bump on his YouTube channel, where he offers lessons in Trump impressions on his \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d show and posted a spoof news conference on Monday, in which he impersonates the president. Germany\u2019s video pleads its case  \u2014   and expresses indignation that the Netherlands beat it to the idea. Its video lists Oktoberfest, the country\u2019s experience with walls and Hitler, who, the video notes, \u201cmade Germany great again. \u201d \u201cGermany wants to be second,\u201d Jan B\u00f6hmermann, host of the talk show \u201cNeo Magazin Royale,\u201d said in the video. \u201cBecause we are strong, we are big, and who  \u2014   if not us  \u2014   deserves a third chance?\u201d (Last year, Mr. B\u00f6hmermann\u2019s satire of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan caused an international incident.) What did the Swiss think Mr. Trump would like about their country? The video championed the nation\u2019s mountains (it\u2019s not flat like the Netherlands) its nonmembership in the European Union and its cleanliness. It also said Mr. Trump, who was caught on video boasting about sexual assault, might appreciate the country\u2019s history on women\u2019s rights. \u201cWe also love to treat our women badly,\u201d the Trump impersonator in its video said. \u201cLove it. We didn\u2019t let them vote until 1971. In some places, even until 1990. \u201d It added: \u201cYou love gold? We love gold. During World War II, the Jews gave it to us for safekeeping. They never returned  \u2014   so strange  \u2014   so we melted it, like fondue, our national dish. \u201d Portugal\u2019s video noted that Portuguese has an untranslatable word, \u201csaudade,\u201d a combination of longing and nostalgia. \u201cWe can assure you that \u2018saudade\u2019 is something that billions of people are feeling right now about Barack Obama. \u201d It also jokes that its prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, like Mr. Trump, came to power without winning the popular vote. \u201cIf you have any problems with Putin  \u2014   which you will  \u2014   immediately call Ant\u00f3nio Costa,\u201d it said. Belgium extended an olive branch to Mr. Trump in its video, agreeing with his comments last March that its capital, Brussels, was a \u201chellhole,\u201d but urging him to check out the   north of the country. (It dismissed the French speaking south as \u201cthe Mexicans of Belgium\u201d and told him to steer clear.) Denmark\u2019s video, broadcast by the talk show \u201cNatholdet\u201d (\u201cThe Nightshift\u201d) explained the difference between Danes and danishes, and cited Hans Christian Andersen, creator of beloved fairy tales, as a point in the country\u2019s favor. \u201cYou have the Statue of Liberty, we have the Little Mermaid,\u201d the video\u2019s Trump impersonator said. \u201cBut don\u2019t let the name fool you, O. K.? The Little Mermaid is actually pretty huge. \u201d In its video, Luxembourg boasted, \u201cWe have money, a lot of money,\u201d adding: \u201cAnd you know what, Mr. President? You don\u2019t even have to pay taxes. None. Zero. Nada. Promise. \u201d Lithuania, a small Baltic country and NATO member that has been rattled by Mr. Trump\u2019s fondness for Russia, attempted to win him over with its fast internet speed. \u201cJust imagine how fast you can tweet when you have the fastest internet?\u201d The video added that the Lithuanian president is a woman. \u201cShe probably rigged the election,\u201d the   said.'"}, "time": 1742561848.7345204}
