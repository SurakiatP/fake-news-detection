Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. \\nIsrael blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. \\nKara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. \\nAccording to Kara, Pope Francis \u201c strongly disagreed \u201d with the resolution. \\n\u201c He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel, \u201d the deputy minister stressed. \\nAs for surviving the natural disaster, the Israeli politician said that \u201c going through the earthquake was not the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562224.9287863}
