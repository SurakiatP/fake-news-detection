[The government imports 1 million new legal immigrants per year, even as 4 million young Americans turn 18, but according to Bloomberg:  Immigration to the U. S. has failed to make up for the number of residents leaving New York, Los Angeles and Chicago  \u2014   the nation\u2019s top three metropolitan areas. Chicago  \u2014   beset by crime, economic and budgetary woes and high taxes  \u2014   is the net exodus leader among 100 metro areas tracked by Bloomberg using Census Bureau data for the year through July 1, 2016. An average 245 local residents left the Windy City each day compared with the arrival of 71 foreigners. Census doesn\u2019t inquire about a person\u2019s citizenship status  \u2026     For the nation\u2019s third   metropolitan area, foreign immigration \u201cis the only offset we\u2019ve got and it would be tragic to lose,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief executive and founder of DS Economics in Chicago.  Rising government taxes, rental and housing prices in the   cities help push ambitious young Americans towards southern cities, such as Dallas, Austin, Tampa, Orlando, Atlanta, and Charlotte.  Some other coastal cities are also gaining population from arriving Americans, principally Seattle and Portland. But immigration is so high in Miami that it is pushing out Americans, just like in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.  Young people are leaving the crowded cities, in part, because elite jobs and large immigrant populations combine to push up property prices and taxes, while also holding down the salaries and wages needed to start families. \u201cIn the New York metropolitan area,   Manhattan prospers while old factory towns such as Paterson, New Jersey, and Waterbury, Connecticut, languish   \u2026     While Los Angeles gained more than 54, 000 international migrants, it lost more than 87, 000 people due to domestic migration,\u201d said Bloomberg. That is bad news for conservatives in those states because GOP candidates tend to sweep districts with where   voters can afford to set up homes. Those trends were reflected in the 2016 election, where Trump won 26 of 27    states. As more Americans migrate southwards, they are likely to bring more   voters to their new districts, which help offset the huge immigrant inflow of   residents. Read the article here.
