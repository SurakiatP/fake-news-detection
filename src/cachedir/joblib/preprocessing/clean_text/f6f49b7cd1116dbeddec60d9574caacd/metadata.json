Brown, captured, perhaps unwittingly, the dueling imperatives a prosecutor faces in a case that strikes at an entire community. Mr. Brown\u2019s primary task in issuing the statement was to announce that his office was charging Oscar Morel, the man accused in the killings, with   murder, based on the fact that the daylight shooting had caused the deaths of at least two people. But in a more emotive tone, the district attorney also extended his \u201cdeepest sympathy\u201d to the families of the victims and then made a promise: He would \u201cwork tirelessly to ensure that justice is done. \u201d New York City\u2019s five district attorneys are never just dispassionate executors of the law. As elected officials who draw their powers  \u2014   and their paychecks  \u2014   from the public, they at times assume a more symbolic role: that of the community defender, one who is responsive to, and responsible for, the constituents they serve. The community in this case, a Muslim enclave in Ozone Park, clearly called for a response from Mr. Brown as many in the neighborhood fearfully described the killings of the men, Alauddin Akonjee and Thara Miah, as a hate crime. That put Mr. Brown in a complicated position, several lawyers said. The police, so far, have not determined a motive for the murders  \u2014   let alone found evidence of a hate crime. So Mr. Brown, a Democrat, had to file charges that were factually and tactically defensible while still being seen as answering the neighborhood\u2019s anxious call as firmly as he could. \u201cHe was responding to the technical requirements of the law, but also to public pressure  \u2014   there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d said Murray Richman, a veteran member of the city\u2019s defense bar. \u201cWhile he came forward with the right charge, a lot of it was political. Whenever there\u2019s something that agitates a particular group, you don\u2019t have a choice. You have to respond. \u201d While prosecutors do not have to establish motive to charge people with a crime, it is an essential part of their subsequent efforts to prove their case at trial. Should Mr. Morel go to trial, an assistant district attorney will want to furnish to the jury a credible explanation for why he undertook two murders that he has denied committing. Some lawyers said that in the absence of a motive, it was a bit unusual to have accused Mr. Morel of   murder. \u201cIt would seem to me that murder in the first degree is all about motive,\u201d Gerald L. Shargel, another veteran defense lawyer, said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need it, but it is definitely relevant to the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Was this the guy who did it because, say, he had pictures of other Muslim leaders on his basement wall?\u201d Other lawyers, though, said that by pursuing a   charge, Mr. Brown relieved himself of the strategic burden of establishing a motive at a trial. The police and prosecutors say they have evidence indicating that Mr. Morel intentionally killed Mr. Akonjee and Mr. Miah. Under the law,   murder can narrowly be defined as the intentional killing of more than one person. \u201cIf what we\u2019re hearing is true,\u201d said Mark Bederow, a lawyer who has handled several murder cases, \u201cthen the guy walked up, boom, boom, and the cops found the gun. It\u2019s easily provable  \u2014   a nice, clean case. \u201d A bias case would be much more difficult to prove, Mr. Bederow said. A   killing is, by definition, a   murder charge, so Mr. Brown would have not been able to deliver the same impact that comes with   murder. But more important, by filing   charges, prosecutors would assume the obligation of offering a motive  \u2014   which is to say, that Mr. Morell had acted out of intolerance or hate  \u2014   and proving it. \u201cThey would literally be promising the jury, \u2018We are going to tell you why this happened,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bederow said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s just no need to do that. It\u2019s messy. That\u2019s the last thing you want  \u2014   a messy case. Though I\u2019ll admit, that\u2019s just the cold analysis of a lawyer. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563758.5989196}
