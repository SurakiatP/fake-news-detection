In this three-part video series, which is part of Roqayah Chamseddine\u2019s project, \u201cIslam In America,\u201d Springer talks about the difficulty of fighting homophobia in Islamic spaces. \\n\u201cOftentimes, if we\u2019re being completely honest, I don\u2019t fight it,\u201d Springer confesses. \u201cI really don\u2019t. I stay silent most of the time. I\u2019m very courageous when I\u2019m at the front line of a protest, but then when you put me in a room with my umma, I stay silent. I think that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\\nAs Springer shares, he used to fight homophobia when faced with it at his mosque and the Muslim student association at his school. But he has chosen silence lately just like women tired of trying to fight sexism or misogyny in Islam might choose silence. \\nMuslims choose silence because they want to be \u201cmodel minorities,\u201d according to Springer. \\n\u201cSo many Muslims are concerned with being a model minority and trying to paint this perfect picture of Islam, and it\u2019s damaging. We want to live up to white supremacy and to whiteness and to all these Americanisms so much that we\u2019re not willing to address the very problems in our communities. It has to stop,\u201d Springer declares.\\n\u201cWe\u2019re not model minorities. The model minority doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a myth just to get people to assimilate.\u201d\\nRoqayah\u2019s \u201cIslam In America\u201d series is an ongoing project , which amplifies the stories of American Muslims and what they struggle with in their day-to-day lives beyond just Islamophobia. It promotes an alternative to the fear of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential administration.\\nThe post Interview: Devyn Springer, Queer Black Muslim, On Homophobia In Islamic Spaces appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n'"}, "time": 1742628505.7410102}
