As she carries on with her sparsely-planned campaign stops in the final days of the election, Iowans were shocked to see what she brought with her to her speech right after the investigation was announced. \\nNo matter how hard Hillary tries, everything she hides seems to have a way of coming out. Karma is certainly working in favor of the American citizens who deserve to know the truth about this woman trying to bully her way into the White House. \\nWhen she was in Iowa this weekend, just hours after the FBI announced they are re-opening the investigation into her e-mails thanks to her right-hand woman\u2019s dirty husband, Hillary brought a familiar \u201cfriend\u201d that the public couldn\u2019t ignore, which is why photos of it have now gone viral. During the second presidential debate, we were first introduced to Hillary\u2019s ironic nemesis, which wasn\u2019t just her opponent Donald Trump. \\nA fly pestered the Democratic candidate on live TV as she spoke, sticking to her and never touching Trump in what seemed symbolic since she stinks of lies and everyone knows flies are attracted to garbage. As embarrassing\u00c2 as this may have been for Hillary, she can\u2019t pass it off as a random event since it happened again in a completely different state. That\u2019s right \u00e2\\x80\\x94 while she was in Iowa, a fly once again\u00c2 wouldn\u2019t leave her face. Can't even make this up. How many times has a FLY landed on Crooked Rotten Hillary now?! Today at Cedar Rapids, Iowa. pic.twitter.com/tu0Ivw8rFa \\n\u2014 R\u00ce\u0105\u0143\\x83 M\u00ce\u0105\u010e\\x87\u00ce\u0161\u0110\u017a\u010e \u0143\\x95 \u0111\\x9f\\x87\u015f\u0111\\x9f\\x87\u00b8 (@sooperay) October 28, 2016 \\nApparently, there\u2019s something about Hillary\u2019s face that flies flock to. and it\u2019s probably the same thing most Americans find so repulsive. It\u2019s not coincidental that this has now happened twice to this candidate in less than a month, and perhaps the fly is just a sign of what the FBI investigation is about to uncover. \\nLike a crow symbolizing death, the black fly during this election represents the end of Hillary\u2019s campaign since it seems to sense everything she\u2019s trying to hide.\""}, "time": 1742628589.5955062}
