Had a Democratic candidate done the same, they would be standing atop every high hill they could find and shouting that it was the end of the world and human morality. \\nNow we have wackobird conspiracy theorist Wayne Allyn Root weighing in on the matter, and the reason he gives Trump a pass on the sexual assault is because he says there\u2019s just no way it could have happened because Trump is too handsome to have committed such an act. \\nAppearing on the \u201cThe Real Side\u201d radio show, Root laid out this line of bullcrap : \u201cIf you\u2019re a Christian, you just can\u2019t spend your life worrying about the words of Donald Trump from 11 years ago or what women he groped 30 years ago. I don\u2019t believe any of it anyway. I believe Donald Trump is one of the handsomest billionaires that\u2019s ever lived; I don\u2019t think he ever had to grope a single woman ever. I think they threw themselves at him, so it\u2019s all a lie.\u201d \\nYeah, because a handsome man would never ever force himself on a woman. Are you kidding me?! Root then went on to add : \u201cThe man isn\u2019t a perfect Christian, but he\u2019s the perfect guy sent from God and from central casting to be the vicious guy we needed to save America, save capitalism, fight the Clinton crime cartel and save Christianity from these vicious, vicious people. They\u2019re terrible, dirty people and a nice guy could have never won this war. Only a dirty player could win the war, so I think Donald\u2019s the perfect guy, sent by God to fill the perfect role and save us all.\u201d \\nThere actually are no perfect Christians; that\u2019s kinda the point of that whole Jesus died for your sins thing, Wayne. And if you think a person as vile and perverted as Donald Trump was sent by God, then clearly you don\u2019t know this line from the Bible: \u201cAnd again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d ( Matthew 19:24 ) \\nHere\u2019s Root proving his own ignorance: \\nFeatured Image Via OSGA About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
