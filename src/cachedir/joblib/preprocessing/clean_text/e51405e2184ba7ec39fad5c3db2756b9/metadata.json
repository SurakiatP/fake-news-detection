We knew them,\u201d Assaf told Dr. Yvette Isaac, who works for the advocacy group, according to the UK Mirror. \\n\u201cAfter that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine,\u201d Assaf said, according to media reports. \u201cThey were put in the dough mixer, they were kneaded. The oldest one of them was four-years-old.\u201d \\nISIS transported hundreds of girls to the city of Douma, which has been at the center of the Syrian civil war, to be slaughtered. ISIS has been systematically killing non-Muslims, and the majority of its victims at the time were Christian. \\nAssaf said her own son, George, was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a Muslim name. \\n\u201cMy son said to me, \u2018No, mother, I don\u2019t want to die with an identity not my own. I prefer to die with the name George,'\u201d Assaf said, according to the Christian Post. \\nAssaf added, \u201cI asked my son then to hide, but he refused and said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to hide myself.
