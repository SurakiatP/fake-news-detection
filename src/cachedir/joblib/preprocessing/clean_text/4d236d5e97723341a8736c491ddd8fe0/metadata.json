The two reportedly discussed tensions in the Middle East with a focus on \u201cconfronting Iran\u2019s destabilizing regional activities. \u201d[According to Gulf news network   Salman and Mattis held a   discussion for \u201cover three hours\u201d and created an \u201catmosphere of consensus\u201d regarding the Islamist threats facing both countries in the region. The Pentagon statement confirmed that containing the influence of Iran  \u2014   whose terror proxies are playing major roles in conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen  \u2014   took up much of their conversation.  The prince, who also serves as Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense minister, told reporters, \u201cSaudi Arabia is ready to send its troops to Syria as the country would do all it takes to eradicate terrorism,\u201d according to  . The network adds that Mattis and Salman were joined by \u201cChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, the National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, the President\u2019s senior counselor for economic initiatives Dina Powel, the White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, and senior defense and foreign ministry officials. \u201d The conversation followed a meeting with President Trump Wednesday, after which a spokesman for the prince issued a glowing statement of the U. S. president. \u201cPrince Mohammed considers his Excellency [Trump] as a true friend of Muslims who will serve the Muslim World in an unimaginable manner,\u201d the statement read in part, \u201copposite to the negative portrait of his Excellency [Trump] that some have tried to promote. \u201d The prince also appeared to support President Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the American southern border: \u201cBoth sides discussed the Saudi successful experience in building a fence on the   border, which led to preventing illegal entrance of individuals, as well as preventing smuggling operations. \u201d The prince also appeared to support President Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the American southern border: \u201cBoth sides discussed the Saudi successful experience in building a fence on the   border, which led to preventing illegal entrance of individuals, as well as preventing smuggling operations. \u201d Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s meeting with President Trump occurred as King Salman attended scheduled meetings with senior Communist Party officials in China, seeking further investment into the Saudi economy. The emphasis on containing Iran highlights Saudi tensions with the largest Shiite Muslim country in the world, which it regularly accuses of playing a key role in exporting terrorism worldwide. Saudi Arabia itself has a checked history of exporting Wahhabism, an extremist strain of jihadist Islam, and Saudi government officials have been implicated in some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the world. Saudi Arabia is currently seeking to overturn a law that allows the victims of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks to sue the kingdom for damages, citing  \u2019s communications with Saudi government officials. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry has taken the opportunity of the meeting between Mattis and the prince to condemn Saudi Arabia once again, calling his visit to Washington \u201cdeluded and fallacious\u201d and accusing Saudi Arabia of war crimes. Mohammed bin Salman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, was \u201cone of the main directors of the Saudi war on the innocent and defenseless Yemeni nation, and the manifestation of terror and horror in Syria, Bahrain and other regional and world countries. \u201d \u201cThe history of the Middle East will teach all, especially   states who have through the fantasy and illusion [of being able] to buy security moved to offer a green light to the intervention of foreign players, that they are making a huge mistake because previous interventions by   powers have only led to insecurity in countries and the states that have summoned the foreign powers,\u201d Qassemi warned.'"}, "time": 1742562983.1294224}
