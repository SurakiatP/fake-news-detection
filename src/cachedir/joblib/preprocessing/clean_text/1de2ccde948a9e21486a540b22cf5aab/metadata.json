Their message is blunt and unforgiving, with the goal of reawakening some of the most extensive conservative   networks in the country. It is a reminder that even as Republicans control both the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade, the party\u2019s activist wing remains restless and will not go along passively for the sake of party unity. With angry constituents storming town   meetings across the country and demanding that Congress not repeal the law, these new campaigns are a sign of a growing concern on the right that lawmakers might buckle to the pressure. \u201cWe\u2019ve been patient this year, but it is past time to act and to act decisively,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, which is coordinating the push with other groups across the Kochs\u2019 political network. \u201cOur network has spent more money, more time and more years fighting Obamacare than anything else. And now with the finish line in sight, we cannot allow some folks to pull up and give up. \u201d The new mantra could be summed up as repeal, replace or revolt. Beyond the Koch network, other   conservative groups like the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks are also increasing the pressure. All together, the new campaigns will involve advertising, rallies, phone calls to the Capitol switchboard and efforts to confront lawmakers in their offices with documentation of their own words about the need for repeal. The Koch groups are calling their campaign \u201cYou Promised,\u201d and are prepared to spend heavily, they said. The initial phase, which will cost in the low six figures, will include a nationwide digital advertising campaign featuring testimonials from people who say they were harmed by the Affordable Care Act. On Tuesday, the groups will kick off the effort with a rally near the Capitol, from which they will dispatch activists to congressional offices. Beyond that, Americans for Prosperity said it was prepared to bring \u201csignificant resources\u201d to bear as needed. FreedomWorks, which is planning a rally in Washington on March 15 to inaugurate its \u201cmonth of action\u201d on the Affordable Care Act, is sending its activists to Capitol Hill armed with sheafs of paper with quotes from Republicans who have called for repeal. The plan is to track down those Republicans and make them face their own words. \u201cI think that the only way we get members of Congress to stay the course on this is with constituent pressure,\u201d said Noah Wall, the national director of campaigns for FreedomWorks. If that does not work at first, he added, \u201cI\u2019m going to fill their offices with really angry constituents, and they\u2019re going to listen. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019m going to go back into their district and fill their district offices with angry constituents. And we\u2019ll do this again and again. \u201d The sudden caution of the Republican Party leadership, as it grapples with the enormously complicated challenge of replacing the Affordable Care Act, has baffled conservatives who have been fighting the health law for years. In the House, Republicans have voted dozens of times to dismantle the law, and it has been a primary issue in congressional races since 2010. Repealing the law, many conservative lawmakers believe, is the one clear mandate they have from voters. \u201cThe reality is, this is existential for Republicans,\u201d said David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, which has been sending emails regularly to its 100, 000 members warning that Republicans could be stalling the repeal indefinitely. The group plans to directly target party leaders like Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, in a new phase of the campaign. \u201cIf they don\u2019t repeal Obamacare and replace it,\u201d Mr. McIntosh added, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll stay in the majority in the next election. \u201d Implicit in the repeal push is a threat that conservative groups have always wielded over the party when they feel it is not being true to its convictions: primary challenges. And this early rift between the party\u2019s activist wing and its leadership in Washington could be a taste of what Republicans can expect now that they control the government entirely and are no longer able to blame Democrats for blocking their agenda. After making bold promises over the past few years on issues like overhauling expensive government programs, rewriting the tax code and defunding Planned Parenthood, Republicans face voter demands to follow through. Republicans remain unable to agree on a health care plan that satisfies both moderates and  . As President Trump himself acknowledged last week when he tried to explain the delay  \u2014   \u201cNobody knew that health care could be so complicated,\u201d he said  \u2014   it is no easy task to pass a measure that could leave millions uninsured. And polls now show American\u2019s attitudes toward the law are improving as they worry about what could happen if it is suddenly jettisoned. Democrats, who have been cramming town   meetings to implore Republican lawmakers not to take apart the health law, seem content to let their opponents fight it out in the hope that the divisions will lead to an impasse. \u201cTheir rhetoric that has enabled them to stir up the far right is in collision with the truth,\u201d said Thomas E. Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The repeal effort by the conservative groups is intended to sway members of Congress who may be hesitating because of public pressure back home. That pressure, conservatives said, is no reason to renege. \u201cThis issue has been litigated in four federal elections, and the result has been historic Republican majorities in Congress,\u201d Mr. Phillips of Americans for Prosperity said. \u201cThat\u2019s why there is no sympathy when some Republicans talk about contentious town halls or a few hundred calls into their office. \u201d Americans for Prosperity, which has spent tens of millions of dollars in advertising opposing the Affordable Care Act, is bringing back some of the subjects of its initial ads  \u2014   ordinary people who spoke about the problems with \u201c  medicine\u201d  \u2014   for its new push. And it is arming activists with supporting evidence  \u2014   it found, for instance, that 98 percent of Republicans in the Senate, or 51 of the 52, had voted at one point to repeal the law. \u201cCongressional Republicans have promised an Obamacare repeal in unequivocal terms,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to keep their promise. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561937.933033}
