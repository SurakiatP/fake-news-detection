The man is a zombie, literally, watch his facial expressions.\\nI have honestly NEVER seen someone flip out like this. The first 20 seconds Gary Johnson has his neck veins inflated and all angered up, screams like a zombie, then, he admits to the reporter that he\u2019s an idiot:\\n\u201cWell I\u2019m an idiot, you know?? Really! I\u2019m the dumbest guy you ever met in your whole life!\u201d\\nPaul Lewis, the reporter looks stunned and for a while there, doesn\u2019t know how to react to his open admission of being a dumb idiot, but finally the reporter snaps out of it and says \u201cI\u2019m trying to work out if that\u2019s sarcasm.\u201d\\nGuess what Gary Johnson said\u2026 \u201cIt is\u2026 I hope it\u2019s sarcasm\u201d. So he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s really a dumb idiot or he is just being sarcastic. He hopes\u2026 then he says \u201cHow do you respond when you\u2019re being called a dummy? I\u2019m not a dummy, I\u2019m n t! And yeah I\u2019m human!\u201d Are you sure there Gary? Or you\u2019re just hoping again? Well that\u2019s it! That\u2019s how you answer when someone calls you a dummy: \u201cI\u2019m not a dummy, I\u2019m n t! And yeah I\u2019m human!\u201d Paul Lewis looks stunned as if he was expecting a more complex answer\u2026\\nThen for a few minutes or so Gary Johnson is cordial, even polite and even exposes Utah\u2019s Evan McMullin as a Hillary Clinton shill, who has recently officially endorsed Hillary Clinton and admitted that he\u2019s just a shill . Paul Lewis asked Gary why is he doing so poorly in the pools. Gary insisted that he\u2019s doing fantastic and that he is at 24% in New Mexico.\\nThe reporter then asked Gary, \u201cThen why is Evan McMullin currently tied with Clinton and Trump in Utah?\u201d Gary Johnson responded: \u201cWell he\u2019s from Utah, he\u2019s on the ballot in 11 states, so he can\u2019t win the presidency, ummm he\u2019s a Utahan. He\u2019s ensuring that Hillary Clinton will win Utah and you know what? He is what he is, and you know I hold no grudge on anyone for entering the race\u2026 Look you ask me, I\u2019m not labeling it spoiler, I\u2019m just telling you what I think the reality is.\u201d\\nThen SUDDENLY out of NOWHERE, he flips and goes ABSOLUTELY BATS#IT CRAZY AGAIN when he\u2019s asked about taxes.\\nWatch MENTALLY ILL Gary Johnson EXPLODE! But don\u2019t go, scroll down to laugh even harder!\\n\\nWe\u2019ve just discovered that taking screenshots of Gary Johnson while he\u2019s in crazy mode and at the right moment is an art! Here\u2019s a couple of perfectly timed screenshots for you: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"}, "time": 1742561779.1454318}
