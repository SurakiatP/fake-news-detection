Rand Paul ( ) told reporters Monday afternoon that former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice \u201cought to testify under oath\u201d after Bloomberg News\u2019s Eli Lake revealed that, during the presidential transition, she deliberately sought to \u201cunmask\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s associates from intelligence surveillance. [Paul called the reports that Rice made dozens of requests to learn more about the identities of anonymous people thought to be close to the Trump transition team, inadvertently caught on tape during investigations into foreign persons of intelligence interest, \u201cenormous news. \u201d  \u201cIf it is allowed, we shouldn\u2019t be allowing it. I don\u2019t think we should discount how big a deal it is that Susan rice was looking at these,\u201d Paul told the assembled reporters. The Kentucky Senator then cut to the heart of the growing political fight behind what President Trump has called \u201cwiretapping. \u201d \u201cShe needs to be asked, \u2018did President Obama ask her to do this?\u2019 I think she ought to testify under oath on this,\u201d Paul opined. Paul also tried to tie Monday\u2019s revelations about Rice to the slew of leaks on the topic around the time of the handover of the White House. \u201cI think she should be asked under oath, did she reveal it to the Washington Post?\u201d he asked.
