FBI Director James Comey announced on Friday \u2014 in a letter to high-ranking members of Congress \u2014 that the FBI is reopening the investigation on the basis of new information. \\nThe letter was addressed to Senator Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence; Senator Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman, Committee on the Judiciary; Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman, Committee on Appropriations and Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and related Agencies; Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; Representative Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; Representative Robert \u201cBob\u201d Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman, Committee on the Judiciary; Representative John Culberson (R-Texas), chairman, Committee on Appropriations and Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and related Agencies; and Representative Jayson Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. \\nComey \u2014 who declined to recommend an indictment against Clinton after the conclusion of the previous investigation in July \u2014 wrote to the chairmen of these committees to say that \u201cin connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation\u201d of Clinton. Due to this new information, Comey wrote that he believes \u201cit is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony\u201d regarding the investigation into whether Clinton knowingly broke the law. \\nComey did not say what the \u201cunrelated case\u201d is or how it is connected to Clinton\u2019s e-mails. He did say that he had been briefed about the newly discovered e-mails on Thursday and wrote, \u201cI agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\u201d CNN\u2019s Evan Perez reported that law enforcement sources say the new e-mails are not from to WikiLeaks and are not about the Clinton Foundation. \\nIn response to the letter, Representative Bob Goodlatte released a statement which said: The FBI\u2019s decision to reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton reinforces what the House Judiciary Committee has been saying for months: the more we learn about Secretary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security. Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness. The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law. \\nJason Chaffetz tweeted about the letter, saying, \u201cFBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened.\u201d \\nThe Clinton campaign claimed not to have had any previous knowledge of this most recent development. A Clinton aide reportedly told CNN, \u201cWe\u2019re learning about this just like you all are.\u201d That sounds strangely similar to President Obama\u2019s claim that he learned about Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server from news reports \u2014 a claim the White House later had to walk back. \\nCaught off guard, Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, was asked about the reopened investigation while campaigning in Tallahassee, Florida. The only response he offered to reporters was, \u201cGot to read a little more, got to read a little more.\u201d \\nDonald Trump \u2014 who told Clinton in the second presidential debate that if he is elected, he will have her investigated and that the conclusion is \u201cyou\u2019d be in jail.\u201d \u2014 seized the opportunity to make a statement before giving a prepared speech in Manchester, New Hampshire. He told the audience, \u201cThey are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d \\nComey was careful in his letter to say that \u201cthe FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant,\u201d adding that \u201cI cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work.\u201d This new phase of the investigation may \u2014 in keeping with a Clinton family tradition \u2014 continue past the election, and \u2014 if Clinton is elected \u2014 result in impeachment proceedings against her. \\nPhoto of Hillary Clinton: AP Images Please review our Comment Policy before posting a comment \\nThank you for joining the discussion at The New American.
