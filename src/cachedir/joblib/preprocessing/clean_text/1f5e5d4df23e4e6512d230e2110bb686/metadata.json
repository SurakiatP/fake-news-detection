While he has portrayed his accomplishments in the Navy in glowing terms, Mr. Zinke, a Republican and   Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of the interior, has acknowledged one \u201cglitch\u201d: that he improperly billed the government for travel to his home in Montana when he was a midlevel SEAL Team 6 officer in the late 1990s. He had to repay $211 for one of two trips, he has said, maintaining that the episode did not derail what he described as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d career. But two retired admirals under whom Mr. Zinke served say his account understates the damage that it did. Mr. Zinke was in fact punished for abusing his travel expenses, they say, through an evaluation that prevented him from rising to senior levels in the Navy. His former commanding officer in SEAL Team 6, retired Vice Adm. Albert M. Calland III, who had never before discussed the matter publicly, said in an interview that it was \u201can easy decision\u201d to hit Mr. Zinke hard over the travel claims, which came at a time when he was supposed to help prevent such abuses. \u201cI gave him a fitness report that I thought would not allow him to get to captain, and that seemed, in that regard, to work O. K.,\u201d Admiral Calland said. Even though Mr. Zinke served in a succession of No. 2 jobs in special operations after that, \u201che never got command,\u201d the admiral said. Another retired vice admiral, Sean A. Pybus, who was Mr. Zinke\u2019s boss after he left SEAL Team 6, said that Admiral Calland\u2019s decision to cite Mr. Zinke for \u201clapses in judgment\u201d in failing to set a proper example was a red flag for boards screening officers for coveted command jobs. Even if a fitness report  \u2014   essentially a performance evaluation  \u2014   gives top marks in other areas, as Mr. Zinke\u2019s did, \u201clanguage there like \u2018hey, this officer has questionable judgment,\u2019 that would keep him from being selected for a command position,\u201d Admiral Pybus said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s exactly what happened. \u201d Mr. Zinke has said he took the trips to scout training locations in Montana and nearby parts of Washington and took leave while he was there to do construction work on a family home in Whitefish, Mont. But officials who were at the command said he had less reason to scout sites at the time because he was finishing a   tour as an assault team leader. They said one of the trips also seemed suspicious because he had sought reimbursement for excess airline baggage even though he was traveling alone. Admiral Calland recalled that there was \u201ca lot of discussion\u201d among senior officers about how to punish him. It also hurt Mr. Zinke, the officials said, that the trips came when SEAL Team 6  \u2014   which, though now best known for killing Osama bin Laden, had initially been filled with   mavericks who flouted the rules  \u2014   wanted to project a more professional image to compete with the Army\u2019s Delta Force for top missions. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump said that Mr. Zinke, 55, was preparing for a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday and that neither he nor the transition team would comment for this article. Mr. Zinke\u2019s supporters say he has long since transcended the old problems through his political work and by becoming the first SEAL team member to be nominated for a cabinet position. Mr. Zinke, who was born and raised in Montana, was elected to the State Senate shortly after he retired from the Navy in 2008. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2014 and won his second term in Congress in November with 57 percent of the vote. While the main focus of the hearing is likely to be his support for increasing energy drilling and mining on public lands, and his stated view that climate change is \u201cnot proven science,\u201d senators could also question him about his Navy career. There is no doubt that Mr. Zinke was well liked and a rising star in the SEALs before the travel expenses episode. When he was a lieutenant commander in early 1998, his team snatched a Bosnian Serb war criminal, Goran Jelisic, on a city street and hustled him away in a van in a daring daytime operation. Even after Admiral Calland gave him declining performance marks in military bearing and leadership over the travel issues in   Mr. Zinke was promoted to the rank of commander, which is equivalent to lieutenant colonel in the Army, Air Force and Marines. But while he would have been eligible two or three times before he retired to be placed in charge of a unit as a commanding officer, he never was. And without serving as a commanding officer, he could not become a captain, which is equivalent to a colonel in the other services, and then an admiral, as some of his SEAL peers have. Kenneth Stethem, a retired SEAL chief petty officer who supports Mr. Zinke, said the travel issue seemed minor so many years later. \u201cWe have a saying in the teams: \u2018You never shoot a   man with a   bullet,\u2019 and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on right here,\u201d he said. But some former SEAL team members claim that Mr. Zinke has also exploited his past  \u2014   he placed the SEALs\u2019 insignia (with six stars, presumably for SEAL Team 6) on his campaign bus in violation of Defense Department guidelines against politicizing such symbols  \u2014   and that he exaggerated what he did in his later military jobs to obscure that he never received commands of his own. He published an autobiography in November that was grandly titled \u201cAmerican Commander. \u201d And his biography on his congressional website says that he was \u201cdeputy and acting commander\u201d of a task force \u201cwhere he led a force of over 3, 500 Special Operations personnel in Iraq\u201d in 2004. In an interview, Michael S. Repass, who retired from the Army as a major general and was Mr. Zinke\u2019s boss in Iraq, chuckled and said, \u201cThat might be a stretch. \u201d General Repass said that while Mr. Zinke was his deputy commander for four months, he had named him acting commander for only about a week and a half, when the general traveled to the United States. General Repass said Mr. Zinke \u201cdid a good job\u201d as his deputy and was \u201ca competent guy,\u201d and he had nominated Mr. Zinke for one of two Bronze Stars he received. Admiral Pybus said that Mr. Zinke was \u201cembarrassed and humbled\u201d when he left SEAL Team 6 and \u201cdid quite well\u201d as his deputy at a command using   SEAL units in Europe. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any fallback on poor judgment or indiscretions,\u201d Admiral Pybus said, adding that he had heard Mr. Zinke also did well in another Navy job, as the   officer (and briefly acting commander) of the main SEAL training center. Mr. Zinke attended the University of Oregon on a football scholarship and graduated in 1984 with a geology degree. He served first at a regular SEAL team and then trained other SEAL team members. Records show that two of his early bosses believed that he had the potential to become an admiral. He joined SEAL Team 6 for a stint in 1991. After working on a staff in London, Mr. Zinke returned to SEAL Team 6 in 1996 as the leader of Gold Team, one of three assault teams. Mark Cochiolo, one of the enlisted team members, said Mr. Zinke fixed \u201csome disciplinary issues\u201d and \u201cgot us refocused on what we were there for. \u201d The high mark came on Jan. 22, 1998, when members of Mr. Zinke\u2019s team jumped from unmarked vans and seized Mr. Jelisic, who had called himself the \u201cSerb Adolf,\u201d after Hitler, as he killed detainees during the Bosnian war. The operation took only a minute, former team members say, and Mr. Jelisic ended up with a   prison sentence. Admiral Calland called Mr. Zinke a \u201csuperstar\u201d in his fitness report for that year and predicted that he would \u201clead and command with distinction. \u201d But in referring to the travel problems that hurt his next evaluation, Mr. Zinke surprised some of his former teammates by suggesting in his book that he was not aware that standards had tightened. He recalled how Team 6 members had earlier \u201ctraveled and trained where they liked and Navy oversight was little or none. \u201d When he became the Gold Team leader, he maintained, \u201cthe command had changed, but I had not,\u201d attributing his travel violations to either \u201cbad judgment or a bad habit. \u201d He also minimized the effect the issue had on his career. While he wrote that it was \u201ca hard lesson to learn and likely put a cloud over me making flag officer,\u201d or admiral, he referred to the episode as just a \u201cshot across the bow. \u201d He also wrote that \u201cthe biggest penalty was being embarrassed for wrongdoing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562133.5952551}
