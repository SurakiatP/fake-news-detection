[Snowden, a former CIA employee, was granted asylum by the Russian government in 2013. He sought to escape charges of espionage, having leaked classified information concerning U. S surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA.)  However, a senior U. S official told NBC News that Russian authorities are now considering turning him over to the United States, where he would face trial, in order to \u201ccurry favor\u201d with Trump and the new administration. In December, the Russian foreign ministry revealed they had extended Snowden\u2019s permit until 2020. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper in 2015, Trump described Snowden as a \u201ctotal traitor,\u201d adding that if he became president, \u201cPutin would give him over. Snowden is a spy who should be executed. \u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m president, Putin says, hey, boom, you\u2019re gone,\u201d he continued.  \u201cA second source in the intelligence community confirms the intelligence about the Russian conversations and notes it has been gathered since the inauguration,\u201d according to NBC. CIA Director Mike Pompeo also warned last February that Snowden\u2019s return could lead to his execution, arguing that the \u201cproper outcome [of his conviction] would be that he would be given a death sentence. \u201d Lawyers for Edward Snowden dismissed the claims, saying that \u201cTeam Snowden has received no such signals and has no new reason for concern. \u201d One item that some Jewish religious leaders in the United States hope to see Putin offer is the Schneerson Collection, a library of sacred texts stolen by the Nazis and currently in the possession of the Russian government, which rabbis have tried for decades to recover. In the final week of his presidency, Barack Obama pardoned former United States soldier Chelsea Manning, who was serving 35 years in jail for leaking classified military documents to Wikileaks. Should Snowden be convicted on charges of espionage, he would face a minimum of 30 years in prison.
