[On the campaign trail,   Trump promised to rebuild American roads, bridges, airports and railways  \u2014   and in the process  \u2014   put millions of Americans back to work and grow the American economy.  In an interview given in November, just after Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton that shocked the political establishment, Steve Bannon, the President\u2019s Chief Strategist  \u2014   and one of the ideological flame keepers of Trumpism  \u2014   talked about a one trillion dollar infrastructure plan. This trillion dollar infrastructure plan would be the core of Trump\u2019s economic nationalism, and it is a plan that will not bury us further in debt with hundreds of millions in new spending but instead take advantage of   partnerships to leverage the billion dollars. As Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter, \u201cI\u2019m the guy pushing a   infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. \u201d Bannon knows that by creating jobs and rebuilding the American working class, Republicans can create something of a permanent majority in this country. \u201cThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia  \u2026     If we deliver  \u2026     we\u2019ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we\u2019ll govern for 50 years. That\u2019s what the Democrats missed. They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It\u2019s not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about. \u201d Bannon is absolutely right. We can rebuild the American working class.  If successful in that endeavor, we can build a political majority for decades and we can do so without bankrupting future generations with new taxpayer spending. One of President Trump\u2019s favorite example is airport infrastructure needs. On the campaign trail, candidate Trump frequently bemoaned the state of U. S. airports  \u2014   particularly as opposed to some of our international neighbors. President Trump has promised to build great 21st century airports. The problem, of course, is that a recent study shows that American airports currently have $100 billion in unmet infrastructure needs. The good news is that those needs can be met exactly as Bannon and the Trump campaign envisioned. Conservative Congressman Thomas Massie ( ) has   legislation with Rep. Pete DeFazio ( ) that would remove the arbitrary federal cap on the passenger facility charge (PFC)  \u2014   allowing individual airports to set their own PFC without federal involvement. By allowing airports to raise the funds locally from the passengers who actually use the airports  \u2014   rather than federal taxpayers  \u2014   the   bill would allow airports to make critical investments in infrastructure. This move would not only allow us to rebuild our airports  \u2014   without spending a dime of federal taxpayer dollars  \u2014   it would also return control to the individual local airports and away from Washington, DC. This is why so many conservative and libertarian organizations like the Competitive Enterprise Institute, FreedomWorks and Citizens Against Government Waste have explicitly endorsed the effort. Bannon can mark another promise made as a promise kept from his infamous White House white board if the Trump administration joins with other conservatives in supporting the   effort to get the federal government out of the airport business.'"}, "time": 1742562730.7467642}
