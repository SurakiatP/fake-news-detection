One wonders if they have read the book. [The regime in George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d declared \u201cWar is Peace  \u2014   Freedom is Slavery  \u2014   Ignorance is Strength. \u201d The dystopian fiction drew flocks of book buyers after Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway\u2019s comment about \u201calternative facts. \u201d  \u2014   Los Angeles Times, Jan. 25, 2017, Orwell\u2019s novel is an attack on socialism, and particularly on the media\u2019s role in an imagined socialist state.  The lead character, Winston Smith, is a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Truth whose role it is to rewrite history to suit the political preferences of the Party, and to destroy historical evidence that contradicts the official narrative. (It is a state, interestingly, that suppresses gender roles to control sex. Only in a forbidden, and subversively traditional, sexual liaison does Smith briefly find refuge.) One hopes, therefore, that the people rushing to buy Nineteen   because they see it as some kind of talking point against the Trump administration will actually read the novel. Perhaps they will be shocked by the parallels between the Two Minutes Hate  \u2014   an organized demonstration of outrage against a largely imagined adversary  \u2014   and the unhinged   protests last weekend. Perhaps they will be alarmed at the degree to which our media also serve a \u201cParty\u201d  \u2014   voluntarily. More likely, however, their new copies of Nineteen   will sit on their relatively empty bookshelves, right next to the U. S. Constitutions they bought after Khizr Khan waved his copy from the podium at the Democratic National Convention. Nothing in the Constitution prevents the U. S. from excluding aliens on the basis of objectionable religious or political beliefs  \u2014   indeed, we do it already and have done it for decades  \u2014   but you have to read the thing to know that, and few apparently did. The \u201chook\u201d on which the supposed Orwellian analogy hangs is \u201cKellyanne Conway\u2019s comment [to NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd] about \u2018alternative facts. \u2019\u201d The phrase has been distorted to mean the opposite of what Conway intended. In any legal dispute, opposing sides will present the court with alternative versions of the facts in the case. That is clearly what Conway meant. But the media, and the left, spun \u201calternative facts\u201d as if she meant \u201calternatives to fact,\u201d i. e. deliberate lies, reckless disregard of the truth. Recall that NBC  \u2014   the network on which Conway appeared  \u2014   was the network that selectively edited the audio of the 911 call by George Zimmerman to police in February 2012 to make it appear that Zimmerman had targeted Trayvon Martin because of his race. That deliberate lie put Zimmerman\u2019s liberty at risk and inflamed race relations nationwide. More recently, it was Todd himself who declared in October  \u2014   citing Republicans, but clearly in agreement  \u2014   that the presidential race was \u201cover. \u201d It is true that Trump is prone to exaggeration. It is also true that there is usually some basis for his claims. Recall the furore over his claim that \u201cthousands\u201d of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the   terror attacks. The media treated the claim as if Trump had simply made it up. But it turned out to be based on a kernel of truth: there had, in fact, been some limited   celebrations. And Trump correctly recalled that there had been a local news report that had shaped his impression of events. Likewise with the crowd size at the inauguration. From the steps of the Capitol, and even near the front of the ceremony, it would have been nearly impossible to see any gaps in the crowd. A   photograph by CNN confirms that fact. And yet the gaps did exist: Trump\u2019s crowd on the Mall was almost certainly not as large as Obama\u2019s in 2009. But that cannot, and does not, negate the administration\u2019s claim that more people watched overall, through electronic media. Both can be true. Sometimes you need the \u201calternative facts\u201d  \u2014   what journalists used to call \u201cboth sides of the story\u201d  \u2014   to paint the full picture. But the mainstream media presume that the Trump administration doesn\u2019t have a side  \u2014   nor do Trump\u2019s voters and supporters. Instead, the mainstream media have taken the other side. They dress it up in platitudes about holding the new administration accountable  \u2014   as if, just like Nineteen   the past eight years of servility can be shoved down the \u201cMemory Hole. \u201d While the mainstream media were nitpicking over crowd size, and fabricating stories like the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. bust, Breitbart News  \u2014   falsely impugned as Trump\u2019s \u201cPravda\u201d  \u2014   was taking the administration to task over its failure to address the immigration issue on day one. Earlier, Breitbart reported Trump\u2019s broken promise to pursue Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal. The truth is that the mainstream media, collectively, are Big Brother.
