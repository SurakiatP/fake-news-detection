If received on his BlackBerry, the \u201cwhitelisting\u201d safeguard means Clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission \u2013 covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls. The Obama BlackBerry would have also been configured to accept the communications. \\n\u201cThink of whitelisting like a bouncer in the VIP line at the party. If you are on the list you get in, if you are not, you get bounced to the pavement,\u201d said Bob Gourley, former chief technology officer (CTO) for the DIA, and now a partner with strategic consulting and engineering firm Cognitio.\""}, "time": 1742563578.00457}
