[During his Thursday night monologue on CBS\u2019 Late Show, Colbert  \u2014   whose use of a slur to describe the president earlier this week has apparently already been forgotten  \u2014   railed against the bill, which is meant as a GOP alternative to former President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.  \u201cThe new bill would cut taxes for the wealthy up to $883 billion,\u201d Colbert said during his nearly   monologue. \u201cNow listen, if hearing that raises your blood pressure, calm down. You can\u2019t afford the medication anymore. \u201d Colbert went on to skewer White House chief of staff Reince Priebus for a quote in which he said \u201cthe president stepped up and helped us punt the ball into the end zone. \u201d (The Hill journalist Molly Hooper later said she misquoted Priebus, and that he had said \u201cpunch\u201d instead of \u201cpunt\u201d). \u201cYes, a punt into the end zone,\u201d Colbert repeated, quoting what Priebus did not say. \u201cAccurate because it gives you zero points and gives your opponent good field position. \u201d \u201cI think a more accurate football metaphor might have been, the GOP just kicked America in the balls,\u201d he added. Colbert sparked a social media campaign to get him fired from CBS this week after referring to President Donald Trump\u2019s mouth as \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s c*ck holster\u201d during his Monday Late Show monologue. The host addressed the controversy during his Wednesday show, but stopped short of offering an apology. \u201cI don\u2019t regret that. He, I believe, can take care of himself. I have jokes, he has the launch codes. So, it\u2019s a fair fight,\u201d Colbert said Wednesday. \u201cSo while I would do it again, I would change a few words that were cruder than they needed to be. \u201d   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742562068.7509713}
