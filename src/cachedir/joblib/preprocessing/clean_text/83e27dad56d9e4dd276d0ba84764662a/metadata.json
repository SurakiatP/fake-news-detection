Bolt and the Jamaican team have been stripped of their   relay gold medal from the Beijing Games in 2008 because one runner, Nesta Carter, was found guilty of a doping violation, the International Olympic Committee said on Wednesday. Bolt won the 100 meters, the 200 and the 4x100 relay at the last three Summer Olympics, for a total of nine gold medals, tied for the most of any track athlete. Carter initially tested negative after the race in 2008. But his sample was one of many retested by the I. O. C. last year. It was found to contain a prohibited stimulant, methylhexaneamine. Carter\u2019s lawyer told Reuters on Wednesday that he intended to file an appeal of the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Olympic officials last year intensified scrutiny of samples from past Olympics after Russia was found to have executed an elaborate,   doping scheme. Dozens of athletes from the Beijing and London Games have been found, upon retesting of their stored samples, to be guilty of doping violations. Many were medalists. It is standard practice for Olympic officials to store urine samples for up to a decade so they may conduct additional tests, often with more advanced, newly developed techniques. Carter was also a part of the winning 4x100 relay team in London in 2012, but no announcement about the status of that medal has been made. The I. O. C. directed the international track federation to \u201cmodify the results\u201d of the 2008 event. Trinidad, Japan and Brazil were second, third and fourth in the race and would each move up a notch. The United States dropped the baton in its heat and did not make the final. The I. O. C. also told the Jamaican federation to secure the return of the physical gold medals. The other two team members in the final were Asafa Powell and Michael Frater. The Jamaican team finished in 37. 10 seconds, which was a world record at the time. When one member of a team tests positive, it is typical for the entire team to be stripped of its medals, although there have been exceptions. Marion Jones lost two relay medals from 2000 after doping violations, but her teammates were allowed to keep theirs after an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. When news of Carter\u2019s positive test first emerged last year, Bolt told The Guardian, \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because over the years you\u2019ve worked hard to accumulate gold medals and work hard to be a champion  \u2014   but it\u2019s just one of those things. \u201d He added, \u201cIf I need to give back my gold medal, I\u2019d have to give it back it\u2019s not a problem for me. \u201d The I. O. C. also announced on Wednesday that Tatiana Lebedeva of Russia was disqualified from the 2008 long jump, in which she won the silver medal, and the triple jump because of a positive test. Bolt, regarded as the greatest sprinter in history, has said he will retire from the sport after this summer\u2019s world championships in London.'"}, "time": 1742564164.0256867}
