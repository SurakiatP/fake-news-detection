Here is the full list: PUBLIC SERVICE ProPublica and The Daily News The series by The Daily News and ProPublica exposed the widespread abuse by the New York Police Department of a   law to bar hundreds of people from their homes and businesses over alleged criminal activity. The investigation, which was led by Sarah Ryley, 36, a journalist for The Daily News, found that the Police Department almost exclusively targeted households and shops in minority neighborhoods. The reporting spurred New York City to pass sweeping reforms. __________ BREAKING NEWS REPORTING The East Bay Times Dozens of journalists at The East Bay Times worked on the coverage of the deadly \u201cGhost Ship\u201d fire in Oakland, Calif. in December, which killed 36 people at a warehouse party. \u201cWe had everybody involved, from investigative reporters to artists to breaking news reporters,\u201d said Neil Chase, the paper\u2019s executive editor. Mr. Chase said the paper, whose reporting also revealed the city\u2019s shortcomings in preventing the tragedy, was donating the cash prize that comes with the award to a local fund for the victims. __________ INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING Eric Eyre, The Charleston   Mr. Eyre (pronounced AIR) 51, won the award for a series of articles about the opioid abuse epidemic in West Virginia. Mr. Eyre, the paper\u2019s statehouse reporter, began his multipart series with these words: \u201cFollow the pills and you\u2019ll find the overdose deaths. \u201d It took Mr. Eyre years to acquire the documents most important to his reporting, and he did it \u201cin the face of powerful opposition,\u201d according to the Pulitzer citation. A lawyer defending a drug wholesale company said that it was vital to protect crucial court records \u201cfrom the intrusive journalistic nose of the  . \u201d __________ EXPLANATORY REPORTING The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, McClatchy and The Miami Herald A sprawling network of journalists was awarded the prize for their explosive articles on the   Panama Papers. The Pulitzer board commended the \u201ccollaboration of more than 300 reporters on six continents to expose the hidden infrastructure and global scale of offshore tax havens. \u201d The work was originally submitted for the international reporting award, but the board moved it to the explanatory reporting category. __________ LOCAL REPORTING The staff of The Salt Lake Tribune The prize honored reports about \u201cthe perverse, punitive and cruel treatment given to sexual assault victims at Brigham Young University. \u201d The Tribune\u2019s first article said that the university, owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, investigated students who reported sex crimes  \u2014   and sometimes disciplined them for breaking rules on curfews and dress codes. The Tribune also found that the school\u2019s Title IX office, to which students could report sexual assaults, regularly alerted the honor code office, which looked into the rule violations. In November, Brigham Young took steps to restructure the Title IX office. The school also said that students who reported sexual assaults would no longer risk having their conduct reviewed by the honor code office. __________ NATIONAL REPORTING David A. Fahrenthold, The Washington Post Mr. Fahrenthold was cited for his reporting during the 2016 presidential campaign, which cast doubt on Donald J. Trump\u2019s \u201cassertions of generosity toward charities. \u201d A month after Mr. Trump skipped a Republican debate in Iowa to attend a   for veterans, Mr. Fahrenthold found that only about half of the money had gone to veterans\u2019 charities. Mr. Fahrenthold, 39, later found that Mr. Trump had used his own foundation\u2019s money for   legal settlements and purchases that included two portraits of himself. In October, Mr. Fahrenthold received a tip about a video that showed Mr. Trump talking about women in vulgar terms. \u201cThe voice you\u2019d heard in so many other contexts was talking in a way we\u2019d never heard before,\u201d Mr. Fahrenthold said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s what made it so powerful. \u201d __________ INTERNATIONAL REPORTING The staff of The New York Times In \u201cRussia\u2019s Dark Arts,\u201d a team of New York Times journalists across two continents chronicled the covert and sometimes deadly actions taken by President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government to grow Russian influence abroad. The series, which began last spring, explored the rise of online \u201ctroll armies,\u201d the strategic spreading of disinformation and Russia\u2019s unprecedented  \u2014   and politically consequential  \u2014   cyberattack on the 2016 American presidential election. __________ FEATURE WRITING C. J. Chivers, The New York Times Mr. Chivers, 52, spent months crafting his   portrait of a young combat veteran haunted by his experiences in Afghanistan, who was imprisoned after a violent fight with a stranger. Unflinching yet empathetic, the reporting by Mr. Chivers  \u2014   himself a former Marine  \u2014   prompted the state of Illinois to vacate the veteran\u2019s jail sentence. \u201cThe truth literally set a young man free,\u201d Jake Silverstein, the editor of The New York Times Magazine, where the story appeared, said Monday. __________ COMMENTARY Peggy Noonan, The Wall Street Journal Ms. Noonan, 66, has been a longtime observer and participant in the political sphere, having worked as a speechwriter to President Ronald Reagan. Her winning columns addressed the bruising 2016 campaign season and the rise of Mr. Trump, analyzing his populist appeal and his effect on the Republican Party. Paul Gigot, the editor of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page, wrote in a memo to the newsroom, \u201cPeggy didn\u2019t shrink from addressing Trump\u2019s many flaws as a candidate, but she always showed great respect for the intelligence of voters and explained the currents of American life and politics that catapulted Trump to the White House. \u201d __________ CRITICISM Hilton Als, The New Yorker A staff writer at The New Yorker since 1994, Mr. Als, 56, was praised for reviews that \u201cstrove to put stage dramas within a   cultural context,\u201d particularly when it comes to themes of gender, sexuality and race. Mr. Als, who was a finalist last year, is known for stylish and trenchant prose, and won the honor for a set of 10 pieces that covered works including \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and \u201cDear Evan Hansen. \u201d American theater, he said in an interview, is an a transitional state. \u201cWe\u2019re living in an amazing age,\u201d he said. \u201cAll kinds of stories are going to be told now that just didn\u2019t get an audience before. That\u2019s thrilling to me. \u201d __________ EDITORIAL WRITING Art Cullen, The Storm Lake Times There is no mistaking the anger in the voice of The Storm Lake Times when it writes about the legacy of big agriculture: \u201cAnyone with eyes and a nose knows in his gut that Iowa has the dirtiest surface water in America. \u201d That voice is personal, too. It belongs to Mr. Cullen, 59, who owns the newspaper with his brother John. The Times comes out twice a week and has a circulation of 3, 000. Among its admiring readers were Pulitzer jurors. They cited Mr. Cullen\u2019s \u201ctenacious reporting, impressive expertise and engaging writing. \u201d __________ EDITORIAL CARTOONING Jim Morin, The Miami Herald The looming ogre of \u201cNationalism,\u201d armed with a malevolent grin and the club of \u201cRacism,\u201d opened the door and cast his menacing shadow last June. \u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember me?\u201d For this and other work portraying a frightening America, Mr. Morin, 64, earned his second Pulitzer Prize. (The first was in 1996.) The Pulitzer jurors said he \u201cdelivered sharp perspectives through flawless artistry, biting prose and crisp wit. \u201d __________ BREAKING NEWS PHOTOGRAPHY Daniel Berehulak, The New York Times Mr. Berehulak, 41, was recognized for work that showed \u201cthe callous disregard for human life in the Philippines brought about by a government assault on drug dealers and users. \u201d On Monday, Mr. Berehulak described observing \u201can assembly line of   murder\u201d over 35 days in Manila. He dedicated his award to the families of those killed, saying he hoped \u201ctheir pain might somehow be remedied by justice. \u201d He was previously awarded a Pulitzer Prize for feature photography in 2015 for his work documenting the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. __________ FEATURE PHOTOGRAPHY E. Jason Wambsgans, The Chicago Tribune Mr. Wambsgans, 44, was honored for his portrayal of a    boy and his mother after the boy survived a shooting in Chicago. He has mainly photographed violence in the city for the past four years. \u201cBecause he and his mother were so open, it was just a deeper level of intimacy than we\u2019re typically able to convey,\u201d Mr. Wambsgans said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a bittersweet thing because there\u2019s not a week that goes by that I don\u2019t worry about this boy and his future. \u201d __________ FICTION Colson Whitehead, \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d When he was working on his hallucinatory and chilling novel, which reimagines American slavery, Mr. Whitehead studied works by masters of magical realism, including Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved\u201d and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude. \u201d His aim was to write about \u201cthe fantastic with a straight face. \u201d Mr. Whitehead, 47, said the critical reactions to the book have been enormously gratifying (the novel also won the National Book Award). But one of the most meaningful responses came from a stranger who approached him in a bookstore. \u201cShe said, \u2018Your book made me a more empathetic person,\u2019\u201d he said. __________ DRAMA Lynn Nottage, \u201cSweat\u201d Ms. Nottage\u2019s play explores   alienation in Reading, Pa. a city that has been hurt by deindustrialization. The Pulitzer citation called \u201cSweat,\u201d which is currently running on Broadway, \u201ca nuanced yet powerful drama that reminds audiences of the stacked deck still facing workers searching for the American dream. \u201d \u201cI was trying to understand how economic stagnation is reshaping our cultural narrative,\u201d Ms. Nottage said, \u201cand wanting to tell the story of what was happening to people on the ground in a way that was truthful and emotional and unapologetic. \u201d This is the second Pulitzer Prize for Ms. Nottage, 52, who won in 2009 for \u201cRuined,\u201d a play about rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo. __________ HISTORY Heather Ann Thompson, \u201cBlood in the Water\u201d Ms. Thompson spent 13 years researching this account of the Attica prison uprising, which the Pulitzer board cited as \u201ca narrative history that sets high standards for scholarly judgment and tenacity of inquiry. \u201d In addition to extensive archival research, Ms. Thompson, 53, interviewed dozens of survivors, participants and observers, many of whom spent decades fighting to uncover the truth about the violent retaking that left 39 prisoners and hostages dead. \u201cThis was a story that the people inside of that prison have been trying to tell for 45 years,\u201d she said. __________ BIOGRAPHY Hisham Matar, \u201cThe Return: Fathers, Sons and the Land in Between\u201d Mr. Matar was a    student in England when his father, a prominent critic of the government of Col. Muammar   living in exile, was kidnapped and taken to a secret prison in Libya. This memoir recounts Mr. Matar\u2019s return to his homeland 22 years later, after the fall of that government, to find out what happened to him. The Pulitzer citation called it \u201ca   elegy for home and father,\u201d executed with \u201ccontrolled emotion. \u201d In an interview last year with The New York Times, Mr. Matar, 46, was asked to imagine what his father would have made of his journey. \u201cMy failure to cure myself of Libya would have amused and perhaps even comforted him,\u201d Mr. Matar said. \u201cMy search for him would have not. He wanted me, above all things, to be free and happy. \u201d __________ POETRY Tyehimba Jess, \u201cOlio\u201d Mr. Jess\u2019s second book of poems is a kaleidoscopic and formally ambitious collection about   artists between the Civil War and World War I, and the ways in which they both fought against and tried to make creative use of the cultural pressures of minstrelsy. Scott Joplin plays a prominent role in the book\u2019s imagination, as do less   figures, most but not all musicians. \u201cAmerican music is critically and fundamentally tied to the   experience, the experience of a people who were denied access to literacy for most of our time in this country through slavery,\u201d Mr. Jess, 51, said in an interview in March with The New School. \u201cThey were forced to forge another kind of literacy through the music. \u201d __________ GENERAL NONFICTION Matthew Desmond, \u201cEvicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City\u201d In his meticulously reported book, Mr. Desmond, a sociologist, followed eight impoverished families in Milwaukee as they struggled to make rent. Mr. Desmond, 37, a director of the Justice and Poverty Project at Harvard, said he decided to investigate the causes and the repercussions of evictions as a way to write about the systemic causes of poverty in the United States. \u201cAmerica\u2019s the richest country, with the worst poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cThat ugly fact has troubled me for a long time, and I wanted to understand the role that housing plays. \u201d __________ MUSIC Du Yun, \u201cAngel\u2019s Bone\u201d  Ms. Du, 39, won for her savage chamber opera, a collaboration with the librettist Royce Vavrek, which finds an allegory for human trafficking in the story of two angels who are brutally mistreated after they   in a suburban backyard. \u201cIn the U. S. trafficking seems very far from us, in Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s happening right in front of our eyes. And that\u2019s how this arose, to be able to create a platform that\u2019s not didactic, but a work that allows ideas to blossom. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563290.2699294}
