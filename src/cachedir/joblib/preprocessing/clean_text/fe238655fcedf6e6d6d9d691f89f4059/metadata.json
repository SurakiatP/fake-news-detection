But the opposite has happened with Pok\u00e9mon Go, a free smartphone game that has soared to the top of the download charts: It has sent people into streets and parks, onto beaches and even out to sea in a kayak in the week since it was released. The game  \u2014   in which players try to capture exotic monsters from Pok\u00e9mon, the Japanese cartoon franchise  \u2014   uses a combination of ordinary technologies built into smartphones, including location tracking and cameras, to encourage people to visit public landmarks, seeking virtual loot and collectible characters that they try to nab. Boon Sheridan, a resident of Holyoke, Mass. has seen the activity firsthand. His home, a converted   church that once attracted worshipers, had without his knowledge been designated a Pok\u00e9mon \u201cgym,\u201d a place where players who reach Level 5 in the game must go to train their Pok\u00e9mon characters. In the last week, as the game became the most downloaded and top grossing app, he has been wondering how to explain to neighbors all the people who congregated on the sidewalk and pulled up at odd hours. \u201cI want to make sure I tell them, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not a drug dealer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cI know there are people pulling up in front of the house all the time, but trust me I have no say in this. \u201d On Sunday, San Francisco\u2019s parks and downtown were crawling with Pok\u00e9mon Go players while in Washington, the White House and the Pentagon have been designated official Pok\u00e9mon gyms. A bar in Harrisonburg, Va. was offering a 10 percent discount to Pok\u00e9mon Go players on a specific team, while a tea shop in Japantown in San Francisco offered a \u201cbuy one tea, get one free\u201d deal to Pok\u00e9mon Go players. The number of daily active users on Android devices in the United States alone was closing in on the usage of Twitter, the data analytics firm SimilarWeb estimated. Pok\u00e9mon Go represents one of those moments when a new technology  \u2014   in this case, augmented reality or A. R. which fuses digital technology with the physical world  \u2014   breaks through from a niche toy for early adopters to something much bigger. The idea behind the technology is to overlay digital imagery on a person\u2019s view of the real world, using a smartphone screen or a headset. In the case of Pok\u00e9mon Go, players traverse the physical world following a digital map, searching for cartoon creatures that surface at random. People look through their smartphone cameras to find Pok\u00e9mon. When an animated creature appears, they toss Pok\u00e9balls at it until it is subdued. But Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s public nature is also causing unforeseen side effects, attracting crowds that disturb homeowners and creating opportunities for criminals to lure players to remote areas where they can be targeted for theft. In Australia, police have issued tips for how roving Pok\u00e9mon Go players can safely play the game. Many technology companies thought A. R. might first take off through specialized business applications that, for example, allow architects to visualize finished building projects in situ. Instead, it took a game based on a beloved entertainment franchise from the   in Japan to help the technology go mainstream. Pok\u00e9mon, a hybrid of the words \u201cpocket\u201d and \u201cmonsters,\u201d belongs to the Pok\u00e9mon Company, which is partly owned by Nintendo, the Japanese game pioneer, which has struggled to adapt to the era of gaming on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. In the cartoon, Pok\u00e9mon trainers use characters to battle each other for sport. The uptake of Pok\u00e9mon Go, which is so far available only in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, has been so furious that it sent Nintendo\u2019s market capitalization soaring $9 billion in the last few days. Pok\u00e9mon Go, though, is actually the work of a   Niantic Inc. which was created inside Google and spun out of the company last year. Niantic\u2019s first game, a   conspiracy thriller called Ingress, was made possible by Google\u2019s digital mapping service. About 15 million users have downloaded Ingress, and there are a little over one million active players a month, said John Hanke, Niantic\u2019s chief executive. Niantic partnered with the Pok\u00e9mon Company to make Pok\u00e9mon Go. Mr. Hanke said he didn\u2019t have exact numbers of Pok\u00e9mon Go players, but that it was safe to say it will be \u201cquite a bit beyond\u201d the number of players Ingress has attracted. Downloads of Pok\u00e9mon Go have been so frequent that Niantic\u2019s servers had trouble handling the traffic and the company is struggling to add additional capacity. Mr. Hanke said Niantic was delaying the game\u2019s introduction in additional countries for a few days so it could handle the demand. \u201cWe expected it to be popular, but we didn\u2019t expect it to be like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting our feet underneath us. \u201d Like the most successful mobile games, while Pok\u00e9mon Go is free to play, it gives players opportunities to buy virtual items for a few dollars to speed up their progress. The game\u2019s   nature also gives Niantic another intriguing moneymaking possibility, by charging   restaurants, coffee shops and other retail establishments to become sponsored locations where people are motivated to go to pick up virtual loot. Niantic has cut deals like that for Ingress, and Mr. Hanke said the company would announce sponsored locations for Pok\u00e9mon Go in the future. Nintendo referred questions to a Pok\u00e9mon Company representative, who declined to comment on Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s popularity. Jan Dawson, a technology analyst at Jackdaw Research, said Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s success was an important moment for augmented reality, mainly because it doesn\u2019t require expensive extra equipment like a headset, which virtual reality games often need. \u201cThis clearly demonstrates that A. R. can cross over into the mainstream on the devices people already have in at least some cases,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t necessarily do anything for the kind of A. R. and V. R. experiences big companies are piling so much money into. \u201d For players, Pok\u00e9mon Go has been a health booster and a social cementer. Kay Collins, a    health care worker in San Francisco, played the game for half a day straight on Sunday, including while waiting in line at a tattoo parlor. \u201cMy pedometer says I\u2019ve taken way, way more steps throughout the day than I used to before I started playing this game,\u201d she said, adding that it had helped her explore her neighborhood. Brad Ensworth, a San Francisco State University student who played the game over the weekend, said he had never been a fan of augmented reality gaming before Pok\u00e9mon Go, but was drawn in by the game\u2019s surprisingly social aspect. \u201cYou\u2019ll just run into people and spark up conversations immediately,\u201d he said while playing the game in Golden Gate Park. \u201cWe met this one guy who drove up from San Jose to collect Pok\u00e9mon in the park, and he had more knowledge about this game than anyone else we\u2019ve met so far. We called him the Guru. \u201d Pok\u00e9mon Go mass gatherings are also on the horizon. Sara Witsch, a theater studies major at San Francisco State University, organized a Facebook group for a \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go crawl\u201d that is tentatively scheduled for July 20. As of Monday evening, more than 18, 000 people had indicated they were interested in attending, and more than 3, 700 confirmed that they would be there.'"}, "time": 1742562879.8970537}
