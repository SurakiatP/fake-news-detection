{"duration": 0.24093055725097656, "input_args": {"text": "'This year\u2019s holiday advertising campaign for the United States Postal Service featured a little girl\u2019s stunningly infectious musical plea: \u201cI Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas. \u201d (And, as she explains, \u201cOnly a hippopotamus will do. \u201d) The ditty was, perhaps, unfamiliar to many listeners, but it penetrated the mind space of the unwary at warp speed  \u2014   and stayed there. Resistance was futile. Unexpectedly, the song has also upended the quiet retirement of Gayla Peevey, 73, a former child star who recorded the novelty hit in 1953. At the time, the song landed her on the Ed Sullivan show \u201cToast of the Town. \u201d Since November, television viewers have been able to enjoy (and enjoy) that same recording in the omnipresent post office commercial. \u201cThe song could drive you crazy,\u201d Ms. Peevey conceded. But it doesn\u2019t drive her crazy  \u2014   not at all. \u201cI love hearing it, and I can\u2019t hear it too much,\u201d she said recently by telephone. Before all the recent hippo hoopla, Ms. Peevey, the former owner of a boutique advertising agency in El Cajon, Calif. had spent her days immersed in good works:   for nonprofits and serving on the board of one of them singing in her church choir leading a Bible study group for women. She and her husband of 53 years, Cliff Henderson, a retired elementary school teacher, frequently drive to Los Angeles from their home in La Mesa to visit their daughter,    and three grandchildren. There are   trips to Hawaii with three other couples, weekly taco nights with those travel companions and \u201cdate day\u201d every Friday with Cliff. A full and active life, yes. But a few years ago, Ms. Peevey  \u2014   generally a sunny soul  \u2014   was starting to feel a little down. \u201cI saw other people retiring from these big careers, and I started to wonder, \u2018What have I really accomplished in life? \u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI really prayed about it. And I think God decided to throw some blessings on me. \u201d Ms. Peevey was aware, of course, that the Lord works in mysterious ways, so she\u2019s not at all certain how her childhood recording was rediscovered. Satellite radio, she speculated, or perhaps the internet. But here\u2019s what she knows for sure: \u201cI Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas\u201d  \u2014   which peaked 63 years ago at No. 24 on the Billboard chart  \u2014   has become a viral sensation. (A    video of Ms. Peevey\u2019s \u201cToast of the Town\u201d appearance  \u2014   she\u2019s in a party frock and hair ribbon and halts a game of jacks with her playmates to belt out her singular wish  \u2014   has had more than four million views on YouTube recent comments include, \u201cThis song is stuck in my head. \u201d) But the people at the Postal Service were not the first to harness the power of the song. In 2008, Hallmark came out with a   tree ornament that plays the earworm of a tune, written by the songwriter John Rox. (His other hit was \u201cIt\u2019s a Big, Wide Wonderful World,\u201d recorded in 1949 by Buddy Clark.) Hallmark has brought the ornament back four more times, including during the 2016 holiday season. Look for it again next year. Gretchen Wilson, a country music singer, recorded the song on a Christmas album that was released in 2009. LeAnn Rimes, another country singer, followed suit in 2014, but said she could never hope to equal Ms. Peevey\u2019s inimitable sound. Thanks to the resurgence in the song\u2019s popularity, Ms. Peevey  \u2014   who goes by the surname Henderson except for   matters  \u2014   has been deluged with calls and emails from newspapers, television stations and fans all over the world. Royalty checks in amounts ranging from a few hundred dollars to $1, 000 have been rolling in  \u2014   more about this in a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s like a whole new world,\u201d she said. Actually, it\u2019s something of a return to the world Ms. Peevey inhabited as a cute, blond    from Oklahoma City. After her record took off, going out in public became an impossibility. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d she remembered. \u201cPeople were looking and pointing. I got mobbed everywhere I went. \u201d Ms. Peevey said she started singing \u201cpractically out of the womb. \u201d \u201cI can\u2019t remember when I didn\u2019t sing,\u201d she continued. \u201cI really can\u2019t. \u201d From an early age, she was a mainstay of the church choir in Ponca City, Okla. where her family moved in 1948. There she put on backyard shows for the neighbors and sang at community events. Her robust voice with its country sheen was a force of nature. An uncle who played fiddle on a radio show broadcast from Oklahoma City arranged a guest spot for Gayla when she was 8 it led first to a   gig on   (now KFOR) the local NBC affiliate, then to a regular spot on \u201cSaturday Night Revue,\u201d an NBC variety show that was a summer replacement for \u201cYour Show of Shows. \u201d Hoagy Carmichael was the host. \u201cI sang duets with him,\u201d Ms. Peevey recalled. \u201cThere was one of his songs, \u2018Two Sleepy People,\u2019 and I sang harmony  \u2014   it was very fun. \u201d Guest stars included Jimmy Durante and Dean Martin, with whom Ms. Peevey performed during her first appearance on the program. And every week the show booked a different big orchestra, \u201cso I got to sing with Les Brown and Jerry Fielding and David Rose,\u201d she said. \u201cPlucked out of local television  \u2014   it was a big jump. But they were so nice to me because I was a kid. \u201d Then came the contract from Columbia Records. The very first song that Mitch Miller, then a Columbia executive, brought to Ms. Peevey was \u201cI Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas. \u201d She recorded it in New York with Mr. Miller playing the oboe and leading the orchestra. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to sing it that many times,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI would say the third time was the take. \u201d She introduced the song on \u201cToast of the Town,\u201d though not without considerable drama beforehand: Her manager canceled an exclusive contract with NBC so that she could appear on the rival network CBS, home of Mr. Sullivan\u2019s show  \u2014   \u201cand I didn\u2019t get another NBC contract after that,\u201d Ms. Peevey said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the manager made the best decision, but everybody watched Ed Sullivan,\u201d she said. \u201cThe record took off and was a big hit. \u201d In a   media event at the end of 1953, a real, live hippopotamus from the Central Park Zoo was shipped to Oklahoma City as a Christmas present for young Gayla she donated it to her local zoo. At the time, Ms. Peevey said, \u201cthere was talk that my career was going to be huge. \u201d But things didn\u2019t turn out that way, and the producers at Columbia Records may have been part of the problem. \u201cAfter the hippo song, they thought, \u2018Well, that was a big hit,\u2019 so every song they gave me after that was an animal song and they were not good songs, let me tell you,\u201d Ms. Peevey said. She was occasionally teamed with a fellow child star, Jimmy Boyd, singer of the   \u201cI Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus. \u201d \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t know that they could speak up and say, \u2018Is this really the best song? \u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cIn Oklahoma, I was used to singing \u2018Your Cheatin\u2019 Heart\u2019 and \u2018Walkin\u2019 My Baby Back Home\u2019 and all of those adult songs that I could really sink my teeth into. \u201d Ms. Peevey\u2019s father, Lewin, a tax collector, and her mother, Irene, a homemaker, were the antithesis of stage parents, not particularly keen on show business and uncertain about how to deal with Gayla\u2019s sudden fame. \u201cThey decided that they wanted to take me out of show business so I could have a normal life,\u201d she said. \u201cThey pulled the plug, and I was a kid so I didn\u2019t have any say. \u201d But Ms. Peevey said she was \u201ckind of happy\u201d to get away from all the hubbub. Part of pulling the plug involved a move to Southern California, where she was just another student at the local junior high school. \u201cWhat a shock it was,\u201d Ms. Peevey remembered. \u201cNobody knew who I was, and I realized I was lacking some basic social skills that I hadn\u2019t had to develop. \u201d \u201cI was so used to everybody clamoring for me and coming to me,\u201d she explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of experience in reaching out and being a friend. I had a big learning curve in that regard. \u201d But that was not the only adjustment. To retire as a child star packs a particularly unpleasant wallop. \u201cYou have this sort of feeling that you\u2019re a   at 12,\u201d Ms. Peevey said. \u201cThat was the thing I had to deal with  \u2014   that I had already peaked. \u201d She had a bit of a comeback at 16 when \u201cMy Little Marine,\u201d a song she wrote and recorded under the name Jamie Horton, made it into the top 100 on Billboard. Another tune, \u201cRobot Man,\u201d \u201cdid pretty well, but nothing took off as it did when I was a child,\u201d Ms. Peevey said. \u201cI can see where child stars get into trouble as far as not being able to negotiate the transition to adult performer, and it can be very devastating if you\u2019re not grounded. \u201d After getting a degree in elementary education, she briefly taught school in San Diego. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d Ms. Peevey said. Instead, she opened a small advertising business while raising her daughter, Sydney, who inherited Mom\u2019s musical chops. It was Sydney who did a little research three years ago and learned that Ms. Peevey had an account at Sony Music, now the parent company of Columbia. \u201cThey were holding funds of just under a hundred grand that had been adding up since 2008,\u201d Ms. Peevey said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s pretty fun. \u201d She also has royalties coming in from sales of \u201cI Want a Hippopotamus\u201d on iTunes. \u201cI thought my life as a    was going to be all about playing with my grandchildren,\u201d Ms. Peevey said. \u201cBut for people to have all this interest in me has opened things up for me  \u2014   I\u2019ve retired, but my song hasn\u2019t. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563350.354898}
