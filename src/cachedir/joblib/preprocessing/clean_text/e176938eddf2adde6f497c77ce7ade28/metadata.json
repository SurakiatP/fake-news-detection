Reines, Clinton\u2019s longtime aide who served as her senior advisor while she was Secretary of State. \\nIn the same email, Reines cryptically wrote about Clinton\u2019s email scandal that \u201cemail retention = Benghazi.\u201d \\nThe March 3, 2015 correspondence was posted by Wikileaks after the email was ostensibly captured in John Podesta\u2019s hacked gmail account. \\nThe message was a response to a suggestion from Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, that Clinton make a joke about the email fiasco during a charity dinner later that day. This was two months before the State Department publicly released the first batch of Clinton\u2019s emails, messages which had previously been provided to the House Select Committee on Benghazi . \\n\u201cGreetings. I wanted to float idea of HRC making a joke about the email situation at the Emily\u2019s List dinner tonight. What do folks think about that?\u201d Palmieri asked, in an email to numerous Clinton confidantes, including Podesta and Reines. \\n\u201cMargolis and I discussed,\u201d replied Mandy Grunwald, a communications adviser to Clinton. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the emails, so we are nervous about this. Might get a big laugh tonight and regret it when content of emails is disclosed.\u201d \\nThat\u2019s when Reines chimed in with his remarks: \\nTrust me, most of the email themselves are funnier than any joke we can come up with. Read in total by America she would either win 49 states, or lose 49 states. I go back and forth. \\nI\u2019m not hard over either way, but I would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke, because email retention = Benghazi. \\nBUT, if we could get some business done in a light way it\u2019s worth trying: signaling that she is more than fine with them making their way into the public domain. Because past the process stuff, next phase is content. And the assumption is that she did this secretly, hiding, etc. Simply not true. We can\u2019t jam State to release them at this point, but if Dan can think of a light way to say \u201cI am proud of the work we did at State and hopefully at some point everyone will be able to read what\u2019s in them as a way to better understand that work, but until then, I want to talk about\u2026\u201d Doesn\u2019t need to be at the top, could be at some natural point. \\nThat\u2019s my strong vote since I think her expressing more than a willingness for them to be released into the wild is what\u2019s most important.
