[\u201cHere, everything, pretty much everything you do in government involves heart, whereas in business most things don\u2019t involve heart,\u201d Trump told the Associated Press. \u201cIn fact, in business you\u2019re actually better off without it. \u201d  The interview comes as Trump approaches 100 days serving as president and Congress debates legislation that would keep the government funded. Trump stressed that there is a \u201chuman responsibility\u201d that comes with the job. He provided an example of that human responsibility to the AP when he explained how much risk went into the decision to strike Syrian President Bashar  \u2019s military. \u201cWhen it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m saying to myself, \u2018You know, this is more than just like 79 (sic) missiles. This is death that\u2019s involved because people could have been killed. This is risk that\u2019s involved. \u2019\u201d Trump is expected to hold a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, April 29 on the 100th day of his presidency, the same night as the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. Trump is also looking to cement his legacy in the first 100 days even further, saying in a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni that he expects both health care and government funding to pass this week.'"}, "time": 1742564554.2250836}
