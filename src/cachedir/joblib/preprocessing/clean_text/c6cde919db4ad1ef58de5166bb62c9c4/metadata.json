Ro Khanna ( ) of Silicon Valley vows that he will go to jail to protest the presidency of Donald Trump as part of the \u201cCalifornia Resistance\u201d to the new administration. [In an interview with Randy Shandobil of the \u201cThis Golden State\u201d podcast, Khanna, a   American whose parents immigrated from India, referred to Gandhi\u2019s campaign of civil disobedience against British rule in the subcontinent.  \u201cResistance, for me, is something  \u2014   I think of my grandfather. He spent four years in jail during Gandhi\u2019s independence movement in the 1940s to fight for India\u2019s freedom   \u2026     Donald Trump, as much of a step backwards as that was, has a   term   \u2026     four years in a democracy is a far easier challenge than the one my grandfather had. \u201d Khanna served in the Obama administration before challenging Rep. Mike Honda ( ) in an unsuccessful bid for the Silicon Valley seat in 2014. He came back again in 2016 and won. Asked what Khanna would do if federal agents came to his district, the 17th district of California, looking for immigrants to deport, Khanna said he would risk arrest. \u201cI think there is a point of civil disobedience. I hope it won\u2019t come to that   \u2026     if it came to a point where I thought there was a deep moral injustice, where they were rounding up folks who are going and living their lives, and have been in this country, and they\u2019re splitting families, and there is moment of moral leadership needed, then I think I would. \u201d Khanna said that Democrats had managed to \u201cresist\u201d in 2004 when George W. Bush won   and Republicans controlled Congress and proposed privatizing Social Security. The result, he proudly said, was that Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( ) had led Democrats to power in 2006. He praised Silicon Valley CEOs who had stood up for social issues in recent years, even if they had to seek common ground with the Trump administration on economic issues.  Shandobil challenged Khanna, noting that he shared some common stances with Trump, including support for term limits, opposition to the   Partnership, and reform of the   visa system. (Shandobil also asked Khanna to react to some of Trump\u2019s more controversial policies, erroneously claiming Trump wants to \u201cregister all Muslims. \u201d) Khanna said that his agreement with Trump on certain issues was coincidental and had nothing to do with supporting his presidency. \u201cCalifornia has to be a laboratory for resistance,\u201d Khanna said, citing the \u201cinnovative, progressive policies\u201d of the state. He called Trump an \u201caberration\u201d who did not have a mandate to change the country\u2019s policies, because he did not win the popular vote. Khanna added that stopping Trump from deporting illegal immigrants would be his top priority. \u201cThere was no accommodation with British imperialism,\u201d he said, referring to his grandfather\u2019s activism. \u201cAnything worth fighting for, whether it was the freedom movement in India, or the civil rights movement, it never accommodates with principles that are abhorrent. \u201d He said that Democrats should not resist everything Trump did just for the sake of resisting, but should oppose specific policies. He claimed that Republicans had done otherwise, opposing Obama even when they agreed with his policies. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
