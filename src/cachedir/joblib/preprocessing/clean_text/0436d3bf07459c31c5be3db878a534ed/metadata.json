I mean, there\u2019s not been a louder voice up here for repealing Obamacare. I really want to repeal it. I just don\u2019t want to replace with   or another federal program. The programs they put in place will be there forever. So the refundable tax credit, which is a subsidy by another name, will be there forever. And this  \u2014   these buying  \u2014   these   pools they want to create, Republicans used to hate the idea. They hated the idea when they were called risk corridors, and there were giving money to insurance companies. They were bailouts, when it was a Democrat idea. Now that it\u2019s a Republican idea, they keep sweetening it up. \u201d He later argued that the bill offers people who won\u2019t get subsidies anymore \u201cSanta  . \u201d Rand also said, \u201cI want everybody in the individual market to be protected against   conditions, by getting into the group market, and let market forces work. It can work, but the current bill acknowledges that it doesn\u2019t work, and then we just subsidize the insurance companies, which I think is deplorable. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742628451.7807279}
