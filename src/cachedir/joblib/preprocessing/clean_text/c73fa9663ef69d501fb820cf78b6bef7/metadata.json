Her first public remarks came in the form of a press avail at the U.N. , where she told reporters: \\n[W]hen I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two. \\nShe went on to emphasize that everything she did was above board and according to Hoyle. \\nBut despite her assurances \u2014 and perhaps as a direct consequence of her propensity for lying \u2014 the story refused to go away.
