The TIME magazine correspondents made sure to take note of the disparity between the food given to the president and the food they were served in a profile called \u201cDonald Trump After Hours,\u201d the profile the segment was based on. \u201cAt the dessert course, he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, instead of the single scoop for everyone else,\u201d TIME\u2019s Michael Scherer and Zeke Miller wrote. \u201cWith the salad course, Trump is served what appears to be Thousand Island dressing instead of the creamy vinaigrette for his guests,\u201d they added.
