Gorsuch, the Supreme Court nominee was asked to describe how he had come to President Trump\u2019s attention. The first thing he wrote was, \u201cI was contacted by Leonard Leo. \u201d Most Americans have probably never heard of Leonard A. Leo, who has long served as executive vice president of the Federalist Society, an organization of conservatives and libertarians who \u201cplace a premium on individual liberty, traditional values and the rule of law. \u201d But as Mr. Trump begins the process of filling what could be the most federal court vacancies left to any president in nearly a   Mr. Leo is playing a critical role in reshaping the judiciary. He sits at the nexus of an immensely influential but largely unseen network of conservative organizations, donors and lawyers who all share a common goal: Fill the federal courts with scores of judges who are committed to the narrow interpretation of the Constitution that they believe the founders intended. \u201cThe Supreme Court needs to be an institution that helps to undergird limited constitutional government,\u201d said Mr. Leo, 51, whose cerebral, unassuming demeanor belies the enormous clout he has developed in Washington. It is a worldview that has brought Mr. Leo and his allies together with a range of conservative players. In addition to major corporate backers such as Google and Chevron, the Federalist Society\u2019s supporters include     and   business leaders like Charles G. and David H. Koch the family foundation of Richard Mellon Scaife and the  Mercer family, which gave significantly to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and helped start Breitbart News. This judicial reformation is being coordinated from Washington by a relatively small team closely aligned around Mr. Leo, who is on leave from the Federalist Society while he helps the White House shepherd the Gorsuch nomination. The network includes John G. Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation and Ann Corkery, a Washington lawyer who along with her husband, Neil, oversees the Judicial Crisis Network and related   groups that also support the cause. While a   agenda and the desire to place judges who will be more skeptical of federal and state regulations is a driving force, several central players in the group are also motivated by intense religious beliefs. \u201cWe can have an incredible impact,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network. Ms. Severino counts among her clients Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist, a group of Catholic nuns who participated in a lawsuit that reached the Supreme Court alleging that Obamacare limited their religious freedom. Judge Gorsuch, 49, is their first test case, with his confirmation hearing set to begin on Monday  \u2014   but the conservative activists say more is at stake than just the Supreme Court. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d Mr. Leo said in a speech last month at the Ronald Reagan Dinner at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \u201cHow we deal with this vacancy now, the strength that we as the   movement demonstrate in this fight, will determine the extent to which we are able to both nominate and confirm   judges as we move forward. \u201d Mr. Trump already has 124 judgeships to fill  \u2014   a backlog created by Senate Republicans who blocked the confirmation of many of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees. That includes 19 vacancies on the federal appeals courts. Because of the age of many judges today, the White House expects between 70 to 90 appeals court positions to open up over the next four years. That would give Mr. Trump the opportunity to fill anywhere from   to half of all appellate seats  \u2014   a profound impact considering that those courts are often the final word on thousands of cases that never reach the Supreme Court. The scale and sophistication of the right\u2019s judicial confirmation efforts would seem to portend a dark period ahead for the left, which, despite having made great strides under Mr. Obama, finds itself outmaneuvered. \u201cThe right wing, very purposely and methodically, has built a stable of nominees that fit their ideological profile, and it\u2019s been a national movement, well organized and strategized,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, who serves on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cFrankly, I think the progressives of the Democratic Party have been less vigilant and vigorous than the right. \u201d There was little question to whom Mr. Trump would turn when he was putting together his list of possible Supreme Court nominees last year: Mr. Leo, who has spent almost his entire legal career at the Federalist Society, after graduating from Cornell Law School in 1989. The father of seven children and fond of speaking in biblical allusions, he rose to prominence more than a decade ago as the Republican Party\u2019s   of Catholic outreach. At Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s funeral last year, he read from the Old Testament. When President George W. Bush made his two nominations to the Supreme Court in 2005, picking Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Mr. Leo assumed the responsibility of coordinating outside campaigns to buttress their Senate confirmations. It is a role  \u2014   which he has described as analogous to running a political campaign  \u2014   that he has reprised with the Gorsuch confirmation. Mr. Leo has an exalted reputation among conservatives, including Scott Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general who is now head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitt recalled in a speech last year at the conservative bastion Hillsdale College how he was in Washington for a Federalist Society meeting in 2013. Mr. Leo asked him to stay an extra night for dinner, without giving a hint of who might show up. \u201cAny time that Leonard asks you to go to dinner, you stay, because he feeds you well,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said. But it was not only the menu that was impressive. Mr. Pruitt arrived to see Justices Scalia and Clarence Thomas at the table. \u201cWe spent three hours talking about the Constitution and things that we were involved in as attorneys general,\u201d Mr. Pruitt recalled. \u201cIt was a fabulous time. \u201d Mr. Leo has been at the center of Mr. Trump\u2019s judicial selection process since last spring, when Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign lawyer and now the White House counsel, introduced them. It helped enormously that Mr. Leo came to the campaign at a critical time of need. Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the conservative moment was tenuous at best. Last March, a prominent group of Catholic leaders in the United States, including several with close ties to Mr. Leo, published an open letter in National Review, a conservative magazine, declaring Mr. Trump \u201cmanifestly unfit to be president of the United States. \u201d It was the type of rejection that was becoming all too worrisome for Mr. Trump. At the same time, a faction of delegates threatened to block his nomination. So in May, in an unprecedented move for a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump shrewdly released the first of two lists of people he was considering to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Scalia, at first with help from Mr. Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation. Judge Gorsuch\u2019s name was added in a second version of this list, with Mr. Trump thanking the Federalist Society and Heritage for their help. Polls showed this published list of 21 names was a significant factor in the election. Of the   of voters who said the Supreme Court was the most important issue in their decision, 57 percent voted for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump gave broad discretion to Mr. Leo and his colleagues. Mr. Trump\u2019s most important criterion, these lawyers said, was that he wanted judges who were \u201cnot weak\u201d and of \u201chigh quality. \u201d Their approach in coming up with candidates was similar to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s. \u201cThey had this very sophisticated, detailed frame of reference from which they could begin to say, \u2018O. K. well, who understands these things like we do? \u2019\u201d Mr. Leo said in an interview, referring to the Reagan era. \u201cAs opposed to an administration that might sit around and say, \u2018Who\u2019s a really smart lawyer who\u2019s been really accomplished?\u2019 Or, \u2018Hey, what about my frat buddy from 1964? \u2019\u201d And as Reagan did by nominating Justices Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, Mr. Leo and his conservative colleagues have looked for judges who can serve as long as possible. \u201cYoung is good,\u201d Mr. Leo said. \u201cThere will be an opportunity for a transformation of the federal bench. \u201d Even before Mr. Trump walked into the East Room of the White House on Jan. 31 to name Judge Gorsuch as his first Supreme Court nominee, the public relations campaign to confirm him had started. \u201cNeil Gorsuch\u2019s talent and skill would make for a great #SupremeCourt Justice,\u201d said a post sent out on Twitter by the Judicial Crisis Network on the afternoon before the announcement. By that point, television and radio advertisements about Judge Gorsuch were already on their way to stations across the country. The campaign focused on five states picked for a very explicit reason: Each had a Democratic senator up for   next year, and all the states had voted to elect Trump. This more public part of the push  \u2014   Mr. Leo has never been particularly comfortable in the spotlight  \u2014   has been handled by Ms. Severino, 40, a Harvard Law School graduate who served as a clerk to Justice Thomas and is a frequent speaker at Federalist events. Ms. Severino said the group\u2019s efforts to secure Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation reflected the consensus of American voters, who picked Mr. Trump in part because of the Supreme Court choices he said he would make. But an examination of the Judicial Crisis Network\u2019s operations and financial records suggests that the group, in fact, has an incredibly narrow base. In 2015, the last year that tax records were available, the Judicial Crisis Network\u2019s entire budget of $5. 7 million appears to have come from a single donor, an organization called the Wellspring Committee, based in Manassas, Va. that describes its mission as advancing \u201climited government and free markets. \u201d Judicial Crisis and a sister organization, the Judicial Education Project, reported in tax returns that they had a total of only two employees and no volunteers, and instead largely relied on outside consultants, like CRC Public Relations, a Virginia firm that also lists the Federalist Society and other conservative groups as clients. Ms. Severino, asked whether her group was simply a shell to secretly move money on behalf of others, said the Judicial Crisis Network should not be judged based on the size of its staff. \u201cWe are not trying to be a large membership organization,\u201d Ms. Severino said in a written statement, sent by CRC, which asked that the remarks be attributed to her. \u201cThere are others who excel at that type of work, and we are happy to support them as allies. \u201d It is clear that there are close personal ties among the leaders of the push to confirm Judge Gorsuch. Ann and Neil Corkery help run a network of nonprofit organizations like Catholic Voices USA, an organization that promotes the church\u2019s views. They also help Mr. Leo in managing the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast, tax records show. There are even overlaps with the funding. Mr. Corkery is listed as treasurer of the Judicial Crisis Network. A separate Internal Revenue Service filing shows that Ms. Corkery is president of the Wellspring Committee. Tax records from the past two years also show that Mr. and Ms. Corkery were paid nearly $600, 000 to help run 15 nonprofit groups, including the Judicial Crisis Network. They declined requests to discuss their overlapping roles in these organizations. The impact of this intertwined network can also be seen in a number of   efforts to appoint more originalist judges. Last year, the Judicial Crisis Network and a second organization it donated money to bought political advertisements in two Supreme Court races in Arkansas, which are decided directly by voters. The advertising by the groups, which spent far more than the candidates themselves, attracted widespread attention to what has normally been a   race. The intervention was considered disturbing enough that the   state legislature held a special hearing last year where those targeted by the groups testified. \u201cI suppose some with misplaced or contorted egos might be flattered these shadowy groups would spend over a   dollars directed to keep one off the court,\u201c said Clark W. Mason, a Little Rock, Ark. lawyer who was one of the candidates for the Supreme Court. \u201cBut I am outraged. They are attempting to shift the scale of justice. \u201d The legislature this year failed to pass a law that would require a group like Judicial Crisis to disclose the source of its funding if it wants to play a similar role in future elections in the state. Judicial Crisis has also donated more than $2 million to the Republican Attorneys General Association  \u2014   making it the single largest contributor in the 2016 election cycle, as it sought to elect top state law enforcement officers who could bring   cases to state or federal courts with judges the group also helped put into place. Mark Holden, general counsel of Koch Industries, a donor to the Federalist Society, said in an interview that the efforts of these conservative legal activists were necessary to overcome a bias favoring judges who put their agendas before the law. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we have the right people in place, people who will follow our laws, judges who will follow our laws as they have been written and not as they wish they were written,\u201d Mr. Holden said. One point all the parties agree on: Mr. Trump must not repeat the mistake that Mr. Bush made in moving slowly to fill the many vacancies in the federal court system. Mr. Leo is ready to play his part. \u201cThose nominations to the lower federal courts are a high priority to the president and for senior administration staff,\u201d Mr. Leo said in an interview last month that was broadcast on  . He said the number of vacancies was historic. \u201cIt is something that is very much on the president\u2019s mind. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628564.5353034}
