C.  \u2014   A cellphone video made by the wife of Keith Lamont Scott as he was fatally shot by the police here shows the moments before and after the episode, including the wife\u2019s pleas to her husband to get out of his truck, and her pleas to the officers not to shoot him. But the video, which was given to The New York Times on Friday by lawyers for the family, does not include a view of the shooting itself. Nor does it answer the crucial question of whether Mr. Scott had a gun, as the police have maintained. This question and others surrounding the case have transformed Charlotte into the latest crisis in the divisive debate over police treatment of minorities. In the last several nights here, hundreds of protesters have taken to the streets demanding justice. Many have done so peacefully. Others have vandalized property and clashed with the police. One of the lawyers, Justin Bamberg, who is representing the family along with Eduardo Curry, said in an interview on Friday that the video did not prove whether the shooting was justified. Rather, he said, it offered \u201canother vantage point\u201d of the episode. He said he hoped the Police Department would release its own videos of the shooting, as protesters have demanded since Mr. Scott was killed on Tuesday. The video provided a vivid glimpse of the drama that played out as Mr. Scott\u2019s wife of 20 years, Rakeyia, first pleaded for a safe outcome to her husband\u2019s encounter with the police, and then was heard reacting in uncomprehending horror as he was shot to death. Mr. Scott, a father of seven, had parked his white Ford Explorer in a visitor\u2019s space at the apartment complex where he lived, about a   south of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He often waited there, on a   stretch of Lexington Circle, for one of his children to return home from school. Officers of the   Police Department arrived in unmarked vehicles shortly before 4 p. m. to serve a warrant on another person. Ms. Scott left their apartment to bring Mr. Scott a cellphone charger, the lawyers said, when she saw the officers around him and began recording the scene on her phone. The Police Department has said that officers saw Mr. Scott, who was black, standing beside his S. U. V. holding a handgun, then saw him get into the vehicle. The video, which lasts 2 minutes 12 seconds, begins with shaking images of grass and the voice, apparently that of an officer, shouting, \u201cHands up!\u201d Immediately, Ms. Scott said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him,\u201d and began walking closer to the officers and Mr. Scott\u2019s vehicle. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him. He has no weapon. He has no weapon. Don\u2019t shoot him. \u201d An officer can then be heard yelling: \u201cGun. Gun. Drop the gun. \u201d A police S. U. V. with lights flashing arrived, partly obscuring Ms. Scott\u2019s view, and a uniformed officer got out. From that point, there are five officers, most of whom appeared to be wearing body armor over plain clothes, around Mr. Scott. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him, don\u2019t shoot him,\u201d Ms. Scott pleaded, her voice becoming louder and more anxious. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. \u201d Officers continued to yell \u201cdrop the gun\u201d or some variation of it  \u2014   at least 12 times in 38 seconds. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a gun,\u201d Ms. Scott said. \u201cHe has a T. B. I. \u201d  \u2014   an abbreviation for a traumatic brain injury the lawyers said Mr. Scott sustained in a motorcycle accident in November. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine. \u201d \u201cDrop the gun,\u201d an officer screamed again as Ms. Scott tried to explain her husband\u2019s condition. The officer then said he needed to get a baton. \u201cKeith don\u2019t let them break the windows. Come on out the car,\u201d Ms. Scott said, as the video showed an officer approaching Mr. Scott\u2019s vehicle. \u201cDrop the gun,\u201d an officer shouted again. Ms. Scott yelled several times for her husband to \u201cget out the car,\u201d but on the video, he cannot be seen through the window of the S. U. V. \u201cKeith, don\u2019t do it,\u201d Ms. Scott shouted, as the video showed her backing away and panning to the ground. Mr. Bamberg said that Ms. Scott was trying, in those statements, to \u201cget him to stand still\u201d after he got out of the car. It was only in the final moments before the shots  \u2014   less than two seconds on the video  \u2014   that the camera panned back and Mr. Scott could be seen, still unhurt. He was standing between the vehicles and officers, wearing bright aqua pants, a dark   and a white ball cap, his head turning from side to side. Neither of his hands  \u2014   and what, if anything, he was holding  \u2014   could be seen clearly. Friends and neighbors have raised the possibility that he was holding a book. The police claimed that he was holding a gun, and that a gun was recovered from the scene. But the police chief, Kerr Putney, has acknowledged that in police videos of the shootings, he could not see Mr. Scott\u2019s hands. \u201cThe video does not give me absolute, definitive visual evidence that would confirm that a person is pointing a gun,\u201d he said on Thursday. Fifty seconds into Ms. Scott\u2019s video, four shots rang out. The Police Department has identified the officer who fired as Brentley Vinson, 26, who is black, and has been with the force since 2014. Ms. Scott seemed to flinch at the first gunshot, and the picture immediately left her husband. \u201cDid you shoot him? Did you shoot him?\u201d Ms. Scott shouted, her voice becoming louder each second. \u201cDid you shoot him? He better not be [expletive] dead. \u201d She moved closer, and the video showed Mr. Scott lying face down on the pavement, his white sneakers pointed to the camera, with officers standing and kneeling around him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to come near you. I\u2019m going to record, though,\u201d Ms. Scott said. \u201cI\u2019m not coming near you. I\u2019m going to record, though. He better be alive. \u201d Mr. Bamberg said of the video: \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t have enough facts to say whether this shooting was justified or unjustified. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to find out. \u201d The lawyers also brought attention to an object that they said could be seen on the ground near Mr. Scott after he was shot. They said the object seemed to appear in the video after the camera panned away briefly, in a place where no object was previously visible. The video had been widely viewed both online and on television by Friday afternoon. City and police officials did not respond to Ms. Scott\u2019s video. But in a statement on Friday, Jennifer Roberts, the mayor of Charlotte, pressed the state\u2019s Bureau of Investigation to speed up its efforts to release the police recordings. \u201cI urge it to use every resource at its disposal to get this done, and release the information to the public as quickly as possible,\u201d she said. Chief Putney arranged for Mr. Scott\u2019s family members and their lawyers to privately view two police videos on Thursday. Beforehand, they had been uncertain whether the videos should be released to the public, Mr. Bamberg said, but after seeing them, they called for release of the recordings. While the family members differed with the police on some major points about the videos, they seemed to be in agreement with the police chief on one aspect. \u201cIt is impossible to discern from the videos what, if anything, Mr. Scott is holding in his hands,\u201d they said in a statement. Mr. Bamberg and Mr. Curry also described the two police videos  \u2014   one from a dashboard camera and the other from a body camera  \u2014   that the police allowed the lawyers and family members to view. The   video, Mr. Bamberg said, provided few significant details of the shooting. But he said the dashboard video showed two officers taking up positions behind a pickup truck and yelling commands at Mr. Scott, who was inside his vehicle. The dashboard video, the lawyers said, appeared to show that the front window on the driver\u2019s side was rolled up. The video, Mr. Bamberg said, then showed Mr. Scott stepping out of the vehicle, his hands down, with his right hand empty and \u201csome type of object\u201d in his left hand. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to make out what it is,\u201d the lawyer said, noting that Mr. Scott was  . \u201cHe doesn\u2019t make any dramatic movements,\u201d Mr. Bamberg said. He also said Mr. Scott seemed \u201cconfused. \u201d In the video, Mr. Scott took a couple of steps forward \u201cin a nonaggressive manner,\u201d the lawyer said, and then a step back. Then shots were fired. According to court records, Mr. Scott, who was born in South Carolina, was charged in that state with a number of offenses including check fraud, aggravated assault and carrying a concealed weapon. Later, he moved to Texas, where he shot and wounded a man in San Antonio in 2002. He was convicted and sentenced, in 2005, to seven years in prison, and was released in 2011. His lawyer in the Texas shooting case, Gloria Yates Early, said Mr. Scott had claimed his family was being \u201cstalked. \u201d \u201cAllegedly, people were following them around with weapons, pointing them at their bodies,\u201d Ms. Early said. \u201cHe carried a gun around and he admitted to shooting a guy. He alleged   of himself and his family. \u201d When asked on Friday if Ms. Scott knew whether her husband owned a gun at the time he was shot by the police, Mr. Curry replied, \u201cNot that she knew of. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563140.4529526}
