Under the Obama administration millions of immigrants were allowed to enter the country without recourse and Border Patrol agents from Texas to California were told to stand down and do nothing.\\nTrump and others have said that undocumented workers pose a direct threat to the national security of the United States because with current immigration policies, which require no documentation whatsoever, it is impossible to know who is entering our country and from which country they originate. It\u2019s been reported that numerous individuals with ties to terrorism have been apprehended on the border , and that potentially scores of others have already been smuggled into the United States by Mexican drug cartels.\\nThough the President-Elect has promised to either deport or incarcerate millions of illegal immigrants with criminal records, he stopped short of claiming that all undocumented immigrants living in the United States would be deported:\\n\u2018After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that they\u2019re talking about who are terrific people, they\u2019re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that ,\u2019 Trump said.\\n\u2018But before we make that determination\u2026it\u2019s very important, we are going to secure our border.\u2019\\nWatch Trump make his promise to deport criminals in a September 1, 2016 Immigration Speech:\\nDay one, my first hour in office, those people are gone. You can call it \u2018deported\u2019 if you want\u2026 the press doesn\u2019t like that term\u2026 you can call it whatever you want\u2026 they\u2019re gone. \\nTheir days have run out in this country\u2026 the crime will stop\u2026 they\u2019re going to be gone. It will be over. \\n\\nIf you think Anti-Trump protestors have gone off the rails following Hillary\u2019s loss, just wait until Trump starts nationwide mass deportations. \\nWe encourage you to consider the implications of this policy and prepare for widespread violence now , because this could quickly escalate to open warfare on the street of America.\\nRelated: \\nA Step-By-Step Guide To Prepare For Any Disaster \\nIllegal Immigration And Gangs: Someday Our Cities Will Burn Because We Didn\u2019t Protect Our Borders \\nWatch: How Liberals React When Asked to House An Illegal Immigrant Child In Their Homes \\nThis Stunning Chart Shows How Trump\u2019s Border Wall Will Stop Illegal Immigration \\n\u201cThis Quickly Escalates Into Open Warfare\u201d \u2013 Why The Government Is Preparing For Post-Election Chaos '"}, "time": 1742561787.5191123}
