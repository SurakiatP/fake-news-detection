President Obama and other American officials saw the pledges from both Beijing and Washington as crucial: China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, followed by the United States. In the coming years, the opposite dynamic is poised to play out. President Trump\u2019s signing of an executive order on Tuesday aimed at undoing many of the Obama administration\u2019s climate change policies flips the roles of the two powers. Now, it is far likelier that the world will see China pushing the United States to meet its commitments and try to live up to the letter and spirit of the 2015 Paris Agreement, even if Mr. Trump has signaled he has no intention of doing so. \u201cThey\u2019ve set the direction they intend to go in the next five years,\u201d Barbara Finamore, a senior lawyer and Asia director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in New York, said of China. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they intend to double down on bringing down their reliance on coal and increasing their use of renewable energy. \u201d \u201cChina wants to take over the role of the U. S. as a climate leader, and they\u2019ve baked it into their   plans,\u201d she added, referring to the economic development blueprints drawn up by the Chinese government. Even before the presidential campaign last year, Mr. Trump had made statements consistent with climate change denial, including calling climate change a hoax created by China. He has also threatened to formally withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election in November, senior Chinese officials and leaders have been taking the high ground on the issue by urging all countries, including the United States, to abide by their climate commitments. The biggest rhetorical turning point came in January, when Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the Paris Agreement was \u201chard won\u201d and should remain in force. \u201cAll signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations,\u201d he said. Other Chinese officials at Davos repeated that message, including the energy minister, Nur Bekri, and top executives of   enterprises. In an interview before the recent climate conference in Marrakesh, Chai Qimin, a climate change researcher and policy adviser, said that policies adopted at a recent Communist Party meeting showed that China \u201chas attached ever greater importance to ecological civilization and green development. \u201d \u201cEveryone is taking this more and more seriously,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing that all countries in the Paris Agreement should \u201cfulfill their commitments\u201d and that China would stick to its pledges \u201cregardless of how other countries\u2019 climate policies change. \u201d Global Times, a   nationalist newspaper, used harsher language in an editorial chastising the Trump administration for \u201cbrazenly shirking its responsibility on climate change. \u201d \u201cWashington is obliged to set an example for mankind\u2019s efforts against global warming, and now the Trump administration has become the first government of a major power to take opposite actions on the Paris Agreement,\u201d the newspaper said. \u201cIt is undermining the great cause of mankind trying to protect the earth, and the move is indeed irresponsible and very disappointing. \u201d The editorial also questioned why China was making concessions on   use when the United States was scrapping its promises: \u201cHow can China, still underdeveloped, give away a chunk of room for development, just to nourish those Western countries that are already rich?\u201d Chinese participation is critical for global efforts on climate change. With its economic growth and rampant infrastructure construction, China consumes as much coal as the rest of the world combined. The burning of coal, which is at the core of the power, steel and cement industries in the country, generates enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. So environmental advocates and officials around the world constantly say China must break its coal addiction. But unlike in the United States, Chinese leaders and senior officials have consistently said that climate change is a serious problem and acknowledged that changing the energy mix to move away from   sources is important. And because of its air pollution crisis, China announced policies in 2013 to limit the use of coal in the country\u2019s three largest population centers. More recently, scientists have said that there is a dangerous cycle at work: Weather patterns from climate change are exacerbating the smog. \u201cChina is cutting back on coal because of its lethal costs to human health as well as its high carbon emissions, and plans to transition to the energy sources of tomorrow, rather than yesterday,\u201d said Isabel Hilton, founder of Chinadialogue, a prominent website that reports on environmental issues and policy. \u201cPresident Trump seems intent on reviving a   energy source rather than pursuing the promise of the 21st century. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s   talk, and the unlikelihood that his administration will pressure China to cut back on fossil fuels, might mean that   interests in China, including among   energy companies, will try harder to push back against officials putting limits on coal. But in recent years, coal consumption in China has declined slightly, surprising many analysts and researchers. China\u2019s economic slowdown  \u2014   from decades of   annual growth to 6. 7 percent last year  \u2014   has been a major factor. Analysts say there appeared to be an increase in coal use during part of 2016 because of economic stimulus policies, but preliminary statistics released in February indicate that overall coal consumption declined last year compared with 2015. Given such numbers, researchers say China may reach a carbon emissions peak in 2025  \u2014   five years ahead of its stated goal of 2030. China has also made pledges on the percentage of total energy that will be generated by    sources, which include hydropower, nuclear power, wind and solar. Mr. Xi has said that by 2030, 20 percent of China\u2019s energy will come from such sources. Chinese officials are now grappling with the complex problem of getting energy generated by wind and solar sources onto the grid and properly used. \u201cTrump\u2019s rejection of regulatory action on climate change creates a vacuum in global climate leadership that China can now seize,\u201d said Alex L. Wang, a law professor and China environmental expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cIn recent years, a variety of factors  \u2014   crisis levels of pollution, economic opportunities from green development and concerns about the domestic risks of rising temperatures  \u2014   have pushed China to action on climate change. Trump\u2019s actions don\u2019t affect these underlying drivers. \u201d In addition, China has said that it will put in place by the end of this year a national market for greenhouse gas quotas, commonly known as a    program. It has experimented with seven such regional markets, and there have been problems with them, but the government is determined to set up a national program to put a price on carbon and impose a cost on companies that generate large amounts of carbon dioxide, Chinese policy advisers say. China appears to be overperforming on other targets besides its carbon emissions peak date. It had stated that by 2020, 58 percent of its energy would come from coal consumption. Official statistics indicate China might meet that target early. Chinese officials now say they expect to get the number down to 60 percent this year. A report released in January by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, based in Ohio, said China was the world leader in domestic investment in renewable energy and associated    sectors, with $103 billion invested in 2015. And China is going global with that strategy  \u2014   last year, it invested $32 billion in large overseas deals involving renewable energy. \u201cThere are clear differences between the Chinese approach and the Trump administration on climate change,\u201d Ms. Hilton said. \u201cWhile Trump\u2019s administration seems to believe that action on climate change is a waste of money and threatens jobs in the U. S. China sees investment in   action as essential to secure a safe and prosperous future for Chinese citizens, as well as a strategic opportunity to develop and supply the technologies of the future. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563293.7581587}
