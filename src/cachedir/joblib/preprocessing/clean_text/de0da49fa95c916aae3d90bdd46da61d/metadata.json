Both Clinton and Donald Trump have received these briefings since their respective party conventions in June. \\nOn Friday, the Director of the FBI, James Comey, notified Congress that the Bureau was effectively reopening its investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while Secretary of State. Comey wrote that new emails had surfaced that led investigators to warrant further examination. \\nAccording to sources familiar with the investigation the newly-found emails were found on a device of Clinton\u2019s personal aide Huma Abedin. Abedin is married to disgraced NY Congressman Anthony Wiener, and it is believed that the emails were discovered during an ongoing investigation into his sexting scandal. \\nThis latest revelation, including the suspension of weekly intelligence briefings, does not bode well for the former Secretary of State in the final days of a heated election. Donald Trump has seized on the news, and he is expected to continue to do so in the coming week.\u201d \\n'"}, "time": 1742562242.5605536}
