The jury\u2019s decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the land-rights movement. \\nThe Bundy brothers still face prosecution in Nevada with their father, Cliven Bundy, all accused in the 2014 standoff at the patriarch\u2019s ranch over unpaid grazing fees that pitted the family and their supporters against federal Bureau of Land Management agents. \\nThe Oregon prosecutors sat silently in front of their boss, U.S Attorney Billy Williams, and the head of the FBI in Oregon, Greg Bretzing, as the judge announced the \u201cnot guilty\u201d pleas one by one. \\nWilliams later thanked the jury in a written statement. \u201cWhile we had hoped for a different outcome, we respect the verdict of the jury and thank them for their dedicated service during this long and difficult trial,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe strongly believed that this case needed to be brought before a Court, publicly tried and decided by a jury.\u201d \\nBretzing, whose agents led the response to the Jan. 2 refuge seizure, offered a slightly different take. \u201cWe believe now \u2014 as we did then \u2013 that protecting and defending this nation through rigorous obedience to the U.S. Constitution is our most important responsibility.\u201d \\nEach defendant stood separately, facing the jury, as the judge read the verdicts. Ammon Bundy, his hands clasped behind his back, nodded as the \u201cnot guilty\u201d came for him first. As he sat, he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer, Marcus Mumford. \\nRyan Bundy nodded his head and mouthed to jurors, \u201cThank you.\u201d \\n\u201cI had a very peaceful feeling but I didn\u2019t know we\u2019d all be found not guilty,\u201d said defendant Shawna Cox. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m so grateful to the jury.\u201d \\nDefendant Neil Wampler hugged his defense lawyer and gave her a kiss. \\nBut the trial fireworks weren\u2019t quite over. A brawl broke out at the very end, when six to seven U.S. marshals surrounded Ammon Bundy\u2019s lawyer as he stood before the judge, arguing and shouting for his client to walk out the door a free man. They tackled him and stunned him with a Taser gun. As Mumford yelled, \u201cWhat are you doing?,\u201d U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown ordered, \u201cEverybody out of the courtroom!\u201d \\n\u201cAll I was asking for was papers,\u201d Mumford said after emerging from federal custody nearly two hours later. \u201cJust show me you have the authority to take Mr. Bundy into custody.\u201d \\nMumford was cited by Federal Protective Services for failure to follow a lawful order and creating a disturbance. He said the marshals overreacted. Several fellow defense lawyers echoed his sentiments, though one questioned Mumford\u2019s judgment. \\nAs for the verdict, Mumford said, \u201cVery pleased, very gratified. This jury was dedicated. They listened to our case.\u201d \\nProsecutors had argued the case was simple: The refuge occupiers took control of a wildlife refuge that wasn\u2019t theirs. The heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the 41-day takeover, in an of itself, was \u201cintimidating,\u201d and prevented officers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management from carrying out their work. \\nBut defense lawyers said they believe the jury held true to the judge\u2019s instructions, and couldn\u2019t find beyond a reasonable doubt that their \u201cintent\u201d was to prevent the federal employees from going to work. \\nFive of the seven defendants took the stand and said they were protesting the return to prison of Harney County ranchers Dwight Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond, who faced a minimum mandatory five-year sentence for arson to federal land. Steven Hammond was convicted partially of setting fire to refuge property. They also said they were protesting federal government overreach, and didn\u2019t give much thought at all to the federal employees whose desks and offices they used throughout the refuge takeover. \\nWhile it may be easier to show that defendants charged in a drug trafficking conspiracy shared a common goal, in this case there was \u201cno obvious underlying self-interest,\u201d said Matthew Schindler, who represented Kenneth Medenbach. \\nSchindler also said he believed the judge\u2019s decision to allow defendants to explain their \u201cstate of mind,\u201d at the time of the occupation boosted the defense case. The pull of jurors from across the state, not just Portland, also helped defendants, particularly regarding the weapons charges, Schindler said. \\nThe jury saw that the occupiers cared about the Hammonds and didn\u2019t like how the federal government was treating them, said David Fry\u2019s lawyer Per C. Olson. \\n\u201cI think the jury saw through this that they were well-meaning, well-intentioned individuals,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt was the right verdict.\u201d \\nLisa Maxfield, who represented Wampler, came out of the courthouse, holding up her fists. She said she has never seen \u201canything like this happen,\u201d where multiple defendants in a federal trial were all acquitted. It was one of the most significant cases in her career, she said. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous victory for rural America,\u201d Wampler said outside the courthouse as supporter and fellow refuge occupier Brand Nu Thornton blew his shofar and another man rode his horse back and forth, hoisting an American flag. \\nBut others, like Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, worried the verdicts would spur other similar armed standoffs against the government\u2019s control of public lands that involve the militia. \\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed in today\u2019s verdict, which puts our park rangers and scientists at further risk just for doing their jobs. The outcome of today\u2019s trial will undoubtedly embolden extremist groups,\u201d Rokala said. \u201d It\u2019s imperative that local, state, and federal law enforcement ensure the safety of our land managers.\u201d \\nOregonian Staff Writers Aimee Green and Jim Ryan contributed to this story. \\n\u2014 Maxine Bernstein'"}, "time": 1742562524.7138999}
