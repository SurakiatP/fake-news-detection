The 1917 declaration pledged British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. \\nA spokesperson for the Israeli embassy said the gathering \u201cgave voice to racist tropes against Jews and Israelis alike.\u201d \\nAccording to the Times, an audience member was applauded after suggesting Hitler only decided to kill Jews after being provoked by anti-German protests led by a rabbi, Stephen Wise, in New York. \\n\u201c[He] made the boycott on Germany, the economic boycott\u2026 which antagonized Hitler, over the edge, to then want to systematically kill Jews wherever he could find them.\u201d \\nRead more \\nThe speaker also said Rabbi Wise told the New York Times in 1905 there were \u201c6 million bleeding and suffering reasons to justify Zionism.\u201d This quote is often used by Holocaust deniers to suggest the figure of 6 million Jews later killed by the Nazis was a myth. \\nThe audience member \u2013 reportedly a member of the anti-Zionist strictly Orthodox Neturei Karta sect \u2013 also compared Israel to IS. \\n\u201cJust as the so-called Jewish state in Palestine doesn\u2019t come from Judaism. This Islamic State in Syria is nothing with Islam. It is a perversion of Islam just as Zionism is a perversion of Judaism.\u201d \\nAnother audience member said, to applause: \u201cIf anybody is anti-Semitic, it\u2019s Israelis themselves.\u201d \\nDavid Collier, a blogger who attended the session, says he \u201cwitnessed a Jew-hating festival at the heart of the British estate.\u201d \\nThe event run by Baroness Tonge, a former Liberal Democrat MP who sits as an independent, and the Palestinian Return Centre. \\nTonge reportedly made no attempt to challenge the comments. \\nShe has run into trouble for her own anti-Israeli outbursts and resigned as the Lib Dem whip after claiming the state of Israel was \u201cnot going to be there forever.\u201d \\nThe House of Lords event was also run by the Palestinian Return Centre. \\nCampaigners are calling on Britain to apologize for the Balfour Declaration and show remorse for its \u201cpast colonial crimes\u201d in Palestine. \\nVia RT .
