{"duration": 0.5415270328521729, "input_args": {"text": "'Before dawn on a Sunday late last month, a battalion of pesh merga soldiers  \u2014   about 600 Kurdish men, along with a few women  \u2014   gathered in the shadow of Bashiqa Mountain, on the western edge of the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan. They were sons, daughters, fathers, grandfathers. They wore an assortment of camouflage fatigues and traditional Kurdish flowing pants, waist sashes and head scarves. They carried antique Kalashnikovs and new assault rifles. Few had helmets, and fewer had body armor. Strapped to their backs and belts and legs were daggers, revolvers, axes. Some of them had received the call to duty only the day before and were driven to the front by family or rode overnight in taxis. With them was a column of vehicles new, old and very old: armored personnel carriers,     vehicles (MRAPs) Humvees, S. U. V. s, ambulances, Soviet tanks, backhoes, bulldozers,   sedans and a bestiary of retrofitted pickups and battlewagons, whose tenuous welding and argumentative suspensions told of the years Iraqi Kurds had spent fighting with    and homemade hardware in one war or another. At 7 a. m. the idling engines came to life, and cries went up: \u201cLong live pesh merga!\u201d \u201cDeath to ISIS!\u201d The troops started down an unpaved track that led southwest through the Tigris River valley toward the city of Mosul. As the march went on, villages gave way to occasional abandoned farmhouses, crop fields to dunes, and the sun made itself felt. A long dust cloud rose in the wake of the column, whose eventual destination was Bashiqa, a small city on the mountain\u2019s edge that was claimed by the Islamic State. The operation to retake Mosul had finally begun one week earlier on Oct. 16. The pesh merga led the charge toward the city, Iraq\u2019s   and ISIS\u2019 last citadel in the country. Mosul had become the focus of the world\u2019s attention, and the battle for it had been criticized even before it began. In the second presidential debate, Donald Trump complained that in revealing its designs on Mosul, the international   coalition was telegraphing its punches. This was inevitably true  \u2014   not even ISIS had ever doubted that Mosul would be invaded  \u2014   but it was also true that the first flurry of blows was too big to duck. Embedded in the column was a unit of American Special Forces, in a cluster of MRAPs. They were there, it was understood, to pick out targets for airstrikes. Rumbling in the distance, the bombs had deposited on the horizon a dome of inky vapor. While the pesh merga attacked ISIS from the north and the east, the Iraqi military was approaching from the south. The job of the battalion moving toward Bashiqa was to shore up the eastern front and extend a cordon around Mosul. The Iraqis\u2019 next moves would depend in part on the Kurds\u2019 success. For the moment, in other words, the progress of the central conflict in the Middle East had come down to this unlikely troop. The first ISIS mortar fire arrived in the midmorning with whizzes and thuds. It was off target, and the soldiers regarded the dirt plumes with indifference. The first incoming bullets soon followed and were cause for more alarm. They flew from a rambling,     house on the crest of a slope. The gunfire split the column in two. The back portion halted behind a berm about 12 feet high and about 300 yards downslope from the house. A few soldiers climbed up the dirt and took aim. The rest got out of their vehicles and pulled out phones and cigarettes. Group photos and selfies were snapped. \u201cLet\u2019s use the cannon,\u201d a commander suggested. A pickup mounted with an   gun pulled in front of the berm. The first shot fell short a second hit the house, leaving a disappointingly small hole in the facade. When there was a pause in the fighting, a group of trucks emerged from behind the berm, raced up the track and cut right onto a hillock that overlooked the house. Some pesh merga got out and gathered. They presented a clear target for snipers and artillery, but they didn\u2019t appear to mind. They chatted, laughed, smoked, checked their phones. More group photos, more selfies. Even after two mortar rounds landed in quick succession on either side of them  \u2014   a sign that a spotter was nearby, bracketing their position  \u2014   they remained unhurried. Eventually they got back into their vehicles and, under fire from the house, headed straight for it. The ISIS fighters had built their own berm beside the house\u2019s exterior wall. The Kurdish soldiers backed their trucks up to it, and one of them opened up on the house with a   machine gun. Others peeked over the berm, taking the occasional potshot. One walked up to a gap in the dirt and, with neither cover nor helmet, a cigarette dangling from his lips, emptied a magazine. The   jammed. The fighting subsided again. The soldiers reclined at the base of the berm. Out came the phones. More selfies. Texting. A man called his mother. Another watched a video of a firefight taking place on some other front around Mosul. None of them seemed eager to storm the house. \u201cI\u2019m deaf from that cannon!\u201d a soldier said. \u201cDid you take any photos of it being shot?\u201d another asked him. The gunner got into an argument with another soldier over whose responsibility it had been to make sure the   was working properly that morning. \u201cYou were supposed to fix it!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not my job!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not as if you had to build an airplane. It\u2019s simple. \u201d \u201cYou came all the way to the front in a taxi, and now all you do is talk. You just talk. \u201d Another burst of gunfire from the house, and a soldier climbed behind the   gun. \u201cCome help me,\u201d he instructed a colleague. \u201cI don\u2019t know how. \u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t get up here and help me, I\u2019m going to do everything that\u2019s bad to you. \u201d The gun was loaded and fired. The backblast shattered a pickup\u2019s windshield. \u201cBazan, where are your cigarettes?\u201d Bazan ran to a truck and returned with a pack of cigarettes. \u201cWho wants a cigarette?\u201d The group lit up. \u201cEveryone here talks like a man,\u201d a soldier said, \u201cbut no one fights like one. \u201d There was a note of false modesty in this quip. In fact, for centuries Kurds have fought famously, taking on all comers: Persians, Ottomans, Arabs, British and the various governments of Iraq. A diffuse institution  \u2014   \u201cmore an attitude than an army,\u201d as one Kurd put it  \u2014   the pesh merga today contain anywhere from several tens of thousands to about a hundred thousand fighters, depending on who\u2019s counting and how proud he\u2019s feeling. Many are volunteers. Only some of them have training that would warrant the name in a major military. The one thing they all share is that they are willing to die for their land. If their tactics are negligible  \u2014   and sometimes as suicidal as those of the jihadists  \u2014   their bravery is not. The pesh merga are commanded by Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government. When ISIS overran Mosul in June 2014, Barzani offered the help of his army to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal   who snubbed him. It was assumed Maliki worried that Barzani intended to annex whatever land his troops took. Maliki\u2019s successor, Haider   may have delayed the invasion of Mosul for the same reason. But earlier this year, Barzani, Abadi and the international coalition arrived at an agreement that called for the Kurdish forces to halt their advance at Bashiqa. About six miles from the eastern outskirts of Mosul, Bashiqa was inhabited largely by Christians, Kurds and members of the Yazidi minority, most of whom fled when ISIS arrived. The city presented an added political wrinkle in the war because it is in the \u201cdisputed territories,\u201d land claimed by both Iraq and the Kurdish regional government. Certain Kurds, mainly older ones, consider Mosul theirs, too. Partly for this reason  \u2014   but more because they\u2019re accustomed to fighting against the Iraqi military, not alongside it  \u2014   some pesh merga worried they would be attacked, or at least mistreated, by Iraqi soldiers when the two forces met on the front lines. Speculation about a sequel war between Kurdistan and Iraq was (and still is) commonplace. But so far relations were cordial, and the Iraqi military, knowing it would have its hands full with the close combat in Mosul\u2019s ancient streets, was content to leave the Bashiqa campaign to the Kurds. \u201cThis war is very different for us Kurds,\u201d Barzani\u2019s brother, Sihad Barzani, explained several days after the campaign began. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen airstrikes that we\u2019re not afraid of. This is the first time the Iraqi Army is not trying to kill us  \u2014   and we\u2019re not trying to kill them. We hope it stays this way. \u201d He was in a large abandoned house that the pesh merga had commandeered and turned into a field headquarters on the periphery of Bashiqa. The march had brought them to the limits of the city. They had not yet entered, but they had it surrounded. \u201cISIS has no escape. They will have to die now. \u201d The Barzanis are de facto royalty in Kurdistan. Massoud and Sihad\u2019s father, Mustafa, the patriarch of the incipient Iraqi Kurdish republic, led its revolution against Iraq until his death in 1979. It\u2019s common to meet pesh merga with tattoos of Mustafa\u2019s portrait. As Sihad stepped from the house, a young soldier lifted up his shirt to reveal the face of Mustafa, with his thick black mustache and checkered red head scarf, sprawled across his back. Sihad looked on approvingly. Asked how many of his own family members were fighting ISIS, he gestured at the soldiers gathered in the courtyard and said, \u201cThey\u2019re all my family. \u201d The Tigris River valley is dotted with villages and olive groves. The ISIS fighters inhabiting it were experienced and disciplined. What they lacked in munitions they made up for in patience, as the pesh merga had learned. Some Kurds had developed a reluctant respect for their adversary. \u201cThey fight as if they want to die,\u201d it was often said. The night before, the jihadists had told the residents of Buharbuq, an   village near Bashiqa, to be ready to leave at 6 a. m. for Mosul. The intent was obvious: They would be used as human shields. In the middle of the night, the village fled en masse. After leaving the headquarters, Barzani\u2019s convoy passed the refugee caravan, 80 or so cars and trucks stretched along a roadside. The residents of Buharbuq had taken everyone and everything they could: children, mattresses, blankets, grandmothers, pots, buckets, sheep, chickens. One truck contained a motorized wheelchair, another seven newborn lambs. The women were still dressed according to ISIS decree, fully covered in black hijabs and abayas. Officers with the Asayish, a Kurdish internal security agency, met the villagers on the road with a fleet of buses that would take them to a   camp. A soldier pulled up with a freight truck full of crackers and water. \u201cAll of our life is wasted in this ISIS mess,\u201d a woman waiting in line said to her husband. \u201cI feel a hundred years old. I hope ISIS goes to hell, then rots in hell. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d her husband replied. There were heartsick roadside reunions. Two old classmates, one a pesh merga who had fled Buharbuq, the other a shop owner who had stayed, hugged for the first time in two years. \u201cLife was very bitter,\u201d the shop owner told his friend. He pulled from his pocket a   note, less than a dollar. \u201cThis is all my money. \u201d A young man found his mother. She clung to his neck and wept and kissed his face again and again. \u201cThank God,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThank God. \u201d Perhaps the bravest pesh merga are the drivers of earthmovers, who toil mere yards from ISIS positions. They are bombed, mortared, rocketed and sniped, all the while doing astonishingly fast work. Within two days of setting off toward Bashiqa, they had turned the valley into a grid of berms and trenches that prevented an ISIS breakout and cut off the group\u2019s supply lines. About 4, 000 Kurdish soldiers now occupied 100 positions and small encampments. The main camp was presided over by Barham Arif, one of the youngest and most respected generals in the pesh merga. Tall and taciturn, he led his men into battle in a jaunty     MRAP with a GoPro camera   to the hood. \u201cISIS is not smart and not brave, but they brainwash stupid people,\u201d Arif said. \u201cThey give drugs to their fighters. They fight for 20 minutes and then run away. \u201d For months, Arif had lived with his men on the pesh merga\u2019s stalemated front line, on the ridge of Bashiqa Mountain, overlooking the valley. A modest cult of personality had formed around the general, and his camp was home to foreign volunteers and soldiers of fortune. There were American medics, a Brazilian and Czech videographer couple and, constantly at Arif\u2019s side, a   Scottish   sniper in spectacles. On Facebook, under employer, he listed \u201cpesh merga. \u201d Generations of Kurds also converged in the camp. A few soldiers were in their 20s. Most were in their 30s, 40s and 50s. One soldier who had come down from the mountain with Arif was Kaefe Ahmed. Ahmed\u2019s father, also a pesh merga fighter, was killed by Iraqi soldiers when Ahmed was 4. Ten other family members had died in war. Ahmed refused to wear a camouflage uniform because, he said, \u201cfor decades the Iraqi Army destroyed our land with these uniforms. \u201d He had fought for more than 20 of his 37 years: in the Kurdish civil war, against Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces and now against ISIS. He and his cousin Robar Ali were in a unit with a   group of men, some of them related. When ISIS entered Mosul, they fought on its outskirts, before the pesh merga were ordered to withdraw. Had ISIS stopped there, Ahmed and Ali, like most Iraqi Kurds, wouldn\u2019t have worried much about the jihadists living nearby. This was a conflict among Arabs, they felt, and at first ISIS was better than Saddam\u2019s Baathists ever were. \u201cIn the beginning, the ISIS fighters were generally good with people,\u201d Ahmed said. But then ISIS pushed into Kurdistan. Ahmed and Ali fought them in Sinjar, and then in Bashiqa, before it was overrun. The fighting there was particularly bitter. \u201cThey\u2019re suicidal,\u201d he said. The oldest soldier in the camp, as far as anyone knew, was a man named Jamil Rashid. When asked about his age, he first said, \u201cA lot. \u201d Later offerings ranged from 61 to 78. Asked how many battles he\u2019d fought in over the years, he said, \u201cThat notebook does not have enough paper to write them all down. \u201d He ate what food local   brought to the camp and slept wrapped in a thin blanket in a ditch. Five of his sons were in the pesh merga. One had recently been killed by ISIS. He had more grandchildren than he cared to count. \u201cISIS is nothing  \u2014   they\u2019ve been around for two years,\u201d said Rashid, who was fond of listing, in the profanest terms possible, the Iraqi premiers whose regimes he\u2019d fought against. \u201cAbd   Qasim\u201d  \u2014   the Iraqi prime minister of the early 1960s. \u201cI screwed his mother. Then there was Ahmed Hassan   and then Saddam, and then Nuri  . He was a bad guy. And now  \u2014   what\u2019s his name again?\u201d \u201cAbadi,\u201d a young soldier said. \u201cRight, Abadi. I fought all of them on this holy ground  \u2014   for this holy ground. Our mud is holy. Whoever doesn\u2019t fight for his land takes it in the [expletive]. This land is so precious. \u201d \u201cWhy are you talking about history, Jamil?\u201d another young soldier asked him. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be discussing now. \u201d \u201cSo what if I talk about history?\u201d Rashid said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same, history and now. \u201d On Tuesday morning, Arif\u2019s men prepared to assault Omar Qapchi, a village barely a   from his camp that was still under ISIS control. A commander had got hold of some villagers on a cellphone and was telling them what to do when the fighting started. \u201cStay together, don\u2019t separate,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see any ISIS, call this number. Take care of yourselves. We\u2019re coming. \u201d The armored personnel carriers and tanks and trucks filled up in moments. Far more soldiers wanted to take part in the assault than there was space in vehicles. Omar Qapchi, spreading about a mile down a slope that ended in an arterial road at the foot of Bashiqa Mountain, was made up of tightly packed   and   homes. Near its western gate, the column split into three smaller convoys. Arif\u2019s convoy cut across a field toward the road. Though the ground was known to be full of I. E. D. s, some pesh merga cut one another off as they careered over suspicious patches of dirt and objects, racing to get into the action. When the convoy reached the road, muzzle flashes appeared in windows, and bullets whizzed by. The pesh merga strafed the buildings with   fire and grenades. At the eastern gate, the convoy hooked into the village. The streets were empty. From the residents who had phoned, it was known that about a dozen ISIS fighters were somewhere in the village. The convoy raced into the village center and suddenly found itself in a firefight with a contingent of ISIS gunmen, who, surrounded, had taken a stand at one end of a short, wide alley. The soldiers, on the other end, jumped from their vehicles, piled into the alley  \u2014   directly in the line of fire  \u2014   and began shooting back. There was little aiming but a lot of yelling. One man stepped into the alley with a grenade launcher. He pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He held the rocket inches from his nose and looked at it quizzically. As bullets hit the dirt near his feet, he slowly peeled off a piece of plastic wrapping, then lifted the launcher back onto his shoulder and tried again. This time it fired. The ISIS fighters took to their heels, and the soldiers, among them Ahmed, gave chase, eventually cornering several jihadists in a mosque. One detonated a suicide vest another was sheared in half by a rocket. By the end of the day, eight of them had died, three had escaped and one was captured. Three pesh merga sustained minor wounds. Rather than going on foot from house to house to make sure the village was cleared, they gathered outside it and celebrated. \u201cI think I killed someone,\u201d Rashid said. \u201cIt would be a shame if I shot my rifle and didn\u2019t kill anyone. \u201d Two days later, the wind at their backs, Arif\u2019s men moved on Faziliya, a neighboring village. The road to the village was littered with I. E. D. s, which sent up showers of gravel and tarmac. On the wall of a kiosk at the entrance to the village was  : \u201cEvery ISIS man who dies goes to paradise. \u201d An ISIS flag fluttered on a fence post, but the roofs of the houses, which ranged steeply up the foot of the mountain, bore newly hung white flags: The town\u2019s residents were eagerly awaiting the pesh merga\u2019s arrival. Then gun and rocket fire erupted from a small, windowed spire on a building near the road. A tank reduced the building to smoking rubble. The people of Faziliya streamed from their homes and into the streets. They patted their heads  \u2014   a Kurdish gesture of welcome  \u2014   and kissed the soldiers. Children chanted: \u201cLong live pesh merga! Long live pesh merga!\u201d In the village square, a group of boys tore down an ISIS billboard. Soldiers shot off celebratory rounds. \u201cWho has cigarettes?\u201d a man asked the soldiers. \u201cWe want to smoke!\u201d A soldier found his wife and children  \u2014   their first meeting in more than two years. His mother emerged. She took hold of her son. They sank to the ground in an embrace, their tears streaming together. Back at Omar Qapchi, the few residents who had remained for the battle were gathered outside the village next to a caged soccer pitch, where they awaited interrogation by the soldiers and Asayish officers. An elderly woman wanted to know where her brother was. A rocket had destroyed his house, and he was nowhere to be seen. \u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d a neighbor of hers explained, out of earshot, \u201cbut she hasn\u2019t found out yet. \u201d An officer had already determined that one resident was allied with ISIS. The man was dragged from the group, his hands bound behind his back with a scarf. A green knit face mask was pulled down over his eyes, and he was forced to the ground. He pleaded his innocence. \u201cShut up, you imbecile!\u201d a soldier yelled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious he\u2019s ISIS,\u201d another soldier said. \u201cJust look at his color. He\u2019s taken on the jihadists\u2019 color. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not with ISIS, I swear!\u201d the prisoner said. \u201cI\u2019m a Kurd!\u201d \u201cShut up or I\u2019ll stuff this down your throat!\u201d the first soldier said, jabbing his rifle\u2019s stock in the man\u2019s face. The officer was from Omar Qapchi and had fled the village as ISIS approached it in 2014. From his friends who had stayed, he had heard that the prisoner had driven an ambulance for the jihadists. His son, they said, was with ISIS, too. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything!\u201d the prisoner protested. \u201cI was just told to drive somewhere. \u201d \u201cHit him already,\u201d another soldier said. The prisoner\u2019s son, his hands also bound and face covered, was pushed down beside his father. \u201cMy son is a student in Bashiqa,\u201d the father said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything about him. Please don\u2019t put the gun to his head. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m just following orders,\u201d the soldier said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said an Asayish commander who had arrived on the scene. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ISIS. We have to investigate. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve humiliated my son!\u201d \u201cSo are you saying your son is ISIS or not?\u201d the soldier asked. \u201cHe\u2019s a student! He\u2019s in ninth grade!\u201d They were bundled into the bed of a pickup and driven away. The Islamic State, the pesh merga knew, hadn\u2019t conquered such large swaths of the country with weapons alone. It had won sympathy among many Sunni Muslims who felt neglected by Iraq\u2019s   national government and abused by security forces. ISIS promised them protection and pride. Many of them saw ISIS as a way out of an already miserable existence. In a   camp near Khazer, another   town, an elderly farmer who\u2019d fled the village of Topzawa, not far from Bashiqa, which the Iraqi military had taken a few days before, talked about the jihadists fondly. \u201cMost of the young men who joined ISIS were poor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey needed the money. They had no other options. \u201d He confessed that he had come to know some of the ISIS men in Topzawa well. They weren\u2019t foreigners, but Iraqis, ordinary ones. They were kind. They allowed him to travel wherever he wanted to sell his produce. He didn\u2019t mind that the women in his family had to put on more clothing, and he wore a beard anyway. They treated his wife and daughters with the respect that Islam required. \u201cAt the beginning of Islam, with Muhammad, there were good rules. But with democracy, there are no rules. I\u2019m a fair person. I believe in justice. But there are rules in Islam. No one can change them. Not you, not me, not anyone. \u201cISIS treated us as though we were free,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe felt secure under them. In the final battle, they conducted themselves honorably. They fought until they died. \u201d The Iraqi Army, by contrast, relied on foreign airstrikes. The bombs had killed 20 of his sheep, 10 of his chickens and 10 dogs, and when the soldiers finally arrived, they were \u201cvery, very bad. \u201d They forced him from his home and made him come to this camp, where he endured humiliations. His hands were bound. \u201cThey attacked my honor. They told me my wife and daughters had been raped by ISIS. I was disgraced. I wanted to kill myself. \u201d Two weeks after the Bashiqa campaign began, President Barzani still hadn\u2019t given the order to attack the city itself. Rumors about what would be found in it expanded by the day. The number of ISIS fighters supposedly hiding out there crept upward. There would be no end of I. E. D. s, people said, of suicide   of snipers. There would be tunnels everywhere. At General Arif\u2019s camp, the berms had grown taller and the foxholes deeper. ISIS fighters had attacked by night, and by day they lobbed in mortar rounds and handcrafted missiles. Jamil Rashid spoke with a group of younger soldiers as gunfire rang out. \u201cThis is nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s air. I like the sound of it. \u201d Finally, the order was given. The night before the assault, Arif\u2019s troops gathered on the mountain above Bashiqa, in their old position. Ahmed and his cousin Ali were part of group of about 30 men who would descend the slope and enter Bashiqa on foot. In the morning, an armored column collected on a road outside the city. Sihad Barzani arrived to wish them luck. \u201cWe must move, but slowly,\u201d he said. For six hours, the column crept toward the city, while airstrikes and artillery pummeled it. As they waited, soldiers checked for news of the American election, the next day, on their phones. Word came down that a sniper was holed up somewhere inside. He had already killed one soldier and wounded four. On the access road into the city\u2019s east end, which climbed up the mountainside, the column drove by a pesh merga bulldozer in flames, the driver incinerated in the cab. As in Omar Qapchi, the streets were quiet. But as the vehicles turned by a small park, a   grenade flew at it. Its orange fireball and white smoke trail, visible for less than a second, were terribly beautiful. The rocket exploded against the low concrete wall of the park. Another quickly followed behind it. The column made it to a central plaza. A handsome old church with a suspicious tower was peppered with   fire and artillery. Jamil Rashid hopped from the front seat of a truck and took up a position outside the church. Standing in the open, his rifle dangling by his leg, he looked around and breathed in the scent of gun smoke, beaming. The column turned back along the same road it had entered. But now there was an empty white sedan in the middle of an intersection. Was this a car bomb? A roadblock? Had some innocent tried to flee and suffered a breakdown? The driver of the lead tank stuck his head from the turret hatch. A shot cracked the air, its tone higher and sharper than that of a Kalashnikov. Blood sprayed from the driver\u2019s head. He slumped over the turret. His crew mates began screaming and crying. Panic passed down the line. \u201cSniper! Sniper!\u201d The column reversed course, honking and   and labored back to the plaza. The tank sped from the city by a different route. At the staging point, the driver\u2019s body was lifted out and put in an ambulance. His friends bent over the tank\u2019s side skirt and knelt in the dirt, weeping. Before the driver was shot, Ahmed, Ali and their detachment had descended into the same side of the city on foot. They came under fire, retreated back uphill and took up a position. A   crack. Ali lurched forward, falling over Ahmed\u2019s leg. Ahmed thought his cousin had tripped. Then he saw the blood. Three days later, Ahmed was worrying a string of wooden prayer beads in a mosque in his and Ali\u2019s hometown, Rawanduz, in Kurdistan\u2019s eastern mountains. He sat by the muezzin, who sang a death prayer for Ali, a Quran open before him on a desk stand. Old pesh merga in traditional dress and younger ones in suits and jeans filed in. They greeted Ali\u2019s father and Ahmed, their hands to their chests, saying: \u201cMay he rest in peace\u201d and \u201cMay God forgive him his sins. \u201d After the service, long rugs were spread on the floor, and Ahmed and the men from his unit sat down to lunch. Their part in the fight against ISIS was over, for now. Bashiqa was liberated, and the Kurdish line stopped there.
