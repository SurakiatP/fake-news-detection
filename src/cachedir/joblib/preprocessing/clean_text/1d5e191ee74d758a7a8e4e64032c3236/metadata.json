The American attack on Syria on Thursday unraveled China\u2019s well laid plans for a summit meeting that would present President Xi Jinping as a global leader on par with President Trump, at once stealing the spotlight from Mr. Xi and putting him in a difficult position: choosing between condoning the kind of unilateral military action that China has long opposed, or rebuking his host. Mr. Xi\u2019s dilemma was also acute because China has generally sided with Russia in defending Syria\u2019s president, Bashar   and because it worries that Mr. Trump might be prepared to order a similar strike on North Korea, Chinese and Western analysts said. \u201cXi can\u2019t fail to be impressed by Trump\u2019s resolve,\u201d said Alan Dupont, an Australian military analyst who worked for that country\u2019s Defense Department. \u201cXi will have to reassess what the Trump presidency means for Chinese interests in East Asia, particularly North Korea and the South China Sea. \u201d The American strikes on Syria would quite likely make Mr. Xi be more amenable about the White House\u2019s demand that China squeeze North Korea\u2019s economy, analysts said. \u201cI suspect Xi will treat Trump\u2019s threat against North Korea as more serious than before this, provided the     language does not counteract it,\u201d said Douglas H. Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Beijing has long been fairly confident that the United States would not risk an attack on North Korea, a much more dangerous target than Syria because of its nuclear arsenal and its capacity to hit Japan and South Korea, two American allies, Chinese analysts said. But China\u2019s leaders are still trying to figure out Mr. Trump, and his quick decision to strike Syria may cause them to reconsider that assumption. At the same time, analysts said, China is unlikely to abandon North Korea as an ally and a strategic asset because it does not want to see a unified Korean Peninsula dominated by American troops. The first evening between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump looked warm and welcoming on Chinese   television, with lavish photographs of them chatting informally on an elegant sofa at    Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida club. The news shows also broadcast images of the two leaders sitting side by side at a vast dining table set with candelabra, and of Mr. Trump\u2019s    granddaughter, Arabella, singing in Chinese to Mr. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, before dinner. The Chinese reports approvingly noted that the granddaughter did a   performance, singing a Chinese song, \u201cJasmine,\u201d and reciting the \u201cThree Character Classic\u201d and some Tang poetry. Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Xi\u2019s invitation to visit China at an \u201cearly date,\u201d the   news agency Xinhua reported, a gesture that showed the two men had established the rapport that the Chinese leader was seeking to show his people at home. Then after dinner, with Mr. Xi safely back at his nearby hotel, Mr. Trump stepped to a podium to announce the strikes, making comments punctuated with emotional descriptions of the children killed by the Syrian government\u2019s chemical weapons attack. Mr. Trump informed Mr. Xi of the attack during dinner, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said in remarks to the news media on Friday afternoon. At the Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Friday, the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, noted China\u2019s opposition to the use of chemical weapons and added that it was necessary to seek a political solution in Syria. \u201cIt is imperative to prevent the further deterioration of the situation,\u201d she said. China has maintained a longstanding policy opposing unilateral military action. But Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to order the strikes at the very moment Mr. Xi was visiting inevitably put the focus on North Korea. In an interview last weekend before the talks with Mr. Xi, Mr. Trump told The Financial Times that he was prepared to take unilateral action against North Korea if China did not cooperate with the American goal of curbing the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Mr. Trump did not specify what kind of action he was considering. During his trip to East Asia last month, Mr. Tillerson said the United States might be forced to take   military action if the North Koreans \u201celevate the threat of their weapons program\u201d to an unacceptable level. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s action against Syria in the middle of Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, there was not an exact parallel between Syria and North Korea, said Jin Qiangyi, director of the Center for North and South Korea Studies at Yanbian University in Jilin Province, which borders North Korea. Syria does not possess the capacity to hit back after the missile strikes, but North Korea, with its arsenal of weaponry and its nuclear program, does, Mr. Jin said. \u201cThe North\u2019s nuclear capacity has reached such a level that any unilateral action from the U. S. would be extremely difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Americans have been saying a lot recently about attacking North Korea, but it is us who will be suffering from the consequences. \u201d The northeast area of China where Mr. Jin teaches has become increasingly fearful of radiation leaks from North Korea\u2019s nuclear operations. An attack by the United States would be \u201ccatastrophic for the region,\u201d he said. Another consequence for China of the Syrian attack could be an increase in the disaffection for North Korea among the population, and among those in the government and think tanks that consider the North a strategic liability. Beijing believes that the leader of North Korea, Kim   is insurance against a unified Korean Peninsula dominated by the American military. But a quiet debate has grown inside the Chinese government over the wisdom of hanging onto North Korea, an increasingly troublesome ally that functions because of China\u2019s largess. China supplies North Korea with almost all of the oil needed to keep its   economy afloat, and 90 percent of North Korean trade passes through China. Some Chinese companies trade with North Korea in contravention of United Nations sanctions. The White House is trying to persuade China that its support for the North is counterproductive, an argument that Mr. Trump was prepared to make to Mr. Xi during their talks, a senior administration official told reporters before the meeting. The Syrian strike could serve to make that point, but it would not be definitive in changing China\u2019s strategic thinking, said Andrei Lankov, a historian of North Korea who visits China. \u201cYes, North Korea is a liability for China,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the real world, the status quo is the least unpleasant option. \u201d If the talks with Mr. Trump on Friday go badly, Mr. Xi will be able to use the Syrian airstrikes against the American president by telling the Chinese people that they were the action of a weak leader, some Chinese analysts said. \u201cTrump is frustrated with his own critics,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cThis airstrike was a defensive measure to deal with criticism against him. The message from Xi to the Chinese public could be: \u2018This is Trump, you know he is not so good for China. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562106.5996735}
