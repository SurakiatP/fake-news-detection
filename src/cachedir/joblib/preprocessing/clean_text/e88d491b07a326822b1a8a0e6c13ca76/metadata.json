France, a prosperous country with the world\u2019s   economy, was depicted as a besieged wreck. In a packed hall here, she made a point, in an hourlong speech brimming with nationalist fervor, of praising President Trump and the Americans who had elected him, as her supporters shouted forcefully, \u201cThis is our country!\u201d Americans, she said, had \u201ckept faith with their national interest,\u201d even as she promised to do the same for France, saying the French had been \u201cdispossessed of their patriotism. \u201d Whether it will sell in a country undoubtedly frightened by terrorism and weary of unemployment hovering around 10 percent is unclear, but it is certain that Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front party is closer than it has ever been to gaining power in France after over 40 years of existence. Polls show that she is very likely to reach at least a second round of voting in France\u2019s   electoral process this spring. The weekend\u2019s campaigning in this prosperous southeastern metropolis  \u2014   her likely runoff opponent, Emmanuel Macron, the centrist former economy minister, also drew thousands to a rally across town on Saturday  \u2014   offered a taste of the fierce electoral battle to come and a rerun of some of the American election\u2019s dynamic. The populist Ms. Le Pen, 48, offered up a forbidding dystopia in urgent need of radical upheaval, much like Mr. Trump did. The boyish Mr. Macron  \u2014   he is 39 and has created a nonparty political movement that has suddenly caught fire  \u2014   spoke of \u201creconciling\u201d France and of \u201cworking together,\u201d and repeatedly addressed more than 10, 000 supporters in a giant stadium as \u201cmy friends. \u201d France would certainly stay in the European Union, in his view, and there would be none of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s war on globalization. The crowd spilled onto the grounds outside the stadium, forcing many to watch Mr. Macron on huge screens. He took a backhanded slap at Mr. Trump, promising refuge in enlightened France to American scientists, academics and companies \u201cfighting obscurantism\u201d at home. They would have, \u201cas of next May,\u201d the date of the presidential runoff, \u201ca homeland, and that will be France,\u201d Mr. Macron promised. The candidates both present themselves as outsiders  \u2014   Mr. Macron served in the Socialist government but is not a Socialist, while Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party has never held power  \u2014   but the crowds at the two rallies were a study in contrast. Judging by a   interviews, Mr. Macron\u2019s group was peppered with teachers, doctors, academics, civil servants and men who described themselves as \u201cheads of companies. \u201d In contrast, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s crowd was full of factory workers and former soldiers, and it adored her thundering opening line: \u201cI\u2019m against the Right of money, and the Left of money. I\u2019m the candidate of the people!\u201d Still, the slickly produced   National Front event at Lyon\u2019s modernist conference center, full of party functionaries in blazers scurrying about, showed how far the party has come from its disreputable ragtag origins in the early 1970s, when it emerged as a xenophobic coalition of former Nazi collaborators and disgruntled veterans of the Algerian war who had not forgiven the country\u2019s leaders for having agreed to Algeria\u2019s independence  \u2014   like Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father, the party\u2019s founder,   Le Pen. She has effectively kicked him out of the party. But Ms. Le Pen\u2019s populist tirade echoed with many of the former patriarch\u2019s themes. She delivered her speech against a screen projecting the words \u201cIn the Name of the People,\u201d and it was full of immigrants committing crimes, jihadists plotting attacks and European Union bureaucrats stealing jobs from the French. Ms. Le Pen promised to crack down on all of them. Clearly buoyed by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory after years of electoral defeats in France  \u2014   \u201cThe impossible becomes the possible,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said of it  \u2014   she offered a sketch of what her presidency might look like. She promised to hold a referendum within six months on European Union membership, which she called a \u201cnightmare,\u201d secure the country\u2019s borders and pull France out of NATO. Foreigners, she said, were eating up France\u2019s social benefits and offering little in return. \u201cOur benefits are distributed to people all over the world,\u201d she said. But in contrast to Mr. Trump, for Ms. Le Pen restoring what she called \u201csovereignty\u201d to France appeared as an end in itself. She offered no return to a golden age of prosperity for her country, promising instead to \u201crestore order\u201d within five years. Ruin was just around the corner, in her telling. \u201cAfter decades of cowardice and   our choice is a choice of civilization,\u201d she said. \u201cWill our children live in a country that is still French and democratic?\u201d The crowd ate it up. \u201cShe\u2019s got a real program, in the name of the people, for the workers, and by the workers,\u201d said Eric Fusis, a    retired military officer from the Doubs. \u201cIt\u2019s for the nation, and not for the financial sector and the banks,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562738.5205157}
