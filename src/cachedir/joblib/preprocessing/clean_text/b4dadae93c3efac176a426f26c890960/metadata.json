Alongside the image is an insert of a smiling Trump.  The taglines for the mock  include \u201cThe finest in \u201d \u201cThe world\u2019s greatest really,\u201d and \u201cCooked up by five star chef James Mattis. \u201d  A telephone number displayed on one of the billboards apparently connects to an art gallery in Beverly Hills. The posters\u2019 appearance in Los Angeles comes as hostilities between the United States and North Korea have hit renewed heights in recent weeks. NBC News reported that the National Security Council presented military options to President Trump  \u2014   including the possible assassination  of the North Korean dictator  \u2014   to deal with the country\u2019s increasingly defiant nuclear program ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week.  Sabo has previously featured images of Trump in his street art. In November, just after Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election, the street artist peppered Los   bus benches with fake  for Sotheby\u2019s real estate sales, in a campaign lampooning numerous celebrities\u2019 pledges to move out of the country if Trump were elected. Most recently, the artist trolled the Academy Awards by erecting posters outside the Dolby Theater in Hollywood that blasted the film industry\u2019s \u201cunwatchable movies. \u201d Sabo has also skewered Hillary Clinton, at one time placing an image of the former Democratic presidential candidate inside a washing machine as part of a \u201cmoney laundering\u201d series, alongside an image of actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
