[The whiny, crybaby brigade of Democrats in leadership, who wield unchecked power over the most populous, and in many ways, the most significant state.  California Democrats doubled down this week \u2014  hiring former US Attorney General Eric Holder to go on offense against the policies of the incoming White House.   Trump should engage California\u2019s petulant leaders in much the same way \u2014  \u201cpick a fight. \u201d Ignoring California in hopes that it will go away would be a disastrous mistake.  California is far too important to the national security of the United States to simply ignore it. In spite of the   water crisis that has devastated the world\u2019s \u201cfood basket,\u201d (the San Joaquin Valley) California still supplies a majority of US agricultural products for export.  Grapes, citrus, almonds \u2014  yes, fruits and nuts \u2014  (no surprise here) \u2014  in addition to beef, poultry, dairy, tomatoes, all manner of vegetables, alfalfa, wine, cotton  \u2026    to name a few. Water wars between federal and state regulators, environmentalists, the Democrat governor, the   state legislature, and farmers have gone on for decades with devastating results.  Much of the world\u2019s most fertile farmland lies fallow, as groundwater, its lifeblood, is slowly siphoned off to keep farmers alive.   Trump has already wisely tapped a few leaders from the crucial Central Valley region, which is not only known for its agriculture but is also home to vast quantities of domestic oil sitting atop the massive Monterey Shale. Both food and energy security are critical to the security of a nation. So far the new president\u2019s appointment to EPA, Scott Pruitt, bodes well for California.  A \u201c  skeptic,\u201d Pruitt will loathe to ruining the economy in the name of \u201cfake science,\u201d and could be the best friend California farmers have had in decades.  Any relief from California\u2019s crushing \u201cclimate change\u201d regulations \u2014   affecting everything from regulating dust kicked up by tractors, to requiring dairy farmers to capture cow flatulence \u2014  could be a windfall for this persecuted industry. And if the EPA took a balanced approach to the Endangered Species Act, weighing food production against the life of one tiny, insignificant, bait fish \u2014  the Delta Smelt \u2014  which has become the proxy for the environmentalist activists who populate the bureaucracies at both the federal and state level, water would once again flow to the San Joaquin Valley. An old saying \u2014  \u201cWhiskey\u2019s for drinking, water\u2019s for fighting. \u201d \u2014  has been true for far too long. But water\u2019s not the only thing hanging in the balance. Land use is a massive issue all over the West. The Federal Government claims ownership of almost 50% of California\u2019s land \u2014  a source of constant harassment for ranchers, loggers and anyone trying to operate a business in or around the land controlled by BLM, US Forest Services, and other federal agencies.  Picking a Representative from a western state like Ryan Zinke of Montana, as the nominee for Secretary of the Interior was another brilliant move. But the biggest issue that Mr. Trump raised in his campaign by far \u2014  and the one that is front and center in the showdown with the California Democrat monopoly \u2014  is immigration. What a President Trump does on immigration affects California\u2019s 38 million people more than any other state. California officials have declared California to be a \u201csanctuary\u201d from any enforcement of federal immigration laws, and are defying the new president by refusing to cooperate with immigration officials in any way \u2014  preferring to dump criminal aliens on the streets so they can terrorize citizens rather than hand them over for deportation. Since immigration is one of the specifically enumerated duties of the Federal Government, this is the fight you need to pick, Mr. President. A few action items to consider: The future for millions of Californians is in your hands, Mr. President. Will you engage and fight this battle and win a victory for the American people or punt like every administration before you? The world is watching.
