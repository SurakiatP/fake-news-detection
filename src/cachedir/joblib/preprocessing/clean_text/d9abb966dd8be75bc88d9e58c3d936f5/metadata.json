Click to enlarge \\nIt was the rain that should have told us. High-altitude jets had flown over Aleppo the previous evening and, just occasionally, we heard their bombs exploding, far away in the countryside beyond the city. Then a soft, warm shower drifted over the ruins downtown and coated the streets and apartment blocks of western Aleppo with drizzle, and there was \u2013 for this city, at least \u2013 a strange silence. Dawn brought a brown, overcast sky through which no Russian or Syrian pilots could see the ground unless they chose to fly at low level through the downpour, which they never do. \\nAnd that was when the bombardment of western Aleppo began. The mortars and shells broke across the city in a steady and growing rumble of sound that left only one question in our minds. Amid the ruins of eastern Aleppo, with its tens of thousands of trapped civilians, where on earth did its few thousand largely Islamist fighters, get all this ammunition? Syrian army long-range artillery, high on the hill behind the old Meridien hotel, banged away at the eastern horizon where smudges of grey smoke began to curl into the dun-coloured sky. \\nIt was not quite the storm of steel that the media \u2013 many in far-away Beirut \u2013 would have the world believe. The battle for divided Aleppo has been fought for too long and its people besieged and then rebesieged \u2013 in both east and west \u2013 that the front lines have congealed into the square miles of dust and ruins that are now almost impassable. You might join the chorus of exaggeration about Srebrenica or Grozny, but Stalingrad this is not. \\nYet it shook both the civilians and the regime in the west of the city. Just after breakfast, as I was gazing eastwards through the rain towards the ancient citadel, there was a sudden clap of sound as a shell bashed into the governor\u2019s modern office block. I saw bits of the side of the building flying into the air. The Aleppo governor, whose residence is itself sealed off by anti-car-bomb concrete barricades, was safe in Damascus where he was meeting Bashar al-Assad and other regional leaders. Others were not so fortunate. \\nBy midday, Syrian radio was announcing seven dead \u2013 a little, almost insignificant figure when you remember the new graves in the packed cemeteries of this place \u2013 but the bombardment had a dramatic effect in the streets. The loudspeaker on the minaret of a mosque scarcely 100 yards away clicked \u2013 the electrical \u201cclick\u201d and hiss of the sound system is the prelude to every supercharged prayer across the Middle East \u2013 and a voice shouted: \u201cThey are attacking. They are attacking. They are coming from the north, from Zahra, from Bin Yamin and towards al-Hamadaniyeh.\u201d \\nAnd this was the first indication anyone in the streets was given that the incoming fire was not only arriving from eastern Aleppo but from south-west of the city, from the fields and ruined factories and broken sewage farms where Nusra and some of its Islamist allies still hold territory that snakes all the way north to the Turkish frontier \u2013 from which weapons regularly arrive to increase this feast of violence. \\nWars inspire their own Hollywood version of reality and, in a darkened Ba\u2019ath party headquarters with the rumble of explosions outside, I was to hear another rumour of war that will surely acquire its own mystique in the days to come. American planes had been seen dropping arms supplies into eastern Aleppo, Syrian jets had warned them off but some parachutes had been seen. \u201cI think there is a video,\u201d an otherwise extremely rational and intelligent official added. \\nThere was, of course, no video \u2013 there never is \u2013 nor are Syrian MiGs in any position to challenge US air power. Washington is not going to provoke Russia by sending its fighter-bombers from Turkey over Aleppo. Besides, given the American propensity for inaccuracy, any parachutes would surely have missed their target. \\nSource Comment \u2014 Oct 31, 2016 Robert Fisk\u2019s dismissal of claims that the U.S. was dropping arms supplies into eastern Aleppo calls into question his objectivity as a journalist. For we know from earlier reports that the U.S. and its allies are alleged to have supplied Syrian \u201copposition fighters\u201d by parachute drops . For example last October Reuters was reporting that the U.S. was airdropping supplies to \u201cSyrian rebels\u201d in northern Syria. More recent reports allege that the U.S. was \u201cconsidering arming\u201d CIA backed fighters with anti-aircraft weapons. So why is Robert Fisk so quick to dismiss these claims without investigating them?'"}, "time": 1742561874.225925}
