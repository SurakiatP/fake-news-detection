[Said Hoekstra on Trump firing Comey, Democrats \u201care now in a very awkward position. They have a President that they don\u2019t like who did exactly what they wish their president, President Obama, had done months ago and that is fire James Comey. And now it\u2019s kind of like, well, what are we supposed to do now? How are we supposed to react to this?\u201d  Hoekstra continued to mock the Democrats, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t like anything that Donald Trump does. That\u2019s our standard operating procedure and he\u2019s now done exactly what we\u2019ve been asking for for months. So, we have to now come up with a rationale why we don\u2019t like this decision and why all of a sudden James Comey is our hero. \u201d Hoekstra also said he felt Comey had become a distraction for the FBI and a liability to its reputation and the firing was appropriate. He also said Obama would have fired Comey before Hillary Clinton took office had she won in November, allowing her to pick her own director.
