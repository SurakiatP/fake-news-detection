Evidence of their godless agenda was on full display during the Democratic National convention, when they removed all references to God. It should come as no surprise\u00c2 what Hillary was caught doing at a campaign event, which clearly\u00c2 solidifies the true evil nature of the Democratic Party. \\nLike it or not, our country was founded on Christian principles. \u201cIn God we trust\u201d is not only printed on all of our currency, but references to God are\u00c2 throughout the Constitution, as our Founding Fathers intertwined their faith with our founding documents. Liberals loathe this fact,\u00c2 and many have made it their life mission to erase God from everything in our country, as evidenced by their constant barrage on our faith. \\nAt a Democratic presidential rally in May, one of Hillary\u2019s little evil minions took the stage to introduce Hillary to the crowd. But when the unnamed woman began using lines of our\u00c2 Pledge of Allegiance to weave with\u00c2 her pro-Hillary rhetoric, she decided to omit two little words, as a blatant slap in the face to God. \\n\u00e2\\x80\\x9cOnly Hillary can bring us together as one nation\u00e2\\x80\u015a Und\u00e2\\x80\u015a Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,\u00e2\\x80\\x9d the woman said, while partially quoting the US Pledge of Allegiance. \\nThis demented woman intentionally removed \u201cunder God\u201d from our nation\u2019s pledge, but how Hillary reacted was even more disturbing, as she immediately begins to nod and smile in\u00c2 agreement of this woman\u2019s omission. Watch her choke on \"Under God\"&\"indivisible\" \\n\u2014 NEEDY\u0111\\x9f\\x92\\x97Latina4Trump (@tteegar) October 25, 2016 \\nHow sickening.\u00c2 Liberals will not be fully satisfied until they completely destroy our country with their vile agenda. If Hillary gets elected, we\u2019ll soon have the most godless and corrupt person on the planet driving our country even further down\u00c2 the path of\u00c2 darkness and destruction. \\nAt this point in our nation\u2019s history, it\u2019s imperative that we don\u2019t just sit idly by and allow these things to go on. We have to get loud and aggressively fight back when we see darkness slipping in, whether that be at our children\u2019s schools, in our government, or\u00c2 in our presidential candidates.'"}, "time": 1742562643.1157002}
