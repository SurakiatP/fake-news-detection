At 19, she began working there as a stagehand, typically the only female member in a   crew. Now, at 34, she has made history, becoming the first female head carpenter of Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The local\u2019s 3, 351 members work in spaces from the Met to Carnegie Hall, at Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden, and in every Broadway theater  \u2014   including the Walter Kerr, which is where she was one morning in September, overseeing the   for the musical \u201cFalsettos. \u201d With a head of thick dark curls and a ready smile, Ms. Diaz is a   tomboy, a blend of   authority and quiet confidence. \u201cMy name has a lot of clout in this business,\u201d she said. \u201cI have people on my side and in my pocket I can turn to. \u201d She works in a   shirt, shorts and sturdy sneakers, a delicate silver necklace barely visible. Married to a fellow Local 1 stagehand, she sports a tattooed wedding ring in place of a traditional metal band, the   of her ring finger worn clean from years of ungloved manual labor. Standing on the shallow stage of the Kerr, she kept a close eye on the crew of stagehands, all of them men. As heavy objects thumped and banged, it was her job to keep everyone safe  \u2014   while not alienating those who work for her. And with her many close ties within Local 1, it\u2019s a balancing act. \u201cSee those two guys?\u201d she said, pointing to a burly pair wrangling a chain motor. \u201cThey\u2019re brothers  \u2014   and one of them is married to one of my cousins. \u201d No longer working for an hourly rate, typical of   positions, Ms. Diaz is now a   staff employee of Jujamcyn Theaters. (Before her promotion, she would often work a   schedule at the Cort Theater on Broadway, then head uptown for the night shift at the opera house, a total of at least 72 hours each week.) Despite breaking the glass ceiling, Ms. Diaz is typical of backstage workers at prominent New York theaters in other regards. As David Grindle, executive director of the United States Institute for Theater Technology, a national trade group, pointed out, \u201cEverything in this industry is based on relationships. \u201d Her new job title is somewhat misleading, as she no longer wields a hammer or saw her role is now more administrative and managerial. \u201cI point and do payroll,\u201d she joked. Still, even as an industry veteran, she said she was \u201ctotally surprised\u201d when asked to compete with 12 others in applying for the job, and \u201cterrified\u201d of a formal interview. Ms. Diaz brought specific technical skills to the position, having worked with a similar rigging system at the Cort. She now acts as the intermediary between her employers and the mostly male stagehands she hires. \u201cI have to make sure that all things in the house are safe,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf wood gets chipped or a curtain gets torn, it\u2019s my job to make sure we restore it. I\u2019m responsible to make sure the Walter Kerr stays intact, that everyone working here is happy and healthy. \u201d Local 1, with only 189 female members, is widely considered the most prestigious local in the country and, industry veterans agree, one of the most difficult to join. There are three ways in: earning $35, 000 a year for three consecutive years in a qualifying union job unionizing your own workplace or taking a skills assessment test to qualify for an apprentice position lasting two to three years. The work, while not always steady, can be lucrative, paying up to $80, 000 a year, plus benefits. Ms. Diaz\u2019s   network is typical of the union, where many members are married to one another or related by blood. \u201cIt makes a huge difference having family in the business,\u201d said Kristina Miller, a veteran stagehand and Local 1 member who has known Ms. Diaz for more than a decade. When stagehands are being hired, a familiar last name makes a big difference. \u201cIt\u2019s nepotism,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cYou\u2019re    \u2019s kid, not just some Joe Smith. Absolutely, I\u2019ll give you work. \u201d Besides her father, John Diaz, Ms. Diaz\u2019s older brother, Michael Diaz, is also in the business, as head carpenter of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. \u201cBackstage is a   occupation,\u201d Michael Diaz explained by email. \u201cThe head carpenter is the head of the heads, and when 90 percent of the people you\u2019re overseeing are men, and probably much older then Jen, one has to look them in the eye and say \u2018Do your work\u2019 in a way that inspires them and not complain about how they were spoken to. \u201d Accustomed to being \u201cthe only girl in the building,\u201d Ms. Diaz said she\u2019s used to it: \u201cI can honestly say I have no friends who are girls. \u201d Ms. Diaz changed colleges three times before graduating from Rutgers University with a degree in psychology. She\u2019d hoped to become a music teacher \u201cbecause it gave me such joy,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to share that. \u201d But understanding psychology \u201chas come in handy more times than I count,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone\u2019s acting a certain way, at least I know it\u2019s not me. \u201d Keeping a cool head is essential, fellow stagehands agree. Ms. Miller said that being \u201cstubborn\u201d and \u201cpigheaded\u201d has helped her thrive in workplaces where foul language is standard. Acquiring the technical and mathematical knowledge for Ms. Diaz\u2019s current job required years of hard physical labor and demands a sensitive managerial style and the ability to juggle the sometimes competing needs  \u2014   for speed and safety  \u2014   of her employers and her hired hands. Stagehands and flymen wrestle enormous pieces of metal and steel, with each show\u2019s costly, carefully designed sets usually shipping in from studios in Connecticut and upstate New York. Nine of Broadway\u2019s theaters, those built between 1903 and 1927, are \u201chemp houses,\u201d using manila ropes to set the stage. A hemp fly system is the simplest type, and stage rigging techniques draw largely from ship rigging. Backstage in a hemp house sounds like a ship the stage is referred to as a deck, and words used include batten, belay, block, bo\u2019sun, hitch and lanyard. \u201cThe ability to rig in a hemp house is a dying art,\u201d Ms. Diaz said. \u201cI call it \u2018art\u2019 because there\u2019s nothing in the air when you start the  . The first day, it\u2019s a complete blank slate to put whatever you want wherever you want. You have the most versatility, but also the most work. \u201d Safety is her primary concern. \u201cOne short cut or misstep can lead to you loosening a pipe and really hurting people. \u201d \u201cMy first accident was when a house ran over my foot,\u201d she said. The house, a   prop for \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d at the Met Opera, left a huge contusion. \u201cI was out for the rest of the season,\u201d she recalled. In her downtime, she listens to music (the Cure is a favorite) but she\u2019s had little of that. Having worked two jobs last year, she admitted that she gained weight from a lack of sleep and exercise. And what of the romance of the theater, the hush of anticipation as the lights dim, the orchestra begins to play and the curtain rises? \u201cI saw \u2018Cats\u2019 in 1989 I vaguely remember that,\u201d Ms. Diaz said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t been to a show in a long time. I\u2019m here enough!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563644.6017745}
