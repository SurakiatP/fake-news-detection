Here are six more over-hyped figures revered by leftists who always get everything wrong.\\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt \\nHow the world remembers: FDR led America through the Great Depression and WWII, remembered fondly by seniors who heard his inspiring fireside chats.\\nThe ugly truth: Some economists argue that FDR\u2019s measures prolonged the Great Depression . All the New Deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional, except Social Security. He got the Supreme Court to back off by threatening to pack the Court with more members with views to his liking. That restrained their judicial opinion, though the Constitution doesn\u2019t grant Congress the power to create a Federal retirement system.\\nSocial Security works\u2014though it\u2019s slim pickings if it\u2019s a retiree\u2019s only income\u2014and for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting Congressional overspending . However, the aging Baby Boomers who didn\u2019t have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross. Further, the Social Security Number is now a de-facto universal ID number; a convenient database field for monitoring citizens . America\u2019s Founding Fathers would have been appalled at today\u2019s domestic spying , and the Soviet dictators of old would have wept with envy.\\nFDR pledged to keep the USA out of WWII . Meanwhile, he quietly did everything possible to antagonize Japan, a once-friendly nation, such as (among several items) freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply. When he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor, he didn\u2019t order the base to be locked and loaded.\\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough: So nearly a quarter million Americans died in battle, but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to \u201cmake the world safe for democracy\u201d, right? Unfortunately, FDR was far too friendly with the USSR, giving them nearly $11 billion in food, weaponry, and other supplies (about $119 billion adjusted for inflation).\\nAt the Yalta conference, FDR agreed to let \u201cUncle Joe\u201d Stalin take over Eastern Europe. General Patton wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from Soviet tyranny, but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out . When the Iron Curtain rose and the Cold War began, Winston Churchill said, \u201cWe slaughtered the wrong pig.\u201d If only Roosevelt had listened to his generals!\\nFDR wasn\u2019t a Communist, but many of his appointees and trusted advisers were. Later, Joseph McCarthy barely scratched the surface trying to get rid of them.\\nWalter Cronkite \\nHow the world remembers: He was a long-time CBS anchorman, reporting many triumphs and tragedies. A friendly face on living room TVs for decades, he became everyone\u2019s \u201cUncle Walter\u201d. According to polls, he was the \u201cmost trusted man in America\u201d.\\nThe ugly truth: Although a decent fellow in person, Cronkite was the archetypal big-name liberal journalist , spinning the news for decades. Sometimes it was rather subliminal, including his signature subtle sneer. Most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truth-tellers; as Cronkite\u2019s tagline went, \u201cAnd that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\\nUntil Cronkite\u2019s late career, the mainstream media had a veneer of respectability\u2014perhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard, but a veneer nonetheless. There once were only three American corporate TV networks. From Manhattan, they were the public\u2019s information gatekeepers; no other broadcast news (besides shortwave radio) was available. Baby Boomer liberals might get a bit misty-eyed remembering those days. Today, six mega-conglomerates own 90% of the media, but at least the Internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters .\\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough : His biggest whopper was about the Tet Offensive. The Viet Cong launched a desperate all-out assault, suffered very heavy losses, mostly it was over within a day, and ultimately the VC gained no territory. However, \u201cthe most trusted man in America\u201d gave them a propaganda victory, reporting that the Vietnam War was hopeless. Public opinion promptly turned against the war. Ho Chi Minh should\u2019ve given Cronkite a medal, an honorary VC generalship, and a dozen roses.\\nMany forget that the 1973 Paris Accords brought peace. Two years later, though, the shaky Ford administration couldn\u2019t persuade Congress to respond appropriately to a Shit Test by North Vietnam. Then they invaded, and Saigon fell. All that\u2019s a long story, but public opinion from biased reporting certainly didn\u2019t help. That affected America\u2019s prestige abroad, along with the lives of millions of South Vietnamese killed or sent to \u201creeducation camps\u201d .\\nAllen Ginsberg \\nHow the world remembers: He was a pioneer of the beatniks, much beloved by the hippies who followed, and lauded with several literary prizes. Some even credit him with basically starting the 1960s counterculture singlehandedly.\\nThe ugly truth: Ginsberg was neurotic and a degenerate. He wrote a so-called poem about his sphincter (yes, really) but the rest isn\u2019t much better. Anyone considering his bathroom wall ravings as \u201cprofound\u201d either is educated beyond his ability to comprehend, believed the hype and didn\u2019t read it, or dropped too much acid.\\n\u201cHowl\u201d, his best-known poem, begins \u201cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness\u201d. A brief excerpt (get some brain bleach) describing these \u201cbest minds\u201d:\\nwho burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism,\\nwho distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,\\nwho broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,\\nwho bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,\\nwho howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,\\nwho let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,\\nwho blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,\\nwho balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may, \u2026\\nEven overlooking the lunacy, buggery, and butthurt, Ginsberg\u2019s \u201cfree verse\u201d is stylistically lazy. Back when poetry meant Keats and Kipling, it rhymed and had meter.\\nHe was a noted critic of the USA, for example:\\nAmerica, I used to be a communist when I was a kid I\u2019m not sorry\\nGinsberg visited several Communist countries, getting himself deported from some of them for immorality. He abandoned his ancestral faith for Buddhism and had a Hare Krishna phase. What people believe is up to them, of course, but adding these two things up\u2014along with his wretched poetry\u2014reveals a tortured soul. Rejecting everything one belongs to is childish rebellion for rebellion\u2019s sake.\\nGranted, Ginsberg\u2019s popularity was greatest during the screwed-up \u201ckill your parents\u201d 1960s. Still, what were those who promoted his crapulous drivel smoking? Were the literary gatekeepers pushing cultural Marxism running out of talented writers?\\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough: Ginsberg joined the North American Man/Boy Love Association, sometimes speaking kindly on their behalf. Explaining in an accurately titled interview\u2014\u201cPolitics, Pederasty and Consciousness\u201d\u2014to the Harvard Crimson :\\nAs I get older, having very specialised sexual tastes, it gets harder to make out\u2026 I like young boys. Why?\u2026 I\u2019d have more chance at making out with younger guys if I were younger, dewier, dewy-limbed.\\nThe media usually portrays pickup artists as reprobates, and screeched about Donald Trump\u2019s years-old private locker room talk, but the presstitutes (likewise the lefty \u201cintelligentsia\u201d) fawningly praised Ginsberg despite his appetite for young boys .\\nTed Kennedy Best friends forever, east and west\\nHow the world remembers: He was \u201cthe Lion of the Senate\u201d, representing Massachusetts from 1962 until his death in 2009. This champion of social justice carried on the Kennedy legacy\u2014hailed as America\u2019s nobility\u2014after his two brothers were tragically slain.\\nThe ugly truth: He was as passionate for booze and adultery as he was for social justice, but the suckers kept reelecting him. His lack of character sank way deeper, though; all the way underwater.\\nAfter a night of partying on Chappaquiddick Island, Ted Kennedy drove off a bridge. He escaped, but failed to help his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Per one of the investigators, she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours. If he\u2019d ran to a nearby house for help\u2014rather than waiting nine hours to sober up\u2014she would\u2019ve survived. He got a two month suspended sentence, barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter. The judge basically said poor Teddy had suffered enough. (What about how Miss Kopechne suffered?) There\u2019s one set of rules for the elites , and another for us. Shortly thereafter, he tried to spin-doctor it with a \u201cwoe is me\u201d shtick. The suckers kept reelecting him, though a Presidential bid was now beyond reach.\\nAs for his many legislative actions, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was the most notorious. He promised the public :\\nFirst, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same\u2026 Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset\u2026 Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia\u2026. In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think\u2026 The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs .\\nThe \u201cLion of the Senate\u201d was lyin\u2019 his fat ass off! This population replacement policy threatens America\u2019s future , just as the Coudenhove-Kalergi Plan is doing in Europe. Still, the suckers kept reelecting him.\\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough: Besides giving away the country to which the Constitution granted \u201cthe Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity \u201c, Lyin\u2019 Ted was in cahoots with the KGB . He proposed to help his Soviet pal Yuri Andropov with tidying up the USSR\u2019s image problem during the Cold War\u2019s endgame. The damning documents suggested that Walter Cronkite (see above) and Barbara Walters might be used for this effort. Conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on Communism; little did they know how cozy Ted Kennedy was in bed with Comrade Andropov.\\nJohn Lennon \\nHow the world remembers: He was a talented musician, arguably the most prominent of the Beatles. Their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame. Lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play. He\u2019s remembered as a wonderful man, an embodiment of the 1960s (the good parts , anyway), and the conscience of the world.\\nThe ugly truth: Despite Lennon\u2019s considerable talents, not all his songs were excellent. Things slipped with the White Album . (\u201cRevolution 9\u201d, really?) After the Beatles broke up, he started a solo career, often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses. His last album produced during his life\u2014after dragging himself out of a long heroin stupor\u2014was Double Fantasy . Critics at first agreed that it sucked. After a nut shot Lennon, they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliant.\\nLennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics. Granted, everyone has a right to their opinion, but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise. His song \u201cImagine\u201d is particularly telling. As he put it:\\nImagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,\u2019 is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I\u2019m not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.\\nBeing under the shadow of the Berlin Wall back in their bar gig days should\u2019ve precluded sophomoric posturing like this.\\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough: His failings are quite troubling, too numerous to fully detail. One item is abandoning his family the way his own father did. A truly wonderful man wouldn\u2019t do that.\\nAnother item was his extensive substance abuse. He spent 1974 guzzling booze, his \u201clost weekend\u201d. One night, a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head. Then:\\nLennon: \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\\nWaitress: \u201cYeah, you\u2019re some asshole with a Kotex on his forehead.\u201d\\nOne Lennon biographer asked Timothy Leary, who\u2019d been on hundreds of acid trips, what Lennon\u2019s extreme LSD consumption would do. Leary had no idea! Finally, what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician, much beloved by the public, to get himself strung out on heroin?\\nJimmy Carter In this heart-warming scene, Jimmy Carter and Uncle Fidel stand for the Cuban national anthem in Havana\\nHow the world remembers: Carter is praised as a rare honest politician, exemplifying Christian principles and tolerance.\\nThe ugly truth: The economy tanked during the Carter administration: double-digit inflation and high unemployment. Economists are still puzzled by stagflation; normally, unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated. At least Obama gave economists another data point to study.\\nCarter\u2019s commendably not corrupt, but exemplified bleeding-hearted liberalism. Despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize for not being George W. Bush (likewise Al Gore and The Lightworker), Carter was a lackluster embarrassment. He was known for TMI statements, for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart (at least Clinton had the balls to do it for real). He ranked lower than Mr. Whipple on a face recognition survey. The Boston Globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline \u201cMore Mush From the Wimp\u201d; finally journalists got something right.\\nCarter\u2019s shining foreign policy moment was the Camp David Accords, establishing peace between Egypt and Israel. America started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace, which ironically supplies their military. Why? The USA wasn\u2019t even a combatant, aside from the USS Liberty incident which certainly shouldn\u2019t inspire American tribute money. Taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racket.\\nWorse, he badly bungled the Iran hostage crisis. One Iranian official later stated they would\u2019ve released the hostages if the USA had threatened force in the beginning. Yep, Carter failed Iran\u2019s Shit Test. Consequentially, the USA lost tons of international prestige, and the ordeal of the hostages dragged on unnecessarily.\\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough: Carter is often a little too cordial with notorious dictators . Worse, Clinton trusted him to represent the USA during disarmament talks with North Korea. They gave him the Potemkin village show; he bought it hook, line, and sinker. Yet again, Carter was played for a chump\u2014the USA opened its wallet and gave North Korea aid, and they pinky-swore to stop their nuclear program. Now the Norks have nukes\u2014surprise! Awesome job, Mister Nice Guy!\\n\\nRead More: The Ugly Truth Of Leftist \u201cHeroes\u201d \\n'"}, "time": 1742562271.6607661}
