The complex is like an airy, marbled museum, with reminders, maybe every 10 steps, that the Cowboys once were a dynasty: Super Bowl rings, Super Bowl trophies and hagiographic displays of all five of the franchise\u2019s Super Bowl victories. But the shiniest part of the Cowboys these days was not in the complex\u2019s blueprints: It\u2019s Dak Prescott, who came out of nowhere to become the team\u2019s new franchise quarterback. Prescott, a rookie drafted in the fourth round out of Mississippi State, led the team to 11 victories in a row before Sunday\u2019s visit to New Jersey to face the Giants, a feat that not even Troy Aikman or Roger Staubach can claim. But in a visit to Frisco last week, it became even more clear how much Prescott\u2019s ascent, like the team\u2019s gleaming new home, is yet another reminder of one man the Cowboys have left behind: Tony Romo. \u201cI know he wants to play and I know he wants to be out there, but he\u2019s been really good about everything,\u201d Prescott said of Romo. \u201cHe\u2019s telling me about   and things he sees with a defense, or things he has seen in the past. He\u2019s great. \u201d The Great Tony Romo? You\u2019ll have to think back a while to remember how great. Romo was the undrafted rookie who became a Pro Bowl player, leading the Cowboys to four playoff berths and posting only two losing seasons after taking over as the starter in 2006. But while his career propelled the Cowboys forward year after year, it is also sometimes remembered for what Romo did not do when it mattered most. There was the botched hold on a   attempt that probably cost the Cowboys a chance for a playoff win at Seattle in 2007. The loss to the Giants in the postseason a year later that spoiled a   season. The    fades. The poorly thrown balls and the dozens of sacks. And then there were the injuries, which continue to thwart him. Prescott is starting at all only because Romo broke a bone in his back in the preseason  \u2014   after his 2015 season ended early, to boot. Now Romo, 36, is stuck in a position that\u2019s dreaded by every top athlete who knows the clock is ticking on his career: He\u2019s watching the young Prescott lead the greatest Cowboys team in years to the playoffs, and knowing that wherever they go, he will only be along for the ride. \u201cHe\u2019s earned the right to be our quarterback, as hard as it is for me to say,\u201d Romo said of Prescott in what amounted to an official concession speech last month. \u201cWhat is clear is that I was that kid once. \u201d When Romo was that kid, it was all so much fun. He sang Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d at his locker, and he joked with the reporters who scribbled down his every word. Even when he was injured, he would brush off his physical problems because he was absolutely positive that he would come back, even better than ever. Most of the time, he was right. \u201cWhen things don\u2019t go your way,\u201d he once told me, \u201cyou just have to come right back and say: \u2018Let\u2019s try this again. Let\u2019s have some fun. \u2019\u201d Romo doesn\u2019t look as if he\u2019s having any fun now. The black vinyl seat at his locker was empty when I visited Texas last week. Next to it was a pile of papers with information about the Giants, and how the Cowboys would match up. Romo had scribbled notes in the margins, knowing full well that it was unlikely that he would play. He doesn\u2019t need to talk with reporters, and so, generally, he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a jarring change. When I covered the Cowboys for The Dallas Morning News in 2003, just after Romo was signed as a rookie free agent, I could always find him on the blue leather couches in the locker room, a motivational book in hand, the dimple on his left cheek showing because he was nearly always smiling. For three seasons, Romo sat and watched the Cowboys burn through quarterback after quarterback: Quincy Carter, Drew Henson, Vinny Testaverde, Drew Bledsoe. Romo, a friendly son of Wisconsin, seemed to know his time would come. And just like that, midway through the 2006 season, it did. He came in for Bledsoe against the Giants, and he never looked back. O. K. that\u2019s an exaggeration. He\u2019s probably looking back now. And who would blame him for being nostalgic? Now likely closer to his 40th birthday than he is to starting in a Super Bowl, he must wonder if he will ever take a snap for the Cowboys  \u2014   for anyone  \u2014   again. Others on the team must be wondering the same thing, though they won\u2019t admit it. \u201cI want to do what gives us the best chance to have Tony contribute to a championship,\u201d the owner Jerry Jones said on his radio show last week. \u201cTony\u2019s ready to go Tony\u2019s not done,\u201d said Scott Linehan, the Cowboys\u2019 offensive coordinator. Tight end Jason Witten, Romo\u2019s close friend and his favorite receiver, struggled to even consider the idea that Romo might never throw him another pass. He fidgeted as he considered his answer and admitted that he didn\u2019t really want to give one. He and Romo were rookies together. They became the franchise players together. They even became fathers at about the same time. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of grown up together and went from being kids to being men at the same time,\u201d Witten said. \u201cI know that Tony\u2019s always going to be the same guy, no matter what situation he\u2019s dealing with, and I also believe he can still get it done on the field. \u201d He paused for a moment before adding, \u201cBut this game doesn\u2019t slow down for anybody, and Tony understands that. \u201d Walking through the locker room in Frisco on Thursday, Romo looked less like an N. F. L. starter and more like someone who had just rolled out of bed. Tousled hair. Unshaven face. Baggy sweatpants. Head down and silent. Across the room, Prescott engaged a crowd of reporters. He is now the star of the show.'"}, "time": 1742564615.8135374}
