The owner, Louis Barbati, 61, had been an institution at LB Spumoni Gardens, the restaurant started by his grandfather, an Italian immigrant who started out peddling ices from a   wagon, which is depicted in the company logo. On June 30, Mr. Barbati was shot five times outside his home in the Dyker Heights neighborhood, leaving behind a wife, two sons and the restaurant  \u2014   a fixture on the Brooklyn street corner where it has sat since 1939, topped with fluttering Italian and American flags. St. Ephrem\u2019s Church in Dyker Heights was thick with incense, grief and the unanswered question on every mourner\u2019s face: Why was Mr. Barbati killed? He was best known for doling out spumoni, layered Italian ice cream in pistachio, vanilla and chocolate flavors that gave his family\u2019s restaurant its name. \u201cHe was the best boss,\u201d Efraim Meza, 46, a pizza maker who said he had worked for Mr. Barbati for the past 25 years, recalled outside the church. The restaurant was closed on Tuesday for the funeral, which Mr. Meza had attended with a group of six Spumoni staff members. On the restaurant floor, he said, workers were known by the nicknames bestowed by Mr. Barbati, whom Mr. Meza remembered for his playfulness. Mr. Meza\u2019s nickname was Fraggle. Mr. Meza said the restaurant was \u201clike an empty space\u201d without the presence of Mr. Barbati  \u2014   whose catch phrase, \u201cAtta boy,\u201d would fill the cafe. \u201cHe would always take care of you,\u201d Mr. Meza added. The New York Police Department on Tuesday issued a video showing a person of interest in the case, with the hope it will generate tips and information from the public. \u201cWe\u2019re treating it as a botched robbery,\u201d said J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman. \u201cThere\u2019s some other potential motives, but this is the leading theory. \u201d Mr. Barbati was shot as he returned for dinner with his family, carrying a loaf of Italian bread and more than $10, 000  \u2014   which was not taken. Officials have said that Mr. Barbati carried that much cash home only five or so times a year, without saying why. Detectives are investigating whether his killer knew he was traveling with so much money when he left Spumoni Gardens. Mr. Barbati was wearing jewelry at the time, but that was also left behind, officials have said. In the footage, a man wearing sunglasses, a dark sweatshirt and shorts walks on a sidewalk. The police said investigators wanted to question the man. The assailant has been described similarly to the man in the video clip. Police officials believe he had been waiting for Mr. Barbati as he returned from work. The gunman fled by car as Mr. Barbati called for help before collapsing in his yard. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who it is, but we are looking for the public\u2019s help in identifying the shooter,\u201d Mr. Donald said. At Spumoni Gardens, signs in the window memorialized Mr. Barbati, a throwback to an earlier era of Italian Brooklyn, who once had skirmished over the secret recipe for his pizza sauce and who was known as Lu Lu. Arriving at the locked doors, Deanne Smith, a parole supervisor visiting from New Braunfels, Tex. was trying to make sense of the news. She had brought a group of visitors to try the sauce. \u201cIt tastes just like my grandmother\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only place in all of America that does. This is shocking. \u201d Shortly before she arrived, a hearse bearing Mr. Barbati\u2019s body was driven past the restaurant, according to people who had gathered to pay their respects in its courtyard on Tuesday. One onlooker put his hand on his heart.'"}, "time": 1742563126.4123647}
