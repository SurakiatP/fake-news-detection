Jewish guards who helped murder Jews in the camps. So there were even Jews that were helping the Nazis murder Jews! So blacks who are helping the other side are seriously fucked in the head. They\u2019re only helping the enemy who will destroy them. Maybe they think \u2018if I help them we\u2019ll get along okay; somehow I\u2019ll save my race by working with the murderers,\u2019\u201d said Barber at a fundraiser for Ross on the Upper West Side of New York City on September 19, 2016. \\nProject Veritas Action thought it was important to share Barber\u2019s words with African American Republicans in North Carolina. They expressed outrage over the comments that were made at the Ross fundraiser. \\n\u201cI think that Deborah Ross has shown her true colors. If this is not a, if that\u2026what you just showed me is not racism and condescending and basically calling blacks stupid and ignorant and saying that we are voting against our own self-interest if we support any republican. I am appalled. I am in incensed. Deborah Ross should be called to task for something like that,\u201d said Bishop Wooden, a black voter in North Carolina. \\nProject Veritas Action Fund (AKA Project Veritas Action) was founded by James O\u2019Keefe to investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct.
