[The Alliance for Global Justice, which is funded by the George   Tides Foundation, reportedly donated $50, 000 to fund Refuse Fascism, which openly brags about using violence to shut down conservative and libertarian speech.  \u201cWhile it is unclear whether those who carried out the violence were paid to do so, the benefactors of the Alliance for Global Justice  \u2014   and Refuse Fascism  \u2014   are listed online,\u201d reported the Daily Caller. \u201cAccording to its most recent 990 tax form, Alliance for Global Justice (AfGJ) received $2. 2 million in funding for the fiscal year ending in March 2016. One of the group\u2019s biggest donors is the Tides Foundation, a   funded by billionaire progressive philanthropist George Soros. Tides gave AfGJ $50, 000. \u201d \u201cOther notable donors include the city of Tucson and the United Steel Workers labor union. The former gave $10, 000 to AfGJ while the latter contributed $5, 000,\u201d they continued. \u201cCharities associated with several major corporations also donated. Patagonia. org, the outdoor apparel and equipment company, gave $40, 000. The Ben  Jerry Foundation, the charity associated with the ice cream maker, gave $20, 000. And Lush Cosmetic gave $43, 950. Another bit of irony is seen in the $5, 000 contribution from the Peace Development Fund, a group that claims to support organizations that fight for human rights and social justice. \u201d The group defended the violent riot at Berkeley on Facebook, which left numerous Trump supporters and fans of MILO injured and bloody, before deleting their post. \u201cDismantling police fences is not violent,\u201d they claimed, according to the Daily Caller, ignoring the rest of the violence that occured. \u201cAnd to compare preventing someone like that from speaking to the   violence that they perpetuate everyday is ludicrous. \u201d Refuse Fascism also branded the riot as \u201crighteous,\u201d and encouraged more violence to shut down conservatives in a post on their website. \u201cLast night, thousands of students, professors and others protested the appearance and organizing rally of Milo Yiannopoulos, a major fascist operative, shutting it down. This was righteous and much more like this is needed,\u201d the group proclaimed. \u201cLets be clear: Milo Yiannopoulos is not engaging in \u2018free speech.\u2019 He is consciously spearheading the Nazification of the American University. \u201d The riot started at UC Berkeley on Wednesday after protesters against Breitbart Senior Editor MILO became increasingly violent outside of his show. \u201c \u201d started several fires, smashed windows and ATMs, looted downtown stores, attacked cars, and assaulted dozens of MILO fans, male and female, who they falsely accused of being \u201cNazis. \u201d Despite the large amount of violence, numerous reports indicate that police officers refused to intervene, and only one suspect was arrested. UFC veteran and professional MMA fighter Jake Shields was even forced to rescue a man who was being assaulted by   rioters after police allegedly refused to intervene. \u201cLike fifteen people were trying to attack him and others were cheering them on,\u201d explained Shields, who managed to successfully rescue the man, in an interview with Breitbart News. \u201cNo one helped, no one had the balls to step in, so my reaction was to run in and start picking people off. \u201d \u201cMore chaos started happening, so I went up to the police and tried bringing them back, but they were just like \u2018we\u2019re not really going over there. You should just stay away. \u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they were taking orders from someone or if they were just being lazy. I don\u2019t know what the situation was, but it was pathetic to watch. Our police, who are supposed to defend the citizens of Berkeley. It\u2019s a sad scene that they would allow that. \u201d The national   for the Alliance for Global Justice, Chuck Kaufman, claimed he wasn\u2019t aware that Refuse Fascism were involved in the riots, but defended their involvement citing the fact that numerous   groups joined in. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that Refuse Fascism was involved, but probably they were one of a whole lot of groups calling to shut down Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019 hate speech,\u201d said Kaufman to The Daily Caller. \u201cAfGJ acts as fiscal sponsor for Refuse Fascism which means we process   donations for them. As long as their use of the money falls into areas permitted for   501( c)(3) organizations, we don\u2019t involve ourselves one way or the other in their program work. \u201d Several celebrities and news outlets expressed support for the riot, including Hollywood director Judd Apatow, who deleted his tweet shortly after, and Fusion, who smeared MILO as a \u201cNazi,\u201d before praising rioters. The day after, MILO\u2019s tour bus was tracked down by \u201c \u201d and vandalized, forcing both him and his team to evacuate the premises after his location was leaked online. Four   were also arrested last week after they became violent during a protest against libertarian commentator and VICE   Gavin McInnes, who was speaking at New York University. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself!  Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
