Afraid they\u2019ll wind up on Anderson Cooper. \u201d \u201cMaybe [the police] are not going to have to be so politically correct. Maybe they\u2019re being overly politically correct. \u201d The first quotation is from Frank Rourke (Bill Paxton) the morally suspect but brutally effective Los Angeles police detective at the center of CBS\u2019s \u201cTraining Day. \u201d The second is from the new president of the United States. If you have a hard time telling them apart, who can blame you? The candidate Donald J. Trump, running on \u201claw and order\u201d rhetoric borrowed from Richard M. Nixon, talked crime as if he were recapping a \u201970s cop drama. He repeatedly  \u2014   and falsely  \u2014   claimed that United States murder rates were the highest in 45 years. Cities, to him, were lawless hellscapes: \u201cYou walk down the street, you get shot. \u201d That\u2019s essentially the outlook of two new police shows  \u2014   \u201cTraining Day\u201d and Fox\u2019s \u201cA. P. B. \u201d  \u2014   each of which depicts American cities as   zones that need a tough,   boor to break rules, crack skulls and restore order. In the 2001 film \u201cTraining Day,\u201d Denzel Washington played a corrupt narcotics detective with a knack for busting drug gangs and a weakness for skimming the take. CBS\u2019s \u201cTraining Day,\u201d beginning on Thursday and set in the present, has a tenuous connection to the original. Antoine Fuqua, the film\u2019s director, is among the producers (who also include Jerry Bruckheimer, of \u201cC. S. I. \u201d). But it perverts the dynamic of the film by making its central cop into a charming, roguish maverick. Here, Frank is partnered with Kyle Craig (Justin Cornwell) an idealistic \u201ctrainee\u201d who is actually working undercover to investigate whether Frank has been crossing ethical lines. He has, and he\u2019s damn proud of it. On their first outing, Frank lays out his philosophy: \u201cPolice work\u2019s like sex, Kyle. It\u2019s a lot more effective if it isn\u2019t pretty. \u201d (I would not recommend this as a pickup line.) They cruise the squalid streets as Frank cites some statistics of Trumpian dubiousness: Crime is \u201cup 300 percent,\u201d which does not seem to square with recent Los Angeles police data. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018The Purge\u2019 every night,\u201d he says. Ugly times call for ugly tactics, he feels. If a few lies get told, a few suspects get tortured, a few confiscated dollars go missing  \u2014   hey, freedom ain\u2019t free. \u201cTraining Day\u201d starts off building tension between idealism and security, but it ends up in the tank for Frank. Mr. Cornwell plays Kyle as an upstanding stiff, and the authorities investigating Frank are vindictive bureaucrats. Mr. Paxton gets to deliver the best lines and blow the most stuff up. Wry and swaggering, he\u2019s the only one having any fun here, which pushes the audience to Frank\u2019s side. In this formulaic \u201ccop who won\u2019t play by the book\u201d setup, the book doesn\u2019t stand a chance. Kyle decides to work with Frank rather than turn him in, and \u201cTraining Day\u201d loses its nerve in the process, turning Frank into a raffish renegade who just says what everybody\u2019s thinking. (His name is \u201cFrank,\u201d after all.) This \u201cTraining Day\u201d is a   version of the movie, which paired Mr. Washington with Ethan Hawke as the   rookie. The racial dynamic is glaring as nostalgic white guy Frank fights to Make L. A. Great Again against largely minority criminals. An episode that pits him against Japanese mobsters is almost parodic. \u201cHow is a yakuza like a cue ball?\u201d he says, while beating information out of one. \u201cThe harder you hit \u2019em, the better their English gets!\u201d He ends up using an aluminum baseball bat to duel with a    mob boss, a Yankee Doodle metaphor that\u2019s as subtle as an aluminum baseball bat. If \u201cTraining Day\u201d comes from the \u201cDirty Harry\u201d school of pop authoritarianism, Fox\u2019s \u201cA. P. B. ,\u201d beginning on Monday, is a Silicon Valley \u201cBatman. \u201d Its origin story: on a business trip to Chicago, the billionaire engineer Gideon Reeves (Justin Kirk) watches his best friend die in an armed robbery. Outraged by the sluggish 911 response, he bullies the city government into giving him control of an overwhelmed police precinct. He promptly equips officers with drones,   tasers and a smartphone app for instantaneous police response. RoboCop, meet UberCop. Chicago has become a flash point, to the right for its murder rate (Mr. Trump recently threatened to \u201csend in the Feds! \u201d) and to the left for police brutality. But in \u201cA. P. B. ,\u201d all the city needs is  \u2014   sound familiar?  \u2014   a cocky, rude,    billionaire to disrupt the establishment. \u201cA. P. B. ,\u201d inspired by a New York Times Magazine article about a   police force in New Orleans, stumbled into its relevance. At heart, it doesn\u2019t aim to be more than a disposable,    action show. Mr. Kirk is disarmingly snide as the arrogant Gideon. There\u2019s a little melodrama and a lot of   and the crime stories are as mechanical as Gideon\u2019s gadgets. The closest the show gets to big ideas about policing come when the     detective Theresa Murphy (Natalie Martinez) reminds her new boss that computers can\u2019t replace the human element. Like \u201cTraining Day,\u201d \u201cA. P. B. \u201d was in the works well before Election Day (though not before Black Lives Matter and the reaction to it). The shows\u2019 content is mainly driven by the eternal needs of broadcast drama: heroes (or, increasingly, antiheroes) villains and   stakes. You can\u2019t make much of a crime procedural out of people not committing crimes. Occasionally, a serial like HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Wire\u201d or FX\u2019s \u201cThe Shield\u201d will question the tactics and premises of an objective like the war on drugs. In March, Fox will air \u201cShots Fired,\u201d a provocative series about the complicated aftermath of a racially charged shooting in North Carolina. Most network police series don\u2019t have that kind of ambition. But intentionally or not, \u201cTraining Day\u201d and \u201cA. P. B. \u201d have a message, anyway: that it\u2019s a sick, sad world, and if you want to live, you\u2019d best give a free hand to the kind of abrasive jerks you see on TV. They alone can fix it.'"}, "time": 1742628573.7562127}
