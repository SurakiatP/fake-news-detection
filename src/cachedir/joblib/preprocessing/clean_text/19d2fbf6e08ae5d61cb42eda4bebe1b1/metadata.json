DeVos has been one of the most controversial picks for President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet. Objections to her nomination have come from both the left, including teachers\u2019 unions, and the grassroots base of the GOP who want to see the federal education department dismantled and oversight of education turned back to parents and local school districts.
