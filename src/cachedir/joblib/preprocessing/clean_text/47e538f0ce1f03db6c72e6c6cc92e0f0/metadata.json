Officials immediately ruled it an accident and began the narrative that the gun somehow just went off on its own. \\n\u201cWe do not know yet the mechanics of how the weapon discharged,\u201d Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said. \u201cSo far, we have absolutely no reason to believe this was anything more than a tragic accidental shooting.\u201d \\nDeputy Sgt. Rod Lucas was having a conversation near the Fresno Yosemite International Airport about how to carry backup weapons when one deputy\u2019s weapon was discharged striking Lucas in the chest. \\nLucas was in the room with two other deputies, and, according to Mims, there was no dispute at the time \u2014 ironically, just a conversation about weapons safety. \\n\u201cThe detective had his weapon out. During this discussion, the detective\u2019s weapon discharged,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cSgt. Lucas was struck by the bullet in his chest, and he dropped to the ground.\u201d \\nAccording to FOX, Mims did not disclose the type of firearm involved in the incident, calling it \u201can improved secondary weapon for the detective.\u201d She said all witnesses have been interviewed except for the detective, who was not identified, due to his mental state which she described as extremely upset. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving him the time he needs,\u201d said Mims, who declined to identify the detective by name. \u201cWe\u2019re taking care of him.\u201d \\nImagine for a moment, that a non-cop \u2018accidentally\u2019 shot and killed another man. Would they be allowed this same opportunity to not be investigated? Would a person who just killed someone in a room be \u2018taken care of\u2019 if they simply used the excuse of the gun accidentally going off? \\nSadly enough, this is the third such incident in only a week in which a cop\u2019s firearm \u2018accidentally discharged\u2019 and put the lives of others in danger. \\nAt a Halloween party over the weekend, a cop in North Carolina shot and severely injured her own daughter as she showed off her service weapon. She has not been charged. \\nPrior to that shooting, a cop in Ohio fired his weapon into a daycare center \u2014 while it was fully occupied. \\nDespite the officer clearly admitting to committing the misdemeanor offense of discharging a firearm within city limits, police have yet to charge him. \\nImagine if the people in these incidents were not police officers. The double standard is glaring. \\nAside from the above the law treatment of these officers, the excuse of the weapons accidentally discharging is nothing short of asinine. \\nGuns do not fire themselves. \\nWeapons companies spend a significant amount of time and money making sure their guns don\u2019t simply \u2018go off.\u2019 While it is entirely possible for older single action revolvers, which required the hammer to be cocked, to go off when dropped, the idea of a modern pistol accidentally firing without someone pulling the trigger is simply absurd. \\nThere are more guns than people in the United States. It is estimated that Americans own around 357 million firearms. If these weapons were so prone to accidentally firing, there would be a lot of dead Americans. However, that is clearly not the case. \\nThe reality is that these cases involve police, who are entrusted by the public to responsibly carry weapons, failing miserably at their jobs. You could rest assured that if a mere citizen were to shoot and kill another person while \u2018discussing backup weapons,\u2019 they would be cast out by the anti-gun crowd and plastered across the mainstream media. They would also be in jail. \\nHowever, if your job is to carry a firearm for a living to ostensibly protect society and you kill your own colleague while doing this job \u2014 you are immediately presumed innocent and given special treatment.

So my guess is detective kojack was showing off his new play pretty and the hair trigger spring he just installed and shot this cop. Well done safety meeting I say. One less gangster in Fresno.
