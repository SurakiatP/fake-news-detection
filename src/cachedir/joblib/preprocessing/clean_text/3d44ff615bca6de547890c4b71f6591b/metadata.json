N. ambassador John Bolton discussed the Trump administration\u2019s top foreign policy objectives with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily. [Curt Schilling, who was   from CPAC on Thursday morning, asked Bolton what he thought the top foreign policy concern for the Trump administration was at the moment.  \u201cI think there are two immediate concerns, and then there are two strategic concerns that may sound   but require corrective action by the Trump administration just as soon as they can get to it, to overcome the mistakes of the last eight years,\u201d Bolton replied. \u201cThe two immediate threats are the proliferation of nuclear, chemical weapons. We see Iran and North Korea as the sort of two   threats in that regard. And then, second, the continuing threat of radical Islamic terrorism, with ISIS,   the Taliban in Afghanistan, all really threatening us in palpable ways today. \u201d \u201cThe two   threats  \u2014   although again, we see them in the news  \u2014   are China and Russia,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe need to have a   strategy to keep Russia in check in both Eastern and Central Europe and in the Middle East. \u201d \u201cThe relationship with China, I think, will be the dominant international issue for the United States for the rest of this century, and we\u2019re not doing well right now,\u201d he warned. \u201cThey\u2019re creating their own new province in the South China Sea. They\u2019re taking a huge chunk of territory and sea lanes out of international status and making them Chinese national territory, and Obama just watched it happen. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot on the administration\u2019s plate, an awful lot to do. We obviously focus in the media on terrorism, and Americans are rightly concerned about it, but this is not just a Middle East issue, and it\u2019s not just the threat of terrorism that, I think, the president in his   perspective has to deal with,\u201d he said. Turning to quick hits on a few other topics, Bolton praised the current U. N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, for doing \u201can excellent job,\u201d in particular applauding her assault on the U. N. security council\u2019s   bias last week. \u201cI\u2019m glad she said what she did. It was right on target. I hope she continues,\u201d he said. Marlow mentioned the news about Senator John McCain making a \u201csecret trip to Syria\u201d and wondered if he was trying to establish a \u201cshadow presidency. \u201d \u201cWell, look, McCain has been involved in the conflict in Syria for a long time, and we\u2019re at a very important moment here because if Iran is able to keep the Assad regime in power and we continue to follow the Obama policy of opposing ISIS in a way that magnifies the positive effects for Iran, for its surrogate regime in Iraq, for Assad, for Hezbollah, we may eliminate ISIS  \u2014   which I think Trump is determined to do, unlike Obama. But we don\u2019t want to do it in a way that maximizes the benefit for Iran. So I think this is something that, really, it\u2019s an     kind of problem. How are we going to go after ISIS more effectively than Obama did without advantaging Iran?\u201d Bolton asked. Bolton looked at President Trump\u2019s immigration reforms and Mexico\u2019s hostile reaction to them, observing that \u201cthe rules, to me, look like saying we\u2019re actually going to enforce American law that\u2019s already on the books. \u201d \u201cHow\u2019s that for a revolution?\u201d he asked sardonically. \u201cWhere you put the people you\u2019re deporting  \u2014   I mean, ultimately, they\u2019ve got to go back to their country of origin. Mexico\u2019s objecting that a lot of them aren\u2019t Mexican. On the other hand, they got into the United States through Mexico. Maybe it should be Mexico\u2019s problem,\u201d Bolton mused. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how discussions went last night. We don\u2019t have reporting on it. They see the Mexican president today, and we\u2019ll know from there. \u201d John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and presides over his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.
