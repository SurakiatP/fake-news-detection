According to O\u2019Reilly, the supposed crisis is \u201cfake\u201d and is being \u201cmanufactured\u201d by mainstream media to hurt President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to govern. Partial transcript as follows: So in the midst of this big story, terror story, in England and the president speaking to the Pope and then going to NATO in Belgium, what do I see on CNN? White House in crisis. This is what they\u2019re doing. This is what their lead was last night. I mean, I\u2019m saying to myself, am I not living in the real world anymore? White House in crisis. What crisis? What crisis? There is an investigation going on on whether Russians were able to compromise people like General Michael Flynn, and Paul Manafort, who worked for Trump briefly in his campaign. Were they able, the Russians, to compromise those people in some way? That\u2019s the investigation. OK, that\u2019s where we are right now. That\u2019s a White House in crisis? See this is all fake. It is fake. The crisis is being manufactured. Now that being said, it could down the road lead to something more. It\u2019s possible. I want to know. Mueller is investigating now, the FBI is investigating, and two congressional committees are investigating. That\u2019s four. So I assume we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it. But in the meantime, the   media is going to gin it up every single crisis, crisis, crisis. And what does that do? It hurts the president\u2019s ability to govern because he\u2019s always on the defensive. (  RCP Video) Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742562190.529457}
