U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued a blistering caution to Scott\u2019s top election official on a lawsuit about vote-by-mail ballots. \\nAccording to ABC News , the judge accused Governor Scott appointed Secretary of State Ken Detzner of \u201cdelaying a hearing on the lawsuit, so that he could use every second available to run out the clock,\u201d . That means, there would not be enough time to address the lawsuit.
