Skorton))), has decided to exclude Supreme Court Justice Judge Clarence Thomas from its African-American Museum, showing that Jews only want to empower certain kinds of blacks that advance Jew-specific agendas. This Jew gets to decide who gets into the black museum and who doesn\u2019t. \\nWhile I don\u2019t agree with Thomas\u2019 conservative philosophy, he has long been a constitution-respecting thorn in the side of the Jewish activist judge bloc of Ginsburg, Breyer and Kagan. Whenever these Jews (and Sotomayor, along with the Jew Merrick Garland if he gets confirmed) vote to get something insane through, Thomas has been a reliable voice of reason tempering and often downvoting them in defense of free speech, freedom of association, etc. \\nComing from a background of poverty and homelessness, Thomas has genuinely worked hard and shown remarkable aptitude in the art of jurisprudence, he wasn\u2019t appointed to fill an Affirmative Action quota. He is a member of the \u201ctalented tenth\u201d of the black race and if there\u2019s going to be an African-American museum, he has certainly earned his place in it, yet won\u2019t be included , because he has refused to abuse his gavel in pursuit of violent anti-White discord. Rather than commending him for his legal ethic, Jews are punishing him by obliterating his memory as soon as he dies to serve as an example to any other unusually intelligent blacks out there. \\nIt\u2019s not a secret that Jews filter just who and what Negroes in America should aspire to, from founding the pro-race mixing NAACP and sabotaging black nationalist Marcus Garvey, to running virtually all media intended for black people (BET-owned by Sumner Redstone\u2019s Viacom, or The Root \u00c2 \u2013\u00c2 run by Israeli citizen Haim Saban\u2019s Univision), and now picking and choosing what individuals blacks should exemplary members of their race. \\nSo who is being included? \\nWell, the African-American Museum has an entire section dedicated to the Jewish-financed and extreme anti-white Black Panthers , Black Lives Matter, convicted Cultural Marxist terrorist Angela Davis. Examples of some of the ideological indoctrination featured at this Jewseum. Is (((Gloria Steinem))) \u201cAfrican-American\u201d? So why is she there? \\nCracked out James Brown, famous for shuckin\u2019 and jivin\u2019 while smoking crack and not much else, is according to reports treated by the Smithsonian as the second coming of Christ. \\nIs that appropriate? \\nI won\u2019t go as far as to claim that blacks would be astrophysicists if all Jews vanished tomorrow, but I will say that blacks would not only be far better off according to every metric, they also would instinctively respect and emulate the White man as Booker T. Washington believed they should, rather than lash out at us for no reason as Jews instruct them to. \\nBlacks in the 1930\u2019s once had a crime rate lower than urban Italian and Irish in the law and order South, along with their own small businesses, farms, fairly in-tact families. But because the Jew capitalizes on dysfunctional societies full of dysfunctional people, James Brown is made immortal while they pretend Clarence Thomas ain\u2019t a REAL nigga . \\nJewish cultural mandate socializes some Whites into acting like low-lives as well. While the manifestations are different depending on natural temperament and abilities of race, one thing we can all agree on is that neither the White man nor the black man are living up to their full potential in this age of decline and decay.'"}, "time": 1742628328.1727974}
