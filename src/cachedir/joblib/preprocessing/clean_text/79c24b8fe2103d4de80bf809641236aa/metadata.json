For nearly two weeks, the Syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry, caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find. \u201cWhen the world gets hard for us, we work something out,\u201d said a woman in a video posted on Facebook showing how she used a   cola bottle to wash teacups. \u201cWhen you cut off the water, we dig for water. When you cut off the tap, we make a tap. \u201d Like most of Syria\u2019s problems, the Damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced about half the country\u2019s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government, armed rebels and jihadist groups. While a   brokered by Russia and Turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country, it has not stopped the fighting everywhere, nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies, as appears to be the case with Damascus\u2019s water. Historically, most of the water for the capital, which is controlled by the government of President Bashar   has come from the Barada Valley north of the city, which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad. The crisis began on Dec. 22, when the water stopped flowing. Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring, halting the flow. Antigovernment activists have posted photos online, purporting to show structures around the spring that they say were damaged by exploding barrels dropped from government helicopters. The government first accused the rebels of polluting the water, then of damaging the infrastructure. Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian office in Geneva, said by email Tuesday that the \u201cdeliberate targeting of the water infrastructure\u201d had caused the  . \u201cBut we are not in a position to say by whom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe area has been the scene of much fighting, so we have not been able to access it. \u201d Now, 5. 5 million people in Damascus and the vicinity lack water, which has raised the risk of waterborne disease, especially among children, he said. Fighting near the Barada Valley has continued despite the  . Antigovernment activists say that government forces, and fighters from Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah organization, have continued to attack the area in an apparent attempt to take it over. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts in Syria, said the government launched 15 airstrikes on the area Monday amid clashes between rebels and   forces. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, accused the Syrian government and its allies on Wednesday of violating the   saying that the new violence could derail peace talks meant to be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, on Jan. 23. Rebel groups have threatened to boycott the talks if government attacks do not stop. Few Damascus residents expect much from the talks or have time to think about them. While generally safe from the violence that had reduced other parts of the country to rubble, they were struggling through a cold winter of high prices and scarce commodities before the water crisis, making things worse. The Syrian government has sought to ease the crisis by trucking water from wells around the city, and the United Nations has rehabilitated 120 wells to cover about   of the city\u2019s daily needs, Mr. Laerke, the spokesman, said. But many residents said they had received nothing. Some were buying water from men with private tankers, while others took advantage of whatever they could get. A    shopkeeper said he had not had a shower in 10 days but that he and his sons went to the mosque every day to wash their hands, feet and faces, an option not available to the women of the house. At home, he said, they used plastic utensils because they could not wash dishes. One    woman said she had not had running water in her home for 10 days. Her two sons have spent hours each day lining up to fill jugs from the well at their mosque. They use that to drink and to wash dishes, collecting the runoff to flush the toilet. \u201cMy family\u2019s dream is to get a warm shower,\u201d she said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for communicating with a foreign news outlet without government permission. \u201cIt has become our ultimate hope in Damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine. \u201d She expressed anger that Syria\u2019s   news media had said little about the water crisis, instead focusing on the military\u2019s battles with rebels. \u201cWe are fed up with the news of military operations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want news about water and water supply schedules. \u201d Despite the water crisis, conditions in Damascus are far better than those in Aleppo, the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country, where Syrian and Russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side. While the   appears to be holding there, the formerly   eastern quarters are abandoned wastelands, United Nations relief officials said. \u201cNothing prepared us for what we saw,\u201d Sajjad Malik, the United Nations acting humanitarian coordinator for Syria, told reporters Wednesday in a telephone briefing from Aleppo. \u201cThe infrastructure was destroyed in almost every neighborhood. \u201d Mr. Malik said more than 100 United Nations relief workers from several agencies were helping civil defense teams remove debris and provide emergency food, water, shelter and medical care in the city, where four million people once lived. He estimated that 1. 5 million people remain in Aleppo, mostly on the western side, including roughly 400, 000 Syrians displaced from other areas. He also said thousands of displaced residents from the eastern side were starting to return, even if their homes and businesses were badly damaged or destroyed. \u201cThey\u2019re beginning to talk about rebuilding their lives and livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Malik said. But he cautioned that \u201cAleppo\u2019s reconstruction is going to take a much longer time and way more resources than we have right now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562077.4293747}
