I don\u2019t respect this president. I don\u2019t think that he deserves to be president of this great country. I am very concerned about him. And I really think he\u2019s dangerous. And, Joe, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the   series that the \u201cL. A. Times\u201d wrote about him. It is scathing.

I have taken him on as you know, and the millennials have joined me. And so I continue to talk about his ties to Russia and what I think all of that means.
