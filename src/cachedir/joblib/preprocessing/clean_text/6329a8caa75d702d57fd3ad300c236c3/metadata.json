[Ryan answered questions at the Policy Exchange think tank in London Wednesday. When asked about plans to move forward with a Republican Health care plan, the Speaker was unequivocal. \u201cHealth care is not dead, we\u2019re still working on it,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have to step in front of this crisis,\u201d Ryan said about the future of president Barack Obama\u2019s signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Healthcare Act, commonly called \u201cObamacare. \u201d Ryan characterized the current system as \u201ccollapsing under its own weight\u201d and pointed to numerous states and counties in which only a single insurance company is still offering coverage. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a system in dire need of reform,\u201d he cautioned. The plan Ryan himself wholeheartedly pushed to replace Obamacare, the \u201cAmerican Health Care Act (AHCA),\u201d had to be withdrawn before it reached a vote due to insufficient support on the House floor and even less favorable public polling. In the intervening weeks, however, there have been indications the different factions within the House Republican majority, including the Freedom Caucus so instrumental in defeating the AHCA, have been readying a second attempt at repeal and replace. Speaker Ryan seemed to  confirm that such a regrouping is in the works. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of negotiating sorta finishing touches,\u201d he said of an    unannounced plan. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to do. We\u2019re very close. It\u2019s basically \u2018make good on the promises that were made. \u2019\u201d While details were skant, Ryan offered up what he considered the goals of the next Republican effort to make good on one of the party\u2019s   standing campaign issues. \u201cWe want to have a system in America where everyone has affordable access to good health insurance   \u2026     including people with   conditions. That is not what the current law does and it\u2019s just gonna take us a little time to make good on that,\u201d Ryan said. Ryan also explained his reasoning for keeping the order of his legislative priorities unchanged: finishing health care first before moving on to tax reform. \u201cIt makes it much easier for us to do tax reform if we first do health care reform,\u201d Ryan said. According to him, repealing Obamacare will necessarily repeal nearly $1 trillion in taxes. \u201cThe way that works in our numbers is ten points of corporate tax rate reduction. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563164.5307653}
