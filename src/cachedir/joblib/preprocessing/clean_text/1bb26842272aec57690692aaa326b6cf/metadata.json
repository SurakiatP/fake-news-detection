Saturday on \u201cFox  Friends,\u201d former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski accused former FBI Director Jim Comey of being a \u201cliar\u201d who is looking to turn his spotlight into a major book deal.  \u201cI think Jim Comey\u2019s in big trouble because under oath in front of the committee he said things which we know to be factually inaccurate, not just in his testimony this week, but when he was the director of the FBI he\u2019s had to come back and recant statements that he\u2019s made   \u2026     because Jim Comey\u2019s a liar,\u201d Lewandowski said. Lewandowski went on to address a rumor that Comey is about to sign a lucrative book deal, saying it is just another example of the Washington D. C. \u201cswamp creatures\u201d being \u201cvery real. \u201d \u201c[W]hat we saw this week, I\u2019m shocked by this news, is Jim Comey\u2019s about to sign a $10 million book deal, right?\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these guys go from government service to   and people wonder why Washington is broken. This is what happens all the time. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742561667.7967114}
