[On the heels of FOX\u2019s suggestion that the NFL limit its number of broadcast windows, CBS President Les Moonves has told the commissioner that the games need to start moving a lot faster. According to Fortune, \u201cIf there are ways of doing advertising in different ways that are equally beneficial, we\u2019re looking at that, and we\u2019re trying to make the game as good an experience as we could make it. \u201d  According to Pro Football Talk, \u201cMoonves also discussed with Goodell ways that the referees could see the replays more quickly so that replay reviews would be shorter. \u201d This is one of those things that sounds great in theory, but could end up a nightmare in practice. Pay close attention to what Moonves has suggested here. He\u2019s not saying that the league should run fewer commercials. That\u2019s not a real option for a league that exists to make money, which the NFL definitely does. No, instead Moonves suggests \u201cadvertising in different ways that are equally beneficial. \u201d That could very well mean  on uniforms. It could mean  along the sidelines, similar to what hockey and soccer does. It could mean any number of really intrusive advertising methods that NFL fans have not had to put up with before. While everyone would like fewer advertising interruptions, not everyone wants to see Tom Brady with a \u201cPapa John\u2019s\u201d logo on his chest. The suggestion to speed up replay reviews has merit. Officials have consistently taken longer than their allotted time on reviews for quite a while. But why not just focus on simplifying the rule book, and encouraging referees to use discretion when making calls, so that only the most obvious calls get made instead of calling everything the officials see? If the game moved faster with fewer unplanned interruptions such as penalties, then the planned interruptions, in this case the commercials, wouldn\u2019t seem all that bad. Whatever they decide, the NFL formula of about 20 minutes of real football action spread across a      time period is clearly not working.
