Trump will visit Mexico on Wednesday for a private meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto  \u2014   a trip that will take him to a nation he has repeatedly scorned  \u2014   before quickly flying back for what is billed as a major immigration speech in Arizona. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s office said Tuesday night that the meeting would take place at the presidential palace in Mexico City, and Mr. Trump, on Twitter, said he looked \u201cvery much forward\u201d to the visit. The Mexican president\u2019s office said Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto had sent invitations last week to both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton. The negotiations for both trips were first reported by The Washington Post. The Clinton campaign said Mrs. Clinton last met with the Mexican president in 2014 and would talk again with him \u201cat the appropriate time,\u201d without elaborating. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto is reaching out to Mr. Trump in the face of the Republican candidate\u2019s antagonistic attitude toward Mexico in his policies and campaign rallies. He has said many Mexican immigrants who enter the United States illegally are rapists, and he has repeatedly insisted that Mexico will pay for his proposed wall along the southern United States border. He is widely reviled in Mexico, where the wall proposal has revived deep grievances over sovereignty and respect that have historically dogged Mexico\u2019s relationship with the United States. \u201cThey are not our friend, believe me,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a speech last year in which he accused Mexico of treating the United States unfairly, \u201cbut they are killing us economically. \u201d \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists, and some I assume are good people. \u201d Politicians in Mexico have largely remained silent on Mr. Trump, though there have been outbursts, including from Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto himself. In March, he compared Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini for what he called Mr. Trump\u2019s strident remarks and populism, though he later tried to soften his words without quite taking them back. The trip will take place hours before Mr. Trump is to give a speech in Phoenix that is expected to clarify his stance on immigration, which has plagued his campaign over the past few weeks as he has wavered on key elements of his platform. His campaign has given conflicting signals over whether he will stick to the   positions he took during the Republican primaries, particularly on deportations, and he suggested recently that he was open to \u201csoftening\u201d some of his proposals. But his calls to have Mexico pay for the wall have continued. \u201cFrom the first days of his campaign, Donald Trump has painted Mexicans as \u2018rapists\u2019 and criminals and has promised to deport 16 million people, including children and U. S. citizens,\u201d Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign\u2019s communications director, said in a statement. \u201cWhat ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions. \u201d The trip is the latest gamble for Mr. Trump and his struggling campaign. But for all the risk it poses, it offers an image Mr. Trump relishes: of a wily negotiator willing to do the unexpected  \u2014   meeting with a perceived enemy  \u2014   to advance his agenda. It will also be his first official meeting with a head of state as the Republican presidential nominee. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s routine scolding of Mexico and its leadership, several of his closest allies have warm ties with the country and its president. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a top Trump adviser and confidant, traveled to Mexico in 2014 to meet with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, arguing that it was imperative for the United States to put Mexico at the center of its foreign relations. During that trip, Mr. Christie offered lavish praise for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s   policies and, unlike Mr. Trump, spoke of the need to cultivate stronger ties with Mexico. \u201cToo often, our neighbors in Mexico and Canada have felt that they were an afterthought in U. S. foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cMy view is that they should be our first thought. \u201d A person briefed on the trip discussions said that Mr. Christie, who leads Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, had helped with them. Mexico\u2019s disaffection with Mr. Trump began early in his campaign, when he said, among other things, that the immigrants entering the United States illegally from Mexico were criminals. From that point on, columns, articles and public forums have been filled with   tirades, his words galvanizing Mexicans across the social spectrum. Artisans have fashioned Trump pi\u00f1atas, and former President Vicente Fox has made it his mission to rebuke Mr. Trump\u2019s every word, to name but two of the rejoinders from Mexican society. Last year, writers, intellectuals and scientists from across the   world wrote a public letter denouncing Mr. Trump and accusing him of xenophobia. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s finance minister has said that under no circumstances would Mexico pay for a border wall. Andrew Selee, the executive vice president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a Mexico expert, said Mexico\u2019s motivation to invite Mr. Trump might simply have been pragmatic. \u201cI think the Mexican government wants channels with whoever is going to be president of the U. S. next, and Trump is a legitimate candidate,\u201d Mr. Selee said. \u201cAnd from a political perspective, Pe\u00f1a Nieto getting Trump to come to Mexico shows that Trump has been forced to shift some of his rhetoric and take Mexico seriously. \u201d But considering how often Mr. Trump comes up in conversation in Mexico, and the uniform insult felt by the nation every time he talks about the wall, the government has remained disciplined in their public statements. That is in part a political decision: Officials feel that any responses will do little but provide more publicity for the candidate. For Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, though, the politics could be difficult. His poll numbers are the lowest of any Mexican president in a  .'"}, "time": 1742561777.779828}
