Iraqi lives are a cheap commodity, so it will not be a problem to find another expendable tank crew. \\nBack in 2012 former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno testified to Congress that the Army has more than enough tanks. He suggested the line at General Dynamics be shut down temporarily. \u201cOur tank fleet is two and a half years old on average now. We\u2019re in good shape and these are additional tanks that we don\u2019t need,\u201d he said. \\nCongress budgeted more money for new tanks anyway. Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said more tanks were needed in Europe to confront Vladimir Putin. \\nMilitary readiness is a \u201cconsumable,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Thomas A. Horlander, the Army\u2019s budget director. Military hardware is \u201ccumulative,\u201d according to the Pentagon. \\nOn Tuesday General Dynamics stock opened at $151.21 and closed at $152.59. Last week the corporation was awarded a $170 million contract for an air-to-ground rocket system. Earlier this month General Dynamics was awarded a $900 million contract over five years to provide engineering and technical services for major weapon systems, program technical assistance, support systems requirements and assist with production decision-making and program controls, according to MarketWatch . \\nThe United States is the largest producer and exporter of weapons in the world. The US armed forces budget topped out over $600 billion in 2015. \\nU.S. Military Budgets 1948-2015 \\nObama FY2010-15 $663.4 billion per year Bush Jr FY2002-09* $634.9'"}, "time": 1742563575.6071146}
