Vice President Joe Biden, and potentially secretary of state should Hillary Clinton be elected (let that sink in for a minute), claimed that Clinton didn\u2019t understand \u201cthe gravity\u201d of using private servers to send and receive classified information as secretary of state. \\nSocial media users pointed out the obviously ridiculous nature of this defense, as many have throughout the whole email debacle. Clinton is either pathetically inept of dangerously corrupt \u2014 I\u2019d argue that there\u2019s a lot of both in the equation. Both options mean that she should be behind bars and not running for president.

I\\'m quite certain she \"understood the gravity\" https://t.co/nZK9EBQp27 \\n\u2014 The H2 (@TheH2) October 28, 2016 \\nTwitter user \u201cThe H2\u201d pointed out that Clinton very likely understood the gravity just fine; it\u2019s probably why she set up the servers in the first place. The H2 tweeted: \u201cUmmm, she did it specifically to evade FOIA. I\u2019m quite certain she \u201cunderstood the gravity.\u201d \\nAbsolutely. Clinton almost certainly set up the servers to \u201cevade FOIA,\u201d and the inevitable failures/corruption (such as the pay-to-play operation) she would need to cover up as secretary of state. \\nThe thousands of emails deleted from Clinton\u2019s servers weren\u2019t just yoga schedules and wedding planning \u2014 the State Department admitted there were Benghazi-related emails in there. \\nClinton is responsible for the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, and it is almost a certainty that emails pointing to her involvement were scrubbed \u2014 in addition to what we already know that points to her responsibility. She understood \"the gravity\" she just thought she could \"get away with it\" #Corruption #draintheswamp #newsisback https://t.co/TrN0xUSbaX \\n\u2014 Jesse Eaton (@landho69) October 28, 2016 \\nJesse Eaton tweeted: \u201cShe understood \u2018the gravity\u2019 she just thought she could \u2018get away with it.\\'\u201d \\nThat about covers it. She knew what she was doing, but since she also knows where all the bodies are buried she gets to play by a different set of rules. \\nWe found out that President Obama, using a pseudonym, communicated with Clinton via her private email server \u2014 not her state.gov address \u2014 even though he claimed not to know about the servers until the scandal came out in the press. Why would he do that if he thought things were on the up and up and didn\u2019t know a thing about the private server? \\nThat might have been part of Clinton\u2019s insurance here as well. She may have figured that if she goes down, so does Obama. That would be pretty stupid considering Clinton found out where she sat on the totem pole in 2008, but no one ever said the woman was a genius. \\nThe FBI announced on Friday that it reopened the investigation of Clinton\u2019s email scandal, and hopefully Clinton will finally be brought to justice. Not likely, but who knows?'"}, "time": 1742628590.1704586}
