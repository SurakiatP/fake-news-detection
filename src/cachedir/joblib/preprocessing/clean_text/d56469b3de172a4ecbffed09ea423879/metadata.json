Malia\u2019s    decision, announced in a news release after months of official silence from the White House about her college search process, will make her the latest in a long line of presidential children to attend the elite university in Cambridge, Mass. Both of her parents attended law school there. \u201cThe President and Mrs. Obama announced today that their daughter Malia will attend Harvard University in the fall of 2017 as a member of the Class of 2021. Malia will take a gap year before beginning school,\u201d the White House said in a statement. In deferring her start date until 2017, Malia, 17, is availing herself of the opportunity to take a \u201cgap year,\u201d a popular option for high school seniors who are seeking experiences outside the classroom  \u2014   some in   parts of the world  \u2014   before they begin pursuing a degree. Harvard actively encourages admitted students to do so. It may also yield a less scrutinized   experience for Malia, whose parents have worked vigilantly to keep her out of the public eye during her years in the White House and hope to shield her from such attention as a college student. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a presidential   the rest of your life you\u2019re famous, you\u2019re a target, you\u2019re in a security bubble, but it\u2019s not the same,\u201d said Gil Troy, a presidential historian at McGill University and the author of \u201cThe Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s. \u201d \u201cThe kids can get to at least some level of irrelevance that they absolutely cannot get when they\u2019re still in the White House. \u201d Malia visited Harvard and a handful of other Ivy League and liberal arts schools last March on the East Coast, setting off speculation about where she might go. But the White House has steadfastly refused to comment on her college deliberations, even last month when she accompanied Mr. Obama on a trip to California, prompting whispers that she was giving Stanford University a final look before committing herself there. Harvard accepted 5. 2 percent of applicants this year, making this admissions cycle the most selective in its nearly   history. When she arrives at Harvard, Malia will join a long list of presidential children who have attended, including John Quincy Adams and his son, John Adams II Abraham Lincoln\u2019s son Robert the sons of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F. Kennedy and George W. Bush, who went to business school there. The university has also long been a popular destination for the children of foreign leaders. Malia, who turns 18 in July, is a senior at the prestigious Sidwell Friends School here. The school sends a handful of students to Harvard most years.'"}, "time": 1742564430.5181367}
