In fact, a renowned security guru thinks someone is learning how to take down the Internet. \\nThat expert predicted several weeks earlier that it would happen. \\n\u201cOver the past year or two, someone has been probing the defenses of the companies that run critical pieces of the Internet,\u201d Bruce Schneier wrote on September 13. \u201cThese probes take the form of precisely calibrated attacks designed to determine exactly how well these companies can defend themselves, and what would be required to take them down.\u201d \\nInternet infrastructure companies noticed a big upswing in attacks in recent months, Schneier wrote. Those attacks, in fact, were similar to the one that knocked out the company Dyn, which provides critical services to Amazon and the other companies that went down. On Oct. 21, hackers launched a massive distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on Dyn, overwhelming the system and causing it to crash. \\n\u201cIf you want to take a network off the Internet, the easiest way to do it is with a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS),\u201d Schneier wrote on his blog and at LawFareBlog.com. \u201c\u2026 Basically it means blasting so much data at the site that it\u2019s overwhelmed. These attacks are not new: hackers do this to sites they don\u2019t like, and criminals have done it as a method of extortion. There is an entire industry, with an arsenal of technologies, devoted to DDoS defense. But largely it\u2019s a matter of bandwidth. If the attacker has a bigger fire hose of data than the defender has, the attacker wins.\u201d Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742562989.0382843}
