Ryan Lundeby, 32, an Army Ranger with five deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, took in the scene from his table, seemingly meditative beneath his shaved head and long beard. He was not. \u201cHe watches, he\u2019s always watching he notices everything,\u201d said his wife, Mary. \u201cSuperman noticing skills, that\u2019s what I call it. Look, he\u2019s doing it now  \u2014   Ryan?\u201d \u201cThat table over there,\u201d Mr. Lundeby said, his voice soft, his eyes holding a line. \u201cThe guy threw his straw wrapper on the ground. I\u2019m waiting to see if he picks it up. \u201d He did not. Mr. Lundeby\u2019s breathing slowed. After 14 years of war, the number of veterans with multiple tours of combat duty is the largest in modern American history  \u2014   more than 90, 000 soldiers and Marines, many of them elite fighters who deployed four or more times. New evidence suggests that these veterans are not like most others when it comes to adjusting to civilian life. An analysis of Army data shows that, unlike most of the military, these soldiers\u2019 risk of committing suicide actually drops when they are deployed and soars after they return home. For the 85 percent of soldiers who make up the rest of the service and were deployed, the reverse is true. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the opposite of what you see in the trauma literature, where more exposure predicts more problems,\u201d said Ronald Kessler of Harvard, who led the study. The findings may shed a clearer light on the need of this important group of veterans, whose experience is largely unparalleled in American history, in their numerous exposures to insurgent warfare, without clear fronts or predictable local populations. Researchers are finding that these elite fighters do not easily fit into the classic mold of veterans traumatized by their experience in war. As psychologists and others grow to understand this, they are starting to rethink some approaches to their treatment. The idea that these elite fighters can adapt solely by addressing emotional trauma, some experts said, is badly misplaced. Their primary difficulty is not necessarily one of healing emotional wounds they thrived in combat. It is rather a matter of unlearning the very skills that have kept them alive: unceasing vigilance snap decision making intolerance for carelessness the urge to act fast and decisively. \u201cI don\u2019t even leave my house much,\u201d said Jeff Ewert, who served with the Marines in Iraq and now lives in Utah. \u201cI\u2019m scared not because I\u2019m an   or anything. I just minimize my exposure because I know how easy it is to cross that line, to act without thinking. \u201d Alan Peterson, an Air Force veteran who oversees two large research consortiums studying combat stress at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, is sharply aware of the challenges. \u201cTurning off this   after returning from a deployment is not an automatic function of the brain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have virtually no science to guide us in managing these instincts. We need to figure that out, or we\u2019re going to end up with a generation that struggles for much of their lives. \u201d Mr. Lundeby\u2019s Ranger battalion specialized in extractions  \u2014   surprise raids on   insurgents. The soldiers usually struck at night  \u2014   vampire work, some called it  \u2014   and often the missions were over within a couple of hours. It is one thing to train for such work. It is another to perform well when something goes sideways. In a 2007 raid in Baghdad, the team blew the front door off a house, leaving a screen door  . The first man inside  \u2014   the point man and team leader  \u2014   tripped on the screen and fell down. Mr. Lundeby was behind him. \u201cYou want to help him, you feel this almost tidal pull,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s someone else\u2019s job yours is to keep the momentum going. \u201d He next remembers being in the house, the green haze of the   gear, going room to room, watching for anything amiss. And then, a few doors down, \u201cWe pulled the guy out, put him in the truck, and were gone, done. \u201d The military is very good at identifying and amplifying the psychological factors that make a   fighter. The Pentagon has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on testing and analyzing these elements, but its researchers publish very few of their findings and refuse to speak in specifics on the record. Psychiatrists and psychologists who have worked with the military say the   mental profile is based largely on two   kinds of testing. One is a   questionnaire that assesses personality. The other test is intended to gauge performance. People who excel in combat tend to be assertive, active,   and enthusiastic. \u201cI hate to use the clich\u00e9, but these are guys who love to be at the tip of the spear,\u201d said a psychologist who works with the military he asked that his name be omitted to protect that relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s more than the camaraderie there\u2019s a need to protect life, directly  \u2014   and if necessary, to take life. \u201d The performance measure has more to do with attention and decision making. It is based in part on a theory of concentration \u201cstyles,\u201d developed by researchers studying athletes. \u201cThe classic analyst takes in the information and then retreats into their head and wants to think about it, then maybe checks the environment again and thinks some more,\u201d said Dr. Charles A. Morgan III, a psychiatrist at the University of New Haven who has worked extensively with Special Operations forces. The elite combat troops operate much differently, he said. \u201cThey immediately take in their surroundings they have a high degree of external focus. But they\u2019re able to switch internally, make a quick decision  \u2014   then act and adjust as they go. \u201d In training and in combat, this intense awareness and decision making become much sharper. \u201cEssentially the decision making and acting become second nature,\u201d said Bret Moore, the deputy director of the Army\u2019s Warrior Resiliency Program of the Regional Health   in San Antonio. \u201cYou do not want these guys thinking too much. \u201d That may help explain the recent suicide findings. The research team, led by Dr. Kessler of Harvard and Dr. Robert Ursano of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, analyzed 496 suicides among men in the Army from 2004 to 2009. The risks for two jobs  \u2014   infantryman and combat engineer  \u2014   were higher across the board, at 37 per 100, 000 each year. But the rate was 30 per 100, 000 while deployed, compared with 40 per 100, 000 when back home. The rate across the rest of the Army was much lower at home, 15 per 100, 000, compared with during deployment, where it was 22 per 100, 000. \u201cThese are the guys, we think, who are getting into fights, or in trouble with the law, who are impulsive and don\u2019t manage well when they\u2019re back in a civilian world that seems boring and frustrating,\u201d Dr. Kessler said. Mr. Lundeby had the makings of a combat soldier from an early age. Growing up in Modesto, Calif. the younger of two brothers, he was mostly easygoing  \u2014   a Boy Scout, a driven athlete  \u2014   but for a sensitivity to injustices, small and large. \u201cHe had this intense sense of what was fair and just, and he would go toe to toe\u201d with anyone, said his mother, Vicky Lundeby. \u201cHe had to be the one to make things right. \u201d That quality left him feeling bored and disconnected after high school, studying graphic arts at a local community college. The news coming out of Iraq in 2003 put him in motion: He signed up for the Army Reserve, then the National Guard. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina landed his Guard unit in New Orleans, working for a month to contain looting and help people evacuate to safety. \u201cI decided, right there,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to do this every day. \u201d \u201cKatrina changed him,\u201d said his father, Luther. \u201cI feel like it gave him that purpose he wanted. \u201d Ryan Lundeby joined the Army and soon set his sights on the Rangers, beginning an intense training regimen. In 2007, he deployed for the first time, to Iraq. \u201cIt felt like Christmas finally, a chance to do this for keeps. \u201d But returning home for good in 2010, he was a man on constant patrol. He raged at fellow drivers whom he considered rude or careless. He confronted litterers, often by picking up the offending cigarette butt or   wrapper and throwing it in their faces. When a driver cut off Mary, then his fianc\u00e9e, on her way home from work, he jumped on his motorcycle in nothing but running shorts and prowled the neighborhood to make the man pay. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done if I\u2019d found him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I feel like that\u2019s what happens to guys. You react  \u2014   and next thing you know, the police are there. \u201d The combat veterans in this category form \u201ca pretty closed club,\u201d said Ford Sypher, a friend of Mr. Lundeby\u2019s and a fellow Ranger, who deployed five times and, after leaving the Army, has returned to the Middle East, now as a documentary filmmaker. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about this stuff much with anyone. But we\u2019re all trying to figure out ways to manage it. \u201d For now, there is no therapy that reliably reverses or dials down the instincts acquired in multiple combat tours.   researchers are experimenting with a variety of approaches for these veterans, including virtual reality and biofeedback techniques, in effect to train new instincts that overwrite the old ones. There are psychologists who argue that vigilance, snap decision making and other combat attributes can be helpful in some aspects of civilian life. \u201cYou begin by letting people know that they\u2019re not crazy, it\u2019s not at all abnormal to have these reactions  \u2014   it\u2019s normal,\u201d said Richard Tedeschi, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, who works with veterans. And those skills, he added, \u201ccan be turned to a future mission, whether that\u2019s related to family, or helping other vets, or to a job. \u201d Mr. Lundeby has been lucky. He has a supportive family and group of friends, and a wife who understands his quirks and helps him manage them. She was the one who demanded he visit a veterans clinic, which led to therapy with a former Marine who understood how to get him to think before acting  \u2014   even if the urge was strong. \u201cHe got me to ask, \u2018Do I have time to do this  \u2014   to right every wrong? \u2019\u201d said Mr. Lundeby, who several months ago landed his first   job, at a helicopter manufacturer. \u201cAnd he got me to see the humanity of the people I was confronting. \u201d \u201cSo I may always be a Ranger, in some ways,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve stopped trying to be the world\u2019s sheriff. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628524.4271142}
