I am a private citizen and I have a right to believe in my own political point of view, but I try not to get up on a soapbox and tell people how to think,\u201d Joel said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to shows where people start haranguing the audience about what\u2019s going on politically and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018You know, this isn\u2019t why I came here,\u2019\u201d the singer explained. \u201cAs a matter of fact, one of the biggest cheers of the night comes when we do \u2018Piano Man\u2019 and I sing, \u2018They know that it\u2019s me that they\u2019re coming to see to forget about life for a while,\u2019 and the audience lets out this huge \u2018ahhhh\u2019 and I say, \u2018OK, yeah, don\u2019t forget that. \u2019\u201d The     who\u2019s scored   hits and has toured the world for five decades, did say that he is \u201cstill flabbergasted\u201d that Donald Trump won the White House. Joel joins the likes of actor Mark Wahlberg and  Transformers: The Last Knight star Josh Duhamel, who recently told Fox News: \u201cI don\u2019t like to get involved politically at all. Nobody cares what I think politically. \u201d Joel has a residency at Madison Square Garden, a post he calls the \u201cgreatest gig in the world. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m doing a residency at the world\u2019s greatest arena  \u2014   I mean what\u2019s better than that?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our fourth year and it\u2019s still selling out. I thought it would kind of dissipate. But so far there hasn\u2019t been any indication of that. When there is then we\u2019ll probably stop. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742561802.3781898}
