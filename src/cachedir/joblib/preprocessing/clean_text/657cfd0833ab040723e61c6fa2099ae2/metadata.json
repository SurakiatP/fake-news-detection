They pretend Trump\u2019s win is a victory for bigots, instead of a defeat for the aristocracy (\u2018Wall Street\u2019, \u2018The Establishment\u2019, or America\u2019s billionaires and their agents such as lobbyists and the leading politicians). \\nHowever, a close look at the evidence shows Huffington Post to be wrong: Trump\u2019s win was overwhelmingly driven by Americans\u2019 repudiation of the aristocracy itself (such as, for example, repudiation of the Institute that runs Huffington Post\u2019s neoconservative international edition, World Post , the Berggruen Institute (including Eric Schmidt , Lawrence Summers , Fareed Zakaria , Arianna Huffington, Nicholas Berggruen , Ernesto Zedillo , Carl Bildt, Niall Ferguson, and Joseph Nye, all being proponents of Obama\u2019s building war against Russia \u2014 such as: \u201cTo confront Putin, Europe will have to make changes that will be deeply controversial on a continent long committed to environmentalism and marked by an aversion to the use of force\u201d). And, as far as global warming is concerned, which is a real problem about Trump, it\u2019s also very much and demonstrably \u2014 not merely in words \u2014 a real problem about Hillary too (and one that back in July 2015 before the Party nominees had been chosen, even was courageously reported by some of HuffPo\u2019s own reporters ), but HuffPo and other Democratic Party propagandists pretend there\u2019s reason to believe that Trump\u2019s actions would be even worse than hers have been, and HuffPo\u2019s readers thus end up being little else than Democratic Party suckers who feel satisfied in their \u2018news\u2019 reading to soak up what is almost entirely Democratic Party propaganda, which means the propaganda emanating out of the White House whenever a Democrat resides there \u2014 sort of like a Democratic Party version of the Republican Party\u2019s Fox \u2018News\u2019. \\nThe aristocracy (all of it, both its Republican and its Democratic Party branches) continue their campaign, and expect to crush their opposition \u2014 the public (of all parties). And that\u2019s what a close look at the evidence shows explains Trump\u2019s win \u2014 not bigotry on the part of the American public. Bigotry is a huge problem in every society, but especially amongst the aristocracy, who love to pretend that it\u2019s mainly a problem \u2018down below\u2019 \u2014 so that they can continue to exploit the public while claiming to be superior to it. That\u2019s the Big Lie, which Obama and the Clintons \u2014 and Huffington Post \u2014 promote and get paid very well to promote. \\nTheir campaign never ends. Only the personnel do.
