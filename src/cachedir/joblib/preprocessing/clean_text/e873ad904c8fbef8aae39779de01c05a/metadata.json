It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \\nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democrat and Republican Primaries.

Even if Trump is getting more social engagement than Obama in 2008, that certainly doesn\u2019t mean all those social media users will be voting for him. He explained it to CNBC like this: \\nRai said that his system would be improved by more granular data. He said that If Google was to give him access to the unique internet addresses assigned to each digital device, then he could collect data on exactly what people were thinking. For example, Rai said if someone was searching for a YouTube video on how to vote, then looked for a video on how to vote for Trump, this could give the AI a good idea of the voter's intention. He added that there would be no privacy concerns as these internet addresses would be anonymized. \\nThat being said, Rai advised the Clinton campaign not to get complacent in light of the AI's prediction. \""}, "time": 1742562046.9478052}
