The way she acted next could have landed a normal person in jail. However, because Weiss is a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s department, that will likely not happen. \\nWhen Weiss noticed that her truck was being towed, she jumped into another vehicle and then drove the wrong way down a one-way street to block the driver in who had towed her car. \\nWhen she exits the vehicle, according to the tow truck driver, she had her gun drawn. When he saw the gun, the driver pulled out his camera phone and began to record. \\n\u201cI\u2019m a cop. Drop my truck,\u201d yelled Weiss. \\n\u201cYou need to put your gun away,\u201d replied the driver. \\n\u201cYou see a gun?\u201d Weiss asked, acting as if she didn\u2019t have one once she saw the camera. \\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s in your pocket,\u201d the driver said. \\n\u201cI am a cop,\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to f**king jail for stealing my car.\u201d \\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to jail,\u201d the driver responded. \\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Weiss said before storming off to wait for backup. \\nWhen deputies arrived on scene, they confirmed that Weiss did, in fact, have a gun. \\n\u201cShe had a gun in her hand pointed at me,\u201d said the driver. \\nIn a small victory for the driver, the deputies refused to back up Weiss and allowed him to tow the truck as he was well within the law to do so. Also, instead of the normal impound fee of $62.50, Weiss had to pay double as she held the driver up for more than 15 minutes. \\nAfraid that deputies may single him out later, the tow truck driver chose to remain anonymous. But he did say that had Weiss approached him calmly he would have gladly given her the truck back free of charge. \\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I was even more shocked that I was seeing that kind of behavior from a deputy. That would be the last person I would expect to be behaving that way,\u201d the driver said. \u201cI expected a little bit different from a professional. (They\u2019re someone) that\u2019s supposed to be trained to handle situations like this.\u201d \\nAccording to a report obtained by WFTV, Weiss is no angel. Weiss\u2019 disciplinary record revealed she was suspended in 2008 for violating OCSO\u2019s use of authority policy. \\nWeiss was suspended for 21 hours without pay after she was accused of acting inappropriately regarding a business arrangement, the Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s said. \\nAccording to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, the incident is now under an internal investigation, but there will not be a full report until the investigation is complete.
