[USNI News reports the Iranian boats came within 900 yards of the Mahan, which was escorting two U. S. ships through the Strait of Hormuz, the amphibious assault ship USS Makin Island and a fleet oiler.  The Iranian group consisted of four fast inshore attack craft, approaching at a high rate of speed with their   weapons manned, according to a U. S. official. \u201cAfter several attempts to warn off the boats with radio communications, siren and the ship\u2019s whistle the boats came within 900 yards of the guided missile destroyer before the crew fired three warning shots from one of the ships . 50 caliber,\u201d USNI News writes. \u201cA helicopter from Makin Island also deployed a smoke screen generator, a   \u201csmoke float\u201d that did not deter the IRGCN boats. \u201d The UK Guardian clarifies that radio communication with the Iranians was established, but they ignored requests to slow down and \u201ccontinued asking the Mahan questions. \u201d The U. S. Navy described the Iranians\u2019 behavior as \u201cunsafe and unprofessional. \u201d The U. S. official quoted by the Guardian said the Mahan had a total of seven \u201cinteractions\u201d with vessels from Iran over the weekend, but the other six were \u201cjudged to be safe. \u201d As with several previous tense encounters, the boats were under the command of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) which is separate from the Iranian Navy, reports directly to the theocratic government, and is given great discretion to \u201cboldly and courageously\u201d defend the Iranian coastline.'"}, "time": 1742564030.722899}
