She had been summoned to a lunch meeting with her    and his lawyer to review a prenuptial agreement. It required that, should the couple split, she return everything  \u2014   cars, furs, rings  \u2014   that Mr. Trump might give her during their marriage. Sensing her sorrow, Mr. Trump apologized, Ivana Trump later testified in a divorce deposition. He said it was his lawyer\u2019s idea. \u201cIt is just one of those Roy Cohn numbers,\u201d Mr. Trump told her. The year was 1977, and Mr. Cohn\u2019s reputation was well established. He had been Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s   consigliere. He had helped send the Rosenbergs to the electric chair for spying and elect Richard M. Nixon president. Then New York\u2019s most feared lawyer, Mr. Cohn had a client list that ran the gamut from the disreputable to the  : Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, Claus von Bulow, George Steinbrenner. But there was one client who occupied a special place in Roy Cohn\u2019s famously cold heart: Donald J. Trump. For Mr. Cohn, who died of AIDS in 1986, weeks after being disbarred for flagrant ethical violations, Mr. Trump was something of a final project. If Fred Trump got his son\u2019s career started, bringing him into the family business of   rentals in Brooklyn and Queens, Mr. Cohn ushered him across the river and into Manhattan, introducing him to the social and political elite while ferociously defending him against a growing list of enemies. Decades later, Mr. Cohn\u2019s influence on Mr. Trump is unmistakable. Mr. Trump\u2019s wrecking ball of a presidential bid  \u2014   the gleeful smearing of his opponents, the embracing of bluster as brand  \u2014   has been a Roy Cohn number on a grand scale. Mr. Trump\u2019s response to the Orlando massacre, with his ominous warnings of a terrorist attack that could wipe out the country and his conspiratorial suggestions of a Muslim fifth column in the United States, seemed to have been ripped straight out of the Cohn playbook. \u201cI hear Roy in the things he says quite clearly,\u201d said Peter Fraser, who as Mr. Cohn\u2019s lover for the last two years of his life spent a great deal of time with Mr. Trump. \u201cThat bravado, and if you say it aggressively and loudly enough, it\u2019s the truth  \u2014   that\u2019s the way Roy used to operate to a degree, and Donald was certainly his apprentice. \u201d For 13 years, the lawyer who had infamously whispered in McCarthy\u2019s ear whispered in Mr. Trump\u2019s. In the process, Mr. Cohn helped deliver some of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature construction deals, sued the National Football League for conspiring against his client and countersued the federal government  \u2014   for $100 million  \u2014   for damaging the Trump name. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s executives recalled that he kept an     photograph of Mr. Cohn in his office desk, pulling it out to intimidate recalcitrant contractors. The two men spoke as often as five times a day, toasted each other at birthday parties and spent evenings together at Studio 54. And Mr. Cohn turned repeatedly to Mr. Trump  \u2014   one of a small clutch of people who knew he was gay  \u2014   in his hours of need. When a former companion was dying of AIDS, he asked Mr. Trump to find him a place to stay. When he faced disbarment, he summoned Mr. Trump to testify to his character. Mr. Trump says the two became so close that Mr. Cohn, who had no immediate family, sometimes refused to bill him, insisting he could not charge a friend. \u201cRoy was an era,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview, reflecting on his years with Mr. Cohn. \u201cThey either loved him or couldn\u2019t stand him, which was fine. \u201d Mr. Trump was asked if this reminded him of anyone. \u201cYeah,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt does, come to think of it. \u201d The gossip columnist Cindy Adams, who knew everyone, had no idea who he was. \u201cThis kid is going to own New York someday,\u201d Mr. Cohn told her, gesturing at a tall   bachelor at a dinner party in the early 1970s. \u201cThis is Donald Trump. \u201d \u201cYeah, so?\u201d Ms. Adams recalled replying. Mr. Cohn, the son of a prominent New York judge, had taken an uncommon interest in Mr. Trump. The two had met not long before at a private disco called Le Club, and instantly hit it off while discussing a nettlesome obstacle for Mr. Trump. The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department was suing him and his father, accusing them of refusing to rent to black tenants. Mr. Trump told Mr. Cohn that their lawyers were urging them to settle. \u201cTell them to go to hell and fight the thing in court,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump later recalled Mr. Cohn advising him. Mr. Trump did just that, with Mr. Cohn as his lawyer. Not only did Mr. Cohn countersue the government for $100 million, he filed a blistering affidavit on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, mocking the case. \u201cThe Civil Rights Division did not file a lawsuit,\u201d Mr. Cohn wrote. \u201cIt slapped together a piece of paper for use as a press release. \u201d The Trumps ultimately settled the case by agreeing to make apartments available to minority renters, while admitting no wrongdoing. For Mr. Trump, the benefits of his new representation were obvious. Mr. Cohn was one of the most famous and feared lawyers in America. He would later appear on the cover of Esquire beneath an ironic halo, and earn a posthumous parody on \u201cThe Simpsons. \u201d But Mr. Cohn saw something in Mr. Trump, too. \u201cHe could sniff out a    Roy could,\u201d said Susan Bell, Mr. Cohn\u2019s longtime secretary. After helping convict the Rosenbergs as a young federal prosecutor and then working in Washington as a top aide to McCarthy, Mr. Cohn had returned to New York, starting a boutique practice in his shabby but elegant townhouse on East 68th Street. The division of labor in the firm was clear. \u201cWe called him the rainmaker,\u201d said Michael Rosen, a partner who handled many of the firm\u2019s   cases. \u201cWe did all of the grunt work, if grunt work means preparing the case and trying the case. \u201d Mr. Cohn lived on the third floor, often traipsing downstairs in his bathrobe well after the workday had begun and taking clients upstairs to a small sun porch. The elevator rarely worked. In the winter, the lawyers stuffed towels around the windows to keep out the cold. Parties and business meetings tended to blur, with celebrities like Andy Warhol and Est\u00e9e Lauder crowding in and spilling out. \u201cThat townhouse was a workhorse,\u201d recalled Mr. Trump, a familiar presence there himself. He and Mr. Cohn became social companions, lunching at \u201c21\u201d or spending evenings at Yankee Stadium in the owner\u2019s box of Mr. Steinbrenner, another Cohn client. After Mr. Fraser entered Mr. Cohn\u2019s life, the two were frequent dinner guests at Donald and Ivana\u2019s Trump Tower apartment, with its   murals. They were also regulars at Mr. Trump\u2019s box at the Meadowlands, the home of his sports team, the New Jersey Generals of the   United States Football League. Mr. Cohn was the master of ceremonies at a Trump birthday party at Studio 54 years later, Mr. Trump returned the favor with a birthday toast of his own at a party in the atrium of Trump Tower, joking that Mr. Cohn was more bark than bite. \u201cWe just tell the opposition Roy Cohn is representing me, and they get scared,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to a cousin of Mr. Cohn\u2019s, David L. Marcus, who attended. \u201cHe never actually does anything. \u201d Among the many things Mr. Trump learned from Mr. Cohn during these years was the importance of keeping one\u2019s name in the newspapers. Long before Mr. Trump posed as his own spokesman, passing   tidbits to gossip columnists, Mr. Cohn was known to call in stories about himself to reporters. It was also through Mr. Cohn that Mr. Trump met the political operative who has played a leading, if    role in his campaign: Roger Stone. When Mr. Stone, the roguish former Nixon adviser and master of the political dark arts, came to New York in 1979 to court support for Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential bid, he arrived with a box of index cards filled with the names of actors and producers. And Roy Cohn. \u201cI made an appointment and I pitched him on Reagan, and he said, \u2018You have to meet Donald and Fred Trump,\u2019\u201d Mr. Stone recalled in an interview. Eventually, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Trump became so inseparable that those who could not track down Mr. Cohn knew whom to call. Once, Mr. Cohn chartered a plane with friends, without Mr. Trump, trashing it during a midair party. He refused to pay. So the airline found Mr. Trump, asking if he could help. He called Mr. Cohn, more amused than concerned. \u201cI said, \u2018Roy, what are you going to do about this? I mean, you destroyed the plane,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Eh, we\u2019ll pay them someday. \u2019\u201d By the time Mr. Trump started getting serious with a Czech model named Ivana Winklmayr, Mr. Cohn had become something of an expert on marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine and admit that the flush of the moment may become the flush of the toilet as the relationship goes down the tubes,\u201d he wrote about the importance of prenuptial agreements in his book \u201cHow to Stand Up for Your Rights  \u2014   and Win!\u201d According to \u201cTrump: The Greatest Show on Earth,\u201d a book by the journalist Wayne Barrett, Mr. Cohn advised Mr. Trump against marrying Ms. Winklmayr, but insisted that if he must, there had to be a prenuptial agreement. He would handle it himself. The agreement, completed only weeks before the wedding, did not quantify Mr. Trump\u2019s net worth  \u2014   \u201cimpossible to accurately determine due to the illiquid nature of his holdings\u201d  \u2014   and took a bearish view of Mr. Trump\u2019s earning potential and a modest view of his tastes. \u201cDonald\u2019s standard of living is basically simple,\u201d it said, calling Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred lifestyle \u201cneither opulent nor extravagant. \u201d When the marriage dissolved a few years after Mr. Cohn\u2019s death, Mrs. Trump\u2019s lawyers charged that she had not had proper representation on the prenup. Her initial lawyer had worked for Mr. Cohn on at least one case, and was a frequent passenger on Mr. Cohn\u2019s yacht, the Defiance. The divorce case eventually ended with a settlement. The prenup was just one of many Trump deals, some more conventional than others, in which Mr. Cohn was intimately involved. He used his connections to help Mr. Trump secure zoning variances and tax abatements critical to the construction of the Grand Hyatt Hotel and the Trump Plaza. After one Cohn coup, Mr. Trump rewarded him with a pair of   cuff links and buttons in a Bulgari box. And if Mr. Cohn did not always feel comfortable charging a friend for his services, Mr. Trump was hardly one to put up a fight. \u201cRoy said, \u2018I\u2019ll leave it to Donald to give me what he thinks is fair,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fraser recalled of one lengthy Trump tax case in particular. \u201cBut, of course, Donald didn\u2019t give him anything. \u201d Some work would have been difficult to bill. For instance, Mr. Cohn lobbied his friends in the Reagan White House to nominate Mr. Trump\u2019s sister Maryanne Trump Barry to the federal bench. (Questioned last year about this, Mr. Trump said his sister \u201cgot the appointment totally on her own merit. \u201d) \u201cHe was a very good lawyer if he wanted to be,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview. Asked about Mr. Cohn in 1980, Mr. Trump was more blunt in his assessment: \u201cHe\u2019s been vicious to others in his protection of me. \u201d It started with a cut that would not stop bleeding. Mr. Cohn\u2019s diagnosis came not long after his former companion, Russell Eldridge, had gotten his. Mr. Eldridge had spent most of his final days in a private suite overlooking Central Park in Mr. Trump\u2019s Barbizon Plaza Hotel. Ms. Bell, Mr. Cohn\u2019s secretary, recalled that Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary, Norma Foerderer, had billed Mr. Cohn for the room, and later called to say that Mr. Cohn had not paid. \u201cI said, \u2018Guess what, Norma, he\u2019s not going to,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bell said. \u201cAnd she kind of knew it. \u201d Mr. Cohn remained in his townhouse. Until the end  \u2014   and even under interrogation by Mike Wallace on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d  \u2014   he insisted that he had liver cancer, not AIDS. He received experimental AZT treatments in Washington and continued working. But his clients could not help but notice that his health was deteriorating. Mr. Trump started gradually moving cases elsewhere, he said, never telling Mr. Cohn why. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to hurt somebody\u2019s feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was so weak,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cHe was so weakened that he really couldn\u2019t do it. \u201d Mr. Cohn never spoke about Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, but was plainly crushed, according to Ms. Bell. She remembers it happening not gradually, but \u201covernight. \u201d Even as his health was failing, Mr. Cohn, whom government prosecutors had unsuccessfully pursued for decades on charges including conspiracy, bribery and fraud, faced a final indignity: He was facing the prospect of disbarment. Among other offenses, he was charged with coercing a dying multimillionaire client  \u2014   during a   visit to the man\u2019s hospital room  \u2014   to amend his will to make Mr. Cohn an executor of his estate. The hearings were closed to the public. But true to form, Mr. Cohn, riding to the daily proceedings in a red Cadillac convertible, insisted on a spectacle, describing his accusers as \u201ca bunch of   just out to smear me up. \u201d The prominent figures whom Mr. Cohn summoned to testify on his behalf included Barbara Walters and William F. Buckley Jr. And, of course, Mr. Trump. He described his friend in simple terms. \u201cIf I summed it up in one word,\u201d Mr. Trump told the hearing panel, \u201cI think the primary word I\u2019d use is his loyalty. \u201d Gaunt, frail and besieged, Mr. Cohn nevertheless managed to attend a dinner with Mr. Fraser at    in Palm Beach, Fla. shortly after Mr. Trump purchased the property in late 1985. It was a last glimpse at his final,   project. \u201cI made Trump successful,\u201d he would occasionally boast, according to Mr. Marcus, Mr. Cohn\u2019s cousin, a former journalist who chronicled Mr. Cohn\u2019s last months for Vanity Fair. In June 1986, Mr. Cohn was disbarred for \u201cunethical,\u201d \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201cparticularly reprehensible\u201d conduct. To this day, Mr. Trump rues the outcome. \u201cThey only got him because he was so sick,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have gotten him otherwise. \u201d During his final days, Mr. Cohn called Mr. Trump, ostensibly for no particular reason. \u201cIt was just a call: \u2018How are things going? \u2019\u201d Mr. Trump recalled. \u201cRoy was the kind of guy  \u2014   I don\u2019t think he ever thought he was dying, frankly. \u201d About a week later, in August 1986, Mr. Trump received another call. Mr. Trump hung up the phone, repeating the news to an associate in his office: Roy Cohn was dead. \u201cI said, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s the end of a generation,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump remembered. \u201c\u2018That\u2019s the end of an era. \u2019\u201d Mr. Fraser inherited all of Mr. Cohn\u2019s possessions: the townhouse, his weekend place in Greenwich, Conn. his   his private plane and much more. But the Internal Revenue Service, collecting on Mr. Cohn\u2019s tax debts, confiscated nearly everything. He did get to keep the cuff links Mr. Trump had given Mr. Cohn. Years later, Mr. Fraser had them appraised they were knockoffs, he said. Mr. Fraser soon returned to his native New Zealand, where he now works as a conservationist at the Auckland Zoo. He has not spoken with Mr. Trump since Mr. Cohn\u2019s death, but he has no doubt that if his former lover were still alive, he would be an enthusiastic supporter of the Trump campaign. \u201cHaving trained or mentored someone who became president,\u201d he said, \u201cthat would have been quite exciting for Roy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561786.0917916}
