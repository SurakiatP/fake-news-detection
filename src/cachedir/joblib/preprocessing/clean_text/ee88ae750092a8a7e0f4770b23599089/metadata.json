What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022   Donald J. Trump is facing backlash over his choice of Stephen K. Bannon as his administration\u2019s chief strategist. The move elevates the   nationalist movement Mr. Bannon nurtured while running Breitbart News, a website whose staples include articles linking migrants to the spread of disease. Mr. Bannon said Mr. Trump\u2019s followers are patriots who are being tarred by the existence of racists and   \u201con the margins. \u201d Reports of racially charged assaults, graffiti attacks and other episodes have surged since Election Day, and the F. B. I. said that hate crimes rose 7 percent last year, driven by a rise in attacks against American Muslims. Many attacks have also been countered by acts of public support and solidarity. _____ \u2022 President Obama took questions from reporters for the first time since the election, portraying Mr. Trump as a pragmatist and stressing the importance of a peaceful transition. \u201cWithout copping out, I think it\u2019s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment\u201d on the choice of Mr. Bannon. Mr. Obama is about to fly to Greece, at the start of a final international tour that will also take him to Germany and Peru. He will try to soothe fears of the coming Trump presidency, but his leverage has been diminished and his legacy bruised. _____ \u2022 Mr. Trump continued to project his presidency onto the world stage. He spoke with Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Russia has embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s election. The State Duma, or parliament, broke into applause on news of his victory. Mr. Trump, who has threatened to confront China on a range of trade issues, promised Mr. Xi that the two nations would have \u201cone of the strongest relationships. \u201d _____ \u2022 Hong Kong\u2019s High Court ruled that two   politicians who were elected to the legislature cannot take their seats. Sixtus Leung, 30, known as Baggio, and Yau   25, set off the conflict by using what some consider a derogatory term for China when they took their oaths of office. Beijing reacted by issuing a new interpretation of Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law, challenging the territory\u2019s semiautonomous status. _____ \u2022 The International Criminal Court is considering a   investigation in Afghanistan, after a prosecutor said she had a \u201creasonable basis to believe\u201d that American soldiers there committed war crimes, including torture. \u2022 Samsung is spending $8 billion to acquire Harman International Industries, an American company best known for   car stereos, like   and JBL. The deal gives Samsung a stake in   connected cars, which could mean a boom in screens, computers and connectivity. Its stock rose 25. 6 percent. \u2022 Japan\u2019s G. D. P. figures surprised analysts with strong economic growth in the third quarter despite declining consumer prices and deflation. Our analyst looks at whether the trend will last. \u2022 The National Geographic Channel has reinvented itself under the leadership of James Murdoch at its parent, 21st Century Fox. Part of the makeover is a shift to   shows like \u201cMars,\u201d a new     by Ron Howard. \u2022 U. S. markets closed lower, and oil was down. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 A Malaysian lawmaker was given 18 months in prison for disclosing classified information from an official audit of a   investment fund linked to Prime Minister Najib Razak. [The New York Times] \u2022 The   venture capitalist Eric Li argues that relations between China and the U. S. may suffer over trade, but could improve if the U. S. stops trying to remake the world in its own image. [The New York Times] \u2022 Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, was questioned in London about a rape accusation in Sweden in 2010. [The New York Times] \u2022 President Rodrigo Duterte said that if Islamic State militants came to the Philippines, he would not let his \u201cpeople be slaughtered for the sake of human rights. \u201d [Reuters] \u2022 Japan\u2019s government plans to increase medical checkups for older drivers after a wave of fatal traffic accidents. [Asahi Shimbun] \u2022 If all the railways projects proposed for Southeast Asia were built, here is a map of how the region would look. [The Diplomat] \u2022 Canada\u2019s government is under scrutiny for blocking an arms deal with Thailand over factors including human rights abuses, just months after exporting $15 billion in combat vehicles to Saudi Arabia, which has a poorer rights record. [Globe and Mail] \u2022 China\u2019s nationalist resurgence is on display in \u201cThe Long March,\u201d above, a new opera about the early days of the Communist Party. [The New York Times] \u2022 Gwen Ifill, an   television journalist who moderated   debates in 2004 and 2008, died of cancer in Washington. She was 61. \u2022 And Pizza, the polar bear used to lure shoppers to a mall in southern China, will be temporarily moved while his   enclosure is \u201coptimized and upgraded. \u201d Animal rights groups say the move doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. Two Chinese astronauts expect to leave their space lab this week, after a monthlong stay that is a first for their nation. China has poured billions of dollars into its space program, aiming to rival the United States and Russia in reaching Mars. Such programs are enormous drivers of technological innovation. So it might come as a surprise to know that space communications rely on an old standby: radio waves. Speech from an astronaut, video from cameras and data from sensors flow into a transmitter, which emits radio waves picked up by a terrestrial receiver. Terrestrial transmitters reverse the favor. The same basic technology sends music to your radio, YouTube videos to your cellphone and photos from Pluto. There really isn\u2019t any alternative until we figure out how to use lasers to convey data. There\u2019s been a lot of   of radio capabilities over the 125 years or so that scientists have been playing with electromagnetic radiation. We have great antennas and efficient, secure encoding now. But the technology is also good for a simple call from home. Last week, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, called the space lab. \u201cEveryone across China cares very much about both of you,\u201d Mr. Xi said. One astronaut proudly said, \u201cI will go forth, and successfully complete the mission. \u201d Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting.  _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
