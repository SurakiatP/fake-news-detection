[Colleen Campbell, 28, said she is the one being targeted now after she claimed she was \u201cruined\u201d when the video of her   tirade went viral and caused her to lose her job as a reporter at PHL 17.  \u201cFrom the time the video was made public, Ms. Campbell has been the recipient of thousands of lewd and threatening phone calls, texts, messages, and emails ranging from angry, profane, and defamatory insults to deeply disturbing sexual and violent threats,\u201d Campbell family spokesman and attorney Wayne Pollock told the New York Post in a statement. \u201cMs. Campbell and her family are still sorting out the events of that night. Their highest priority is the health and   of Ms. Campbell. \u201d Pollock added that Campbell is trying to reach out to the Philadelphia police officer to offer an apology for her behavior. The video showed Campbell verbally lashing out at the officer while the officer just asked her to walk away. \u201cOr what? Or what, motherf \u2014  ker? Lick my a \u2014  hole,\u201d Campbell says in the video. \u201cHow about that? F \u2014  king piece of s \u2014  t.

The assault charges are in addition to the charges of resisting arrest, criminal mischief, and disorderly conduct that she already faces.

The Post reports that she later admitted to having five drinks, including two shots she consumed before the show and a few drinks she had while bartending at the Devil\u2019s Den in South Philadelphia earlier in the evening.'"}, "time": 1742561724.2158163}
