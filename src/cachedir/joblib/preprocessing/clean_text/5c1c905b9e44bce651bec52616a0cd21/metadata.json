The feds rounded up cattle at their father Cliven\u2019s ranch in 2014, alleging unpaid grazing fees, but they faced armed protesters. \\nThe brothers are part of a Nevada ranching family embroiled in a lengthy fight over the use of public range, and their occupation drew an international spotlight to a uniquely American West dispute: federal restrictions on ranching, mining and logging to protect the environment. The U.S. government, which controls much of the land in the West, says it tries to balance industry, recreation and wildlife concerns to benefit all. \\n\u201cWe are just so excited,\u201d Angie Bundy, Ryan\u2019s wife, told the Guardian after the verdict was announced. \u201cWe\u2019ve been praying hard, and we knew they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d \\nThe Post is reporting that the trial seemed like an open-and-shut case. There was no dispute that the group actually seized the refuge, established armed patrols, and vetted visitors. \\n\\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this case is not a whodunit,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Ethan Knight said in his closing argument, arguing that the group decided to take over a federal workplace that didn\u2019t belong to them. \\nBut federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case, finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized at the standoff, testifying to 16,636 live rounds and 1,700 spent casings were found. \\nDespite the evidence, the brothers were found not guilty, suggesting that the jury \u2013 along with the American people \u2013 are growing weary of continued government interference in local land use issues.'"}, "time": 1742562958.9990463}
