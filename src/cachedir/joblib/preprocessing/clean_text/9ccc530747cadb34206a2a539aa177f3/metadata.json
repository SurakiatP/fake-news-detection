It looks like the left is just going to blame \u201cfake news\u201d every time they lose their grip on power. \u2013 Gateway Pundit \\nThe elite is leveraging its \u201cpopulism versus globalism\u201d meme by declaring that populism is closely linked to \u201cfake news.\u201d \\nWe\u2019ve written numerous articles on the emergent elite meme, here and here, of \u201cpopulism versus globalism\u201d and warned that, \u201cThis meme is not only of the utmost importance, it is clearly warning us of considerable distress to come.\u201d \\nBut we didn\u2019t imagine the populist propaganda concept would be turned in the direction of fake news, though that\u2019s just what has happened \u2013 and most powerfully and suddenly. \\nMore: \\nAFP reported: German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Wednesday against the power of fake news on social media to spur the rise of populists, after launching her campaign for a fourth term. \\nSpeaking in parliament for the first time since her announcement Sunday that she would seek re-election next year, Merkel cautioned that public opinion was being \u201cmanipulated\u201d on the internet. \\nYes public opinion is being manipulated \u2013 as usual. In our view, elite controllers continued to circulate propaganda to frighten people and influence their thinking. \\nWe call their efforts \u201cdominant social themes\u201d \u2026 fear-based propaganda designed to convince people that they are running out of food, water, a stable climate, etc. The solution is inevitably more government \u2013 either domestically or globally. \\nElite themes reinforce people\u2019s inclination to look toward government \u2013 the bigger, the better \u2013 to protect them. The goal evidently is world domination via government that is inevitably controlled discreetly by elite forces. \\nAs a result of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, the elite-controlled mainstream media has lost no time in disseminating the term \u201cpopulist\u201d to describe the current rising, Western \u201cnationalism.\u201d \\nIt is even beyond nationalism, of course. The entire globalist structure is being challenged because it is has continued to grow significantly \u2013 stripping people of resources and wealth. \\nBut by defining \u201cpopulism\u201d on their terms, elites were able to create a contrasting meme \u2013 globalism \u2013 that could then be imbued with a variety of positive characteristics. \\nGlobalism, in contrast to populism, is to be seen as positive and prosperity enhancing \u2013 and only under attack because it has not distributed its benefits equally. \\nPopulism is presented as racist, greedy, insular and ignorant. \u201cFake news\u201d is being positioned by Merkel as bothersome and dangerous because it encourages this aberrant populism. \\nWhat\u2019s the goal? She says so herself: Government may have to regulate \u201cfake news\u201d so that it does not continue to create the growing scourge of \u201cpopulism.\u201d \\nMerkel, 62, said the challenge for democrats was to \u201creach and inspire people \u2014 we must confront this phenomenon and if necessary, regulate it.\u201d \\nSo now we can see how the \u201cpopulist\u201d meme is being deployed, to attack the alternative media in hopes of creating a groundswell of support for regulations that will control and retard it. \\nOf course it is perfectly possible to argue that this sort of manipulation does not exist in the manner described. But if one denies this paradigm, one has to address the question of why the \u201cpopulism versus globalism\u201d meme appeared suddenly in mid-summer, even before Trump won the election. \\nAnd then one needs to address why suddenly \u201cfake news\u201d is on the front page, collectively, of mainstream media with the inference that it is linked directly or indirectly to the growth of said populism. \\nAs the recent election showed us, the mainstream media is capable of reporting with a single voice, no matter how falsely, when its organizers have in mind to present a concept or opinion in a certain way. \\nThe fake news meme has developed inexorably out of \u201cpopulism\u201d propaganda and when looked at this way, one can see clearly that these various memes are programmatic. They are part of a mechanism designed to attack and blunt people\u2019s desperate anger with the growing power of globalism. \\nIt is even possible that some or much of the so-called fake news circulating has been secretly funded and generated by mainstream media controllers. \\nConclusion: No, it would seem there is nothing coincidental about the emergence of \u201cpopulism,\u201d nor of the subsequent emergence of the fake news meme. One can argue, as we have herein, that they are a kind of weaponized media manipulation. They are, in fact, serial elite psyops designed to manipulate the general public.'"}, "time": 1742628574.7359111}
