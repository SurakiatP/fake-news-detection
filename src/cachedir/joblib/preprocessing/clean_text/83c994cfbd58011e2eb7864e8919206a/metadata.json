[While he did not reject the invitation, either, he said he was \u201ctied up\u201d and could not \u201cmake any definite promise. \u201d  \u201cI\u2019m supposed to go to Russia, I\u2019m also supposed to go to Israel,\u201d Duterte noted. If Duterte accepts the invitation, it is unclear whether the State Department would grant him a visa to enter the United States. He has joked in the past that he refuses to even try to enter the country because \u201cI will just be insulted there\u201d and \u201cthey won\u2019t give me a visa. \u201d In October, he claimed to have once attempted to enter the United States when he was in college and was denied a visa, threatening to impose visa restrictions on U. S. citizens in revenge. Duterte is facing a case before the International Criminal Court for allegedly using \u201cdeath squads\u201d to curb   violence as mayor of his native Davao City, a position he held for 22 years before assuming the presidency. He has claimed to have personally participated in these death squads, wandering the city at night and shooting people dead. President Trump invited Duterte to the White House during a telephone conversation this weekend, a move that baffled observers who have noted Duterte\u2019s consistent   rhetoric since taking office in June 2016, as well as his record of supporting extrajudicial killings vigilante justice against drug criminals. The two world leaders reportedly engaged in a \u201cvery friendly conversation\u201d in which Trump offered to host Duterte in the White House. \u201cPresident Trump also invited President Duterte to the White House to discuss the importance of the United   alliance, which is now heading in a very positive direction,\u201d the White House said in a statement. The statement added that the two \u201cdiscussed the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world. \u201d While not endorsing Duterte\u2019s war on drugs, the statement did not condemn Duterte\u2019s efforts to rid the country of a methamphetamine (\u201cshabu\u201d) epidemic and the thousands of deaths occurring since he took office. Speaking to reporters Monday, Duterte echoed the warmth of the White House statement, adding that he had also mentioned growing tensions with North Korea. \u201cOur greatest chance there of getting some dialogue with America and North Korea would be through the intercession of China,\u201d he said. Duterte\u2019s civil exchanges with Trump stand in stark contrast to his relationship with the Obama administration. Duterte repeatedly referred to President Barack Obama as a \u201cson of a whore,\u201d told him to \u201cgo to hell,\u201d and vowed to sever ties between the United States and the Philippines. \u201cI\u2019ve realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to (President Vladimir) Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world  \u2014   China, Philippines and Russia. It\u2019s the only way,\u201d he said in October. On Monday, Duterte denied that those comments were a \u201cdistancing. \u201d \u201cIt was not a distancing but it was rather a rift between me maybe and the State Department and Mr. Obama, who spoke openly against me,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThings have changed, the new leadership wants to make friends. Well, things have changed, because the new leadership, he (Trump) wants to make friends and he says that we are friends. So, why do you have to pick a fight?\u201d he added. Duterte has presented a favorable disposition towards President Trump since the latter assumed office. In March, Duterte said in public remarks that he was \u201cokay with President Trump and I can assure him also of our friendship and cooperation. \u201d \u201cBut for the previous president, I was an evil man,\u201d he added at the time. \u201cThat crazy man was planning to jail me. This other one [Trump] he said, \u2018you\u2019re right. \u2019\u201d In the same remarks, he condemned the European Union for issuing a statement demanding Duterte cease to endorse police brutality against drug suspects, asking of the EU, \u201cwhy do you have to fuck with us?\u201d   media outlets and   commentators have condemned the White House invitation extended to Duterte. President Obama met with his Filipino counterpart in September at a regional summit despite claiming to have refused to do so, shaking his hand after Duterte had publicly referred to him as a \u201cson of a whore. \u201d \u201cIt was not a long interaction,\u201d Obama claimed. An anonymous official in the Trump White House similarly rejected the idea that meeting the head of state in person was an endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018thank you,\u2019 it\u2019s a meeting,\u201d the official told Reuters.'"}, "time": 1742628454.5890691}
