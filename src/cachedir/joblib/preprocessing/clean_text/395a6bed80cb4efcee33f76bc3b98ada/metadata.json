RELATED CONTENT \\nDeborah Giannecchini of Modesto, California was diagnosed with the disease in 2012 and accused the company of \u2018negligent conduct\u2019 in making and and marketing the baby powder. \\nThe lawsuit claimed Mrs Giannecchini contracted the disease after using baby powder in an intimate area. \\nJim Onder, Mrs Giannecchini\u2019s lawyer, said: \u2018We are pleased the jury did the right thing. They once again reaffirmed the need for Johnson & Johnson to warn the public of the ovarian cancer risk associated with its product.\u2019 \\nHowever, the company has rejected there is any risk to using their product \u2013 even in intimate areas \u2013 and will appeal the massive award. \\nCarol Goodrich, spokesman for the company said: \u2018We deeply sympathize with the women and families impacted by ovarian cancer. We will appeal today\u2019s verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.\u2019 \\nEarlier this year, two other lawsuits in St Louis ended in jury verdicts worth a combined $127million. But two others in New Jersey were thrown out by a judge who said there wasn\u2019t reliable evidence that talc leads to ovarian cancer, an often fatal but relatively rare form of cancer. \\nOvarian cancer accounts for about 22,000 of the 1.7million new cases of cancer expected to be diagnosed in the US this year. \\nAbout 2,000 women have filed similar suits, and lawyers are reviewing thousands of other potential cases, most generated by ads touting the two big verdicts out of St. Louis \u2013 a $72million award in February to relatives of an Alabama woman who died of ovarian cancer, and a $55million award in May to a South Dakota survivor of the disease. \\nMuch research has found no link or a weak one between ovarian cancer and using baby powder for feminine hygiene, and most major health groups have declared talc harmless. Johnson & Johnson, whose baby powder dominates the market, maintains it\u2019s perfectly safe. \\nBut Onder of the Onder Law Firm in suburban St Louis, which represented plaintiffs in all three St Louis cases, cited other research that began connecting talcum powder to ovarian cancer in the 1970s. \\nHe said case studies have indicated that women who regularly use talc on their genital area face up to a 40 per cent higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.'"}, "time": 1742628507.414611}
