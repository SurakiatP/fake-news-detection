You laid it out when those former CIA people said these things about Trump, that he was a recruited agent of the Russians, and a useful fool, they started this in Trump\u2019s mind, He knows the old adage, once a CIA man, always a CIA man. No one came out and said those people shouldn\u2019t be saying those things, So act two is the briefing when this dossier is put out. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve lived in this world for 45 years where you get things and people make allegations, that is a garbage document,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt never should have been presented as part of an intelligence briefing. As you suggested, other channels have the White House counsel give it to Trump\u2019s incoming White House counsel. So Trump\u2019s right to be upset about that. I  think if you look at the real chronology and the nature of the battle here, those intelligence chiefs who were the best we had, who are terrific and have done great work. I think they made a mistake here. And when people mistakes, they should apologize. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561683.0769525}
