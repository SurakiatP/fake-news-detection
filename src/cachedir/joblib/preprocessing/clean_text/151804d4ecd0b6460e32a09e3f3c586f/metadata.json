Europe\u2019s competition enforcer said that Apple\u2019s illegal deals with the Irish government allowed the technology giant to pay virtually nothing on its European business in some years. The arrangements enabled Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to a \u201chead office\u201d with \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities,\u201d the commission said. By doing so, Apple paid only 50 euros in taxes for every million euros in profit during 2014. As part of its ruling, Europe demanded that Ireland recoup 10 years\u2019 worth of back taxes, some 13 billion euros, or about $14. 5 billion, plus interest. The amount is a drop in the bucket for Apple, which has a total cash pile of more than $230 billion. Even so, the company described the order as a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to the rule of law. The United States Treasury Department said it jeopardized \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the U. S. and the E. U. \u201d Since taking over as competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has made tax avoidance a central focus, a campaign that has also ensnared Starbucks in the Netherlands, Amazon in Luxembourg and   InBev in Belgium. The United States Treasury, one of the most vocal critics of these moves, has said that Europe is overstepping its power, unfairly targeting American companies and hurting global efforts to curtail tax avoidance. The United States government is an unlikely advocate. Politicians have berated Apple for paying too little by setting up complex and opaque tax structures. Officials have hit back against corporate mergers that allowed companies to move their headquarters to places like Ireland to take advantage of lower tax rates. But the positioning in the Apple case reflects a political tug of war over big profitable companies, their potential tax bounty and the rights to regulate them. \u201cU. S. companies are the grandmasters of tax avoidance,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cNevertheless, because of the nature of U. S. politics,\u201d he said, the Apple case \u201cwill be framed by the U. S. as Europe overreaching and discriminating against \u2018our team. \u2019\u201d Since early this year, Ms. Vestager and Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, and their teams have met regularly to discuss Europe\u2019s   tax investigations. Mr. Lew visited Brussels in July to put forward the American perspective. Last week, the Treasury Department released a report criticizing any moves to recoup back taxes from American companies. Politicians also chimed in after the Apple decision. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called it a \u201ccheap money grab\u201d by the European Commission, \u201ctargeting U. S. businesses and the U. S. tax base. \u201d The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, said that the decision \u201cencroaches on U. S. tax jurisdiction. \u201d Apple and Ireland had similar defenses. Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of the technology company, said that Europe\u2019s ruling had \u201cno basis in fact or in law,\u201d and called it an effort to \u201crewrite Apple\u2019s history in Europe, ignore Ireland\u2019s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process. \u201d The company called the effective tax rate \u201ca completely   number. \u201d The Finance Ministry of Ireland said that the commission\u2019s decision would undermine a continuing global tax overhaul and create business uncertainty. The ministry said that taxes were a \u201cfundamental matter of sovereignty. \u201d Ireland and Apple both said they intended to fight Europe\u2019s decision, even though any appeals process could take years. The commission said the amount due in Ireland could be reduced if the American authorities decided that Apple should have paid more tax in the United States. Other countries in the European Union could also potentially take a share. \u201cThe ultimate goal should of course be that all companies, big or small, pay tax where they generate their profits,\u201d the competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager, said at a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday. \u201cWe need a change in corporate philosophies and the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency. \u201d Although the United States appears to side with Apple and Ireland in this specific fight, the overall view is a bit more complicated. A United States Senate committee said in 2013 that Apple had negotiated a special corporate tax rate of 2 percent or less in Ireland. While the committee did not accuse Apple of breaking any laws, lawmakers criticized the \u201cgimmicks,\u201d \u201cschemes\u201d and complex corporate structures that allowed the company to sidestep taxes. The public scrutiny and the emergence of previously confidential information about Apple\u2019s tax arrangements, in part, helped spark Europe\u2019s own investigation into the issue. Apple and other companies have also faced criticism for keeping large reserves of cash overseas. The money is not taxed at home until it is brought back to the parent company in the United States. Nonfinancial American companies hold a combined $1. 7 trillion in cash overseas, according to the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s. Just the international piece of Apple\u2019s stash amounts to nearly $215 billion. Ireland has faced broad scrutiny for its tax appeal. In a matter separate from the Apple case, the United States Treasury has taken aggressive steps to curtail   inversions, a tax move that has significantly benefited Ireland. Under those merger deals, an American company would buy an overseas counterpart and shift its headquarters overseas to lower its taxes. Ireland, with its low corporate tax rate, has been an especially big winner with inversions. Such financial maneuvers helped  plump up the country\u2019s economy, which grew at a breakneck 26. 3 percent last year. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, at 12. 5 percent, is one of the lowest in the developed world. Other incentives and breaks allow companies to cut their bills even further. While it is phasing out some of the more contested loopholes, Ireland has just introduced a new break for profit on intellectual property, a potentially huge benefit to large technology companies with troves of patents. \u201cMany member states are not unhappy about the European Commission\u2019s investigations,\u201d said Philipp Werner, a competition lawyer at Jones Day in Brussels. \u201cThey may help to close down tax havens. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628561.4651163}
