The GOP nominee has been the chief proponent of what is now known as \u201cbirtherism.\u201d And yet when asked about the matter, Trump tries to shift the blame to Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff in the 2008 Democratic race. \\nNow, however, we have proof that Trump was indeed the driving force of birtherism, and that proof comes from the mouth of his son, Eric. \\nNBC news found audio of Eric Trump talking to biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio, author of The Truth About Trump . In that audio, the Trump son admits: \u201cI think with the birthers it\u2019s, \u2018Okay, well, then, just prove it. Meaning these people are going out saying that which a lot of people were at the time. \u2018Then just show us. Just be transparent. You\u2019re the leader of the free world, be transparent.\u2019 There are underlying themes to this, and in fact, he has done his best to start the conversation that was unwilling to be had before. Now that conversation might flush itself out in one of several different ways. But at least the conversation is being had.\u201d \\nYes, at least we are trying to question the nationality of the first African-American President in the history of the United States. Nothing nefarious or the least bit racist about that, is there? Bullshit! Donald Trump knew exactly what he was doing when he repeatedly called for President Obama to release his birth certificate, and he did so to garner media attention as he considered running for the GOP nomination years before he finally did. \\nDonald Trump is a lying weasel and racist asshat who needs to be defeated soundly on November 8. He and his hateful ideas must be resoundingly rejected by the American people, who deserve better than the division he offers. \\nFeatured Image Via YouTube Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
