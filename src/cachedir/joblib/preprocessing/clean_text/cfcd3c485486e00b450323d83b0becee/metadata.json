I said he would forever change how you view reality. I\u2019ll prove that to you today with a fun experiment. \\nAt the end of this post I will give you a link to a very short video clip showing Hillary Clinton getting off her jet and into her car. Trump supporters will say she looks like she is drunk, or unsteady for some other health-related reason. And they will say it is obvious . Now try showing the clip to a Clinton supporter and watch how they see nothing wrong with the way she is walking. \\nWho is right? \\nThe answer is that you have no way to know. Personally, I can see it both ways, depending on what frame of mind I\u2019m in. When people on Twitter say she looks drunk, and I look at the clip immediately after they prime me, she indeed looks drunk. When my Clinton-supporting friend says he sees nothing unusual about her walking, suddenly it looks fine to me too. \\nMost of my readers today are probably Trump supporters, so you are likely to see Clinton\u2019s walk as unsteady. Send the clip to your Clinton-supporting friend and see how much your perceptions differ on this. You\u2019ll be amazed. \\nThere might be an objective reality in our world. But our brains didn\u2019t evolve to be able to see it. Our brains only evolved to do the job of keeping us alive so we could procreate. That means the reality you see \u2013 the movie in your head \u2013 can be totally different from mine, and almost certainly is. Yet we can both get by in this world. \\nLast year, when many observers were saying Trump was a stupid, under-informed clown, I was saying he was a Master Persuader. Pundits said he ignored facts because he didn\u2019t know them or because he was a liar. I said he ignored facts because facts are useless for persuasion. Trump could learn lots of facts if he wanted to do so. But he knew it was a waste of time. These are two totally different views of reality. And yet they did not conflict. Clinton supporters still see the stupid, under-informed clown and I still see the Master Persuader. We live in totally different movies and yet we can still interact with each other, still eat and drink, still procreate when necessary. \\nReality isn\u2019t what you thought it was a year ago. Your movie isn\u2019t my movie. But the good news is that you have the power to rewrite the coming scenes of your movie. And those scenes can be anything that isn\u2019t ruled out by your own observations. \\nNow watch this Clinton video and notice how Clinton\u2019s walk matches your expectations, no matter what your expectations are. That\u2019s confirmation bias . And it is the most important thing you will ever learn. SF Source The Burning Platform Nov. 2016 Share this:'"}, "time": 1742563941.5319536}
