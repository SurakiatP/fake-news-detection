Many, even on the left, slammed Reid as a conspiracy nut for suggesting the FBI was sitting on information explicitly linking Russia and Trump. Left-leaning New Republic was particularly brutal: Republicans are right: Hary Reid should be ashamed of himself . \\nInstead, he\u2019s been vindicated. \\nJust one day after making the remarks, several explosive stories dropped coming from entirely separate journalists that document several ways in which Trump is tied to Russia \u2013 and the FBI knows about it. \\nAccording to a report by NBC News, the FBI is making \u201cpreliminary inquiry\u201d into Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort for his ties to Russian businesses. Trump himself is rumored to have business interests linked to Russia \u2013 but has thus far refused calls to release his tax returns to disprove it. Even more critically, Mother Jones spoke to an unnamed counterintelligence officer who said that the FBI has more information than they are letting on. \\n\u2026a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump\u2014and that the FBI requested more information from him. \\nAccording to the informant, the \u201cRussian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.\u201d This aligns with what many intelligence experts in the U.S. have suspected, as well. Putin doesn\u2019t want Trump because he thinks he can work with him, he wants Trump because his presidency would tear American democracy apart at the seams. In the power vacuum that would ensue, Russia would then hope to capitalize on it geopolitically. Not a bad plan considering Trump has repeatedly demonstrated he is a moron when it comes to foreign policy. \\nUnlike Clinton, however. The FBI has clearly taken pains to keep this investigation out of the public eye. In a sardonic twist, they even cite privacy as the reason why they can\u2019t comment, leading Democratic congressman Adam Schiff to note : \\n\u201cAny specifics of what the FBI or intelligence agencies may be looking at are not something that the bureau should be discussing publicly,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBut here, where the director has discussed an investigation involving one candidate, it opens the director up to claims of bias if he doesn\u2019t discuss other potential investigations.\u201d \\nMeanwhile, Trump appears content to flaunt his love affair with Russia. On the very same day that Reid unloaded on him, the Republican candidate told a rally that he planned to work closely with Putin. Trump: \"Wouldn\u2019t it be nice? Wouldn\u2019t it be smart?\" To \u201cput everything together with Putin\" and Russia? \\n\u2014 Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) October 31, 2016 \\nWow is right. \\nFeatured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562265.8429976}
