Today, as I listened live to his State of the State address, I couldn\u2019t help but thinking that Brown sure sounds like he wishes he ran in 2016. [After swearing in Xavier Becerra as the new California Attorney General, to replace the seat vacated by   Senator Kamala Harris ( ) Governor Brown launched into what sounded much more like an opening bid for a presidential campaign against Donald Trump, rather than the bitterly   tirade most expected after reading the title of his speech: \u201cCalifornia is Not Turning Back, Not Now, Not Ever. \u201d  Even though the word \u201cTrump\u201d was not in the speech, Brown\u2019s focus was unmistakeable.  Instead of addressing the real state of the state  \u2014   the faltering economy in what has become one of the most unfriendly states to business owners  \u2014   Brown bragged about how great California is, and threw down the gauntlet to Washington, D. C. He waxed poetic about how California is still the sixth largest economy in the world, and tied the future of the nation to California\u2019s destiny: \u201cWhen California does well, America does well  \u2026    when California hurts, America hurts. \u201d The   governor was surprisingly animated, upbeat and optimistic. Describing California as the \u201cbeacon of hope to the rest of the world,\u201d his short speech revisited what he described as California\u2019s successes of his past terms in office: All these items were received in the   chamber with raucous cheers and loud applause that seemed more appropriate at a campaign rally than the august Assembly chamber. At one point, Brown went uncharacteristically off script and again sounded like he wished he were president when claiming he would fight to defend for \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u201d funding. It is unclear how he plans to keep that promise, as leader of the state likely to have the least influence in the Trump administration. Gov. Brown went to great lengths to highlight and praise the role of immigrants in California\u2019s success, erasing the line between legal and illegal immigrant. When it came to the epic battle so many California Democrats have picked with President Trump, Brown\u2019s approach was more intellectual. He discussed how his family came to California, mentioned his father being governor 60 years ago, and  ending that reverie with an exhortation to fight the federal government with a \u201cspirit that will get us through the difficulties ahead. \u201d California\u2019s   governor reserved his toughest words for the \u201cnew oresident\u201d over climate change. Brown acknowledged the \u201cdeep divisions,\u201d stating that \u201calternative facts\u201d and \u201cattacks on science\u201d were deeply disturbing.   He warned that democracy is a   system, and that in the massive protests over the weekend, we \u201cwitnessed vast, inspiring fervor\u201d that represented the true heart of the people. In one moment that was classic Brown  \u2014   and perhaps why he earned the name \u201cMoonbeam\u201d  \u2014   he praised Trump for wanting to build roads, bridges and railroads (with a chuckle over the   rail debacle) and said in a whimsical way, sounding more like a hippie than governor of the largest state: \u201cAmen to that, brother!\u201d And that wasn\u2019t the only area where Brown sought to be seen as a leader of more than just his own party. At one point near the end of the speech, he called out his more vitriolic colleagues to accept \u201creality\u201d and work to be more respectful of \u201cRepublicans\u201d  \u2014   who really are people, too. But that\u2019s not likely to distract many Californians from the stark reality of what was once their California dream. Brown inadvertently revealed the true state of the state  \u2014     overtaxed, and over committed to the point it cannot even repair the state highways or pay out pensions owed without levying yet another tax. Surprisingly, Brown acknowledged federal supremacy in the area of immigration, but then highlighted how California has staked out protections for \u201cundocumented Californians,\u201d reiterating his commitment to defy any enforcement of federal law that threatens illegal aliens in the state. Bragging that California had become a sanctuary state under the Trust Act  \u2014   which allows no criminal aliens to be turned over to federal authorities for deportation  \u2014   and granted drivers licenses for illegal aliens, as well as giving them   free college tuition, Brown made it clear he will defend the state he described as the \u201cGreat Exception. \u201d By acknowledging that Covered California (the state\u2019s version of ObamaCare) requires tens of billions in funding from the federal government, Gov. Brown gave President Trump an opening  \u2014   and revealed the Golden State\u2019s Achilles heel.  By repealing ObamaCare, and ending this massive subsidy, California\u2019s budget will fail. California may be an exceptional state in many ways, but it will not be the \u201cgreat exception\u201d when it comes to basic budget math. To borrow the governor\u2019s own words, you can\u2019t make 2 times 2 equal anything but 4  \u2014   not even in California. No wonder so many Americans are fleeing California for an \u201calternative reality\u201d  \u2014   one without Governor Jerry \u201cMoonbeam\u201d Brown.
