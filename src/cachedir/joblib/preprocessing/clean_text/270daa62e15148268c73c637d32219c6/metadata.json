They obviously get off on murdering innocent insects. This show should be banned from the air \u2013 it\u2019s disgusting\u201d. \\nLondon police were later called to disperse today\u2019s protesters as things got heated when one of the producers of the show tried to enter the ITV building in London situated in the south of the city. \\n\u201cTempers flared and several insect activists attacked and injured some three policemen, before overturning a car and burning it out,\u201d confirmed one officer. \\nITV confirmed that 2,345 cockroaches were killed in Australia during last night\u2019s episode, along with 456 mealworms and 17 spiders. One rat was also treated for shock and is said to be in a stable condition today at a local vet\u2019s surgery. \\nInsect rights groups have vowed to keep protesting the show\u2019s ongoing cruelty, and a million strong march is being organised for next week in central London.'"}, "time": 1742564560.35457}
