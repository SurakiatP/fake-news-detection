Williams of Baltimore City Circuit Court said as he pressed a prosecutor, Michael Schatzow, to explain whether his team had proved that Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. showed willful disregard for Mr. Gray\u2019s life by driving a police van dangerously through West Baltimore on a sunny April morning last year. Monday\u2019s closing arguments wrapped up a trial that has conjured vastly different pictures of Mr. Gray\u2019s ride in the police van and the exact timing of the injury, and left prosecutors treading carefully around the \u201crough ride,\u201d once a central piece of their case. \u201cWhen I said rough ride, I didn\u2019t talk about driving 100 miles per hour,\u201d Mr. Schatzow told the judge, who will render a decision on Thursday. \u201cI said he wasn\u2019t secured for the conditions in which the defendant drove. \u201d There were other questions. Could Mr. Gray have suffered his injuries in an accident? Was there evidence of elevated speed? And what, specifically, had Officer Goodson, who is also black, done to risk Mr. Gray\u2019s life? Mr. Schatzow said that Officer Goodson, 46, knew Mr. Gray was shackled, handcuffed but not seatbelted that the officer made a wide right turn and an unannounced stop and that he then failed to get medical care. \u201cThe intent is to bang him around,\u201d Mr. Schatzow said. \u201cThe consequences to the prisoner were worse than what he anticipated. \u201d Officer Goodson\u2019s lawyer, Matthew Fraling, argued that the officer did not intentionally endanger Mr. Gray. Instead, \u201cMr. Gray created a high degree of risk by removing himself from the prone position in which he had been placed to secure his transport,\u201d Mr. Fraling said, dismaying some activists watching in the courtroom. Most days, Officer Goodson, a   veteran of the Police Department, came to court in a suit with a gold tie clip and sat quietly without expression. He did not testify in his defense. His fate is now in the hands of Judge Williams. The death of Mr. Gray, 25, set off violent protest, looting and arson here and put the city at the center of the national debate over race, policing and the use of force. The city\u2019s top prosecutor, Marilyn J. Mosby, charged six officers with Mr. Gray\u2019s arrest and death, and she reserved the steepest charge  \u2014     \u201cdepraved heart\u201d murder  \u2014   for Officer Goodson. He faces six other charges, three of which are counts of manslaughter. The first trial, of Officer William G. Porter, ended with a hung jury in December. The second trial, of Officer Edward M. Nero, ended in an acquittal in May. Mr. Gray was arrested on April 12, 2015, after fleeing officers in the Sandtown neighborhood. He was eventually loaded, shackled and handcuffed, onto the floor of Officer Goodson\u2019s police wagon, which made several stops before it arrived at the Western District police station, where Mr. Gray was found unresponsive. His neck was broken and his spinal cord compressed he died a week later. Prosecutors introduced the rough ride theory during their opening statements, but it ran into hurdles when one of their witnesses said he had not seen the van make abrupt starts, stops or turns in his review of the evidence. Another witness, a policing expert, said he could not say whether a rough ride had occurred. In delivering her closing argument, a prosecutor, Jan Bledsoe, argued that Mr. Gray was injured between the second and fourth of six stops. She focused on what she said was Officer Goodson\u2019s duty to place a seatbelt on Mr. Gray and to seek medical attention after he asked for it at the van\u2019s fourth stop. \u201cOfficer Goodson never calls for a medic. He never takes Freddie Gray to the hospital,\u201d Ms. Bledsoe said. But she did not use the term \u201crough ride,\u201d and Mr. Fraling argued in his closing argument that prosecutors had tried to reshuffle their case when the evidence did not cut their way. Officer Goodson was justified in not putting a seatbelt on Mr. Gray because he had been \u201ccombative,\u201d Mr. Fraling said, although Judge Williams questioned whether the officer had a duty to reassess such a characterization over the course of the ride. \u201cAt no point in time did he present as being in medical distress or in need of medical treatment,\u201d Mr. Fraling said of Mr. Gray. He added that Mr. Gray was injured between the fifth and sixth stops of the ride and that medical help was immediately summoned when Mr. Gray was discovered unconscious at the sixth stop. David Jaros, an associate professor of law at the University of Baltimore, said the case had raised important questions about policing in the city. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake for people to focus entirely on whether or not there\u2019s a criminal conviction here,\u201d Professor Jaros said, \u201crather than on whether or not we have ample proof of serious problems with police in Baltimore that require that we explore: How are we going to prevent these in the future?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562293.1124122}
