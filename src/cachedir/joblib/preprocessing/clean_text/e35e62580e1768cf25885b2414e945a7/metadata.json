[The president met nine American citizens Monday who were suffering the financial effects of what he described as the \u201cvery, very, failed and failing Obamacare law. \u201d  Trump told the group that he would put into place a better plan that \u201clowers cost, expands choice, and ensures access for everyone\u201d and promised \u201cmore competition and less regulation\u201d in the market place. \u201cYou\u2019ll see rates go down, down, down, and you\u2019ll see plans go up, up, up, you\u2019ll have a lot of choices,\u201d he said. Trump admitted that it would take a few years to fully fix the insurance marketplace, but promised that it would be \u201ca thing of beauty\u201d when completed. He was critical of the media for reporting that Obamacare was doing well. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like President Obama, when he left people like him, when he was here, people didn\u2019t like him so much. That\u2019s the way life goes, that\u2019s human nature. \u201d Trump said that Republicans were in bad position politically by trying to repeal Obamacare, when it would be easier to let it collapse entirely. \u201cThe press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden,\u201d he said, predicting disastrous results for the law in 2017. Carrie Couey, a cattle rancher from Colorado explained that her rates under Obamacare were three times the rates and that multiple insurers had dropped their coverage. \u201cMillions of people had great health care that they loved,\u201d Trump said. Brittany Ivey of George said her private insurance rates went up 110 percent, and that even though she was paying $1300 a month for a plan, her doctors wouldn\u2019t take the insurance. \u201cWe\u2019re so happy to be seeing it going,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost put our family in financial ruin. \u201d Elias Seife, Florida, an attorney from Florida, said that their insurance had changed every year since Obamacare was put into place, noting that they had a daughter with a disability. \u201cI think the real scenario was that this law was supposed to implode   \u2026     my parents came from communist Cuba, they know what socialism is all about, so I know what socialism is and that\u2019s pretty much what this whole system was meant to have one single provider,\u201d Seife said. Kim Sertich from Arizona told the president that the 116 percent increases reported in her state were very real, explaining that she lost her plan three times before opting out of getting health care all together. A nurse from Wisconsin, Gina Sell, said that she was forced to take a full time job and more time away from her family after, One man, Greg Knox of Ohio, gave the president a cutout card of his face with a note that was created by his    son.
