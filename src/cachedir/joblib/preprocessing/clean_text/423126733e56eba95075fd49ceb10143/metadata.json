[\u201cAll these smart people in Washington, who have not understood politics for some time, these are the same people who said, \u2018Well, it wouldn\u2019t hurt the Democrats. The country will love it,\u2019\u201d Caddell said of conventional media wisdom about Obamacare at the time of its passage.  LISTEN: \u201cThen we had several elections, and now we\u2019re saying, \u2018Oh, of course, the Republicans are doomed,\u2019\u201d he continued, referring to predictions that as many as 20 House Republicans could be facing tougher   campaigns in 2018 because of the AHCA. \u201cNo, they\u2019re not. It depends on what they do,\u201d Caddell argued. \u201cSo far, I\u2019ll tell you as a fairly competent person, I have no idea what\u2019s in this bill. That\u2019s because, other than the talking points, the headlines thrown out by Trump administration and congressional people, I have no clue what\u2019s in it. I don\u2019t know how it answers the problems that have been raised. \u201d \u201cBut at the same time, the failure of the Republicans and the White House and the entire operation to set a narrative, made important what had to be done  \u2014   to have ceded all of that ground to their opponents on the basis of, \u2018Well, you know preconditions are going to be hurt, are going to be cut out of this, and we\u2019re going to destroy Medicaid,\u2019 whatever. To have conceded that ground is to have conceded a lot,\u201d he continued.  \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure the next election is going to be about health care, one way or the other,\u201d Caddell added. \u201cIt depends on whether or not they can get something fixed, and whether or not people perceive that Donald Trump has kept his word, or whether this is just seen as another partisan battle. So I\u2019m not so sure. \u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t see any great movement in the polls, in terms of party support for either party, since they\u2019ve been doing this for several months or raising this. I\u2019m somewhat skeptical. I think the election in 2018 is going to be on much larger grounds than merely a healthcare revolt. It may or may not work to Donald Trump\u2019s benefit  \u2014   we will yet see  \u2014   or detriment. I think that we\u2019re going to see some other things raised. But the single most important thing is the economy and what happens to it,\u201d he predicted.  \u201cLet me just add another thing: whether or not Donald Trump starts representing, in this White House, the voters who put him over the top,\u201d he said, criticizing the Trump team for \u201cfailing to show much interest or clarity\u201d in using their 2016 election victory to shape a new political majority. Caddell agreed with Boyle that House Speaker Paul Ryan was a major force pushing Trump in that conventional Republican direction. He said Ryan was the paramount example of what he calls \u201cthe Chamber of Commerce Republican Establishment party,\u201d which was \u201cslaughtered in 2016. \u201d Caddell said those establishment Republicans \u201cmanaged to spark an uprising after the victory of the Republicans in 2014 and their immediate decision in December to go into conference and sell out everything the Republican candidates had campaigned on. \u201d \u201cThis group of people has never wanted Donald Trump. They don\u2019t want Donald Trump now. The longer he keeps letting them stab him in the back, which is what\u2019s happening  \u2014   whether it\u2019s on this, it\u2019s what\u2019s happening at the FCC, on privacy rights,\u201d he warned.  \u201cAnd by the way, where is Donald Trump taking on the massive disaster of the airlines in this country?\u201d Caddell asked. \u201cNowhere! They leave so much hanging. Partly it\u2019s because I fear it\u2019s because they failed to have an organizing principle of this White House. They are then susceptible to their quote \u2018allies\u2019  \u2014   enemies!  \u2014   who want to push their agenda, an agenda that the American people have never wanted. That is a real danger. \u201d Caddell faulted the Trump administration for failing to use \u201cthe bully pulpit of the White House\u201d to influence America\u2019s political culture, with the healthcare debate serving as an acute example. With a caveat about how polling has become unreliable because much of it is conducted by universities, and university polls can no longer be conducted in a truly unbiased manner, he said he doubted the level of energetic support for the House Obamacare replacement bill exceeded 25 percent. \u201cHow did they get in that fix? And most of all, how did they do it when, in fact, the market, I think, is collapsing?\u201d he marveled. \u201cPart of the problem is there is no place for ordinary people, or even sophisticated people, to go to find out what the truth is. All we\u2019re getting is propaganda from MSNBC and CNN, the mainstream media. We don\u2019t have enough places for people to go and sort the facts, and it certainly isn\u2019t coming out of the House leadership. \u201d Boyle noted the White House could spend more time touting its successes, such as achieving the lowest unemployment figure last month in more than a decade. Caddell responded that he did not want to \u201cstart throwing around unemployment numbers\u201d he was denouncing as \u201ccooked, in the sense that they no longer reflect the real reality of what unemployment is\u201d last year. \u201cThose people who cannot get   work and whatever, that number is still higher, and we shouldn\u2019t repeat the mistake the Obama people and the Bill Mahers of the world\u201d made by overemphasizing the importance of the headline unemployment figure. \u201cThis is still not a good economy. It\u2019s getting better,\u201d he pronounced. \u201cBut it\u2019s Trump\u2019s opportunity. That, and standing up for people, and shaking Washington to its foundations. That\u2019s why I said something like the airlines. The entire reason our airline industry is so much worse than Europe is because everyone in Washington has been bought off by these people, including those pathetic congressmen I saw question witnesses last week, who complain about their own trips but do nothing about it because they get too much money. \u201d \u201cWhen he starts draining the swamp, rather than inviting the swamp to eat him, then he will begin to turn this,\u201d Caddell advised. \u201cBut I have to stay it. It\u2019s just a true statement: this White House has no strategy. They could have done   things in health care, gotten a bill passed with two things: how about dealing with drug prices, and also allowing interstate competition? Just laying a marker down would have been good. \u201d \u201cDoing the same thing on tax reform by taking away the hedge fund money, proving he\u2019s not going to be the pawn of these big billionaire rich people  \u2014   I mean, Trump needs to take charge,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey could get successes, but they won\u2019t, as long as they allow themselves to be led by their enemy allies. \u201d Boyle suggested some of President Trump\u2019s problems stemmed from the enormous permanent bureaucracy, which is prone to undermining dramatic reforms. He said there were some hopeful signs that Trump is beginning to make progress against this obstacle. \u201cI agree with you, Matt. It\u2019s not lost. It\u2019s just got to be kind of frustrating because already, things should be happening,\u201d said Caddell. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I don\u2019t mean to be just critical because they have done good things,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd they are surrounded. Remember, they\u2019re at war with an entire political class. The White House sometimes looks like Fort Apache under attack. I mean, the Indians are everywhere. \u201d \u201cWe have a national media that is literally proving itself to be the enemy of the American people, and it will not put out any news that is true or factual that will help Trump,\u201d he said, accusing the media of banding together \u201cin such negativity to undermine him. \u201d  \u201cThen you have the political class itself, which are the lobbyists, lawyers, money of both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party  \u2014   who are united because they so desperately need to go back to normal, to further their corruptions,\u201d he added. \u201cTrump needs to strike the high ground. This is the most unique challenge a president has ever had. He has got to figure the unique ways to do it. I think they\u2019re capable of it, but so far, somebody needs to tell them they\u2019re not doing it,\u201d Caddell said.
