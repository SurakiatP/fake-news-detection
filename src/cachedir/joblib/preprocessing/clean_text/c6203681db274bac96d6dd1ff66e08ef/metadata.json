The phenomenon is known as the S\u00e8vres Syndrome, harking back nearly 100 years to a treaty that was never carried out but that would have divided Anatolia, the Asian landmass that makes up the bulk of modern Turkey. The syndrome is named for the French city where Western powers, at the conclusion of World War I, signed a treaty that brought about the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Analysts have used the terms \u201cphobia,\u201d \u201ctrauma\u201d and \u201csyndrome\u201d to describe the country\u2019s   as if Turkey were a patient on a psychologist\u2019s couch. Ever since S\u00e8vres, they have said, Turkey as a nation has been suffering from   stress disorder. One way the syndrome is believed to have manifested itself is in Turkey\u2019s denial of the Armenian genocide. More recently, Turks have blamed the United States and Western allies for huge street protests, a corruption scandal and this summer\u2019s  failed military coup. The Turkish government has accused followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric in   exile in Pennsylvania, of plotting the coup. But rather than talking about how President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had allowed Mr. Gulen\u2019s supporters to gain a foothold in the nation\u2019s military, the Turkish public has been consumed with blaming the United States. \u201cThey say, well, it was the Americans who worked with Gulen to get in these positions,\u201d said Fatma Muge Gocek, a   sociologist at the University of Michigan. \u201cWhy? Because they are out to get us. \u201d She added: \u201cWhen you are constantly blaming others for what happens to you, you can never, therefore, heal. \u201d Dietrich Jung, a professor of Middle East studies at the University of Southern Denmark, said the actions of Europeans sometimes underscored suspicion about the Turks. He pointed to a recent debate in Denmark about whether that country\u2019s royal family should meet with Mr. Erdogan during a visit to Turkey, given concerns about the Turkish leader\u2019s growing authoritarianism. \u201cThey visited Saudi Arabia,\u201d Mr. Jung said. \u201cThey visited China. Nobody talked about authoritarian politics. Why Erdogan?\u201d Why indeed, many Turks would say, suspiciously.'"}, "time": 1742561889.8674412}
