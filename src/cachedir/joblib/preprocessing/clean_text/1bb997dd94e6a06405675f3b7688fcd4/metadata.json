Charles Schumer (D. . Y.) the leader of the Senate Democrats, called upon Sessions to resign because he met with the Russian ambassador in 2016 as a senator. [\u201cI rise today to speak in defense of a dear colleague of ours, who is now the Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said Sen. David Perdue (R. .) who like Sessions was a campaign surrogate for President Donald Trump.  \u201cHe is my friend, and more importantly, he is a former colleague of this very body,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of integrity. He is a man of principle. I trust him and I take him at his word,\u201d the senator said. Perdue said that Sessions has repeatedly pledged that he would recuse himself from any investigations into Russian meddling in the American political process during the 2016 election cycle. The attacks on Sessions surprised Perdue, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never witnessed anything quite like this in my brief time in the United States Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last two years have been very interesting, but never have I seen the hypocrisy that we see going on around this one issue. It is increasingly clear that the Minority Party is singularly focused on sabotaging this new administration at every turn. \u201d Perdue said it should be remembered that Senate Democrats have used every possible delaying tactic or procedure to hamper the president from building his team. \u201cOur President today, as we stand here in this well, cannot have a staff meeting because he doesn\u2019t have all of his Cabinet members in place. \u201d Without mentioning her name, Perdue pointed out that Sen. Claire McCaskill (D. .) Tweeted that she never met with the Russians, only to have her own Twitter feed contradict her. Claire McCaskill says she\u2019s had \u201cno call or meeting   ambassador. Ever. \u201d But she tweeted about two. It\u2019s easy to forget. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) March 2, 2017,  \u201cThirty members, as a matter of fact, of this body met with the Russian Ambassador and ambassadors from other nations in 2015 for a sales pitch on President Obama\u2019s deal with Iran,\u201d he said, \u201cMany of them  \u2014   including the senior senator from Missouri  \u2014   were open supporters at that time of candidates in the Presidential race,\u201d he said. Perdue said the Democrats are desperate to spin up scandals, while Republicans are working to reverse the damage done to America and the world by President Barack Obama and his policies. That does not mean that the Russians are not a concern, he said. The Russians have invaded their neighbors, threatened our friends, and destabilized regions, such as the Middle East, he said. \u201cUntil there is a definite proof that Russians changed a single vote from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump, I will be focused on one thing, and that is doing exactly what the American people sent us up here to do \u2014  and I encourage my colleagues to do the same \u2014  and that is not to engage in political theater for the sake of partisan politics, but working together to get America back to work,\u201d he said.
