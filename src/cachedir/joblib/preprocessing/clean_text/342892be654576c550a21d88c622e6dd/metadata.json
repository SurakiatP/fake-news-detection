It was Eileen Plankton\u2019s birthday and anticipation was high as she entered the office with several Marks and Spencer bags. \\n\u201cOh yeah, everyone was really impressed,\u201d said a colleague who wished to remain anonymous. \\n\u201cI mean \u2013 Markses; I thought we were in for a real treat. They do a lovely cream horn.\u201d \\nAfter several hours of playfully tormenting her colleagues with amusing comments like \u2018these bags? No, they\u2019re just lunch. I\u2019m a bit peckish today,\u2019 Mrs Plankton finally sent the following email: \\n21 again, and if you believe that you\u2019ll believe anything. Some sweet treats on Len\u2019s desk (he\u2019s off having his prolapse sorted, so he won\u2019t mind). \\nHowever, excitement turned to disappointment as the true nature of the cakes became clear. \\n\u201cWell, she might as well have just shat all over the desk,\u201d continued Mrs Plankton\u2019s colleague. \\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t Markses cakes at all, she\u2019d just reused the bags. There was a box of Poundstretcher\u2019s broken biscuits, some cheap cheese straws and six boxes of Value jam tarts. \\n\u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. This horrible silence descended as everyone saw what she\u2019d done. \\n\u201cI just ate nine jam tarts without looking at her and walked off not even bothering to say \u2018Thank you\u2019.\u201d \\nShortly afterwards the police were called, Mrs Plankton was arrested and she is expected to be sentenced to between 18-24 months for her crimes.
