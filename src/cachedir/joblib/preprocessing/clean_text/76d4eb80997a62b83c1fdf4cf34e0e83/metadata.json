Ms. Stepien, an elementary schoolteacher, said in an interview on Monday, as she was about to board a plane for her honeymoon. \u201cAnd I was just thinking, \u2018My dad is here with us, and this man is here with us because of us.\u2019 \u201d This story began in September 2006, when her father, Michael Stepien, was walking home from his job as head chef at a restaurant. Mr. Stepien, 53, was cutting through an alley when he was robbed at gunpoint by a    who shot him in the head at close range, she said. Leslie L. Brown was convicted of   murder in the killing and is serving 40 years to life in prison, according to news reports. As her father lay dying at a hospital, Ms. Stepien said, her family \u201cdecided to accept the inevitable\u201d and donated his organs through an organization called the Center for Organ Recovery and Education. The organization allows donor families and the recipients to keep in touch with one another after the transplant. Mr. Stepien\u2019s heart went to Arthur Thomas, a father of four who lives in Lawrenceville, N. J. and who Ms. Stepien said had been within days of dying. Given a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia about 16 years before receiving the transplant, Mr. Thomas, 72, said in an interview on Monday that he was in congestive heart failure when word arrived that his doctors had found a heart. \u201cIn order to get to the top of the transplant list, you have to be really hurting,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cOnce I had my transplant, I, of course, decided I would write a   to the family. \u201d From there, a relationship was forged through monthly phone calls, emails and letters. Ms. Stepien\u2019s mother, Bernice, kept in touch with Mr. Thomas, even swapping cards on Christmas and flowers on birthdays. At times, they compared parenting tips. But the families had not thought about meeting in person until Jeni Stepien, 33, became engaged to Paul Maenner, a    engineer, in October. \u201cOne of my first thoughts in that following week was, \u2018Who will walk me down the aisle?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Stepien said. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Oh, my gosh, it would be so incredible to have a physical piece of my father there.\u2019 \u201d At her fianc\u00e9\u2019s suggestion, Ms. Stepien wrote Mr. Thomas, whom the family calls Tom, asking him to walk her down the aisle. Mr. Thomas said yes, but only after running the proposition by his    daughter, Jackie, he said. \u201cShe said, \u2018I think it\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Thomas said of his daughter, who also recommended that he start practicing walking down the aisle. (He said he practiced once before the wedding.) Mr. Thomas, a retired college adviser who formerly worked at a boarding school in Lawrenceville, warned Ms. Stepien that his emotions might get the best of him. Ms. Stepien said she felt the same, and told him, \u201cI\u2019ll be right there with you. \u201d The wedding took place on Saturday in the church in Swissvale where Ms. Stepien\u2019s parents were married. Mr. Thomas and the bride formally met one day earlier, when he suggested she grip his wrist, where his pulse is strongest. \u201cI thought that would be the best way for her to feel close to her dad,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cThat\u2019s her father\u2019s heart beating. \u201d At the church, the bride was photographed touching Mr. Thomas\u2019s chest. At the reception, they danced together, and guests mingled with Mr. Thomas and his wife, Nancy. The two families say they want to keep in touch and will plan a   somewhere down the road  \u2014   maybe an event with a little less pressure. \u201cI felt wonderful about bringing her dad\u2019s heart to Pittsburgh,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cIf I had to, I would\u2019ve walked. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564118.7413194}
