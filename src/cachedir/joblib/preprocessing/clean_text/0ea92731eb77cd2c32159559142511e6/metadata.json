He had insurance, as well as a hunch: Some manner of charity care was probably in the offing. His intuition was proved correct this month when Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional Medical Center said they would not bill victims of the June 12 siege, which left 49 people and the gunman, Omar Mateen, dead. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a blessing for everybody involved,\u201d said Mr. Sumter, 27, who was working as a bartender at the gay nightclub. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve been through a lot. \u201d The hospitals said the donated aid, including emergency care and   surgery, could be worth more than $5. 5 million. The hospitals treated more than 50 people, some of whom died from their injuries. \u201cIt was incredible to see how our community came together in the wake of the senseless Pulse shooting,\u201d Daryl Tol, the president and chief executive of Florida Hospital, said in a statement. \u201cWe hope this gesture can add to the heart and good will that defines Orlando. \u201d Next month, the OneOrlando Fund, which raised at least $23 million, is scheduled to begin issuing payments to victims of the shooting, during which Mr. Mateen pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State. Those disbursements, fund officials have said, have \u201cno strings or obligations attached\u201d and are intended to \u201cserve as a gift to the victims of the Pulse tragedy. \u201d But medical bills have long been a leading concern in Orlando, where many victims suffered multiple gunshot wounds. Still, Mr. Sumter, who was also grazed by a fourth bullet, said officials had never discussed financial issues during his hospitalization. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t on my mind heavy, too heavy, because the doctors and the nurses, they were all really supportive,\u201d said Mr. Sumter, who participates in physical therapy three times a week. Hospital officials, he said, \u201cnever really told me the estimated amount\u201d associated with his medical care. Orlando Health, which operates Orlando Regional Medical Center, where Mr. Sumter was treated, said it had \u201cnot sent any hospital or medical bills directly to Pulse patients, and we don\u2019t intend to pursue reimbursement of medical costs from them. \u201d The health system said that it would seek funding from other sources, including insurers and the state\u2019s crime victim compensation program, but that its unrecovered costs could exceed $5 million. \u201cThe Pulse shooting was a horrendous tragedy for the victims, their families and our entire community,\u201d David Strong, Orlando Health\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cDuring this very trying time, many organizations, individuals and charities have reached out to Orlando Health to show their support. This is simply our way of paying that kindness forward. \u201d But Orlando Health, which runs the area\u2019s premier trauma center, acknowledged that some Pulse patients might require continuing care, a poignant reality that corresponds with mounting concerns that the flow of donations might be insufficient when perhaps tens of millions of dollars are needed for disability services and lost wages. \u201cWe can\u2019t predict the future needs of these patients, their financial situations, or what the state or federal governments may require us to do for charity policies,\u201d the hospital said. \u201cSo, while we can\u2019t assume the answer is free care forever, we will use our very generous charity and financial assistance policies to assess the best way to ensure our patients get quality care here at Orlando Health in the most fiscally responsible manner. \u201d Mr. Sumter, for one, said he was grateful for the donations by the hospitals, as well as the forthcoming money from the OneOrlando fund, which officials promised to victims soon after the attack. \u201cYou hear that often, but you don\u2019t know what exactly everything is going to happen when the smoke clears,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just good to know that not only are we receiving a nice fund, we don\u2019t have to worry about the hospital bills. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561647.7956657}
