Trump pulling even or ahead of Hillary Clinton in a series of recent national polls, the once unthinkable has become at least plausible. But if he is to be elected the 45th president, he must compete on a political map that, for now, looks forbidding. In the Republican primaries, he proved a master of nationalizing the political debate, appealing to voters across regional lines with jeremiads about immigration and crime that captivated an almost uniformly white primary electorate. At the outset of the general election, Mr. Trump has dominated the    political combat on national television and social media. In the general election, however, his fate will be determined not by his Twitter followers or a relatively homogeneous Republican electorate, but by a set of interlocking and increasingly diverse regions, home to some 90 million Americans, that hold many of the 270 electoral votes he needs to win. Republicans enter the general election at a hefty disadvantage: Since the 1992 campaign, 18 states have voted consistently for Democrats in presidential elections, giving their party a firm foundation of 242 electoral votes to build upon. And in the four regions likely to decide the presidency  \u2014   Florida, the upper Southeast, the Rust Belt and the interior West  \u2014   Mr. Trump faces daunting obstacles, according to interviews last week with elected officials, political strategists and voters. Of course, months remain before voting begins, and this political year has defied many predictions. But if Mrs. Clinton clinches the Democratic nomination as expected, she may find an electoral bulwark in these coveted   voters. MIAMI  \u2014   Had Republicans nominated Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush for president, Tom\u00e1s Regalado would have hurled himself into the task of electing their candidate. \u201cI would have been all in,\u201d Mr. Regalado, the Republican mayor of Miami, said in his office overlooking Biscayne Bay. Instead, Mr. Regalado, a former broadcast journalist, intends to sit out the presidential race. He considers Mrs. Clinton untrustworthy, but views Mr. Trump as a poisonous candidate who has aggravated racial divisions. In Miami, Mr. Regalado said, Mr. Trump is seen as \u201ca bully, as a person who despises people that don\u2019t look like him. \u201d Mr. Regalado, 69, said he had been inundated with angry email, some of it mentioning Mr. Trump by name. \u201cSometimes they say, \u2018Yeah, Trump is right, you guys have to all go back to your country,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Regalado, who was born in Havana and emigrated as a teenager. \u201cThis is my country. I can\u2019t go back to Cuba. \u201d Since Mr. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, he has consolidated support from national party leaders and from many in the rank and file. He has pulled nearly even with Mrs. Clinton in many polls, including in Florida. But the southern tip of the nation\u2019s most populous swing state has been a blazing exception to the trend  \u2014   most of all in   County, a densely populated bastion of diversity that cast about a tenth of the statewide vote in 2012. If Mr. Trump has effectively staked his campaign nationwide on strong support from whites, Florida may present the most punishing test of his strategy, as Hispanics here, including     who twice helped George W. Bush carry the state, turn away from his candidacy en masse. Mr. Trump has trampled local sensibilities in myriad ways, from his belittling treatment of Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush to his personal coarseness, slashing comments on immigration and endorsement of open relations with the Castro government. In addition to Mr. Regalado, two Republican members of Congress from Florida, Ileana   and Carlos Curbelo, have said they will not back Mr. Trump, as has Carlos A. Gimenez, the Republican mayor of   County. All four are  . Early polls show voters in the area resoundingly rejecting Mr. Trump: A Quinnipiac University poll this month found Mr. Trump about even with Mrs. Clinton statewide, but losing a band of southeastern counties, including   and Broward, by 38 percentage points. Roxana M. Leon, 63, an independent voter raised in Chile, said she wanted major change in Washington, but found Mr. Trump too objectionable to support. \u201cHe\u2019s not the right person,\u201d said Ms. Leon, who works as a secretary. \u201cI am sick and tired of the old establishment, but I will vote for Clinton. \u201d Some voters who were once intrigued by Mr. Trump now regard him with distaste. Carlos Guerrero, 55, said he had been willing to \u201clook the other way\u201d on many of Mr. Trump\u2019s speeches  \u2014   including \u201cthe way he speaks of Latin people\u201d  \u2014   because he liked Mr. Trump\u2019s overall message. But Mr. Guerrero, a Republican who described himself as a religious Catholic, said he recoiled when Mr. Trump began attacking Heidi Cruz, Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s wife. \u201cHe is not qualified to run this country,\u201d Mr. Guerrero, who is an actor, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThis country was made by people who believed in God. \u201d Should Mr. Trump get trounced in South Florida, he might be   to make up the difference elsewhere. Trump supporters believe he can improve upon Mitt Romney\u2019s performance in North Florida, in the conservative panhandle region and in the Jacksonville area. But Mr. Romney found it difficult in 2012 to overcome a catastrophic defeat in Miami. He cut into President Obama\u2019s support across most of Florida, but the president held steady in Tampa and Orlando, two other diverse cities, and expanded his margin of victory in   by about 69, 000 votes over his 2008 lead. Mr. Obama ultimately captured Florida by about 74, 000 votes. Mr. Trump has his supporters here. Norma Samour, the owner of a shopping center, said she was a habitual Republican voter and would likely back Mr. Trump despite some mixed feelings. \u201cHe will make the United States more like it was 15 years ago,\u201d said Ms. Samour, 56, who was raised in El Salvador and is of Palestinian descent. \u201cPeople all over the world used to respect the United States. \u201d Yet the falloff Mr. Trump faces has, at a minimum, severely hindered Republican efforts to win statewide. Mr. Gimenez, the   mayor, said nominating Mr. Bush or Mr. Rubio would have allowed Republicans to challenge the Democrats\u2019 dominance in South Florida. \u201cI don\u2019t think the margin of defeat in Miami itself would have been as large,\u201d Mr. Gimenez said. \u201cBecause of that, they may have been able to carry the state. \u201d ALEXANDER BURNS RALEIGH, N. C.  \u2014   North Carolina has a split political personality. Consider Debbie Holt. A staunch supporter of abortion rights, Ms. Holt, 56, who owns a barbecue restaurant in downtown Raleigh, makes clear where she stands on other fronts in the culture wars with signs in her storefront window: \u201cStop profiling Muslims,\u201d says one. Another: \u201cGo To The Bathroom Where You Feel Best. \u201d Yet Ms. Holt is also an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe don\u2019t take any stuff, just like me,\u201d she drawled in between ringing up   customers, using a more piquant word for stuff. Shannon White is as confused about her presidential preference as Ms. Holt is confident. A Mormon and Arizona transplant who usually votes for Republicans, Ms. White said she had no regard for Mrs. Clinton but doubted Mr. Trump\u2019s adherence to any principles and was uneasy about his \u201cabusive\u201d language. \u201cI\u2019m actually thinking more that I am going to go Libertarian,\u201d Ms. White, 42, said after wrestling with a mannequin at the apparel store she and her husband recently opened. For decades, this state has embodied contradictory impulses, simultaneously electing a racial   like Jesse Helms and New South Democrats like Terry Sanford and Jim Hunt. But, as its demographics shift, discerning which way the state will tilt in November seems harder than ever. North Carolina may be the most evenly divided presidential battleground in the country. Its two biggest population centers, Charlotte and the   Research Triangle of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, have been transformed by an influx of political centrists from other states. The   party registration preference is not Republican nor Democrat, but unaffiliated. The rural white \u201cJessecrats,\u201d conservative Democrats who reliably cast ballots for Mr. Helms, are dying off. Elections are now won in the   edge towns like Cary, outside Raleigh, which natives joke stands for Containment Area for Relocated Yankees. Neither Mr. Trump, with his   nationalism, nor Mrs. Clinton, with a swirl of scandal surrounding her, is a natural fit for a state that hungers for political moderation but is increasingly disenchanted with the political class. \u201cThey don\u2019t like either party and they don\u2019t like either candidate,\u201d said Carter Wrenn, a veteran Republican strategist here. \u201cIt will just depend on which one they dislike less on Election Day. \u201d Polls show Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton begin the general election close to evenly matched. The surest sign of a jump ball: Democrats believe Mr. Trump starts with a narrow advantage, while Republicans believe Mrs. Clinton does. What they agree on is that, as at the national level, Republicans are largely coalescing around Mr. Trump and ruling out the possibility that Mrs. Clinton could run away with the state. Then again, Mr. Trump needs North Carolina much more than Mrs. Clinton does. With his difficulties among Hispanic voters pushing typical swing states such as Colorado, Nevada and Florida toward the Democrats, Mr. Trump will probably need to carry the combined 28 electoral votes from North Carolina and Virginia to capture the White House. But Virginia, demographically and politically, is a step to North Carolina\u2019s left, increasing the pressure on Mr. Trump to win here. While Mr. Obama twice carried Virginia, by six percentage points in 2008 and by less than four in 2012, he won North Carolina by less than one percentage point in 2008 and then, in a more closely contested election, lost North Carolina in 2012 by about two points. Some Republicans worry that the backlash to the   bathroom bill, aimed at transgender people, that Gov. Pat McCrory signed into law in March could lead moderates to cast their ballots for Democrats in November. But Democrats fret that the deep unpopularity of both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and the   campaign to come, could depress turnout among the state\u2019s centrists and progressives. Finishing breakfast with her    daughter at a Raleigh diner, Adrian Blackwell, 37, who works in medical sales and voted for Mr. Obama twice, said she would sit out the election. \u201cI really can\u2019t in good conscience give my vote to Hillary or Trump,\u201d she said, citing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s establishment ties and Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cI feel worried for our country. \u201d Brad Crone, a Democratic strategist, acknowledged that \u201cTrump is doing better than folks think,\u201d saying that   and \u201cHillary\u2019s high negatives\u201d had created a difficult environment for her. What could tip the scales for Mr. Trump here is if he can improve his negative image, as voters\u2019 opinions of him appear less fixed than they are of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of his antics,\u201d said Rick Peele, 57, who works for an architecture firm, leans Republican and was meeting a friend for lunch in downtown Raleigh last week. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t been impressed with Hillary, either,\u201d he added quickly. Asked when he had faced such a choice for president, he shot back: \u201cNever. \u201d JONATHAN MARTIN   Pa.  \u2014   Mr. Trump\u2019s best play for the White House is to cut a swath through the Rust Belt, flipping states traditionally won by Democrats that harbor large numbers of the white   voters who have welcomed his hard line on immigration and trade. A handful of victories in the Rust Belt states stretching from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin could allow Mr. Trump to lose Florida and still become president. But all Rust Belt states are not equal: Ohio, which Mr. Obama won by just two percentage points four years ago, is the most likely Republican pickup. Michigan, which Mr. Obama won by about 10 points, is the biggest stretch. Pennsylvania  \u2014   the   battleground in 2012 after Ohio  \u2014   perennially tempts Republicans to pour in resources in hopes of expanding the electoral map. To win the Rust Belt, a region that has generally gone Democratic in six straight presidential elections, Mr. Trump will have to win here. The challenge for him in Pennsylvania is to expand his appeal to   voters without alienating   Republicans, including women repelled by his   insults and businesspeople who doubt his conservatism. \u201cI support the Republican Party, but I\u2019m not personally on the Trump train,\u201d said Melissa Wilson, a preschool teacher in Chester County, outside Philadelphia. \u201cI might not vote for president. I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s going to be able to speak to other nations and not cause us problems. \u201d If enough   Republicans like Ms. Wilson reject Mr. Trump, his Rust Belt dreams will probably be thwarted. \u201cHe has to pull away the marginal Obama voters, which tends to be lower socioeconomic whites,\u201d said Henry Olsen, an electoral analyst at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. \u201cThe question for Trump is whether his persona and issue stance will alienate classic Romney voters in the managerial class. The margin for error is very small. \u201d Two counties in eastern Pennsylvania may best illustrate the give and take: Luzerne, where   white Democrats are flocking to Mr. Trump, and Chester, the state\u2019s wealthiest. In Luzerne County, registered Democrats far outnumber Republicans, but Mr. Trump won more votes in his April primary than Mrs. Clinton did in hers. Before the vote, 4, 647 Democrats and independents in Luzerne County switched their registration to Republican  \u2014   nearly four times the number of Republicans and independents who reregistered as Democrats. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies say she would need to hold on only to Mr. Obama\u2019s coalition of young people, women and minorities to carry Pennsylvania. But Republicans say Mr. Trump is making his own new math, and some Democrats acknowledge worries. \u201cI know families who\u2019ve been lifelong Democrats who switched to Republican to vote for Trump,\u201d said Mike DeCosmo, the chairman of the Luzerne County Democratic Party. \u201cPretty much the same thing happened when Reagan ran. \u201d Mr. DeCosmo mentioned a family who owns a   business in Hazle Township, a father and four adult sons, active Democrats who left the party. \u201cAll   workers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough. \u201d In   the county seat, two members of the plumbers and pipe fitters union, Matt Hilstolsky and Jason King, pledged on their lunch break to vote for Mr. Trump, despite expecting their union to endorse Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBringing back jobs is the No. 1 thing,\u201d Mr. Hilstolsky said. Elaine Bernardo, who works in customer service for Nabisco  \u2014   the maker of Oreos that Mr. Trump often assails for moving production to Mexico  \u2014   said she was a Democrat, \u201cbut a Republican at heart,\u201d and planned to vote for Mr. Trump. \u201cThe middle class is being eradicated,\u201d she said, pointing to sinking economic fortunes in the area. \u201cPeople who have homes that were in a certain price range can expect now 50 percent of the value they could have gotten 30 years ago. They are having their houses sold at tax sales. \u201d In relying on white   voters, Mr. Trump is bucking a demographic tide: The share of those voters in the Rust Belt is on the decline, while the share of college graduates is rising, said Ruy Teixeira, an elections analyst at the liberal Center for American Progress. \u201cTrump is trying to run up historically large margins\u201d among the white working class, Mr. Teixeira said, \u201cbut there\u2019s less of them to run up. \u201d In Chester County, by contrast, it seems as though minds are still being made up about Mr. Trump. Val DiGiorgio, the county Republican chairman, said he hears from both \u201cMain Line Republicans\u201d of the Philadelphia suburbs who say they will not vote for Mr. Trump and others, including \u201ca lot of Democrats and independents,\u201d who are energized by his candidacy. \u201cThe question is whether Trump makes up enough ground with those type of voters to offset what he\u2019s going to lose,\u201d Mr. DiGiorgio said. He gave him a   chance. At a   for a state lawmaker in West Chester this month, guests in business attire expressed strong misgivings about voting for Mr. Trump. But some were already reconciling themselves to the idea. \u201cI\u2019m not enthusiastic I\u2019m afraid he isn\u2019t trustworthy,\u201d said Peg Layden, a grandmother who said she voted for Mr. Cruz in the primary. \u201cBut I will definitely vote for the nominee. \u201d TRIP GABRIEL PHOENIX  \u2014   H\u00e9ctor Salinas, 21, was born in this city but grew up in Mexico. Nancy Herrera, 31, was born in Mexico but entered the United States illegally when she was 3 and gained legal status only when she married an American citizen 10 years ago. They are   at Mi Familia Vota, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that helps Latinos become citizens and register to vote. They are barred from discussing specific candidates, but this year they have not had to. \u201cThe moment we talk about immigrant rights, immigration reform, people stop us and say, \u2018Where do I sign? I\u2019m going to vote this year because I don\u2019t want Donald Trump to be my president,\u2019\u201d Mr. Salinas said. Arizona is both a flash point in the nation\u2019s immigration battles and a microcosm of a changing United States. One in three residents is Latino, and one in four Latinos is old enough to vote. And while the white population is aging  \u2014   its median age is 43  \u2014   the median age of Latinos is 26. Already, Hispanics are a majority of public school students. \u201cThe voters of tomorrow,\u201d said Joseph Garcia, the director of the Morrison Institute Latino Public Policy Center at Arizona State University. But will Hispanics vote this year? The November election presents a unique enticement. Not only is Mr. Trump on the ballot, but so is one of his most outspoken supporters: Joe Arpaio, the swaggering Maricopa County sheriff who is seeking   and was found in contempt of court this month for defying a federal judge\u2019s order to stop profiling Latinos. \u201cThe Democrats have the best chance of winning Arizona since Bill Clinton won Arizona in 1996,\u201d said Jaime Molera, a Republican strategist and former state schools superintendent who worked for former Senator Jon Kyl, one of the most conservative voices in Congress. The 2012 election offered a good window into how ethnicity and age play out here in politics. Mr. Romney carried the state by about nine points, winning   of the white vote and 71 percent of voters 65 and above. President Obama was favored by 63 percent of voters under 30 and gathered almost   of the Latino vote. Latinos might well help turn Arizona blue. But if the left and right here agree on anything, it is that Latinos alone may not be able to do so just yet. They will need help from moderate Republicans and independents, who together form the state\u2019s most potent voting bloc. With Mrs. Clinton showing weakness on the Democratic side, peeling off those     and    voters will not be an easy job  \u2014   but it is being done by going door to door, by   groups and   Democratic candidates. All are seeking to capitalize on animus toward Mr. Trump and Mr. Arpaio, particularly among younger voters, who have grown up hearing stories about the sheriff\u2019s harsh treatment of Latinos. (Maricopa County, whose seat is Phoenix, is home to about 60 percent of Arizona\u2019s population.) Canvassers and candidates alike are highlighting the financial costs and reputational harm to Arizona brought on by Mr. Arpaio\u2019s crusades against undocumented immigrants. And they are portraying Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Arpaio\u2019s stances as indistinguishable. \u201cArpaio is the original Trump,\u201d said Stacy Pearson, the campaign manager for Paul Penzone, a former Phoenix police sergeant making his second run for sheriff as a Democrat, after nearly defeating Mr. Arpaio in 2012. \u201cTrump\u2019s      approach could have been a slogan for Arpaio\u2019s entire career. \u201d In an interview, Mr. Arpaio welcomed the association, saying the November elections would not be decided by party affiliation or ethnicity. \u201cPersonalities count more than ever this time around,\u201d he said. Republicans, he added, \u201chave nothing to worry about. \u201d But Mr. Molera, the Republican strategist, said that \u201cif Republicans say they\u2019re not concerned, they don\u2019t want to admit it or they just don\u2019t get it. \u201d An immigration law enacted in Arizona in 2010, which gave the police broad powers to stop people they suspected of being in the country illegally, spawned several civil rights groups that have recruited many young Latinos. Drawing on their own experiences  \u2014   seeing parents deported, neighbors caught in workplace raids, siblings who dropped out of college after the state required undocumented immigrants to pay    tuition  \u2014   these activists are advising immigrants of their rights and pressing those who are eligible to register to vote. Sometimes it means pressing people who are not eligible to vote. \u201cI spent 30 minutes talking to a man  \u2014   he was very angry, very disillusioned,\u201d said Mr. Salinas as he prepared to knock on doors on Phoenix\u2019s overwhelmingly Hispanic west side. \u201cHe was undocumented, but he took home three voter registration forms for his kids. \u201d In 2010, there were 91, 000 Latinos registered to cast their ballots by mail in Arizona. This month, the number has climbed above 300, 000  \u2014   and state officials say that people who vote by mail are twice as likely to cast their ballots. \u201cA lot of people are tired of all the stuff that keeps pushing them down,\u201d Mr. Salinas said. \u201cWe want to turn the light on so they can believe again. If they believe again, they\u2019ll participate. And if they participate, change comes faster. \u201d FERNANDA SANTOS'"}, "time": 1742562341.204265}
