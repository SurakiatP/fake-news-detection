These men and women are also known as the #CUB55. \\nThe maintenance workers lost their jobs after CUB terminated a machine maintenance contract with employer Quant, they were then offered their jobs back again at a 65% lower wage, after penalty rates and other entitlements. \\nE.H Pearson Cattle Company \u2018s head stockman, Ronnie Austin says although he and his mates often punch on with the unionised Betoota shearing contractors, joining the CUB Boycott was a \u201cno fucking brainer\u201d. \\n\u201cI\u2019m usually not a big supporter of the Unions, but you can\u2019t carry on the way these blokes have been\u201d \\n\u201cIt\u2019s fucking crook, mate\u201d \\nAustin says it\u2019s been hard work trying to avoid getting stuck into a few green demons at knock off after pushing cattle all day, but it\u2019s their duty as fellow workers to support the CUB 55. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough. But we are all starting to get around the lively fruit flavours of the Jacob\u2019s Creek Sauvignon Blanc\u201d \\n\u201cThe passionfruit and citrus prevail across the palate, which is pretty much enhanced by the fresh natural acidity which provides vibrancy and length on the finish\u201d \\nWith the Mount Isa New Years Eve Rodeo as the next big event pencilled in on their calendars, Austin says the Betoota boys are prepared to throw down with anyone who questions their choice of drink. \\n\u201cIf CUB haven\u2019t sorted this mess out by then, well yes of course we will still be drinking white wine on New Years Eve\u201d \\n\u201cIf anyone has problem with it then they can come and talk to me and Rocko. It won\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve had to bust heads in the Isa\u201d \\n\u201cIn fact anyone who wants to drink VB around me better have a note from their doctor because It\u2019s just bloody unaustralian\u201d \\nIt seems the CUB boycott has travelled across all cultures and state borders in Australia, with workers unions in Brisbane marching as well as hipster musicians now being forced to choose between supported the workers and drinking Melbourne Bitter ironically. \\n'"}, "time": 1742561650.5096962}
