See details below.\\nI have a contact for the @clintonemail site, his name is Bryan Pagliano and he actually now works for State, but he apparently set all of this up.\\nHuma sent several tests from her clintonemail account to Lona and myself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they were received. But there are many messages and responses not received.\\no She sent a message this morning from her state.gov account to cheftwan@mail.house.gov.\\n\u00c2\u00a7 Recipient responded, but she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the response.

The subject line was blank. Huma received at Clinton address, but Lona did not receive on her state.gov account.\\nCindy Trodden Almodovar\\nS/ES Supervisory Systems Administrator\\nS/ES-IRM POEMS Help Desk\\nU.S. Department of State\\nPhone: 202-647-8328 | Fax: 202-647-8191\\nAs a result of subsequent investigations regarding Secretary Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of a private email server, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. State Department reported the following:\\nFrom the unclassified May 2016 State Department report ESP-16-03:\\nTwo staff in S/ES-IRM reported to OIG that, in late 2010, they each discussed their concerns about Secretary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of a personal email account in separate meetings with the then-Director of S/ES-IRM. In one meeting, one staff member raised concerns that information sent and received on Secretary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account could contain Federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy Federal recordkeeping requirements. According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further. As previously noted, OIG found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal system. According to the other S/ES-IRM staff member who raised concerns about the server, the Director stated that the mission of S/ES-IRM is to support the Secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal email system again.\\nThe director referred to in OIG report is John Bentel. In 2010, he was the State Department employee who managed IT security issues for the top echelon of the department. He told FBI investigators those conversations back in 2010 never occurred. In March of 2016, Bentel refused to answer questions from Senate investigators and asserted his Fifth Amendment right 87 times during a deposition for a civil lawsuit related to Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of a private email server.\\nWhile it seems clear Ms. Almodovar knew about the @clintonemail.com server in 2010, there is no indication that the FBI, Washington Post or New York Times have interviewed her. The Washington Post clearly knew of the aforementioned section in the OIG report, but neglected to follow through on questioning.\\nSince there was no indication that either the mainstream media or the Justice Department was questioning Almodovar, Project Veritas Action sent a journalist as her about the truth of the issue. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a partial transcript from that interview:\\nPV Journalist: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m working on a story. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m interested. I want to know the truth and I want to know if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re one of the people who came, who went to John Bentel and said they were concerned about Hillary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private server.\\nAlmodovar: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know anything about that.\\nPV Journalist: You weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involved in that at all?\\nAlmodovar: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to stop this because this is like harassment.\\nPV Journalist: This will be the last time you see me. I just want to know the truth. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m interested. I want to know if the FBI has talked to you.\\nAlmodovar: No they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\\nPV Journalist: They haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at all\u00e2\u20ac\u015a\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015aPV Journalist: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure reporters and people have been coming to your door.\\nAlmodovar: No. No one has come to the door. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the first one.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even though her name stands out in the emails released by the FBI, no one from the FBI ever spoke to Aldomovar,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Project Veritas Action founder James O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keefe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one interviewed her or made any attempt to get to the bottom of what information she might have about this case that is so important to national security. It made us wonder\u2026 who else the FBI neglected to talk with.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\n\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742561989.1965702}
