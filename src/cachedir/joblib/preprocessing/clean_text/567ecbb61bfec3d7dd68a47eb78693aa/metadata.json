Its local candidate\u2019s headquarters sit defiantly in a fraying Muslim neighborhood. And last week, Marine Le Pen, the party\u2019s leader, packed thousands into a steamy meeting hall nearby for a pugnacious speech mocking \u201cthe system\u201d and vowing victory in this spring\u2019s French presidential election. \u201cThere\u2019s been a real evolution,\u201d Philippe   the retired head of a small manufacturing company, said as he handed out National Front leaflets in the market on a recent day. \u201cA few years ago, they would insult us. It\u2019s changed. \u201d It has long been accepted wisdom that Ms. Le Pen and her   party can make it through the first round of the presidential voting on April 23, when she and four other major candidates will be on the ballot, but that she will never capture the majority needed to win in a runoff in May. But a visit to this southeastern National Front stronghold suggests that Ms. Le Pen may be succeeding in broadening her appeal to the point where a victory is more plausible, even if the odds are still stacked against her. With a month to go, the signs are mixed. Many voters, particularly affluent ones, at markets here and farther up the coast betray a traditional distaste for the   party. Yet others once repelled by a party with a heritage rooted in France\u2019s darkest political traditions  \u2014     xenophobia and a penchant for the fist  \u2014   are considering it. \u201cI\u2019ve said several times I would do it, but I\u2019ve never had the courage,\u201d Christian Pignol, a vendor of plants and vegetables at the Bandol market, said about voting for the National Front. \u201cThis time may be the good one. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the fear of the unknown,\u201d he continued, as several fellow vendors nodded. \u201cPeople would like to try it, but they are afraid. But maybe it\u2019s the solution. We\u2019ve tried everything for 30, 40 years. We\u2019d like to try it, but we\u2019re also afraid. \u201d French politics are particularly volatile this election season. Traditional power centers  \u2014   the governing Socialists and the   Republicans  \u2014   are in turmoil. Ms. Le Pen\u2019s chief rival, Emmanuel Macron, is a youthful and untested politician running at the head of a new party. Those uncertainties  \u2014   and a nagging sense that mainstream parties have failed to offer solutions to France\u2019s economic anemia  \u2014   have left the National Front better positioned than at any time in its   history. But if it is to win nationally, the party must do much better than even the 49 percent support it won in this conservative Var department, home to three National Front mayors, in elections in 2015. More critically, it must turn   areas of the country in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s favor and attract new kinds of voters  \u2014   professionals and the upper and middle classes. Political analysts are skeptical. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boccaletti, the party\u2019s leader in the Var, knows exactly what needs to be done. Last week, he and his fellow National Front activists gathered for an evening planning session in La    a   port town devastated by the closing of   naval shipyards nearly 20 years ago. Mr. Boccaletti, who is running for Parliament, keeps his headquarters here. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you\u2019ve got to go to the difficult neighborhoods  \u2014   it\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Mr. Boccaletti told them, laughing slyly. \u201cOur work has got to be in the areas that have resisted us most\u201d  \u2014   meaning the coast\u2019s more affluent areas. It is not unlike the strategy that President Trump applied in the United States by campaigning in   Democratic strongholds in   Ohio. No one thought he stood a chance there. Yet he won. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got doctors, lawyers, the liberal professions with us,\u201d Mr. Boccaletti said. \u201cSince the election of Marine\u201d to the party\u2019s presidency in 2011, \u201cit\u2019s all changed. \u201d Yes and no. Since then, to broaden the party\u2019s appeal, Ms. Le Pen has worked to buff the National Front\u2019s image and distance it from its founder,   Le Pen, her disavowed   father, even kicking him out of the party in 2015. That strategy has helped make the National Front potentially palatable to some voters who had hesitated before. In the early days, four decades ago, winning 10 percent of the vote was considered a triumph for the party. This year, some polls predict Ms. Le Pen will get as much as 45 percent of the vote.   of her own edge toward the mainstream, Ms. Le Pen now buries her most incendiary proclamations. At a rally in nearby   last week, she pledged to cut taxes and \u201cdrastically\u201d reduce immigration  \u2014   well inside generic political formulations. Also last week, the party dismissed an official in the region for Holocaust denial. Still, Ms. Le Pen often emits the dog whistles easily recognized by her cheering crowds, as in a recent speech at Nantes, where she denounced in quick succession \u201cthe Rothschild bank,\u201d and the   media and telecom magnate Patrick Drahi, a   businessman with French and Israeli citizenship. Ms. Le Pen and her party still show little compunction over using tried and true National Front strategies that stoke racial fears. A wall at Mr. Boccaletti\u2019s tiny party headquarters here is adorned with a poster showing a hand tearing down a star and crescent, a symbol of Islam, with the slogan \u201cHere, We Are in France. \u201d Another poster showed a veiled Muslim woman accompanied by the words \u201cNo to Islamism. \u201d When the beaming Ms. Le Pen clambers onstage at her rallies, menacing chords give way to triumphant brassy blasts. At the more elaborate rallies, Wagnerian electric flame throwers dramatically cap her closing vows to \u201crenew the ties of national solidarity. \u201d In   it was Ms. Le Pen\u2019s thrusts against the \u201cmass immigration\u201d and its supposed link to France\u2019s mass unemployment that drew the loudest roars. \u201cThis is our country!\u201d the crowd chanted. \u201cShe\u2019s going to send home the immigrants,\u201d said Jean Simon, a grizzled construction worker from Nice, who attended. \u201cThere\u2019s way too much unemployment. \u201d Lashing the two issues together is a ploy straight from a playbook that dates to the National Front\u2019s original doctrine in 1972. It is part of legacy that continues to give a good many French people pause. Some 58 percent of them still consider the Front a \u201cdanger\u201d for democracy, according to a poll published in Le Monde this month, 11 percentage points more than in 2013. Yet there is enough uncertainty over whether Ms. Pen has sufficiently softened up traditional resistance that, for the first time, the candidate of a party still considered extremist by many has become the person to beat. The mainstream media is in near hysteria. Last week\u2019s cover headline in the Journal du Dimanche warned of the \u201cLe Pen Menace. \u201d The cover of this week\u2019s L\u2019Obs predicted in bold type: \u201cIf Le Pen is elected: The Black Scenario. \u201d In L\u2019Express it was \u201cWhy Le Pen is advancing  \u2014   again. \u201d Ms. Le Pen is in the unusual position of seeming like a winner and a loser at the same time. She is a winner because every French poll predicts she will come out on top in the first round. Four major candidates will be competing against her that day  \u2014   two on the left, one in the center and one on the right. None, alone, can beat her. But she is a loser because those same polls all say she will be defeated by a hefty margin in the second round of voting on May 7, whoever her opponent is. \u201cI don\u2019t think she will be elected president,\u201d said Jo\u00ebl Gombin of the University of Picardy Jules Verne, one of France\u2019s leading experts on the Front. \u201cBut it\u2019s not impossible any longer. \u201cAnd even if she\u2019s not elected, there\u2019s a strong possibility that French political life will be turned upside down, and the National Front will play a larger role,\u201d he added. The ambiguous status of winner and loser gives her whole campaign  \u2014   the tone of her voters, her activists, her top lieutenants and even Ms. Le Pen herself  \u2014   an uncertain feel, as if all are floating a few feet above reality. Muriel Fiol, a local doctor who was helping Mr. Boccaletti run the meeting, predicted that the \u201cglass ceiling was going to explode. \u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t want this political class any more,\u201d she said. But Mr. Boccaletti urged prudence. There was still some way to go, as attitudes of many locals showed. Even if buoyed by the feeling that Ms. Le Pen is a player for the first time, volunteers conceded that the going was \u201cdifficult,\u201d as was sometimes shown by the reception at the colorful market in this fishing port of pastel houses on the Mediterranean. Certainly, not all were convinced that Ms. Le Pen had outrun the long shadow of her party\u2019s ugly reputation. \u201cSure, I took their leaflet,\u201d Bernard Cornet, a retired teacher, said, broadly grinning. \u201cOnly so that I could throw it into the trash straight away. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564429.4881978}
