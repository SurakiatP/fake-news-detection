[Hopkins amended the tweet to read \u201ctrue solution\u201d soon after posting it on Tuesday, explaining that she had found the \u201ctypo\u201d to be \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to the victims of the attack on the Manchester Arena on Monday which killed 22 people.  But fellow Twitter users were quick to make the connection to the holocaust, labelling Hopkins a \u201cNazi\u201d. 22 dead  \u2014   number rising. Schofield. Don\u2019t you even dare. Do not be part of the problem. We need a true solution. #ManchesterArena,  \u2014   Katie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) May 23, 2017,  @KTHopkins How come you changed this from \u201cfinal solution\u201d to \u201ctrue solution\u201d? Come on, stand by those nazi words, nazi. pic. twitter.   \u2014      (@JohnSeaborn) May 23, 2017,  @JohnSeaborn I stand by my tweet. I find the typo disrespectful to the survivors in Manchester,  \u2014   Katie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) May 23, 2017,  Later the same day Hopkins was accused of inciting racial hatred after she tweeted \u201cWestern men. These are your wives. Your daughters. Your sons. Rise up. Demand action. Do not carry on as normal. Cowed. \u201d Both tweets were reported to the police for hate speech.

In March, she was ordered to pay \u00a324, 000 in damages and \u00a3107, 000 in costs to social justice activist Jack Monroe after wrongly accusing her of vandalising war memorials. Hopkins had meant to direct her tweet to New Stateman columnist Laurie Penny, who had shown indifference to a memorial to the Women of World War II being sprayed with graffiti reading \u201cFuck Tory scum\u201d. On Friday morning, LBC Radio appeared to have reached breaking point with Hopkins, announcing via Twitter that she would no longer be hosting her two hour slot, \u201ceffective immediately\u201d. LBC and Katie Hopkins have agreed that Katie will leave LBC effective immediately.  \u2014   LBC (@LBC) May 26, 2017,  The station refused to either confirm or deny that Hopkins had been sacked. A spokesman probed for further details responded: \u201cThat\u2019s all we\u2019re saying. \u201d The BBC\u2019s Amol Rajan has reported that there were \u201cmassive cheers and applause\u201d from the station\u2019s newsroom when her departure was announced.'"}, "time": 1742563537.1353192}
