Monday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox  Friends,\u201d Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller defended President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order halting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.  Miller explained there was precedent for Trump\u2019s action and that the United States is a nation with an \u201cabsolute sovereign right\u201d to determine who can come to the United States and who can\u2019t. \u201cThis is an authority that has been used repeatedly in the past,\u201d Miller said. \u201cOne of the more recent examples is President Obama suspended the Iraqi refugee program for six full months after two Iraqi refugees were implicated in an al Qaeda plot in Bowling Green, KY. There\u2019s been hundreds and hundreds of foreign nationals and   naturalized citizens who have been implicated in terrorism in the United States since  . This is a matter of national security. It\u2019s a matter of keeping the public safe. And the reality is in a world with 7 billion people, the United States has an absolute sovereign right to determine who can and cannot enter into the United States. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561665.0529099}
