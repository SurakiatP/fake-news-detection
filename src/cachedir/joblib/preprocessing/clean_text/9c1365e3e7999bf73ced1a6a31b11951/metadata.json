C. radio station WTOP has pulled its   ad off the air after receiving complaints from listeners. [The national   organization\u2019s paid urges the redirection of taxpayer funds from abortion business Planned Parenthood to other federally qualified healthcare centers that provide more comprehensive care.   The ad script is as follows: \u201cIt\u2019s a fact: Planned Parenthood is America\u2019s largest abortion business   \u2026    nearly a million abortions in the last three years. Its executives were caught on tape bragging about selling baby body parts. Under federal investigation, Planned Parenthood spent thirty million last election on political activism, not women\u2019s healthcare. It\u2019s time for Congress to act. It\u2019s time to redirect Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care to women, not abortions.  \u2014   Paid for by Susan B. Anthony List, \u201cSusan B. Anthony List has learned from Washington, D. C. radio station WTOP that it will discontinue airing our paid regarding taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood,\u201d said SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser. \u201cThis regrettable response to our radio spot on one of the lead topics in the current national debate is shameful for a First Amendment institution like WTOP. \u201d Dannenfelser added: One of the surest signs that a policy message like ours is effective is its opponents\u2019 pushing to silence it. Planned Parenthood speaks boldly of its pride in performing more abortions than any other entity in the United States and packaging the body parts of these aborted children for profitable use. These are the facts, however uncomfortable they may be for some to hear. Rest assured that SBA List will continue to unveil and champion the truth about Planned Parenthood, no matter what they and their allies do to suppress the reality behind their public masks. SBA List is launching a $500, 000 campaign to expose Planned Parenthood as a   abortion business to which women\u2019s actual health and safety is far from a priority. Planned Parenthood receives more than a half billion taxpayer dollars per year and performs more than 323, 000 abortions per year as well. The radio and digital advertising campaign, which targets Washington, D. C. and key states, takes off as Congress moves closer to eliminating the taxpayer funding of the nation\u2019s largest abortion chain. The Senate has passed a budget resolution bill, the first step in the process to repeal Obamacare and redirect Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer funding using the budget reconciliation procedure. Dannenfelser and her organization are urging the House to follow up by passing the Senate\u2019s budget resolution. She points out that federally qualified healthcare centers in communities \u201cprovide comprehensive health care for women and families. \u201d \u201cThese centers outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities by a 20:1 ratio,\u201d she continues. \u201cRedirecting the abortion giant\u2019s taxpayer funding will fulfill a major   commitment made by   Trump to end Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer funding as long as they continue to perform abortions. \u201d A recent poll released by SBA List found \u201ca majority or plurality of voters in 2018 Senate battleground states oppose giving tax dollars to Planned Parenthood. \u201d \u201cA majority in North Dakota, Montana, Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Florida also said they would be less likely to vote for Senators who support sending tax dollars to the abortion giant rather than community health centers,\u201d the group states. WTOP did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Breitbart News.'"}, "time": 1742628414.4747093}
