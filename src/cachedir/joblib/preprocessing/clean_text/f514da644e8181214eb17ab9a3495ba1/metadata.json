A same day article discussed The Times\u2019 latest anti-Trump broadside. WaPo featured two editorials hammering him, following so many others earlier, disgracefully accusing him of everything imaginable, while practically elevating Hillary to sainthood by comparison. \u201cWill Republicans respect democracy,\u201d WaPo editors asked? How can anyone knowledgeable about how America is run respect what\u2019s nonexistent, not earlier or now? \u201cThe big question after Tuesday\u2019s election\u2026will be whether the nation\u2019s leaders act to preserve our republic \u2013 or hasten a descent toward a banana republic,\u201d said WaPo editors. They failed to explain US governance resembles the way a crime family operates \u2013 a godfather (or godmother) atop the hierarchy, serving privileged interests exclusively. .. The \u201cfirst priority (for the nation\u2019s leadership) must be preserving and restoring the country\u2019s democratic institutions\u2026\u201d WaPo editors claimed. How can it when none exist? America is a rogue state, run by its lunatic fringe, neocon extremists, waging endless wars of aggression, punishing ordinary people with neoliberal harshness, enforcing police state viciousness on resisters, a hair\u2019s breadth from instituting full-blown tyranny \u2013 likely coming with Hillary in charge. .. WaPo editors are terrified about how multiple investigations of her wrongdoing might turn out \u2013 heading toward possibly indicting and impeaching her, ludicrously claiming: .. \u201cThere is no substantiated charge against Ms. Clinton that would warrant impeachment, or even talk of impeachment. Despite suggestions otherwise, there is also no imminent indictment against the Democratic nominee, or any available evidence suggesting that indictment is a realistic possibility\u2026 Instead, what the nation has seen over the closing days of this campaign is a party preparing to (mis)use extraordinary congressional powers for despicable political ends.\u201d \\nFact: Volumes of evidence show Hillary guilty of war crimes, orchestrating coups, other international and constitutional law violations, racketeering, perjury, obstruction of justice, fraud, influence-selling pay-for-play, and jeopardizing national security by using her private server for classified State Department documents \u2013 enough to lock anyone up for life. \\nSeparately, WaPo editors said \u201cTrump\u2019s election would be a major threat to the economy\u201d \u2013 a way over-the-top unjustifiable claim, saying: .. His \u201celection would be a major new source of instability here and abroad\u2026Suddenly, a man with a deep-seated hostility to, and incomprehension of, markets would be at the helm of the world\u2019s preeminent market economy.\u201d A billionaire business tycoon with no comprehension of markets? No one could become super-rich without a keen understanding of how they work \u2013 so what irks WaPo editors? .. They support jobs-killing trade deals like NAFTA and TPP. Trump\u2019s justifiable opposition riles them. They\u2019re angry because he\u2019s right accusing the (Wall-Street controlled) Fed of keeping interest rates near zero for political reasons, along with government agencies fudging economic data like GDP, monthly jobs numbers and inflation, among others \u2013 to make economic conditions look rosier than reality. .. Trump \u201cfailed to level with the public about the challenges before us, to provide a plausible sense of how he would improve things \u2013 or to demonstrate much of anything except the risks of entrusting him with management of an $18 trillion economy,\u201d WaPo editors claimed. Agree or disagree with him, he presented a clearer agenda than Hillary \u2013 time and again proving she\u2019s a serial liar, dishonest, untrustworthy, ruthless and dangerous.
