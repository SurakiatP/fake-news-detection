We respect your privacy and take protecting it seriously x \\nBy Brianna Acuesta This island costs less than most celebrity homes. \\nA Scottish island by the name of Tanera Mor is for sale, as its permanent residents recently moved out and put the island, along with its cafe, post office, schoolhouse, and 9 homes, on the market. \\nThe island boasts stunning views, traditional houses that have been recently restored, and self-sufficiency that is unmatched on other islands. \\nThe 760-acre isle is powered by wind turbines and generators and has a freshwater treatment plant. It\u2019s part of a group of other islands called the Summer Isles and has an established tourism business that brings in a bit of revenue. \\nThis particular island is the biggest in the isles and is located just 1.5 miles away from the Scottish coast. \\nThe scenery itself is reason enough to buy this island, or any of the three lots that are being offered separately. It\u2019s got 7 miles of cliffs, coves, and beaches to meander and relax on and you can walk across the whole island easily because it\u2019s only 1.6 miles long. \\nOver 164,000 native trees were recently planted to combat severe winds, giving the island a more natural feel. Despite the winds, the surrounding waters are said to be ideal for aquatic hobbies such as sailing, fishing, and diving; there\u2019s even a historic pier to utilize for some of these activities. Also listed on the website for this property is that it\u2019s common to look out and see porpoises, dolphins, basking sharks, and otters close by. \\nIncluded in the sale are four neighboring small islands that are completely uninhabited but contain tidal pools and other treasures. Considering a nice apartment in a big city like Manhattan costs just as much and has considerably less space, this deal may seem like a steal. While you might be giving up that city vibe, you\u2019d be replacing it with amazing views and a relaxing life. \\nWould you consider buying this island?
