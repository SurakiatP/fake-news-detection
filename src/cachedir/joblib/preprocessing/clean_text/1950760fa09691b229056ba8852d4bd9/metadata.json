Let\u2019s turn it over to Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief, for today\u2019s introduction. More than four decades ago California passed a landmark law protecting the state\u2019s farmworkers from abuse and helping them to organize. But the recent resignation of the head of a board that oversees the implementation of the law highlights the extent to which organized labor among farmworkers has collapsed since the days of the pioneering labor leader Cesar Chavez. Chavez\u2019s activism was instrumental in the creation of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975, the passage of which Gov. Jerry Brown described as a major accomplishment of his first stint as governor. In his recent resignation letter, the head of the board, William B. Gould IV, described the law as \u201cirrelevant to farmworkers. \u201d He estimated that less than one percent of the agricultural work force is now represented by a union. As chairman of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, Mr. Gould was charged with overseeing the certification process of union elections. Yet Mr. Gould said virtually no workers came to the board during his tenure. \u201cDuring the entire three years that I was chairman of the board there was only one petition for representation filed by a union in the state of California,\u201d he said. Mr. Gould says a major factor for the decline of organized farm labor is the fear that undocumented workers have of dealing with the government. Around half of the Californian agricultural work force is in the country illegally. \u201cThere is not only no incentive to complain but there is no incentive to become involved with government in any way,\u201d Mr. Gould said. California\u2019s agricultural industry is bigger than ever. It produces roughly a third of all fruits and vegetables grown in the United States and has about a third of the nation\u2019s farmworkers. Philip Martin, a specialist on organized farm labor, paints a less stark picture than Mr. Gould of the plight of farmworkers. Farmworker wages \u201chave gone up significantly,\u201d Mr. Martin said, and some workers have the benefit of voluntary agreements that growers sometimes enter with their suppliers. The average hourly wage of farmworkers in California is around $12, he said, above the state\u2019s current minimum wage of $10. Mr. Martin, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Davis, says estimates on unionization rates among farmworkers in California are not very reliable because there are no government requirements to report them. But he says it is undeniable that unionization rates have plummeted from the heyday of union power in the late 1970s. \u201cThere\u2019s not near the union activity that there used to be,\u201d he said. Student groups at U. C. Berkeley had vowed to disrupt the scheduled appearance of a controversial,   speaker. And on Wednesday, as the speaker, Milo Yiannopoulos, an editor at Breitbart News, was set to appear, protesters delivered on the promise, setting fires and throwing objects at buildings. The police canceled the event before it could begin, and buildings on the campus were locked down for several hours. Mr. Yiannopoulos condemned the outcome. \u201cOne thing we do know for sure,\u201d he said on Facebook, \u201cthe Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down. \u201d On Thursday morning President Trump responded on Twitter, appearing to defend Mr. Yiannopoulos and threaten the university\u2019s funding: (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) \u2022 What a diverse California says about the future of political strife in the rest of the United States.
