How can he say Trumps priorites are off? He has out performed his opponent in the past month in regards to his campaigning for the WH hands down! The only reason so many people are quick to judge Trump and call him a failure is because so many criminals ( career politicians and their partners in crime) have so much to loose. I would imagine that some are even considering leaving the country to avoid prosecution once Trump is elected as POTUS. Afterthought.... This pitstop in DC for the opening dedication of this new Hotel can actually be seen as part of his campaigning as it shows people that he is able to accomplish what others have failed to do, under budget and ahead of schedule. You never hear about Hillary taking tons of time off the campaign trail or her lack of press conferences and interviews with the media or her lack of on the road campaign rallies. Trump takes a brief stop in DC and Schmidt claims the walls are falling in on Trunp... really???'"}, "time": 1742561810.051286}
