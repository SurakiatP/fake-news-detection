Print Dr. Eric Walsh (Photo: First Liberty) \\nThe state of Georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the Department of Public Health after it investigated what he said in his church. \\nBut Dr. Eric Walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. \\nThe state\u2019s demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by Walsh against the Department of Health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. \\nHe\u2019s getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by Houston officials for copies of his sermons. \\nWalsh\u2019s ordeal began in May 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. Only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a Seventh-day Adventist Church. \\nLee Rudd, the agency\u2019s human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the YouTube recordings immediately. Two days later, Walsh was fired. \\nAt that point, lawyers with First Liberty Institute joined forces with the Atlanta legal team of Parks, Chesin & Walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. \\n\u201cPolice State USA: How Orwell\u2019s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality\u201d chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today! \\nNow, in response to Walsh\u2019s lawsuit, the state delivered a \u201cRequest for Production of Documents\u201d that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, \u201ccopies of his sermon notes and transcripts.\u201d \\n\u201cThis is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church,\u201d said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel for First Liberty. \\n\u201cNo government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons,\u201d said Walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. \u201cI cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so.\u201d \\nOfficials with the Georgia Department of Health declined to respond to a WND request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. \\nWalsh\u2019s lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. \\nOn the guest list was Pastor Dave Welch of Houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. \\nWND broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when Rush Limbaugh described Parker\u2019s actions as possibly \u201cone of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the Constitution that I have seen.\u201d \\nThe mayor at the time, Annise Parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . \\nIn a prepared statement Wednesday on Walsh\u2019s case, Welch said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but Georgia\u2019s demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from \u2026 us.\u201d \\nWelch, the executive director of the Texas Pastor Council, said what is happening to Walsh is \u201cworse than what happened in Houston for multiple reasons.\u201d \\n\u201cFirst, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the state is demanding much more material: sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastor\u2019s preaching Bible. It\u2019s almost as if they are ransacking the pastor\u2019s study. This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in America.\u201d \\nLeaders of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, part of the nation\u2019s largest public policy women\u2019s group with 500,000 members, also came to Walsh\u2019s defense. \\nPenny Nance, CEO, said: \u201cThe words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that, \u2018Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,\u2019 still reverberate today \u2013 especially as we witness the \u2018Gestapo-like\u2019 tactics of his native state. The state of Georgia\u2019s blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, Dr. Eric Walsh, is indeed a threat to every American, whatever our religious beliefs. \\n\u201cCan there be a clearer violation of our First Amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share?\u201d \\nWND reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed Walsh\u2019s sermons and then fired him. \\n\u201cNo one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon,\u201d Dys told Fox News when the case was filed. \u201cHe was fired for something he said in a sermon. If the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything.\u201d The original state investigation of Walsh\u2019s sermons apparently was sparked by \u201cone complaint\u201d from an official with a county Democratic Party and \u201cgay activist.\u201d \\nState officials also joked about informing Walsh of his firing. \\nThe telephone call was between Dr. Patrick O\u2019Neal, an agency official, and Kate Pfirman, an agency financial officer. The call was captured on an answering machine, which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up. \\nPfirman said: \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna be very \u2013 I\u2019m gonna try to come off as very cold, because I don\u2019t want to say very much. If I try to make it warm \u2013 I\u2019ve thought that through, it\u2019s gonna just not \u2013 there\u2019s no warm way to say it anyway.\u201d \\nThen there was laughter from both parties. \\nO\u2019Neal then said to inform Walsh, \u201cYou\u2019re out,\u201d and there was another round of laughter. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s very funny,\u201d Pfirman said. \\nThe voicemail: \\nIn the Houston dispute, voters ultimately soundly rejected Parker\u2019s ordinance giving \u201cgays\u201d and transgendered people special rights.\""}, "time": 1742561935.3049679}
