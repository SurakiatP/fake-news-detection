(Photo by AFP) \\nMoscow says Russian and Syrian aircraft have not carried out any sorties over Aleppo for nine days in line with their \u201chumanitarian pause.\u201d \\nThe Russian Defense Ministry responded on Thursday a day after a monitoring group sympathetic to militants claimed that airstrikes had killed at least 26 people in a village in Idlib. \\nRussia\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin challenged the UN and the West to provide evidence of continuing airstrikes in Aleppo. \\nChurkin said no aircraft has approached the city at a distance of less than 10 km since a unilateral moratorium was announced by Russia and Syria on October 18 \u201cin response to the UN call, and as a goodwill gesture.\u201d \\n\u201cIf you have any information that there were any missile and bomb strikes, please provide this information,\u201d Churkin said, adding he expected an \u201cobjective analysis\u201d of the current situation. \\nChurkin also criticized the UN for failing \u201cto thrash out in a proper way the operation on evacuation of the sick and injured people.\u201d \\n\u201cThe UN staff members have failed to exert required pressure on patrons of the illegal armed units so that the militants could cooperate with humanitarian workers.\u201d \\nThe Russian ambassador also hit out at UN aid envoy Stephen O\u2019Brien for bias and arrogance after claiming that Aleppo had become a \u201ckill zone\u201d under Russian and Syrian bombs. \\nThe US, Britain and France rushed to his defense in one of the stormiest council sessions in weeks after Churkin accused O\u2019Brien of failing to recognize that Russia and Syria had declared a humanitarian pause. \\nChurkin criticized the UN official for failing to present the facts objectively while foreign-backed rebels and al-Qaeda-linked terrorists are hampering a UN plan to evacuate the wounded from Aleppo. \\n\u201cPlease leave this kind of report to a novel that you might write one day,\u201d the Russian ambassador told the UN official. \\nIn Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry said Takfiri militants continue to indiscriminately target residential neighborhoods of Aleppo, using makeshift rocket launchers, and preventing civilians from leaving the city\u2019s militant-held east. \\n\u201cAircraft of the Russian aerospace forces and the Syrian air force have not been carrying out any flight closer than the 10-kilometer zone around the city of Aleppo for nine days,\u201d ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.

(Photo by AFP) \\nWarships won\u2019t join Aleppo campaign \\nThe Foreign Ministry also dismissed as absurd suggestions from NATO that a new Russian battle group heading to the Mediterranean would join the campaign against terrorists in Aleppo. \\nThe rebuttal came after NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned on Tuesday that the ships could be used to launch more airstrikes. \\nAndrei Kelin, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, told the RIA news agency that Stoltenberg\u2019s statement was unhelpful. \\n\u201cThe concerns are not based on anything as our planes have not come near Aleppo for nine days. Our battle group is in the Mediterranean. Our ships have always had a presence there,\u201d said Kelin. \\n\u2018Double standards\u2019 \\nMeanwhile, Syria\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations Bashar al-Ja\u2019afari denounced double standards towards the ongoing conflict in his country. \\nJa\u2019afari lashed out at the US for supporting the so-called moderate militants in eastern Aleppo. He said Takfiri terrorists are now in possession of US-built rockets. Syria\u2019s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Bashar al-Ja\u2019afari \\nHe also slammed Turkey\u2019s aggressive policies toward Syria amid US support, saying it violated the basics of international law. \\nJa\u2019afari said Saudi Arabia \u2013 another key ally of the West \u2013 is supporting terrorism while Wahhabi muftis are fanning the flames of bloodshed in Syria, Iraq and Yemen through their decrees. \\nThe entire Syrian population, he said, is suffering from the militancy being sponsored by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and Israel. \\nJa\u2019afari called on all members of the UN Security Council to exercise their responsibilities concerning the establishment of security and peace across the globe. \\n\u2018No Russian, Syrian role in fatal Idlib raids\u2019 \\nIn another development on Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, rejected as \u201ca lie\u201d claims that Russian and Syrian warplanes had conducted fatal air raids in the northwestern province of Idlib. \\nShe was reacting to reports that 22 children and six teachers were killed in airstrikes that hit a school and nearby areas in Idlib. \\nThe so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group linked to foreign-backed militants in Syria, later claimed \u201cwarplanes \u2014 either Russian or Syrian \u2014 carried out six strikes\u201d in the Idlib village of Hass, where the school is located. \\nZakharova further stressed \u201cthe Russian Federation has nothing to do with this terrible tragedy, with this attack,\u201d adding that Moscow has called for an immediate investigation into the incident. \\nCommenting on the reports on Idlib airstrikes earlier in the day, Russia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said \u201cit\u2019s horrible, horrible. I hope we were not involved.\u201d \\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for me to say \u2018no\u2019 but I\u2019m a responsible person. I need to see what our Defense Ministry is going to say,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742564410.2974584}
