While this has many advantages, both to the creator and to their audience, it also poses some serious problems. On the one hand, people get a voice \u2014 the ability to say and share what they want. On the other hand, people can say and share whatever they want \u2014 and other people believe it to be truth.\\nI\u2019ve been running a conscious alternative news platform for over seven years now. In the course of that time, I\u2019ve seen some truly amazing things, and some troubling things, too. But now, more than ever, I believe it\u2019s important for people to recognize the problem with some alternative news websites and to understand what really goes on. They are harming the face of independent news and I feel it needs to stop.\\nWhy Alternative News Is Necessary It\u2019s not hard to understand why alternative news exists at this point. With the majority of the mainstream media being owned by just five corporations , diverse viewpoints and interpretations of world events have become scarce. And when you understand that most outlets are serving some sort of corporate or political agenda, you start to notice how those biases play out in the representation of certain stories, and even in how frequently they\u2019re covered. Showing certain stories over others, and showing them repeatedly, goes a long way toward shaping public opinion.\\nMany are unaware of how often important stories are blacked out completely by all of mainstream media. The major pipeline spill that occurred during the Standing Rock protests or the revelation that the Pentagon paid a PR firm to create fake terrorist videos are just two recent examples. Are these not things the people should know about? Why aren\u2019t they being reported on?\\nThis leads us to wonder if there is in fact an agenda to hide this information. And how might that work? Sharyl Atkisson, a former CBS investigative journalist, explained that \u201castroturf,\u201d or fake grassroots movements, funded by political, corporate, or other special interests, are very effectively manipulating and distorting mainstream media messages.\\nFurther, here is a document declassified by the CIA that outlines their involvement in manipulating media, journalists, authors, films, and more to have \u201creporters postpone, change, hold, or even scrap stories that could have adversely affected national security interests or jeopardized sources and methods.\u201d The \u2018national security\u2019 play has always been a way for these agencies to justify shady actions.\\n\\nGiven the shady dealings, agency manipulation, and ownership structure of most of mainstream media, the need for alternative voices is clear. But how should we view those alternative voices? Do we take their work at face value?\\nThe Problems With Alternative News Websites I have seen a lot in the past seven years and I have seen a movement that is very important lose a lot of credibility \u2014 for GOOD reason. It\u2019s easy to dismiss alternative news websites because so many of them so carelessly carry out their work. There are good ones out there, but they are vastly outnumbered by the bad.\\nI decided to write this because, as someone working within this movement and who cares a lot about creating a better world, I want people to know the truth so they can make informed decisions. As much as I respect many people for what they do, there is an inherent danger in not raising awareness about this. If we expose mainstream media, we should expose alternative media too; it\u2019s only fair. I hope this encourages many of these outlets to do better work.\\nGiven the ease of creating alternative news websites these days, and the ease of making advertising revenue, it\u2019s easy to see why much of the content that gets posted is questionable.\\nUsually Run by One or Two People \\nMany alternative news or health websites are run by just one or two people. While this isn\u2019t bad when it\u2019s a passionate person who\u2019s doing work the right way, it can become a problem when that person is simply doing it for a business. They are driven to make money by exploiting a niche market, not a desire to create change, and so they make low quality websites and content so ads can be placed on the website. As you might imagine, it begins to create some or even all of the following issues that I believe do more harm than good to the movement.\\nToo Driven by Ad Revenue \\nMany of the outlets I\u2019ve worked with firsthand are highly driven by ad dollars. While it would be naive to suggest anyone should run a business without making money, since we need money to survive on this planet and simply hosting a website requires it, a desire to do good needs to remain the bottom line. Many outlets will post just about anything to make ad revenue. They will even go so far as to venture completely outside of their initial intention simply to keep up with making funds. I\u2019ve had people ask us to post something on our page for even just 10 or 15 minutes, even after I told them it was a fake or false story. Even when you let them know that a story or health tip is false, they will post it anyway to get as many hits as they can before people figure it out \u2014 if they do. And this leads to the next problem.\\nCopying Content \\nSince it is typically only one or two people running each of these huge websites and Facebook pages, they can\u2019t possibly write original content each day. And so, the majority of the time, they simply copy and paste the most viral and trendy stories onto their own website. No adding their own thoughts, opinions, insight, etc. \u2014 just taking content and adding a little link at the bottom back to the original creators. Now some have legitimate syndicated content partnerships, but this is rare. What typically happens is websites will copy and paste the most viral content each day or simply change the first few lines so the content looks fresh. This entire process takes away from the few websites that do write original content and pay a lot of money to do so.\\nTaking other website\u2019s content.\\nThe next time you read an article from an alternative news website, have a look at where the content originally came from. Check to see how many times that thread goes back from website to website to website. Often the content originates from six or seven sites back. Certainly at CE we see our original content posted on other websites all the time, sourced back to another site that took it from us (and another site, and another site).\\nRisk for False Claims and Poor Fact Checking \\nFalse Information being spread\\nSince many of these websites are run by one person, they take their content from other websites. And since their primary objective is to make as much ad revenue as possible, they often look for the most trendy or viral topic and repost without ever checking to see if the story is true. Health research, political scandals, lifestyle suggestions, and more \u2014 these topics often contain false information and there is no research behind it! People then spread this \u2018exciting\u2019 information, and since things can go viral quite easily, false information about real issues travels all over the web, all in the name of carelessness and profit. The very things they expose the mainstream for doing, they are doing themselves.\\nCheck the article for sources , legitimate ones. Are there any? Do they link to credible information? Oftentimes you will find they don\u2019t.\\nWhy It Has to Change People are starting to realize en mass that the mainstream media has its own agendas, and rarely, if ever, do they align with our well-being. They are starting to move away from this sponsored, biased content and looking for other sources. The question becomes, what will they find instead? The bevy of alternative news websites that aren\u2019t being run ethically or with integrity? Alternative sites that kill the credibility of the entire movement because of the way they title, image, and spread content that is false?\\nAs a media organization that spends a lot of time doing what we do, hiring the necessary people to make sure work is done right and articles researched properly, we have to stand up and fight against laziness and greed, and we have to fight for the truth. It\u2019s only fair. How could we possibly justify holding mainstream media accountable but letting alternative media slide?\\nSo now you know. You know what to look out for and what to do. My advice is, stop supporting and sharing content that isn\u2019t sourced or well researched. Sharing it only further denigrates this movement and supports these bad habits.\\nIf you recognize how good alternative websites operate compared to the not so good ones, awesome! You are aware and on the ball. Support those sites!
