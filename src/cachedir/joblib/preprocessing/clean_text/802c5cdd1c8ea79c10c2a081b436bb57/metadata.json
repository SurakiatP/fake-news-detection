This is a story about a small and bizarre subset of those objects, evidence left by criminals feeding that most basic of human appetites. Literally feeding. Criminals who eat in the act. \u201cPartially eaten apple,\u201d a spokeswoman for the medical examiner\u2019s office wrote when asked for examples. \u201cSunflower seed shells.   chocolate cake. Chewed gum. \u201d When she got to \u201c  biscuit,\u201d the list was not yet half over. \u201cChicken bones. Chicken wing. Pizza crust. Fruit pit. \u201d For the victim of a home burglary, it would seem to be yet another affront after the crime: the violation of the kitchen and the discovery, while perhaps seeking simple comfort in the stress, of a lowly pit where once there was fruit. That violation was last seen in this space earlier this month, in the tale of a Brooklyn man whose attempt to rent his apartment to a stranger went terribly awry. But the phenomenon of the hungry burglar is timeless. An article in The New York Times on May 17, 1886, described the theft of nearly 100 pieces of flatware from the Poughkeepsie mansion of a fallen general\u2019s widow. \u201cAfter completing their pillage,\u201d the story noted, the burglars \u201cwent down to the kitchen and brought upstairs to the parlor cooked meats, bread, cake, eggs and milk, and partook of the banquet there and then. \u201d The peculiar act of eating at the scene of the crime occurs often enough to warrant mention in police textbooks like \u201cCriminal Investigation: A Method for Reconstructing the Past. \u201d A burglar may take food from the kitchen, the authors, James W. Osterburg and Richard H. Ward, write, \u201cor display other forms of aberrational behavior that help establish a modus operandi. \u201d It is far from uncommon in New York City. \u201cHappens all the time,\u201d Detective Anthony Barbee in Brooklyn told me a few years ago. \u201cOne of the questions we always ask people, \u2018Look in your refrigerator. Is there anything open?\u2019 Maybe they\u2019re neat freaks and they notice something moved around. They look at you like you\u2019re crazy. \u201d The act defies criminal logic. \u201cI would assume, you\u2019re a burglar, you have an adrenaline rush, you want to get in and out,\u201d Detective Barbee said. \u201cBut some people make themselves at home. They get comfortable. \u201d Others take their refreshments to go. Last year, a tenant in an apartment in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan came home to discover that someone had stolen a credit card, a laptop, sunglasses  \u2014   and a bottle of alcohol. A man in Queens answered a knock at his door last August, let in two women who were pretending to need a bathroom and even offered one of them a slice of cake. After they left, he realized he had been robbed. Officers quickly found the women, who had cash from the man\u2019s home, among other things. \u201cIn stopping the vehicle,\u201d prosecutors later said, \u201cpolice allegedly recovered cake. \u201d In 2011, a woman in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, came home to find a large hole in her window screen, and her electronics and watches missing. There was a note: \u201cThanks for the O. J.,\u201d it read in part. \u201cHave a nice day. \u201d Steve Panagopoulos, a retired Brooklyn detective, said he associated food theft with addiction: \u201cThese guys are   junkies. \u201d \u201cThink about it,\u201d he said last week. \u201cThey don\u2019t really even care about getting caught. Taking their time, sitting there opening refrigerators, that\u2019s pretty crazy. \u201d That sort of behavior was the undoing of one serial thief he remembered. \u201cHe had taken out a thing of cheese, crackers,\u201d Mr. Panagopoulos said. \u201cHe left them behind on the table. That was processed for DNA. \u201d A former detective in Chinatown once shared the story of an epic intrusion visited upon the apartment of a woman who had left for a week to care for her mother. \u201cThey came in and used the pots and stove and cooked,\u201d the former detective, Jose Santiago, said. \u201cThey hung out, smoked a couple joints, ate. \u201d Soon they had company. \u201cWord got out in the building,\u201d the detective said. \u201cOne person would go in and take a TV. Literally couches, everything. She was cleaned out. \u201d Cleaned out, but no one cleaned up: \u201cThere was food in the pots when she got home,\u201d he said. Perhaps the pots were sent to the laboratory of the medical examiner. There, they would have found company in the other evidence left by criminals who eat at the scene. \u201cCandy wrappers, lollipop,\u201d the spokeswoman\u2019s list read, finally ending with a New York City flourish. \u201cAnd, of course, a bagel. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564613.1766462}
