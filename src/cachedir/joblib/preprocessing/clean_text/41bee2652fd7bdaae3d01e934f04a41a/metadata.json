Gang members stood in front of the machines at the appointed hour and collected millions of dollars. \\nEarlier this month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned U.S. banks of the potential for similar attacks.\\nThe FBI said in a bulletin that it is \u201cmonitoring emerging reports indicating that well-resourced and organized malicious cyber actors have intentions to target the U.S. financial sector.\u201d \\nThe FBI bulletin cited software used by a Russian gang known as Buhtrap. Sometimes the hackers break into the systems that process transactions on banking payment networks; other times they have hit ATM networks directly.\\n[\u2026]\\n\u201cThese guys, who could have been in the past just going after consumers\u2026are breaking into financial institutions,\u201d said Eric Chien, technical director of Symantec Corp.\u2019s Security Technology and Response division.\\nThe computer code to carry out the attacks was released earlier this year by a disgruntled Buhtrap member\u2026 \\nIt seems that ample evidence exists that the powers that be shouldn\u2019t be wrapping everything up in the grid, and yet they are.\\nWhile they kinds of events reinforce the reasons that we shouldn\u2019t invest everything in the banks, or trust the system to be there when we need it, but rather to hedge into cash, commodities, barter and as much self-reliance as one could muster.\\nThis is the clearest reason yet in the news cycle as to why you shouldn\u2019t be keeping your money at the bank \u2013 certainly not more than you could bear to lost in a crisis.\\nWith every new crisis, the system will position for more control, selling cyber security, enhancing biometrics and security questions, but the same fatal flaws remain: too much centralized power over everyone\u2019s finances\u2026 and too easy for people to take advantage of it all in one place.\\nGovernments can\u2019t be trusted with all that power and data, and neither should the banks \u2013 if only because bad people can then get what they want.\\nWe\u2019re walking on eggshells of a fragile system\u2026 and its illusion of strength is one of its most dangerous appeals, false security.\\nRead more: \\nThe Lock Down Has Begun: JP Morgan Restricts ATM Cash Withdrawals \\nIntelligence Insider: How To Protect Your Assets From Critical Infrastructure Failure: \u201cPower Grid, Banking System, Cyber Financial Warfare\u201d \\nThis is Why You Need Your Money Out of the Bank: Freeze Outs, Glitches and Holds Increasingly Locking Customers Out of Funds \\nHow to Hide Your Money Where the Bankers Won\u2019t Find It \\nWhat Guns?
