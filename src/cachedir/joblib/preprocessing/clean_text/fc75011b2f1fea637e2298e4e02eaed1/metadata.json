The drivers had started from their offices on outer ring road and had to take a u-turn to reach their homes on the other side of the road but the Bangalore Traffic police made some unexpected changes due to which the car drivers kept on driving, finally finding a u-turn near Mysore. \\n\u201cU-turns and one ways! At one point, I even asked a few passersby to help me lift the car and place it on the other side of the road. But some of them rushed and sat inside my car as they had been waiting to cross the road for the last 6 days and finally saw some hope,\u201d said a frustrated driver after reaching Mysore. \u201cI could see my home on the right side 5 minutes after starting from office, but then I never found a u-turn. When I did find one, the Google maps lady asked me to keep going straight and I missed it!\u201d he further lamented. \\nEven Google Maps isn\u2019t able to understand the sudden changes by Bangalore traffic police. \u201cOur users have been banging their cars into dividers. When our map says take a u-turn, there never is one. That\u2019s the magic of Bangalore Traffic police,\u201d said a developer working on Google maps. \\nMeanwhile, Bangalore Traffic police has termed this as \u201csuspense driving\u201d, in which the driver is always alert. \u201cU-turns should be a suspense and we are going to make this game even more interesting,\u201d said a policeman. \\n(Reported by Citizen Satirist Manish Paul .
