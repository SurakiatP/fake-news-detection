The new \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d directed by Paul Feig and featuring women in the main roles, took in about $46 million over the weekend at theaters in the United States and Canada. It was only good enough for second place, behind Illumination Entertainment\u2019s \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets\u201d (Universal) which collected an estimated $50. 6 million in its second weekend, for a new domestic total of $203. 2 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. But ticket sales for \u201cGhostbusters\u201d were strong enough to merit revelry nonetheless. \u201cWe\u2019re totally ecstatic,\u201d Josh Greenstein, Sony\u2019s president of marketing and distribution, said by phone. Resuscitating any film franchise that has been absent from theaters for 27 years (ever since \u201cGhostbusters II\u201d arrived in 1989) is extremely difficult. In this case, Sony had the additional challenge of facing down internet trolls unhappy about the casting of Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Kristen Wiig. In Hollywood, trouble like \u201cGhostbusters\u201d faced before its release can either prompt damaging studio infighting, as executives squabble over what to do, or it can galvanize a management team in new ways. Sony, currently in last place among the six major studios as measured by annual domestic ticket sales, has undergone an extreme makeover in the last 17 months, with Thomas E. Rothman taking over as movie chief in February 2015. \u201cThe team really pulled together,\u201d Mr. Greenstein said. Even so, Sony and Village Roadshow spent $144 million to make \u201cGhostbusters\u201d  \u2014   ads cost at least $100 million more  \u2014   leaving the film a long way from profitability. Sony is counting on foreign ticket sales, although China, the world\u2019s No. 2 box office market, is unlikely to clear the   film for release. Mr. Greenstein said he expected the generously reviewed reboot to perform well in the weeks ahead. \u201cPaul\u2019s movies have big, huge, high multiples, and there are no big comedies on the horizon,\u201d he said. Amid more straightforward summer remakes and sequels, \u201cthe movie is both new and nostalgic, which makes it stand out,\u201d he added. For the weekend, \u201cThe Legend of Tarzan\u201d (Warner Bros.) was third, taking in about $11. 1 million, for a   total of $103. 1 million. Also of note: Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d (Lionsgate) got off to a strong start in five theaters, collecting $355, 000.'"}, "time": 1742562059.4518836}
