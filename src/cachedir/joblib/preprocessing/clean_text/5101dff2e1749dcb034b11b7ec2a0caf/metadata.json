After the winter holidays, I often hear people blame alcohol for added pounds, not just from its caloric contribution but also because it can undermine   and stimulate the appetite and desire for fattening foods. Yet you probably know people who routinely drink wine with dinner, or a cocktail before it, and never put on an unwanted pound. Given that moderate drinkers tend to live longer than teetotalers, I\u2019d love a glass of wine or a beer with dinner if I could do so without gaining, so I looked into what science has to say about alcohol\u2019s influence on weight. Despite thousands of studies spanning decades, I discovered that alcohol remains one of the most controversial and confusing topics for people concerned about controlling their weight. I plowed through more than two dozen research reports, many with conflicting findings on the relationship between alcohol and weight, and finally found a thorough review of the science that can help people determine whether drinking might be compatible with effective weight management. The review, published in 2015 in Current Obesity Reports, was prepared by Gregory Traversy and   Chaput of the Healthy Active Living and Obesity Research Group at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute in Ottawa, Ontario. The reviewers first examined     studies, studies that assessed links between alcohol intake and body mass index among large groups of people at a given moment in time. The most common finding was that, in men on average, drinking was \u201cnot associated\u201d with weight, whereas among women, drinking either did not affect weight or was actually associated with a lower body weight than among nondrinkers. Their summary of the findings: Most such studies showed that \u201cfrequent light to moderate alcohol intake\u201d  \u2014   at most two drinks a day for men, one for women  \u2014   \u201cdoes not seem to be associated with obesity risk. \u201d However, binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on an occasion) and heavy drinking (more than four drinks in a day for men, or more than three for women) were linked to an increased risk of obesity and an expanding waistline. And in a departure from most of the other findings, some of the research indicated that for adolescents and (alas) older adults, alcohol in any amount may \u201cpromote overweight and a higher body fat percentage. \u201d Prospective studies, which are generally considered to be more rigorous than   studies and which follow groups of people over time, in this case from several months to 20 years, had varied results and produced \u201cno clear picture\u201d of the relationship between alcohol and weight. Several found either no relationship or a negative relationship, at least in women, while others found that men who drank tended to risk becoming obese, especially if they were beer drinkers. The conclusion from the most recent such studies: While heavy drinkers risked gaining weight, \u201clight to moderate alcohol intake is not associated with weight gain or changes in waist circumference. \u201d The studies Dr. Chaput ranked as \u201cmost reliable\u201d and \u201cproviding the strongest evidence\u201d were controlled experiments in which people were randomly assigned to consume given amounts of alcohol under monitored conditions. One such study found that drinking two glasses of red wine with dinner daily for six weeks did not result in weight gain or a greater percentage of body fat in 14 men, when compared with the same diet and exercise regimen without alcohol. A similar study among 20 overweight, sedentary women found no meaningful change in weight after 10 weeks of consuming a glass of wine five times a week. However, the experimental studies were small and the \u201cintervention periods\u201d were short. Dr. Chaput noted that even a very small weight gain over the course of 10 weeks can add up to a lot of extra pounds in five years unless there is a compensating reduction in food intake or increase in physical activity. Unlike protein, fats and carbohydrates, alcohol is a toxic substance that is not stored in the body. Alcohol calories are used for fuel, thus decreasing the body\u2019s use of other sources of calories. That means people who drink must eat less or exercise more to maintain their weight. Dr. Chaput said he is able to keep from gaining weight and body fat despite consuming \u201cabout 15 drinks a week\u201d by eating a healthy diet, exercising daily and monitoring his weight regularly. Big differences in drinking patterns between men and women influence the findings of alcohol\u2019s effects on weight, he said. \u201cMen are more likely to binge drink and to drink beer and spirits, whereas women mostly drink wine and are more likely than men to compensate for extra calories consumed as alcohol. \u201d Genetics are also a factor, Dr. Chaput said, suggesting that alcohol can be more of a problem among people genetically prone to excessive weight gain. \u201cPeople who are overweight to begin with are more likely to gain weight if they increase their alcohol intake,\u201d he said. Furthermore, as I and countless others have found, alcohol has a \u201cdisinhibiting\u201d effect and can stimulate people to eat more when food is readily available. \u201cThe extra calories taken in with alcohol are stored as fat,\u201d he reminded drinkers. Here\u2019s the bottom line: Everyone is different. The studies cited above average the results among groups of people and thus gloss over individual differences. Even when two people start out weighing the same and eat, drink and exercise the same amount, adding alcohol to the mix can have different consequences. The critical ingredient is  : weighing yourself regularly, even daily, at the same time of day and under the same circumstances. If you\u2019re a moderate drinker and find yourself gradually putting on weight, try cutting down on, or cutting out, alcohol for a few months to see if you lose, gain or stay the same. Or, if you\u2019re holding off on drinking but gradually gaining weight and have no medical or personal reason to abstain from alcohol, you might try having a glass of wine on most days to see if your weight stabilizes or even drops slightly over the coming months. You might also consult a reliable source on the sometimes surprising differences in calorie content among similar alcoholic drinks.
