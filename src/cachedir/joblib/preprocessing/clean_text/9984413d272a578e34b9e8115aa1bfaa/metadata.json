Treating them is difficult, but luckily, we have a few natural solutions which will help you treat them from the comfort of your own home. Tea Rosemary tea is particularly effective against the symptoms of fungal infections. The tea can also be used for daily intimate care. To treat yeast infections, drink 1-4 cups of rosemary tea a day, and in cases of fungal infections, you should drink blueberry juice a couple of times a day. You can also eat fresh blueberries or take cranberry extract for the same problem. Oils Some essential oils have powerful antifungal properties that can relieve infections. You can soak a tampon in tea tree oil and insert it into your vagina to treat vaginal infections. Leave the tampon in for a couple of hours and repeat the process twice a day for best results. Oregano oil provides a similar effect, and can be applied topically diluted with olive oil. Taking two capsules of oregano oil extract every day and you will defeat the infection in just a week or two. Garlic Garlic is great against yeast infections. We recommend applying a garlic paste on the affected area, or consuming a mixture made of garlic, oil, vitamin E capsules and coconut oil. Vinegar Pour a cup of apple cider vinegar in a tub of hot water, then soak in it for 20 minutes to relieve fungal and yeast infections. Marigold Marigold has great antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. Take a couple of marigold leaves, then mash them and apply the paste on the affected area to get rid of the infection. The treatment should be avoided during pregnancy. source:'"}, "time": 1742562199.4825323}
