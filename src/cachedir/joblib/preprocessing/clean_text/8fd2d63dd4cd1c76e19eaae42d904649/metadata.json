[Tillerson\u2019s first public engagement in Japan was a joint press conference with his Japanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. Tillerson branded the approach to Pyongyang by both the Obama and Bush administrations a failure, noting that \u201cthe United States provided $1. 35 billion in assistance to North Korea as an encouragement to take a different pathway\u201d and got no results on moderating the communist Kim regime.  He directed the government of China, North Korea\u2019s closest and most formidable ally, to pressure North Korea into adhering to international legal standards. \u201cWe look to China to fulfill its obligations and fully implement the sanctions called for,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIn the face of this   threat, it is clear that a different approach is required,\u201d Tillerson told reporters. \u201cThe purpose of  \u2014   part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach. \u201d Tillerson also emphasized the need for \u201ctrilateral cooperation\u201d with an increasingly unstable South Korea, which just impeached   president Park   and is set to elect leftist rival Moon   in a special May presidential election. \u201cTrilateral cooperation allows our three nations to coordinate actions on major regional and global problems, and more effectively counter the threats posed by North Korea,\u201d Tillerson said. President Donald Trump has personally emphasized the need for strengthening bilateral ties and rejected the use of multilateral talks as a diplomatic device. On his end, Kishida emphasized that, during talks with Tillerson, the two chief diplomats were \u201cin sync\u201d on how to approach the region\u2019s most complicated problems. \u201cOn North Korean question, we shared the position that we absolutely cannot condone nuclear as well as missile development by North Korea,\u201d Kishida said, adding that both sides \u201cdiscussed on [sic] the important role that China can play in this regard. \u201d Kishida also thanked Tillerson and the U. S. government generally for their support in the East China Sea where Beijing has claimed the Japanese Senkaku Islands. Tillerson will meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday before flying to South Korea. Tillerson will arrive in China on Saturday, March 18, and meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He is expected to bring the same message of responsibility for the North Korean regime to Beijing as he did to Japan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry, however, is attempting to convince reporters that they expect minimal conflict during Tillerson\u2019s visit. During a press event on Wednesday, Premier Li Keqiang said he was \u201coptimistic about the future of   relations\u201d and insisted China is committed to enforcing United Nations resolutions against North Korea. \u201cIt is true that recently the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia more generally has become tense,\u201d Li said, urging \u201call the parties concerned will work together to   the situation, get issues back on the track of dialogue and try to find lasting solutions. It\u2019s common sense that no one wants to see turbulence at his doorstep. \u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying was clearer in condemning both North Korea and South Korea  \u2014   and, by proxy, the United States  \u2014   for escalating tensions in the region. \u201cThe current situation on the Korean Peninsula is highly sensitive and complex. If relevant sides truly hope to see peace and stability in this region, they should apply the brake and put out the fire, instead of adding fuel to the flame,\u201d she told reporters Tuesday, clearly intending to exclude China from her list of \u201crelevant parties. \u201d As usual, Chinese state media outlets went further in claiming China has only a small role to play in controlling North Korea. \u201cSome Western media outlets blamed the current chaos on China\u2019s friendly policy toward North Korea, arguing that Beijing should impose tougher sanctions on Pyongyang to curb the latter\u2019s nuclear ambitions. This is unfair and groundless,\u201d the Global Times protested this week. \u201cBy shifting the full responsibility on Beijing, the Western countries, especially the US, attempt to exploit the nuclear issue to strategically contain China in the region. This makes the already chaotic situation more sensitive and complicated. \u201d \u201cThe US cares more about its strategic aims than regional peace, and has failed to play an active role that it is supposed to as a major power in promoting peace and stability on the peninsula,\u201d the Times concludes. China provides North Korea with \u201c90 percent of its fuel and 80 percent of its general use goods,\u201d according to recent reports. Beijing recently halted all shipments of coal from North Korea for the rest of the year, claiming it a necessary move to adhere to UN sanctions. The announcement followed the assassination of Kim   dictator Kim  \u2019s brother, in Malaysia using VX agent, a weapon of mass destruction. Malaysian authorities have traced the killers\u2019 ties back to North Korea.'"}, "time": 1742563286.9499795}
