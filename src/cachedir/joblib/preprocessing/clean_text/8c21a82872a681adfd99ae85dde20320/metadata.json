{"duration": 1.810135841369629, "input_args": {"text": "\"=By= Jimmie Moglia Editor's Note The mechanism of control of the population is hiding in plain sight. It is the unwavering focus on self. Whether it is self-help, self-exploration, the inner self, the inner child, the focus is inward and a lifetime of training in narcissism. However, it is the planting of a seed that roots so deep that is on one hand and uncertainty of self, and on the other is a gut level distrust of the world. Then it is all muxed so thoroughly that there is a constant need of reassurance and the psycho babble self help self first over all. Welcome to faux individualism twenty-first century style. \u201c\u2026 I talk of dreams, which are the children of an idle brain, begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind \\nRomeo and Juliet, act 1, sc. 4 W e know of the war on drugs, the war on terror, the war on crime and sundry others. Less known is the war on common sense. It is waged daily on the victims and preys of the Self-help and Actualization Movement, or SHAM. It is a 9 billion $/year industry selling verbal fluff, illusion and fraud with total impunity.\\nThe impunity is guaranteed by the implicit and indirect association of the self-help industry with organized religion. The difference being that whereas religion sells happiness in the next life, self-help sells success in the current, under the guise of fulfilling the customer\u2019s dreams. For, taking issue with the claims of the former is unthinkable. Hence organized religion provides a wide umbrella for all kinds of activities promising results without proof of delivery. \\nThe army of the self-help salesmen consists of instructors with over-inflated and/or non existing credentials, veritable \u201criddling merchants for the nonce,\u201d (1) promising to buyers that the winter of their discontent (2) will bloom into the summer of their satisfaction, if they purchase their advice at a considerable price. \\nThey flatter the imagination with glittering ideas of wealth, power and ultimate fulfillment, easily obtainable by just wishing for them. Their \u2018recipes\u2019 for self-help are like Polonius\u2019 \u201c springes to catch woodcocks \u201d (3) and those woodcocked by television, tabloid magazines and infomercials. \\nThe self-help \u201cinstructors\u201d are thousands \u2013 they deliver their pearls of wisdom, with statements like, for example, \u201cYa gotta want it!\u201d The utterer of this profound truth was Tommy Lasorda, an ex baseball player turned helper for the self-helpless. He charges or charged $30,000 an hour for advice as follows, \u201cThe difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person\u2019s determination.\u201d \\nThe encyclopedia of platitudes and nonsense-in-drags supplied by self-help providers would be thick \u2013 I can only quote some examples. \\nHere is an extract from the manual \u201cStop Selling, Start Partnering \u2013 The New Thinking About Finding and Keeping Customers.\u201d \\nCustomers learn the new mode of thought at the Pecos River Learning Center in New Mexico. The three-day course combines classroom-style learning with physically challenging outdoor activities, such as falling off walls and descending mountain walls attached to a rope. Other similar centers include self-confidence building by resisting starvation or thirst. But here is a winning ticket from the Pecos River Learning Center (italics as in the original) \u201cPlaying to Win. We called this spirit, visit life strategy, playing to win. Playing to Win is the alternative strategy to playing not to lose. Playing to Win has nothing to do with the conventional understanding of winning, which is that if I win, someone else has to lose. Playing to win is a personal strategy defined as going as far as you can with all that you\u2019ve got. The underlying tenet of blank to win is that life is about growing, accepting challenges, and never giving up. The most fulfilled, productive, and loving lives are those in which people have overcome challenges, have grown as a result, and constantly go as far as they can with everything they\u2019ve got. Make no mistake. Playing to win is by far the more difficult strategy, because we often need to endure a short term pain to achieve long-term gain. For example saying you want to start your own business. That usually means you must quit your current job, get a second mortgage on your home, run the risk of failing, and struggle for a few years before it pays off. In the end, if it does stay off, you get to enjoy feelings of fulfillment and success. Yet, most people, when considering the choice, shy away from commitment, from the risk and the possibility of discomfort.\u201d \\nAnyone can see that \u201cPlaying to win\u201d compounds obviousness with emptiness. Here, and in hundred similar cases, we are witnessing evidence that \u201cThe empty vessel makes the greatest sound.\u201d (4) \\nAnd yet, it is emptiness that survives even death. When the founder of the \u201cPecos River Learning Center\u201d died, in his obituary it was possible to read, \u201cLarry Wilson, who provided training through Wilson Learning and Pecos River Learning Center to a wide range of organizations that included Disney, the Minnesota Vikings and the CIA, has died.\u201d \\nUnsaid was, however, that after the Minnesota Vikings undertook the extremely expensive training, the team arrived last in the championship of that year. We must shudder to think what results the CIA achieved, after mastering the art of \u201cPlaying to Win.\u201d \\nThe Pecos River Learning Center was later sold to another similar conglomerate for 16 million $. \\nSelf-Help organizations, or self-helper individuals posing as organizations are in the thousands. I choose at random the \u201cOption Institute.\u201d Among many different \u201ccourses\u201d here is the \u201cInner Strength Boot Camp\u201d \u2013 a week-long program that will lighten the purse of each student of 4,650 dollars. \\nBaffled about a boot camp for \u201cInner Strength\u201d? No problem. Here is the explanation, quote We\u2019re all familiar with the term \u201cboot camp.\u201d An intensive, no-holds-barred, all-out, 8-cylinder experience where participants walk through the fires of deep personal challenge. And, in the end, they have rebuilt themselves into something \u2013 someone \u2013 vastly stronger and more powerful. Inner Strength BOOT CAMP takes this concept deeper. In truth, we can go through an \u201couter\u201d strength boot camp, but no amount of physical exercise prepares us for the heavy lifting we face in our lives \u2013 financially, with our health, in our relationships, and within our careers. In the end it all comes down to Inner Strength \u2013 creating a way for ourselves to think and feel so that we have an unwavering, unstoppable, indestructible sense of our own strength, confidence, self-acceptance, and clarity. To accomplish this, we\u2019ve constructed a course that powers through nine straight days of intensive work on you. (But you\u2019re still only away for one workweek.) In this course, we help you to dig deep into every aspect of yourself. Once you\u2019ve done that, we can (lovingly and non-judgmentally) challenge you to build who you are into the version of yourself that you always wanted to be, always thought you could be, but haven\u2019t quite seen yet. In the end, we may not be able to control everything. But we can become people who determine how we handle everything. We can gain the tools to construct a core of strength, confidence, and clarity on the inside that\u2019s impervious to events on the outside. We can be our own rock. And that\u2019s why Inner Strength BOOT CAMP isn\u2019t about changing the world. It\u2019s about changing YOUR world. Would you like to: *** Remain truly relaxed and unfazed in the face of the judgments and criticism of others? *** Know who you are \u2013 without taking what others do personally or needing them to validate you? *** Create more loving relationships with the people that matter most to you? *** Overcome the obstacles that keep you from being present to what\u2019s really important in your life? *** Speak authentically without fear? *** Sustain a sense of peace and comfort with an unpredictable world? *** Stay strong in what you believe and what you want? *** Understand exactly how you work\u2026so you can change and rebuild the parts that don\u2019t? If so, Inner Strength BOOT CAMP is for you. The way it works is that you arrive on Friday night, and then go full-blast from Saturday until the next Sunday. You will be shocked at how far you can get by taking a course in this totally immersive style (while still only being away for one workweek). Some special methods unique to Inner Strength BOOT CAMP: *** The Inner Strength Diary:A unique method of tracking your changes \u2013 and keeping yourself accountable *** Happiness Interaction Training Tactics (HITTS): Practical strategies getting people to treat you the way you want to be treated while living what you\u2019ve learned *** The Book:The most powerful interactive exercise we\u2019ve ever taught for learning to be totally present and focused *** The Two Sides of You: A special activity where we use digital enhancement technology to show you sides of yourself you might never have imagined *** What If???:A navigational path we help you create for yourself that allows you to completely trust your ability to take care of yourself \u2013 no matter what *** The \u201cAsk Anything\u201d Project: A method allow you to to get to know your fellow participants \u2013 and anyone else in your life \u2013 in a unique way unquote \\nAnd, should you still have doubts about the uniqueness of all this obviousness, there is an abundance of \u201ctestimonials.\u201d People providing them span the range of human characters and are engaged in all pursuits that swarm upon the earth, from chef/caterers to software engineers. Here is the testimonial from a chef/caterer. quote I signed up for Inner Strength with a feeling that if it didn\u2019t help, I\u2019d be lost. Not only did the program give me practical, easy-to-use tools to help build my inner strength, it also helped me discover strengths I did not know I had. I\u2019m now equipped to face anything in my path, and to deal with all issues with clarity and happiness. My life is no longer a battleground \u2013 it\u2019s a playground! unquote \\nBut where are the roots and which are the reasons for the extraordinary success of this ultimate industry of fluff? \\nIt is a case of \u201cVirtue itself turns vice, being misapplied\u2026\u201d (5) For, the idea of obtaining instructions on the ways of the world is as old as the Bible, the Greeks and the Romans. In my view, the best \u201cself-help\u201d manual ever written is still Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius\u2019 \u201cMeditations.\u201d \\nMore recently, in 1937 Dale Carnegie published \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People.\u201d The appeal of the book, in my view, consists not so much in the advice, which is sound, but in making the reader feel better emotionally. In fact, though by and large people do not behave at all as the manual suggests, the reader realizes that cultivating humanitarian and genteel feelings towards others has some kind of official sanction \u2013 even if, in practice and too often, kindness and openness are rated as symptoms of weakness. Unless, of course the \u201cinfluenced people\u201d see profit in being influenced. \\nThe same considerations apply to N.V. Peale\u2019s \u201cThe Power of Positive Thinking.\u201d It is amply proven that when man is no longer cold, hungry or fearful, he becomes unhappy. It is \u201c\u2026 the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul.\u201d (6) The book suggests measures to alleviate the symptoms. \\nNevertheless, the seminal event, triggering the chain reaction of self-help mania, was the 1967 book \u201cI\u2019m OK \u2013 You are OK.\u201d Which, by the way, prompted the much more realistic publication of \u201cI am dysfunctional, you are dysfunctional.\u201d \\nYet, \u201cThere is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things.\u201d (7) It is not by chance that the blossoming of the self-help industry coincided with the de-industrialization of the country, the \u201cdownsizings\u201d, the \u201cconsolidations\u201d and the explosive growth of part-time jobs. In essence, the factual impoverishment of the country paralleled the enrichment of the financial industry, which essentially is air, or rather paper, for practical reasons. Paper can be more easily manhandled, maneuvered, hidden, stolen and monopolized, hence the dramatic divergence in prosperity between the 1% and the rest. \\nUnable to fight back, \u201cthe miserable have no other medicine but only hope.\u201d (8) Searching for solutions, large sections of the populace became the natural target (or victims) of the self-help industry. Whose psychological modus operandi is as follows: Dissecting the meaning of basic ideas such as right and wrong, good and bad, winning and losing etc. Giving alternative new connotations to words and concepts, e.g. family, love, discipline, blame, excellence and self-esteem. \\nAfterwards, or as a result of this lexical sleigh-of-hand, the \u2018market\u2019 is split into two segments: The victims, whose motto is \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault\u201d, and The empowerers, whose motto is \u201cI think, therefore I win, I daydream, therefore I accomplish.\u201d \\nThe victimhood syndrome has found acceptance even outside the realm of the self-help industry. As I was writing this article, the daily newspaper of where I live, told the story of a criminal just condemned to 10 years in jail. He had stolen someone\u2019s car, and a few days later, by chance, the rightful owner of the car spotted it in the parking lot of a store. Having another set of key, he opened the door of his car. Whereupon the thief reached him, threw him to the ground, stomped on his head and almost killed him \u2013 leaving him permanently disabled. \\nI think the sentence was lenient. But the defendant, with a 30-year long career in crime, brought up in his defense, his troubled childhood (i.e. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault.\u201d) \\nBut I digress. \\nThe victimhood syndrome has also successfully instilled into people, especially women, worry, guilt, insecurity and inadequacy, turning an otherwise (possibly) uneventful life into a permanent winter of discontent. \\nThe empowerers, or rather the sense of empowerment has convinced people that simply aspiring to do something is the same as achieving it. \u201cFeeling good\u201d about oneself and \u201cpositive self-worth\u201d are more important than the much more challenging task of acquiring the skills required to gain recognition. \\nThe \u201cself-help\u201d mania has a kind of counterpart, for example, in the \u201cJesus Festivals\u201d held by prosperous and opulent preachers in the mega-churches of the US Bible Belt. \\nYet, the desire to unquestionably accept the unbelievable runs deep in the American soul. In 1830, Frances Trollope, mother of the successful English novelist Anthony Trollope undertook a 2-year voyage to America, followed by the publication of a fascinating book, \u201cThe Domestic Manners of the Americans,\u201d in which she also describes a religious \u201crevival.\u201d \u201cThe preacher described with ghastly minuteness, the last feeble fainting moments of human life, and then the gradual progress of decay after death, which he followed through every process up to the last loathsome stage of decomposition\u2026 Suddenly he bent forward as if to gaze on some object beneath the pulpit\u2026 And the preacher made known to us what he saw in the pit that seemed to open before him. The device was certainly a happy one for giving the effect to his description of hell. Repeatedly he invited and exhorted the young girls of the congregation not to be ashamed of Jesus, but to put themselves upon \u201cthe anxious benches\u201d and lay their heads on his bosom. After that, three priests walked down and began whispering to the poor girls seated at the \u201canxious benches\u201d. These whispers were inaudible to us, but the sobs and groans increased to a frightful excess. Young creatures, with features pale and distorted, fell on their knees on the pavement and soon sunk forward on their faces; the most violent cries and shrieks followed, while from time to time a voice was heard in convulsive accents exclaiming, \u201cOh Lord, Oh Lord Jesus, help me Jesus\u201d and the like. Violent hysterics and compulsions seized many of them, and when the tumult was at the highest, the priest who remained above, again gave out a hymn as if to drown it.\u201d \\nTrollope concludes, \u201cIt was a frightful sight to behold innocent young creatures, in the gay morning of existence, thus seized upon, horror-struck and rendered feeble and enervated for ever. \u2026 For myself, I confess that I think the coarsest comedy ever written would be a less detestable exhibition for the eyes of youth and innocence than such a scene.\u201d \\nReturning to the present, the self-help movement has evolved from the personal realm to include the political. It is a contributing factor, for example in the adherence to the so-called political correctness, daughter of both victimization, or the culture of blame, and the self-esteem movement, a product of empowerment. \\nBut, inspired by the vision of large profits at little or no cost, self-help (in the sense of platitudinal advise sold at high price), has branched even into hospitals and universities. \\nThe World Health Organization now defines health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d Starting from this platform, any reader can deduce that the sky is the limit. The Organization allocates funds to \u201cwellness-based\u201d models, which include research on loneliness and special after-school play programs, all aimed at achieving the \u2018state of perfect health.\u2019 \\nThrough the same reasoning, public health official have invested millions in so-called \u201coutreach programs\u201d for drug abusers. Here is a declaration by an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, on the subject of women of color contracting HIV from dirty needles and unprotected sex, \u201cIn response to daily assault of racial prejudice and denial of dignity, women may turn to readily available mind-altering substance for relief. Seeking sanctuary from racial hatred through sexual connection as a way to enhance self-esteem, also may offer rewards so compelling that condom use becomes less of a priority.\u201d It\u2019s pure victimization at work, and out go the millions for other self-help programs, as their respective deliverers laugh all the way to the bank. \\nEven mid-sized companies engage high-priced lecturers to inspire motivation through \u2018positive thinking,\u2019 though there is no evidence of any positive effect. Considering that often, the company promoters of these program are the very ones who contradict the principles that the programs are supposed to inspire. \\nOr take the case of the sales seminar where the trainer tells 250 real-estate professionals from the same company that all of them could be the number one salesmen of the year. Self-help can even defy the most simple of mathematics. One of the salesmen will be, the others won\u2019t. \\nSelf-help has surreptitiously changed at large the general outlook on life. From, \u201cThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill go together: our virtues would be proud, if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues\u201d (9) to the philosophy embodied in the popular bumper sticker \u2018BADASSE\u2019 \u2013 Blame All Disappointments And Setbacks On Someone Else.\u201d \\nBy default, design, skill or luck, the self-help industry has found the formula for \u2018success.\u2019 Familiar sounding words applied in a different context puzzle the will (as in the example above, \u201cInner Strength Boot Camp.\u201d) And hyperbolical images that fire the imagination prompt the willing victim to believe the unbelievable rather than accepting the inherent uncertainties of life. \\nIn the end, self-help makes cowards of its victims, whose hue of resolution is sicklied over by the pale cast of thought, (10) or rather, by the evanescent and ridiculous promises destined to melt into air, into thin air. While the baseless fabric of the self-help visions, (11 ) the promised successes, praises, glories, wealth and happiness, dissolve, and leave only expensive bills behind. \\nAnd, as writer Steve Salerno has aptly concluded in his book SHAM, from where I extracted some of the examples, \u201cThe Self Help Industry has made America Helpless.\u201d \\n** 1.
