[Marlow referenced a new profile of Buchanan published by Politico in which he explains that he approaches politics from the perspective of a historian. Marlow proposed that the historical ignorance of so many voters on both left and right is dangerous.  LISTEN: \u201cI have to agree with you, Alex,\u201d said Buchanan. \u201cOne thing that bothers me is really the lack of knowledge of history not only going back into the history of the country, back to its founding and what happened up in the 19th and 20th centuries, but you talk to a number of folks  \u2014   even good friends and political allies, young people  \u2014   and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re referring to. The examples you use, they know nothing about. \u201d  \u201cI think this depriving America\u2019s young people of the knowledge of the history of their country and the political battles left and right, everything going back into the 20th century and the 19th century, I think is a real injustice to American youth because they don\u2019t have the real ability to base what they\u2019re saying in examples in history,\u201d he lamented. \u201cMost of these battles we\u2019ve seen before. \u201d Buchanan said he was gratified and \u201castonished\u201d that Donald Trump picked up on so many of his own key issues during the 2016 presidential campaign. He believes these issues helped propel Trump to victory, even though \u201ceveryone was writing him off as a joke. \u201d \u201cI said that these issues, which we had raised in the 1990s  \u2014   mainly the results of quote \u2018free trade,\u2019 globalism, also of open borders immigration, of failures to secure the borders, and also of the Bush   II interventions and wars in the Middle East  \u2014   that these were going to come back to haunt the United States of America,\u201d he said, referring to his own presidential campaigns in 1992, 1996, and 2000. \u201cThe truth was, we raised those issues back in the nineties, and we said this is what\u2019s going to happen: you\u2019re going to lose half your manufacturing base in this country if you go along with NAFTA and GATT and MFN for China and these other trade policies which basically were giveaways of American industry,\u201d he recalled.  \u201cWhat Trump had going for him was he had the results of America having taken the wrong course on all of these issues. We left the borders unprotected. We enacted one after another of these trade deals to the benefit of communist China and Mexico and Japan and other countries. And of course, we plunged into one after another of these wars in the Middle East, not looking at where we were going to wind up after we put our flag over the Capitol. So Trump had the benefit of the consequences of the United States having failed to take the right course in the 1990s under Bush I and Bill Clinton,\u201d said Buchanan. Marlow said he was concerned that \u201cwho has the president\u2019s ear inside the White House are not the populists and the nationalists and the conservatives that got him elected. \u201d Buchanan said he shared that concern. \u201cI do believe this, Alex: once Trump won, he was the leader of the Republican Party,\u201d he added. \u201cNow, there are many issues on which I remain a solid conservative Republican as I\u2019ve always been. On the Supreme Court, for example, on the slow growth of government rather than these big programs, on belief in the private sector, and belief in cutting the corporate tax rates and making America more competitive in the world. \u201d  \u201cBut at the same time, there are these new issues: securing America\u2019s borders, protecting the sovereignty of the United States,\u201d he continued. \u201cStop forfeiting our sovereignty and independence of action that was won for us, back    years ago. Stop forfeiting that to some new world order and globalist  . So on all these issues, I felt that you had a marriage, a potential marriage here between the Republican base, the conservative base, and the new   conservatives  \u2014   and that these two forces together, if they stayed united, could get a tremendous amount done. We\u2019re not going to agree on everything. \u201d \u201cMy concern has been that it hasn\u2019t really come off as smoothly as one would have hoped. Quite frankly, there\u2019s an awful lot of forces in this city of Washington, DC, where I was born and raised, that really want to cashier and dump the   agenda. Excuse me, but that\u2019s the future of the world. You take a look at countries all over the world. Populism,   economic nationalism, sovereignty concerns, identity concerns  \u2014   these are what is moving mankind. With all due respect, the European Union is yesterday,\u201d Buchanan said. Marlow invited Buchanan to define \u201cnationalism,\u201d one of the most contentious terms in contemporary political discourse. \u201cLook, all of us are American citizens, everyone here who has taken the oath of loyalty to the government of the nation of the United States. But in the world arena, it means that we look out first and foremost for the national interests of the United States of America. We are not acolytes of some ideology, some globalist ideology that dates back to Immanuel Kant and people like that, where we\u2019re going to create some new world order and we\u2019re going to fit ourselves into that,\u201d Buchanan replied. \u201cAlso that we are a country, a unique people with its own culture, with its own identity, with its own history, its own heroes, its own holidays, its own cuisine,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are a separate nation, a different nation from other nations, and in looking out for this, we look out for basically what is our own national family first. \u201d  \u201cThis is why governments are formed,\u201d he argued. \u201cIf you go back to \u2018Federalist 2\u2019 and read what John Jay wrote in there about us sharing various principles and histories and memories, that we are unique and we are separate, we\u2019re not just citizens of the world. I reject that. The   on this earth is about the highest or largest entity to which human beings can give true love and allegiance. \u201d Buchanan laughed heartily when Marlow noted that the mainstream media routinely denounced such views as bigotry, and those views were even more aggressively vilified during Buchanan\u2019s national political campaigns of the nineties.  \u201cI think we defended ourselves fairly ably,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe certainly got mussed up a little bit. In the \u201992 campaign, for example, I came off a Crossfire television show where I articulated my views then. In 1991, ten weeks before the New Hampshire primary, we closed a   gap with the President of the United States to 15 points, and it was something of a sensation then. In 1996 we won Alaska, and then we won the Louisiana caucuses, came in second to Dole in Iowa, and then we won the New Hampshire primary. I think these were successful campaigns. They were not triumphal campaigns, obviously. But we were able to make our case through the national media. \u201d  \u201cIf you go back to when it was really the Dark Ages, I was the author of the Agnew speeches. If you read my new book, Nixon\u2019s White House Wars, Nixon undertook a counterattack on the media when they trashed his great \u2018Silent Majority\u2019 speech in 1969. That was a great battle back in 1969, but at the end of 1969, Richard Nixon was at 68 percent approval and 19 percent disapproval. Spiro T. Agnew, whose speech in Des Moines just savaging the networks as unelected elites imposing their agenda on the nation, was the third   man in America,\u201d he noted.  \u201cNow, if you stood up in those days and made these statements and said what you believed, you could find tremendous echoes out in America. That is what some of the new media, conservative media have discovered,\u201d he said.  \u201cThey\u2019ve been very successful. They\u2019ve been created basically in recent years I remember speaking with Mr. Murdock about Fox when he was just starting it up. These were ideas that we had back in the sixties, creating a conservative media and creating conservative institutions. It was sort of the beginning. It\u2019s not a bad thing to be out there on the lines, in the earliest days of the cause, and then to see many of these ideas succeed,\u201d Buchanan said happily. As to whether he was optimistic about the future of the Trump administration, Buchanan professed he was a \u201chistorical pessimist. \u201d \u201cIf you go back and look at the great arc of history and Western civilization, and you see its extraordinary accomplishments, and the fact that the West once really ruled the world, and now the West itself is being colonized and invaded by folks from its former colonies who are changing the character of Western civilization, and, frankly, who disregard many of the traditions and things that we have built, it is hard to be an overall optimist,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut in terms of the shorter term, I was elated with Donald Trump\u2019s election because he ran on these issues: preserving the nation, securing its borders, preserving its independence out of this new world order, getting out of all these Third World wars and the rest of it that I thought was really best for my country,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think he\u2019s really making an effort. There have been some stumbles, obviously, in the early days. But I\u2019m delighted that I voted the way I did, that I supported him and his causes, and I wish him well,\u201d said Buchanan. \u201cIn the longer term, if you take a look at the demographic change taking place in Europe, as I wrote in Death of the West almost 20 years ago, there\u2019s not a single European country that has a birthrate that is going to enable it to replace its  . That\u2019s especially true on the Mediterranean coast. As these places empty out, you have new people who come from destitute countries all across the Med and from the Middle East who are going to cross the Med into Europe,\u201d he predicted.  \u201cI don\u2019t see the national will there to stop this invasion. I see a lot of   talk about how wonderful it\u2019s going to be, but let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not optimistic. My late friend Clare Boothe Luce once said that there are two kinds of people in this world, the optimists and the pessimists, but the pessimists are better informed,\u201d said Buchanan. Buchanan said he was not surprised by the campus left\u2019s growing hostility to free speech, as manifested in riots and blocking conservative speakers from universities. \u201cI don\u2019t think the future is going to be very positive in terms of relations among Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, quite frankly, many Americans dislike and detest each other, as I\u2019ve written many times, and really regard the ideas of their opposites as \u2018 \u2019 and all the other names we\u2019ve been called. \u201d \u201cI think what is happened here is that an ideology, a political religion, has taken hold among America\u2019s elites and especially among America\u2019s young, where they regard statements and expressions of traditional conservative values and beliefs as really intolerable,\u201d he warned. \u201cThey\u2019re racists, they\u2019re sexists, they\u2019re homophobic. They shouldn\u2019t be tolerated because they\u2019re precursors of some sort of fascist future. \u201d  \u201cTherefore, we have to stamp them out, in the way folks in schools would not want people coming in and selling the idea that drugs are good for you and things.   \u2026     These ideas are evil, and we should have no compunction  \u2014   frankly, we should have moral certitude  \u2014   about erasing these ideas because we know the horrendous things they\u2019ve resulted in,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they\u2019re doing this in quite good conscience. I think they\u2019re fanatics, but they\u2019re doing it in good conscience because they sincerely believe what they say about us,\u201d Buchanan observed. \u201cWhen they call us those names  \u2014   what did Hillary say about us?  \u2014   you know, a \u2018basket of deplorables,\u2019 racists, sexists, homophobes, xenophobes, Islamophobes, bigots. That\u2019s what they think about us. \u201d  \u201cI think you can expect, quite frankly, if people believe that about you, and they don\u2019t want you to take power, and you\u2019ve taken power, and you\u2019re going to advance your ideas, then you behave the way they\u2019re behaving. It is not unpredictable what is coming,\u201d he said ominously. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
