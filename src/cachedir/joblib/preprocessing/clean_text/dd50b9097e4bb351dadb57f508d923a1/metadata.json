It\u2019s a way to remake an unhappy reality and exert control (\u201cWerewolves in Their Youth\u201d) a means of grappling with personal or historical disaster (\u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  Clay\u201d) or, in the case of his elegiac and deeply poignant new novel, \u201cMoonglow,\u201d a tool for connecting the dots of a family\u2019s life and making sense of the past. \u201cMoonglow\u201d takes the form of a faux memoir by the narrator, Mike, a writer who bears more than a passing resemblance to the author himself. The story centers on tales told by his maternal grandfather as he lies dying of cancer, high on painkillers that have cracked his habit of silence and made him eager to spill \u201ca record of his misadventures, his ambiguous luck, his feats and failures of timing and nerve. \u201d His grandfather\u2019s disjointed accounts of being a soldier in World War II and his fascination with rocketry and space travel have a hallucinatory,   sheen, and they are tangled up with his wife\u2019s enigmatic and contradictory retellings of her experiences in occupied France. Mr. Chabon weaves these   tales together into a tapestry that\u2019s as complicated, beautiful and flawed as an antique carpet. The novel would have benefited from some rigorous editing  \u2014   there are digressions about business travails,   rockets and \u201cGravity\u2019s Rainbow\u201d that are tedious and superfluous. But the fraying story lines seem to be a deliberate narrative strategy meant to convey the chaos of life and distortions of memory, and the bright threads of meaning that can be extracted, with imagination and will, from the mess. Mr. Chabon is one of contemporary literature\u2019s most gifted prose stylists, and in novels like \u201cTelegraph Avenue\u201d and \u201cThe Yiddish Policemen\u2019s Union,\u201d he\u2019s demonstrated his   mastery, his ability to move effortlessly between the serious and the comic, the existential and merely personal. In \u201cMoonglow,\u201d he writes with both lovely lyricism and highly caffeinated fervor. He conjures Mike\u2019s childhood with Proustian ardor, capturing his fond memories of his mother (who smelled of Prell shampoo, making him think of those old TV commercials showing a pearl languidly drifting through the mentholated green) and his worst boyhood fears (convinced that a gaggle of   puppets were lying in wait, plotting to kill him). He makes Oakland, Calif. in the 1970s come alive  \u2014   and does the same for Baltimore in the 1950s and Florida in the late 1980s. There are sharp, funny portraits of the many eccentric characters who wander through the lives of the narrator\u2019s family, but it\u2019s Mike\u2019s grandfather who bestrides the novel  \u2014   an Augie   hero who careens through life like a wildly thrown bowling ball, knocking over those who stray into his path while nearly crashing his own dreams. He goes at things freestyle, and often seems like the very embodiment, in Mr. Chabon\u2019s mind, of America itself  \u2014   proud, romantic, na\u00efve, impulsive. He\u2019s a roughneck and a dreamer, a pool hustler and a soldier, a jailbird and an engineer enraptured by the space race and the moon shot. \u201cOne glance at you and I know the whole story,\u201d William J. Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services, who recruits him during World War II, says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking for trouble all your life. \u201d His grandfather\u2019s romance with the woman who becomes his wife  \u2014   a French refugee who already has a young daughter (who will grow up to become Mike\u2019s mother)  \u2014   is a love story about two people who build new lives together after the war but who can never really manage to swim free from the undertow of the horror they witnessed in   Europe. His grandfather suffers from a form of   stress disorder, while his grandmother slips into bouts of madness that seem to be part mental illness, part guilt or shame over something that happened to her during the war. The novel\u2019s title and some of its most moving passages come from his grandfather\u2019s fascination with spaceflight. During the war, he becomes obsessed with rocketry and Wernher von Braun  \u2014   the brains behind Nazi Germany\u2019s   rocket, who would later oversee development of the rockets that propelled Americans to the moon. His grandfather drives to Cape Canaveral, Fla. for every space shuttle launch and gets a job with NASA building scale models of aircraft and vehicles as part of the educational and research and development process. He once promised his wife that he would fly her \u201cto find refuge on the moon,\u201d and after her death, he pictures the two of them in spacesuits like the ones worn by the astronauts in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d  \u2014   \u201can orange one for him, a blue one for her\u201d  \u2014   out for a spin in a lunar rover. He imagines her \u201ccutting flowers in her hydroponic garden as the world hid its nightside and peace descended on their refuge in space. \u201d Although \u201cMoonglow\u201d grows overly discursive at times, it is never less than compelling when it sticks to the tale of Mike\u2019s grandparents  \u2014   these damaged survivors of World War II who bequeath to their family a legacy of endurance, and an understanding of the magic powers of storytelling to provide both solace and transcendence.'"}, "time": 1742628603.36953}
