Which raises the question: What was the   version? The comics I read as a kid were an    palimpsest, in which kids with \u201970s haircuts and \u201950s lifestyles tooled around in Archie Andrews\u2019s \u2019  jalopy. Recently, the franchise has been redesigned and reconceived. In one series, an adult Archie dies. In another, he and the gang flee an outbreak of zombies, one of whom is his old pal Jughead Jones. The steamy \u201cRiverdale,\u201d which begins Thursday, owes more to those newer iterations. (The showrunner, Roberto   is the chief creative officer of Archie Comics.) It chucks the comics\u2019 old clich\u00e9s for a new pastiche, drawn from decades of moody teen dramas, that occasionally adds up to something new. The familiar characters are back, as are landmarks like Pop\u2019s Chock\u2019lit Shoppe. But it\u2019s a dark, bitter milkshake that \u201cRiverdale\u201d concocts, built on the suspicion that any town this squeaky clean must be hiding decay, corruption and secrets. And jeepers, are there secrets. The big one surrounds the murder of Jason Blossom (Trevor Stines) who disappeared while on an outing in the woods with his   twin sister Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch). Archie (K. J. Apa)  \u2014   an aspiring musician with   abs  \u2014   witnessed a key bit of evidence but can\u2019t talk because of the circumstances: He was hooking up with his music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel) now a sultry knockout. The whole Archieverse is hotter and more haunted. Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes) the spellbinding rich girl, is now a transplant from Manhattan whose father is in jail for fraud. Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) still pining away in Archie\u2019s   has an older sister who had a breakdown after an entanglement with Jason. It\u2019s a more diverse Riverdale, too, if mainly among the supporting characters. Kevin Keller (Casey Cott) a gay student, was introduced in the recent comics. The mayor, the principal and the girl group Josie and the Pussycats are all  . When Archie asks Josie (Ashleigh Murray) if he might write songs for her group, she scolds him for his white privilege, and he soberly concedes her point. Meet our new Archiekins: not just ripped, but woke. The malt shop is still in business, but the   is closing down. The town is beset with bullying, sexual harassment and abuse. Jughead (Cole Sprouse) the wry,   sidekick of the comics, is now a dour, emo narrator. \u201cGet closer,\u201d he says, \u201cand you start seeing the shadows underneath. \u201d Finding the corrosion under the    chassis of   America is itself an old trope. \u201cRiverdale\u201d flirts with the kinky darkness of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet,\u201d as well as \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d whose M\u00e4dchen Amick plays Betty\u2019s     mother. But the series is closer to teen intrigues like \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl. \u201d \u201cRiverdale\u201d is very conscious of its influences  \u2014   too much so at times. It\u2019s a blizzard of knowing references and characters talking about one another as characters. \u201cYou may be a stock character from a \u201990s teen movie,\u201d Cheryl snipes at Veronica, \u201cbut I\u2019m not. \u201d She\u2019s right  \u2014   Cheryl is more like a stock character from \u201cGlee. \u201d Her line is typical of much of the dialogue in \u201cRiverdale\u201d: It\u2019s clever, but it sounds written. Still, the show has a welcome sense of humor about itself. \u201cRiverdale\u201d is more an ensemble show than the story of Archie, which is fortunate, because here he\u2019s written and played as a flat, brooding bore. In another touch of   he spars with his father, played by Luke Perry, who practically invented soulful teen brooding on \u201cBeverly Hills 90210. \u201d Archie\u2019s gal pals are far more interesting, especially the new, more complex Betty. In the excellent third episode, she and Veronica join forces for a revenge plot against some   jocks  \u2014   a theme, lately, in series like MTV\u2019s \u201c . \u201d Ms. Reinhart plays her vigilante turn with a gusto that conveys years of Betty\u2019s repressing her feelings, and the two girls\u2019 bonding complicates their inevitable love triangle with Archie. (That dynamic is very \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek,\u201d whose Greg Berlanti is an executive producer here.) The early episodes get better the deeper they delve into the murder mystery, despite false notes like members of a biker gang who look like extras from \u201cGrease. \u201d If the tone is not yet consistent, the aesthetic is, a strong sign that \u201cRiverdale\u201d knows what it wants to be. The terrific art direction warps the   iconography into something haunting and lurid. Take Archie and the Blossom twins\u2019 hair  \u2014   so red that it\u2019s clownish, like dyed cotton candy. What the original comics drew as milky and wholesome, \u201cRiverdale\u201d dials up to ghostly and unnatural. The old world of Archie was saccharine, down to the 1969 single by spinoff pop group the Archies, \u201cSugar, Sugar\u201d (which gets an update in the series from the Pussycats). This \u201cRiverdale\u201d suggests that so much sugar, over time, can\u2019t help but make a town a little sick.'"}, "time": 1742628429.3356712}
