[\u201cThe Fake News Media works hard at disparaging  demeaning my use of social media because they don\u2019t want America to hear the real story!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday night.  Trump remained mostly idle on Twitter during his trip overseas, using his account to thank his foreign hosts for an excellent trip. That caught the attention of reporters, who speculated that Trump would be more filtered in the future. \u201cI\u2019ve been told a factor in the lack of tweeting abroad overall was the presence of Melania Trump,\u201d wrote a Politico reporter on Twitter. Trump was expected to travel on Saturday, presumably to his golf course, but the trip was canceled, likely due to rain. Instead, the president spent his afternoon on Twitter challenging the accuracy of stories about the White House. \u201cIt is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhenever you see the words \u2018sources say\u2019 in the fake news media, and they don\u2019t mention names it is very possible that those sources don\u2019t exist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!\u201d Trump also highlighted another big victory for Republicans in Montana, despite   hysteria suggesting that the Republican candidate would lose a special election in the state after \u201cbody slamming\u201d a reporter. \u201cDoes anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems  Fake News until the Republican won?\u201d Trump wrote, calling the story \u201cpoorly covered. \u201d He also criticized leaks of British intelligence from American sources to the news media. \u201cBritish Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U. K. gave to U. S. about Manchester was leaked,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGave me full details!\u201d The president also wrote about his plan for health care and tax cuts. \u201cObamaCare is dead  \u2014   the Republicans will do much better!\u201d he wrote, floating the option of adding more money to fund health care and promised that tax reform was moving along swiftly. \u201cThe massive TAX   that I have submitted is moving along in the process very well, actually ahead of schedule. Big benefits to all!\u201d he wrote. Trump sent 10 messages on Twitter on Saturday, one of the busiest days on the social platform as president. Trump\u2019s social media director Dan Scavino confirmed for reporters that Trump\u2019s use of Twitter would continue. \u201cVarious news reports of attorneys vetting Donald Trump\u2019s tweets are compliments of your #FakeNewsMedia  terrible \u2018sources,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201c#FACT\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564056.379933}
