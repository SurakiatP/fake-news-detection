Trump, who has campaigned for president as a blunt provocateur, dismissing complaints of racial insensitivity as political correctness, took an uncharacteristic step on Saturday: He visited a black church for the first time and tried to blend in. Flanked by a few black supporters, including Ben Carson, a former presidential candidate, and Omarosa Manigault, a former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d Mr. Trump cut a subdued figure here at Great Faith Ministries International. He beamed as congregants greeted him and swayed to the chords of the song \u201cWhat a Mighty God We Serve. \u201d Speaking softly, he invoked the civil rights movement and Abraham Lincoln. Donning a prayer shawl given to him by the church\u2019s pastor, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, Mr. Trump proclaimed, \u201cI feel better already. \u201d Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular with black voters and perceived by many as hostile to their community. His company has faced accusations of discrimination against black tenants he has alleged falsely in the past that President Obama was not born in the United States and as a champion of aggressive policing, he has stirred indignation by caricaturing black neighborhoods as blighted by crime and economic despair. In Detroit, Mr. Trump did not express regret for, or even acknowledge, the actions and remarks that had opened a gulf between him and black voters. Instead, reading from prepared remarks, he hailed the Christian values and political contributions of black Americans and told his audience he cared about making their lives better. \u201cI fully understand that the   community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding: \u201cFor any who are hurting: Things are going to turn around. Tomorrow will be better. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to the church concluded a week of fitful outreach to black and Hispanic voters, capping off a frenzied campaign schedule that took him to Mexico\u2019s presidential palace, to a meeting in North Philadelphia with black leaders, and finally to Detroit. Far more than a typical Republican presidential candidate, Mr. Trump faces a wall of opposition from nonwhite voters. He records virtually no support from black voters in the polls. Their resistance has emerged as one of the most important impediments to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, threatening to put several major swing states, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, entirely out of reach. Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance on Saturday, long billed by campaign aides as a pivotal opportunity to reintroduce himself to black voters, was swathed in uncertainty up to the last minute, as the Trump campaign and the pastor deliberated over whether the Republican nominee would actually speak at the church. Plans for stops in nearby neighborhoods were announced, then retracted Mr. Trump ultimately paid a short visit to Mr. Carson\u2019s childhood home before flying out of Detroit. And a scheduled interview with Mr. Jackson, Mr. Trump\u2019s host on Saturday, became a source of embarrassment when it was revealed that both the questions and Mr. Trump\u2019s answers had been scripted in advance. Mr. Trump taped the television appearance before the church service on Saturday, and it is expected to air in the next few days on Mr. Jackson\u2019s Christian cable network. Mr. Jackson acknowledged offhand the unusual spectacle of Mr. Trump\u2019s presence in his church. Introducing Mr. Trump, Mr. Jackson noted with a chuckle, \u201cThis is the first   church he\u2019s been in. \u201d Mr. Jackson had planned to let Mr. Trump speak for just one minute, but at a reception before the service, aides to Mr. Trump asked Mr. Jackson for more time, and he granted it. \u201cHis people said, \u2018Mr. Trump had already written this out and he really feels that if he can say it, it would really be a blessing because this is his heart,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jackson said in an interview. In his relatively muted address, lasting roughly 10 minutes, Mr. Trump did not employ his typical heated language about urban crime or illegal immigration. Instead, he offered praise for black Christians and called for a \u201ccivil rights agenda for our time,\u201d including support for charter schools and new job growth. And Mr. Trump, who has not made professions of faith a regular element of his campaign, called on Americans to \u201cturn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. \u201d Leaving the church, Mr. Trump made a stop at the former residence of Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s steadfast political allies. Bantering briefly with the current owner, Felicia Reese, Mr. Trump mused that the house must be a valuable property because Mr. Carson had lived there. Ms. Manigault, who directs outreach efforts for the Trump campaign, told Ms. Reese that the campaign would send her a copy of Mr. Trump\u2019s book of business advice, \u201cThe Art of the Deal. \u201d It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will make a more sustained bid to attract black support. His campaign advisers have routinely announced changes in strategy, and promised adjustments to Mr. Trump\u2019s message and political style, only to have the candidate quickly lose interest and revert to form. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump followed up his surprise trip to Mexico City, where he expressed admiration for Mexican Americans, with an angry speech in Arizona denouncing illegal immigration and reiterating his pledge to wall off the southern border. But for Mr. Trump, winning the presidency might be all but impossible without a reversal of fortune with black and Hispanic voters. While Republicans usually lose those constituencies by a wide margin, polls suggest Mr. Trump is on track for such a historic rout that he may be unable to make up the difference with white voters. Mr. Jackson weathered some criticism for inviting Mr. Trump, and his own parishioners were split on Mr. Trump\u2019s visit, with several expressing support for Mr. Jackson\u2019s decision despite their own negative feelings about Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Candice Smith, 31, of Detroit, said she had been attending the church for 20 years and considered it a welcoming environment. \u201cWe accept anybody,\u201d said Ms. Smith, a cosmetologist. \u201cWe are kind of like an open church. Everybody is welcome to come. \u201d Jan Counts, 55, a computer designer, expressed skepticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions, and said it was too late for Mr. Trump to win his vote. \u201cI think he\u2019s using the church,\u201d said Mr. Counts, a congregant since 1993. \u201cYou can\u2019t just change everything that you have been saying before and say something else and want me to believe that. \u201d If Mr. Trump found himself in an atypical environment on Saturday, so, too, did his press corps. At many Trump rallies, supporters of the candidate often jeer at reporters, sometimes walking up to the enclosure for the traveling press to fling obscenities. On Saturday, a woman in the congregation approached the press corps in a different spirit. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she said, proceeding to hug each reporter in sight.'"}, "time": 1742562404.7242737}
