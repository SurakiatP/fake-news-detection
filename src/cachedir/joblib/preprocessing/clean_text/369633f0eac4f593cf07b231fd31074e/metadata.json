Flynn as national security adviser caps a remarkably tumultuous first month for President Trump\u2019s White House that has burdened the early days of his presidency with scandal, legal challenges, personnel drama and questions about his temperament during interactions with world leaders. Mr. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, lasted only 24 days before his tenure was cut short by an admission that he had misled the vice president and other White House colleagues about the contents of a phone call with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The resignation on Monday night and the continuing turmoil inside the National Security Council have deeply rattled the Washington establishment. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, railed against the administration on Tuesday, decrying the \u201cdysfunction\u201d of the country\u2019s national security apparatus and accusing the White House of being a place where \u201cnobody knows who\u2019s in charge and nobody knows who\u2019s setting policy. \u201d Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military\u2019s Special Operations Command, expressed concern about upheaval inside the White House. \u201cOur government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon because we\u2019re a nation at war,\u201d he said at a military conference on Tuesday. Asked about his comments later, General Thomas said in a brief interview, \u201cAs a commander, I\u2019m concerned our government be as stable as possible. \u201d But Mr. Flynn\u2019s   departure just added to the broader sense of chaos at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In record time, the 45th president has set off global outrage with a ban on travelers from   countries, fired his acting attorney general for refusing to defend the ban and watched as federal courts swiftly moved to block the policy, calling it an unconstitutional use of executive power. The president angrily provoked the cancellation of a summit meeting with the Mexican president, hung up on Australia\u2019s prime minister, authorized a commando raid that resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL member, repeatedly lied about the existence of millions of fraudulent votes cast in the 2016 election and engaged in Twitter wars with senators, a sports team owner, a Hollywood actor and a major department store chain. His words and actions have generated almost daily protests around the country. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so nervous in my lifetime about what may or may not happen in Washington,\u201d said Leon Panetta, a Democrat who served as chief of staff, secretary of defense and C. I. A. director during a   career that spanned nine presidents from both parties. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether this White House is capable of responding in a thoughtful or careful way should a crisis erupt,\u201d he said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cYou can do    stuff over a period of time. But at some point, I don\u2019t give a damn what your particular sense of change is all about, you cannot afford to have change become chaos. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s allies note that the president has moved forward in areas that are more typical of the early days of a   administration. Mr. Trump nominated a Supreme Court justice 12 days into his tenure, and has issued a dozen executive orders, including ones to limit the influence of lobbyists, reduce regulations, pare the Affordable Care Act, move forward on pipeline construction, end trade deals and speed up deportations. Those accomplishments are catnip for the president\u2019s most fervent supporters across the country, said Sara Fagen, who served as a senior aide and political director for former President George W. Bush. The perspective on the White House is very different far outside the interstate freeway that rings Washington, she said.\u2019 \u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re someone inside the Beltway, you think it\u2019s been really rocky,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are outside the Beltway, you think, \u2018That\u2019s why we sent him there.\u2019 There has been a lot of chaos and a lot of growing pains, but they have gotten a lot done. \u201d\u201d \u2019Still, half of the president\u2019s cabinet has yet to be confirmed by the   Senate, and several other key White House aides have become lightning rods for daily mockery by   comedians. It all has official Washington reeling and exhausted as it tries to make sense of  \u2014   and keep up with  \u2014   the nearly constant tornado of activity swirling around the president and his advisers. \u201cIf you had   Obama, you\u2019ve got      Trump,\u201d said John Feehery, a veteran Republican strategist, who compared the last several weeks to the chaotic start to Newt Gingrich\u2019s tenure as speaker of the House in 1995. \u201cNewt never settled down. It was always one crisis after another,\u201d Mr. Feehery recalled. \u201cThis might be the new normal. People will start getting used to the new normal, but will also be exhausted by it. \u201d As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised to move quickly to stop illegal immigration, bring jobs back, end trade deals and reduce crime. Central to his campaign agenda was his pledge to be a disruptive force in Washington  \u2014   and he has certainly done that. Since winning the election, Mr. Trump and his closest aides have embraced the turmoil, viewing it as evidence of their aggressive efforts to fundamentally reorient the government. The West Wing also uses the chaos as a tactical weapon, believing that the flurry of   presidential tweets, controversial statements during the afternoon briefing and surprise executive actions work to keep their adversaries, the media and others off balance. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, happily kept reporters waiting while he did \u201ca quick recap of the president\u2019s activity,\u201d proceeding to offer a long list of meetings and phone calls with foreign leaders, female entrepreneurs, local officials and educators. Yet the disruptions have come at a cost: the president has so far made little progress on legislation that would repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. The White House has not proposed a promised infrastructure bill to repair deteriorating roads, bridges and tunnels. And the president\u2019s aides have not yet drawn up plans for an overhaul of the nation\u2019s tax code. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty predictable,\u201d Mr. Feehery said. \u201cThis guy has never been in government before and he promised to be disruptive. \u201d It may also have consequences for Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to help Republicans win in the 2018 midterm elections. And Republican campaign experts acknowledge that his chances for winning   may hinge on his ability to contain the White House frenzy. \u201cYou are processing so much information in a day now. This stuff would have doomed anyone else, just one or two of them,\u201d said Thomas M. Davis, a former Republican member of Congress from Virginia. \u201cThey have got to produce something. If all you\u2019ve got is a bunch of executive orders and a Twitter feed, you don\u2019t want to go into an election like that. \u201d Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney during both of his presidential campaigns, said Mr. Trump\u2019s voters in 2016 wanted him to overhaul an establishment in Washington, which they view as long on promises, long on process but short on action. \u201cVoters certainly asked for change. They certainly wanted to see disruption,\u201d Mr. Madden said. \u201cBut if change begins to look like confusion and disruption morphs into disorder, you risk losing a certain level of confidence with voters. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564090.0554166}
