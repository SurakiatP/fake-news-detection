[Speaking at a party conference in Saarlouis, the chancellor called on Germans to show respect for other people\u2019s opinions, but said right wing groups opposed to mass migration have no right to \u201cexclude\u201d anyone from the benefit of belonging to the nation.  Putting a twist on \u201cWe are the people\u201d a chant popular with   movement PEGIDA, Merkel said \u201cAll of us, we are all the people\u201d. The chancellor, under whose rule German police have raided homes and made hundreds of arrests for online posts critical of mass migration, urged people to back values of \u2018freedom and democracy\u2019. Merkel said freedom of speech and religion, freedom of the press and freedom of travel are \u201cnot gifts that you don\u2019t have to work for\u201d. \u201cSometimes you have to make it clear that you are in favour of freedom\u201d she added, warning, \u201cI am convinced that we are again living in such a time\u201d. Looking ahead to the general election due to be held in Germany later this year, Merkel said the notion of  \u201cprosperity for all\u201d will be central to her campaign. \u201cWe want as many people as possible in Germany to be able to have a job with fair pay\u201d Merkel said, and underlined that companies should operate in such a way that they \u201cinvest in Germany and not elsewhere. \u201d Since the chancellor opened Germany\u2019s borders in 2015 to nearly two million migrants, most of whom are from the Middle East and Africa, the populist and Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany has eroded support for Merkel\u2019s   Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party. Public anger at the decision to house the influx of newcomers at taxpayers expense triggered a crackdown on \u2018hate speech\u2019 with the state using an organisation run by a former Stasi agent to patrol Facebook in  bid to stamp out \u201cxenophobic\u201d comments.'"}, "time": 1742628598.3080728}
