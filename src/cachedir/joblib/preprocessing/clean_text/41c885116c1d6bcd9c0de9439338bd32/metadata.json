What we have for a government today is more akin to an Oligarchy than a Constitutional Republic, this election was supposed to be between two of the Oligarchs, it didn\u2019t matter to the members of Club Oligarchy which Oligarch won the presidency, business would continue as usual, back room deals, insider trading, sharing in the prophets of the Military Industrial Complex, the Pharmaceutical Complex Etc. Etc. Etc. But alas a non Oligarch got the nomination, what to do before all is lost and we\u2019re exposed, ok fellow Oligarchs we\u2019ll get the media behind us they\u2019ll feed the \u201cUseful Idiots\u201d what we tell them to, this will work. Bush is a globalist, his father is a globalist, so are all the Democrats and RINOs. In my opinion JFK was the last Democrat president who loved his country, he almost died for it in WW2 and did die because he wouldn\u2019t go along with the shadow government. Ronald Reagan was the last Republican that loved his country, he too almost died because of it, the Shadow Government that controls this world I call Satan\u2019s Elite forces, they are in the process of setting up a world government by using Madmen from the Middle East to create Chaos. As a Christian I believe what the Prophet Daniel was told and that is the dark forces of Satan can get control of man\u2019s governments, this world government will come about, the good news it will be destroyed along with the evil people who created it. Interestingly one of the names of that man we call the Antichrist [The Scriptures do Not] can be translated as \u201cThe Man of Chaos\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563665.6289284}
