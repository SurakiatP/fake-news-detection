The Sausage Party star says he\u2019s \u201cbeen very conscious not to insult people who voted for Donald Trump,\u201d but believes it also important for him to normalize \u201cthe idea that a lot of people do not think that he is a good president, and do not think that he is bringing the country in a good direction, and not making it seem like some fringe,   thing that only really aggressive people who have whipped themselves into some sort of frenzy are expressing. \u201d Rogen added that \u201cas a white dude,\u201d he realizes that he\u2019s \u201cnot the one who\u2019s in real trouble right now. \u201d \u201cI find myself not even aligned with the left wing of American politics often, because in Canada, even that is pretty far right in many lines of thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not used to being thrilled with American politics in general. But I do think it\u2019s a lot better than most places better than a lot of other places I\u2019ve been. I\u2019m allowed to say and do things here that I couldn\u2019t in other places. \u201d Rogen has stepped up his criticism of the president in recent months. In February, he tweeted a message to Donald Trump Jr. asking his dad to resign from office before he \u201cdestroys the planet. \u201d Let\u2019s see if this works! pic. twitter.   \u2014   Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017,  On Twitter, the actor has also taken aim at the GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, and has criticized Trump\u2019s recent executive order on immigration. But Rogen says as someone who \u201cmostly just tries to observe a little bit,\u201d he can empathize with people who are both for and against Trump. \u201cI agree with the people who are very angry,\u201d Rogen said, \u201cand I also agree with the people who are like, \u2018We have to look for ways to not create more division, and to come together,\u2019 and I sympathize with the people who are like, \u2018F*ck that! This is ridiculous,\u2019 and I sympathize with the people who are like, \u2018F*ck that! That\u2019s never going to solve anything. \u2019\u201d However, the    says he won\u2019t be surprised \u201cif one day we\u2019re sitting at home watching a tape of Donald Trump jerking off while women piss on each other, if that\u2019s where all this ends, then that\u2019s just fantastic. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742563319.4439251}
