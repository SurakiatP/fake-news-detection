By Shepard Ambellas - November 4, 2016 ( INTELLIHUB ) \u2014 The U.S. Intelligence community has warned that al-Qaeda may attack three U.S. cities Monday, one day before the U.S. Presidential Election comes to a head. \\nSources believe that New York, Virginia and Texas may be threatened but are mentioning no specific locations. \\n\u201cThe counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety,\u201d the FBI told ABC News. \\nIf such a terror attack were to happen, keep in mind that President Barack Obama would likely use executive authority to remain in office after declaring a State of Emergency and suspending the elections. \\n#FalseFlag \\nShepard Ambellas is an opinion journalist, filmmaker , radio talk show host and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics.
