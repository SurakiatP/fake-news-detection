Tim Ryan, threatened a \u201cYoungstown street fight\u201d if Donald Trump attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. \\nSpeaking with Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, Ryan intimated that defunding Planned Parenthood wasn\u2019t the only stimulus he would need to launch violence. He stated, \u201cIf he tries to defund Planned Parenthood, if he tries to kick people off their health insurance, if they try to privatize Medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy, you know, we are going to have a Youngstown street fight in the Capitol.\u201d \\nYoungstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past; last May and August violence erupted on the streets of the city. \\nRyan called Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan \u201ca bunch of smoke and mirrors.\u201d He added that he didn\u2019t blame Pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues: \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience hang this election around Nancy Pelosi\u2019s neck, of course. But, moving forward, we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for Donald Trump, even in my district, where they voted for me and they voted for Donald Trump.\u201d \\nRyan\u2019s campaign to replace Pelsoi is picking up steam; on Sunday, New York Rep. Kathleen Rice endorsed him, stating, \"He has a lot of good ideas, but maybe most importantly, he also isn\u2019t suggesting he has all the answers \u2014 he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing, that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy,\" Rice said in a statement. \\nRice tweeted: Excited to announce my support for @RepTimRyan to serve as our next Democratic Leader.
