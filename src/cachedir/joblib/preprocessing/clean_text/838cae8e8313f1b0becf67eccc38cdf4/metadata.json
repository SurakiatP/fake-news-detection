Ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow live from the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily. [\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege to speak at CPAC for as long as I can remember,\u201d said Bolton. \u201cWhat I consistently try to talk about is the importance of a conservative foreign policy, through the vagaries of elections. The last eight years, I\u2019ve been able to describe what\u2019s wrong with Obama, which is very difficult in the time allotted for the main floor speeches. \u201d   \u201cThis year, obviously, I\u2019ll be following both Vice President Pence, who will be there tonight, and President Trump himself will be there tomorrow morning. So what I\u2019m going to try and do is lay out some of the principles I think we have to continue to operate on  \u2014   whatever people on the Hill say, whatever people in the executive branch say,\u201d he declared.  \u201cOne of the bedrock principles of conservatism  \u2014   and I think they start with the belief in American exceptionalism and the notion that our national security policy has to be based on American interests. I just think it\u2019s important to keep focused, and although I\u2019m not in the Trump administration, I will be doing whatever I can from the outside to try and keep their attention focused as the days go forward,\u201d he said. Marlow asked why a foreign policy that puts America first is so widely seen as a \u201crevolutionary idea. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s because the establishment doesn\u2019t see it that way,\u201d Bolton replied. \u201cYou can already, in the mainstream media commentary about the president\u2019s emerging team and the direction he\u2019s going in, some of the themes that show how the press, the mainstream press in Washington, tries to manipulate new Republican administrations. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re filled with commentary about how wonderful it is that many of the president\u2019s appointments are   and technocratic and perhaps most important of all, not controversial  \u2014   meaning that the New York Times and the Washington Post are prepared to give him a pass,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cLook, it\u2019s very early days, and this is not necessarily a reflection of the truth about these individuals. It\u2019s a reflection of how the Washington echo chamber is trying to mold them, to get them to seek the approval of their   betters who write editorials on the pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post. \u201d \u201cIf they can avoid succumbing to that siren song, they\u2019ll do fine,\u201d he advised. \u201cBut what the media and the Democrats are trying to do now is convince them: \u2018You don\u2019t want to be controversial. You don\u2019t want to be ideological. Things are just fine. Be a technocrat. Tinker around the edges. Don\u2019t change much.\u2019 That\u2019s not what Donald Trump got elected to do. That\u2019s the fight really on the national security front, I think, for the soul of the administration. \u201d Marlow confessed he had been quietly rooting for Bolton to become national security adviser, prompting Bolton to humorously observe that he might have gotten the job if Marlow had only been less quiet about supporting him.  \u201cWhat do you think of McMaster?\u201d Marlow asked, referring to General H. R. McMaster, who was named national security adviser this week. \u201cHis book, Dereliction of Duty, is something, really, that anybody concerned about either the Vietnam war or   relations in the United States ought to read. It\u2019s absolutely \u201d Bolton replied. \u201cI think he\u2019s demonstrated that he\u2019s a man of great personal courage, and he\u2019s an original thinker. I hope that he\u2019ll be able to demonstrate those qualities. You know, it\u2019s an uphill struggle when you\u2019re still on active duty, which he is. I wish him all the best. I hope he does well. I\u2019m happy to help out, whatever way I can, from the outside. \u201d  \u201cLet\u2019s hope he can help coordinate the various departments and agencies that do national security. It sounds kind of boring and bureaucratic, but I tell you, it can be fatal to an administration  \u2014   again, especially a Republican administration  \u2014   if it doesn\u2019t speak with one voice,\u201d Bolton said. John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and presides over his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.
