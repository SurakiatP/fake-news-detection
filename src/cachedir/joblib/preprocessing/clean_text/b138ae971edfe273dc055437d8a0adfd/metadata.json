The special envoy also criticized the \u201cuse of heavy airpower on civilian areas.\u201d \\n\u201cThe civilians of both sides of Aleppo have suffered enough due to futile but lethal attempts of subduing the city of Aleppo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey now need and deserve a stable ceasefire covering this ancient city of Syria.\u201d \\nEarlier on Sunday, state news agency SANA reported that \u201cshells containing poison gases\u201d had been fired at the residential district of al-Hamdaniya in western, government-held Aleppo. \\nRT Arabic\u2019s crew in Aleppo reported 36 cases of suffocation. Al-Mayadeen reported that all the victims of the attack are civilians. \\nJust recently, the Russian Defense Ministry reported on a number of attacks in Aleppo that targeted schools and claimed the lives of at least three children in the period of 24 hours. Twelve more people died in an attack on a humanitarian aid corridor opened next to a school in the Al-Mashariq district, according to the ministry\u2019s information. Twelve more people were injured. \\nMeanwhile, according to Russia\u2019s Permanent Mission to the United Nations, over 16,000 people have fallen victim to opposition groups meant to be under US control. \u201cFrom February to September, the opposition groups that are supposed to be under the US control committed 2,031 violations of the [cessation of hostilities], which claimed lives of 3,532 military personnel and 12,800 civilians,\u201d the Mission\u2019s statement, published on the website of the Russian Foreign Ministry, reads. \\nAccording to Dr. Said Sadek, professor of Political Sociology at the American University of Cairo, it\u2019s not likely that Western powers and the Gulf states will end their backing for rebel groups, even if they are found responsible for using chemical weapons in Aleppo. \u201cWe have to understand that for six years, the Western countries and the Gulf states invested in those \u2018moderate\u2019 or radical groups, and so they cannot abandon them,\u201d Sadek explained. \u201cThey cannot pull out now and say, \u2018OK we discovered that we are wrong, let\u2019s get out and leave them.\u2019 They have invested in them and they will still use them for bargaining in the future of Syria.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562304.2563555}
