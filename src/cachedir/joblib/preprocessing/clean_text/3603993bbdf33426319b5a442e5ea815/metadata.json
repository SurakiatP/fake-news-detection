The caller, an   woman, \u201cin a loud screaming voice kept saying there\u2019s a bomb,\u201d said Barry A. Abels, the center\u2019s executive director. At roughly the same time, a woman dialed the Jewish community center in Rockville, Md. nearly 500 miles away, and said there was a bomb. Not long after, a man called a Jewish organization in Wilmington, Del. He, too, warned of a bomb. Similar threats, which turned out to be unfounded, were reported all over the Eastern United States on Monday, at as many as 16 Jewish community facilities, one advocacy group estimated. Time and time again, the police responded, buildings were evacuated and, after tense waits, the centers and schools reopened. Federal law enforcement officials did not definitively link the threats, but the episodes rattled nerves, and raised deep concern and little doubt that the phone calls had been orchestrated. \u201cMy personal take is it\u2019s a statement of where we are in this country,\u201d said Michael Feinstein, the chief executive of the Bender Jewish Community Center of Greater Washington, in Rockville. \u201cThere\u2019s some thought amongst some people that hate speech and hate crimes are O. K. and   is O. K. and I think that is reflective of sort of the political discourse that we\u2019ve had in this country. \u201d Mr. Feinstein said about 300 people had been in the Rockville center when the threat was made, including about 200 preschoolers. After the threat in Delaware, parents were called to pick up preschool and day school students. In South Carolina, Mr. Abels said staff members and patrons attending exercise classes had to leave. About three hours later, he said, the authorities said it was safe to return, leaving many to wonder what had happened. \u201cIt could be anything from hate groups to a terrorist situation,\u201d Mr. Abels said. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably more on the hate group side, because it was just a scare. \u201d He said he believed it was \u201cdesigned to be psychologically disorienting and scary and just disruptive. \u201d Jerry Silverman, the president and chief executive of the Jewish Federations of North America, said the threats were part of a disturbing trend toward normalizing hate speech. It was less than three years ago that a former Ku Klux Klan leader killed three people outside Jewish facilities in Overland Park, Kan. And in November, after the presidential election, the   League posted a warning about a reported uptick in hate speech and  . Some members of the   a   fringe movement that embraces elements of   racist and   positions, perceived the victory of   Donald J. Trump as validation for their cause and have become increasingly visible in recent months. Mr. Trump, who has a Jewish daughter and    has disavowed the  . Mr. Silverman said Monday\u2019s cases were part of a broader \u201ccoordinated effort\u201d to intimidate Jews. He said that Jewish organizations nationwide had instituted emergency protocols, and that leaders were communicating with one another on Monday as the threats were reported. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this at Jewish community centers over the last year,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it at Jewish day schools. We\u2019ve seen it at synagogues. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all about training and preparedness,\u201d he added. Law enforcement agencies in Nashville Jacksonville, Fla. and Tenafly, N. J. were among those confirming on Monday that they had responded to and cleared bomb threats at Jewish centers. An F. B. I. spokeswoman said the bureau was \u201caware of bomb threats\u201d and had been in touch with the local police. \u201cWe understand there were similar threats around the country,\u201d said Tzipora Cohen, of the Jewish Community Center in Tenafly. \u201cI guess these are the times we live in. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628406.2452195}
