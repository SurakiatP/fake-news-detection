Gawker said it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and would conduct a sale through an auction. The company is under significant financial pressure from a $140 million legal judgment in an    lawsuit by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan and facing a determined foe in the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who is funding legal cases against it. Ziff Davis, a digital media company, has submitted an opening bid, which a person briefed on Gawker\u2019s plans said was in the range of $90 million to $100 million. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sale process. Gawker expects a sale to close by the end of the summer. But even as Gawker took stock of its next steps, it remained, in typical fashion, defiant. \u201cEven with his billions, Thiel will not silence our writers,\u201d Nick Denton, Gawker\u2019s founder and chief executive, said on Twitter. \u201cOur sites will thrive  \u2014   under new ownership  \u2014   and we\u2019ll win in court. \u201d (Mr. Denton, through a spokesman, declined further comment.) Since its founding in 2002, Gawker has espoused a conversational tone that came to be mimicked across the internet and on social platforms like Twitter. Gawker and its affiliated sites  \u2014   including the   Deadspin and Jezebel, which is aimed at women  \u2014   have relentlessly and gleefully chronicled the lives of the powerful, and often delivered   exclusive stories, some of them too    for other publications. The company was also an incubator of talent: Employees went on to found websites like The Awl and work at publications like The New Yorker and Time. Gawker also had many detractors, who said it often went too far and published items with little news value that aimed to embarrass individuals. But over the last year Gawker. com has been going through something of a cultural transformation. Mr. Denton has vowed to make the site nicer and Gawker has shifted to politics and away from coverage of the New York media world and celebrity gossip. The decision to file for bankruptcy and put itself up for sale is the latest development for a company that has faced a seemingly unending barrage of bad news in the last year. There was the maelstrom last summer after Gawker published, and then removed, an article about a married male media executive who sought to hire a gay escort. That decision led to the resignations of two top editors. More recently, there was the lawsuit by Mr. Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, which has roiled the company and raised questions about its path forward. \u201cIt really was an incredibly bad year,\u201d said Hamilton Nolan, a writer who has worked at Gawker for eight years. \u201cI think they\u2019ll study this in journalism schools one day as being the single worst year in media company history. \u201d In Gawker\u2019s new offices in Manhattan on Friday, the mood was somber. Around noon, Mr. Denton and Heather Dietrick, the company\u2019s president and general counsel, held a meeting to inform employees of the company\u2019s plans and provide reassurance that Gawker would operate as usual during the sale process. \u201cThey emphasized that the future is uncertain, but for now we\u2019re going to keep doing what we do, and that was useful for people to hear,\u201d said Alex Pareene, the editor in chief of Gawker. Employees said that few people had known before the meeting of the company\u2019s decision to file for bankruptcy. A keg of beer was brought in and pizzas were ordered. \u201cIt was not a raucous or even particularly depressing affair,\u201d Mr. Pareene said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more depressing meetings and we\u2019ve had more argumentative meetings. \u201d Gawker\u2019s sites published posts assuring readers they were not going anywhere. Filing for Chapter 11 stays claims from creditors, including court judgments  \u2014   meaning Gawker will not need to begin paying the $140 million that was awarded in March to Mr. Bollea. It also allows companies more time and more control as they reorganize themselves. In its bankruptcy filing, Gawker listed $50 million to $100 million in assets and $100 million to $500 million in liabilities. The company still plans to appeal the case. Also on Friday, a judge in Pinellas County Circuit Court in Florida granted Gawker\u2019s request for a stay of the judgment against it in the lawsuit, pending an appeal. That decision essentially became redundant once Gawker filed for bankruptcy. Weeks earlier, Mr. Thiel acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times that he was financially supporting Mr. Bollea\u2019s lawsuit, as well as other lawsuits against the organization. Mr. Thiel, a founder of PayPal and one of the earliest investors in Facebook, was outed as being gay by one of Gawker\u2019s blogs, the   Valleywag, nearly a decade ago. He said that Gawker published articles that \u201cruined people\u2019s lives for no reason\u201d and prompted his decision to finance cases against the company. \u201cIt\u2019s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,\u201d Mr. Thiel said of his supporting Gawker\u2019s legal opponents. \u201cI saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest. \u201d A spokesman for Mr. Thiel did not return a request for comment on Friday. Gawker is also exploring at least one lawsuit against Mr. Thiel, according to the person briefed on Gawker\u2019s plans. The offer by Ziff Davis, whose online properties include IGN, Geek. com and AskMen. com, is what is known as a \u201c  bid,\u201d essentially setting a floor in a   auction. Money from a sale would be held aside to cover creditor claims, including any damages after the appeals process. In an internal memo obtained by The New York Times, Ziff Davis\u2019s chief executive, Vivek Shah, said that under the terms of a potential agreement, the company would acquire Gawker Media\u2019s properties but none of its liabilities. When discussing its plans for Gawker Media, he referred to the benefits of having all of the company\u2019s sites, but conspicuously omitted any mention of Gawker. com. He said the auction would most likely take place at the end of July. Other bidders, which will probably include other media publishers, are expected, particularly with the threat of assuming legal claims removed with the bankruptcy filing. In January, Gawker sold a minority stake in the company to the investment company Columbus Nova Technology Partners, partly in preparation for the lawsuit by Mr. Bollea. Mr. Bollea sued Gawker Media in 2012 over Gawker. com\u2019s publication of a    tape that showed Mr. Bollea having sex with a woman who was at the time the wife of a friend of his. In March, after a   trial, a Florida jury awarded $115 million in damages to Mr. Bollea. A jury later awarded $25 million more in punitive damages, bringing the total to $140 million. On Friday, some Gawker employees remained hopeful that a new owner might mean a fresh start, but there was also perhaps a tacit acknowledgment that Gawker as everyone knew it could soon be a thing of the past. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be the magical happy ending to the story,\u201d Mr. Nolan said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s going to be the worst ending to the story, but we\u2019re not just going to go back to everything being how it was. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564300.7846587}
