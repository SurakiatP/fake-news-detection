[Breitbart News asked Spicer during the White House press briefing if President Donald Trump planned to leave Obamacare in place and move onto other issues if the House bill failed.  Spicer denied the premise. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to leave it in place because we\u2019re going to repeal and replace it tomorrow, move it through the Senate, and the president will sign the bill,\u201d he said. Spicer pointed out that conservatives like Rep. Steve King now support the bill, as well as Rep. Lou Barletta. \u201cWe continue to see the enthusiasm and momentum coming to our direction,\u201d Spicer insisted, despite 25 House Freedom Caucus conservatives reasserting their decision to vote against the bill. The bill needs 216 votes to pass and, as Democrats remain unanimously opposed to the House legislation, only 21 Republicans can vote against the bill or it fails. In recent days, Trump signaled he is eager to get health care done so he can move on to other issues like trade and tax reform. But the White House denied that there was any consideration of an \u201cOption B\u201d on health care if the first plan failed. \u201cThis is the only train leaving the station,\u201d Spicer said.'"}, "time": 1742564030.2966185}
