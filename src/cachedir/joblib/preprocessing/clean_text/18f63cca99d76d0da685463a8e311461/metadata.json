Sharpe noted how it \u201cbothers\u201d him black players act up for black head coaches when black head coaches are so sparse in the league, but added that black head coaches are held more accountable for their players\u2019 actions than white head coaches. \u201cIt bothers me that people of color act like this when they have other people of color [as] head coaches,\u201d Sharpe stated. \u201cYou see the way he acts for [Bengals head coach] Marvin Lewis. It\u2019s so hard for blacks to get head coaching jobs. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying just because you play for a black coach, I\u2019m not saying you should act any different but you damn sure shouldn\u2019t act worse. And it bothers me that Marvin Lewis has to deal with this because this gets placed at his feet,\u201d he continued. Sharpe went on to say black head coaches get criticized for how their players act on and off the field, while some of their white counterparts do not. \u201cThese guys, they hold black coaches so accountable for the actions of their team and some of the other white counterparts, they don\u2019t get that same criticism when their players act up,\u201d he concluded.
