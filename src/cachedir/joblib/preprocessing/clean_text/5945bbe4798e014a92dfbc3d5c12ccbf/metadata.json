I mean, if you remember this March 23rd date, where this kind of blew up, that was not any deadline. That was a   deadline. And what happened was, the bill really wasn\u2019t ready for primetime. You hadn\u2019t developed a consensus. You set a date to vote on it without having the consensus. And so, what\u2019s happened since then, is members are talking to each other, and really the administration, I think has done a good job. Vice President Pence has been exercising a lot of leadership to try to figure out how do we actually fulfill the promises we made to the American people, and for me the core thing that we have to do is deliver lower premiums and more choice on private insurance, because that is the reason why people dislike Obamacare because their premiums have gone up and their deductibles have gone up. So, that\u2019s really what we have to do, and I think if we can get there, I absolutely think we can pass something, relatively soon. \u201d DeSantis added that he thinks the House is getting closer to an Obamacare bill.
