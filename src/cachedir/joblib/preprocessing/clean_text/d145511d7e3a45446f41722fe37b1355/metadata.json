In a letter to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday, the same day Turkey announced a rapprochement with Israel, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed regret about the November episode, in which Turkish forces shot down a Russian warplane that Turkey said had violated its airspace. The downing infuriated Russia and paralyzed relations between the two countries: The Kremlin ordered sanctions on Turkish food imports, stopped   travel for Turks and barred Turkish tour operators from offering Russian tourists vacation packages. Mr. Erdogan has become isolated diplomatically after adopting an increasingly authoritarian stand, a combative position with Europe regarding the international migrant crisis, and a newly muscular foreign policy, including a failed strategy in Syria. The outreach on Monday can be viewed as an effort to repair some of that damage. \u201cTurkey had been going through a deep sense of isolation for the past few years, having switched from its famous \u2018zero problems with neighbors\u2019 policy to a place where they had no neighbors without problems,\u201d said Asli Aydintasbas, an expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThis was the loneliest point in the history of the republic  \u2014   Qatar and Saudi Arabia looking like the government\u2019s only real friends. \u201d Under Mr. Erdogan, Turkey has tried to establish friendships with its Muslim neighbors, a shift from the past. But some experts argue that Turkey miscalculated, especially in Syria, where, until recently, it pushed for the ouster of President Bashar  . It has also opposed the United States there over Kurdish rebels fighting the Islamic State, and has been criticized for letting fighters pass freely across its border with Syria. In the case of Russia, economics trumped political posturing, Ms. Aydintasbas said. Trade between the two countries had been substantially in Russia\u2019s favor, largely because it sells considerable amounts of oil and gas to Turkey. But Turkey also benefited: More than three million Russians visit each year, the   group of foreign travelers after Germans, and their absence has taken a painful toll on Turkey\u2019s tourism industry. In his letter to Mr. Putin, Mr. Erdogan said he \u201cwould like to inform the family of the deceased Russian pilot that I share their pain and to offer my condolences to them,\u201d according to a statement from Turkey\u2019s presidential spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin. The effort to repair relations with Russia began the same day that Turkey and Israel announced an agreement to resume full diplomatic relations, ending a bitter   rift between the   regional allies. The two countries had fallen out over a 2010 Israeli military raid on a Turkish boat, the Mavi Marmara, which was bringing aid to Gaza. Ten Turkish activists were killed. The deal provided an opening for lucrative natural gas projects: for Israel to sell natural gas reserves to Turkey, and via Turkey to Europe. Louis Fishman, an assistant professor at Brooklyn College who specializes in   affairs, said that, for Turkey, the resumption of relations was \u201cnot merely about cutting a natural gas deal with Israel, which certainly tops its agenda, but also an attempt to regain regional clout. \u201d Turkey also announced on Monday that it would prosecute a Turkish man suspected of killing the pilot of the Russian jet after his plane was shot down in November, Reuters reported. Russia had been demanding the prosecution of the man, Alparslan Celik, who was fighting in northern Syria at the time. It is unclear why the reconciliation with Russia is happening now. Mr. Erdogan, a charismatic leader who has tapped into rising populism in Turkey, has grown increasingly autocratic, prompting criticism from liberals at home and from some allies abroad. Experts said he was trying to change his positions abroad in order to burnish his image and authority. \u201cAt the core of the decision to mend ties with Israel and Russia is an existential need for survival,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas said. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party is \u201cthe top   and has just won elections,\u201d she said, \u201cbut with a serious homegrown insurgency, a frail economy and a long list of foes, it is hard to rule a country. \u201d Cengiz Candar, a visiting scholar at the Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies, said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the contours of Erdogan\u2019s pragmatism. Now they can say: \u2018See, we are improving our relations in our neighborhood. We\u2019re on the right track.\u2019 \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561877.245114}
