They were also about to unleash the modern concept of television buzz, in a storm the likes of which the medium had not seen. They were the Smothers Brothers, Tom and Dick, and the    story of their show, \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\u201d is worth recalling 50 years on as a case study that may prove newly relevant as a president with a habit of attacking TV shows via Twitter settles into office. That first episode, taped in late January and broadcast Feb. 5, 1967, wasn\u2019t incendiary, but some that came later were spectacularly so. The brothers inflamed CBS censors and segments of their audience by injecting sexual innuendo, drug references, religion and especially politics into the typically bland   format, drawing, in Season 3, a   firing. The story of the show can seem  . The brothers were delivering two things that every network today covets: a lot of attention and a young audience. Why kill that    goose? The answer lies in the newness of it all. In 1967, no one knew quite how to exploit controversy and   conversation the way   publicists do. The series was CBS\u2019s latest effort to compete against \u201cBonanza,\u201d the NBC staple that had owned Sunday nights for years. The brothers had a     stage act in which Tom, on guitar, played a dimwit, and Dick, on bass, was the straight man. The dynamic translated exceedingly well to TV. Dick Smothers, now 77, who lives in Florida and advocates fitness and balance programs for older people, was a bit surprised by the show\u2019s popularity at first. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we sang that well,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I can see the genuineness, the whimsy that we had. \u201d The series was remarkable for its   approach, mixing established guest stars with newcomers and rock acts. A September 1967 installment had Bette Davis, Mickey Rooney and the Who, whose   finale that night is said to have damaged Pete Townshend\u2019s hearing. The multigenerational lineups led to ratings success some weeks, the show even outdrew \u201cBonanza. \u201d But the humor content increasingly reflected contentious times, and by Season 2, clashes with CBS\u2019s censors were frequent. \u201cThey had something to offend everybody,\u201d William H. Tankersley, then the executive in charge of programming standards and practices at CBS, said in a 2001 interview with the Archive of American Television, still sounding peeved. (Mr. Tankersley died last year at 98.) \u201cThey brought more complaints than any show in history on CBS. They injected politics up to the sky. They refused to do anything that we asked. \u201d The CBS response, though, was oddly inconsistent, evidence of how uncharted this territory was. Pete Seeger\u2019s performance of the antiwar \u201cWaist Deep in the Big Muddy\u201d was cut out of his performance in an early Season 2 episode, but five months later he was allowed to sing the song. What today seems barely saucy would be cut. One early battle involved efforts to say \u201cfrigget\u201d instead of \u201cribbet\u201d in a frog sketch, David Bianculli recounts in \u201cDangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. \u201d A sort of guerrilla war broke out in which banned material would turn up in newspapers, including this one as early as April 1967, The New York Times reprinted a sketch by Elaine May that the network had killed. Yet some of the material that made it onto the air was pointed enough to raise eyebrows even today. A series of sketches in a December 1967 episode, for instance, mocked the American obsession with guns mercilessly. In one bit, a   contestant was to take shots at three hidden figures in hopes of killing either a stranger, a celebrity or his own wife. If the network was surprised by the show\u2019s success and all the controversy, people on the creative side of things were, too. \u201cI was na\u00efve enough to think that nobody was watching except my friends,\u201d said David Steinberg, who was then a   comedian who had made a few \u201cTonight Show\u201d appearances. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that we were bothering the government. \u201d In Season 3, Mr. Steinberg did one of his satirical \u201csermonettes,\u201d in which he tweaked religion, a subject that television of the day didn\u2019t like to touch. Some time after that appearance, he said, he dropped by the show\u2019s headquarters and Tom Smothers dragged him to a room that contained a bunch of bulging duffel bags. \u201cI said, \u2018What is this? \u2019\u201d Mr. Steinberg recalled. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018It\u2019s your hate mail. \u2019\u201d In March 1969, Tom Smothers asked Mr. Steinberg to do another sermonette, although the network had banned the bit. That move is often credited with being the last straw, though it was just one of many, many straws. In any case, the network fired the Smotherses and canceled the show, though it was still pulling in decent ratings. Since those times, networks have learned that a certain amount of boundary pushing is healthy politicians have become more adept at manipulating TV and the people on the creative side have begun to understand that being on TV, especially in network prime time, requires compromises. That learning process continues today just ask Keith Olbermann or Bill Maher,   hosts whose mouths have landed them in hot water. Yet     content, the thing that got the Smothers Brothers in trouble, is all over prime time, even on comedies like \u201c . \u201d And now comes Donald J. Trump, who seems to have thin skin. The Smotherses incurred the wrath of two presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. Tom Smothers, who turns 80 in February, said in an interview in 2000 that he had always believed Nixon was directly responsible for his show\u2019s demise. \u201cThere was a bigger game going on that was beyond our scope of understanding,\u201d he said. Who knows what games lie ahead as a Twitter president takes office?'"}, "time": 1742563203.705846}
