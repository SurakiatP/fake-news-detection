Obama\u2019s DOJ is REFUSING to access a warrant that would allow FBI officials to read any of the newly discovered Abedin emails. They are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen. \\nFrom Liberty Writers : \u201cWE DO NOT HAVE A WARRANT,\u201d A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL SAID. \u201cDISCUSSIONS ARE UNDER WAY [BETWEEN THE FBI AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT] AS TO THE BEST WAY TO MOVE FORWARD.\u201d Obama\u2019s Justice Dept. is stonewalling Comey\u2019s entire FBI investigation because they know the findings will put an end to Hilllary Clinton\u2019s political career. Comey already upset Loretta Lynch and the DOJ by reopening the investigation in the first place. Top Justice Department officials \u201cstrongly discouraged\u201d Comey from continuing the investigation because of the election. A U.S official familiar with the matter said \u201c He was acting independently of the guidance given to him.\u201d Comey insisted in his message to agents that he felt he had an obligation to inform Congress about the new material and it would be \u201cmisleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.\u201d This new attempt to block the investigation seems like a way to punish Comey for putting the American people before politics. We the people have a RIGHT to see those emails! The American people are at WAR with their government right now. KEEP FIGHTING! This is a movement \u2013 we are the political OUTSIDERS fighting against the FAILED GLOBAL ESTABLISHMENT! Join the resistance and help us fight to put America First!
