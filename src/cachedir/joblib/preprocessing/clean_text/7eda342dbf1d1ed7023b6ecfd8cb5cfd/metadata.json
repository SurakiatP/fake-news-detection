[Published just hours after the terrorist attack outside Finsbury Park mosque, the BBC\u2019s article is hosted on their CBBC (Children\u2019s BBC) website. It begins: \u201cFollowing recent events in the news you might have been hearing a lot about Islam and maybe the term \u2018Islamophobia\u2019  \u2014   but what does this mean?\u201d  It states: Islam is over 1, 400 years old, dating back to the 7th Century. The Islamic word for God is Allah. The word \u201cIslam\u201d comes from an old Arabic word meaning \u201cpeace. \u201d UPDATE 21 June 2017: Following the publication of this article, the BBC has changed its copy to state: Islam is over 1, 400 years old, dating back to the 7th Century. The Islamic word for God is Allah. The word \u201cIslam\u201d means submission to God\u2019s will and obedience to God\u2019s law. It comes from an old Arabic word meaning \u201cpeace. \u201d In reality, the word \u201cIslam\u201d actually means \u201csubmission\u201d implying submission to Allah. There has been a broader discussion on the matter in recent years, but while \u201cSalam\u201d means welcome or peace, the root of the word Islam is grounded in the idea of submission to Allah. This has been confirmed by a number of Quranic scholars, as well as Muslims on the Ummah Forum website. One writes: \u201ci would sum it up as, islam means submission, one who submits is a muslim, and submission to Allah will bring peace to your heart insha Allah. \u201d Even Britain\u2019s most notorious Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary concurred, in an interview with CBN: \u201cYou can\u2019t say that Islam is a religion of peace,\u201d Choudary told CBN News. \u201cBecause Islam does not mean peace. Islam means submission. So the Muslim is one who submits. There is a place for violence in Islam. There is a place for jihad in Islam. \u201d CBBC adds, with no evidence: \u201c  \u2026    many people say those terrorist groups have extreme beliefs of hatred and violence that have little to do with what most Muslims believe. \u201d In reality, vast numbers of Muslims, even in the Western world, hold   views and ideals that fit well with the modus operandi of terrorist groups. While indeed there is some   discrimination all around the world,   and Muslim Brotherhood affiliated groups created and seized upon the word Islamophobia in order to promote the ideas of fitna and fasad: effectively the idea of standing in the way of the spread of Islam. Quran 2:191 commands: \u201cAnd kill [the unbelievers] wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it, but if they do fight you, then slay them such is the recompense of the unbelievers. \u201d Quran 5:32 says: \u201cIndeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment. \u201d Following the London Bridge terrorist attack, CBBC wrote: A white van hit pedestrians on London Bridge at about 10pm on Saturday, then three men got out and attacked people in nearby Borough Market. Police arrived within a few minutes and the three men believed to be responsible for the attack were killed by the specially trained police. Dozens of emergency service workers were sent to the scene and the injured were taken to five London hospitals to be treated. Police investigations into what happened are continuing. A group called Islamic State has said it was behind the attack, but police haven\u2019t confirmed if that is true. Under an article entitled \u201cWhat is the Islamic State?\u201d the BBC\u2019s children\u2019s website says: \u201cIS are a group based in the Middle East, mainly in Iraq and Syria, who have extreme religious beliefs. They use brutal violence against anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with their views. \u201cThey claim to follow the religion of Islam, but many people say their beliefs of hatred and violence have little to do with what the majority of Muslims believe. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563282.9032397}
