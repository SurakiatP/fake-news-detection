[In her work, \u201cUnhappy Confessions: The Temptation of Admitting to White Privilege,\u201d recent Emory graduate and Elon University scholar Claire Lockard argues that acknowledgments of white privilege or racism are \u201cpleasurable to enact but ultimately reinforce white people\u2019s feelings of goodness and allow them to avoid addressing this racism. \u201d  In the abstract for her work, Lockard explains how an admission of white privilege could lead to a complacency that leads individuals away from   activism. I argue that because such admissions are conscious attempts to address unconscious habits, they are unhappy speech acts and contrary to their implied aims. Admissions of white privilege or racism can be conceptualized as Foucauldian confessions that are pleasurable to enact but ultimately reinforce white people\u2019s feelings of goodness and allow them to avoid addressing this racism. I ground my argument in Shannon Sullivan\u2019s analysis of white privilege and Sara Ahmed\u2019s critique of confessions of   to show that in addition to doing no   work at the moment of saying, these confessions actually reify white privilege deeper into the unconscious and make it harder to address. Lockard, whose Twitter account has now been set to private, tweeted on March 1 that she frequently would interrupt white students in her courses to encourage minority students to speak up: \u201cNew favorite thing: interrupting white dudes in my classes to say \u2018I think some other folks want to join the conversation. \u2019\u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.
