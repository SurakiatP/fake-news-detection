According to the latest figures from the United States Drought Monitor, about 17 percent of the state remains under \u201cmoderate drought\u201d conditions or worse. This time last year, it was about 95 percent. But not everyone is rejoicing. On Catalina Island, just off the Southern California coast, water scarcity is so severe that residents still rely almost entirely on a pair of desalination plants. Catalina is home to population of 4, 000 or so people and a beach playground for roughly a million annual visitors. Residents and businesses have had to contend with mandatory water rationing since 2013. Surrounded by ocean, the island has a major disadvantage to the rest of California: It can\u2019t tap the melting Sierra Nevada snow that sustains mainland farms and cities during the warm months. That\u2019s why officials have tightly restricted the use of Catalina\u2019s main water source: an aquifer connected to the interior Middle Ranch Reservoir. The drumbeat of winter storms has helped to replenish the reservoir, but as of last week it was still only roughly a quarter full  \u2014   and summer is looming. Alex Krowiak, a photographer and marine science educator who lives on Catalina, published a photo essay on the island\u2019s water problems in News Deeply this month. He shared some of his pictures with us: (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) \u2022 A day after 14, 000 people were ordered to flee rising floodwaters in San Jose, the mayor acknowledged that the city had been ill prepared.

[Capitol Weekly] \u2022 The perfect day trip from Los Angeles: the   Channel Islands. [The New York Times] Last week, the State Senate leader, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, quietly introduced legislation that would require California to get all of its electricity from solar, wind and other renewable sources by 2045. The proposal significantly raises the bar set in 2015 when Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that aims for 50 percent use of renewables by 2030. We asked a few energy experts for their reactions to the plan. \u2022 Is the timeline plausible? It\u2019s \u201cambitious,\u201d said Felix Mormann, a faculty fellow at Stanford\u2019s Steyer \u2014  Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance. \u201cBut not implausible. \u201d \u201cLast year, Germany was able to briefly meet 95 percent of the country\u2019s electricity demand with renewables,\u201d Mr. Mormann said. \u201cBut such peak events are still a long way from weaning an entire energy economy off all nonrenewable energy on a permanent basis. \u201d \u2022 What are the biggest challenges? Cost is one, said Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at U. C. Berkeley\u2019s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment. \u201cPrices are coming down in all these technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we wouldn\u2019t know how much it would cost. We also presumably would have to retire some existing power plants, so the ratepayer impacts are unknown. \u201d Another challenge is energy storage. A total reliance on renewable energy would require a major expansion of storage capacity for those times when the wind dies down and the sun fades, said Sadrul Ula, managing director of U. C. Riverside\u2019s Winston Chung Global Energy Center. \u201cLithium batteries offer good potential,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re still not there. \u201d \u2022 Is Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s legislation encouraging?  Yes, said Dr. Ula, because it would essentially set the table for innovation. \u201cWithout that, we don\u2019t discuss it. We don\u2019t have a target,\u201d he added. \u201cResources and development don\u2019t get channeled unless there is a goal post. \u201d Want to submit a photo for possible publication?
