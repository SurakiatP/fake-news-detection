Whitehead \\n\u201cThe people have the power, all we have to do is awaken that power in the people. The people are unaware. They\u2019re not educated to realize that they have power. The system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything. We are the government .\u201d\u2014John Lennon \\nHow do you balance the scales of justice at a time when Americans are being Tasered, tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed, hit with batons, shot with rubber bullets and real bullets, blasted with sound cannons, detained in cages and kennels , sicced by police dogs, arrested and jailed for challenging the government\u2019s excesses, abuses and power-grabs? \\nPolitics won\u2019t fix a system that is broken beyond repair. \\nNo matter who sits in the White House, the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes. \\nRelying on the courts to restore justice seems futile. \\nIndeed, with every ruling handed down, it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice, with government courts, largely lacking in vision and scope, rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law. This is true at all levels of the judiciary, but especially so in the highest court of the land, the U.S. Supreme Court, which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution. \\nEven s \\nIt doesn\u2019t matter who the activists are (environmentalists, peaceniks, Native Americans, Black Lives Matter, Occupy, or the Bundys and their followers) or what the source of the discontent is (endless wars abroad, police shootings, contaminated drinking water, government land-grabs), the government\u2019s modus operandi \\nJust recently, in fact, an Oregon jury rejected the government\u2019s attempts to prosecute seven activists \\nIn finding the defendants not guilty\u2014of conspiracy to impede federal officers, of possession of firearms in a federal facility, a \\nThe Malheur occupiers were found not guilty despite the fact that they had guns in a federal facility (their lawyers argued the guns were \u201cas much a statement of their rural culture as a cowboy hat or a pair of jeans\u201d). They were found not guilty despite the fact that they used government vehicles (although they would argue that government property is public property available to all taxpayers). They were found not guilty despite the fact that they succeeded in occupying a government facility for six weeks, thereby preventing workers from performing their duties (as the Washington Post points out, this charge has also been used to prosecute extremist left-wingers and Earth First protesters \\nAs law professor Ilya Somin explains, jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the \u201claw in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive .\u201d According to former federal prosecutor Paul Butler, the doctrine of jury nullification is \u201cpremised on the idea that ordinary citizens, not government officials, should have the final say \\nIn a world of \u201c rampant overcriminalization ,\u201d where the average citizen unknowingly breaks three laws a day, jury nullification acts as \u201c a check on runaway authoritarian criminalization \\nIndeed, Butler believes so strongly in the power of nullification to balance the scales between the power of the prosecutor and the power of the people that he advises \\nIf you are ever on a jury in a marijuana case, I recommend that you vote \u201cnot guilty\u201d\u2014even if you think the defendant actually smoked pot, or sold it to another consenting adult. As a juror, you have this power under the Bill of Rights \\nNot only should the punishment fit the crime, but the laws of the land should also reflect the concerns of the citizenry as opposed to the profit-driven priorities of Corporate America. \\nThis is wh \\nVarious cities and states have been using this historic doctrine with mixed results on issues as wide ranging as gun control and healthcare to \u201c claim freedom from federal laws they find onerous or wrongheaded \\nFor the rest of us who are dependent on the \u201cfairness\u201d of the system, there exists a multitude of ways in which justice can and does go wrong every day. Police misconduct. Prosecutorial misconduct. Judicial bias. Inadequate defense. Prosecutors who care more about winning a case than seeking justice. Judges who care more about what is legal than wha \\nThe real and manufactured events of recent years\u2014the invasive surveillance, the extremism reports, the civil unrest, the protests, t \\nThose protests in Ferguson , Baltimore and Baton Rouge to protest police brutality?
