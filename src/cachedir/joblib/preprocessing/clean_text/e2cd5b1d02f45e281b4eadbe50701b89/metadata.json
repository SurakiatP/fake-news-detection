Martin Bishop woke up yesterday to news of Donald Trump\u2019s election, and thought it was a solid excuse to call his ex, Donna Sheridan, and ask her what she thought. Bishop said, \u201cI tried to call her after Brexit but I just got her answer machine. \u201c Today I got through though, which has nothing to do with the fact I\u2019ve got a new number. \u201c I asked her if everything was OK and if she\u2019d seen the election result and she said she had. Then there was a bit of a silence so I asked her if she\u2019d come across that cordless drill I couldn\u2019t find when I moved out. \u201c She said she hadn\u2019t, so then I asked her if that dipshit barman she was screwing now even knew what a Black and Decker was and then she hung up on me. \u201c Fucking Trump.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563306.9802532}
