Turkish officials said the killer had been a police officer who, after shooting, shouted: \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo! Don\u2019t forget Syria!\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry called the assassination a terrorist attack. Here\u2019s what we know about Mr. Karlov. \u2022 Mr. Karlov had been Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey since July 2013, according to a biography on the website of the Russian Embassy. \u2022 Born in Moscow in 1954, he started his diplomatic career in his early 20s after graduating from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and the country\u2019s diplomatic academy. \u2022 Mr. Karlov previously served as the ambassador to North Korea. He was married and had a son. According to Russian news agencies, his wife fainted and was hospitalized after being informed of his death. \u2022 Richard Moore, the British ambassador to Turkey, described Mr. Karlov in a tweet after the attack as   hospitable and professional. \u2022 In a Facebook post, Alexander Matsegora, the Russian ambassador to North Korea, described Mr. Karlov as a close friend and recalled a visit over the summer during which \u201che talked a lot about Turkey, which he had come to love. \u201d Mr. Matsegora, who said he and Mr. Karlov had started working together in North Korea when they were very young, wrote, \u201cWe agreed that when we retire, which will happen some day, we will take turns visiting each other at our dachas. \u201d But after the attack, he continued: \u201cWe will not be visiting each other at our dachas. Because he is no more, and half of me, too, is no more. \u201d Mr. Karlov was repeatedly called upon to ease tensions over Russia\u2019s role in the Syrian civil war, which has left hundreds of thousands dead and spurred a refugee crisis that has shaken Europe. After months of fierce bombardment and failed diplomacy, the Syrian government began removing residents from the last   districts in the city of Aleppo last week. \u2022 After a Russian bombing in northern Syria targeted Turkmen, who were part of the forces against President Bashar   Mr. Karlov was summoned to Ankara and asked to convey a firm message to Moscow. \u201cIt was stressed that the Russian side\u2019s actions were not a fight against terror, but they bombed civilian Turkmen villages, and this could lead to serious consequences,\u201d the Turkish Foreign Ministry said at the time. \u2022 Last fall, before the Turkish government shot down the Russian jet near its border with Syria, it had repeatedly complained to Mr. Karlov about his country\u2019s intrusions into Turkish airspace. Tensions escalated, culminating in the Kremlin\u2019s cutting economic ties with Turkey. Historians said the assassination might have been the first of a Russian ambassador since Pyotr Voykov, a Soviet envoy to Poland, was shot to death in Warsaw in 1927. In the 19th century, Aleksandr Griboyedov, a poet and diplomat, died in Tehran after a mob stormed the Russian Embassy. Tensions between Russia and Turkey had been easing recently, and some analysts said that the assassination might bring the countries closer as they sought to take on terrorism. Televised comments by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia after the attack seemed to support that view. He declared that the shooting had been a provocation meant to disrupt the nations\u2019 ties. Mr. Putin added that there was only one possible reaction: Intensifying the \u201ccrackdown on terror. \u201d The two countries suffered a crisis in their relations last fall. In a paper released in June, Asli Aydintasbas, an international affairs expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, traced the fault lines to the conflict in Syria. \u201cTensions first began to rise as the   friends were sucked into the regional struggle for Syria  \u2014   while Russia backed Assad, Turkey agitated for regime change,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs the alliance unraveled, Moscow broke the silent pact that neither side would support the other\u2019s separatists, and made moves to befriend the Kurds. But by June, economic actions that Russia had taken against Turkey after the jet was shot down were beginning to pay off as an absence of Russian visitors took a toll on Turkey\u2019s tourism industry. That month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan apologized for the downing, writing a letter that said he \u201cwould like to inform the family of the deceased Russian pilot that I share their pain and to offer my condolences to them. \u201d Turkey also announced that it would prosecute a man accused of killing the pilot after his plane was shot downed. At the time, experts said that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s change of heart on Russia had more to do with the necessities of domestic politics than any kind of broader vision about Turkey\u2019s place in the world.'"}, "time": 1742628437.4067779}
