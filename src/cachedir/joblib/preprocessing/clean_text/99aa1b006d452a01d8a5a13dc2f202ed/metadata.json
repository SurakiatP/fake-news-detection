What pathetic excuses for Irish men and women were in that pub last night at all,\u201d livid elderly man Tommy Cranley shared with WWN. \\nSome online news outlets had claimed that perhaps the barman who dropped the pint was in an empty pub at the time, which could explain the absence of a sarcastic jeer. A claim rubbished by many an Irish pub expert. \\n\u201cNonsense, sure if a pub is empty, there will always be someone passing by who hears it, and then cranes their neck in around the door, to slag the clumsy fucker. This is Ireland, not some cannibalistic wasteland,\u201d Rusty Jocks regular Vincent Clarkin added. \\nThe inquiry is said to also include a disturbing incident in Dublin when a barmaid ironically cheered herself as she smashed a glass, something which frowned upon in Irish pubs.'"}, "time": 1742563356.6566422}
