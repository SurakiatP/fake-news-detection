Coverage continues here &gt&gt \u2022 \u201cHurricane conditions\u201d are expected in much of the Bahamas Lake Okeechobee, Fla. and a long coastal stretch of the United States that includes Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton, West Palm Beach and St. Augustine in Florida, and Jekyll Island off Georgia, the National Hurricane Center announced at 5 a. m. The eye of the storm was expected to pass near Grand Bahama Island late Thursday and move \u201cvery close to the east coast of the Florida peninsula\u201d Thursday evening through Friday night. \u2022 The governors of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared emergencies, and more than 7, 800 National Guard soldiers were activated or placed on alert. \u2022 New York Times journalists assigned to cover the storm include Azam Ahmed, Mexico City bureau chief Lizette Alvarez in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Nick Madigan in Miami Frances Robles in Cocoa Beach, Fla. Les Neuhaus in Jacksonville, Fla. Alan Blinder in Atlanta Richard Fausset in Charleston, S. C. and Jess Bidgood in Wilmington, N. C. Gov. Rick Scott warned Floridians that the storm was expected to skim the state\u2019s Atlantic coastline so closely that a direct hit could not be ruled out. \u201cWe have to be prepared to be hit by a catastrophic hurricane,\u201d he warned at a news briefing at the state\u2019s Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee Wednesday morning. Hurricane Matthew, he said, was packing enough strength to cause the kind of \u201cmassive destruction we haven\u2019t seen in years. \u201d A hurricane warning was in effect for nearly 260 miles along the Interstate 95 corridor from the northern edge of   County to the Daytona Beach area. Mr. Scott urged residents to drive inland. \u201cIt could be the biggest evacuation ever,\u201d he said. Mandatory evacuations for the barrier islands in the hurricane warning areas were to begin Thursday at 8 a. m. The governor also pleaded with residents to start leaving early, before traffic backs up. \u201cWe have less than 24 hours left to prepare, evacuate and shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a plan in place would be the difference of life and death. \u201d Up and down the coast, Florida residents raced to make final preparations. Lines at gas stations stretched far beyond the pumps. Supermarkets were depleted of bottled water, bread and canned goods as people waited patiently to pay up and get out. Planters and lawn furniture were being hustled inside. Flashlights were put within easy reach, and windows and glass doors were shielded by dusty hurricane shutters. Students, most of them too young to remember the danger of powerful hurricanes, celebrated the announcement that schools would close from along coastal counties from Miami to Jacksonville on Thursday and Friday.  \u2014   LIZETTE ALVAREZ Jami Baker, 29, a Florida native who lives in a   apartment in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, a few blocks from the waters of Biscayne Bay, spent part of Wednesday stocking up on water, wine and crackers. \u201cEveryone is in serious prep mode,\u201d she said. Ms. Baker\u2019s mother is 60 years old and her father is a decade older. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about my parents, who are in Boca Raton, where they\u2019ll be getting the storm much worse,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be a nervous wreck if cell service goes out and I can\u2019t reach them. \u201d Ms. Baker, a public relations executive, said she had two other concerns: losing electrical power, and the fact that in her neighborhood, several   building projects are underway. \u201cI\u2019m surrounded by cranes and construction materials that are seemingly loose. I\u2019m sure these construction firms have storm protocol, but it\u2019s been a while since we had a major storm. \u201d  \u2014   NICK MADIGAN Even people not directly in the storm\u2019s path can be badly affected by its intensity, said Leanne Tellam, a    resident of Palmetto Bay, a Miami suburb, who went through Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and what she called the \u201ctrifecta\u201d of storms in 2005. \u201cHurricane Matthew does pose a tremendous threat to the entire east coast of Florida,\u201d she said, \u201cif not from direct winds or storm surge, then from the psychological factors at play that cause rational people to clear shelves of bottled water in areas where the tap water is safe to drink, or to empty out gas stations. The balance of being prepared and being rational are blurred when you have a storm this big. \u201d Ms. Tellam, who moved to Miami from New Jersey with her parents when she was 2, tends to take such storms somewhat in stride. \u201cI have learned that I have enough in my house to withstand the loss of power for up to five days,\u201d said Ms. Tellam, who lives with her husband, Douglas, their three children and two dogs. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a great deal of time in the Bahamas and am really worried about what the storm surge and waves will do to my friends on the   places where there is no high ground when facing a storm like this,\u201d she said. \u2014   NICK MADIGAN Gov. Nikki R. Haley urged people to evacuate Charleston, the state\u2019s   city, as the hurricane threatened millions of people along the East Coast. She said that the evacuation of Charleston and part of its surrounding area would begin at 3 p. m. Wednesday, and that the authorities would reverse eastbound lanes on Interstate 26. Other areas of the South Carolina coast will be evacuated on Thursday morning, the governor said. \u201cFor those of you that are wondering whether you should leave or not, I again will tell you that if you do not leave, you are putting a law enforcement officer or a National Guardsman\u2019s life on the line when they have to go back and get you,\u201d Ms. Haley said, She estimated that the evacuation would affect about 250, 000 residents and countless tourists.  \u2014   ALAN BLINDER On Wednesday afternoon, the Walmart in North Charleston, S. C. was a predictable hive of commerce, of necessities purchased by the case. By 1:30 p. m. the water was almost all gone. There would be diapers enough for only a few babies more. The sound system played \u201cA Horse With No Name. \u201d Shoppers and their carts jostled in the food aisles. Maynard Terry, 40, had five cases of bottled water in a cart, along with his girlfriend\u2019s    daughter. Mr. Terry said they could not leave town, because his girlfriend\u2019s elderly grandmother refused. And someone needed to care for her. \u201cShe\u2019s in poor health and she\u2019s stubborn and she don\u2019t want to go,\u201d he said. He smiled, and said they were going to make the most of it. Soon everything would be closed. Soon there would be no distraction but the storm. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to chill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be family time. \u201d  \u2014   RICHARD FAUSSET Hundreds of yellow public school buses snaked around the massive complex housing the North Charleston Coliseum and the Charleston Area Convention Center in this suburb of South Carolina\u2019s   city, preparing to haul the elderly, the poor and those without cars  \u2014   or without a friend to drive them  \u2014   away from the Lowcountry before Hurricane Matthew struck. The buses were to leave at 3 p. m. and take the evacuees to Greenville, S. C. Jacqueline Holmes and her husband, Andrew, both 54, had come three hours early, with bags full of chips, water, deodorant and flushable wipes. Ms. Holmes\u2019s previous trips to the coliseum were for leisure. She saw Barry White in concert here, and Luther Vandross, and LL Cool J. In 1989, she also saw Hurricane Hugo lay waste to large parts of the Charleston area. She rode out that infamous storm in her parents\u2019 house. \u201cIt was the most terriblest thing I ever saw,\u201d Ms. Holmes said, as she walked along the asphalt toward a staging area in front of the convention center. Ms. Holmes, who speaks with the almost Caribbean Gullah lilt that distinguishes the speech of many   here, recalled, as if it were yesterday, the quiet before Hurricane Hugo hit, and the moment when the silence was shattered by a violent roar that sounded like a freight train coming. She remembers the trees yanked up along with their roots, strewn around her parents\u2019 yard.  \u2014   RICHARD FAUSSET President Obama urged people in coastal states to prepare. \u201cWe anticipate that not only is there still a chance that the core of the storm strikes Florida and some of the states further north, but even if you don\u2019t get the full force of the hurricane, we are still going to be seeing tropical force winds, the potential for a storm surge,\u201d Mr. Obama said Wednesday morning at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \u201cAnd all of that could have a devastating effect. \u201d The president, who postponed a Wednesday visit to Florida as the storm\u2019s path became clearer, said residents should be ready to flee with little warning. \u201cNow is the time for you to prepare in the event that you have to evacuate,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Even if residents are not ordered to leave, he said, \u201cit still makes sense for you to figure out what kind of plan do you have, what kind of preparations and supplies do you have. \u201d  \u2014   ALAN BLINDER In North Carolina, officials ordered the evacuation of Ocracoke Island, a popular destination for tourists in the Outer Banks. The storm is set to press through the Bahamas on Thursday, slowly passing over a large part of the islands with violent wind and rain, in addition to storm surges. It is expected to strike as a Category 3 hurricane, bringing a potential for   to   surge in water and more than a foot of rain, a combination that could lead to heavy flooding. \u201cOver the coming hours, days, weeks and months, if the forecasts are correct, Hurricane Matthew may well become a defining event in our country\u2019s history,\u201d Prime Minister Perry Christie said. \u201cIt is rare that the whole country will have been impacted so directly by a storm of such magnitude and severity. \u201d Infrastructure in the Bahamas, thanks to the heavy tourism industry, is likely to fare better than that of Haiti and Eastern Cuba, where the storm devastated stretches of the island, leaving massive flooding or piles of rubble in its wake. Hotels and other structures are better equipped, in many cases, to withstand the battering of wind and rain. All the same, the State Department has issued travel warnings asking travelers to avoid visiting the Bahamas as well as Turks and Caicos.  \u2014   AZAM AHMED Initial reports from the government of Haiti said that five people there had been killed, 10 people had been injured and one person was missing. The storm pummeled the southern coast on Tuesday, destroying homes and crops, sweeping away livestock and cutting off transportation as a large part of the Caribbean was pummeled by     winds and torrential rain. The top United Nations official in Haiti, Mourad Wahba, described the storm as \u201cthe largest humanitarian event\u201d in the country of 11 million since a devastating earthquake six years ago, with thousands scrambling for shelter. Haiti\u2019s civil protection agency said a bridge collapse had severed the main highway connecting the south with    the capital. Interior Minister Fran\u00e7ois Anick Joseph said Tuesday night that 14, 530 people had been evacuated and that about 2, 200 homes were flooded or destroyed. As of Wednesday morning, the storm, which was downgraded to Category 3, from Category 4, had passed through Cuba, and the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned that a dangerous surge was beginning to spread over the Bahamas, to the north.  \u2014   AZAM AHMED John Schwartz, a New York Times reporter who covers climate change and the environment, is answering reader questions about the storm. John rode out his first hurricane, Carla, in his hometown, Galveston, Tex. at the age of 4. He has covered the aftermath of Katrina, as well as other storms for The Times.  Ask your hurricane questions here.  When was the last big storm to hit Florida, and how does this compare? If Matthew hits Florida directly, it will be the first major hurricane to do so since Wilma in 2005, which caused damage estimated at $21 billion. How will Matthew compare? As the National Hurricane Center put it Thursday evening, \u201cWhen a hurricane is forecast to take a track roughly parallel to a coastline, as Matthew is forecast to do from Florida through South Carolina, it becomes very difficult to estimate impacts this far in advance. \u201d But Florida, especially, has been warned to batten down, and much of the East Coast is preparing for powerful winds and storm surge as well as torrential rain. Hi, John. Is it safe to visit my mother in Chestertown, Md.? Will we have a problem finding gasoline? Will the roads be blocked with displaced people, flooding and debris?  \u2014   Dan Wyatt Dan, I\u2019ve heard of no evacuation order there yet, and with the storm likely to be turning to the east in the next few days, the risk to the town could be diminishing. But hurricanes often spread well beyond the edges of the cone, and so your mother could expect high winds, a ton of rain to deal with, and the usual run on supplies. If you do go, it\u2019s a good idea to fill the gas tank before you head out. And keep an eye on the storm predictions from the National Hurricane Center. You can register to receive Kent County, Md. evacuation alerts and other emergency messages here. I live in Jacksonville, N. C. Should we be looking to evacuate anytime soon?  \u2014   Jamelia Hello, Jamelia! The risk to coastal towns in North Carolina has lessened a bit in the October 5   forecast released at 2 p. m. which you can see here: As you can see, the National Hurricane Center is suggesting that a few days from now the storm will take a sharp turn to the east, which could still mean Jacksonville would avoid a direct hit but could still feel effects of storm surge and heavy rains. Your best bet is to look to local authorities for alerts about whether or not to evacuate. At the same time, it\u2019s a good time to sit down and figure out what your evacuation plan would be, if necessary  \u2014   know the local hurricane evacuation routes, and figure out where you\u2019ll go while waiting for the storm to pass. And if a call for evacuation does come, take it seriously. Here\u2019s a great page from Ready. gov with good advice about how to prepare for evacuation. The maps appear to show prediction that the hurricane will make a radical turn to the right, to the east, out to sea. Why is that predicted? Are probabilities given that instead it may follow a more common path up the coast?  \u2014   Dick Purcell There are a number of factors at play here, Dick, including potential interactions with Tropical Storm Nicole over the weekend. A meteorologist, Ryan Maue, put out a lovely tweet earlier today showing the dance with Nicole: The National Hurricane Center notes in its 11 a. m. discussion of Matthew that the subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic could head east and push Matthew east and even south. But it\u2019s too early to say where this thing is going with any certainty, so keep watching Matthew at the National Hurricane Center, or your favorite source of weather news.'"}, "time": 1742562150.153125}
