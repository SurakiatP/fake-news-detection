The AAA motor club said that Monday\u2019s average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in Georgia was nearly $2. 32, up from $2. 26 on Sunday and about $2. 10 the previous Monday. Prices also increased in Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, even as state officials asked drivers to conserve supplies and avoid topping off their tanks. \u201cI urge the public to maintain regular consumption levels and travel schedules in order to reduce further interruption in fuel supply,\u201d Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia said in a statement. The rising prices and sporadic uncertainty here followed the rupture of a   pipeline that ordinarily carries about 1. 3 million barrels of refined gasoline a day. Colonial Pipeline, which operates the system and shut down the line soon after the discovery of the leak on Sept. 9, said up to 336, 000 gallons might have been spilled in Shelby County, Ala. south of Birmingham. Colonial said that it was installing a bypass and that the line could resume normal operations this week. Industry observers said the effects of the disruption would fade once gas was again flowing freely. \u201cPrices are likely to rise even further until the pipeline is fully restored,\u201d said Mark Jenkins, a spokesman for AAA. \u201cOnce repaired, prices should quickly begin to decline. \u201d But over the weekend and into Monday, people across the South used social media to document scattered shortages. Service station operators posted notices of how they had been forced to bring in gas from distant areas, and the authorities warned against price gouging. Despite the increases, most Southern states still posted lower average gasoline prices than other parts of the country. In South Carolina on Monday, drivers typically paid $2. 04 a gallon, well below the national average of $2. 21. In Alabama, officials said they were working to restore service and measure the damage from the leak. On Friday, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a corrective action order, noting the \u201cunknown probable cause of the failure\u201d and barring Colonial from reopening the pipeline without the government\u2019s approval. The agency, which used the order to outline its preliminary findings, also said high benzene and gasoline vapor levels had at one point kept emergency responders from the \u201cassumed failure site\u201d for about 83 hours. But officials appeared cautiously optimistic that the leak had not led to an environmental calamity. Although the federal government\u2019s order said officials found dead vegetation and wildlife after the spill was detected, the gasoline was not expected to reach the nearby Cahaba River. \u201cThere has been no indication that any material has made it to the river,\u201d the Cahaba Riverkeeper, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cWe remain confident that there has been no impact to area drinking water. \u201d Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama, who repeatedly praised Colonial\u2019s response after he visited a command center on Monday, expressed concern about the spill and its effects, but he also acknowledged the frailty of pipelines like the one that leaked in his state. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Mr. Bentley said. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying is there a tornado going to happen again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561786.1950238}
