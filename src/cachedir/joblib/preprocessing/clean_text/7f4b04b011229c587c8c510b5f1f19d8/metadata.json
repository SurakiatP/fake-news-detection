The coin, with a $100 face value, will commemorate the 225th anniversary of the Mint\u2019s coin production, the Mint and the Treasury Department announced on Thursday. Going on sale April 6, it will be 24 karats and weigh about an ounce. It is part of a series of commemorative coins that will be released every two years. Future ones will show Lady Liberty as Asian, Hispanic and Indian \u201cto reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the United States,\u201d the Mint said in a statement. The announcement comes at a pivotal cultural moment for the United States, a week away from a transfer of power, following a bruising election dominated by debates about immigration, race and political correctness. And Lady Liberty is among the most potent of American symbols. Her   depiction, a gift from France in 1886, stands in New York Harbor, a giant statue of a woman with white European features beckoning with a lamp to the refugees of the world. \u201cPart of our intent was to honor our tradition and heritage,\u201d Rhett Jeppson, the principal deputy director of the Mint, said in a phone interview on Friday. \u201cBut we also think it\u2019s always worthwhile to have a conversation about liberty, and we certainly have started that conversation. \u201d Do not expect to see anyone spending the coins at the store. Coins like this do not circulate for everyday use, but are minted for collectors in limited quantities. There will be 100, 000 of them with the black Lady Liberty. They will sell for far more than face value, depending on the value of gold, currently more than $1, 000 an ounce. \u201cAs we as a nation continue to evolve, so does Liberty\u2019s representation,\u201d Elisa Basnight, the chief of staff at the Mint, said at a presentation on Thursday in Washington. The coin\u2019s head (what the Mint calls the obverse) was designed by Justin Kunz and engraved by Phebe Hemphill, and it shows a profile of Lady Liberty with a crown of stars that holds back her hair. The tail (the reverse, in Mint lingo) shows an eagle in flight. Mr. Jeppson said that several women had approached him after seeing the coin and told him, \u201cshe looks like me when I was younger. \u201d \u201cI saw real value in that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat we see ourselves in the images in our coins. \u201d The Mint is expecting the coin to sell well, Mr. Jeppson said. Any profit the Mint generates from the sale of its coins is returned to the Treasury. Last year, the Mint sent about $600 million back to the federal government, Mr. Jeppson said. In addition to the 100, 000 gold coins  \u2014   more than is typical for this sort of commemorative coin  \u2014   that will be printed at West Point, the Mint will also produce 100, 000 of what it calls medals, silver reproductions of the image that will sell for around $40 to $50. \u201cThe silver medals will be done at Philadelphia, because that is the birthplace of the Mint,\u201d Mr. Jeppson said. The Coinage Act of 1792 established the Mint, and it also mandated that any coins produced include an image of \u201cliberty\u201d as well as an inscription of the word. Since then, the idea has appeared in many forms on American currency, both circulated and collectible, most often as the feminine Lady Liberty. \u201cWhen you look at the very first coins that we produced, they had a   Liberty on there,\u201d Mr. Jeppson said. These coins are already in production. The next ones in the series are in the planning stage. Rough guidelines are given to sets of artists and sculptors, some of whom are staff at the mint and others who are part of a pool, as Mr. Kunz was. Their work is then shared with the members of two commissions  \u2014   one a group of citizen advisers and one a fine arts commission  \u2014   who make recommendations on the final design for the coin. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for us to say what future coins will look like until we get there,\u201d Mr. Jeppson said. All American coins embody the idea of liberty, in keeping with the Mint\u2019s   mandate. But the new coin is what Mr. Jeppson called an \u201callegorical liberty,\u201d meaning Lady Liberty does not represent a specific figure from history. Women, in generic depictions or historic ones, have been underrepresented on American currency. The suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony appeared on $1 coins from 1979 to 1981, and Helen Keller, the author and activist, appeared on the reverse image of the Alabama state quarter in 2003. Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide who led Lewis and Clark to the West Coast, appeared on a $1 coin that has been minted since 2000. Last year, after a public campaign to put a woman on the $10 bill, the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, announced a broad remaking of the nation\u2019s paper currency  \u2014   the bills that, unlike a $100 coin, circulate among many Americans every day. Harriet Tubman, the abolitionist and former slave, will appear on the $20 bill, and women and civil rights leaders will be added to the $5 and $10 bills. Collectors expect the black Lady Liberty coin to be popular. Whenever the Mint does something new, it creates buzz, said Gilles Bransbourg, a curator with the American Numismatic Society and a research associate at New York University. \u201cIt\u2019s departing from any of the coins that have been produced so far,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sends a strong message that the Mint is departing from the tradition that will be perceived as very white. \u201d The Mint\u2019s recent commemorative productions have occasionally featured nonwhite characters, he said, pointing to a 2006 gold series that revived the popular \u201cIndian head\u201d nickel of the early 20th century. It shows an American Indian whose face is believed to be a combination of three different men who sat for its designer. Symbolism aside, the new Lady Liberty coin is \u201creally beautiful,\u201d said Jeff Garrett, the president of the American Numismatic Association, who saw the coin several months ago in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s struck in high relief, which means the high points are much higher than circulating coinage. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ll buy one for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably buy several. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628397.6098738}
