Trump\u2019s pick to be Treasury secretary, failed to disclose nearly $100 million of his assets on Senate Finance Committee disclosure documents and forgot to mention his role as a director of an investment fund located in a tax haven, an omission that Democrats said made him unfit to serve in one of the government\u2019s most important positions. The revelation came hours before Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, began testifying on Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee, which has historically been bipartisan in its demands for transparency from nominees. Mr. Mnuchin was ready to outline his vision for the economy and defend himself against claims that he headed a bank that ran a \u201cforeclosure machine\u201d during the financial crisis. \u201cThe Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the committee. \u201cWhen I look at Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s background, it\u2019s a stretch to find evidence he\u2019d be that kind of Treasury secretary. \u201d In a hearing marked by sharp exchanges, Mr. Mnuchin struggled to answer questions about his use of tax havens as a hedge fund manager and whether he thought such loopholes should be closed. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, pointedly asked Mr. Mnuchin if he was using Cayman Islands corporations to avoid taxation. He responded that he was working on behalf of his clients, in accordance with the law. \u201cLet me just be clear again: I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes for myself,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cI would love to work with the I. R. S. to close these tax issues that make no sense. \u201d He added: \u201cI would support changing the tax laws to make sure they are simpler and more effective. \u201d Republicans came to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s defense, suggesting that none of his omissions were willful, and they gave strong indications that they would vote for him. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, defended Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s business record and described him as extremely qualified for the job. \u201cObjectively speaking, I don\u2019t believe anyone can reasonably argue that Mr. Mnuchin is unqualified for the position,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cIf the confirmation process focused mainly on the question of a nominee\u2019s qualifications, there would be little, if any, opposition to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s nomination. \u201d But the process was also focused on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s financial disclosure form, and that prompted intense scrutiny. \u201cIn his revised questionnaire, Mr. Mnuchin disclosed several additional financial assets, including $95 million worth of real estate  \u2014   a   in New York City, a residence in Southampton, New York, a residence in Los Angeles, California, and $15 million in real estate holdings in Mexico,\u201d Democratic staff members of the Senate Finance Committee wrote in a memo on Thursday. \u201cMr. Mnuchin has claimed these omissions were due to a misunderstanding of the questionnaire. \u201d According to the memo, Mr. Mnuchin also initially failed to disclose that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, along with management posts in seven other investment funds. And he belatedly disclosed that his children own nearly $1 million in artwork. Asked about the omissions at the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin described them as a simple mistake made amid a mountain of bureaucracy. \u201cI think as you all can appreciate, filling out these government forms is quite complicated,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, noting that he had handed over 5, 000 pages of disclosures. \u201cLet me first say, any oversight, it was unintentional. \u201d But Democrats pounced and tied Mr. Mnuchin to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. Pressed as to whether his failure to disclose the information was an ethical lapse, Mr. Mnuchin insisted that he was following the guidance of his lawyers and made an innocent error. \u201cI assure you that these forms were very complicated,\u201d he said, explaining that he had pledged to be forthcoming to \u201cthe best of my knowledge. \u201d Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was unsatisfied with the response and shot back, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to understand the words \u2018list all positions. \u2019\u201d To that, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, added: \u201cNever before has the Senate considered such an ethically challenged slate of nominees for key cabinet positions. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s failure to disclose his Cayman Islands holdings just reeks of the swamp that the   promised to drain on the campaign trail. \u201d And American Bridge, the   Democratic super PAC, said Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s holdings were a sign that Mr. Trump\u2019s government would not look out for working class Americans. \u201cBy slamming through Mnuchin, Senate Republicans are becoming accessories to Trump\u2019s future corruption, helping him stack his cabinet with shady billionaires who, like Trump, will rig the government to serve their own interests at the expense of the American people,\u201d said Shripal Shah, vice president of American Bridge.'"}, "time": 1742564389.487501}
