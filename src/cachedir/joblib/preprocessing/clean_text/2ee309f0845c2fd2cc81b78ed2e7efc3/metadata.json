Reaction to President Trump\u2019s address tended to focus on its sober style. His seriousness of purpose and calls for unity reassured  \u2014   and surprised  \u2014   many listeners. \u201cI think it sounded great, like a utopia,\u201d one voter said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple. \u201d Indeed, Mr. Trump, who met with congressional Republican leaders on Wednesday, faces not only a committed Democratic opposition but a divided Republican Party. Today\u2019s episode of The Daily podcast examines the president\u2019s speech to Congress, his call for unity and his promise to protect America. Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device. _____ 2. Emboldened by encouraging signals from the Trump administration, populist leaders across Central and Eastern Europe are cracking on nongovernmental organizations once protected by Washington. Groups that promote open government, aid refugees and often serve as checks on authoritarian governments are being targeted. Organizations funded by George Soros, the liberal American billionaire, are facing particular ire, accused of working to flood Europe with Muslim refugees and transform \u201cChristian\u201d nations into multicultural stews of   globalism. _____ 3. Developments in Syria this week: Russia mistakenly bombed Syrian fighters being trained by the U. S. another unintended clash among the myriad forces operating on the battlefield. And U. N. investigators released a report detailing war crimes, calling the Syrian government\u2019s bombing of a humanitarian convoy in September, which killed 14 aid workers, \u201cone of the most egregious. \u201d Next door in Iraq, the battle for Mosul continues. Our reporter met a family fleeing the   portion of the city. _____ 4. Tornadoes lashed the Midwest, killing at least three people and leaving a trail of splintered homes, razed businesses and power outages. The severe weather isn\u2019t over yet. Forecasters said the   and Deep South were also at risk. _____ 5. Snap Inc. is losing money, but its valuation was set at $24 billion on the eve of its arrival on the New York Stock Exchange, one of the biggest market debuts in years. Shares of the Snapchat parent company were priced at $17, higher than expected in an indication of strong demand. _____ 6. Scientists may have found the oldest signs of life on Earth. Or not. Some researchers say ancient rocks in a remote geological outpost in Canada yielded bacteria fossils that could be up to 4. 2 billion years old, relatively soon after the planet\u2019s birth. Others are dubious  \u2014   and vocal. Such battles, an optimist observed, are \u201chow science progresses. \u201d _____ 7. In a sign that the era of the starchitect may be over, a modest team of three architects won their profession\u2019s highest honor: the Pritzker Prize. Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem and Ramon Vilalta set up shop in their hometown in Spain 30 years ago and are not   outside the country. Their major works include the Soulages Museum, in Rodez, France, and the Sant Antoni  \u2014   Joan Oliver Library in Barcelona. The award cited \u201ctheir intensely collaborative way of working together, where the creative process, commitment to vision and all responsibilities are shared equally. \u201d _____ 8. Los Angeles votes for mayor next Tuesday. The incumbent, Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, faces some criticism for being \u201cbureaucratic bland\u201d but seems assured of beating 10 challengers for a second term  \u2014   and possibly a bigger role in an embattled national party. We caught up with him at an outdoor cafe downtown, where he sipped green tea, fielded requests for money from a homeless man, and said: \u201cI think people mistake bloody noses for big accomplishments. Maybe because I don\u2019t draw blood, but we actually work well with people, that that is seen as cautious. \u201d _____ 9. Our tech writer says the sexism scandal at Uber feels like a watershed moment for Silicon Valley. \u201cThis could be the start of a deep,   and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women  \u2014   not just at Uber but across the tech business, too,\u201d he writes. _____ 10. Spring is almost here. Here\u2019s a guide to the season\u2019s most promising live events, from Bette Midler\u2019s star turn in \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d to Chris Rock\u2019s first standup tour in nearly a decade to The Weeknd\u2019s new North American jaunt. And don\u2019t forget \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d a new musical based on the hit film, coming to Broadway this spring after a London run. Above, Punxsutawney Phil, aka Raymond J. Lee, in transit. _____ 11. Finally, we\u2019ve been surfing the web for you. And we found lots of great stories that have nothing to do with politics. For instance, Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s fitness routine,  \u2019s special scent, the world\u2019s worst skier and a trip to infinity. Have a great night. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
