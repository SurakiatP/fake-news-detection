Good morning and welcome to the new cookbook season, which our Food reporters are celebrating in print and online today with our Cookbook Issue, a compendium of all the best new titles and recipes we could find on the shelves this fall. Of course, there are recipes, and we\u2019ll get to them soon enough. Before we do, though, please make sure to read Kim Severson\u2019s luminous profile of Alton Brown, which sees the television chef at a crossroads, hanging around his Georgia man cave and considering the future. Read, too, Melissa Clark\u2019s delightful examination of the British food writer Diana Henry, who has been on a tear of late, publishing excellent cookbook after excellent cookbook. Both articles come with recipes, naturally: for Mr. Brown\u2019s arctic char burger and his breakfast carbonara, and for Ms. Henry\u2019s tuna and white bean casserole, lamb rib chops with dates, feta, sumac and tahini, and sweet potatoes with yogurt and chile. Tejal Rao filed a terrific primer on the latest trend in cookbook aesthetics  \u2014   simple and modern. It comes with recipes as well: a   spaghetti dinner with tomatoes and kale from \u201cA Modern Way to Cook\u201d by Anna Jones, and a Swiss chard slab pie from Kristin Donnelly\u2019s \u201cModern Potluck. \u201d Check out Sara Bonisteel\u2019s article on \u201cLand of Fish and Rice\u201d by Fuchsia Dunlop and \u201cAll Under Heaven\u201d by Carolyn Phillips. And then cook: Shanghai noodles and bok choy, chicken congee, moo shu pork. Also: David Tanis on Naomi Duguid\u2019s \u201cTaste of Persia\u201d and her recipe for Baku fish kebabs with   sauce. Here\u2019s Florence Fabricant on \u201cEat in My Kitchen\u201d by Meike Peters and \u201cMozza at Home\u201d by Nancy Silverton. It comes with a fine recipe for a Mozza staff meal of   chicken thighs, and another for Ms. Peters\u2019s saut\u00e9ed endives with balsamic butter and marjoram. The presents keep coming! Oliver Strand dives into \u201cEverything I Want to Eat\u201d from the Los Angeles chef Jessica Koslow, and delivers recipes for sticky toffee   date cake and for a socca with shredded vegetables. And Sara has a second article looking at \u201cMy Two Souths\u201d by Asha Gomez she delivers Ms. Gomez\u2019s recipe for weeknight fancy chicken and rice along with it. Here\u2019s Christine Muhlke on Naomi Pomeroy\u2019s cookbook \u201cTaste and Technique,\u201d which comes with a recipe for fennel gratin. And Margaux Laskey on \u201cPoole\u2019s: Recipes and Stories From a Modern Diner\u201d by Ashley Christensen, with her recipes for hummingbird cake and a broccoli salad with Cheddar, bacon, grapes and pecans. Emily Weinstein helps round out the table with a look at Marcus Samuelsson\u2019s \u201cThe Red Rooster Cookbook\u201d and his recipe for the short ribs he cooked for President Obama. That\u2019s a lot of new recipes for you! Of course, on a Wednesday night in late September, you may not want a recipe at all. Join us instead for a   recipe for a tomato salad that we hacked out of Gabrielle Hamilton\u2019s exquisite and bossy \u201cPrune\u201d this weekend. Get the best beefsteak or heirloom tomatoes you can find at the market today. (And they\u2019re still out there!) Cut them into thick planks and arrange them prettily on a platter. Heat some good salted butter in a pan until it is foamy and about to brown, then pour it all over the tomatoes. Sprinkle some sea salt over the top and serve with bread. It\u2019s legit the best meal imaginable for this time of the year. Or take a spin through Cooking to find something else. And if you run into trouble, reach out for help: cookingcare@nytimes. com. We want you to be happy. See you on Friday.'"}, "time": 1742563130.2106664}
