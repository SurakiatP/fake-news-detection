There is a waiting period, a written test and a number of restrictions on guns and gear. Some voters pondering Proposition 63 have asked: Haven\u2019t we done enough? Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, says no. He\u2019s developed the initiative that would push the state\u2019s gun limits even further. Under Proposition 63, ammunition purchasers would be treated similar to gun purchasers. Before a Californian could buy even a single bullet of any kind, he or she would need to pay a fee of up to $50 and wait up to 30 days to obtain a   permit. \u201cThe game changer in the country is going to be ammunition background checks,\u201d Mr. Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, said in a phone interview. Proposition 63 has drawn vehement opposition from civil liberties and policing groups who argue that it would make Californians less safe and impede law enforcement. What\u2019s more, they note, the state already created a law this year that added background checks for bullet buyers at the point of sale. (Mr. Newsom said that bill did not go far enough.) Critically, opponents say, the wait time could put people in danger. In one of the opposition group\u2019s campaign ads, a lone woman is depicted pulling a gun against an attacker in a dim parking lot, only to pull the trigger and hear the \u201cclick\u201d of an unloaded weapon. \u201cAll Proposition 63 seeks to do is pile on 34 more pages of more complex legalese on an already byzantine system of gun laws,\u201d said Sean Brady, counsel for the Coalition for Civil Liberties. Proposition 63 also adds new felony charges for stealing firearms, broadens a ban on large capacity magazines and requires all felons to surrender their guns, among other measures. Since 2000, the rate of gun violence in California has fallen by about 20 percent, according to Garen J. Wintemute, an epidemiologist who studies firearm violence at U. C. Davis. Whether that can be credited to tough gun measures is a subject of disagreement. But firearm dealers say at least one outcome of the debate is certain: more sales. Californians have been buying more guns than ever  \u2014   last year, more than 890, 000.
