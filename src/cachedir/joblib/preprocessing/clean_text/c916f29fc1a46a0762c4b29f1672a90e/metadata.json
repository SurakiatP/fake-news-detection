Redstone\u2019s $40 billion media empire have close connections to his   recently reconciled daughter, Shari Redstone, according to three people briefed on the matter. The developments are likely to be cited by Viacom executives as evidence of Ms. Redstone\u2019s role in the contentious   over the weekend of the   succession plans for her father\u2019s companies. On Friday, two longtime confidants of Mr. Redstone, 92, were unexpectedly removed from their positions on the trust that will control Mr. Redstone\u2019s companies after he dies or is declared incompetent. They were also separated from the board of National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting stock in Viacom and CBS, two of the world\u2019s largest entertainment companies. One person expected to be named to the trust is Thaddeus Jankowski, the senior vice president and general counsel of National Amusements, according to people with knowledge of the development, who requested anonymity because the deliberations are private. Ms. Redstone is a director and president of National Amusements, where she holds a position of authority over Mr. Jankowski. Viacom executives and directors on Saturday questioned Mr. Redstone\u2019s competency in making the sudden changes and asserted that he had been manipulated by his daughter. On Sunday evening, Mr. Redstone released a statement through a spokesman in which he attested to being independent and \u201cengaged, attentive and as opinionated as ever. \u201d He also disputed claims made over the weekend by Viacom directors and executives that company directors had been denied access to him. According to the statement, Mr. Redstone is opposed to the plans underway by Viacom leadership to sell a stake in Paramount Pictures, the film and television studio. Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, has said that a deal should be reached by the end of June. \u201cMr. Redstone regrets that Mr. Dauman has diverted resources to these baseless attacks and misrepresentations, rather than focusing on the continuing challenges that are faced by Viacom,\u201d the spokesman, Mike Lawrence, said in the statement. In a later statement, Carl Folta, a Viacom spokesman, said that the company was \u201cdeeply troubled and saddened by this state of affairs. \u201d He outlined how Viacom directors addressed company issues, including the sale of a stake in Paramount, during 12 hours of meetings last week that Mr. Redstone attended by phone. Upon Mr. Redstone\u2019s death or upon him being declared incompetent, his control of the voting stock in Viacom and CBS is to pass to the    trust, with his five grandchildren as the beneficiaries. Ms. Redstone is vice chairwoman of Viacom and CBS and one of the seven members of the trust. Mr. Dauman was unexpectedly dismissed from the trust and removed from the board of National Amusements on Friday. George Abrams, a Viacom director, a representative of Mr. Redstone\u2019s for 50 years and an ally of Mr. Dauman, was also removed from both positions that day. Their swift removal was seen as a major victory for Ms. Redstone in her quest to dictate the future of her father\u2019s media empire. She has publicly opposed Mr. Dauman\u2019s leadership of Viacom. In addition to Mr. Jankowski, the other person expected to be appointed to the trust is an undisclosed friend of Ms. Redstone, two of the people briefed on the matter said. Ms. Redstone\u2019s daughter, Kimberlee Ostheimer, was also put forth to serve on the board of National Amusements, the three people said. Mr. Jankowski and Ms. Ostheimer also could not be reached for comment. The weekend\u2019s developments prompted immediate questions about whether or not Mr. Redstone, who is in poor health, was competent to make those decisions and what role Ms. Redstone might have played in influencing her father. In a statement on Saturday, Ms. Redstone said, \u201cI fully support my father\u2019s decisions and respect his authority to make them. \u201d Mr. Dauman called the moves \u201cinvalid and illegal\u201d and said Mr. Redstone had lacked the capacity to have taken such steps. Mr. Lawrence disputed that Viacom directors had been restricted from seeing Mr. Redstone. In his statement on Sunday, he detailed how Mr. Redstone sent a letter through a lawyer to Mr. Dauman, Mr. Abrams and Frederic Salerno, another Viacom director, on May 16 to ask for details about Viacom\u2019s business and share price, which has declined 40 percent over the past year, but received no response. Mr. Folta, the Viacom spokesman, said that two directors have \u201cstill been unable to meet with Mr. Redstone. \u201d \u201cThe Sumner Redstone we knew would never refuse a meeting about his businesses and he certainly would not want advisers to stand in for him,\u201d Mr. Folta said. Mr. Lawrence attested to Mr. Redstone\u2019s vitality. He said that over the past several days Mr. Redstone had hosted family and friends at his home and also met with lawyers and an executive from National Amusements. Mr. Redstone was also \u201clooking forward to celebrating his birthday with family later this week,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said.'"}, "time": 1742562047.1431017}
