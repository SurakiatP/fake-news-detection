Arnoldski - \\n\\n\\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation has directly pressured Russian diplomats and forbid them from being near voting places during the presidential elections in the United States on November 8th. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman of the Russian foreign ministry, wrote about this on her Facebook page on Monday. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s come to openly intimidating the staff of diplomatic agencies. The State Department recommended Russian representatives in a memo \u2018not to come to polling stations on their own\u2019, and some states\u2019 authorities have gone even further and threatened criminal prosecution. This means that they can\u2019t even watch the voting procedure,\u201d Zakharova wrote. \\nAccording to Zakharova, in recent days, direct pressure has been put on Russian representatives in the United States by the FBI, \u201cwhose agents, with undisguised threats, have let us know that we should not be interested in the American elections.\u201d \\n\u201cIn Houston, in order to offer such a \u2018warning,\u2019 a Hollywood-style special operation was arranged that blocked the car of our Consulate General\u2019s employees on the street. They stopped the car and started to \u2018convince\u2019 them that they should not watch the voting, and not even think about it,\u201d Zakharova added. \\n\\nIn connection with the incident with the Russian embassy in Washington, a relevant submission has already been made to the State Department.  \\n\u201cBut the question arises: what can a foreign diplomat see at American polling stations that is so important that they\u2019ve brought in \u2018Mr. Smith\u2019, and why are election monitoring procedures controlled by the FBI?!\u201d, the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s representative concluded.  \\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n'"}, "time": 1742563857.521329}
