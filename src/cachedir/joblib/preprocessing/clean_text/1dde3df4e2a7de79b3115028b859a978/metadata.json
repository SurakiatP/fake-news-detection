The movement is celebrated by the United Nations, which works to \u201ccreate a historic legacy of   strategies, standards, programs and goals to advance the status of women worldwide. \u201d While American women still have plenty worth fighting for, the status of women internationally doesn\u2019t compare. Women\u2019s strikers\u2019 decision to hijack this day shows just how far out of touch they are with the more serious problems facing hundreds of millions of women worldwide \u2014  problems ranging from human trafficking, sexual exploitation, forced marriage, and female genital mutilation to brutal murders masked in \u201chonor. \u201d Our foreign sisters need our help, and International Women\u2019s Day should be about them. Not us. Said Harkness to Kassam regarding today\u2019s protests ignoring many issues that plague the Muslim world, such as genital mutilation, \u201cI think one of the reasons we don\u2019t often hear about it from these women\u2019s march feminists is because it\u2019s a very inconvenient narrative to what they stand for  \u2026    . Harkness continued, a lot of these injustices are actually occurring in Muslim countries and they don\u2019t want to being attention to it. One of the founders of the women\u2019s march is Muslim. Why aren\u2019t we hearing from her on International Women\u2019s day about this issue?\u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
