During his joint press conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, President Donald Trump said he would be \u201c100 percent\u201d be willing to testify under oath about his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey.  Partial transcript as follows: ABC\u2019s JON KARL: I want to get back to James Comey\u2019s testimony. You suggested he didn\u2019t tell the truth in everything he said. He did say under oath that you told him to let the Flynn  \u2014   you said you hoped you could let the Flynn investigation go. TRUMP: I didn\u2019t say that. KARL: So he lied about that? TRUMP: Well, I didn\u2019t say that. I will tell you. I didn\u2019t say that. KARL: And did you ask you to pledge loyalty? TRUMP: And there would be nothing wrong if I did say it read today but I did not say that. KARL: And did he ask you for a pledge of loyalty from you? TRUMP: No, he did not. KARL: So he said those things under oath. Would you be willing to speak under oath and give your version of those events? TRUMP: 100%. I hardly know the man. I\u2019m not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance. What would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? Think of that. I hardly know the man. It doesn\u2019t make sense. No, I didn\u2019t say that, and I didn\u2019t say the other. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628353.9797664}
