Trump has mollified many Democrats alarmed about the    presidential race  \u2014   while inflaming Republican fears that Mr. Trump\u2019s improvisational style and skeletal campaign will prove inadequate in repelling the type of attack Mrs. Clinton unleashed on Thursday. Mixing stark warnings that Mr. Trump would imperil America\u2019s security with caustic personal critiques  \u2014   \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants\u201d  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton offered the first indication that she was willing to confront her unconventional opponent in the fashion many in her party believe his candidacy demands. \u201cI thought it was one of the most important speeches Secretary Clinton has made throughout this campaign because it drew a line that for most of this campaign has not been drawn,\u201d said Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary, arguing that Mr. Trump had \u201cgotten away with murder\u201d with his incendiary proposals and statements. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech in San Diego drove home that \u201cthis is not just the fun and games of a primary, but a choice for the American people about who is going to sit in the Oval Office,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. Democrats across the country expressed relief on Friday that Mrs. Clinton had finally delivered a comprehensive indictment of Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for the presidency. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said there had been \u201cwidespread concern\u201d among Senate Democrats that Mrs. Clinton was not drawing sharp enough contrasts with Mr. Trump. \u201cThis speech really did that,\u201d he said. Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who was attending the Detroit Chamber of Commerce\u2019s annual retreat on Mackinac Island with many of the state\u2019s most influential leaders, said, \u201cThe people up here who were worried about her said she is finally finding her groove. \u201d For several weeks, Mrs. Clinton had tried out a version of the campaign President Obama ran against Mitt Romney in 2012, portraying Mr. Trump as a heartless corporate titan who profited off the housing crisis and avoided paying taxes. But she was receiving scant news media coverage, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers worried that voters were not as moved by   attacks against someone who unapologetically boasts about his wealth. After weeks in which Mr. Trump viciously attacked Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, over Mr. Clinton\u2019s indiscretions, moreover, it had become clear that she needed a circuit breaker in the form of a more robust counterassault  \u2014   and one that she could deliver herself, rather than relying on surrogates to deal the most forceful blows to Mr. Trump on her behalf. Her campaign\u2019s decision was to seek to disqualify Mr. Trump on terrain that is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comfort zone: foreign policy. But billing her San Diego speech on Thursday as a foreign policy address was also something of a ruse: It turned out to be an acidly funny takedown of Mr. Trump and his temperament, giving him the same sort of belittling treatment he had used on his opponents to great effect. \u201cThere\u2019s no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf course deal,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at one point. But as satisfying as her new line of attack was to many Democrats, as Mr. Panetta said, \u201cThe real question is going to be, \u2018Where does it go from here? \u2019\u201d Indeed, Mrs. Clinton returned to a familiar stump speech later on Thursday in El Centro, Calif. though on a stop to a campaign office in San Diego, she joked about her new offensive. \u201cI was listing all the reasons why Donald Trump should never get near the White House,\u201d she told volunteers, adding, \u201cAnd even I was getting nervous. \u201d If Mrs. Clinton is able to overcome that nervousness and drive a sustained attack echoing her San Diego speech, some Democrats said she could negatively define Mr. Trump this summer the same way that Mr. Clinton managed to define Bob Dole in their 1996 presidential race. \u201cWhat she did sets the parameters about what this election is about,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, who was Mr. Clinton\u2019s campaign press secretary that year. \u201cIt is very hard to change that in the    fight after Labor Day. \u201d That prospect, in turn, has Republicans deeply concerned about Mr. Trump. Despite being the party\u2019s presumptive nominee for a month, Mr. Trump has yet to adapt his campaign to the demands of a general election. His only \u201cwar room\u201d so far is his Twitter feed. He is campaigning in California, insisting that he can win one of the country\u2019s most liberal states. He has spent a week attacking a Hispanic federal judge who is handling a lawsuit against him in increasingly racial terms, only drawing more attention to the case. And he continues to divide his attention: He will travel to Scotland and Ireland this month for a business event. Nor have Mr. Trump\u2019s tactical choices inspired confidence. At a rally on Thursday night in San Jose, Calif. his main rejoinder to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech was that she ought to be in jail over her use of a private email account as secretary of state. There was no broader counterattack from his campaign or his allies, a remarkable silence after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s harshest critique yet. \u201cHe needs to get the Republican chorus singing for him, and making sure he\u2019s got a lot of voices out there,\u201d said Terry Nelson, a longtime Republican strategist. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make sure he is reaching out to the party and letting them know what the message is, what to say and how to say it. \u201d There is little evidence of any such coordination. His campaign sent out no response to the Clinton speech. The Republican National Committee, on which Mr. Trump\u2019s team has been leaning heavily, issued just one   critique of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s foreign policy before her remarks. His campaign is also badly lagging behind the Democrats at   and there are signs this has affected spending: After a group supporting Mrs. Clinton ran ads last month against Mr. Trump, the Trump team asked about rates for television ads of its own, according to two media buyers apprised of those inquiries, but never followed up. Reached by phone, Mr. Trump addressed such concerns by saying he had proved he could rewrite political playbooks. \u201cI think I\u2019m defining her,\u201d he said of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI think she\u2019s being defined as a weak and ineffective person. \u201d Mr. Trump has four top aides who worked on Mr. Dole\u2019s 1996 campaign. But his campaign\u2019s problems already resemble some that plagued Mr. Dole, including a formidable opponent mounting an early offensive, and an undisciplined candidate. Mr. Dole said on Friday that Mr. Trump, whom he has endorsed, had mastered   and commanding media attention like no other recent nominee. But he warned that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech signaled a need for Mr. Trump to adjust. \u201cI think Hillary tried laying a groundwork, and I think that\u2019s going to be sort of her template,\u201d Mr. Dole said in an interview. \u201cHe has criticism of Hillary, but it\u2019s sort of been scattered. \u201d Mr. Trump, he added, \u201chas got to catch up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562107.7318845}
