John McCain after the veteran senator criticized his decision to launch a military mission in Yemen. [\u201cSen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.  The White House deemed the mission a success, but Navy SEAL William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens was killed. McCain, however, appeared vexed by the raid\u2019s conclusion, describing it as a \u201cfailure\u201d due to the loss of life in the mission and the enemy\u2019s awareness of the attack. Trump ridiculed McCain for getting the country in numerous conflicts around the world. \u201cHe\u2019s been losing so long he doesn\u2019t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in  \u2014   bogged down in conflict all over the place,\u201d Trump added. Trump said that the Navy SEAL who was slain in the mission was a \u201chero\u201d and reminded McCain that Secretary of Defense General James Mattis described the   mission in Yemen as a success, not a failure. \u201cTime for the U. S. to get smart and start winning again!\u201d Trump concluded. On Wednesday, press secretary Sean Spicer called for McCain to apologize for his statement, asserting the senator did \u201cdisservice\u201d to the slain Navy SEAL\u2019s sacrifice. \u201cI think anybody who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and [does] disservice to the life of Chief Owens,\u201d Spicer said during the White House press briefing. In response, McCain cited his military service and his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, suggesting that Spicer had little room to criticize him on matters of war.'"}, "time": 1742628496.8406174}
