C at the National Press Club during a news conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) said while she has not seen a completed case for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment, a \u201cvery scientific, methodical way\u201d was being made.  Pelosi said, \u201cThe case is being made about the emoluments clause and you have to have evidence and the rest, but the case has not fully been made. The fact is that when I was speaker after we won in \u201906  \u2014   in \u201907 people wanted me to impeach President Bush because of the war in Iraq. I never recovered with the left on this subject for not impeaching President Bush because of the war in Iraq. You don\u2019t impeach somebody because you don\u2019t like their policies. When they break the law, that\u2019s when you have grounds for impeachment. And at the time of the war, I said, as a top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, \u2018The intelligence does not support the threat,\u2019 and so did Senator Bob Graham. \u201d \u201cBut the administration was making this strong case with the American people. And perhaps misrepresenting the American people could be a cause for impeachment,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf so, there\u2019s plenty of grounds right now with the current president, but it just isn\u2019t the case. That doesn\u2019t mean nobody is listening to cases that are being made in a very scientific, methodical way as to whether there are grounds for an impeachment. But the fact is that we\u2019re trying to unite the country. Many of the President\u2019s supporters are just not ready to accept the fact that their judgment might not have been so great in voting for him. And by the time the case is made, perhaps they\u2019ll be ready to accept that. It\u2019s very hard, impeachment. It\u2019s very hard. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628594.0303504}
