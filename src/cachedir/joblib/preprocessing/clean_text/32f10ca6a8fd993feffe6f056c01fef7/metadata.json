Trump\u2019s business record and assailed his ideas, warning that the coming weeks represented a critical period in which, if left unchallenged, Mr. Trump could \u201cnormalize himself\u201d as he seeks to broaden his support. But Mr. Sanders pointed to polls showing Mrs. Clinton with dangerously high percentages of people who have unfavorable views of her and asked whether a choice between her and Mr. Trump in the fall would force voters to pick the \u201clesser of two evils. \u201d Even as she contends with Mr. Sanders\u2019s unflagging critique from the left, Mrs. Clinton said it was vital for her to pivot to confront Mr. Trump now, lest he successfully repackage himself for wider consumption, rather than appealing to the Republican primary electorate alone. \u201cI do not want Americans and, you know,   Republicans, as well as Democrats and independents, to start to believe that this is a normal candidacy,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press. \u201d \u201cI know he has a plurality of Republicans who have voted for him,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I think in the course of this campaign, we are going to demonstrate he has no ideas. There\u2019s no evidence he has any ideas about making America great, as he advertises. He seems to be particularly focused on making himself appear great. And as we go through this campaign, we\u2019re going to be demonstrating the hollowness of his rhetoric. \u201d Mrs. Clinton also poked at Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to release his tax returns. Told that Mark Cuban, the media executive and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, had expressed interest in being her running mate, Mrs. Clinton said she was \u201cabsolutely\u201d open to considering business leaders, not just elected officials. \u201cBusinesspeople, especially successful businesspeople, who are really successful  \u2014   as opposed to pretend successful  \u2014   I think, have a lot to offer,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign has begun taunting Mr. Trump with a #PoorDonald hashtag on Twitter, suggesting that he is not nearly as wealthy as he claims. Mr. Trump has cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as his reason for keeping his tax returns private. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get below the hype,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI think we\u2019re beginning to find out, but I don\u2019t think we know enough, and that\u2019s why he should release his tax returns. \u201d In choosing a running mate, Mrs. Clinton said she would seek, above all, someone prepared to be president and \u201csomeone you can work with  \u2014   someone you believe will be a good partner. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s intense focus on Mr. Trump came as a new ABC   Post poll showed the two    among registered voters in a general election matchup, after Mrs. Clinton had led by nine percentage points in March. Voters have widely unfavorable opinions of both candidates: 53 percent expressed such a view about Mrs. Clinton and 60 percent about Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders, however, vowed on Sunday to fight all the way to the Democratic convention in July, pointing to polls that indicated he would fare better against Mr. Trump than Mrs. Clinton would. In several television interviews, he complained that Democratic superdelegates had thrown their support to Mrs. Clinton before he had even entered the race. \u201cI ask those superdelegates to take a look at which candidate is the stronger to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Sanders said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the American people voting for the lesser of two evils. \u201d When the host George Stephanopoulos followed up by asking if he saw Mrs. Clinton as \u201cthe lesser of two evils,\u201d Mr. Sanders backed away slightly. \u201cWell, if you look at  \u2014   no, I wouldn\u2019t describe it, but that\u2019s what the American people are saying,\u201d he said, citing her unfavorable ratings. Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton will be campaigning hard in California, which holds its primary on June 7. In Vista, Calif. on Sunday, Mr. Sanders told a cheering crowd that he was the strongest Democratic candidate to defeat Mr. Trump and that he hoped to have 50 percent of the total pledged delegates by the end of voting. He also stressed that his campaign had more \u201centhusiasm\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d than his rival\u2019s. \u201cOur vision of social justice, of economic justice, of racial justice and of environmental justice  \u2014   our vision is the future of this country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cAnd I hope the leadership of the Democratic Party understands it must be the vision of the Democratic Party. \u201d Mrs. Clinton drew criticism from some Democrats and Republicans recently after telling voters she would put her husband, former President Bill Clinton, \u201cin charge of revitalizing the economy\u201d and job creation. On Sunday, she clarified her intentions, saying his role would be advisory, not ministerial. \u201cI am going to ask my husband, who has a great track record in creating jobs, putting people back to work, revitalizing communities, to be in an advisory role working with me, working with our cabinet, to try to figure out what we can do\u201d in particularly   areas, Mrs. Clinton said on NBC. \u201cYou know, every first lady has taken on special projects. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564466.2898943}
