[The festival is part of a series of events marking fifty years since the passing of legislation partially decriminalising homosexuality in the UK, dubbed the \u2018Prejudice and Pride\u2019 season. But, in a segment for the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics, Delingpole took aim the National Trust for stepping beyond its mandate in promoting such politicised events.     <! [CDATA[_informq. push([\u2019embed\u2019])   ]]&gt, The National Trust owns and preserves many of Britain\u2019s notable historical properties and great houses a role which Delingpole lauded  \u2014   he often took his children to visit their properties when they were young, he said. But, he continued, \u201cI gave up on the National Trust when it gave up on its day job. \u201cInstead of preserving our heritage it started dabbling in politics. It came out against fox hunting and started campaigning against global warming  \u2014   it jumped on the political correctness bandwagon. \u201cBritain, as we\u2019re well aware, has a fine and glorious tradition of stately homos. The Trust\u2019s greatest director James   was a delightfully bitchy queen. But so what?\u201d Delingpole asked. \u201cWhat exactly does sexuality have to do with heritage? Aren\u2019t there already enough   charities out there, treating us like primary school children, telling us what to think about the politically correct matters of the moment?\u201d The National Trust, Delingpole argued \u201cis the guardian of our history, not some trendy social justice warrior\u201d. He concluded: \u201cMaybe if enough of us resign our memberships, it might take the hint. \u201d The BBC invited a National Trust spokesman to debate Delingpole on the program, but no spokesman was offered. However, fellow guest Nus Ghani, the Conservative MP for Wealden countered \u201cIt\u2019s important that these properties show the history of who lived there, whether they\u2019re lesbian, gay, or transgender. I think it\u2019s also important that the National Trust shows the stories of people that lived there that were oppressed [sic] and also the heroes as well. Suggesting that Delingpole had a racist agenda, she added: \u201cAlso it\u2019s important that people of all backgrounds visit these properties, and I worry that\u2019s going to upset you, when we all turn up and we don\u2019t all look like you. \u201d Delingpole shot back \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what I would expect a   member of the modern Tory party to say. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562903.6408882}
