The article, which appeared this week and also threatened further attacks in the country, bears the byline of Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury, a militant who was killed with two associates in a police raid in late August. Mr. Chowdhury, a Canadian citizen, had been identified by some analysts as the coordinator of the Islamic State\u2019s activities in South Asia but had never been named by the group. It is unusual for the Islamic State to publish the real names of its fighters, said Amarnath Amarasingam, a fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism. Mr. Amarasingam said the Islamic State has been eager to \u201ctake ownership\u201d of the Dhaka attack, which came at a time of military setbacks in its core territory in the Middle East. Since Mr. Chowdhury\u2019s death, there has been a lull in the   attacks on foreigners, secular Bangladeshis and members of religious minorities that had occurred at regular intervals in recent years. The July attack, on the Holey Artisan Bakery, in which 22 people were killed, was the most complex and   operation to date by Islamic militants in Bangladesh\u2019s recent history. Among the dead were numerous foreigners working in Bangladesh\u2019s garment sector or for aid organizations. In the aftermath of the attack, Bangladesh officials were under pressure to acknowledge that transnational terrorist organizations like the Islamic State were trying to build a presence in the country. The authorities in Dhaka are still investigating the attack, and said on Wednesday that they were analyzing the account in Rumiya, the Islamic State\u2019s newest media product. \u201cIt is a long piece, with a lot of information to go through, so I cannot speak clearly now on things like authenticity,\u201d said Sanwar Hossain, additional deputy commissioner of the counterterrorism unit in the Dhaka Metropolitan police. He said that the police also knew Mr. Chowdhury by the kuniya, or nom de guerre, cited in the magazine. \u201cWe have known for a while that this is how Tamim Chowdhury was referred to,\u201d he said. On Sunday, police granted bail and released Tahmid Hasib Khan, a Bangladeshi man. A second hostage, Hasnat Karim, remains in police custody, though some of the charges against him have been dismissed in court. Sharmina Parveen Karim, Mr. Karim\u2019s wife, said she hoped her husband would be released soon. \u201cWe are just waiting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything but wait. \u201d The article published in Rumiyah said the Holey Artisan Bakery had been selected as a target because it was \u201ca sinister place where the Crusaders would gather to drink alcohol and commit vices throughout the night, feeling secure from the wrath of Allah that was awaiting them. \u201d It said the attackers set out to kill only   in the restaurant and sorted their prisoners by religion, asking \u201cvery basic religious questions whose answers any Muslim youth or elderly would know. \u201d \u201cThose who proved their Islam were treated with respect and mercy,\u201d the account says, while those who did not \u201cwere treated with harshness and severity. \u201d The account partially tallied with the testimonies of survivors. A Bangladeshi cook who survived said gunmen told him not to worry, because the attackers were killing only foreigners. Ms. Karim, who was dining at the restaurant with her husband and two children, said the attackers had targeted Japanese and Italian customers who were obvious foreigners at first, and later began to ask those who remained whether they were Bangladeshi Muslims. \u201cThey entered and started shooting straight away,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were screaming, \u2018Help, help,\u2019 and fell to the floor once they were shot. Once they were certain that people were injured, they started to chop their throats, hands. \u201d Ms. Karim added that as dawn approached, the attackers debated whether to kill the remaining hostages and decided against it. The article gives detailed biographies of the five attackers, noting that at least two had unsuccessfully tried to join Islamic State forces in Libya, Syria and other battlegrounds outside Bangladesh. It goes on to threaten further attacks on foreigners in Bangladesh, singling out \u201cexpats, tourists, diplomats, garment buyers, missionaries, sports teams and anyone else from the Crusader citizens to be found in Bengal. \u201d Masudur Rahman, a police spokesman, said that the police in Bangladesh had killed at least a dozen known militants since the restaurant siege. \u201cThe way we see it, looking at the number of people we\u2019ve arrested, and then adding that up with the number of people who have been killed in our raids, of course the militants\u2019 operation is weaker,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562664.665368}
