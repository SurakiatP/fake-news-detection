The next night, the roughly   hall would be packed, the rock band\u2019s first headlining concert appearance since, well, pretty much ever, but in rehearsal the band\u2019s only audience was stagehands and lighting techs. After plowing through the crunching riffs of \u201cPushin Forward Back,\u201d however, something didn\u2019t sound quite right. \u201cI don\u2019t think we go into that long of a breakdown on the record,\u201d said the guitarist Stone Gossard, noting the extended solo by his fellow guitarist, Mike McCready. \u201cI\u2019ll solo all night,\u201d Mr. McCready admitted. After a brief discussion, the musicians set down their instruments and huddled in front of the drummer Matt Cameron\u2019s kit, listening over a smartphone to the song as it appeared on their   1991 album, \u201cTemple of the Dog. \u201d Memories refreshed, they returned to their stations, and resumed pushing \u201cPushin Forward Back\u201d to its conclusion. Not that the band members are unfamiliar with one another: Mr. Gossard, Mr. McCready and Mr. Cameron, along with the bassist Jeff Ament, are all longtime members of Pearl Jam, while the singer Chris Cornell is known primarily for his work leading Soundgarden. Rather, it was the material that was somewhat alien, Mr. Gossard said during a conversation in the theater\u2019s dressing room, describing the challenge of \u201clearning songs that we literally played maybe 10 times 25 years ago. \u201d Despite the rust, tickets for the group\u2019s first tour, eight shows in five cities (including Madison Square Garden on Monday night) sold out in minutes, all the more remarkable for a band, as Mr. Cameron points out, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t exist. \u201d Temple of the Dog was originally convened a   ago, in tribute to their friend and colleague Andrew Wood, lead singer of the Seattle bands Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone, who died in March 1990 of a heroin overdose shortly before the release of Mother Love Bone\u2019s debut album, \u201cApple. \u201d At the band\u2019s inception, Soundgarden was preparing for its second major label album and Pearl Jam was just beginning to coalesce. To help deal with his grief, Mr. Cornell had written two songs, \u201cSay Hello 2 Heaven\u201d and \u201cReach Down,\u201d in which he tried to channel Mr. Wood\u2019s influence. \u201cI thought, well, this is one thing that I can do to remind myself and maybe other people of who this guy is and was and keep his story and in a way his life with us,\u201d Mr. Cornell said. He made demos of the songs, and approached Mr. Ament and Mr. Gossard, both of whom had been in Mother Love Bone with Mr. Wood, about properly recording them. The project soon evolved into an entire album, with the trio joined by Mr. Cameron, Soundgarden\u2019s drummer, and Mr. McCready, a childhood friend of Mr. Gossard\u2019s. \u201cI think that was a healing process for us all and you can certainly still hear it in the record,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. The name Temple of the Dog came from a lyric by Mr. Wood in the Mother Love Bone song \u201cMan of Golden Words\u201d (also on the set list for the current tour). The group played two short opening sets in Seattle in 1990, and has occasionally performed Temple of the Dog songs with Mr. Cornell at Pearl Jam concerts, but otherwise the band has never played together live since recording the album. \u201cIt was never intended to be like a big promoted rock record,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. AM released the   album in April 1991 and 70, 000 copies sold that year, but not until 1992 did sales explode. After the   success of Pearl Jam\u2019s debut, \u201cTen,\u201d and Soundgarden\u2019s \u201cBadmotorfinger,\u201d AM reissued \u201cTemple of the Dog\u201d and promoted the video for \u201cHunger Strike,\u201d featuring the band and the Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really get that broad attention,\u201d Mr. Cornell said, \u201cuntil someone at MTV put it together that \u2018Oh, there\u2019s this one video that we have that has members of both bands in it let\u2019s play it all day! \u2019\u201d \u201cHunger Strike\u201d shot up the charts and the album went platinum, but a tour for Temple at the time would have been \u201cimpossible,\u201d Mr. Cornell said, given the busy road schedules of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam. \u201cYou had to be out there beating the drum all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s sort of a luxury. It\u2019s a different world and a different time in the life spans of our respective bands, where we\u2019ve written our own tickets, we sort of do whatever we want, so we\u2019re fortunate that we can do this now. \u201d The current tour is accompanied by the recent release of a \u201c25th Anniversary Mix\u201d of the album, available in several permutations, including a   CD, DVD and   collection. Also arriving this week is a Mother Love Bone box set, \u201cOn Earth as It Is: The Complete Works\u201d (on the Pearl   Monkeywrench label) offering a new opportunity to examine the talents of Mr. Wood, a flamboyant figure in the Seattle scene who idolized Freddie Mercury, Paul Stanley and Elton John. \u201cHe had this way of looking at life that just made you laugh while you were around him,\u201d Mr. Gossard said. Mr. Cornell was Mr. Wood\u2019s roommate for about a year during the late 1980s in a dilapidated   house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle perched right over Interstate 5. The freeway noise was so loud it permitted Soundgarden and Malfunkshun to rehearse in the living room. \u201cWe had bands that were influenced by each other,\u201d Mr. Cornell said, \u201cand there was kind of a rivalry between us as songwriters, but literally like five feet apart  \u2014   through the doors to the bedrooms we could hear each other. \u201d In the lyrics to \u201cReach Down,\u201d Mr. Cornell depicted Mr. Wood \u201cwearing a long white leather   Purple glasses and glitter in your hair. \u201d \u201cThere was an aspect of him that was always performing all the time,\u201d Mr. Cornell said. \u201cHe had sort of invented himself as this character. The first time I ever saw him he had this entourage. He was a rock star, really, because he was it didn\u2019t have anything to do with anything else. \u201d The idea of a Temple reunion began percolating around five years ago, during Pearl Jam\u2019s 20th anniversary festival, after Mr. Cornell joined the other musicians onstage (Mr. Cameron having signed up as Pearl Jam\u2019s drummer in 1998) to play five Temple songs. It took a while to coordinate schedules, but time has finally been set aside. \u201cI always think about where Andy would want these songs to be played,\u201d Mr. Ament said. \u201cThe Garden and the Forum were like the two places he probably wanted to play more than anywhere, so from that standpoint it\u2019s awesome. \u201d Mr. Cameron hopes the reissues and the tour can elevate Mr. Wood\u2019s presence in the legacy of Seattle\u2019s music scene. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a footnote in our history,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cHe was a real big influence for us all. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563882.0965576}
