At stake are the spoils of a   industry and a minority group\u2019s ability to retain its customs in a   China. Also, noodles. When Xian Gulin opened a halal restaurant in Shanghai last month that serves   beef noodles, he hoped patrons would line up at his door. What he got instead was an entrance blocked for weeks by protesters. The protesters, like Mr. Xian, were Hui, a Muslim ethnic minority, originally from China\u2019s northwest. They accused the restaurateur of violating the    Treaty, a social pact that prohibits the Hui from opening halal noodle shops within 400 meters of each other  \u2014   roughly 1, 300 feet. To appease the protesters, Mr. Xian eventually agreed to take down the halal insignia from his storefront. The origins of the treaty are unknown, but restaurateurs say it originally capped the number of noodle shops in a Hui village at one. As more Hui began moving eastward into China\u2019s growing coastal cities, they brought a variant of the treaty with them. \u201cFor the Hui as a community, maintaining their halal traditions and restaurants has been critical to their survival, so it\u2019s not surprising that in a highly capitalized society, these rivalries would bubble to the surface,\u201d said Dru Gladney, an anthropology professor at Pomona College in California and an expert on Chinese ethnic minorities. The halal food industry has flourished in China as the country has pursued closer economic relations with   Middle Eastern nations. In Qinghai Province alone, sales of halal food products in 2014 totaled about $2. 8 billion. On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, online commenters condemned the protests. Even the Islamic Association of Qinghai got involved, declaring the boycott of Mr. Xian\u2019s restaurant a violation of \u201cfair competition\u201d that caused \u201csocial instability. \u201d Still, Hui restaurateurs insist that the treaty is more necessary than ever. \u201cWe worked so hard to climb our way up, so we can\u2019t tolerate people who do not respect the treaty,\u201d said Ma Yi Buo La, 37, who owns a halal noodle shop in Shanghai. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t abide by the treaty, they\u2019re not good people,\u201d he said. Yet enforcement of the treaty is increasingly difficult as halal cuisine becomes more popular across China. \u201cIt was a tradition in our villages back home, but I don\u2019t think anyone really respects this treaty anymore in large cities,\u201d said Ma Kefu, 19, a Gansu native who now works at a halal restaurant in Beijing. To make his point, he gestured across the street. No more than 15 feet away stood another halal restaurant, its intricate halal insignia prominently on display.'"}, "time": 1742628332.6702187}
