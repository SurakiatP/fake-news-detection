[\u201cI said a long time ago that NATO had problems,\u201d Trump said during the interview with the Times of London and Germany\u2019s Bild. \u201cNumber one, it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago. Number two, the countries weren\u2019t paying what they\u2019re supposed to pay. \u201d  Trump expanded on the latter point by explaining that \u201ccountries aren\u2019t paying their fair share so we\u2019re supposed to protect countries but a lot of these countries aren\u2019t paying what they\u2019re supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States. \u201d Specifically, he said Britain was one of five countries \u201cpaying what they\u2019re supposed to,\u201d out of 22 members. Trump nonetheless stressed that NATO is \u201cvery important to me,\u201d and that he feels \u201cvery strongly toward Europe,\u201d comments that appear to have been omitted from or dismissed by many reports on the interview by American and European media outlets. Another part of Trump\u2019s remarks quoted by very few outlets reporting the Times and Bild interview is his stern criticism of Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria. Monday\u2019s Twitter streams are filled with mockery of Trump as a Russian pawn or collaborator, because the Russians swiftly agreed with his description of NATO as \u201cobsolete,\u201d but he was quite tough on what they have been doing to Syria: Nah, I think it\u2019s a very rough thing. It\u2019s a very bad thing, we had a chance to do something when we had the line in the sand and it wasn\u2019t  \u2014   nothing happened. That was the only time  \u2014   and now, it\u2019s sort of very late. It\u2019s too late. Now everything is over  \u2014   at some point it will come to an end  \u2014   but Aleppo was nasty. I mean when you see them shooting old ladies walking out of town  \u2014   they can\u2019t even walk and they\u2019re shooting \u2019em  \u2014   it almost looks like they\u2019re shooting \u2019em for sport  \u2014   ah no, that\u2019s a terrible  \u2014   that\u2019s been a terrible situation. Aleppo has been such a terrible humanitarian situation. He followed this up by saying he trusts German Chancellor Angela Merkel as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin, \u201cbut let\u2019s see how long that lasts, it may not last long at all. \u201d He was responding to a question about whether he understands the historical importance of NATO to Europeans, and their continuing apprehension about Russia, when he described the alliance as \u201cobsolete. \u201d He was not saying there is no need for caution or defense against Russia he was saying NATO, as currently constructed and funded, is not the ideal tool for the job. CNN writes that Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov \u201cagreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of NATO\u201d by saying \u201cthe systematic goal of this organization is confrontation. \u201d That is not what Trump said, but apparently the media had decided any and all attacks on NATO, from everyone, constitute agreement with Trump. Various levels of pushback and panic fill the bulk of CNN\u2019s article, including the   German Foreign Minister,   Steinmeier, portraying the alliance as \u201crattled\u201d by Trump\u2019s remarks, and relaying \u201cconcerns\u201d from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. \u201cA strong NATO is good for the United States, just as it is for Europe,\u201d declared NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu. CBS News cites French Foreign Minister   Ayrault calling for Europeans to \u201cstay united, together as a bloc\u201d in response to Trump\u2019s remarks. AFP describes Chancellor Merkel\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s comments as \u201csharp,\u201d but she merely said, \u201cWe Europeans have our fate in our own hands. \u201d \u201cI am personally waiting for the inauguration of the U. S. president. Then of course we will work with him on all levels,\u201d she added. If that is a \u201csharp\u201d response, then Trump has already won his political struggle with Europe, and he is not even sworn in yet. Europe \u201ctaking its fate in its own hands\u201d appears to be what Trump wants when he objects that the NATO burden on the United States is too high. Europe reeks of obsolescence right now, far beyond NATO headquarters. If the election of Donald Trump jolts Europe\u2019s leaders into action, then American voters have done the people of Britain and the Continent a huge favor.'"}, "time": 1742563676.3716202}
