President Obama commuted most of the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, the army intelligence analyst sentenced to 35 years in prison for giving a massive trove of secret documents to WikiLeaks. Ms. Manning, already jailed for nearly seven years, will be freed in May. That rescues Ms. Manning, who has tried to commit suicide twice in prison, from an uncertain future as a transgender woman in a male prison. A White House spokesman stressed the differences between Ms. Manning\u2019s clemency application and the pardon application of Edward Snowden, the security contractor who disclosed archives of top secret surveillance files and is living in exile in Russia. _____ 2.   Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, is on Capitol Hill this week for his Senate confirmation hearing. He\u2019ll face hard questions over his trades of medical stocks. If confirmed, he\u2019ll lead the effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act. A new report from the Congressional Budget Office said the repeal would cost 18 million people their insurance in the first year. _____ 3. Nigerian fighter jets hunting for Boko Haram militants mistakenly bombed a refugee camp. The medical organization Doctors Without Borders said at least 52 people were killed and 200 injured. \u201cThis   attack on vulnerable people who have already fled from extreme violence is shocking and unacceptable,\u201d said an official with the group. _____ 4. A sense of uncertainty is taking hold around the globe as the U. S. prepares for the inauguration of Mr. Trump on Friday. The predictably unpredictable   upset the leaders of China and various European nations with provocative comments in newly published interviews. The inauguration and related events could cost more than $200 million  \u2014   possibly more than half of it for security. In Washington, which Mr. Trump calls \u201cthe swamp\u201d and where 91 percent of voters went for Hillary Clinton, \u201c  panic\u201d is setting in. _____ 5. Britain\u2019s leader backed a clean break from the European Union, its single market and its court system. In a   speech on \u201cBrexit,\u201d Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted a \u201cnew and equal partnership\u201d with European nations that would allow Britain to regain control of immigration. _____ 6. The Turkish authorities say the Uzbek man accused of killing 39 people at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year\u2019s Day, above, confessed after being captured. The Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack. And the widow of Omar Mateen, who pledged allegiance to Islamic State as he killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub last year, appeared in court. She is charged with aiding and abetting in the attack, and obstructing the investigation. _____ 7. Almost three years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board, officials called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean, the largest and costliest search in aviation history. Relatives of those lost were distraught. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine living the rest of my life accepting that people just disappeared into thin air,\u201d said a woman whose mother was on board. Above, debris was recovered on an island near Madagascar in 2015. _____ 8. We visited the Office of Presidential Correspondence, where a small army of employees and interns read the letters sent by millions of Americans to President Obama. There are tales of woe, joy, pleas for pardons or help with medical bills, a teenager\u2019s report card  \u2014   all sorts of writings. The team sifts through them, and hands Mr. Obama 10 to read each night. And in the last installment of our   series on Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy, we took a look at how the presidency changed him. _____ 9. A small triangular pendant found during the excavation of a Nazi death camp has intrigued Anne Frank experts. It\u2019s engraved with the words \u201cgood luck\u201d in Hebrew. Researchers determined that it likely belonged to a    girl: Karoline Cohn, born in Frankfurt in 1929. It was almost identical to one owned by Anne, who was born there the same year. Now they\u2019re trying to determine if the girls could have been friends, or even relatives. _____ 10. Finally, Americans tend to take less time off than their counterparts in industrialized countries. One survey found the average respondent took 12 vacation days when they had 15. (In Spain, they were 30 for 30.) \u201cGuilt and worry\u201d were common rationales. So here are some tips to make sure you take that break you earned: plan early, get organized, and remember what you\u2019re owed. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
