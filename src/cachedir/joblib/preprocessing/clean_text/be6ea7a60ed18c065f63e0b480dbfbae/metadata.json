The organization said it wants the event to \u201csend a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women\u2019s rights are human rights. \u201d Earlier this week, singers Katy Perry and Cher and actresses Scarlett Johansson, Zendaya, Debra Messing, and Julianne Moore were announced as being expected to participate in the January 21 event. Ugly Betty actress America Ferrera, chair of the organization\u2019s \u201cartist table,\u201d said the march is about standing up to the incoming administration. \u201cSince the election, so many fear that their voices will go unheard,\u201d Ferrera said in a statement. \u201cAs artists, women, and most importantly dedicated Americans, it is critical that we stand together in solidarity for the protection, dignity, and rights of our communities. Immigrant rights, worker rights, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, racial justice and environmental rights are not special interests, they affect us all and should be every American\u2019s concern. \u201d The Material Girl is just the latest star to come out in support of the event. The    Rebel Heart singer spent months slamming Trump\u2019s campaign, while drumming up support for Hillary Clinton. In October, Madonna famously offered oral sex to anyone who voted for the former Democratic nominee. Last month, Madonna admitted that Trump\u2019s election left her \u201cdevastated. \u201d \u201cIt felt like a  combination of the heartbreak and betrayal you feel when someone you love more than anything leaves you, and also a death,\u201d the singer told Billboard. \u201cI feel that way every morning I wake up and say, \u2018Oh, wait, Donald Trump is still the president,\u2019 and it wasn\u2019t a bad dream that I had. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742563972.869111}
