Bannon to Abu Bakr   the leader of the   Islamic State (ISIS, or ISIL) terrorist \u201ccaliphate. \u201d[The editorial argues that Bannon is like   because both perceive a \u201cclash of civilizations between Islam and the West. \u201d  (The term \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d arises from a 1992 lecture by Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington.) USA Today argues: Each man spins a narrative for his followers of sprawling conflict between believers of Prophet Mohammed and followers of Jesus Christ. \u201cThere is a major war brewing, a war that\u2019s already global,\u201d Bannon warned an audience at the Vatican in 2014. A year later, Baghdadi said: \u201cOh Muslims   \u2026     this war is only against you and against your religion. \u201d Each man proselytizes for this vision of war. A decade ago, according to The Washington Post, Bannon outlined a movie proposal based on the fear that radical Muslims will overrun the U. S. turning it into the \u201cIslamic States of America. \u201d Bannon and the ISIS leader, USA Today argues, are also similar because Bannon is a \u201cpopulist\u201d who \u201cseeks to upend the establishment and thrives on chaos. \u201d The editorial argues that the only way to hold Bannon in check is through \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s    vanity,\u201d which \u201ccould become a welcome force for peace\u201d if he feels upstaged by Bannon and reduces his influence. USA Today printed a short opposing view, written by Paul Miller of the Haym Salomon Center. He points out that USA Today itself conducted an \u201cexhaustive\u201d investigation of Bannon\u2019s past radio broadcasts \u201conly to find nothing\u201d  \u2014   none of the racism and antisemitism that the mainstream media had falsely concocted over the past several months. Miller adds: Since   two administrations told the public, \u201cIslam is peace. \u201d President Obama refused to even acknowledge that Islam, which means \u201csubmission\u201d or \u201csurrender,\u201d has anything to do with the wave of   terrorism in Europe and creeping its way into the United States. The Trump administration and Bannon do not mince words. And the fact that terrorism is uppermost on so many Americans\u2019 minds indicates a compelling vote of confidence for Bannon and President Trump, although one would be   to read that in the news media. In 2016, USA Today made an exception to its policy of not endorsing presidential candidates, and told its readers not to vote for Trump, arguing that he was \u201cunfit for the presidency. \u201d Joel B.
