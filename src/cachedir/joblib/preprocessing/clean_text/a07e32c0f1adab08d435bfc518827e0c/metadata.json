However, in a moment of blunt candor and honesty, Libertarian candidate for President Gary Johnson spoke for all of us when he openly mourned the loss of majestic Harambe. \\n\u201cWhy did they have to kill the gorilla?\u201d Johnson lamented in an exclusive interview with Independent Journal Review. \\nThe former New Mexico Governor and nature enthusiast was visibly moved when asked about his feelings on Harambe, a celebrated Western Lowlands Gorilla living peacefully in the Cincinnati Zoo before he was cruelly cut down in the prime of his life after a child fell into his enclosure this past May. \u201cI'm sure it was a difficult decision for everyone involved,\u201d Johnson said before ultimately bemoaning the cruel fate of the endangered, peaceful animal. \\nHarambe's legacy has become a cultural and even political phenomenon. Green Party candidate Jill Stein has tweeted her defense of sweet Harambe and there is now an official Harambe Super PAC registered with the FEC called 'Justice For Harambe.' \\nThe Super PAC's creator Ryan Hall spoke with IJR last month describing what his PAC will be committed to doing: \\nWe will endorse any candidate who is willing to honor Harambe's legacy. Harambe represents all Americans and what it truly means to be an American. We will back candidates who will work toward legislation which ensures that innocent gorillas can live in peace and not be shot. We want candidates who support safe enclosures for majestic gorillas. We also will support candidates who will fight for nationwide Harambe memorials, so our children may learn the story of his life. \\nWe have reached out to Hall to see if the PAC, which had raised $20 at last reporting, would now be backing Gov. Johnson's Presidential run. \""}, "time": 1742564130.4704576}
