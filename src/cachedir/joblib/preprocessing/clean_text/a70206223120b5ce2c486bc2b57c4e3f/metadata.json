[\u201cMaybe CNN gets a short term bump from the attention,\u201d David Shuster, the former MSNBC anchor, who once worked for CNN President Jeff Zucker, told the Hill. \u201cBut the long term damage to CNN, and the boost to Trump, could be significant. He\u2019s winning this. \u201d  Last week, CNN dedicated massive amounts of airtime to memos alleging that there was communication between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russian officials. Numerous allegations in the report, which Trump dubbed \u201cfake news,\u201d have since been found to be false: FAKE NEWS  \u2014   A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017,  Trump himself has said he believed CNN\u2019s coverage of him would become fair after he beat Hillary Clinton, but he noticed that it had, instead, gotten \u201cworse. \u201d \u201cI thought that CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!\u201d he wrote in November, a few weeks after the election. \u201cCNN is so embarrassed by their total (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Trump also wrote on Twitter. Trump\u2019s loyal supporters had also taken notice of what they thought was CNN\u2019s biased coverage of the Republican nominee. In October, about a month before Election Day, for example, more than 10, 000 Trump supporters chanted \u201cCNN sucks\u201d during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania for   Trump. Supporters shout \u201dCNN sucks\u201d during @realDonaldTrump rally in PA @BreitbartNews pic. twitter.   \u2014   Alex Swoyer, esq. (@ASwoyer) October 11, 2016,  \u201cIf there is one thing we know for sure about Donald Trump, it\u2019s that he can hold a grudge. Just ask Rosie O\u2019Donnell or Graydon Carter,\u201d media analyst Brian Flood told the Hill. \u201cIt would probably take Jeff Zucker heading to Trump Tower to kiss the ring to squash the whole thing,\u201d Flood added. \u201cCitizen Trump would hold a grudge for life, but   Trump has shown he\u2019s willing to meet with anyone under the right circumstances. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.'"}, "time": 1742628460.711062}
