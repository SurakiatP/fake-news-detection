It\u2019s unlikely that the famous golfer knows the former portfolio manager for Diamondback Capital Management, a hedge fund based in Stamford, Conn. that went out of business in 2013. But Mickelson ought to consider reaching out to thank him. Newman is quite likely a key reason Mickelson was not charged Thursday with insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Newman and another hedge fund manager, Anthony Chiasson, were indicted in 2012 on insider trading charges by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. (The S. E. C. also brought civil charges.) Newman was accused of regularly receiving information about two stocks  \u2014   Dell, the computer company, and Nvidia, a chip maker  \u2014   from company insiders, allowing him to make what amounted to illegal trades. When Newman was convicted of the charges in December 2012, he appeared to be just another Wall Street scalp for federal prosecutors, part of their aggressive, continuing effort to crack down on insider trading. In all, some 71 people had either pleaded guilty or been convicted of insider trading by Bharara\u2019s office by the time Newman was found guilty. (Chiasson was also convicted.) But then something strange happened  \u2014   or at least it seemed strange to those who had assumed that Bharara and the S. E. C. would continue to rack up insider trading convictions. In 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned Newman\u2019s conviction (and Chiasson\u2019s too) and tossed the original indictments. In effect, the appeals court ruled that Newman had not been guilty of insider trading. Why? Because, the court said, for a crime to have been committed, the company insider  \u2014   the   tipper  \u2014   had to have received a personal benefit in return for offering up inside information. In addition, the person who received the tip  \u2014   the \u201ctippee\u201d  \u2014   had to know that the tipper was receiving that personal benefit. By all appearances, Newman didn\u2019t even know who the tippers were the information got to him through a series of intermediaries, the last of whom was an analyst at Diamondback. Without that knowledge of a personal benefit, Newman had not committed a crime. Critics of the appeals court\u2019s Newman decision, including Bharara, say that the judges essentially redefined what constituted insider trading, making it much more difficult to bring cases even when it is obvious that wrongful behavior has taken place. Defenders, including many lawyers in the   defense bar, say the court was simply reiterating the law as the Supreme Court had always intended it to be, and was finally reining in overly aggressive prosecutions by Bharara. Whichever the case, the Newman decision sent an unmistakable message: \u201cIt told prosecutors they had to be cautious,\u201d said Peter J. Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University who writes the White Collar Watch column for DealBook in The New York Times. \u201cIt has had a chilling effect. \u201d With that context, let\u2019s take a closer look at what the government said about Phil Mickelson\u2019s behavior when it announced its indictment of his friend William T. Walters, a Las Vegas businessman and successful sports gambler. The facts, as laid out by the S. E. C. are not pretty. (Mickelson is not mentioned in the indictment, only in the S. E. C. \u2019s civil charges against Walters.) Walters, the government said, had been trading for years on insider information provided by Thomas C. Davis, a retired investment banker who was the chairman of Dean Foods. For a number of months in the spring and summer of 2012, Davis had been engaged in confidential Dean Foods board discussions about spinning off its organic food subsidiary, WhiteWave, a move Wall Street was encouraging. Davis  \u2014   who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the government  \u2014   had kept Walters informed about the discussions, and Walters had loaded up on the stock in anticipation of the spinoff. At the time, Mickelson owed Walters gambling debts. Although he was a serious gambler, Mickelson was not a big stock trader, with only about $250, 000 in the market, according to the S. E. C. Yet on July 30 and 31, 2012, after a series of phone calls and texts with Walters, Mickelson bought $2. 4 million worth of Dean Foods stock  \u2014   some of it with money he borrowed. \u201cThese were his first ever Dean Foods purchases,\u201d the S. E. C. noted. You know, of course, what happened next: A week later, Dean Foods announced the WhiteWave spinoff. The stock jumped 40 percent. The very next day, Mickelson sold his Dean Foods stock, reaping a profit of $931, 000. The case against Walters, as outlined by the S. E. C. and the United States attorney\u2019s office, appears to be strong. In all, the government says, the inside information Walters got from Davis was worth $40 million. The government goes out of its way to play up the personal benefit Davis received in return. An inveterate gambler trying to keep up an unsustainable lifestyle, he owed money to the I. R. S. and others, including Walters. More than once, Walters bailed him out by either lending him money or arranging for a loan. The loans totaled nearly $2 million. It is also clear that Walters, who is alleged to have tipped off Mickelson in turn, got a benefit from his tippee. According to the S. E. C. Mickelson used some of his Dean Foods profits to pay back his gambling debt to Walters. But did Mickelson know about the personal benefit the original tipper, Davis, was receiving? I know it sounds a little strange, but that really is the key legal question in the wake of the Newman decision. If he didn\u2019t know that Davis was receiving a personal benefit in return for giving inside information to Walters, he\u2019s off the hook. (A quick aside: According to Forbes, Mickelson has reaped around $500 million in career earnings, and gets some $50 million a year in endorsement income. The fact that he was trading in Dean Foods to repay a debt to Walters surely raises questions about Mickelson\u2019s financial   well apart from whether he traded on inside information.) In its complaint against Walters, the S. E. C. seems to have highlighted Mickelson\u2019s involvement in the case. But ultimately, it merely named him a \u201crelief defendant,\u201d meaning that all he had to do was return the money he had made from the Dean Foods trade, plus interest. He readily agreed. (The total is about $1. 03 million.) A spokesman for Mickelson issued a statement Thursday in which he said that Mickelson didn\u2019t want to \u201cbenefit from any transaction that the S. E. C. sees as questionable. \u201d He added that Mickelson regretted any \u201cappearance\u201d that he had fallen short of \u201cthe high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and Phil himself. \u201d That should do the trick: Several of the companies Mickelson endorses have already said they\u2019ll stick with him. For Mickelson, this too shall pass  \u2014   and probably pretty quickly. Still, given the set of facts laid out by the government, it\u2019s a little hard to believe that he didn\u2019t know what he was doing. The government won\u2019t explicitly say the Newman case caused the government to back away from bringing charges against Mickelson. But at his news conference on Thursday, after declining to comment on that very question, Bharara did say this: \u201cConduct we think is nefarious, and undermines faith in the market and the fairness of the markets, will not be able to be prosecuted because of the Newman decision. \u201d On Thursday, Phil Mickelson became Exhibit A.'"}, "time": 1742564375.7112944}
