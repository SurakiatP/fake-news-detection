ALPERT \\nThe company that owns the National Enquirer, a backer of Donald Trump , agreed to pay $150,000 to a former Playboy centerfold model for her story of an affair a decade ago with the Republican presidential nominee, but then didn\u2019t publish it, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the matter. \\nThe tabloid-newspaper publisher reached an agreement in early August with Karen McDougal, the 1998 Playmate of the Year. American Media Inc., which owns the Enquirer, hasn\u2019t published anything about what she has told friends was a consensual romantic relationship she had with Mr. Trump in 2006. At the time, Mr. Trump was married to his current wife, Melania. \\nQuashing stories that way is known in the tabloid world as \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d In a written statement, the company said it wasn\u2019t buying Ms. McDougal\u2019s story for $150,000, but rather two years\u2019 worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers as well as exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then-married man. \u201cAMI has not paid people to kill damaging stories about Mr. Trump,\u201d the statement said. \\nMs. McDougal expected her story about Mr. Trump to be published, people familiar with the matter said. American Media didn\u2019t intend to run it, said another person familiar with the matter. Ms. McDougal didn\u2019t return calls for comment. \\nRead more at WSJ Related Posts: Afraid of What?
