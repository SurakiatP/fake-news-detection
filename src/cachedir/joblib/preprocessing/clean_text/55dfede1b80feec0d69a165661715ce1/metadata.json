[\u201cThe press has become so dishonest that if we don\u2019t talk about [it] we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people,\u201d Trump said during his press conference in the East Room. \u201cWe have to talk to find out what\u2019s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. \u201d  Trump said he wanted to take his message \u201cstraight to the people,\u201d as the cable news programs ran his entire hour and seventeen minute press conference live. The president went back and forth with network and cable news reporters representing news companies that have spent the majority of their energies disparaging the president and his performance during the first weeks of his presidency. Trump specifically cited CNN for their negative coverage of his administration. \u201cI watch CNN, it\u2019s so much anger and hatred, and  \u2014   just the hatred,\u201d he said, calling the negative coverage \u201cfake news. \u201d \u201cI turn on the T. V. open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos. Chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cYet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   machine, despite the fact that I can\u2019t get my cabinet approved. \u201d Trump lashed out at Democrats, asserting that he had inherited a mess from former President Obama, and criticized them for trying to stall his presidency. \u201cThe only thing they can do is delay, because they screwed things up royally,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628393.2987914}
