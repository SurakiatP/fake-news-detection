This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies. \\nAs I\u2019ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities. I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly. \\nI also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud. I'll be an independent observer at the U.S. #Elections2016 I call on other hackers to monitor the elections from inside the system \\n\u2014 GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) November 4, 2016 This is a movement \u2013 we are the political OUTSIDERS fighting against the FAILED GLOBAL ESTABLISHMENT!
