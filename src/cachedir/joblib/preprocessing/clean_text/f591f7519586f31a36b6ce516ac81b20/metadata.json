A cemetery finally opened last year, and 40 residents are buried there, most dead of natural causes after long and peaceful lives. That is to say, there is nothing temporary about this place, one of the closest settlements to Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, which Israel seized from Jordan 50 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s part of Jerusalem,\u201d said Sima Weiss, 58, who has lived here 30 years, raised three children and works a cleaning job just 20 minutes away by bus in the holy city proper. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a settler. \u201d The world has focused more critically recently on Israel\u2019s settlements in occupied territory, after last month\u2019s United Nations declaration  \u2014   which the United States tacitly supported  \u2014   that they are killing the dream of one state for Jews, one for Palestinians. Many Israelis argue that Ma\u2019ale Adumim  \u2014   a city of 41, 000 with filled schools, a largely secular civic pride and skittish stray cats  \u2014   is a special case: Its closeness to Jerusalem has put it near the top of the list of settlements Israelis say they could swap for other land in a peace deal. Yet Ma\u2019ale Adumim has become a flash point of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.   politicians, emboldened by a more sympathetic Trump administration, want to annex it to Israel proper  \u2014   the first formal annexation of a settlement. Supporters of the move argue that in the long absence of negotiations, Israel cannot stand still, and Ma\u2019ale Adumim would likely be a part of Israel in any case. \u201cClearly it\u2019s time for a quantum change,\u201d Naftali Bennett, the education minister, who plans to introduce the annexation bill, said in an interview. \u201cThe incremental approach has not worked. We have to understand it\u2019s a new reality. We have to go big, bold and fast. \u201d The Parliament seems poised to approve a law that few thought had any chance of passage just a few months ago: It would ultimately legalize settlement homes built illegally on private Palestinian land. Critics call this yet another form of creeping annexation. Many Palestinians agree this is a critical moment. They fear Ma\u2019ale Adumim will be just the beginning of the annexation of settlements in the West Bank, now home to roughly 400, 000 Jews, and the end of the   dream. \u201cWe believe in two states for two nations, but if they took that\u201d  \u2014   Ma\u2019ale Adumim  \u2014   \u201cthere will be no longer two states,\u201d said Yousef Mostafa Mkhemer, chairman of the Organization of Jerusalem Steadfastness, which focuses on issues like Muslim holy sites, refugee camps and Israeli settlements. \u201cThere will be one state called Israel. \u201d Many Palestinians and peace activists argue that the line has already been crossed  \u2014   that any annexation of Ma\u2019ale Adumim, after so many years, would be a technicality. \u201cWe are living in one state now,\u201d said Ziad Abu Zayyad, a Palestinian lawyer and writer. Mr. Zayyad, a former Palestinian minister, said that unlike most Palestinians he supported Donald J. Trump for president, in part because he felt his apparently greater sympathy for Israel would begin to provide a clarity to a   conflict. \u201cI want to see a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fed up. \u201d \u201cHe could be a big devil. He could be something good. My point is he will make a change, for the good or for the bad. \u201d There are signs, in fact, that the conflict here is already shifting, with Ma\u2019ale Adumim near the center, no matter how quiet and workaday its residents think themselves (70 percent of residents commute to Jerusalem proper for their jobs). After eight years of little building, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just allotted 100 new building units to Ma\u2019ale Adumim, part of 2, 500 new proposed housing units around the West Bank settlements, and another 560 in East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyanu has proclaimed this as just the beginning of a new wave of building. Less than a month after the United Nations resolution, the city\u2019s mayor, Benny Kashriel, and another settlement leader proudly attended Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. That would have been unthinkable for past incoming American presidents, out of fear it could be interpreted as an endorsement of settlements, which most of the world considers illegal. \u201cIt\u2019s a different policy,\u201d Mr. Kashriel, mayor for 25 years, said just a day back from Washington. He believes that the new administration sees places like Ma\u2019ale Adumim more benignly than did former President Barack Obama, whose administration blocked much building here and in the nearby E1, an especially contentious area closer to Jerusalem. \u201cWe didn\u2019t steal the land from anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was built on empty hills. You can see there  \u2014   the desert, rocks and sand. Now you have a living city. \u201d Much of the outside world\u2019s attention has focused on more religious settlements deeper into the West Bank or on land with Palestinian titles in more direct conflict with Palestinians. But here, scrutiny has been intense on Ma\u2019ale Adumim. It is partly symbolic: Israel has not annexed 1967 land beyond East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Opponents of the move fear it would be the start of a process that would not end until politicians like Mr. Bennett achieved their dreams of annexing large swaths of the West Bank and leaving the Palestinians with what Mr. Netanyahu recently called \u201ca  . \u201d It is partly strategic: The settlement is at the heart of entrenched plans to expand Jerusalem, linking it to the city proper, along with other nearby settlements that also function in practice as Jerusalem suburbs. One issue with Ma\u2019ale Adumim, critics argue, is its place in the West Bank, between north and south, that combined with other building plans could both hamper transit of Palestinians and threaten the contiguous borders of any future Palestinian state. The area is also not as empty as Ma\u2019ale Adumim\u2019s supporters say. Eid Abu Khamis, the leader of some 8, 000 Bedouins in the area, says harassment by Israel has increased recently. More of their makeshift housing has been torn down and land for their goats and sheep  \u2014   they sell meat, yogurt and cheese to survive  \u2014   declared  . Most of the Bedouins live in the E1 area, which is technically a part of Ma\u2019ale Adumim and is slated for some 3, 700 new housing units. The Obama administration staunchly opposed any development in E1 as a possible point of no return for a viable Palestinian state. \u201cIf the Bedouin are kicked out of this land where we have lived for 30 years, it will be the end of negotiations with the State of Israel,\u201d Mr. Khamis said. Many Palestinians argue that the annexation could ignite another round of violent revolt. A Palestinian flag was recently planted in a park in Ma\u2019ale Adumim here, a worrying sign for residents that the less expensive, less harried life in their suburb may change. \u201cI didn\u2019t come because I believe we should take all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River,\u201d said a    resident, a driver who would give his name only as Max S. \u201cIt was cheap. That\u2019s why I came. If I could change my apartment to an apartment in Tel Aviv, in a minute I would do it. \u201c People here are proud of what they have built since it was founded in 1975, with 15 religious Jews. There is a library, a theater, 15 schools and 78 kindergartens. It is mostly secular, but gets along with its more religious residents, about a quarter of the population. An industrial park, while the occasional target of the worldwide campaign to boycott goods made in settlements, is thriving and employs some 4, 000 Palestinians  \u2014   at much higher wages, the mayor notes, than they could earn in Palestinian areas. Ronit Jackov, 55, who works in the local mall (which is getting a new floor with five cinemas) said she favored annexation, largely so the city can begin to grow again after years of a building freeze. She said she would never move back to Jerusalem, in part because the city has become too religious and rigid. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable in a place where people tell you how to live,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to live their lives. \u201d And she places much hope in Mr. Trump, that he will side more forcefully with Israelis. \u201cI\u2019m not a very political person,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m waiting for him to carry out what he said, and I\u2019ll say, \u2018You are great.\u2019 Because the whole world is against us. We need someone on our side. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562161.7211494}
