What happens in the aftermath of \u201cBrexit,\u201d as it is known, is far from clear, but American travelers heading abroad will see some immediate effects. How does the Brexit vote affect Americans traveling to Europe and Britain? The most immediate effect is in the exchange rates between the dollar and the British pound, which has recorded its lowest rate in about 30 years after the results of the vote were published, providing American travelers a discount on prices paid throughout Britain. \u201cSince yesterday, you get a lot more bang for your buck in the U. K.,\u201d said Zach Honig, editor in chief at ThePointsGuy. com, which covers travel and incentives. \u201cFor lots of people, London is traditionally an expensive tourist destination, and with this shift the U. K. and specifically London probably are now within reach for a lot of U. S.  travelers. \u201d The dollar has also improved against the euro, making travel within countries using the euro cheaper. Is it a good time to book air travel? Yes, but it has been so for the last six weeks, according to George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog. com. \u201cAirfares to Europe have been plummeting, especially for late summer travel, after the college kids go back to school around Aug. 28 and onward,\u201d he said, noting that fares to Europe from the United States were appearing as low as $400 and $500    . \u201cIt may have been an anticipation of Brexit, but we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably also the fact that the euro and the pound were drifting lower, and that means that fewer people were flying from Europe to the U. S. and the airlines had to fill those seats with people flying from the U. S. to Europe. \u201d Two to three years ago, he said summer airfares to Europe were running in the $1, 800 range. Current deals, said Gary Leff, the author of the travel blog Viewfromthewing. com, are \u201ca function of some growth in capacity and some of the    seats on carriers like Norwegian. And it\u2019s what we all expected, with some lag, due to lower fuel prices. It\u2019s been inexpensive, and now it\u2019s inexpensive to be there, thanks to the currency. \u201d Will I get a better deal on a tour or package to Europe or Britain now? Maybe. It\u2019s early days, but if exchange rates hold and travel softens within Europe and Britain, expect more enticing travel offers. \u201cUsually when these things happen, the travel industry response is to bring people in,\u201d said Mike Stitt, the North American president of Travelzoo, a publisher of travel deals. \u201cThe real area I would watch for are vacation deals. There are packaging companies and tour operators who work with airlines and hotels and can put together strong deals to entice U. S. travelers. \u201d When these deals might surface is unknown but probably later this year, assuming exchange rates hold. Will my experience at the U. K. or European borders change as a result of Brexit? No. Americans must still present a valid passport when entering European   countries as well as Britain. When the dust settles and Britain is extracted from the European Union, which most believe will take some years, it is travelers from European and U. K. countries who may experience more hassles at foreign borders. One area of uncertainty is Northern Ireland. A member of the U. K. Northern Ireland shares a   border with the Republic of Ireland now. No passports are required for transit between the two countries, which, though both were members of the European Union, use different currencies. With Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, the Ireland and Northern Ireland border would now represent a frontier between the U. K. and the European Union, though what form that would take is unknown. As Ireland\u2019s Prime Minister Enda Kenny wrote in The Guardian this week, \u201cWhat is not easy to quantify and mitigate is the psychological effect of a hardening border on the island. My fear is that it would play into an old narrative  \u2014   one of division, isolation and difference. \u201d Will there be any effects felt in the travel industry in the United States? That\u2019s another unknown, but the decline of the pound relative to the dollar could affect incoming visitors from Britain who tend to visit popular destinations like New York, Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago. \u201cIf British tourists, because of currency fluctuations, change their plans or don\u2019t come to U. S. you may see some ability to get some better prices in some cities,\u201d said Mr. Stitt of Travelzoo. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a little of that effect now with the Canadian travelers. As their currency has plummeted against the dollar, Canadians are staying home. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563516.973167}
