One of those things is any needle into the muscle at all. \\nThe other thing left out of the acute flaccid paralysis conversation, is that it used t o be called \u201cpolio\u201d and thought to be caused by a virus called the polio virus, causing a syndrome named \u201cpoliomyelitis.\u201d \\nThe only problem is that different viruses and toxins can give the same results: poliomyelitis or flaccid paralysis. \\nMany people think we have done away with polio and iron lungs. But we haven\u2019t. The iron lung is now a much more efficient and sophisticated machine called the endotracheal ventilator. \\nIf you think that what is going on today with EV D-68 or any other numbered enterovirus, is new, please know that it is just history repeating itself because the people in charge of so-called \u201cpublic health\u201d seem to be completely out to lunch or bought when it comes to seeing the reality. \\nAsk yourself why we heard so much about zika and ebola and almost nothing about the reality of today\u2019s \u201cpolio.\u201d Hint: Which diseases have vaccines in development? \\nPolio was the second vaccine I researched on my quest to find the truth. I had to do it because so many people scoffed at my doubt over influenza vaccines, due to the supposed success of polio vaccines. Like all doctors, my knowledge of polio and any vaccines was very limited. \\nWhat I found floored me. \\nIf the history of polio and vaccines interests you, please read one chapter out of Dissolving Illusions , that is available free to you in PDF .'"}, "time": 1742562636.4054148}
