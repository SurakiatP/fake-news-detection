[\u201cMrs. Clinton employed more than 100 people in her digital team and spent tens of millions of dollars targeting millennials with a series of   messages on Facebook,\u201d reported the Telegraph on Monday. \u201cBut experts said she might have been better off buying newspaper or local TV adverts in the handful of key states she unexpectedly lost. \u201d  \u201cMrs. Clinton\u2019s digital team, sitting in their Brooklyn headquarters under a \u2018Swipe Right for Hillary\u2019 banner, were told to think \u2018out of the box\u2019 and appeal to young voters on social media, using outlets including Snapchat and Pinterest,\u201d it continued. \u201cA total of 30 young staff members were assigned to film her on the campaign trail and post the slickly edited videos on Facebook. \u201d Other projects that Clinton\u2019s campaign spent money on in an attempt to secure millennials included a   comic book series based on what they predicted a Donald Trump presidency would look like, while Facebook adverts took the top priority. \u201cHer big problem was not reaching working class voters in about three key states,\u201d said Justin Holmes, assistant professor of political science at the University of Iowa. \u201cWith social media you can target specific groups, but they were focused on young women and Latinos. \u201d \u201cIf anything, if the Clinton campaign had bought a few more ads in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin newspapers she might have won,\u201d added Holmes, who also claimed that the   rate of social media adverts were \u201cterrible\u201d and were only a way of \u201cpreaching to the choir. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of people who have already made up their minds. There is some value in mobilising people who already support you, but those other people are harder to reach,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWhat\u2019s a candidate supposed to do in the future? I don\u2019t know. \u201d In their report, The Telegraph also claimed that digital advertising \u201cmade up 14. 4 per cent of the total spent in 2016 compared to only 1. 7 per cent in 2012,\u201d adding around 40% of the budget, or $428 million, would have been spent on Facebook adverts. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say Facebook doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said political consultant Neil Oxman. \u201cI think it\u2019s better to have them than not have them  \u2026     But one of the reasons she didn\u2019t win was because she spent almost no money on traditional advertising in Wisconsin and Michigan. \u201d \u201cHillary Clinton should get all her money back. It didn\u2019t work,\u201d proclaimed Vanderbilt University Political Science Professor John Geer. \u201cAnyone who relies on     as a group, unfortunately, what we would call those candidates are losers. Because they never turn out. \u201d \u201cWe are in a situation where we should really   all the money they are pouring into these adverts because it seems crazy,\u201d he concluded. During Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, a PAC in her favor also paid over $1 million for internet trolls to scour the web and \u201ccorrect\u201d negative things said about Clinton online. In September, the same PAC also offered a paid bounty to anyone who had dirt on Trump. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
