But global policymakers, who continue to insist that there\u2019s more they can do to revive growth and inflation, are starting to sound like Monty Python\u2019s Black Knight (click link to see video), the limbless and mortally wounded warrior who threatens to bleed on his victorious opponent. The truth is that governments and central banks have very few weapons left \u2014 and have probably lost any chance they once had of averting a prolonged stagnation. \\nSecular Stagnation \\nClearly, the real economy hasn\u2019t responded as hoped to zero and now negative interest rates. A whole host of factors continue to depress personal spending \u2014 high debt, stagnant incomes, unemployment and under-employment, and economic uncertainty. Even the rich, who have benefited immensely from the runup in asset prices, can\u2019t really spend much more than they already are.\u201d \\nSatyajit Das is an Australian former banker and corporate treasurer, turned consultant, author and academic. His latest book is \u201cA Banquet of Consequences\u201d and he is also the author of \u201cExtreme Money\u201d and \u201cTraders, Guns & Money.\u201d \\nImportant article can be read on Bloomberg here \\nGold and Silver Bullion \u2013 News and Commentary'"}, "time": 1742562268.429898}
