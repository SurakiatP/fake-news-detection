RT The story broke in mid-June, when parents of a 13-year-old student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. \u201cWhat a trip to the mosque has to do with geography classes?\u201d Arthur Dent asked. Others compared the authorities\u2019 actions to the darkest part of German history, with one user tweeting: \u201cVisiting mosques is a top priority under our regime, similar to having a Fuhrer\u2019s image in everyone\u2019s flat.\u201d In a letter to the class teacher quoted by the NDR, the teen\u2019s father argued that his son would be \u201cindoctrinated\u201d in the mosque. He went on to say that \u201cfor years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.\u201d The parents\u2019 lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their son\u2019s \u201cbodily safety.\u201d Denying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that \u201cnobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.\u201d Heumann himself, however, is a former member of the Alternative for Germany party, an anti-immigrant political group, and was a participant in setting up the \u2018Dugida,\u2019 a Dusseldorf-based branch of the far-right PEGIDA movement. According to the NDR report, the parents met the lawyer through the \u2018Pax Europa\u2019 movement, a civic group which opposes the perceived \u201cIslamization of Europe.\u201d A local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of \u20ac300 ($328). When the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial.'"}, "time": 1742561853.3032494}
