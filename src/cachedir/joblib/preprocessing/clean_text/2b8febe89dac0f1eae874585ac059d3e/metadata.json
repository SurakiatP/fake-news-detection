[\u201cI\u2019m a free speech activist. This is not about free speech,\u201d Geller explained. \u201cLinda Sarsour is free to speak on college campuses and, by the way, frequently does. \u201d  \u201cWe are protesting the invitation by CUNY, City University of New York  \u2014   a   university, and by the way, with a student body that\u2019s over 25 percent Jewish  \u2014   of a vicious   a leader of the BDS movement, Boycott Divestment and Sanction of Israel movement, a supporter of sharia,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe idea that this was the best that CUNY could do, this is the role model that they are holding up to our children to emulate, is just obscene,\u201d Geller declared.  \u201cIf you look at history, this idea of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement, the inspiration was the German boycott of the German Jews, which preceded Kristallnacht, the economic boycott,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the same thing, and the Nazi boycott of the Jews was the antecedent to BDS. \u201d \u201cHere you have a woman, Linda Sarsour, who has said that Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Brigitte Gabriel deserve an   and should have their vaginas cut off,\u201d Geller said of Sarsour. \u201cShe has said that the Christmas Day underwear bomber who tried to blow up a plane on Christmas Day over Detroit was a CIA plot. We could go on and on. This is who CUNY University of New York is holding up as the example? She stands on a stage with a convicted terrorist who murdered Jews, Rasmea Odeh. She stands on a stage with her. Her family has been convicted of jihad terror. Her brother, I think, is still in jail. \u201d  \u201cI could go on and on,\u201d said Geller, before proceeding to do so. \u201cThere\u2019s a list of things. She has said nothing is creepier than Zionism, Israel is an apartheid state, Prime Minister Netanyahu is a waste of a human being and a racist, and on and on. She faked a hate crime against herself to score political points nationally by portraying a mentally ill black homeless man as a violent racist. By the way, everyone in the neighborhood knew the man and sort of likes the man. \u201d \u201cIt really was a disgusting display, a P. R. stunt  \u2014   which, by the way, she\u2019s very good at,\u201d Geller continued. \u201cWhen she supposedly raised money after there were hundreds of Jewish cemetery gravestones  \u2014   I think it was in Philly  \u2014   that were desecrated they\u2019re knocked over. She pulled off this publicity stunt, which, by the way, the media loves, to raise money to help restore the stones. She loves dead Jews, okay? Live ones, not so much. \u201d  \u201cSo yes, this Thursday at noon  \u2014   so if you\u2019re in New York, it\u2019s your lunch hour, no excuses!  \u2014   you come to the CUNY offices, which is 205 East 42nd street,\u201d she announced. \u201cWe\u2019re having a demonstration against the invitation of this       to give the keynote speech, when universities have disinvited Ayaan Hirsi Ali, disinvited Nonie Darwish, disinvited Ann Coulter. \u201d \u201cWe cannot sanction this. This is the mainstreaming. This is the norming of evil. This is the norming of \u201d she contended. \u201cMilo is coming in to speak  \u2014   yes, Milo!\u201d said Geller, referring to former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos. \u201cAssemblyman Dov Hikind is speaking. Nonie Darwish is flying in to speak. My friend Caroline Glick is giving me a statement. She\u2019s in Israel. John Guandolo, the counterterrorism expert and founder of Understanding the Threat is speaking. \u201d \u201cAmbassador John Bolton is trying to come in to speak,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have Lauri Regan for the Endowment for Middle East Truth and National Women\u2019s Committee [of the Republican Jewish Coalition]. We have David Wood, Acts 17 Apologetics. \u201d  \u201cYou have to come!\u201d she urged. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t come, what you\u2019re saying is you don\u2019t care. Silence is affirmation. \u201d  \u201cIt reminds of in the 1920s, Hitler\u2019s party. Before it was the National Socialist Workers\u2019 Party, it was the National Socialist Party  \u2014   and they were a violent group of rabble that were on the absolute fringe of German society,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey were not taken seriously. He had some popular following in the beer halls  \u2014   German white trash, as it were. He was nowhere. It was not until 1929 when a coalition of political parties invited him to join them in the German referendum of 1929 it was a referendum against the Versailles treaty. It was at that moment, in my estimation of studying history, where history turned, where you normed Hitler, where you sanctioned Hitler. You invited him to join the mainstream. Everything changed for him after that. \u201d \u201cThis is what I see happening now, where voices of freedom like myself and my colleagues are marginalized, demonized, and rendered radioactive  \u2014   and you norm a Linda Sarsour, who made her bones on the backs of Jews, who made her bones on  . That\u2019s her racket. \u201d  \u201cAnd for CUNY, whose student population is over 25 percent Jewish, to invite her to keynote the commencement on Shavuot they made it on a Jewish holiday!\u201d Geller exclaimed. \u201cThat\u2019s the Jewish holiday where God gave the Jews law, Jewish law. To make it on that day  \u2014   what are observant Jews supposed to do? Choose between Sarsour and Shavuot? The whole thing is vile and disgusting, and it needs to be opposed. \u201d Marlow suggested it was the provision of public funds for Sarsour\u2019s \u201c  garbage,   garbage\u201d that was supremely objectionable when so many other speakers have been turned away in recent years. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t find anyone better?\u201d Geller asked rhetorically. \u201cGo to Facebook. Just search \u2018Sarsour protest.\u2019 All the information is there. Bring signs. Bring your friends. Stand up. Show them we will not be steamrolled by this   alliance. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. '"}, "time": 1742562210.6043844}
