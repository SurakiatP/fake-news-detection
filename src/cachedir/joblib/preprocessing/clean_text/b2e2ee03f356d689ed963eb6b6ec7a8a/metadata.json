Obama stated on January 12, 2016 that, \u201clast year Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer.\u201d \\nI\u2019m not making light of this statement, and certainly not of Biden, for he lost his son Beau Biden to brain cancer in May of 2015. \\nObama continued by saying that, \u201clast month he [Biden] worked with Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health, the strongest resources they\u2019ve had in over a decade.\u201d He received a standing ovation from virtually ever member in the chamber. \\nThis is my problem. Not that Biden lost his son to cancer and wishes for no one else to suffer the way his son and family did. I get that. It\u2019s the way almost everyone in government proposes to solve the problem. It\u2019s always the same. The federal government ponies up billions of dollars of our money to fund quasi-government science projects, which rarely if ever accomplish anything. \\nHowever laudable this particular goal may be, it is not in the federal government\u2019s job description to be funding medical research. And to me, knowing the feds as I do \u2013 this seems to me to be another case of not letting a good crisis go to waste. \\nSome may say this is a jaded opinion and that Obama and Biden are trying to help cure cancer. How could I possibly be against that? I\u2019m not, of course \u2013 but I am jaded, and for good reason. I would love to see a cure for all cancers, but government involvement in everything invariably creates more problems than it ever solves. Not to mention that it is just another unconstitutional function. \\nObama then stated that because Biden has \"gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past forty years, I\u2019m puttin\u2019 Joe in charge of mission control.\u201d Really. Name three things ole-Joe has \u201cgone to mat\u201d for us on. Okay \u2013 how about two. \\nSo uncle Joe Biden, with his forty years in politics, and zero years in science or medicine, is heading the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force. Other members of the \u201cTask Force\u201d are from the Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Energy, Veteran Affairs, the OMB, National Economic Council, Domestic Policy Council. Others include the National Cancer Institute, Institutes of Health, and the National Science Foundation. \\nOkay \u2013 I get the science institutes \u2013 but why the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and others? What do they have to do with curing cancer? Answer \u2013 nothing \u2013 of course, but government task forces need lots of important people. They won\u2019t contribute anything useful, but it looks impressive. \\nSo, almost a year into the five year Task Force plan \u2013 how are things going? Have they made any progress \u2013 any breakthroughs? Nope. Joe is out making more speeches, as he did in June, exclaiming that \u201cthere is clear sense of \u2013 let\u2019s get it done now. We can do it now.\u201d That\u2019s a great sentiment, but having endless meetings and simply exclaiming the urgency will do absolutely nothing. \\nAnd then ole-Joe said something telling in his speech \u2013 something Joe does quite often. He said to the scientists in the audience: \u201cWe call for help and you all answer. You didn\u2019t need us to call. You were already doin it.\u201d \\nSo, if this is the case \u2013 and it is \u2013 why do we need this behemoth, billion dollar government taskforce? Why then do we need this collaboration between actual cancer research and government hacks like Biden and other bureaucrats? The answer is that this is what statists do. No matter what the cause, government always must inject itself and eventually take it over. \\nThat was June \u2013 six months in. A week ago, closing in on a year after the Moonshot announcement, Obama and Biden held a sit down to report on their progress. Obama stated that Joe has traveled the country and had multiple meetings \u201cin order to really figure out how we get this thing to achieve serious liftoff.\u201d Yes \u2013 almost a year in and they are still trying to figure how to begin the Moonshot. \\nObama then stated that, although they would be leaving office soon, what they leave behind is the framework for organizing these efforts. And that in a nutshell, is what the statist government progressive\u2019s goal always is \u2013 to build the framework for continual governmental meddling. Later on, they can get down to picking winners and losers, thus hindering real cancer research for those who would rather not play ball and tow the government line, just as it has done with climate science, energy, and many other disciplines. \\nWant to never cure another cancer? The best way to achieve this is to announce that we are from the government and are here to help, support and organize you.
