He and his mother, Alison Holmes, attended a Trump rally on Saturday to protest the GOP nominee\u2019s mockery of people with disabilities. As they were being removed from the rally by security, Trump\u2019s supporters began pushing and kicking the child\u2019s wheelchair. \\n\u201cThe crowd started chanting \u2018U-S-A\u2019 and pushing his wheelchair,\u201d Alison said. \u201cWe were put out by security. Mr. Trump kept saying, \u2018Get them out.\u2019\u201d \\n\u201cI hate Donald Trump. I hate Donald Trump,\u201d J.J. said through his vocalization device. \\nThe next day, J.J. and his mom got to meet the President of the United States after a rally for Hillary Clinton in Kissimmee, Florida. The experience was the polar opposite of what they had experienced the day before. \\nIf kicking a child\u2019s wheelchair isn\u2019t deplorable, I don\u2019t know what the hell is.
