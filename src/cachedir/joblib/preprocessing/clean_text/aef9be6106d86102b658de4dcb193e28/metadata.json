Adams then drove his tank through a set of gates beside some homeless people, positioned in such a way as to mimic the conditions outside Leinster House. \\nThe Republican party\u2019s attempt to overthrow the government will be made easier by the fact that, thanks to the garda strike, stretched and limited resources will be directed to stopping the Nation\u2019s criminals from robbing everyone\u2019s TVs from their homes. \\nIt is alleged that Adams\u2019s first action as Taoiseach post-coup would be to achieve a united Ireland, which no longer seems as controversial a prospect as it once was if a recent Irish News poll is anything to go by, which stated that 98% of people with Celtic tattoos would vote for a united Ireland.'"}, "time": 1742628469.1173031}
