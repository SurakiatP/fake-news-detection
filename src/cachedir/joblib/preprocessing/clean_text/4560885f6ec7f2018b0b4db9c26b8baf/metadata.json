For more than three decades, this was national policy in China. The IUD was the government\u2019s most important tool for limiting couples to one child, and almost all new mothers were required to get one. Ms. Lu, a former advertising executive, considered the demand invasive, insulting and potentially harmful to her health. Still, like hundreds of millions of Chinese women before her, she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in. Now, a year after abandoning the \u201c \u201d policy, the government is hoping to make it up to Ms. Lu and millions of women like her  \u2014   by removing their IUDs, free of charge. But the offer, made without even a hint of an apology, has provoked incredulous outrage. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t even have had this in the first place, and now the government wants to use it as a form of state benefit for people,\u201d Ms. Lu, 36, scoffed in a phone interview from her home in the eastern city of Linyi. \u201cIt\u2019s like they are slapping themselves in the face. \u201d While IUDs elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor\u2019s office, surgery is usually needed in China because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract, some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all. But many Chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government\u2019s getting involved, yet again, in their private lives. And for many mothers, the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound,\u201d said Zhang Xintian, 25, who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of Zhejiang to remove the IUD she had worn for more than two decades. In China, women often have the same IUD from soon after childbirth until menopause while popular IUDs in the United States are typically deemed effective for up to 10 years, those used in China offer birth control for much longer. China began demanding that women be fitted with an intrauterine device after they had one child, and sterilized after they had two, in the early 1980s. Those who refused risked that their children would be denied access to public schools and health insurance. Civil servants and state employees who refused lost their jobs. From 1980 to 2014, according to official statistics, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with IUDs. And 107 million underwent tubal ligations or, as is commonly said, got their \u201ctubes tied. \u201d Local officials were evaluated by their ability to meet targets, leading some to order that the procedures  \u2014   as well as abortions  \u2014   be performed by force on women who resisted. Then last year, confronting an aging population and a shrinking work force, President Xi Jinping relegated the   policy to the Communist Party\u2019s scrap heap of discarded dogma. And without so much as an expression of regret or an admission that it had perhaps made a mistake, the party pivoted from punishing couples for having a second child to encouraging them to get on with reproducing. To that end, an official said at a recent news conference that 18 million women would be eligible for the free removal of IUDs in the next three years so they could bear a second child. \u201cOur country provides support in terms of law, finance and service systems to ensure citizens\u2019 access to the free removal of IUDs,\u201d said the official, Song Li of the National Health and Family Planning Commission\u2019s department of women and children. But the   reversal, the paternalistic attitude, the failure to accept any culpability  \u2014   for some, it was too much. Within hours of the news conference, the internet was fuming with indignation. The mass implantation of IUDs amounted to \u201cinvoluntary, forced acts of mutilation,\u201d Han Haoyue, a popular columnist, wrote in a post shared nearly 3, 000 times on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. \u201cAnd now, to say they are offering free removal as a service to these tens of millions of women  \u2014   repeatedly broadcasting this on state television as a kind of state benefit  \u2014   they have no shame, second to none. \u201d Over the years, many Chinese women have come to hate the IUD, which is inserted into the uterus to block fertilization. In the novel \u201cFrog,\u201d by Mo Yan, the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, the main character imposes a reign of terror involving the compulsory implantation of IUDs and tries to catch women who surreptitiously remove them. In mainland China, being fitted with an IUD is called \u201cshang huan,\u201d a phrase that literally means \u201cinstalling a loop,\u201d referring to the   stainless steel ring that was the state\u2019s preferred device for more than a decade despite higher rates of complications. The rings were replaced in the   by safer and more effective IUDs. According to gynecologists in China, IUDs used for Chinese women were meant to be left indefinitely, with surgery necessary to take them out. Dr. Gloria Korta, a gynecologist at Winchester Physician Associates in Massachusetts, who toured Chinese hospitals as part of a cultural exchange in 2001, said that while there was a risk of infection from having an IUD implanted for many years, it was small. Perhaps because of the problems associated with the early model, there remains widespread concern in China about the IUD\u2019s impact on women\u2019s health. In 2012, the online portal Tencent published a lengthy report arguing that many Chinese women had \u201cexperienced serious damage to their mental and physical health\u201d from the IUD campaign because of \u201crough surgeries and poor hygiene conditions. \u201d Ai Xiaoming, 63, a prominent documentary filmmaker, said many women, herself included, had never been advised of potential complications and the need for regular checkups after getting an IUD. She had to have a hysterectomy when surgery to remove her IUD was botched. \u201cIn the eyes of the government, women are labor units,\u201d Ms. Ai said. \u201cWhen the country needs you to give birth, you have to do so. And when they don\u2019t need you to give birth, you don\u2019t. \u201d Even before the end of the   policy, the government allowed some women to remove their IUDs if they complained of medical complications. Others, including Ms. Zhang\u2019s mother, did it without permission, paying sympathetic doctors to remove them. But Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies the   policy, said the government appeared to be preparing to remove IUDs on a larger scale. \u201cThey were anticipating the numbers, how many operations need to be done, as if this is another government program,\u201d he said. The government\u2019s eagerness appears to be driven in part by growing concern over the economic impact of the nation\u2019s plummeting birthrate, now one of the lowest in the world. According to 2015 data, Chinese women had 1. 05 children on average, well below the population replacement rate of more than 2. 1. With fewer young people to support larger numbers of retirees in China, scholars have warned of a looming demographic crisis. But many couples are not interested in having a second child, some because of the potential costs, others because of their age. Cao Cuihua, 35, a restaurant owner in the central province of Anhui and the mother of a    boy, said she did not plan to remove her IUD because she and her husband could not afford more children. \u201cI did think about having a second child, but my economic circumstances don\u2019t allow it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis national policy to have two children has come a bit too late. \u201d Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of   who studies China\u2019s demographics, said half of all Chinese women eligible to have a second child were 40 or older. \u201cMost people have already lost the ability to give birth,\u201d Dr. Yi said by email. \u201cThe willingness to have children is already very low, so the Chinese government\u2019s offer of free surgeries will be of no avail. It will have little effect on the birthrate. \u201d Mao Qun\u2019an, a spokesman for China\u2019s family planning commission, defended the offer to remove IUDs and said the government would also cover the costs of surgery to reverse tubal ligations and vasectomies. (Such procedures are more complicated, and critics say most Chinese hospitals are not equipped for them.) Dr. Dalice Marriott, a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital, said a woman who had an IUD for a long time ran the risk of \u201chaving it embedded in the uterine wall. \u201d \u201cThat makes it much more difficult to remove,\u201d Dr. Marriott said, adding that the surgery could result in bleeding, infection and injury to the uterus. Asked about the public outcry over the government\u2019s offer to remove IUDs, Mr. Mao replied, \u201cWe did not deliberately emphasize that it\u2019s a government benefit. \u201d Li Yinhe, a prominent Chinese scholar of sex and the family, defended the government\u2019s approach, arguing that population control measures were \u201cnot targeted against women\u2019s rights. \u201d \u201cIf the state doesn\u2019t engage in this, then it\u2019s not only a disadvantage for men, it also hurts the interests of women,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen giving up their reproductive rights is a sacrifice that is made for the whole Chinese society. \u201d But many women want the government to acknowledge that its original policy was wrong. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done to women is inhumane,\u201d said Xu Dali, 35, a mother of two sons in Linyi. \u201cWhy did the government force every women then to have an IUD? At that time, why did it not consider the physical harm that has been inflicted on every woman?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563592.465879}
