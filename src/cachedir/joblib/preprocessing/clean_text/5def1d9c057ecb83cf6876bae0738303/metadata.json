Federal prosecutors also said that they would end an associated case against Mr. McDonnell\u2019s wife, Maureen. The decisions, made public in filings to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, effectively concluded a political, legal and filial drama that mesmerized and embarrassed Virginia, where the McDonnells were accused of a criminal bargain with a dietary supplements executive. \u201cAfter carefully considering the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision and the principles of federal prosecution, we have made the decision not to pursue the case further,\u201d the Justice Department said in a   statement after the filings were submitted. The terse end to the matter was, in some ways, expected after the Supreme Court ruled for Mr. McDonnell, a Republican, in June and narrowed the range of behavior that qualifies as public corruption. The court\u2019s ruling did not guarantee the close of Mr. McDonnell\u2019s legal problems  \u2014   until Thursday, it was unclear whether prosecutors would seek to retry him under the tapered standard  \u2014   but it was a reassuring one for him and his supporters. \u201cWe have said from the very first day that Bob McDonnell is an innocent man,\u201d his lawyers, Henry W. Asbill and Noel J. Francisco, said in a statement. \u201cAfter a long ordeal traversing the entire legal system, that truth has finally prevailed. We are thrilled Governor McDonnell can finally move on from the nightmare of the last three years and begin rebuilding his life. \u201d The lawyers added that they believed the Justice Department had \u201cbrought this case in good faith based on its view of the law as it existed at the time. \u201d Ms. McDonnell\u2019s lawyer, William A. Burck, issued a similar statement: \u201cWe thank the Department of Justice for the care with which they reviewed the case. We are thrilled and thankful that Maureen can now move on with her life. \u201d The McDonnells were charged in 2014, soon after Mr. McDonnell left office, in an indictment that presaged a sensational trial in Richmond, the Virginia capital. During the   trial, prosecutors depicted the former first couple as materialistic to the point of corruption because they accepted luxury gifts and   loans from Jonnie R. Williams Sr. who sought the governor\u2019s help in advancing his business interests. The benefits and gifts, including a Rolex, designer clothes and financial aid for a daughter\u2019s wedding, were worth more than $175, 000. Although the gifts were allowed under Virginia law, prosecutors successfully argued to a jury that the McDonnells, whose legal fates were often seen as intertwined, had violated federal anticorruption statutes. A judge later sentenced Mr. McDonnell to two years in prison, and Ms. McDonnell to a little more  than a year. Corruption experts were divided Thursday about whether the Justice Department\u2019s decisions reflected a new approach to corruption cases in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous decision. \u201cThe Department of Justice views this decision as having a material effect on the way they\u2019ve been prosecuting quid pro quo cases in the past,\u201d said Anthony M. Capozzolo, a former federal prosecutor, who interpreted the McDonnells\u2019 decisions as \u201ca sign that they\u2019re going to handle these cases differently. \u201d Still, others noted the extent to which prosecutorial decisions hinge on the facts and circumstances of specific cases. \u201cWhen a new legal standard is articulated by the Supreme Court and there\u2019s a need to potentially retry the case, prosecutors make a very particularized assessment as to whether, No. 1, they can still convince a jury of the individual\u2019s guilt under the new standard, and, two, whether it\u2019s in the interests of justice,\u201d said Arlo   a former chief of the public corruption unit in the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. Mr. McDonnell\u2019s lawyers did not say in Thursday\u2019s statement whether the former governor might try to resuscitate a political career that had spawned speculation about a presidential bid. But an August poll commissioned by The Washington Post suggested that Mr. McDonnell would face a daunting political landscape in the commonwealth, with some   of respondents saying that he should not seek office again.'"}, "time": 1742564602.526603}
