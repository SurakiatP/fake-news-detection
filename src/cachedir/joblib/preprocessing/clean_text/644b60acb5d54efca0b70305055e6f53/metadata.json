Trump was 100% true, yet Hillary Clinton still wound up being the greater evil? What then America? \\nIf the American people are to purchase a product, then do they not have a right to know just how much lesser this \u201cevil\u201d actually weighs versus the name brand? \\nLike those seasonal Cadbury Cream Eggs that old familiar product has returned to the shelves: lesser evil, with more fat and toxins this year than ever. This repackaged, re-branded item is what many Americans claim to want every four years, the only thing they ever want or care about politically, and they attack those who refuse to purchase it. It\u2019s rather like a Black Friday zombie frenzy descending on Walmart, but we are told by TV that this is \u201cdemocracy.\u201d It\u2019s not. It\u2019s oligarchy with bread and circuses. \\nThe so-called \u201clesser evil\u201d political philosophy is the only political philosophy these people seem to comprehend, but the core of the concept is overlooked. Their candidate of choice will admittedly commit evil acts. Do they not want to know what this alleged lesser evil entails? \\nSeems like self-deception is intrinsic to supporting this little house of cards. Perhaps if the phrase was amended to \u201cevil but possibly lesser,\u201d which is in fact more accurate, the public would spend a few seconds thinking about it when these Novembers inevitably roll around. \\nIs a nuclear holocaust \u201cevil?\u201d I suppose that\u2019s the crux of the debate we face today. One of those big two evil candidates has repeatedly, and irrationally, tried to provoke hostilities against nuclear-armed Russia, as part of some unstated agenda: the real agenda that has been torching the Middle East for decades. Wars of western conquest, which turned millions into hamburger, didn\u2019t just happen by themselves. Certain interests wanted to dismantle the oil-rich nations that considered themselves independent of Washington and the EU. The chaos of failed states was preferred to organized regimes that could form an independent bloc or fight back in any way.\\nAccording to Hillary R. Clinton, we should all be frothing at the Russians, and at Vladimir Putin for some set of vague claims without the substance that evidence would provide. Hillary and the Democratic National Committee were caught bloody-handed stealing the 2016 Democratic Party primary election from Bernie Sanders. Fraud. The only response she has mustered is the single word \u201cPutin.\u201d Yeah, sure: Putin did it. Repeated so often the word has lost all meaning here in the states, but abroad these quite undiplomatic slights do not pass unnoticed. \\nT he Russians unveiled their next generation ICBM , \u201cSatan 2,\u201d capable of wiping out the central east coast of America, or all of France, or the UK, or most of California. You get the idea, but does Hillary Clinton ? \\nShe insists on a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d in Syria, which the Russian military has already imposed against the invading US coalition , the one which has been arming and funding multiple armies of mass-murdering terrorists! \\nClinton privately told Goldman Sachs : \u201c They\u2019re getting more sophisticated thanks to Russian imports. To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we\u2019re not putting our pilots at risk you\u2019re going to kill a lot of Syrians\u2026 So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians.\u201d \\nIn the name of protecting civilians HRC wants to kill a lot of civilians and attack Russian-supplied air defense systems, and Russian military personnel of course. The fraud that Hillary Clinton and the interests she represents care in any way about dead Syrian civilians is laughable on its face. US foreign policy has never, ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete, absolute historical ignorance. But then again we\u2019re talking about the American public. \\nHow \u201cEvil\u201d is Hillary Clinton already? A merican corporate media refuses to call US war crimes war crimes. One can be impeached for a blowjob, but not for killing Nazi-level numbers of foreigners. There is no death count too high for the US Congress not to condone, if not to encourage. US foreign policy has never, ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete, absolute historical ignorance. But then again we\u2019re talking about the American public. \\nHillary Rodham Clinton has already played an instrumental role in the mass murders of approximately two million people, give or take. The Third Reich didn\u2019t bother with accurate tallies of its victims either. This figure shocks self-styled \u201cliberal\u201d Americans so thoroughly that they simply refuse to believe it. \\nClinton, as Senator, not only voted for an illegal war on Iraq (command responsibility), but she told \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d lies , selling the fraud to Democrats (lying to Congress). Estimates of Iraqi casualties range from half a million to a million and a half. The carnage continues to this day, and Crimes Against the Peace attribute responsibility for all the evil that results from initiating a war of aggression . This is codified in the UN Charter, and that makes Hillary Clinton also an international war criminal, just like Bush, just like Cheney. The hypocrisy of those who condemned Bush and yet joyfully cast a vote for HRC is staggering (yet commonplace). \\nThat was only one war. As Secretary of State Clinton took on even more responsibility for international crimes, notably the assault on Libya , another war of aggression. \\nAs the Russians noted , there was never any permission to bomb ground targets and help Al Qaeda linked rebels take over the country. \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing a large number of violations of the resolutions of the UN Security Council. Over the last few days, there have been reports of the NATO air force bombing civilian targets, including hospitals\u2026 This is an unacceptable situation; the United Nations Security Council did not authorize any such thing. Attempts to justify what\u2019s happening by claiming that the coalition does not go beyond the mandate are insufficient.\u201d \\n-Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u2026 \\n\u201cRegime change\u201d is a war crime , not an item on a menu for neocons to simply order up. Between 10 and 30,000 Libyans were massacred in the NATO-assisted destruction of Libya. Hillary Clinton displayed a gloating psychosis at the climax of the bloodletting. \\nOnto Syria, with a current corpse count of 470,000. What was Hillary Clinton\u2019s role? Seymour Hersh\u2019s reporting contrasts against the endless lies of politicians: \\n\u201c A highly classified annex to the report, not made public, described a secret agreement reached in early 2012 between the Obama and Erdogan administrations. It pertained to the rat line. By the terms of the agreement, funding came from Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the CIA, with the support of MI6, was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi\u2019s arsenals into Syria\u2026 The annex didn\u2019t tell the whole story of what happened in Benghazi\u2026 \u2018The consulate\u2019s only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms,\u2019 the former intelligence official, who has read the annex, said. \u2018It had no real political role.\u2019\u201d \\nHillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was deeply involved in this covert \u201cregime change\u201d plot, and the sequential wars resulting from it. To this day she insists on continuing the plot to overthrow Bashar Al Assad, the elected President of Syria. \\nDuring her husband\u2019s administration another half-million Iraqi children were killed as a result of US imposed sanctions on medicine and water filtration components. That UN death toll figure was deemed \u201cworth it\u201d by Madeleine Allbright in one of the most shocking news clips of the modern age. This unindicted yet confessed mass murderer campaigns openly for Hillary Clinton . \\nThere are other flash points where Hillary Clinton had a role, Haiti and Honduras for example. Scandals and atrocities have been reported, but this does not faze her supporters, nor most Americans who care nothing about the illegitimate actions of the US empire abroad. \\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s a pig, and the free world must play pretend that Hillary R. Clinton is not a proven and dangerous war criminal. Hollywood leads the charge and attacks dissenters. \\nHow deluded is America this year and how evil? \\nJill Stein of the Green Party is the peace candidate.'"}, "time": 1742562337.872769}
