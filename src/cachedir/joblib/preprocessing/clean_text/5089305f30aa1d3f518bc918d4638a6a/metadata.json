We had just gotten out of church, and I was with my family and some friends on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. We were going to lunch, trying to see if there was room in the Korean restaurant down the street. You were in a rush. It was raining. Our stroller and a gaggle of Asians were in your way. But I was, honestly, stunned when you yelled at us from down the block, \u201cGo back to China!\u201d I hesitated for a second and then sprinted to confront you. That must have startled you. You pulled out your iPhone in front of the Equinox and threatened to call the cops. It was comical, in retrospect. You might have been charged instead, especially after I walked away and you screamed, \u201cGo back to your fucking country. \u201d \u201cI was born in this country!\u201d I yelled back. It felt silly. But how else to prove I belonged? This was not my first encounter, of course, with racist insults. Ask any   and they\u2019ll readily summon memories of schoolyard taunts, or disturbing encounters on the street or at the grocery store. When I posted on Twitter about what happened, an avalanche of people replied back to me with their own experiences. But for some reason  \u2014   and, yes, it probably has to do with the political climate right now  \u2014   this time felt different. Walking home later, a pang of sadness welled up inside me. You had on a nice rain coat. Your iPhone was a 6 Plus. You could have been a fellow parent in one of my daughters\u2019 schools. You seemed, well, normal. But you had these feelings in you, and, the reality is, so do a lot of people in this country right now. Maybe you don\u2019t know this, but the insults you hurled at my family get to the heart of the   experience. It\u2019s this persistent sense of otherness that a lot of us struggle with every day. That no matter what we do, how successful we are, what friends we make, we don\u2019t belong. We\u2019re foreign. We\u2019re not American. It\u2019s one of the reasons that Fox News segment the other day on Chinatown by Jesse Watters, with the karate and nunchucks and broken English, generated so much outrage. My parents fled mainland China for Taiwan ahead of the Communist takeover. They came to the United States for graduate school. They raised two children, both of whom went to Harvard. I work at The New York Times. Model minority, indeed. Yet somehow I still often feel like an outsider. And I wonder if that feeling will ever go away. Perhaps, more important, I wonder whether my two daughters who were with me today will always feel that way too. Yes, the outpouring of support online was gratifying. But, afterward, my    who witnessed the whole thing, kept asking my wife, \u201cWhy did she say, \u2018Go back to China?\u2019 We\u2019re not from China. \u201d No, we\u2019re not, my wife said, and she tried to explain why you might have said that and why people shouldn\u2019t judge others. We\u2019re from America, she told my daughter. But sometimes people don\u2019t understand that. I hope you do now. Sincerely, Michael Luo'"}, "time": 1742564267.3460872}
