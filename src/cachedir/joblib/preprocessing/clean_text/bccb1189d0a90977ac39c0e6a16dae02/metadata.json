This small section of the DOJ handles litigation that arises when the federal government uses its \u201ceminent domain\u201d power to seize land for public projects.  The new money and staff is be devoted to the southern border, where according to an overview released by the Department, just two LAS attorneys are currently working with a budget of only $329, 000. The proposal represents a   increase in attorneys and a   increase in funding for LAS assistance with construction along the border. No \u201cwall\u201d is mentioned in the budget proposal, and DOJ officials were reluctant to confirm that the massive scaling up at LAS was specifically linked to the wall. \u201cWe do not have border wall money in the Department of Justice budget,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus, head of DOJ\u2019s Justice Management Division, assured reporters at a press conference announcing the proposal. Wall construction and the decision to purchase of the land necessary for it is not typically seen as a part of the DOJ\u2019s mission. Tuesday\u2019s budget proposals for border security and the Department of Homeland Security do, in fact, ask Congress for billions of dollars in funding increases. Up to $1. 6 billion is claimed to be devoted to \u201ca physical wall\u201d along the southern border. A Department of Justice press official confirmed that decisions as to which land to acquire for border security purposes would most likely be made at DHS. Defense of federal land acquisition, on the other hand, is squarely the Department of Justice\u2019s responsibility. The LAS handles the wide variety of lawsuits and legal complications that can arise when the government purchases and condemns land for any major federal project. By all estimations, any border wall would have significant land use implications. Asked by Breitbart News if there was any specific issue compelling the department to request the addition of ten new LAS lawyers on the southern border, Assistant Attorney General Lofthus said that there was not, and made clear it was a precautionary measure based on the possibility of any number of challenges  \u2014   eminent domain, environmental, etc.  \u2014   that could have been made to the administration\u2019s efforts on border security. Other   immigration enforcement requests for DOJ included $75 million to fund the 75 new immigration judges and their nearly 400 staff attorneys and support staff previously announced to deal with the massive backlog of pending removal cases. This will represent a nearly 25% increasing in federal immigration judges at the Executive Office for Immigration Review. The first of this new wave of immigration judges was sworn in earlier this month. For the nation\u2019s criminal courts, the DOJ is asking for $7. 2 to deploy 70 new assistant United States attorneys to handle exclusively immigration cases. New guidelines issued by Attorney General Jeff Sessions mandate far lower thresholds for referral for felony prosecution for illegal   and harboring of illegal aliens than under previous administrations. Along with the rest of the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal, it now lies in the hands of Congress to approve the Department of Justice\u2019s requests for immigration enforcement. The current continuing funding resolution expires in September.'"}, "time": 1742562368.8775816}
