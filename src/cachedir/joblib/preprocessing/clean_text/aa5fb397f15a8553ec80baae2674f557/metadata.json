We\u2019re talking about somebody who is so emasculated by Vladimir Putin  \u2026    that he has to come back and pick on vulnerable kids. \u201d  Petkanas said, \u201cThis is guidance that was provided to schools that schools wanted and asked for, and it is very  \u2014   it\u2019s for a very specific reason, they wanted to create a safe environment for all the kids in their school, and they wanted to avoid Title IX lawsuits. I mean, that\u2019s what\u2019s so   about what the Trump administration did today. He took away practical guidance to school administrators and principals, who were looking to create this safe environment, and were looking to not get sued for Title IX violations. \u201d He added, \u201cDonald Trump is not only a monster, but he\u2019s a coward. We\u2019re talking about somebody who is so emasculated by Vladimir Putin, that he has to come back  \u2014   no no  \u2014   that he has to come back and pick on vulnerable kids. \u201d The discussion then turned to the issue of transgenderism writ large. Petkanas stated that \u201cOne\u2019s gender identity is enough to show what gender they are. \u201d Petkanas was asked what would prevent host Tucker Carlson from playing on a women\u2019s sports team, serving a prison sentence in a women\u2019s prison. He responded that there aren\u2019t any examples of anyone doing this. After Petkanas said later in the interview that \u201cYour gender identity determines your gender, period. \u201d Carlson asked if this would mean he could go to a women\u2019s college or qualify for an SBA loan for   small businesses if he identified as a woman. Petkanas answered in the affirmative, and   that gender identity determines gender. When asked if you could identify as another race, Petkanas answered that you can\u2019t, and dismissed this as a \u201csilly\u201d hypothetical.
