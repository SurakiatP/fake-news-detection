National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice said the rule prohibits organizations that contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the administration of aid. \\n\u201cThe United States also needs to do more to institutionalize efforts to promote LGBT rights,\u201d Ms. Rice said in a speech at American University last week on the state of gay rights around the world. \\n\u201cAs part of that commitment, I\u2019m pleased to note that just yesterday a new rule went into effect that explicitly prohibits discrimination by USAID contractors. This rule means that any organization that contracts with USAID must ensure that all people can benefit from its federally funded programs, regardless of race, religion, disability \u2014 or sexual orientation and gender identity,\u201d she said. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major step toward ensuring that American assistance is provided in a fair and equitable manner,\u201d she said. \\nRoger Severino, director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, said the rule will create more problems than it solves. U.S. groups advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights lauded the move which affects more than $20 billion in aid programs in over 100 countries. In 2014 The United States cut aid to Uganda in response to a Ugandan law that imposed harsh penalties on homosexuality.'"}, "time": 1742564139.175416}
