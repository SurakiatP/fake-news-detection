Joseph Dunford, speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: a no-fly zone in Syria \\x93 would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia. \"\\nNo-fly zone would \\x91require war with #Syria and #Russia \\x92 \\x96 top US general https://t.co/veSy8uETak pic.twitter.com/zXyCmWjdXj\\n\\x97 RT America (@RT_America) September 22, 2016 Predictably, the Clinton (cash) machine has been relentless promoting Hillary\\x92s no-fly zone. Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war.\\nPass the missile launchers, please Trump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted \\x96 as she already was in the past \\x96 when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler.\\nI have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon \\x96 reflecting Dunford\\x92s comments - knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens \\x93 consequences .\\x94\\nThe Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two \\x93existential threats\\x94 to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear \\x93first-strike\\x94 \\x96 which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.\\nThe relentless hysteria now crystallized as Cold War 2.0 has led scores of analysts to game the actual \\x96 terrifying - possibility of a US-Russia hot war. As much as the Cold War MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine may now lie in the dust \\x96 exactly because Washington refuses to back down from \\x93first-strike\\x94 \\x96 only armchair Dr. Strangeloves get their kicks with the possibility of fighting a nuclear power. Dunford does not seem to be one of them.\\nWhat Hillary Clinton will certainly do is to double down on proxy wars, Vietnam/Afghanistan-style. So expect a President Clinton to authorize full weaponization of those Beltway-loved \\x93moderate\\x94 Al-Qaeda-in-Syria rebels with plenty of shoulder-held missile launchers. This could easily get out of control \\x96 with lethal, yet not nuclear, consequences.\\nThat\\x92s exactly the point made by Mikhail Rostovsky in Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets; if Hillary ratchets up tensions, \\x93 things could get out of hand .\\x94\\nAlso expect not so proxy ratcheting up of tension in the South China Sea; after all it was Hillary who claimed \\x91mothership\\x92 of the pivot to Asia; and it was Hillary who steered intra-South East Asian maritime disputes into the boiling cauldron of wider US-China competition.\\nAnd if that was not hard boiled enough, US frustration will be at an all-time high after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte\\x92s own pivot to China.\\nSay hello to my new Sarmat A case can be made that official Moscow is carefully getting ready to work with a Clinton \\x96 as in Obama III \\x96 presidency, with Hillary, a devil they know well when she was Secretary of State, to be dealt with as a pragmatist, unwilling and unable to plunge US-Russia relations into total incandescence.\\nA Clinton presidency for its part should know better than overestimate Russia\\x92s financial \\x93 weakness. \\x94\\nThe national debt of Russia is only 17.7 percent of GDP; for the US it is a whopping 104.17 percent of GDP, or $19.2 trillion. Russia in 2015 had a trade surplus of $150 billion, while the US had a trade deficit of $531.5 billion. The current account surplus of Russia was 5.1 percent of GDP, or 65.8 billion, while the US ran a current account deficit of 484.1 billion, or 2.7 percent of GDP.\\nBesides, Russia has all the natural resources it needs; unlike the US government, which believes it needs an empire of bases overseas and ten aircraft carrier task forces to secure the resources it lacks.\\nMoreover, as much as the Pentagon may continue to be infested by neocon cells, sound generals are also able to identify key Russian signals \\x96 such as the unveiling of the RS-28 Sarmat nuclear missile, which NATO calls Satan 2. The Sarmat delivers monster warheads of 40 megatons; boasts a top speed of seven kilometers per second; and is able to outfox any anti-missile shield system anywhere.\\nFirst images of new thermonuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile to replace \\'Satan\\' unveilled in Russia https://t.co/mmX2EHALQu\\n\\x97 RT (@RT_com) October 25, 2016\\nHot war? Hillary Clinton may have pulled a Julius Caesar over Gaddafi. But she\\x92s realist enough to not pull a (nuclear) Hitler over Moscow. Or is she?'"}, "time": 1742562284.9139974}
