[The piece, written by Shakeer Rahman and Robin Steinberg, slams New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for not going far enough when it comes to obstructing federal immigration officers from deporting illegal aliens:  The abruptness of the raids provoked criticism from local officials, including Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who vowed to stand with immigrant communities. But mass deportation under President Trump will also happen through a more routine policy that is in the mayor\u2019s control: endless, unnecessary arrests for   offenses, which end up feeding immigrants into the federal government\u2019s deportation machine. It\u2019s not enough for cities like New York to declare themselves \u201csanctuaries,\u201d which simply means that the local police won\u2019t detain noncitizens on the federal government\u2019s behalf. If cities really want to protect immigrants, they must also end the   style of policing that makes immigrants the victims of unnecessary arrests and disproportionate punishment. Many of these unnecessary arrests stem from the discredited idea that a draconian crackdown on the most minor offenses  \u2014   littering, selling loose cigarettes, biking on the sidewalk  \u2014   will prevent more serious crimes. This model of policing, known as broken windows or zero tolerance, helped to drive mass incarceration. Its next cost could be mass deportation. The   then decries the idea that illegal aliens can be deported for \u201cminor offenses like simple marijuana possession\u201d or any \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude,\u201d despite that policy seeming to have not changed at least over the last decade. ICE agents were also attacked in the   with Rahman and Steinberg writing, \u201cEven if cities stop sharing arrest information, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been known to send plainclothes agents to local courts, where they wait for immigrants to appear for misdemeanor charges. \u201d The   goes on to say that Trump\u2019s deportation effort of illegal immigrants, specifically those who have committed crimes, \u201ccan\u2019t happen without boots on the ground,\u201d though ICE has long used agents to investigate, arrest and deport criminals. \u201cUntil cities reject the failed thinking that led to mass incarceration, local police and prosecutors will be doing the legwork for mass deportation,\u201d the   concludes.
