The accusations against the employee, Waheed Al Bursh, came after Israel leveled charges Thursday against a Palestinian employee of World Vision in Gaza, saying he had funneled millions of dollars to Hamas. Mr. Bursh, an engineer with the United Nations Development Program since 2003, was detained on July 3 by Israel\u2019s internal security agency, the Shin Bet. Israeli news organizations reported that he had confessed to being instructed by Hamas officials to use his position to benefit the group. But Mr. Bursh\u2019s relatives in Gaza insisted he was not involved with Hamas. The United Nations agency, which is helping rebuild thousands of homes and other buildings destroyed by airstrikes in Israel\u2019s 2014   conflict with Gaza\u2019s militant groups, said in a statement that it was \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d about the allegations, had \u201czero tolerance for wrongdoing\u201d and would cooperate fully with the Israeli authorities. The statement said the agency was reviewing \u201cthe processes and circumstances surrounding the allegations,\u201d and noted that they appeared to involve only \u201cseven truckloads out of a total of nearly 26, 000\u201d bringing building materials into Gaza. But the indictment against Mr. Bursh  \u2014   on the heels of the World Vision case and the revelation on Monday that the aid group Save the Children was investigating whether one of its Palestinian workers had been recruited by Hamas  \u2014   raised broad questions about the vast network of humanitarian groups operating in Gaza. Emmanuel Nahshon, a spokesman for Israel\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the government was \u201casking for more vigilance\u201d from groups working in Gaza, where most of the population of 1. 8 million Palestinians relies on international organizations for food and other assistance. Already, World Vision has frozen its Gaza operations while investigations continue, and Germany and Australia have suspended their donations to the World Vision projects in the Palestinian territories. \u201cWorking in the Palestinian territories was hard before, and I can\u2019t imagine what it is going to be like now,\u201d said Ashley Jackson, a research associate with the Overseas Development Institute in London. Robert Piper, the United Nations\u2019 coordinator for humanitarian and development activities, issued a statement on Monday  \u2014   before the allegations against the agency engineer were made public  \u2014   calling any misuse of aid \u201ca profound betrayal. \u201d \u201cEveryone would pay a high price for such acts,\u201d Mr. Piper said. \u201cIf proven by a due legal process, these actions deserve unreserved condemnation Gaza\u2019s demoralized and vulnerable citizens deserve so much better. \u201d The indictment contends that Mr. Bursh transferred 300 tons of construction rubble to a port that he knew would be used at some point by the Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019s military wing. It says that he was contacted in April or May 2015 by Hosni Suleiman, an activist in the Qassam Brigades who was acting on behalf of a   Qassam member, Abu Anas  . It also accuses him of being in contact with two men referred to only by their last names, Rantissi and Radwan, two prominent   families in Gaza. The Shin Bet said in a statement that Mr. Bursh had also persuaded his managers to prioritize the rebuilding of homes in an area \u201cpopulated by Hamas members,\u201d and had notified Hamas activists when United Nations workers removing rubble uncovered openings of attack tunnels or entrances to   rooms so they could take control of the sites. An uncle of Mr. Bursh\u2019s denied the charges. He said the engineer, who is from Jabaliya, a crowded neighborhood north of Gaza City, was a quiet family man whose wife had given birth to their seventh child while he was in detention. \u201cIf Waheed came to me and said, \u2018I belong to a militant group,\u2019 I would respond to him and say, \u2018You are liar,\u2019 \u201d said the uncle, who would give only his nickname, Abu Abed. Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader in Gaza, said the group did \u201cnot rely on employees of international aid organizations for any needs of the resistance. \u201d He added that if the allegations are true, \u201cthen it is an individual act  \u2014   we are not responsible. \u201d But Naji Sharrab, a political science professor at Al Azhar University in Gaza, said the idea of Hamas\u2019s pressuring aid workers was not surprising because of its   on power in the territory. Hamas security forces can search or shut down offices, he noted, and can prevent people from entering or leaving Gaza. \u201cHamas has complete authority to interfere and control all the organizations working in Gaza,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562114.2580695}
