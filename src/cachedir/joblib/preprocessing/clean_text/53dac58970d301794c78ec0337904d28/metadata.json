The postelection atmosphere suggests this trend is not slowing down any time soon. The latest political fashion statement? The safety pin, an object that\u2019s been adopted in the past by   celebrities (remember Elizabeth Hurley\u2019s Versace dress?) and the punk movement. After the election of Donald J. Trump, fears are growing that segments of his base may physically or emotionally abuse minorities, immigrants, women and members of the L. G. B. T. community. As a show of support, groups of people across America are attaching safety pins to their lapels, shirts and dresses to signify that they are linked, willing to stand up for the vulnerable. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of showing people who get it that I will always be a resource and an ally to anyone and everyone who wants to reach out,\u201d said Kaye Kagaoan, 24, a graphic designer from the Philippines who lives in Brooklyn. \u201cWhen I saw it on Facebook, it was so simple. It resonated with me. \u201d On Friday, the actor Patrick Stewart posted a photo of himself to Twitter wearing a pin on his jacket, and the photographer Cass Bird shared an Instagram post about why she\u2019s wearing one that started with \u201cIf you wear a hijab, I\u2019ll sit with you on the train\u201d and ended with: \u201cIf you need me, I\u2019ll be with you. All I ask is that you be with me, too. \u201d Between the two statements, sentences began with \u201cIf you\u2019re a person of color   \u2026     \u201d and \u201cIf you\u2019re a refugee   \u2026     \u201d and offered various forms of support. The actress Jaime King posted the same words to her Instagram account. In wearing the safety pin, participants are taking a page from protesters of the Brexit referendum results. After British citizens voted to leave the European Union in June, the nation experienced a 57 percent rise in reported xenophobic incidents. An American woman living in Britain tweeted a suggestion that people wear safety pins to show support to those experiencing abuse. Two days later, #safetypin was trending on Twitter. The woman, who used a Twitter account, @cheeahs, that has been deleted, had been inspired by the #illridewithyou movement in Australia, in which people offered to take public transportation with Muslims fearing a backlash after a Muslim gunman held people hostage in a cafe in 2014. Those who\u2019ve donned the pin over the last week are quick to point out that their message isn\u2019t necessarily in opposition to the  . \u201cMore than anything, it\u2019s \u201d said Sabrina Krebs, 22, a Barnard student from Guatemala City. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s resistance towards Trump. It\u2019s a form of resistance to hate and to negativity. \u201d It is also, Ms. Krebs noted, a readily accessible item. \u201cEveryone has safety pins in their house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something everyone can join. \u201d (But in case someone wants a more haute kind of protest, fashion has already jumped on the movement, with Fashionista suggesting \u201c13 Safety Pin Brooches to Wear Now and for the Next Four Years,\u201d with items ranging from a   pin to one with crystal embellishments.) And it\u2019s easy to put on. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to wear a safety pin,\u201d said Robert Clarke, 52, a truck driver from Harrington Park, N. J. \u201cI have them on several jackets, so I don\u2019t have to think about it. \u201d Some Twitter users voiced criticisms of the   trend, calling it \u201cslacktivism,\u201d a word that blends \u201cslacker\u201d and \u201cactivism. \u201d They expressed concern that wearing something doesn\u2019t equate to action. Christopher Keelty, an author and nonprofit   denounced the safety pins as something white people are wearing to assuage their guilt. \u201cThey\u2019ll do little or nothing to reassure the marginalized populations they are allegedly there to reassure marginalized people know full well the long history of white people calling themselves allies while doing nothing to help, or even inflicting harm on,   Americans,\u201d he wrote. Wearers responded by acknowledging the critique. \u201cI recognize that wearing a #safetypin is not sufficient action and does not supplement provide active, constructive work,\u201d  @OliviaHungers wrote. \u201cDonate time. Donate money. Support people in your community with action. If you still wear the pin be sure to be ready to back it up. \u201d For his part, Mr. Clarke said that the pin isn\u2019t just a signal of allegiance to those he encounters, but a constant reminder to himself. \u201cA big part of wearing it is the mental preparation on my part,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I do see something, I\u2019ve thought it through, and I\u2019ll stand up and say something and not be a silent witness. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562219.7417314}
