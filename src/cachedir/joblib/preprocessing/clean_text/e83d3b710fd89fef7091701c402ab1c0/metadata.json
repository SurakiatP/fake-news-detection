Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets.\\n\u201cWhat we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,\u201d said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. \u201cYou\u2019re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.\\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fighting Syria any more, you\u2019re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,\u201d he said.\\nClinton\u2019s campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.\\n\u201cOnce again, he is parroting Putin\u2019s talking points and playing to Americans\u2019 fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,\u201d Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement.\\nTrump said Assad is much stronger now than he was three years ago and said getting Assad to leave power was less important than defeating Islamic State.\\n\u201cAssad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,\u201d he said.\\nA memo was leaked earlier this year showing Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department said on December 31, 2012 that overthrowing Syria was the \u201cbest way to help Israel.\u201d \\n\\nThe foreign policy goals in that State Department memo just so happen to align with the goals of this powerful Israeli think tank :\\n\\nSeeing as how the U.S. just last month conducted an airstrike on a group of Syrian fighters to help ISIS overrun one of their positions , it\u2019s not unreasonable to question what the hell is actually going on here.\\nUniting with Assad and Russia to destroy ISIS, as Trump has said he would do, is without a doubt the sane plan in Syria if one wants to pursue America\u2019s interests. Instead, Clinton and Obama are trying to both overthrow Assad by arming \u201cgood\u201d rebel groups and somehow also kill ISIS on the side \u2013 though it just so happens the weapons they\u2019re giving to the \u201cgood\u201d rebels keep falling into ISIS\u2019s hands.\\nThe result has been what we\u2019re seeing in Syria \u2013 an endless, drawn out war leading to untold human misery, suffering, death and the migrant crisis.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742563680.0576272}
