Despite the fact that blocs which opposed NATO no longer exist, it\u2019s impossible to change the alliance\u2019s \u201c aggressive nature \u201d due to its ideological and political bases. \\nEarlier on Monday, the Times published a report suggesting that \u201c hundreds of thousands of NATO troops will be put on a higher state of alert amid growing tensions with Russia .\u201d According to the British daily \u2013 which cites the alliance\u2019s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the UK\u2019s outgoing permanent representative to the bloc, Adam Thomson \u2013 NATO aims to largely speed up the time its troops can be deployed. \\nIt reportedly aims to have up to 300,000 military personnel from nations across the alliance at the ready, having shortened their response time to about two months, compared to the current 180 days. \\n\u201c We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War ,\u201d Stoltenberg told the Times . The bloc is looking into how more of its 3 million personnel \u201c can be ready on a shorter notice ,\u201d he added, saying that NATO defense ministers have already had discussions on the issue. \\nHaving accused Moscow of \u201c assertive \u201d behavior, the NATO chief said Russia had increased its defense spending and was \u201c developing new military capabilities .\u201d \\n\u201c In regard to its national security, Russia acts within its national borders, undoubtedly posing no threat to anyone ,\u201d Peskov said, commenting on Stoltenberg\u2019s statements. The way the military bloc has reacted \u201c once again shows the organization\u2019s aggressive nature ,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742562858.1779711}
