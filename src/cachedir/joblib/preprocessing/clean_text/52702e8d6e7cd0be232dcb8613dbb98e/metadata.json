Law defined by God is abhorrent to most of the same people. \\nThink about that and you\u2019ll quickly get clarity as to why we are where we are in America. \\nJust swap \u201claw\u201d for \u201cGod\u2019s law\u201d and the otherwise adored and championed concept as embraced and proclaimed throughout the land by gajillions of supposedly God-loving American people suddenly becomes something to fear, avoid, run away from, deny, ignore, work around and/or generally malign. \\nReplace \u201claw\u201d with \u201cGod\u2019s law\u201d and you will find most \u201cconservative Christian\u201d types in America flipping like a switch in conversations about how government and law ought to be approached here in *ahem* God\u2019s creation. \\nMuch like the concepts freedom, liberty, prosperity, success, and peace, the concept of law has been thoroughly separated from God in the minds of most politically active conservatives claiming the name of Christ in America. \\nIn short, it is self-described conservative Christians in America who have long modeled the open contempt for God\u2019s Law that has led us to where we are now. \\nTalk about the importance of generic law in America, and these people will cheer and champion your cause. \\nTalk about the importance of God\u2019s Law in America, and they\u2019ll more often than not rail against the notion and turn on your personally for even bringing the idea into focus. \\n\u201cWe the People\u201d are God in practice , after all. \\n\u201cWe the People\u201d are free to define our own approach to reality based on our (ever-shifting) standards as we see fit, at least as far as most politically active professing Christian conservatives in the land are concerned. \\nDon\u2019t believe me? \\nJust ask \u2019em what they think about \u201claw.\u201d \\nLet them go on as long as they like in response. Ask obvious follow-up questions honestly and encourage them to give detailed answers. \\nThen, after they\u2019ve made their view of law and its role in America plain, ask \u2019em the same question about God\u2019s Law and its binding authority over America and every other part of God\u2019s creation. \\nArticle reposted with permission from Fire Breathing Christian Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .
