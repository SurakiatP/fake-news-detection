LuPone, however wasn\u2019t the only nominee to take a swipe at the President. \u201cMaybe it would give him a little bit of a soul? It\u2019s hard not to feel things when you\u2019re watching our performance,\u201d Dene\u00e9 Benton, star of the Dave Malloy musical Natasha, Pierre  The Great Comet of 1812, told Variety. Fox\u2019s 24 Legacy star Corey Hawkins, who was nominated for Best Actor in a Play (but didn\u2019t win) for his role in Six Degrees of Separation, said President Trump should see the satirical parody of   New York liberals \u201cbecause it\u2019s about connection. It\u2019s about reaching out, and it\u2019s about seeing each other for who we are, and it\u2019s about honesty, and it\u2019s about love. I think our country could stand to use a lot of that right now. \u201d Sunday night\u2019s Tony Awards was hosted by actor Kevin Spacey. The House of Cards star cracked several jokes aimed at Bill and Hillary Clinton during the show.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742563152.2065034}
