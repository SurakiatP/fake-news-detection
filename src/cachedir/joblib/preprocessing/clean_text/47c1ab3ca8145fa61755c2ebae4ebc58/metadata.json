The hairdo paid homage to the one Jane Fonda made supercool as the Times Square hooker Bree Daniels in the 1971 movie \u201cKlute. \u201d Alexander McQueen also cited Ms. Fonda as a motivating force of \u201cDeliverance,\u201d his spring 2004 collection, which has gone down in fashion history for its dance presentation inspired by Ms. Fonda\u2019s performance in the 1969 drama \u201cThey Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?\u201d In her late \u201960s heyday, Ms. Fonda played her fair share of     roles. Off screen, she was the ultrachic Paris wife of the director Roger Vadim, and was a   fixture at shows staged by his friends Coco Chanel, Hubert de Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent. Recently, speaking by phone from a film location in Colorado, Ms. Fonda, 78, firmly denied her style pedigree. \u201cI am not a fashionista,\u201d she said. Ms. Fonda\u2019s political activism often overshadowed her status as a sartorial influencer. Highlighting it, however, is her collection of couture, Italian    and lavish screen costumes that will be auctioned on Friday at Julien\u2019s Auctions in Los Angeles. About five of the items are  . But when asked if she had considered donating an Atelier Versace gown, a Valentino something, even her stripy workout leotard to, perhaps, the Met Costume Institute, she offered an unyielding \u201cNo. \u201d Ms. Fonda is auctioning her possessions (698 items in all, mostly clothing) in a housecleaning exercise. \u201cI had to do jobs to pay for my storage,\u201d she said of the units she had maintained since her 2001 divorce from the media mogul Ted Turner. \u201cBecause Ted did not like to carry a lot of luggage on his jet  \u2014   it was too burdensome  \u2014   I would have to buy things in bulk\u201d for their travels to his many properties. Parting with mementos was tough yet ultimately worthwhile. \u201cLighter,\u201d she said of her sense of relief on clearing the space. Here, Ms. Fonda tells the stories behind some pieces going under the gavel. Ms. Fonda wore the Yves Saint Laurent pantsuit below when she claimed the Oscar as best actress in 1972. The somber black ensemble, with its sharp   jacket, reflected the Communist sympathies she had developed before buying the suit in 1968. Ms. Fonda had just given birth to her daughter Vanessa Vadim, and during her pregnancy said she had grown horrified watching French television broadcasts of the attacks on North Vietnam. By the time of the Oscars Ms. Fonda was divorcing Mr. Vadim, and though she had hung on to her haute couture, she had exchanged her New Wave lifestyle for a     antiwar lecture tour across the United States. The Hollywood establishment feared she would use the Oscars as another stop on it. \u201cI wanted to make a speech about Vietnam,\u201d Ms. Fonda admitted of the ceremony. Instead, she listened to her father, Henry Fonda, who advised her to refrain from politicking at the podium. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018Just say: \u2018There is a lot to be said. But tonight is not the time.\u2019 So I did. And I wore something that made a statement. It was not a time for showy dresses. It was a time for seriousness. \u201d Before Yeezy, there was Fonda. Ms. Fonda introduced her own line of luxe exercise apparel in 1984, after her workout book and its video adaptation, both fronted by an image of her in this black and red leotard, had dominated   lists for years. Though films like \u201cFlashdance\u201d and \u201cPerfect\u201d made aerobics gear au courant, Ms. Fonda\u2019s namesake aerobics label proved too   and quickly folded. The 40 pieces from Atelier Versace that Ms. Fonda is auctioning are the standouts of the sale. The garments run the gamut from her flamboyant Oscar gowns to embellished couture that Lesage, the venerable Paris embroidery house, produced by channeling Gianni Versace\u2019s inimitable   take on Picasso\u2019s Rose Period and Robert Delaunay\u2019s abstract paintings. Many of the pieces were selected for Ms. Fonda by Mr. Versace after they met in 1989. In the midst of divorcing her second husband, Tom Hayden, at the time, she had controversially acquired breast implants and was dating a    Italian soccer goalkeeper, Lorenzo Caccialanza. \u201cI was in Italy with him, and I met Gianni then,\u201d Ms. Fonda recalled. \u201cGianni kind of took me under his wing. And whenever I would do a red carpet, he would supply my clothes. He gave me dresses, belts, gloves and shoes. He was very generous. \u201d Ms. Fonda sees no conflict between her political stances and her flaunting of Versace, a label that was often criticized for dressing supermodels in bondage numbers. \u201cI used to think, \u2018I have to be very serious,\u2019\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut being a feminist is not about the antithesis of being sexy or looking good. \u201d As the daughter of a Golden Era Hollywood actor, Ms. Fonda likely noticed as his contemporaries, like Lauren Bacall and Audrey Hepburn, often walked off film sets with their wardrobes. The garments were made by skilled costume designers whose work was often on par with couturiers. Ms. Fonda continued the practice, and three dresses by the   costume designer Ann Roth, which she wore in the 1981 film \u201cRollover,\u201d are up for grabs. \u201cRollover,\u201d a financial thriller, predated \u201cWall Street\u201d and \u201cThe Big Short. \u201d But it flopped. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get the script right,\u201d Ms. Fonda said. Although her life eventually reflected the part she had played  \u2014   a film star who \u201cgave it all up\u201d to become the wife of an industrialist  \u2014   she made good use of her glam wardrobe. A decade after making the movie, Ms. Fonda quit acting and donned the   lace \u201cRollover\u201d gown to marry Mr. Turner. A sumptuous sequined velvet gown from the film went to the White House when Ms. Fonda accompanied him to a 1994 dinner for the Emperor and Empress of Japan. \u201cI am very much in favor of wearing things more than once,\u201d Ms. Fonda said. Two months went into the making of this Schiaparelli couture gown, which Ms. Fonda wore at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival premiere of \u201cYouth. \u201d Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s drama, in which Ms. Fonda portrayed an aging starlet, was competing for the Palme d\u2019Or prize. \u201cJane was very proud of the movie, and she wanted to make a special moment of the premiere,\u201d said a Schiaparelli spokeswoman who worked on the dress with Ms. Fonda and her stylist, Tanya Gill. So in a departure from the   Versace dresses Ms. Fonda has made her signature at Cannes, working the red carpet as a L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris spokeswoman (the cosmetics company sponsors the festival) she opted for a regal full skirt and   gown, which was adapted from a 1952 Elsa Schiaparelli design. \u201cIt was a lot of fun to wear,\u201d Ms. Fonda said. \u201cIt felt really good. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562606.9299784}
