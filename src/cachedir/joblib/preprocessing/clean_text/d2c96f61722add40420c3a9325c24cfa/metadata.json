Trump was unlikely to reverse the warming of ties with Cuba, he would almost certainly   trade deals in Latin America. \u201cThere are going to be tensions that arise, probably around trade more than anything,\u201d Mr. Obama told an audience of students and young leaders from Latin America. \u201cBecause the   campaigned on looking at every trade policy and potentially reversing those policies. \u201d Even on trade, though, Mr. Trump will have a tough time making drastic changes to United States policy, Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut once they look at how it\u2019s working, I think they\u2019ll actually determine that it\u2019s working for both the United States and our partners,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe friendships we\u2019ve established with countries like Peru, the reopening of diplomatic relations with Cuba, investments we\u2019re making in trade, environmental policies and so forth  \u2014   all those things I expect to continue,\u201d he added. Mr. Trump has offered contradictory views on Cuban relations. Early in his campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to support restoring ties, but he said more recently in Miami that Mr. Obama should have gotten a better deal. Mr. Obama was speaking to aspiring entrepreneurs and civil society leaders about how to improve their lives and countries  \u2014   one of his preferred activities  \u2014   during the last stop of his final overseas trip as president. He began his trip on Tuesday in Greece, went to Germany on Wednesday and flew to Peru on Friday to attend the   Economic Cooperation summit meeting. Along the way, he has tried, with limited success, to reassure audiences that Mr. Trump will not discard the agreements and priorities that Mr. Obama has devoted much of his presidency to advancing. His toughest task was here at a summit meeting of an organization that helped birth the   Partnership trade agreement, an accord that is almost certainly dead as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. Also, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature campaign strategies was to demonize immigrants from Latin America, and he referred to those crossing the border from Mexico as rapists and criminals. Just about every question posed to Mr. Obama from the audience here had to do with the anxiety Mr. Trump has stirred in this part of the world. \u201cThe United States is such a big country that, after any election, people are uncertain,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI think it will be important for people around the world to not make immediate judgments. \u201d He also predicted that relations between Latin America and the United States would not change much. \u201cThe main message I want you to know is that you have a partner in me and you have a partner in the United States government,\u201d Mr. Obama said to applause. \u201cAnd we are going to work together. \u201d Part of the reason relations are unlikely to change dramatically, he said, is that the United States\u2019 security depends on Latin American nations\u2019 faring well enough that their people decide to remain home instead of attempting the arduous journey to enter the United States illegally. \u201cThe best way for my daughters to be secure in America is to make sure that people in Guatemala or El Salvador are also feeling secure because, if they\u2019re not, that may spill over the borders to us,\u201d he said. While the illegal migration of Mexicans has largely halted in recent years, gang violence in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala has combined with economic desperation to drive migrants from those countries to seek safety in other countries, mainly the United States. Answering a question on Saturday from a Venezuelan audience member, Mr. Obama painted a dark portrait of the progress of freedom around the world, and said the wave of countries adopting democratic governance had reversed itself. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing some countries that are going backward rather than forwards in terms of freedom of press, freedom of the internet, in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society,\u201d he said. Venezuela\u2019s economy is nearing collapse as its government cracks down on opposition leaders in an increasingly desperate effort to cling to power. Mr. Obama also said a growing number of people were now arguing that democracy is incompatible with development. China\u2019s success over the past 30 years in creating a manufacturing colossus through its authoritarian measures has some leaders, particularly in Asia, insisting that too much democracy can be detrimental. But Mr. Obama said that, over the long term, countries that pursue democracy, transparency and accountability fare far better than those that do not. \u201cIn this time that we live in, development is based on knowledge and innovation and education and new thinking and sharing of ideas,\u201d Mr. Obama said. In authoritarian systems, economies respond poorly to change because their populations are not as   or as flexible, he said. \u201cYou can maintain order for a while with repressive nondemocratic governance, but it will rot from within,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cOver time, those governments fail and those economies fail. \u201d Mr. Obama told the crowd here to avoid fervent nationalism and identity politics, which he said could lead to conflicts. \u201cIf the most important thing about you is that you are an American,\u201d Mr. Obama began, drawing an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump, \u201cif that\u2019s the one thing that defines you, then you may end up being threatened by people from other places, when in fact you may have a lot in common and you may miss opportunities. \u201d Mr. Trump has defined his governing philosophy as \u201cAmerica First,\u201d and has already appointed avowed nationalists to top positions in his administration. Mr. Obama described himself as a proud American, but said the world was far too interconnected for leaders to be wholly focused on their own nations. \u201cIf there\u2019s pollution in China, then that affects you here in Peru,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563889.7047505}
