[Ravel, who has previously called for regulation of political websites such as The Drudge Report, stated that without regulation of the internet and digital platforms, the role of the FEC will essentially become obsolete as the FEC focuses mainly on TV and radio content.  \u201cWe know that there\u2019s a lot of campaigning that\u2019s moved to the internet, whether it\u2019s through fake news or just outright advertising and there is almost no regulation of this, very little. And so that the disclosure that we expect as to who is behind campaigns is not going to exist soon,\u201d said Ravel at the Berkeley law school. \u201cSome people are even predicting that by 2020 most of the advertising is going to move from television to the internet, and and I think this is a serious issue that requires a lot of discussion. \u201d Ravel claimed that the use of Facebook and other social media platforms by political campaigns is a problem. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of campaign consultants and they buy some groups in Holland or in Russia who figure out who the target audience might be and then they go through circuitous mechanisms to put ads or fake news or whatever it is on Facebook. \u201d \u201cFacebook doesn\u2019t have any real knowledge about who it is that\u2019s behind those ads, so I think this is a really serious issue that we need to address,\u201d claimed Ravel.
