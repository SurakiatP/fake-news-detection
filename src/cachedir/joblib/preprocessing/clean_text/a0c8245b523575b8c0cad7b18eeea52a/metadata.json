[Brat said the speaker is worried about the insurance companies, who backed the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, because the system they created cannot be sustained because of its perverse incentives, regulations, and costs.  In addition to the flaws in the Obamacare legislation and buildout, the congressman said it is foolish to attempt a political solution to an economic problem that forces you to accommodate the needs and values of 300 million Americans  \u2014   such as people in both California and Texas  \u2014   at the same time. The RyanCare bill is not connected to the promises President Donald Trump made on the campaign trail, said the former head of the economic department at   College. \u201cWe want Trump to be hugely successful, so we don\u2019t want to handle a bill that\u2019s going to fail in a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump ran on   and competition across state lines, getting the price down  \u2014   the price is going up by 20 percent and the bill we are getting ready to vote on, once again, goes back and does too much emphasis on the coverage aspect,\u201d he said. Focusing on coverage makes it impossible for the bill to ever work, he said. \u201cFive percent of the people with   conditions, et cetera  \u2014   very serious issues that every bill deals with  \u2014   but five percent of the folks will cost 50 percent of the entire health care market,\u201d he said. A   condition has nothing to do with insurance, because the person already had the problem, he said. \u201cThat is not an insurance problem. That is a health care problem, and we\u2019ve got to fix that. For the rest of the 300 million, we\u2019ve got to design an efficient system that follows   logic, where you get to go shop. \u201d Obamacare has many rules and restrictions governing how the insurance companies structure policies and run their own firms, he said. Lifting the regulatory burden on the insurance industry would free them to innovate, he said, \u201cIn the current bill, I\u2019ve asked leadership, budget committee experts: \u2018Can a young person go out and buy a health care insurance product of their choosing?\u2019 The answer is no,\u201d he said. The reason is that the regulations on the insurance companies require certain \u201cessential health care benefits,\u201d so that everyone in the country is forced to buy the same coverage, whether they need it or not,\u201d Brat said. In the RyanCare bill, the individual mandate was supposed to go away, but instead, it is reconfigured as a continuing care option tied to the   condition protections, he said. Under Ryancare someone can go without insurance for 10 years and then upon learning they have cancer, sign up for \u201cinsurance. \u201d Brat said the only penalty would be a 30 percent surcharge upon their premiums. \u201cIt is a perverse economic system. \u201d The congressman said nothing makes the politics of the RyanCare bill more plain than the fact that in 2015, Republicans in the House and Senate passed a   repeal of Obamacare  \u2014   when everyone knew it would be vetoed by President Barack Obama. Now with real bullets, Republicans are stepping away from repeal to put forward a RyanCare bill that preserves the structure and spirit of Obamacare. The speaker\u2019s bill is unlikely to pass the House, but even if it makes it to the Senate, it will not pass there, either, Brat said. Then, hopefully, the Republican leadership will work with Capitol Hill conservatives to craft a true repeal of Obamacare that synchs up with what Trump promised the American people, Bratt concluded.'"}, "time": 1742628292.588288}
