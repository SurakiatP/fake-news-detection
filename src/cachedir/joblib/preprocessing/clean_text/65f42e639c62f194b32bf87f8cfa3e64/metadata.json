Trump instead spent most of his time on live television Tuesday berating the journalists covering his presidential campaign in unusually vitriolic and personal terms. \u201cYou\u2019re a sleaze,\u201d he told a reporter for ABC. \u201cYou\u2019re a real beauty,\u201d he told a reporter for CNN, snidely denigrating the man\u2019s competence. For 40 minutes, Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, assailed those reporting on his candidacy with a level of venom rarely seen at all, let alone in public, from the   of a major political party. Then he warned that a Trump White House would feature more of the same. Historians reached back to the Nixon administration, with its   enemies list, for a fair comparison. Other scholars and political analysts suggested that Mr. Trump failed to appreciate the role journalists play in scrutinizing candidates as surrogates for the public, or drew connections to his denunciations of other adversaries and critics  \u2014   like a federal judge in a case where Mr. Trump is being sued, or the Republican governor of New Mexico, whom Mr. Trump denigrated while campaigning in her state last week. Mr. Trump\u2019s broadside was especially provocative given that concerns have been raised throughout the campaign about whether the news media collectively have failed to subject his candidacy to enough scrutiny and skepticism. The particular knot in which Mr. Trump entangled himself on Tuesday had come to light through simple  . In January, fuming at Fox News, he skipped the final Republican debate before the Iowa caucuses because that network was hosting it. He held his own competing event, a televised   that he said would benefit military veterans, and announced from the stage that he had raised more than $6 million, including $1 million he was donating himself. But the full amount did not materialize quickly, and The Washington Post reported a week ago that Mr. Trump had yet to make his own donation. In his news conference, Mr. Trump produced and read aloud a list of charitable groups and the exact amounts he said each had received, interrupting himself frequently to condemn individual journalists, the news media in general, or political reporters as an exceptionally odious class. \u201cUnbelievably dishonest,\u201d he called them. To show that he had finally made his own   donation, Mr. Trump produced a photocopy of a check. (His litany of recipients glossed over an admission that his January boast had indeed been an exaggeration: All told, he said, $5. 6 million has been provided to or earmarked for charities so far.) \u201cThe press should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Veterans are \u201ccalling me, and they are furious,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou make me look very bad. \u201d Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on the presidency and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump appeared to be making assumptions about journalism that were \u201cso faulty as to be bizarre. \u201d \u201cThe notion that the press would be writing stories praising him for keeping a promise he made in public to veterans, months after he made the promise, suggests he simply does not understand the function of the press,\u201d she said. And the president of the National Press Club, Thomas Burr, issued a blistering statement suggesting that Mr. Trump \u201cmisunderstands  \u2014   or, more likely, simply opposes  \u2014   the role a free press plays in a democratic society. \u201d \u201cAny American political candidate who attacks the press for doing its job is campaigning in the wrong country,\u201d Mr. Burr said. Mr. Trump has routinely treated journalists as foils, and those covering his campaign appearances as unwitting, unspeaking extras good for a joke or two. On Tuesday, however, reporters played a sharply different role, repeatedly pressing him for answers. Why had he waited so long to make his own donation? Several times, Mr. Trump said that it had taken time to scrutinize charities to make sure they were legitimate, though the recipient of his $1 million check was a group well known to him: Its vice chairman is the managing director of the Trump SoHo hotel, and the group gave Mr. Trump an award last year. Strangely, Mr. Trump also suggested that the delays somehow owed to a desire to keep a low profile. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the credit for it,\u201d he said, adding moments later, \u201cI\u2019m not looking for credit. \u201d Yet Mr. Trump had announced his   for veterans on national television in January and had trumpeted it several times since, a reporter countered. Wasn\u2019t that taking credit? \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mr. Trump replied tersely, quickly taking another question. In the past, Mr. Trump has used evasive maneuvers to sidestep difficult questions and made    statements that often went unchallenged at the time. But even after a query about the shooting of a gorilla at an Ohio zoo over the weekend, reporters brought Mr. Trump back to the matter at hand. If he had intended to deliver a cogent attack on his likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, or to promote his plans for how to improve veterans\u2019 assistance as president, his performance squashed it. The   group Correct the Record responded by saying the performance raised new questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament. \u201cUnder pressure for lying about his monetary support for our veterans, Trump threw a tantrum  \u2014   hurling insults at reporters instead of owning up to his broken promise to veterans,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cTrump\u2019s failure to face even the tiniest amount of media scrutiny about his supposed support for America\u2019s veterans exposes just how unqualified he is to be our country\u2019s commander in chief. \u201d But Mr. Trump, in the moment at least, seemed unconcerned. A reporter asked if Mr. Trump\u2019s demeanor was an indication of what White House news conferences would be like if he were elected. \u201cYes, it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to be like this. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563491.155671}
