But now the gummy bear has grown up. A number of supposedly \u201c  \u201d gummies for adults have been introduced in the vitamin and supplement market. Among the many choices: Vitafusion sells Power C Gummy Vitamins for Adults, which promise \u201cgreat tasting gummies with natural orange flavor. \u201d Caltrate Gummy Bites pack calcium and vitamin D in black cherry, orange or strawberry gummy candies. \u201cThey taste good  \u2014   like candy,\u201d said Susan Drexler, 53, a Manhattan real estate agent and gummy vitamin lover. \u201cI take them much more consistently. \u201d Ms. Drexler got into gummies through her    daughter, Alana. Ms. Drexler has a \u201cbear of a time swallowing large pills or capsules,\u201d she said. A few years ago, she tried some of her daughter\u2019s gummy vitamins, and from then on she was hooked. \u201cHer kid gummies were my \u2018gateway drug,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Drexler. \u201cNow I buy the adult ones, and we share those. \u201d Millions of people are hooked on gummies as a health supplement. Gummy multivitamins accounted for 7. 5 percent of the $6 billion multivitamin market in the United States in 2016, according to estimates from the Nutrition Business Journal and projections from IBISWorld, a research company. And gummy products over all now account for $1 billion of the $41 billion supplement market in the United States, a more than 25 percent jump in sales since 2015, according to IBISWorld. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a really nice increase in demand for gummy supplements over the past three to four years,\u201d Doug Jones, the chief merchandise officer at Vitamin Shoppe, which carries a broad assortment of gummy vitamins and supplements, said in an email. Gummy vitamins and supplements originally targeted children, and were offered as a fun way to get kids to take their vitamins. But in 2012, Perrigo, a supplement maker with headquarters in Ireland, began marketing gummy products to adults. Last year, the company announced that it was partnering with Ferrara Candy Company, maker of Trolli Sour Brite Crawlers, to develop multivitamins for adults over 30. One reason gummy vitamins are so popular with adults these days is \u201cpill fatigue. \u201d A 2005 AARP study found that, on average, adults 45 and older said they take four prescription medications daily. But some people say that switching to a gummy version of a vitamin or supplement makes them feel as if they aren\u2019t taking so many pills. Gummies also appeal to people who, like Ms. Drexler, have difficulty swallowing pills. The flavorings in gummy candy can also hide the taste. \u201cVitamins can be nasty,\u201d said Paul Breslin, a professor of nutritional sciences at Rutgers University, and a researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. \u201cSome taste bad. Some can be astringent. A lot of others have foul odors. Gummies are a pleasant way to mask the aversiveness. \u201d But beyond the sweet flavor, humans enjoy chewing, said Mr. Breslin. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, these are dynamic experiences of moving your mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople love to chew it\u2019s in our genes. We buy chewing gum. \u201d But the pleasures of chewing come at a cost. Consumers can take one Nature Made Vitamin C 1, 000 milligram pill costing about 10 cents (a   bottle costs about $30). To get the same amount of vitamin C from a Nature Made gummy vitamin, consumers would need to take eight gummies, at a cost of about 70 cents (a bottle of 80 125 milligram gummies costs $7) And gummy vitamins typically contain one to two grams of sugar each  \u2014   a 1, 000 milligram dose of Nature Made Gummy Vitamin C contains 8 grams of sugar. Some companies have begun offering   versions of gummy vitamins for consumers who prefer a sugar substitute. One issue with the sweet taste of gummy vitamins and supplements is that people might eat too many. \u201cThe only concern I might have is if people are tempted to eat these like candy and end up overdosing on vitamins,\u201d especially \u201cthose that are fat soluble,\u201d which can cause a range of problems if ingested over long periods, said Kim Larson, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Hallie Rich, the president of Alternavites, steered clear of gummies when coming up with her own line of vitamins. \u201cWith the fillers and additives there\u2019s only so much space for active nutrients,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re missing ingredients or they aren\u2019t there in enough quality to make a difference. They are a glorified candy. \u201d Susan Pica agrees. Ms. Pica, 40, the vice president of national sales for an executive transportation company, in Stamford, Conn. saw a gummy vitamin C display at CVS, along with a coupon to \u201cbuy one get one free. \u201d She had fond memories of the Flintstones chewables she took as a child, so she thought she\u2019d try them. \u201cI felt like I was eating Sour Patch Kids,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019How can these be good for you? My teeth actually hurt from eating them. \u201d After seeing sugar sprinkled on the vitamins and settled at the bottom of the bottle, she checked the ingredients on the label. The bottle listed sugar, corn syrup and sodium citrate among the ingredients. \u201cI decided to use the gummy vitamins as a treat, like candy,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what they are  \u2014   candy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564423.2328806}
