Mr. Spicer later apologized. During his daily briefing for reporters, Mr. Spicer was defending President Trump\u2019s decision to order a missile strike on Syria by trying to lend gravity to the actions of Mr. Assad. American officials accuse the Syrian president of using sarin gas, a lethal chemical weapon, in an attack on a   area of Idlib Province last week that killed dozens, many of them children. But in misconstruing the facts of the Holocaust  \u2014   Nazi Germany\u2019s brutally efficient, carefully orchestrated extermination of six million Jews and others  \u2014   Mr. Spicer instead drew a torrent of criticism and added to the perception that the Trump White House lacks sensitivity and has a tenuous grasp of history. \u201cWe didn\u2019t use chemical weapons in World War II,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cYou know, you had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn\u2019t even sink to using chemical weapons. \u201d He continued, \u201cSo you have to, if you are Russia, ask yourself: Is this a country and a regime that you want to align yourself with?\u201d The White House charged Tuesday that Russia had sought to cover up the Syrian government\u2019s role in the chemical attack. Asked to clarify his remarks, Mr. Spicer then acknowledged that Hitler had used chemical agents, but maintained that there was a difference. \u201cI think when you come to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, incorrectly, before mentioning \u201cHolocaust centers,\u201d an apparent reference to Nazi death camps. 160, 000 to 180, 000 Jews killed by the Nazis were from Germany, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Mr. Spicer\u2019s explanation drew gasps from reporters in the briefing room. The remarks almost immediately elicited outrage on social media and correctives from scholars of the Holocaust. \u201cHistorically, it\u2019s just wrong,\u201d said Deborah Lipstadt, a leading historian of the Holocaust and a professor at Emory University in Atlanta. Mr. Spicer \u201cshould not be making comparisons,\u201d Dr. Lipstadt said. \u201cIt\u2019s, at the best, not thought out, and at the worst, shows a latent  . \u201d Shortly after his briefing, Mr. Spicer again tried to clarify his comments, saying in a statement that he was not \u201ctrying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. \u201d \u201cI was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers,\u201d he said. \u201cAny attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable. \u201d But the clarification did not quiet calls from some corners, including from Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, for Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Spicer. By Tuesday evening, Mr. Spicer was on CNN, offering a contrite apology. \u201cI was trying to draw a comparison for which there shouldn\u2019t have been one,\u201d he said. The Trump administration has a history of missteps on the Holocaust. Days after Mr. Trump took office, a White House statement marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day was sharply criticized  for failing to directly mention Jews or  . Nor was Tuesday the only time Mr. Spicer has shown a hazy understanding of world events or appeared not to understand the implications of his words. On Monday, he said that the president would retaliate against Syria not only if it used chemical weapons, but also barrel bombs. \u201cIf you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people, I think you will see a response from this president,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. Barrel bombs are the Assad government\u2019s preferred tool of mass killing Syrian forces dropped more than 12, 000 of them in 2016, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights. Mr. Spicer\u2019s comments, if taken literally, would signal a much broader American intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war. Mr. Spicer also said twice on Tuesday that Iran was a \u201cfailed state,\u201d lumping it in with North Korea and Syria. Iran, though an adversary of the United States with a history of repression, is a robust, functioning state.'"}, "time": 1742563340.910997}
