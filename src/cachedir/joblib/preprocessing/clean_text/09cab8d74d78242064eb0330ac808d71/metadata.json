[\u201cThe centerpiece of the panel discussions is a series titled \u2018Tech Under Trump,\u2019\u201d reported The Hill on Saturday, adding that the panel discussions \u201caren\u2019t pulling any punches. \u201d  \u201cNPR reporter Sam Sanders is hosting an event titled the \u20182016 Election: How We Got it Wrong! ,\u2019 reflecting on his experiences covering the 2016 presidential race,\u201d they continued. \u201cAnother discussion titled \u2018Building Bridges When Others Want to Build Walls,\u2019 is intended to highlight the uncertainty facing immigrants. One panel is discussing \u2018From Trump to Trolls: How Muslim Media Fights Back. \u2019\u201d \u201cSome of the panels aren\u2019t   but do highlight the tech industry\u2019s policy priorities, including a discussion titled \u2018Can You Hear Me Now? The Rural Broadband Debate,\u2019 featuring Rep. Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez ( ) and Information Technology Industry Council President Dean Garfield,\u201d The Hill concluded. \u201cEven the festival\u2019s art and music events are taking on a stronger political tone than in years past. One music showcase is titled \u2018Contrabanned,\u2019 and will feature acts from countries including Libya and Somalia, whose citizens are banned from entering the U. S. under Trump\u2019s travel executive order. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen in my lifetime an atmosphere of fear as I\u2019ve seen now,\u201d said Sen. Cory Booker at the festival. \u201cI feel a sense of pain about my country right now. \u201c[Trump] isn\u2019t backing away from his rhetoric. But if we don\u2019t engage, we are the source of the problem, not the elected person we don\u2019t like,\u201d he added. In a SXSW session titled \u201cDark Days: AI and the Rise of Fascism,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Kate Crawford even attempted to compare the rise of artificial intelligence with fascism. \u201cJust as we are seeing a step function increase in the spread of AI, something else is happening: the rise of   rightwing authoritarianism and fascism,\u201d Crawford declared. \u201cWe should always be suspicious when machine learning systems are described as free from bias if it\u2019s been trained on   data. Our biases are built into that training data. \u201d SXSW\u2019s chief programming officer Hugh Forrest praised the political slant on this year\u2019s festival. \u201cThere is definitely a degree of politics or political focus that may not have been there in previous years,\u201d said Forrest. \u201cWe hope people walk away with a little better understanding of issues and the players driving the issues. \u201d Forrest, who voted for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, previously claimed to be \u201cgrieving\u201d following President Trump\u2019s victory in November. He also claimed to be excited about SXSW\u2019s \u201crole\u201d in \u201cpaving a more progressive path to the future. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
