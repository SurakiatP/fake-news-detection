[Schumer lost his temper when dining at Upper East Side restaurant Sette Mezzo, the New York Post\u2019s Page Six reported.  The top Senate Democrat was dining with friends when he ran into former U. S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr. and his wife, Hilary, at the restaurant. Witnesses say that Schumer became incensed that Hilary, daughter of CBS founder and chairman William S. Paley, voted for Trump, though her husband is a prominent Democrat. \u201cThey are a highly respected couple, and Schumer made a scene, yelling, \u2018She voted for Trump!\u2019 The Califanos left the restaurant, but Schumer followed them outside,\u201d one witness said of the encounter. \u201cHow could you vote for Trump? He\u2019s a liar! He\u2019s a liar!\u201d Schumer reportedly yelled. Hilary confirmed the encounter with Schumer and called the senator\u2019s actions \u201creally rude. \u201d \u201cSen. Schumer was really rude   \u2026     He\u2019s our senator, and I don\u2019t really like him. Yes, I voted for Trump. Schumer joined us outside and he told me Trump was a liar. I should have told him that Hillary Clinton was a liar, but I was so surprised I didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Hilary said. Another witness told a different story about Schumer\u2019s encounter with the couple, saying the senator approached the couple\u2019s table first. \u201cIt was a pleasant conversation. Joe said the senator was doing a good job on health care. Joe joked that Hilary voted for Trump. The conversation continued outside because everyone left at the same time,\u201d the witness said. In a statement, Schumer\u2019s spokesperson denied that there was a heated encounter at the restaurant. \u201c[He] and his wife ate at the caf\u00e9 on Sunday, engaging in unremarkable conversation with patrons who approached their table. There were no heated exchanges with \\u200eanyone,\u201d the spokesperson said. Schumer has railed against the Trump administration, saying Sunday that President Trump\u2019s proposal for a border wall will not get votes from Republicans or Democrats. He also called on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( ) to replace House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Devin Nunes ( ) and announced that Senate Democrats will filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court.'"}, "time": 1742628313.798416}
