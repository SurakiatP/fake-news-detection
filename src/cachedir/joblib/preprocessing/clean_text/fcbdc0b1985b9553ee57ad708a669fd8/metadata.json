Ten abortion clinics that had been in danger of being forced to close  \u2014   about half those still in existence  \u2014   will be allowed to continue operating. The reopening of clinics that already shut their doors became a possibility. And some original opponents of the law  \u2014   including Wendy Davis, the former state senator whose filibuster of the bill brought national attention to the restrictions and set the stage for her unsuccessful bid for governor  \u2014   spoke of feeling vindicated and rejuvenated. \u201cMy immediate reaction literally was to burst into tears,\u201d Ms. Davis said on Monday, two days after the third anniversary of the filibuster. \u201cThere was so much riding on this. \u201d Now, after years of the clinics being under siege, there are two main questions about abortion options in the state: Will shuttered clinics reopen, particularly outside the biggest urban areas? And how will Republicans in the Legislature respond to a stinging judicial reversal after a period in which access to abortion has been dramatically reduced? Had the Supreme Court sided with Texas and the 10 clinics closed, the country\u2019s   state by population and by size would have been left with nine abortion facilities. A decision upholding the law would have allowed the measure to be fully put into effect for the first time since the   Legislature passed it in July 2013, and would have shut four clinics in Houston, two in El Paso and one each in Austin, Fort Worth and San Antonio, as well as one in McAllen temporarily. Republican leaders quickly condemned the ruling. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, whose lawyers defended the state in the case, said in a statement on Monday that the law was \u201can effort to improve minimum safety standards and ensure capable care for Texas women. \u201d He said the ruling took \u201cthe ability to protect women\u2019s health out of the hands of Texas citizens and their duly elected representatives. \u201d Two of the law\u2019s four provisions were ruled unconstitutional. One required clinic doctors performing abortions to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and the other mandated that all clinics, even those that provided nonsurgical medication abortions, meet the same standards as   surgical centers. Three provisions, including the   requirement, had been in place statewide with only a few exceptions. The   rules had never been enforced, because of litigation. Much remained unclear after the ruling, including how many abortion clinics that had closed would reopen and when. Abortion rights advocates said that shuttered clinics would not open again immediately and that it might take years for new clinics to establish themselves. In May 2013, two months before Gov. Rick Perry signed the bill into law, Texas had 41 facilities providing abortions. In November 2013, after the   requirement was put in place, there were 22. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to let leases go or sell buildings that had mortgages,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the president and chief executive of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates abortion clinics in Texas and was the lead plaintiff. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find physicians and rehire staff and go through relicensing processes, and get equipment and instruments and medicine. It\u2019s not something that is going to happen overnight. \u201d Nan Little Kirkpatrick, the executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which provides financial assistance to women seeking abortions in the northern half of the state, predicted that some clinics would reopen, especially in the Panhandle region, which has none. \u201cOne reason we saw providers close was because they couldn\u2019t get staff to stay on, with their jobs completely up in the air,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that we have some assurance from the Supreme Court, I think it will be easier for providers to attract and keep staff. \u201d Supporters of the law said it was too early to say what their next steps would be, but they appeared to show no signs of signaling defeat. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican who serves as the president of the Texas Senate, vowed to have senators \u201crevisit\u201d the issue. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go through this line by line and see what it is that we can address in a way that a Supreme Court would approve,\u201d Mr. Patrick said. \u201cI\u2019m clearly   but if someone\u2019s going to have an abortion, I want them to have it in the safest possible environment. \u201d Texas had been experiencing what critics of the law called an \u201cabortion access crisis,\u201d with 19 clinics in a state with 5. 4 million women of reproductive age. If that number had fallen to nine, abortion rights advocates said, the remaining clinics could not have met demand. Waits for appointments would have increased, they said, and more women would have attempted to   abortions using   drugs. There had been much confusion and uncertainty among women seeking abortions in Texas. Reproductive Services, one of two abortion clinics in El Paso, closed in June 2014, but reopened at a new location last fall after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked full enforcement of the law. \u201cSome of the other clinics may be able to reopen, but it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Gerri Laster, the clinic\u2019s executive administrator. \u201cWe went down that road, and it took us almost six months to get our license back. And that was after having a license for 25 years with no deficiencies, meeting all the state requirements. \u201d Ms. Laster said her clinic sold all its equipment when it closed, expecting it would be impossible to reopen. It spent $50, 000 to $100, 000 to get back in business, she added. The clinic used to see about 40 patients a week but now sees 20, largely because many women are unaware it reopened, she said. Had Reproductive Services and the other El Paso clinic closed, women there would have had to go to New Mexico or drive more than 500 miles to the nearest clinic in Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s like a rock has been released from our stomachs,\u201d Ms. Laster said.'"}, "time": 1742628472.7063324}
