The decision almost certainly ends the legal battle in Poland over how to deal with Mr. Polanski, although as a practical matter, even a ruling in favor of the government would have had little effect. Mr. Polanski, a dual citizen of France and Poland, lives in France, which does not extradite its citizens. Judge Michal Laskowski ruled that a lower court\u2019s verdict was not a \u201cflagrant violation of the law,\u201d as the request for an appeal had claimed. \u201cThe regional court of Krakow considered and verified all evidence exceptionally carefully,\u201d Judge Laskowski said. The legal effort reflects a broader push by the conservative Law and Justice government, which since coming to power a year ago has been calling for a return to Roman Catholic values in Poland, to try to reinforce its reputation as a    party. The ruling on Tuesday came six months after the chief prosecutor and justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, asked the court to overrule the earlier verdict as the government sought to extradite Mr. Polanski, whom authorities in the United States have wanted for decades. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said that Mr. Ziobro \u201caccepts and respects\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, although he still \u201ctakes the position that proceedings concerning sexual abuse of minors should be enforced consistently\u201d regardless of who committed the crime, or when it occurred. Mr. Polanski was arrested in 1977 on charges that included the rape of the teenager at the Los Angeles home of Jack Nicholson, the actor. In 1978, Mr. Polanski left the United States on the eve of sentencing under an agreement by which he was to plead guilty to a count of statutory rape. In October 2015, a judge in Krakow, Poland, ruled that turning over Mr. Polanski would be an \u201cobviously unlawful\u201d deprivation of liberty, saying that the State of California, where he was convicted, was unlikely to conduct a fair trial and provide humane conditions of confinement for the director, who was 82 at the time. The Krakow prosecutor\u2019s office, which had sought Mr. Polanski\u2019s extradition on behalf of Los Angeles County, said a month later that it would abide by the judge\u2019s ruling. But Mr. Ziobro appealed the decision to the Supreme Court at the end of May, calling the trial judge\u2019s ruling \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and a \u201cserious breach\u201d of the extradition agreement between Poland and the United States. Mr. Ziobro said in an interview with Polish state radio in May that Mr. Polanski had received preferential treatment because of his fame. \u201cIf he was just a regular guy, a teacher, doctor, plumber, decorator, then I\u2019m confident that he\u2019d have been deported from any country to the U. S. a long time ago,\u201d he said. In his opening statement on Tuesday, Jan Olszewski, a lawyer for Mr. Polanski, recalled how the Swiss authorities had declined in 2010 to extradite Mr. Polanski, who directed \u201cChinatown,\u201d because of doubts over the conduct of the judge in his original trial. Jerzy Stachowicz, another lawyer for Mr. Polanski, argued in court that his client had not technically fled the United States because he had never been prohibited from leaving. \u201cMr. Polanski didn\u2019t flee, as it is believed,\u201d Mr. Stachowicz said. \u201cHe simply bought a plane ticket, checked in his luggage and boarded a plane. It was not fleeing. \u201d Referring to Mr. Ziobro\u2019s argument, Mr. Stachowicz said, \u201cIf Mr. Polanski were not a celebrity, a famous filmmaker, but he was an average Joe, this case would have been over long ago, and nobody would have ever heard of it. \u201d The Supreme Court ruling means that Mr. Polanski, now 83, would be free to work in Poland. He has been planning to make a film about Alfred Dreyfus, a French Jew who was wrongly accused of spying and whose case raised a debate in the late 19th century about prosecutorial misconduct. The film, \u201cAn Officer and a Spy,\u201d was to be shot in Poland, but it was announced in June that Mr. Polanski had decided to make it in France. That prompted speculation that his legal problems had led him to move production of the film, but Robert Benmussa, the film\u2019s producer, attributed the decision to French tax incentives, according to The Los Angeles Times. Mr. Polanski, who lives with his wife in France, was not in court on Tuesday. \u201cThis is just too emotional for him,\u201d Mr. Stachowicz said by telephone on Monday, before the ruling. \u201cThis has been going on for such a long time. A ruling against overruling the first verdict would be a great relief for him. \u201d After the ruling, Mr. Olszewski, the lawyer, said that he had spoken with Mr. Polanski on the phone. \u201cHe is currently in France, where he is shooting his new film,\u201d Mr. Olszewski said. \u201cHe is beyond happy that this is finally over. At least in Poland. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564411.7438884}
