Seemingly in response to the window being broken the vehicle lunges forward, then backward, in an apparent attempt to flee from officers \u2013 who can be heard yelling \u201cstop\u201d repeatedly. \\nKenney then came to a stop at the traffic lights momentarily, as police continued to command him to stop the vehicle. As an officer approached the driver side door, the vehicle abruptly takes off down the street with officers giving chase. \\nAccording to Photography is Not a Crime : \\nDaniel Kenney, who is listed as a state park peace officer supervisor, was then handed over to his department, who promptly placed him on paid administrative leave. \\nKenney, a K-9 officer who made more than $95,000 last year, was the recipient of the 2012 Top Dog Award along with his dog Kilo for \u201cdemonstrating the best discipline, teamwork, and overall skills.\u201d \\nIt is not clear if Kilo was in the car with him as he made his getaway but the video shows the words \u201cK-9 Unit, Stay Back\u201d on the side of his patrol car. \\nMeanwhile, a man sitting inside the parked vehicle that was struck by Kenney\u2019s patrol car was also transported to the hospital with minor injuries, according to Action News Now. \\nThe incident was so bizarre that the individual filming can be heard wrongly making the assumption that a civilian was driving the vehicle, most likely believing the vehicle was stolen. Eventually, Kenney was pulled over and placed in handcuffs \u2013 and after being found to not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs \u2013 he was released to state park supervisors and taken to a hospital for evaluation. \\nThe fact that this man was not arrested seemingly speaks to there being a separate set of rules for law enforcement, than for the rest of society. Although perhaps there were mitigating circumstances that haven\u2019t been made public, there is a stark appearance of impropriety. Kenney has not been arrested or charged with anything, but has been put on paid administrative leave. \\nThe reality is that if this had been a civilian driving the vehicle the police would likely have shot and killed the driver and claimed they feared for their lives \u2014 as we have seen happen numerous times . \\nDo you think you would receive the same treatment as this man in similar circumstances?
