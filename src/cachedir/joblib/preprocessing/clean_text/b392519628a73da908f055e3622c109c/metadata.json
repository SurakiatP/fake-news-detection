For months, friends said, Salaam had been a recluse who left his rented condo in a Denver suburb only occasionally, to buy groceries and, even more rarely, for a solitary morning walk. Now and then he went to a bar for drinks and a steak, sitting by himself. But on this Monday night, Dec. 5, Salaam, a former football standout, was headed for the site of his greatest triumph. From his home, it was eight miles to the University of Colorado in Boulder, where Salaam was a running back who won the Heisman Trophy in 1994. On the final dash of his last game at Folsom Field here that year, Salaam roared 67 yards for a touchdown, collapsing in the end zone and spurring his teammates to hoist him onto their shoulders as fans waved \u201c2000\u201d signs he had become just the fourth college player to exceed 2, 000 rushing yards in a season. Now, on an unseasonably warm December night, he drove past the stadium and cut through the heart of the idyllic Colorado campus, where, he often said, he still felt most comfortable. Less than two miles from where he had scored his   touchdown, he pulled into the tiny parking area of Eben G. Fine Park, bordering the burbling Boulder Creek. Around 8 p. m. a few hours after the voting closed for the 2016 Heisman and five days before the 22nd anniversary of Salaam\u2019s trophy win, a young man walking in the park saw a body lying beside an idling sedan. Salaam. A revolver lay nearby. Salaam\u2019s death at the age of 42 is being investigated as a likely suicide. Autopsy results are expected in about a month. But in the days since the death, as friends, relatives and associates puzzle over the circumstances, they cannot help but wonder if the Heisman and its attendant expectations of fame had undercut his life instead of elevating it. \u201cRashaan came back to Boulder a few years ago to revive himself,\u201d said Francisco Lujan, one of Salaam\u2019s close friends and a business associate. \u201cHe was trying to find a way to find himself. He returned to where the memories were good. \u201d T . J. Cunningham, a Colorado teammate who had stayed in touch with Salaam until a few months ago, said he believed Salaam\u2019s football career, which sputtered after he left college largely because of injuries, always weighed on him. \u201cRashaan was 20 years old when he won the Heisman Trophy,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cTo achieve the epitome of success at 20, but then you can\u2019t get to that point again  \u2014   what did that do to Rashaan?\u201d That may be an insoluble question. For people who knew him, the prospect that he took his own life is hard to reconcile with someone best known for an infectious smile that brightened a room when he entered it. As Cunningham said: \u201cHe was a happy guy. I can still see him at Christmas last year, at my house teaching my    how to hit a baseball. But, you know, Rashaan struggled with some things. \u201d Many of his friends believed he suffered from depression and mood swings, typical signs of the brain disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C. T. E. that has afflicted scores of players. The disease is linked to repeated hits to the head and diagnosed posthumously, but it is unclear if Salaam\u2019s family members have donated his brain to be tested. The Salaam family declined to be interviewed for this article, and multiple phone messages and email messages left for relatives drew no response. Salaam\u2019s brother, Jabali Alaji, told USA Today shortly after Rashaan\u2019s funeral on Dec. 9 that if Salaam\u2019s brain were examined: \u201cI would guarantee they\u2019d find it. I would guarantee it. \u201d But several of Salaam\u2019s friends who spoke with family members said they were told Salaam\u2019s brain would not be tested. Though injured often, Salaam had no known history of repeated concussions or head trauma. But as Cunningham said: \u201cRashaan had a lot of collisions. He wasn\u2019t a fake and juke guy he ran right through you. \u201cC. T. E.? He showed all the symptoms,\u201d Cunningham said, \u201cand C. T. E. probably added to that. \u201d Whatever the cause, it was obvious to people around him that Salaam was dealing with mental health problems. He routinely retreated to his condo and stayed there. Phone calls and texts from friends went unreturned for days or weeks, especially since October. Salaam spent Thanksgiving by himself, a   neighbor said, in his small, plain   condo next to a playground and a municipal wastewater plant in Superior, Colo. \u201cHe was always in his condo,\u201d said the neighbor, Deanna Ardrey. \u201cHe would sit there by himself every day. You knew there was something off. \u201d Riley Robert Hawkins, a school social worker and behavioral therapist who had been a partner with Salaam in a charitable foundation since 2011, talked to him about whether he should seek treatment for depression. \u201cYou could tell he was fighting some things,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cAnxiety and depression, that\u2019s bipolar. It was always there to some degree. \u201cLike many of us,\u201d he said, \u201cI think he thought he had a handle on things. \u201d Maurice Henriques, another Colorado teammate who had remained close with Salaam, said it was impossible to pinpoint what ailed him. \u201cFor the family\u2019s sake, you\u2019d love for there to be an explanation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s probably a cocktail of things  \u2014   depression, some C. T. E. and Rashaan still trying to deal with the transition from football. \u201cHow,\u201d he added, \u201cdo you   yourself?\u201d When he was first handed the Heisman in 1994, Salaam had no idea how much the   trophy would complicate the rest of his life. Going forward, it distorted the perception of his career. Salaam had a spectacular N. F. L. rookie season with the Chicago Bears but faded markedly thereafter, lasting for only four seasons. After that, he more and more kept his distance from the trophy, whose renowned pose is a stiff arm. \u201cHe felt people viewed him as a failure,\u201d said David Plati, an associate athletic director at Colorado and a friend of Salaam\u2019s for nearly a  . \u201cHe was frustrated with his N. F. L. career. That\u2019s the burden the Heisman carries. He felt pressure that he had to go do something in the pros as good or greater than what he did in college. \u201cHe felt that people were looking at him, thinking that he let them down. \u201d Still, the Heisman loomed large. Everybody wanted to see it and touch it. Salaam wanted to stand apart from it. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the trophy itself,\u201d Lujan said. \u201cWhen he was making an appearance, people would always ask if he could bring the Heisman Trophy to the engagement. He\u2019d turn them down. He didn\u2019t like carrying the trophy around. It made him feel like the only reason anyone wanted to see him was because he had a Heisman Trophy. \u201d Once, visiting Salaam at his home, a friend saw the trophy being used as a doorstop. For the majority of the last 22 years, Salaam\u2019s mother kept the trophy at the family home in San Diego. Salaam was conflicted about the trophy from the start he declined to do several major interviews the year he won it. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. Deep down Rashaan didn\u2019t care about the trophy and never did because he didn\u2019t like being singled out,\u201d Plati said. \u201cRashaan wanted to be just one of the guys,\u201d Plati said. \u201cBut he knew his offensive linemen wanted him to win the Heisman. He understood it was important for the university and the football program. \u201d Salaam is Colorado\u2019s only Heisman winner and eventually got into the experience of winning it, even enjoying the week in New York for the ceremony. At the time, it seemed like a     thing  \u2014   not a lifetime designation permanently attached to his name. He had won the trophy in his junior year and entered the 1995 N. F. L. draft. Yet he was perturbed, even insulted, when he was the fifth running back taken in the first round. But Salaam had proved others wrong in his career before. With his mother urging him on, he had left his hometown, San Diego, and traveled by bus two hours daily to attend La Jolla Country Day, a private school where he excelled academically and on the football team. But La Jolla played   football, and Salaam was barely noticed by college recruiters. His La Jolla coach mounted a campaign to promote him, and soon Colorado took him on. He was, however, on the third string as a college freshman. Though he was a sturdy    and weighed in at 220 pounds, there were doubts about whether he had the speed to compete at the highest level of college ball. He made progress as a sophomore, and by his spectacular junior season at Colorado had more than vanquished his critics. And yet, N. F. L. evaluators still had reservations, which is how Salaam fell to the draft\u2019s 21st pick. As a rookie, Salaam rushed for 1, 074 yards and 10 touchdowns, becoming the youngest N. F. L. player to rush for more than 1, 000 yards. But a series of leg injuries limited his playing time and effectiveness in the next two seasons, his last with the Bears. In 1999, he carried the football once for 2 yards for the hapless   Cleveland Browns. He was also briefly with two other N. F. L. teams but never got on the field. In 2001, Salaam played for the Memphis Maniax of the   X. F. L. At 28, he regrouped and spent nearly a year getting in top shape because the San Francisco 49ers had invited him to training camp. Around that time in 2003, in an interview with ESPN, Salaam decided to open up about his marijuana use while with the Bears. He said he was too young to handle the money and success of his early N. F. L. career and blamed an undisciplined lifestyle for hampering his development as a professional. Salaam later said he had hoped the interview would show a newfound maturity, since he was admitting to a mistake and describing a new, robust work ethic. But the reaction to the interview, and to Salaam, was decidedly negative. He was cut by the 49ers toward the end of training camp. After a   flirtation with the Canadian Football League, his football career was over. Salaam said in interviews years ago that he had invested much of his nearly $4 million N. F. L. payday with a San Diego brokerage firm. Shortly after retiring from football, Salaam began spending months in China, where he started a mixed martial arts business. None of his friends were sure how or why he made a connection with China, but there he promoted championship events and shuttled between his native California and Beijing. By the beginning of this decade, he sold the   venture and returned to San Diego. There, Salaam lived quietly, and mostly, anonymously. A   \u201cbachelor for life,\u201d Salaam never married, although his friends said they had met his various girlfriends over the years. About five years ago, Salaam decided to return to the Boulder area in what was viewed as an attempt to regain his footing in a familiar place. He began working with Lujan, a coach at a local high school, who had a   company that did testing for N. F. L. and C. F. L. scouting combines. Salaam was paid $2, 500 or more for public appearances and helped with the testing. He appeared financially secure. While he did not live extravagantly  \u2014   rent at his condo this year was about $1, 500 a month  \u2014   he never seemed in need of funds. A 2011 newspaper account reported that Salaam sold ornate rings he had received for winning the Heisman Trophy for roughly $9, 000. Salaam said that the rings were sold, without his knowledge, by a family member. \u201cRashaan\u2019s primary goal when he came here was to start a foundation to help   youth,\u201d said Lujan, who eventually put Salaam in touch with Hawkins, the school social worker, who years earlier had founded the SPIN Foundation  \u2014   Supporting People in Need. Together, Hawkins and Salaam planned events, camps, clinics and appearances, and they devised programs to benefit underprivileged children. Salaam became a fixture at Jefferson High School in Edgewater, Colo. where Hawkins has worked for 15 years. Salaam regularly spoke with classes and worked with students individually and in groups. For four days in April 2015, for example, the foundation brought about 30 Jefferson students and staff members to the ski slopes of Aspen for a trip that was called a \u201cSki for the Heisman\u201d program. \u201cRashaan was like a family member to Jefferson students,\u201d said Oscar Lopez, a senior at the high school who participated in the trip. \u201cHe was like a big brother and he was always encouraging us to better ourselves. He talked about the mistakes he made and how he kept going. His big message was to stay positive. \u201d Lopez, who is a wrestler and football player, said Salaam once cautioned him about taking care of his body in athletics. \u201cHe told me if I was hurt, to protect myself and stay off the field,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cHe had injuries and went back out there. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t do that, let it heal. \u2019\u201d Lujan said the cost of the Aspen trip was $25, 000. At Jefferson High, students who had laughed on the Aspen slopes with Salaam and been buoyed by his enthusiasm for their future prospects were thunderstruck by his death. \u201cI broke down because he was always here for us,\u201d said Janessa Kiome, a senior at Jefferson. \u201cAnd that night, no one was there for him. \u201d Hawkins and others have been counseling the Jefferson students. Seated in his school office last week, Hawkins sighed and said: \u201cRashaan was trying to save lives, but he had trouble saving his own life. There are things we can explain and things that we can\u2019t explain. \u201d It had been hard to get to know Salaam well, as he was introverted by nature and something of a loner, especially in the last few months. He was a semiregular at C. B.  Potts, a bar and restaurant about a mile from his condo in Superior. He usually came in around 10 on Sunday nights, well past the dinner rush. He was always alone, and he would sit in a section of the bar unoccupied by other patrons, ordering a steak and two or three vodka drinks known as Moscow Mules. \u201cHe was always nice to everyone,\u201d said Chris Rosa, a bartender there who works Sunday nights. \u201cBut more than a few times, we\u2019d be talking and he\u2019d say he was mad that injuries and bad luck messed up his N. F. L. career. He said things spiraled out of control and he wished things had been different. \u201d Rosa said he had not seen him in the last couple of months. Neither had his friends or the people he worked with, like Lujan and Hawkins. \u201cEveryone has the same story,\u201d Lujan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked each other, \u2018When did you last hear from him?\u2019 And everyone answers, \u2018About a month or six weeks ago. \u2019\u201d Salaam\u2019s neighbor Deanna Ardrey was among the few who saw him regularly during this period. She had met Salaam a few months earlier when she moved in with her boyfriend. She learned only by accident that Salaam had played football, then Googled him and was dumbfounded to discover his celebrity. \u201cWe talked about football, but he was more likely to talk about other things, like astronomy,\u201d Ardrey said. \u201cHe was always pointing out planets to us in the sky. \u201d On sunny days, Salaam kept his front door open and Ardrey would hear music playing. In the fall and winter, Salaam\u2019s television would be tuned to football games. \u201cWe would hear him watching games all night and yelling at the TV,\u201d Ardrey said. \u201cBut I mean, he was always there by himself. Every day, every night. His car was always in the driveway. \u201d In the days before his death, Ardrey noticed something unusual: His car was frequently gone at night. \u201cIn the last few days, I\u2019ve been thinking: How many times did he go to that park thinking he might  \u2014   and then changed his mind?\u201d Ardrey wondered last week. On the morning of Dec. 5, Ardrey saw her neighbor as she got in her car and waved at him. He waved back and smiled. Much later, he drove away from the condo, leaving a light on in the living room.'"}, "time": 1742564209.804575}
