So for some experts who study terrorism, President Trump\u2019s assertion this week that the news media has actually been ignoring and covering up terrorist attacks came as a surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s totally astonishing,\u201d said Martha Crenshaw, a Stanford scholar who has written on terrorism since the 1970s. \u201cIt has no basis in fact whatsoever. The criticism has always gone the other way. \u201d Other experts said Mr. Trump\u2019s claim had less to do with the facts about terrorism coverage than with the new administration\u2019s political goals, notably defending his executive order that temporarily bans refugees and visitors from some Muslim countries. In the face of the onslaught of legal challenges and outspoken opposition to the order, they said, the president has an interest in persuading Americans that the terrorist threat from abroad is worse than the news media has revealed. Years of books and articles critiquing the \u201csymbiosis\u201d of terrorism and news media coverage have pointed out that terrorists usually seek to promote a political or ideological cause and use spectacular violence with the specific goal of attracting attention. News executives, while sometimes expressing mixed feelings about giving terrorists what they seek, have generally felt obligated to give such attacks ample coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to say that the media does not give enough attention to terrorism,\u201d said David C. Rapoport, a retired U. C. L. A. political science professor considered a founder of terrorism studies. He said modern global terrorism arose in the 1880s in Russia in parallel with, and partly owing to, the rise of mass daily newspapers. In the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, even failed terrorist plots often have drawn saturation coverage  \u2014   think of the fizzled   underwear bomb on a   airliner on Christmas Day 2009 or the S. U. V.   to blow up that produced only smoke in Times Square on a May night in 2010. Though no target was harmed, both attempts drew mountains of coverage, much of it focused on how terrorists went undetected. But in an appearance Monday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. Mr. Trump reviewed the horrors of more recent attacks, including those inspired or directed by the Islamic State, and pronounced the coverage inadequate. \u201cRadical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on   as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino,\u201d he said at the headquarters of Central Command, which carries out military operations in the Middle East. \u201cAll over Europe it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s gotten to a point where it\u2019s not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn\u2019t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that. \u201d The president did not explain the reasons he believed journalists might have for not reporting Islamist terrorism. But in response to a wave of skeptical comment, the White House on Monday night released a list of 78 attacks around the world since September 2014. \u201cMost have not received the media attention they deserved,\u201d the accompanying statement said. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, stood by the point on Tuesday, though adjusting the language. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming too often that we\u2019re seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention that they deserve,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around this country. \u201d It was a subjective judgment only a dozen of the 78 listed attacks occurred in the United States, and most resulted in few or no deaths, reducing their prominence in American news reports. The list omitted terrorist attacks by   including white supremacists like Dylann S. Roof, who killed nine   at a Charleston, S. C. church in 2015. But news databases show virtually all 78 attacks got some coverage, and the big attacks in Paris Brussels Boston San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. played out for days or weeks on cable television and news sites. Peter D. Feaver, a political scientist at Duke who studies public opinion on national security issues, said he saw no basis for the White House claims. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s evidence of the press underreporting terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe corporate incentives run the other way. \u201d But Mr. Feaver, who served in the George W. Bush White House but publicly opposed Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, said the president\u2019s remarks, if not literally true, nonetheless play out in a larger, partisan debate about terrorism. Democrats sometimes accused the Bush administration of exaggerating the terrorist threat. Republicans often charged President Barack Obama of minimizing the danger and embellishing his own successes against Al Qaeda. By suggesting that the news media is hiding the truth about the menace from \u201cradical Islamic terrorists,\u201d Mr. Trump may rally his base behind the executive order and other measures still to come. Mr. Spicer suggested as much, saying the executive order and the president\u2019s remarks in Tampa have the same motive: \u201cbecause he cares about making sure that we don\u2019t have attacks in this country, that we\u2019re protected. \u201d Mr. Trump wants Americans, he said, to \u201cunderstand the unwavering commitment that the president has and the actions that he will take to keep the country safe. \u201d Preventing terrorist attacks is, of course, a goal that is pretty much universally shared. But Mr. Trump\u2019s loose relationship with facts, and his eagerness to fault journalists and judges, make some think he has a less lofty goal as well: to find scapegoats for terrorist attacks that sooner or later are certain to happen. \u201c  blame,\u201d said Ms. Crenshaw, the Stanford terrorism researcher. \u201cNothing\u2019s happened. But if something does happen, he can blame the judiciary and the news media. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563921.3412118}
