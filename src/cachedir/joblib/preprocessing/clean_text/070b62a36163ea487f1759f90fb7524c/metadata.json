In   parts of the Arctic were more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than observed averages, scientists said, and at the pole itself, mean temperatures for the month were 23 degrees above normal. Although conditions later cooled somewhat, the extreme warmth is expected to return, with temperatures forecast to be as much as 27 degrees above normal beginning Thursday. Jeremy Mathis, who directs the Arctic Research Program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the warmth had led to a later than usual \u201c \u201d of ice in the Arctic Ocean. That in turn may lead to   ice coverage in the spring and summer, which could lead to more warming because there will be less ice to reflect the sun\u2019s rays and more darker, exposed ocean to absorb them. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be watching the summer of 2017 very closely,\u201d Dr. Mathis said in an interview. On Wednesday, researchers released a study linking the abnormally high Arctic temperatures to   climate change. Using simulations of the climate, both current and before widespread carbon emissions, they found that the likelihood of extreme temperatures like those that occurred this fall had increased to about once every 50 years from about once every 1, 000 years. \u201cA warm episode like the one we are currently observing is still a rare event in today\u2019s climate,\u201d said one of the researchers, Friederike E. L. Otto, a senior scientist at the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford in Britain. \u201cBut it would have been an extremely unlikely event without anthropogenic climate change. \u201d What\u2019s more, Dr. Otto said, if climate change continues at its current pace, spates of extreme Arctic warmth may become common, on the order of once every two years. \u201cIt\u2019s quite impressive how much the risk of these kinds of events is changing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one region where we see the impacts of climate change very strongly. \u201d Walt Meier, a research scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, said that the current warmth had been brought on by fluctuations in the jet stream, which have allowed frigid air to make its way south into North America and warm air into parts of the Arctic. While such outbreaks of extreme warmth are not new, he said, there are many signs that climate change is making them more frequent. \u201cWe\u2019re loading the dice to make this more likely,\u201d he said. While the earth over all has been warming  \u2014   2015 set a record for warmth, and 2016 is expected to exceed it  \u2014   the Arctic has been warming at least twice as fast as the global average. In part, scientists say, that is because of declines in sea ice coverage. Ice typically reflects from about half to 70 percent of the solar energy that hits it, but water reflects only 6 percent, and so the water warms up. That melts more ice, which in turn leads to more exposed ocean and still more melting  \u2014   what\u2019s known as a positive feedback loop. The recent high temperatures have had a severe impact on Arctic sea ice formation this fall. Ice coverage was the lowest for any November since satellite records began in 1979, NOAA said. Sea ice is also getting thinner on average, as thicker, multiyear ice melts and is replaced by ice that lasts only a year. Temperatures this fall were so far off the charts that NOAA took the unusual step of extending the time frame for its annual \u201cArctic report card\u201d by a few days into early December. \u201cBecause we have seen such amazing trends in the last few months, we did an addendum,\u201d Dr. Mathis said. The report, which includes findings from   research projects involving more than 60 scientists, was released last week at a scientific meeting in San Francisco. At a news conference, Dr. Mathis said that in addition to the extreme warm periods, the overall year was the warmest on record. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a year in 2016 in the Arctic like we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said. While some of the warming is attributable to the effects of El Ni\u00f1o, which affected weather patterns worldwide last year, those effects are on top of what is already a clear warming trend. The NOAA review also showed that the Greenland ice sheet continued to lose mass from melting, as it has every year since 2002, when satellites began measurements. Melting began earlier this year than any previous year except 2012. At the news conference, Dr. Mathis noted that warming effects in the Arctic have had a cascading effect through the environment, \u201cincluding down into Arctic ecosystems. \u201d He said that communities that rely on hunting and fishing for their food security \u201cshould be very concerned. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder for them to harvest resources as the ice pulls back further and further away from the coast,\u201d he said. But Dr. Mathis added that changing conditions in the far north should concern everyone. \u201cWe need people to know and understand that the Arctic is going to have an impact on their lives no matter where they live. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628389.9340208}
