But there is one topic they are happy to gush about: their mother, Tina Knowles Lawson. In the January issue of Interview magazine, Solange is interviewed by Beyonc\u00e9 and waxes lyrical about how their mother \u201calways taught us to be in control of our voice and our bodies and our work. \u201d Last June, when accepting the fashion icon award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Beyonc\u00e9 dedicated it to her \u201cfabulous and beautiful\u201d mother. And in November, when Solange appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d a backstage video posted on Instagram, showing the singer carried by Mom and Big Sis, caused the internet to let out a collective \u201caww. \u201d Ms. Lawson, 63, now finds herself in a newfound role as an artistic bridge between two of 2016\u2019s most critically lauded albums: \u201cLemonade,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s fiery visual album that is up for nine nods at the Grammy Awards next month, and \u201cA Seat at the Table,\u201d Solange\u2019s spare and poetic RB record, which topped Pitchfork\u2019s   list last year. In October, her daughters made history when they became the first sisters to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart in the same year. The shadow of Ms. Lawson, a former Southern beautician who is a lifelong collector of black contemporary art, hovers over the artsy allusions in \u201cLemonade\u201d to intergenerational   motherhood, marital strife and their family\u2019s deep Creole roots. On the agitpop single \u201cFormation,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 shouts out her \u201cMomma Louisiana. \u201d The   Beyonc\u00e9 broke her silence to talk about her mother\u2019s creative influence (though on email, coordinated through a publicist). \u201cI think it was important to my mother to surround us with positive, powerful, strong images of African and   art so that we could reflect and see ourselves in them,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. \u201cMy mother has always been invested in making women feel beautiful,\u201d she added, \u201cwhether it was through someone sitting in her hair chair or making a prom dress for one of the girls at church. And her art collection always told the stories of women wanting to do the same. \u201d Ms. Lawson\u2019s appearance on \u201cA Seat at the Table\u201d is more explicit. In \u201cTina Taught Me,\u201d a cerebral     interlude, she sermonizes about black cultural pride, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve always been proud to be black. Never wanted to be nothing else. \u201d She also says it \u201csaddens\u201d her when people considers that to be \u201cantiwhite. \u201d Solange said: \u201cShe says things in that interlude that I had been trying to say for the last four years. But my mother has a very special way of communicating, a very special channel that she speaks through that has always felt bigger than her. \u201d \u201cIf my sister and my project feels like an \u2018awakening\u2019 to some,\u201d she added, \u201cI am constantly saying that we both grew up in a home with two words: Tina Knowles. \u201d The matriarch of pop music\u2019s reigning family resides (rather fittingly for a woman who once posed on the cover of Ebony wearing a gold crown) in a gated, castlelike home atop the winding Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. On a warm evening in late November, Ms. Lawson sat in her brightly colored living room, filled with postimpressionist and abstract works, mostly by African and   artists. Dressed casually in an   ensemble, \u201cMiss Tina\u201d  \u2014   as she likes to be called  \u2014   is all natural warmth and poise. She may have nurtured two supernatural superstar daughters, but she comes across as a sage retiree supremely at ease in her dewy, flawless skin. She offered a tour of works by Henry Ossawa Tanner and Elizabeth Catlett that hang   on her walls, saying that her children \u201cgrew up surrounded by art and feeling proud about who they are. \u201d She is also a goofball in person. Stepping out to her large outdoor balcony overlooking the twinkling skyline, she said her two favorite places to shop were Home Depot and Costco. \u201cI meet people every day that are like, \u2018You come here? \u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Of course, I do. \u2019\u201d Her irreverent side is familiar to her nearly one million followers on Instagram, a platform hardly known as welcoming to   women in their 60s. She cracks dorky mom jokes  \u2014   \u201cI told my assistant to have a really great day, and you know what she did? She went home!\u201d  \u2014   impersonates Tina Turner and generally clowns around with her friends and family. \u201cI want to show people the regularity of my life, and that not everything is so fancy,\u201d she said. Her fans can\u2019t get enough. \u201cIf you\u2019re not following Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mom on Instagram, here\u2019s what you\u2019re missing,\u201d declared an article from Harper\u2019s Bazaar in August. \u201cShe\u2019s basically everybody\u2019s auntie who is a sweetheart, but still keeps it real when necessary,\u201d said Crissle West, a   of \u201cThe Read,\u201d a popular podcast on   and pop culture. Ms. Lawson, nee Celestine Ann Beyinc\u00e9, grew up in the 1950s in \u201ca real small town\u201d in Galveston, Tex. The last of seven siblings, her father was a longshoreman and her mother was a seamstress. She picked up dressmaking at a young age, creating sparkly stage outfits for her   singing group while in high school. At 19, she moved to California to work as a makeup artist for Shiseido Cosmetics (she learned styling tricks from drag queens, she said) but returned to Texas a year later when her parents fell ill. With help from her   Matthew Knowles, a former Xerox executive, she opened a   hair salon in Houston called Headliners. The salon, which had more than a   run, helped the Knowles family afford an   lifestyle. It was also an impromptu stage for her young brood, while women under dryers acted as judges. When Destiny\u2019s Child, the girl group whose most famous lineup consisted of Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly Rowland (\u201cmy other daughter\u201d) and Michelle Williams, began to break out in the late 1990s, Ms. Lawson returned to dressmaking and whipped up matching cutaway Boy Scout uniforms,   camouflage hot pants and   fur sheaths for the group to wear onstage. As Beyonc\u00e9 put it in her Council of Fashion Designers of America speech last year, designers were reluctant to dress \u201cblack country curvy girls,\u201d so her mother stepped in. \u201cThey looked a little crazy sometimes,\u201d Ms. Lawson said, \u201cbut people always wondered what they were going to wear next. \u201d The \u201cBootylicious\u201d touch helped the group stand out. Destiny\u2019s Child went on to sell over 60 million records worldwide, and Destiny\u2019s mother became a fashion force. In 2004, she and Beyonc\u00e9 started the House of Der\u00e9on, a trendy,   clothing brand named after Ms. Lawson\u2019s mother. A juniors collection, bedding and a clothing line aimed at older women called Miss Tina soon followed. When the group disbanded in 2005, Ms. Lawson continued to create showstoppers for Beyonc\u00e9 as a solo artist, including the black brocade ball gown she wore for the 2005 Academy Awards. But in 2009, just when her professional life seemed to be at its peak, Ms. Lawson said her \u201cworld completely stopped. \u201d After 33 years of marriage, she filed for divorce from Mr. Knowles, who had been a talent manager for their daughters. Citing a \u201cconflict of personalities\u201d in court papers, the divorce was made final in 2011. \u201cI kind of lost myself,\u201d she said. \u201cAll these things that I love  \u2014   going to art shows, reading art books, going out dancing  \u2014   I had stopped. That\u2019s not really loving yourself, if you\u2019re not taking care of yourself in terms of your needs and what makes you happy. \u201d The split raised existential questions. \u201cWhat kind of life was I going to have now?\u201d Ms. Lawson said. \u201cI thought it was too late for me to try something new. You have all these doubts in your mind. \u201d In search of answers, she closed all her fashion businesses and, at 59, left Houston for Los Angeles for what she jokingly said was \u201ca new house, a new car, a new man and a new life. \u201d In 2013, she reconnected with an old friend, Richard Lawson, a TV actor known for his roles in \u201cDynasty\u201d and \u201cAll My Children. \u201d The couple tied the knot two years later. \u201cI just feel so liberated now, I really do,\u201d she said. Ms. Lawson now focuses much of her time on black female empowerment issues and philanthropy (she was honored at the Essence Festival in New Orleans last year) and she is writing an autobiography she says is a \u201c      book. \u201d She and her husband plan to open in March an acting workshop for underserved youth in Los Angeles, called the WACO Theater Center (short for \u201cWhere Art Can Occur\u201d). And after her   break from fashion, she designed the gold fringe outfit that Solange wore in her music video \u201cCranes in the Sky,\u201d as well as the white dress Solange wore for her performance at former President Barack Obama\u2019s farewell party at the White House on Jan. 6. \u201cThe day I had kids, I thought, \u2018I might screw everything else up, but not this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lawson said, flashing a knowing smile as she sat, regally postured, on her sofa. \u201cNow that they\u2019re grown women, it\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s my turn. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563472.8291464}
