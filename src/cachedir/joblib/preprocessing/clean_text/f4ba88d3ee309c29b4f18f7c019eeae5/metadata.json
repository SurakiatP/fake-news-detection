Credit: Jean Jullien \\nThere is no shortage of artwork depicting the influence technology has had on people and their relationships. The main takeaway from all collections is that while technology is great for numerous reasons, it does have its downsides. Tools, such as the internet, might connect groups of like-minded people, but overused, it may also result in individuals cutting themselves off from real life and, in effect, feeling lonely and isolated. \\nIt\u2019s this reality artist French illustrator Jean Jullien seeks to highlight with his witty illustrations. Best known for creating the \u201cPeace for Paris\u201d symbol which has become a worldwide sign of solidarity with France after the frightful attacks which took place earlier this year, the artist is also well-known for mocking peoples\u2019 obsession with technology . \\nOne only need review the thought-provoking illustrations below to get a sense of what Jullien hopes to convey. While technology is great, nothing can beat genuine, face-to-face interaction with others. After all, life isn\u2019t meant to be lived from behind a phone or a computer screen. #1 Weirdo On The Subway Credit: Jean Jullien\""}, "time": 1742563936.0361457}
