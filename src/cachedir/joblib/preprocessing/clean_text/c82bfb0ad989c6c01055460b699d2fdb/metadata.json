[\u201cWhen Young America\u2019s Foundation confirmed Ann Coulter would speak at   as part of YAF\u2019s nationwide campus lecture program on April 27, we assumed UC Berkeley would take all steps necessary to ensure the safety of students attending the educational event,\u201d the group declared in a blog post on Tuesday. \u201cIn the meantime we discovered that the University of California Police Department at Berkeley has an official \u2018 \u2019 policy for any situation that develops on campus as long as the situation doesn\u2019t involve the imminent loss of life, allowing the leftist thugs who have terrorized Berkeley\u2019s campus to do so without consequence. \u201d  \u201cAs of 4:00 p. m. today, Young America\u2019s Foundation will not be moving forward with an event at Berkeley on April 27 due to the lack of assurances for protections from foreseeable violence from unrestrained leftist agitators,\u201d they continued. \u201cBerkeley should be ashamed for creating this hostile atmosphere. \u201d YAF added that they are still pushing forward with their lawsuit against the college, and that the group \u201clooks forward to the day when First Amendment freedoms are enjoyed by conservative students. \u201d \u201cMs. Coulter may still choose to speak in some form on campus, but Young America\u2019s Foundation will not jeopardize the safety of its staff or students,\u201d they concluded. \u201cFor information on Ms. Coulter\u2019s plans, please contact her directly. \u201d Ron Robinson, the president of Young America\u2019s Foundation, also attacked the college in a quote, describing the campus as a \u201ccircus. \u201d \u201cAs a parent and a taxpayer, I want the next generation to learn in an educational environment, not a circus,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cI had the misfortune of being in a leftist riot as a student, and I wouldn\u2019t want to put my children or anyone else\u2019s children into that situation without assurances that law enforcement would protect them. \u201d The Berkeley College Republicans and YAF are currently in the process of suing UC Berkeley over the Ann Coulter event, which they claim has faced numerous unfair and biased restrictions. The groups, and their attorney Harmeet Dhillon, referenced previous events featuring conservative speakers at the college, which also faced similar scrutiny restrictions, including former Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos and conservative commentator David Horowitz. During a press conference about the lawsuit on Monday, Dhillon branded UC Berkeley\u2019s policies on \u201cacceptable speech\u201d as \u201cinfinitely malleable,\u201d before criticizing the Mayor of Berkeley, Jesse Arreguin, for appearing to sympathize with, be friendly to, and act softly on the   rioters who shut down Yiannopoulos\u2019 event earlier this year. \u201cIf the Mayor of Berkeley cannot maintain control of his city, the Governor should call the National Guard, because that\u2019s a serious public health issue,\u201d Dhillon proclaimed.
