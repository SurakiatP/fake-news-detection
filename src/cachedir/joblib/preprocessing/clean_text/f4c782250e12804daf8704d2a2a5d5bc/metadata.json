He explains:\\nHillary wants us all to disarm, right? Well, my answer to that is: Hillary, when you come after my guns, let the United States disarm first. We are the biggest gun dealer in the world; we sell weapons all over the world to kill people, and they\u2019re telling me to give up my 2nd amendment weapons, when my own government is the biggest weapons dealer throughout the world.\\n\\nThen Jesse demonstrates the insanity of gun control from his own experience living in Mexico. He says, \u201cI live in Mexico. Gun control is strictly followed there; you cannot have a gun. Yet they have 20,000 gun murders a year down there, or more. And yet, guns are banned.\u201d\\nVentura goes on to say that there are more gun murders in Mexico than there are in the US, even with such strict gun control measures. This completely ruins the leftist narrative.
