O\u2019Reilly said, \u201cI am sad that I\u2019m not on television anymore. I was very surprised how it all turned out. I can\u2019t say a lot because there is so much stuff going on right now. But I can tell you that I\u2019m very confident the truth will come out and when it does I don\u2019t know if you are going to be surprised, but I think you are going to be as shaken as I am. There is a lot of stuff involved here. Now I can\u2019t say any more because I just don\u2019t want to influence the flow of information. I don\u2019t want the media to take what I say and misconstrue it. You as a loyal O\u2019Reilly listener have a right to know down the lane what happened, and we are working in that direction. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561963.9885778}
