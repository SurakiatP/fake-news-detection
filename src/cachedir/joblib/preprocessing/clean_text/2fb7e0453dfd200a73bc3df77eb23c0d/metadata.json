[\u201cLook, there are any number of things that you could point to to say that it was a mistake that we made that probably has some merit to it, because it was such a perfect storm of a lot of different things,\u201d Finney told Jake Tapper, sitting on a panel of Democrats on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.  Finney said there was no \u201cmagic bullet\u201d that could have changed the direction of the doomed campaign. Even though she said the campaign was doomed, she also said that it was a close race. \u201cParticularly when you look at the fact that in those Rust Belt states   \u2026     that gap is about 70, 000 votes that we\u2019re talking about,\u201d she continued. \u201cA majority of those people agreed with [Clinton] on the economy, thought she\u2019d be better on the economy,\u2019 Finney said. \u2018And she\u2019s won 2. 8 million more in the popular vote. \u201d Finney suggested to Tapper that outreach could be better, like former DNC chairman Howard Dean\u2019s \u201c  strategy\u201d that helped Obama get elected. \u201cI think we need to learn some of the lessons coming out of this election, no question, in terms of how we talk to working families, whether they are black, white, brown and where those families are located, how we talk to them about the issues they care about,\u201d Finney said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that this is an example of, you know, there are one or two things that was just flip a switch and everything will be perfect,\u201d she said. In November, Finney blamed the election loss on everything but Clinton, saying she lost because of sexism, James Comey, and the media, among other reasons, the Washington Free Beacon reported.'"}, "time": 1742562050.867243}
