He practically beggs the people to give their votes for Hillary Clinton. For us, this is a HUGE reason NOT TO VOTE FOR HILLARY! She got $50 million from this man. I guess you know what am I talking about. Do not let their cooperation continue, because it is going to end up bad for America. Lets choose a true patriot and see where would our country go! I am sure it is going to be much better than crooked Hillary\u2019s road. \\nTurki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabia\u2019s ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday. \\nHe blasted Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. \\n\u2018For the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says, \u201cThese people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,\u201d\u2019 Turki said according to the Huffington Post. \\n\u2018It\u2019s up to you, it\u2019s not up to me,\u2019 Turki added. \u2018I just hope you, as American citizens, will make the right choice in November.\u2019 \\nThe gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors. \\nBill Clinton has praised the Qataris as \u201cintelligent, forward looking\u201d investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects. One of Hillary\u2019s top advisers, Cheryl Mills, served on the board of the New York \\nUniversity campus in Abu Dhabi. Bill Clinton is the friend and former classmate of Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who recently attended a lavish Clinton Foundation conference in Marrakech, hosted by the King of Morocco. The Bill Clinton presidential library in Little Rock was funded in part by a $10 million from the Saudi Royal family. \\nTurk, who went to Georgetown University in Washington, DC, isn\u2019t currently part of Saudia Arabia\u2019s government but serves as the chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, a cultural organization that conducts research in politics, sociology and heritage.'"}, "time": 1742563492.7503624}
