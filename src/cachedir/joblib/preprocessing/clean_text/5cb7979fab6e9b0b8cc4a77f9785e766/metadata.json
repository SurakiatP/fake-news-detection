There was plenty of skin and at least one crotch shot. These voluptuous ladies had sent these boudoir selfies to him, Eddie growled, his eyes sparkling. \\nEddie\u2019s a beefy dude, with a head like an Olmec statue. Though he wears a permanent scowl, it\u2019s a friendly scowl. \\nEddie was in Friendly Lounge with his housepainting boss, Tony, an Italian dude who used to live in the neighborhood. \\nAfter talking to Eddie, I checked out his FaceBook page. \u201cim a fun loving guy who just wants peace in my life,\u201d he introduces himself, and the first two photos feature Eddie with white women. In one, he\u2019s in some bar and wearing a white T-shirt, \u201cWHITE GIRLS LOVE ME.\u201d With his arms outstretched, Eddie\u2019s surrounded by eight white females and one bald white guy. The women appear to be in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, though one, wearing granny glasses, has sweated, cursed and imbibed her way through nearly six decades, it seems. You go, grandma! In the other photo, two beaming blondes drape themselves all over Eddie. \\nBelow these shots, there\u2019s a video of Oprah Winfrey begging her audience to vote for Hillary Clinton, and down the page, there\u2019s a computer animation of Donald Trump making his most grotesque faces while sitting on a toilet. \\nTalking to me, Eddie brought up the pains of being rejected by his dad all his life. The rates of American children being born out of wedlock have been rising, calamitously, for decades, and currently stand at around 40%. Among blacks, it\u2019s 72%. \\nI\u2019ve known Tony since high school. He lives in the suburbs too. I grew up in West Philly, right around the corner from the zoo, then I moved to the suburbs. I\u2019ve been working with Tony for two years. \\nI was in Boston for ten years. The only reason I came back here was because I had the cancer and everything. After they did the surgery, my family wanted me to come back, you know, be closer to home, in case it happens again. \\nI was doing work. The customers loved the work. Their relatives were from Boston, and they were like, \u201cDo you travel?\u201d I said, \u201cIf it\u2019s worth it, yeah.\u201d \\nSo they put me on a job up there, and my ex-girlfriend, I stayed at her house for a while, then I bought my own place. When I moved up there, I just got work, work, work, work. \\nI loved it up there! I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! \\nIt\u2019s funny because I\u2019m not like most black guys, black people, you know. I love the water, being out there on the water, fishing and all types of stuff, and there are so many bodies of water up there. That\u2019s where I get my peace of mind, you know what I mean? I sit there and don\u2019t have a care in the world. I didn\u2019t have my own boat. I was renting the stuff right there. \\nHere, it\u2019s not the same because you can\u2019t get in the water. I love fresh water. Fresh water is beautiful. I like deep sea fishing, salt water and all that, but freshwater is beautiful. \\nThis whole summer, I didn\u2019t hit the water at all. I didn\u2019t even swim this summer. Did you hear what I just said, Tony? This whole summer, I didn\u2019t even swim. Like, what the fuck! \\nThey have lakes up there, and they have park rangers and they\u2019ve got grills up there, where you can grill, volleyball nets, all that stuff. \\nIt\u2019s $4 a car-load, so you can have six people in a car. It only takes $4 to get in there. You can swim, fish, play volleyball, and you can do that almost any time. \\nEverybody kept telling me that it\u2019s crazy to move up there, like they\u2019re so prejudiced up there, but they\u2019re not. They were so nice. \\nThe first day I got up there, people were opening doors for me. They were like, \u201cHey, how are you doing?!\u201d It was totally different from here, you know, and I loved it, just loved it. \\nIt\u2019s not racial at all. There were so many mixed couples, so many Brazilians, Ecuadorians, all types. Puerto Ricans, Chinese, Asians, all, all, everything. \\nThey did have a bad rap, but it\u2019s just not correct. \\nThey do still have certain areas. They still have these little gangs. Like, one of my buddies wanted to take me to a club. We get there, and I have to park down the street. They had already gone inside the club, but I had to park. When I got close, walking, two dudes stopped me. There was a black guy and a Puerto Rican guy. They were like, \u201cYo, you got the wrong color on.\u201d \\nSo I opened my mouth, and I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d and I was laughing. \u201cYou don\u2019t know my lifestyle. You\u2019re coming at me like that?\u201d \\nAs soon as I opened my mouth, though, they were like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re not from around here. Where are you from?\u201d I said I\u2019m from Philly, so they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re cool, man.\u201d I laughed at them, basically. \\nThere are different levels with me. You get mad, you get angry and you get upset, you know what I\u2019m saying? I try not to get angry, at all. Angry takes me to a totally different place, which is not good, so I try not to do that. I try to stay at one focal point and, even though I\u2019m mad at you right now, I\u2019ll still say something stupid so that you laugh. \\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re just bothering me. I\u2019ll walk outside or something, then come back in, and I\u2019ll start fucking with you back, but in a fun way. Even though you were fucking with me in a bad way, I\u2019ll come back and fuck with you, in a good way. ORDER IT NOW \\nI always try to turn a negative into a positive. \\nYou\u2019re not going to defeat me by your words or whatever, you know, because I\u2019m very smart. In the 7th grade, I used to smoke weed and stuff like that, came to class all high, and I still got A\u2019s on my tests. \\nThey kept me after school, you know, because I was cheating, and I still got the same grade, so they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re so smart to be so dumb.\u201d \\nMy sociology teacher said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be getting high. You\u2019re too intelligent for that.\u201d It stuck with me all my life. \\nLike, me and him are FaceBook friends. I texted him, \u201cHey Mr. Coleman, blah, blah, blah. Yo, thank you for saying that to me when I took your class,\u201d and he was like, \u201cWell, Eddie, I don\u2019t remember what I said.\u201d I told him, \u201cYou said that I was so smart to be so dumb,\u201d and I always took that into my brain. \\nMy kids are mixed. I love white women. Ha, ha, ha! \\nWe all bleed the same damn color. People don\u2019t realize that racism is taught. If you take an Asian kid, a black kid and a white kid and put them in the sandbox, they\u2019re going to play, until somebody say they can\u2019t play with that child. \\nIt\u2019s the parents. The parents may come up to that kid, \u201cGet out of there! You can\u2019t play with them!\u201d You know what I mean? The kids will act how kids act. They don\u2019t know no better. They\u2019ll play! \\nMe, I have no problems at all. You respect me, I respect you. \\nLike I said, I have mixed kids, but growing up, I was shot at because I was black. I walked through the wrong neighborhood. Somebody tried to shoot me with a harpoon! I\u2019ve been through some shit. I can\u2019t help it if I\u2019m black. I can\u2019t help that. \\nThat\u2019s what he does, you know, scuba diving. He didn\u2019t hit me. I was lucky I got pushed out of the way. This was growing up in the suburbs, Lansdowne, Yeadon, Upper Darby. I got shot at, you know what I mean, because I walked on the sidewalk. \\nCops in Darby, they beat me up. It was a domestic call. My wife was white, OK? We had kids, mixed kids. The argument was next door, not my house, but they came at my house, threw me down the steps, beat me up, put me in a cop car, then turned around and told me, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go to the hospital, you better give me your address,\u201d so I gave them my address. \\nThey were like, \u201cYou don\u2019t live there. A white girl lives there.\u201d They were like, \u201cWhere you live at?\u201d I gave them the address again. They were like, \u201cYou don\u2019t live there! You go to the hospital,\u201d so guess what? I went to the hospital. They beat me the fuck up! \\nThey took me from my house. She was living there, with me! \\nI couldn\u2019t even fight back. My wife said, \u201cThat\u2019s my husband,\u201d but they made her go back in the house. This was \u201892. \\nI came home the next day. They ripped my shirt. I had a button shirt. They cut it in the back, with a razor, so I\u2019m walking in my shirt with a hole in it. They made me walk home without no shoes. \\nSo I went to my old neighborhood. I talked to my mom and all that, and we went to the Lansdowne police station, because we knew an officer there. They said there was nothing they could do about it, because there\u2019s a code of silence among the police officers, or so they said, so my sister took it to a different level. \\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of Mary Mason? WHAT? My sister took it to a radio station. They had a picture of me. They had a picture of my clothes. They had a picture of me all beat up and everything. \\nOver nothing! Over nothing! Literally. I was beaten up over nothing! \\nI ended up suing them but, again, I was young, so I settled out of court with them. I ended up getting, like, $45,000. If I kept it going, I would have gotten a whole lot more. \\nLike I said, again, then I was selling drugs. I had an arsenal. I had guns and stuff like that, you know. I was going to blow the police station the fuck up, you know what I mean, but the police station was right next to a school, so I couldn\u2019t do that. \\nNo, I didn\u2019t have a record then. I never got caught. \\nThey were arguing next door. It wasn\u2019t us! They went to the wrong house and fucked me up! \\nI\u2019ve got three friends that are police officers. I trust them, but I don\u2019t trust those other ones. As soon as I saw them, it\u2019s, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d whatever, but they threw me to the ground and worked me over! \\nFor two years, they harassed me. They banned me from that town. If they saw me driving, they\u2019d pull me over. They were like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got two minutes to get out of this town!\u201d \\nI had to move back to my mom for a little while. My wife and kids, too. \\nI never got bitter over that. I get sick of reading stuff now in the news. I think about my children\u2019s security. It pisses me off, you know. \\nLike I said, again, I already lived that life. Innocent people getting beaten up by the cops, getting killed, that could have been me, I could have gotten killed. That night. \\nWhat I was doing was, I was avoiding that act, you know, which was kind of hard to do, because certain roads led that way, so I had to take back streets just to keep away. Again, I was still young too. \\nI was going to blow the hell out of that police station, you know what I mean? I had the artillery to do it, but, again, glory to God and all that. God had my back! Otherwise, that police station and whoever was in it was gone! ORDER IT NOW \\nThere\u2019s a kid that I went to school with, they killed him in a cell. Now, when they put you in that cell, they take your shoe strings, they take your belt and they take your shirt from you, so how are you going to hang yourself? He\u2019s 6-4. How do you hang yourself when you\u2019re 6-4 and you\u2019re in a 6-foot cell? You can\u2019t! \\nHe was a good kid, but he was a bad kid, you know what I mean? I forget how he got locked up. He got locked up for something. They killed him the same night. They locked him up, then they killed him. You can look it up. It\u2019s on the internet still. \\nMy wife stayed with me. Five years later, we split up, but it wasn\u2019t over that. I had three children with her, my oldest three. \\nShe got mad because I moved on. I had another woman. I was just having another kid. I had a reason to dump her, you know what I mean? If you\u2019re in a relationship, and you\u2019re not growing. You\u2019re supposed to grow together. She cheated on me. I\u2019m sure she did. She got caught twice, so when she started doing it, I started doing it. \\nShe did it first, she did it first, she started it. \\nAll I did was work. I worked, then came home, I swear to God! I was bringing home $1,300 cash a week. I was taking out vent systems, heaters, boilers and all that. I was bringing all this money home. It\u2019s heavy work, back-breaking stuff. All you wanted to do was go home to your shower and that\u2019s it. Eat, then sleep. \\nI was mad because she was collecting welfare. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhy are you collecting welfare?\u201d We\u2019ve got plenty of money. We had a good life. It\u2019s because of her girlfriends. It was like, \u201cYou can get this, you get that.\u201d Now, I had no insurance and stuff. I told her, \u201cYou can get the medical, and you can get the food stamps, but don\u2019t get the cash,\u201d but she went out and got it all. She got all the benefits, so I ended up in the system. \\nI told the judge, \u201cHow are you locking me up, when my kids live with me? Like, what are you talking about? This is my house. My kids live with me and everything.\u201d Well, it was because of her, she was getting welfare, but I didn\u2019t know. \\nI was getting locked up for a month here, a month there, you know. When they locked you up in the state of Pennsylvania, they suspended your license, so how could you get to work? If you had a driving job, you couldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s fucked up! \\nI told the judge, again, here you go, \u201cMy kids live with me. I don\u2019t owe her nothing. Why am I here? If you look at the record, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m talking about here. I\u2019m confused. You guys locked me up, like, six fuckin\u2019 times,\u201d so he said, \u201cMa\u2019am, why is he here?\u201d \\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m trying to get more money, blah, blah, blah blah,\u201d so he looked and found out that she had a warrant out, so he said to me, \u201cMr. Calvin, you want me to lock her up? What she\u2019s doing is welfare fraud.\u201d \\nI said, \u201cYour honor, no.\u201d I said no. \u201cWe\u2019re not together no more. I didn\u2019t suffer from you guys. I was in the system. I was in jail six times, but I\u2019m done now.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s my kids\u2019 mother. Don\u2019t lock her up.\u201d \\nHe went to her, and he said, \u201cMa\u2019am, this is a hell of a nice guy. Why did you do this to him?\u201d She had no answer. \\nShe was acting real stupid. I looked at her and I said, \u201cI told you you wasn\u2019t going to get no money.\u201d That\u2019s what I said to her. \u201cI told you you weren\u2019t going to get no money. The judge could have locked you up, no matter what I said. You heard what he said. It was welfare fraud. You\u2019re stupid for even bringing me in here.\u201d \\nI had three kids with her, my oldest three. \\nI have a kid that\u2019s getting ready to turn four, up in Boston. All of my other kids are here. I\u2019ve got 24, 21, 20, 16, 15 and one that\u2019s getting ready to turn four. I grew up without a father, so I was going to make sure I\u2019m not going to be like my father, you know what I mean? \\nMy three oldest, I put money into their accounts, in their names. They each have $50,000 in their bank account, right now. They\u2019ve got more money than I do. Now, my younger ones, my 16 and 15-year-old, they\u2019ve got about $10,000. The baby don\u2019t have shit, you know what I mean, but she\u2019s going to get hers. \\nI was doing the smart thing with the money. Like I said, I grew up without a father, so I\u2019m going to provide for my kids, no matter what. I\u2019ll suffer later, but as long as my kids are OK, then I\u2019m happy. \\nWhen I did get to know my father, I met him in church. I was 16 years old when I got to meet my father. I went to church with my mom. \\nI was 16. Again, I was selling drugs, but I was also working at McDonald\u2019s and going to school. \\nHe comes into church, sits behind us and goes like this to my mom. Taps on her shoulder, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d She almost cursed in church. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t know your own son!\u201d I turned around and almost flipped, but then I realized I was in church. I was like, \u201cYou made me and you don\u2019t know who I am?!\u201d \\nWhen she got pregnant by him, she was with him for, like, five years. She said, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d and the next day, he was gone. My father did this to five other women, the same exact thing, because I have five brothers. He did the same thing to each one of the women. \\nMy father, I almost killed him, in church. I was so angry. Yeaah. Yeaah. I was like, \u201cHow can you not know who I am? Where was you at?\u201d Like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me? What did I do to you? I didn\u2019t do anything to you. You made me,\u201d but there was nothing, not a fuckin\u2019 word, not a fuckin\u2019 word. ORDER IT NOW \\nI never called him dad. I never called him pop. There was nothing until I turned 18. When we graduated high school, I paid for his parking to come see me graduate. That\u2019s fucked up. \\nNow, my grandfather and grandma loved the shit out of me. I knew them. I knew them since I was three! \\nMy grandparents, they loved me. They knew who I was. My grandpop and grandmom used to always brag about me when I walked down the street, when I walked by the house, everything like that. They\u2019d say, \u201cThere goes my grandson.\u201d They would tell people,\u201d There\u2019s my grandson.\u201d \\nMy father came to my graduation because I begged him to come. Face to face, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m your son. Aren\u2019t you proud of me for graduating, at least?\u201d He was like, \u201cWell, she has money.\u201d \\nI paid for his parking. I paid for his ticket. We got, like, three graduation tickets, and you had to pay for two more. I paid for it. I paid for him. It was $10 or something. He didn\u2019t want to pay $10 to see his son graduate. \\nThat\u2019s why I made a promise to myself. I said that when I have kids, no matter what happens between me and the girl, my kids are going to know who I am, and that I was there, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. \\nTony gets mad that a lot of his crew don\u2019t have cars and stuff, but when my son, my first born, made me a grandpa, I gave him my truck. \\nI know what it\u2019s like to be on a bus with kids, grocery shopping and all that, with the kid wrapped around you, and you carrying bags and getting on a bus. I know what it\u2019s like, so I gave him my truck. \\nI told Tony, \u201cI ain\u2019t got no vehicle, man. I gave it to my son. I ain\u2019t got no car!\u201d But it made me feel good, because I would never be like my father. Never! \\nWhen I hear people, because I hear people all the time, like how they hate their mom, how they hate their dad, and I\u2019m like, I can see how you hate your dad, and you must have a reason, but at least you\u2019re living together. I didn\u2019t have that. All I had was my mom. You\u2019ve got a mom and a dad, so you should be happy, you\u2019re lucky, because I didn\u2019t have that. \\nLinh Dinh is the author of two books of stories, five of poems, and a novel, Love Like Hate .
