But it\u2019s also a fact that if your ammunition has been stored in poor conditions, it not only won\u2019t last as long as it should, but it also could potentially become dangerous to shoot if it is corroded or deteriorated. \\nThis is why you need to store your ammo the same way you store your firearms. After all, you store your firearms in a secure and environmentally safe location, so why wouldn\u2019t you do the same with your ammunition in which you may have invested even more money? \\nAll ammo has a definitive shelf life. Eventually, it will go bad. But if you use proper storage techniques, you can make your ammo last on the shelf for year and years. Ammunition that has been taken care of properly and stored in the right conditions should last for 12 to 15 years before you begin to notice signs of discoloration or corrosion. \\nLet\u2019s learn about some basic and yet effective storage tips you can use to ensure that you get the most out of your ammo: \\n1. Store in metal ammo cans. \\nRegardless of whether you like to keep your ammo in the boxes it came in or store it loosely, you will need to place it in metal ammo cans for storage purposes. Green metal ammo cans can be found at virtually any sporting goods store, in the $10-$20 dollar range, depending on the size of the can. \\nThe reason why you should store your ammo in these metal cans is not just for ease of organization, but also because the cans are airtight and waterproof. They are sealed around the edges, which means you could even dunk them underwater and they would keep the water out. \\n2. Store in a dry place. \\nHumidity and moisture in general will be the biggest contributor to corrosion and discoloration. Since corroded ammo is not safe to fire, it\u2019s imperative that you select a storage location where the moisture is kept to a minimum. \\nYes, storing your ammunition in the green metal ammo cans will do a lot to resist moisture, but it never hurts to be extra careful. Keep in mind that ammunition is not cheap, so you want to take extra good care of your investment. Store it in a dry place with low moisture levels, and you can sleep knowing your ammo should remain in good condition several years down the road. Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742563184.3362658}
