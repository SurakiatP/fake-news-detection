October 28, 2016 \\nA firefighter from Florida appeared on TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles in April 2016, in which he shared his years-old vision of Donald Trump becoming president. \\nMany people are questioning how Donald Trump fits into God\\'s plan for the nation. \\nSome say he\\'s a modern-day Cyrus; others compare him to Nebuchadnezzar. \\nNow, firefighter Mark Taylor tells TruNews\\' Rick Wiles that Trump was ordained for such a time as this. \\n\"The Spirit of God says, \\'I have chosen this man, Donald Trump, for such a time as this. For as Benjamin Netanyahu is to Israel, so shall this man be to the United States of America! For I will use this man to bring honor, respect and restoration to America. America will be respected once again as the most powerful and prosperous nation on Earth, (other than Israel). The dollar will be the strongest it has ever been in the history of the United States, and will once again be the currency by which all others are judged,\\'\" Taylor says the Lord told him five years ago. \\nSo what does this mean for today? Listen to the TRUNEWS program from April 18, 2016 and ask the Lord for discernment.  '"}, "time": 1742562790.4922936}
