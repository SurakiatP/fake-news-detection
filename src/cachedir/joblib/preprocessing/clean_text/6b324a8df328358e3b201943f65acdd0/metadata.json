This latest tranche includes 888 communications.\\nMuch of the latest emails\u2019 content repeats from previous WikiLeaks releases, because entire email threads are not always released at once.\\n\u2018Needy Latinos\u2019 considered for VP \\nIn one leaked email, dated August 21, 2015 with the subject line \u2018Needy Latinos and 1 easy call,\u2019 Podesta writes to Clinton, \u201cA few calls you might consider making,\u201d apparently in relation to potential vice president choices.\\nPodesta then names Federico Pena, Bill Richardson and South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges. The first two are presumably the \u201cneedy Latinos.\u201d\\nPena, former secretary of the US Department of Transportation under President Bill Clinton, endorsed Barack Obama over Clinton for the 2008 election and served as his campaign chair. He is covered extensively in the email.\\nPodesta goes on to say that Pena\u2019s \u201cCabinet stints ripped up his family,\u201d and that Pena \u201cgave everything to the cause and no time to his family, he went through a messy divorce in the late 90\u2019s and was left really down and felt like no-one reached out to him then so he felt pretty cut off from Clinton World.\u201d\\nPodesta, passing along all of this information after speaking with former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, gives Clinton four steps in completing a call with Pena, writing: \u201c1) you really enjoyed seeing Cindy at the Chambers event and appreciate her support. 2) ask him how he\u2019s been doing 3) ask about his views on the race and what she should be doing in Colorado 4) ask that he consider publicly supporting you.\u201d\\nAn email reply from Hillary Clinton herself reads: \u201cAgree about calls. Just a few additional points: several Latinos have asked that I consider Pena for VP.\u201d\\nOn Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico and US ambassador to the UN under President Clinton, Podesta writes that a recent phone call between Bill Clinton and Richardson went well, \u201cnot withstanding the fact that [Richardson] can be a dick.\u201d\\n\u201cHe had a good conversation with the President and has been good in his interviews since,\u201d Podesta says of Richardson, telling Hillary that a call to Richardson ahead of his upcoming appearance on NBC\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 might seal an endorsement.\\nDonna Brazile \\nThe extent of the cozy relationship between the Clinton campaign and CNN was revealed in an email from the former head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, which contained, almost verbatim, the wording of a question Clinton was to be asked at a town hall in Ohio.\\nSent the day before the televised event, which aired on March 13, 2016, Clinton is given the wording for a question she will be asked regarding discrimination amongst trade unions.\\nAlso included is the wording of a question her opponent Bernie Sanders is to be asked on income inequality.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742628605.4649417}
