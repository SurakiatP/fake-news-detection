He never gave his 1990 album \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\u201d a proper tour, instead performing a set of cover songs in 1991 before he took a lengthy break from the road. He returned to the stage in 2006, and reached the United States two years later with a show that demonstrated he had no intention of becoming an oldies act, as The New York Times\u2019s chief pop, critic Jon Pareles, wrote at the time. Here are five performances from 1985 to 2008 that showcase Mr. Michael\u2019s range as a live artist: [ Why George Michael mattered | Read the obituary ] \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,\u201d George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley with Elton John at Live Aid, 1985 In 1991, a live version of George Michael and Elton John\u2019s duet, written by Mr. John and Bernie Taupin, reached No. 1 in the United States and Britain. But the duo had performed it live for the first time six years earlier during Mr. John\u2019s set at Live Aid, where he introduced Mr. Michael as someone he admired \u201cvery much for his musical talent, more than anything else. \u201d In his trademark sunglasses and leather jacket, Mr. Michael commanded the stage  \u2014   so much so that at the 4:30 mark, Mr. John starts grinning and pointing at Mr. Michael with approval and pride. \u201cSomebody to Love,\u201d George Michael and Queen at Wembley Stadium, 1992 An array of artists appeared alongside Queen to honor the band\u2019s frontman at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness, including Axl Rose, Liza Minnelli, David Bowie and Seal. But Mr. Michael\u2019s performances at the event were particularly inspired  \u2014   in 1993, he released an EP of live tracks from the show, including \u201cSomebody to Love,\u201d the 1976 Queen song with a swooping vocal line that beautifully displayed Mr. Michael\u2019s silky range. \u201cFreedom! \u201990\u201d at the MTV Europe Awards, 1994 George Michael performed twice at the MTV Europe Awards in 1994. He opened the show with this exuberant rendition of \u201cFreedom! \u201990,\u201d and then returned to debut the far more somber \u201cJesus to a Child,\u201d a tribute to his partner, Anselmo Feleppa, who had died of an   illness. The first performance put the spotlight on Mr. Michael\u2019s energetic showmanship. The arrangement accentuated the song\u2019s soulfulness, with a chorus of backup singers approximating an ecstatic choir, especially as Mr. Michael moved into the song\u2019s bridge around the   mark. \u201cEverything She Wants\u201d on \u201cMTV Unplugged,\u201d 1996 Mr. Michael was always as comfortable stripping his songs down to their bare elements as he was gliding across a stage shaking his hips (an acoustic guitar was perhaps the most memorable weapon in his arsenal, thanks to \u201cFaith\u201d). In his \u201cMTV Unplugged\u201d performance, he gave this Wham! hit a remake with eight powerhouse backup singers. \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d at Earl\u2019s Court, 2008 Mr. Michael returned to live performance in 2006 for his first extensive run of live shows in 15 years. The tour, which stretched into 2008, was billed as a sort of 25th anniversary concert, and it featured songs from across his career, including \u201cToo Funky,\u201d \u201cFather Figure\u201d and \u201cKissing a Fool. \u201d Each leg of the tour, however, included \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d one of Mr. Michael\u2019s biggest hits. The only crime here is that the crowd shouts the majority of the     bridge: At the 2:36 mark, Mr. Michael generously lets the audience take the lead with \u201cyou know you want to!\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564275.8309498}
