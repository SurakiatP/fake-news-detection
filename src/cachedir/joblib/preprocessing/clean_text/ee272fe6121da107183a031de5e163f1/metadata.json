They\u2019ve done wonders for our brand on the international stage.\u201d \\nMr Williams added, \u201cStatistically, when someone in the world asks \u2018what kind of arsehole would say that?\u2019, there\u2019s now a 68% probability that the arsehole they\u2019re referring to will be British. \\n\u201cWe can\u2019t rest on our laurels, though; it\u2019s a very competitive market,\u201d warned Williams. \\n\u201cTrump. Putin. Bieber. The world\u2019s chock full of arseholes at the moment.\u201d \\nTo help keep the UK on top, Mr Williams announced that Nigel Farage will become the UK\u2019s \u2018Arsehole Tsar\u2019. \\nThis will involve Mr Farage travelling around the globe on a lavishly refurbished Royal Yacht Britannia, visiting dozens of different countries and reminding them why Britain is an international laughing stock. \\nLooking to the future, Mr Williams was optimistic. \\n\u201cTwitter, Facebook and The Mail Online\u2019s comments section are busy producing the UK\u2019s next generation of opinionated morons. \\n\u201cWith a little luck, we\u2019ll continue to create the kind of exceptional arsehole that can confidently retweet a racist meme or \u2018like\u2019 a Britain First article.\u201d Have you checked the standings in the Arsehole Premier League ?
