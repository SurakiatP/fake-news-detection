(See \u201c NYT refuses Muhammad cartoon but publishes offensive painting of Virgin Mary in elephant dung \u201c) \\nThe celebrated Spanish artist, Pablo Picasso, was sneakier in his use of feces. \\nRichard Johnson reports for Page Six , Oct. 30, 2016, that a new book by Thomas Girst and Magnus Resch, 100 Secrets of the Art World , reveals that Picasso painted with feces. \\nDivulging \u201ca family secret,\u201d Diana Widmaier Picasso told the book\u2019s authors that her grandfather, Pablo Picasso, had used the feces of his then-3-year-old daughter Maya (Diana\u2019s mother) to paint an apple in a 1938 still life. \\nDiana said, \u201cAccording to him, excrement from an infant breast-fed by its mother had a unique texture and ocher color. The revulsion that this material might provoke is instead transformed into amazement as we grasp the full imagination of the artist.\u201d Blah, blah, blah. \\nPablo Picasso was a communist and an atheist. \\nFrom Wikipedia : \\nIn 1944 Picasso joined the French Communist Party, attended an international peace conference in Poland, and in 1950 received the Stalin Peace Prize from the Soviet government. But party criticism of a portrait of Stalin as insufficiently realistic cooled Picasso\u2019s interest in Soviet politics, though he remained a loyal member of the Communist Party until his death. In a 1945 interview with Jerome Seckler, Picasso stated: \u201cI am a Communist and my painting is Communist painting\u2026.\u201d \\nIn 1940, the French government refused Picasso\u2019s application for French citizenship on the grounds of his \u201cextremist ideas evolving towards communism\u201d. This information was not revealed until 2003. \\nSee also:'"}, "time": 1742563361.9694767}
