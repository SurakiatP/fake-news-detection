[\u201cWe are seeing an increase in the fees charged by human smugglers along the U. S. southwest border,\u201d Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John F. Kelly said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. \u201cSince Nov. 2016, \u2018coyotes\u2019 have hiked their fees in some areas by roughly 130 percent \u2014  from $3, 500 to $8, 000 in certain mountainous regions. \u201d  Kelly attributed the increased fees charged to newly implemented changes in DHS policy regarding the detention of apprehended aliens. \u201cAs directed in my memoranda implementing the President\u2019s executive orders, we remain committed to carrying out fair, impartial and humane enforcement of the nation\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d Kelly wrote. Coyotes have become dependent on human smuggling fees, often earning as much from smuggling people as drug runs. Breitbart Texas reported in the days before the November 2016 Election,   smugglers were using the contest as a \u201cmarketing tool\u201d to get people to travel in advance. \u201cThe cartel uses what happens in the U. S. as a marketing tool in Central America,\u201d McAllen Mayor Jim Darling said during an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas. \u201cThe need is there (in Central America) but what happens in Washington and the way the news media presents it, they (cartels) say you better get up here. So that causes the surges. We\u201dll see what happens after the election to see if it slows down. \u201d After the election, it did not slow down. The months of November, December, and January, all saw increases in apprehensions compared to the same months in the prior year. Following the release of December\u2019s numbers showing a large increase in apprehensions, particularly in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Marlene Castro said, \u201cWe\u2019re not a deterrent because they\u2019re looking for us, so we can be standing there and [the smuggler will] still send them across,\u201d during an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s William La Jeunesse. \u201cIt\u2019s been a group, and then maybe five minutes later another group, and then half an hour later you\u2019ll see another one. \u201d With the swearing in of President Trump in January, the numbers finally began to subside. While still higher than January 2016, the numbers were down from December. The first full month of the Trump Administration brought a dramatic drop in migrant apprehensions between ports of entry along the southwest border. Apprehensions not only dropped from January to February they dropped to the lowest level of any month in the past five years. \u201cThe drop in apprehensions shows a marked change in trends,\u201d Secretary Kelly said. \u201cSince the Administration\u2019s implementation of Executive Orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years. \u201d \u201cSince President Trump took office on January 20, we have seen a dramatic drop in numbers,\u201d Kelly stated. \u201cWe will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as numbers of illegal crossings typically increase between March and May. However, the early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact. \u201d \u201cThe decrease is also encouraging news because it means many fewer people are putting themselves and their families at risk of exploitation, assault, and injury by human traffickers and the physical dangers of the treacherous journey north,\u201d the DHS secretary concluded.
