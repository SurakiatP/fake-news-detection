[For followers of Jesus, this week marks the culmination of a lifetime of sinless obedience to God, and the final five days of a teaching ministry that even the billions who do not claim the name of Christ must readily acknowledge changed the world forever.  But what does the Bible say happened as these final events of Jesus\u2019 life began to unfold? The Old Testament Zechariah had prophesied that Israel\u2019s great king, the messiah, would come mounted \u201con a colt, the foal of a donkey. \u201d From the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament: And when he [Jesus] had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, saying, \u201cGo into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, \u2018Why are you untying it?\u2019 you shall say this: \u2018The Lord has need of it. \u2019\u201d So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them. And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, \u201cWhy are you untying the colt?\u201d And they said, \u201cThe Lord has need of it. \u201d And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road. As he was drawing near \u2014  already on the way down the Mount of Olives \u2014  the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying \u201cBlessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!\u201d And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, \u201cTeacher, rebuke your disciples. \u201d He answered, \u201cI tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out. \u201d  \u2014  Luke 19:28 \u2014  40 (ESV).
