Attacking Hillary Clinton over what he criticized as her overly interventionist instincts, Mr. Johnson pointed to the hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians killed by forces loyal to President Bashar   as well as civilian deaths caused by the   coalition, and said Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, bore at least partial responsibility. But when pressed four times on whether he saw a moral equivalence between deaths caused by the United States, directly or indirectly, and mass killings of civilians by Mr. Assad and his allies, Mr. Johnson made clear that he did. \u201cWell no, of course not  \u2014   we\u2019re so much better than all that,\u201d Mr. Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said sarcastically. \u201cWe\u2019re so much better when in Afghanistan, we bomb the hospital and 60 people are killed in the hospital. \u201d The remarks by Mr. Johnson came in an interview with The New York Times after a string of damaging stumbles when he has fielded questions about foreign affairs. After failing to recognize the   Syrian city of Aleppo during a television interview Sept. 8, Mr. Johnson had another difficult moment on Sept. 28, when he vainly tried to name a foreign leader whom he admired. In the Times interview on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson conspicuously sought to avoid another misstep. Asked if he knew the name of North Korea\u2019s leader, Mr. Johnson replied, \u201cI do. \u201d \u201cYou want me to name\u201d the person, he said, then paused, before adding dryly, \u201cReally. \u201d But he declined to supply the name. Mr. Johnson complained that Mrs. Clinton was being judged on her base of knowledge rather than her interventionist instincts. \u201cBecause Hillary Clinton can dot the i\u2019s and cross the t\u2019s on geographic leaders, of the names of foreign leaders,\u201d he said, \u201cthe underlying fact that hundreds of thousands of people have died in Syria goes by the wayside. \u201d He charged that Mrs. Clinton \u201cbears responsibility for what\u2019s happened, shared responsibility for what\u2019s happened in Syria. I would not have put us in that situation from the  . \u201d More than 400, 000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war, according to the United Nations. But Mr. Johnson complained that presidential candidates were expected to talk tough about dealing with dictators like Mr. Assad or risk losing support. \u201cThis is what happens in this country right now  \u2014   unless you\u2019re willing to say that you\u2019re going to get tough on this stuff, on these atrocities  \u2014   and these atrocities are horrible  \u2014   but unless you as a politician are willing to do something about these atrocities then we\u2019re not going to elect you,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Johnson speculated about the deals or promises that the Obama administration may have dangled before   forces, but then said at other points that he was at a disadvantage discussing world events because he has not received the classified briefings that the Democratic and Republican nominees for president have been given. Mr. Johnson also declined to say whether his running mate, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, had warned him of his intention to change course and spend the remainder of the presidential campaign attacking Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, as unqualified. Mr. Weld revealed those plans in an interview with The Boston Globe on Tuesday. \u201cThat may be his primary mission,\u201d Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Weld\u2019s plans. \u201cWe\u2019re not scripted at all. And so I guess my role will be Hillary and his role will be Donald Trump. \u201d But he insisted that Mr. Weld would not drop out at any point and endorse Mrs. Clinton. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mr. Johnson said when asked if Mr. Weld would fight on until Nov. 8. Mr. Johnson said that the idea of hunkering down and trying to make an aggressive play to win his home state of New Mexico, where polls show him in contention, had crossed his mind. But he conceded that his chances of winning outright were all but gone. \u201cRight now it\u2019s a Hail Mary, not being in the presidential debates,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561706.5885081}
