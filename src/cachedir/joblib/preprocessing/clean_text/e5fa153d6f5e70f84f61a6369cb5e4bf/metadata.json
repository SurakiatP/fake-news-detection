In fact, they\u2019ve represented people like Mark Cuban and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg. \\nHe\u2019s a good guy, too! \\nI know this because Boutrous has offered to represent anyone who is sued by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for exercising their right to free speech. \\nAnd he won\u2019t charge you for it. I repeat: I will represent pro bono anyone #Trump sues for exercising their free speech rights. Many other lawyers have offered to join me. https://t.co/LJf6TtmGZU \\n\u2014 Ted Boutrous (@BoutrousTed) October 22, 2016 \\nBoutrous is not alone, either. \\nLaurence Tribe is a well known constitutional law professor at Harvard University. He\u2019s promising the same free defense of anyone sued by Trump just for telling the truth. You can count on me to help with this pro bono, @BoutrousTed https://t.co/hwC2K0TLCB \\n\u2014 Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) October 23, 2016 \\nPretty cool! This restores my faith in Americans, for sure. \\nIt seems that there are a lot of people who are disgusted with Trump\u2019s constant threats to sue. USA Today reports that Trump has been involved in over 3, 500 lawsuits. He routinely uses the law to badger and intimidate his opponents. \\nTrump has famously refused to pay contractors who have worked on his multi-million dollar projects. When those small companies ask for payment, Trump glibly tells them to take him to court, knowing that the costs would stop them from going forward. They end up settling for cents on the dollar, every time. \\nHe has also threatened to sue various media outlets when they report information that he doesn\u2019t like.

The response to his offer has been excellent. Boutrous said : \u201cEver since I sent that tweet, the outpouring from other lawyers and people who want to help is just incredible. It was so offensive to fundamental First Amendment values and democratic principles to have someone threaten to sue people who are criticizing him. The First Amendment is designed to protect exactly that kind of speech.\u201d \\nThis is the part that Donald Trump seems incapable of understanding. It is a violation of the U.S. Constitution to deny people the right to speak freely, even if they criticize you. \\nHaving written my fair share of articles that criticize the big orange buffoon, I\u2019m very happy to know these guys have my back! \\nFeatured image by Gage Skidmore via Flickr .
