Trump\u2019s choice for White House budget director failed to pay more than $15, 000 in payroll taxes for a household employee, he admitted in a statement to the Senate Budget Committee, the sort of tax compliance issue that has derailed cabinet nominees in the past. In a questionnaire provided to the committee, Representative Mick Mulvaney, a conservative from South Carolina and vocal proponent of fiscal restraint noted, \u201cI have come to learn during the confirmation review process that I failed to pay FICA and federal and state unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years  . \u201d Mr. Mulvaney said he had subsequently paid more than $15, 000 in taxes and awaits the state tax bill, as well as penalties and interests. His confirmation hearing before the committee is scheduled for Jan. 24. The employee was a babysitter hired when Mr. Mulvaney and his wife had triplets in 2000. Attempts to reach Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s office for comment were not successful. A spokesman for the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, said he would have no immediate comment. Mr. Mulvaney will almost certainly be asked about the issue at his hearing, and Republicans on the committee are most likely aware of its existence. The situation is similar to that of former Senator Tom Daschle, who in 2009 was forced to withdraw his nomination as President Obama\u2019s choice to lead the Health and Human Services Department. During Mr. Daschle\u2019s confirmation process, it was revealed that he had paid roughly $140, 000 in back taxes related to a car and driver provided to him by a former employer, and to some consulting income. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who is now the   Republican in the Senate, said at the time that he would not support Mr. Daschle\u2019s nomination, calling his tax issue \u201ca little too much to swallow. \u201d Mr. Daschle\u2019s withdrawal came two weeks after Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Obama\u2019s first Treasury secretary, was nearly knocked out with his announcement that he had failed to pay $25, 000 in payroll taxes while working at the International Monetary Fund. In a statement, John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said: \u201cNobody is more qualified and more prepared to rein in Washington spending and fight for taxpayers than Mick Mulvaney. Congressman Mulvaney raised the issue surrounding the care of his premature triplets immediately upon being tapped for this position, and has taken the appropriate   measures. The administration fully stands behind Representative Mulvaney. \u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement: \u201cSenator Tom Daschle did the same thing and Republicans insisted that that disqualified him from becoming H. H. S. secretary. We say to our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander. If Tom Daschle couldn\u2019t become a cabinet member for not paying taxes for a household employee, the same standard ought to apply to Mick Mulvaney. \u201d Two potential attorneys general under President Bill Clinton  \u2014   Zoe E. Baird and Kimba Wood  \u2014   lost their chances to become the first women to hold that office their nominations were pulled after revelations of   nanny issues. The revelation of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s tax issue will test the Senate, which has greeted tax issues of past nominees with bipartisan denunciations. The process of confirming Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees has quickly been somewhat stymied because of a slow vetting process. Several hearings were delayed because the nominees had not been cleared by the agency charged with unraveling potential conflicts of interest. Nominees undergo a rigorous screening by the F. B. I. and must clear the Office of Government Ethics to unravel any potential conflicts of interest that could present future legal problems. What is more, many committees have their own screening process.'"}, "time": 1742562368.5563512}
