Niloofar Rahmani, the first female   pilot in the Afghan Air Force. On Thursday, Captain Rahmani revealed that she had applied for asylum this summer, saying she felt unsafe in Afghanistan, where she and her family have received death threats. For the last 15 months, she has been training at air bases in Arkansas, Florida and Texas. Captain Rahmani said that her Afghan male colleagues in the air force treated her with contempt and that she felt at risk. \u201cThings are not changing\u201d for the better in Afghanistan, Captain Rahmani said in an interview on Friday. \u201cThings are getting worse and worse. \u201d Gen. Mohammad Radmanish, a Defense Ministry spokesman, disputed her claims of being in danger. \u201cI am sure she lied by saying she was threatened, just to win the asylum case,\u201d General Radmanish said on Sunday. \u201cIt is baseless that she claimed her life was at risk while serving in the Afghan Air Force. \u201d \u201cSince Captain Rahmani\u2019s claim is new, we expect her to change her mind and return to her own country and continue serving as a pilot,\u201d the general said. \u201cWe request from our American friends and government to reject her asylum case and send her back, because knowing the truth, Captain Rahmani\u2019s life isn\u2019t at risk at all. \u201d The American government has celebrated Captain Rahmani as an example of its success in advancing women\u2019s rights in Afghanistan. In 2015 the State Department honored her with its annual Women of Courage award, and Michelle Obama praised her courage. In Afghanistan, few supported her decision, and there were worries that her asylum request would affect the process of training Afghan pilots outside the country. \u201cCaptain Rahmani\u2019s claim that she was harassed in the workplace is not true, because in the air force all the pilots and staff are   and highly trained people,\u201d said Col. Ayan Khan, a helicopter pilot in the Afghan Air Force. \u201cHow can they harass their female colleague who serves along them?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561751.5920532}
