[Konashankov promised a \u201ccomplex of measures\u201d would be taken to \u201cprotect the most sensitive Syrian infrastructure facilities. \u201d  The Defense Ministry also claimed the American strike was largely ineffective, stating that only 23 of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles launched by the U. S. Navy struck their targets. (The Pentagon provided a very different estimate, stating that 58 of the 59 missiles hit their targets.) \u201cThe combat effectiveness of the US massive missile attack on the Syrian air base is extremely low,\u201d Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry insisted. According to the Russian assessment, six   fighter jets and some structures at the airbase were destroyed, but the runways were not damaged. The Russians also complained that America \u201cobviously\u201d prepared for an attack on the Sharyat airbase long before Tuesday\u2019s chemical weapons attack. \u201cThe preparation of such a strike is necessary to conduct a large range of activities for exploration, planning, preparation of flight missions and bringing the missiles into full readiness for launch. For any specialist, it is clear that a decision on the missile strike on Syria was taken in Washington long before the events in the village Khan Sheikhoun,\u201d said the Defense Ministry. The Defense Ministry accused the Trump administration of carrying out the attack \u201csolely for domestic political reasons. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561900.713217}
