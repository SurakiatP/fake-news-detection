The March for Life announced a surprise VIP guest at the rally as well. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to welcome a remarkable   of rally speakers for what will truly be a historic 44th annual March for Life,\u201d said Jeanne Mancini, March for Life president. \u201cEach of our speakers exemplifies this year\u2019s theme, \u2018the power of one\u2019 in a beautiful way,\u201d noted Mancini. \u201cTheir words are sure to motivate the marchers, as well as the millions of   Americans who will be watching, who dedicate themselves to restoring a culture of life in the United States. \u201d Conway is a longstanding   advocate, and Watson last year discussed the disproportionately high number of black babies aborted at clinics such as Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider. A devout Christian, Watson told TurningPointFriends. org as Planned Parenthood celebrated its centennial anniversary, \u201cI do know that blacks kind of represent a large portion of the abortions, and I do know that honestly the whole idea with Planned Parenthood and [founder Margaret] Sanger in the past was to exterminate blacks, and it\u2019s kind of ironic that it\u2019s working. \u201d The March for Life is the world\u2019s largest   demonstration and each year draws tens of thousands of Americans from across the nation. The rally will begin at 11:45 a. m. EST and the march will start at 1:00 p. m. EST. The March for Life will begin on the grounds of the National Mall and end in front of the U. S.
