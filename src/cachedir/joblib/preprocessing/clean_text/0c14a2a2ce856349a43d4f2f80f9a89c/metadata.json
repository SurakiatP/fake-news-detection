C. on the eve of President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, obliging the police to douse them in pepper spray. I dubbed the event \u201cLoserpalooza\u201d on Twitter:[Looks like Loserpalooza was a smash. Nothing says \u201clove wins\u201d like forcing the police to   you. https:  .   \u2014   John Hayward (@Doc_0) January 20, 2017, Pepper seasoning was added to this assortment of mixed nuts outside the \u201cDeploraBall\u201d inaugural event. Politico quoted NBC News reports about the demonstrators burning a Trump hat and lugging around an inflatable elephant festooned with a \u201cRACISM\u201d banner  \u2014   because Republicans are racists, get it? See? SEE?  \u2014   and then added their own impressions of the madness:  Protesters outside the building chanted \u201cNazi scum\u201d at DeploraBall attendees as they entered the building and a DeploraBall Twitter account posted videos of the group outside chanting \u201cF \u2014   Trump. \u201d Along with the video, the DeploraBall account\u2019s post read, \u201cSHOUTING WONT CHANGE TOMORROWS OUTCOME  \u2026     CANT WAIT TO SAY PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump. \u201d The demonstrators also brought with them a projector, used to project two messages onto nearby buildings: \u201cImpeach the predatory president\u201d and \u201cbragging about grabbing a woman\u2019s genitals. \u201d Here\u2019s some video of the tear gas flowing: BREAKING: DC police mace, teargas   protests outside National Press club. Video: #disruptj20 pic. twitter.   \u2014   DCMediaGroup (@DCMediaGroup) January 20, 2017,  Here are some more postcards from the edge, as lefty mobs do their best to convince Trump voters they made the right choice in November: Tiny activist boasts of setting fires:  No   protest is complete without some child abuse, so there was a little boy telling Fox News reporter Griff Jenkins that he started a fire outside the National Press Club \u201cbecause I felt like it, and because I\u2019m just saying, \u2018Screw our president!\u201d Technically, he was saying \u201cScrew Barack Obama,\u201d who remains the current president until Trump takes the oath of office, but whoever taught him to start fires to express his unthinking rage apparently didn\u2019t bother to teach him much in the way of civics.  \u201cWe have to really be concerned about this dangerous direction our country is going in. When you come for our communities, when you come for us, and when you try to violate our rights, we will resist,\u201d a Loserpalooza spokeswoman told Jenkins. The rest of us are really concerned about   thugs blocking streets and setting things on fire. Michael Moore melts down: Were are the clowns? Quick, send in the clowns! Don\u2019t bother  \u2026     they\u2019re here. Helplessly blubbering in uncontrollable hysteria, lefty propagandist Michael Moore rolled through D. C. like a lump of cholesterol slowly passing through the veins of the city, filling his Twitter stream with bad photographs and worse poetry: Passing the White House on the Obamas last night, sound asleep inside. The country wide awake, afraid 2 close its eyes pic. twitter.   \u2014   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 20, 2017,  Just arrived in DC. Police lights flashing everywhere in the middle of the night.

Moore also attended a protest rally in New York City on Thursday night, along with such Hollywood intellectual giants as Alec Baldwin and Mark Ruffalo, where he declared President Trump would \u201cnot last four years\u201d and called for \u201ca hundred days of protest. \u201d His actor buddies should clue him in to the actual attention span of his followers. Also, he should remember that George Soros lost a ton of money betting against America after the election, and might not be able to afford 100 days of   . \u201cWe oppose totalitarianism!\u201d scream totalitarians: Enjoy the spectacle of people who fantasize about being brave resistance fighters against Trumpian tyranny blocking off checkpoints, denying others their rights to speech and assembly without a second thought: #Trump supporters trying to attend #Inauguration told \u201cthis checkpoint is closed\u201d by #DisruptJ20 protesters at #BlackLivesMatter blockade pic. twitter.   \u2014   Alexander Rubinstein (@AlexR_DC) January 20, 2017, They were still blockading intersections and getting into tussles with riot cops on Friday morning: HAPPENING NOW blockade at D and 1st!

They\u2019re interfering with the rights of others and should be arrested. https:  .   \u2014   Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 20, 2017, \u201cRights\u201d are only for people with the correct politics, Mr. Fleischer! The whole \u201coccupy\u201d strategy of the Left, from Occupy Wall Street through Black Lives Matter, is about forcing people to listen by illegally seizing property and blocking off roads. And then they wonder why so many people voted for Donald Trump when he said he\u2019d get America moving again. Peaceful, tolerant protesters throw eggs, assault Trump supporters: Gateway Pundit reported on Trump supporters getting pelted with eggs, with one woman talking about how she was struck in the head several times: James Allsup reported he was ambushed by thugs in ski masks and beaten bloody. \u201cI was wearing my \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hat, and a white male came up behind me and swung at me with a flagpole  \u2014   I kind of blacked out for a minute. Before I knew it, my head was gushing blood  \u2014   there\u2019s blood on my Trump hat,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cI\u2019m all for disagreeing, I debate people all the time and I want to engage in these discussions, but they\u2019re throwing bottles. I would be livid if people who supported Trump were doing this to Hillary supporters,\u201d Allsup added. He posted photos of the aftermath on Twitter: Here are the graphic images of the assault aftermath before being treated by EMS and taken to the hospital. #Deploraballpic. twitter.   \u2014   James Allsup (@realJamesAllsup) January 20, 2017, His Twitter feed quickly filled with caring, compassionate liberals who accused him of faking the blood, and even of faking his hospital report, but there is video of the entire assault, and you can see the thug waving his flagpole around:  That\u2019s what you get for thinking you can walk around wearing whatever you want and expressing your opinions in a city under occupation by the Army of Tolerance, buddy. Anarchists unite! Sky News caught a menacing   crew marching around with anarchist flags and threatening slogans. Nothing brings people together like a little ISIS cosplay! The funny thing is, the same people are also given to protesting globalist trade meetings that very much believe in their \u201cno borders, no nations\u201d ideology.   Trump protests are taking place in Washington https:  .   \u2014   Sky News (@SkyNews) January 20, 2017, The police have started arresting some of the   brigades, and they\u2019re not taking it well: Police clash with protesters ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s #Inauguration https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Reuters Top News (@Reuters) January 20, 2017,  Socialist mayor shuts down his own city: Not all of the fun and frolic was taking place in D. C. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \u201ccaused traffic mayhem for his own political gains,\u201d as the New York Post put it, by heading up a \u201cmassive   protest in Columbus Circle. \u201d The streets were lined with obstacles such as sand trucks and, eventually, Michael Moore. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, I just want to go home,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible of the mayor,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m appalled at what\u2019s happening here and I am angry at de Blasio\u201d were among the comments from   New Yorkers collected by the Post. The rally ended up looking like this: It looks like the Left is dissolving into one big Godwin\u2019s Law violation. They\u2019re just so   that they get to pretend they\u2019re brave heroes battling an evil dictator! These are the same people that tried, with considerable success, to shut down bakeries and pizzerias over ideological disagreements when they were in power. At this very moment, as seen above, they\u2019re using violence to shut down the free speech of others. They\u2019re displacing a huge amount of guilt for their own sins against democracy onto Trump\u2019s shoulders. He should send them a bill for therapeutic services rendered.

The UK Independent says protesters also trashed a Bank of America branch, and there were \u201cunconfirmed reports of looting. \u201d \u201cObservers said the disorder appeared to be organised, with the   group splitting from a larger protest before launching the wave of vandalism,\u201d the Independent adds.
