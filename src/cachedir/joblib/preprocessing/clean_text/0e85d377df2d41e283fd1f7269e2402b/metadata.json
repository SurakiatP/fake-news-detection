No, the Raptors were also escaping their past. All the   exits. All the blown chances. All the disappointments. On Sunday afternoon, the Raptors turned the most significant basketball game in franchise history into a citywide celebration, defeating the Heat,   in Game 7 of the teams\u2019 Eastern Conference semifinals. Kyle Lowry scored 35 points with a sore elbow, and DeMar DeRozan added 28 with a sprained thumb. \u201cI know one thing,\u201d Coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cOur guys compete. \u201d Nothing about this game was easy for the Raptors  \u2014   not against the likes of Dwyane Wade, not after seven games, not with so many   bodies. But for the first time in the team\u2019s   existence, the Raptors are bound for the conference finals. Their series with the Cleveland Cavaliers will start Tuesday night at Quicken Loans Arena. \u201cWe ain\u2019t satisfied,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cThat\u2019s just our mentality. \u201d The Raptors erupted in the third quarter, building their lead possession by possession. To 11 when DeMarre Carroll sank a  . To 14 when Bismack Biyombo got inside for a dunk. To 16 when Lowry drove to the rim for layup. The Heat trailed by as many as 28 in the fourth. \u201cThey wore us down,\u201d Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cToronto beat us, fair and square. \u201d Wade and Goran Dragic scored 16 points each for the Heat, who were greeted by light snowfall when they left their hotel for the game. About a   before tipoff, flurries gave way to hail. It was springtime in Canada, and the conditions  \u2014   at least symbolically  \u2014   favored the Raptors. (For the record, it did not snow in Miami for Game 6.) Thousands of fans filed into Jurassic Park, an outdoor viewing party on a block next to the arena. If people here were excited about the game, about this national event, then they were also opening themselves up to the possibility of more frustration, more misery, more sadness. The ghosts of postseasons past have haunted this franchise. Seven previous trips to the playoffs. Six   flameouts. It has been particularly impossible for Toronto to forget 2001, when it came within seconds of advancing to the conference finals. But Vince Carter, after attending his college graduation ceremony that morning, missed a shot at the buzzer, and the Philadelphia 76ers escaped with a Game 7 win in the conference semifinals. That was 15 years ago. The Raptors finally seized another opportunity. \u201cThis organization deserves it,\u201d DeRozan said. This was a physical series that featured nearly as many injuries as missed shots. Both teams had long ago lost their starting centers  \u2014   the Raptors\u2019 Jonas Valanciunas to a sprained right ankle, the Heat\u2019s Hassan Whiteside to a sprained right knee. Others played on, through jammed thumbs and bruised wrists, through the toll of a   series that manifested itself in bandages and braces. In Game 6, with his team hoping to extend the series, Spoelstra went small by starting Justise Winslow, a   forward, at center. Spoelstra sought to generate more offense, and he instructed Winslow to set screen after screen along the perimeter, drawing Biyombo, his primary defender, away from the basket. The Heat ran away with the win. Ahead of Game 7, Casey expressed cautious optimism that his players would make the necessary adjustments. He wanted his defenders to focus on the ball, to contain Wade and Dragic and at least slow their dribble penetration. Casey advised his players to stop worrying so much about the coming screen. \u201cToo many times, we\u2019re looking to see where the screens are coming from,\u201d Casey said, adding, \u201cWe have to do a good job of locking into the basketball. \u201d The arena practically shook when DeRozan scored the first points of the game on a midrange jumper. The crowd roared when Wade picked up his second foul and took an early seat. Neither team was particularly efficient, however, and this surprised no one after two weeks of turnovers and empty possessions. On Sunday, the Raptors and the Heat combined to miss nine of their first 10   attempts. DeRozan, though, was assertive. He scored 11 points on 12   attempts in the first quarter. Toronto took a   lead into the second half. As the game wore on, others emerged for the Raptors. Biyombo finished with 17 points, and Patrick Patterson had 11 points and 11 rebounds. \u201cI thought tonight we played big,\u201d Casey said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do that, you\u2019ve got to make sure you plant your feet in the lane and do what you do. \u201d Late in the fourth quarter, with the final seconds melting away on the Heat\u2019s season, a happy mob formed in front of the Raptors\u2019 bench. Coaches embraced. Players exchanged  . But back in the locker room, a dose of reality awaited: scouting reports on the Cavaliers, one for every player. \u201cIt\u2019s another step for us,\u201d Casey said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561764.3663445}
