Brown told him that there was a U.S. Marshal\u2019s hold on him from a pending federal indictment in Nevada. \\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s released on these charges. He\u2019s acquitted. Nevada doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction,\u201d Mumford yelled, standing before the judge. \u201cIf there\u2019s a detainer, show me.\u201d \\n\u201cMr. Mumford, you really need to never yell at me now or never again,\u201d the judge responded. \\nBrown told Mumford that she\u2019s releasing Bundy on all federal holds in the Oregon case, but he\u2019ll have to take up any questions about the federal holds from the Nevada case with the U.S. Marshals Service. \\n\u201cIf they want him, they know where to find him,\u201d Mumford told the judge. \u201cI don\u2019t see any paper proving their authority to hold him.\u201d \\nSuddenly, a group of about six to seven U.S. Marshals, who had been either standing or seated around the perimeter of the courtroom, slowly moved in and surrounded Mumford at his defense table. The judge directed them to move back but moments later, the marshals grabbed onto him. \\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Mumford yelled, as he struggled and was taken down to the floor. \\nAs deputy marshals yelled, \u201cStop resisting,\u201d the judge demanded, \u201cEverybody out of the courtroom now!\u201d \\nMumford was taken into custody by the Federal Protective Services. \\nHe was cited for failure to comply with a federal lawful order and disturbance and released with a Jan. 6 date to return to federal court, said Eric Wahlstrom, supervising deputy of the U.S. Marshals Service. \\nAccording to Wahlstrom, Mumford was shocked with a stun gun in what\u2019s called a dry-stun mode, meaning no probes were fired into his body but a Taser was placed up against his body. \\nWahlstrom, who was not in the courtroom, said the actions were taken because Mumford was resisting and preventing marshals from taking Ammon Bundy out of the courtroom and back into custody. \\nWahlstrom said the stun gun was used because deputy U.S. marshals \u201cattempted to handcuff him and he continued to resist.\u201d \\nBut observers who were close to the arrest decried the use of force against a lawyer in court. \\n\u201cWhat happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government,\u201d Mumford\u2019s co-counsel J. Morgan Philpot said. Philpot explained that Mumford was attempting to point out that since the judge previously had said in court that she had no authority over detention orders made by the court in Nevada, she couldn\u2019t now maintain the right to order his client held. \\n\u201cI grew up on a dairy farm, so am I used to some rough treatment, sure?\u201d Mumford told reporters, after his release. But he said the actions of the U.S. marshals were uncalled for. \\n\u201cAll I was asking for was papers. Just show me you have the authority to take Mr. Bundy into custody,\u201d Mumford said. \\nDefense lawyer Per C. Olson, who represented co-defendant David Fry, called the physical confrontation \u201ca complete overreaction. Utterly disgusting.\u201d \\nOlson said Mumford was getting animated, but he did nothing physical. He didn\u2019t charge the bench, or block marshals from his client. \u201cHe raised his arm as if to say, what the hell\u2026And they grabbed him, Tased him and took him down. It was just shocking. It was completely inappropriate,\u201dOlson said. \\nDefense lawyer Matthew Schindler, standby counsel for defendant Kenneth Medenbach, said he was disappointed by Mumford\u2019s challenge to his client\u2019s return to custody, considering he faces more serious federal charges in Nevada. \\nSchindler said Mumford was exhausted, having \u201cput out everything he had,\u201d during the past six weeks of the case. \\n\u201cUnfortunately he let his passion and desire and belief in his client overcome his good judgement,\u201d Schindler said. \\nMargaret \u201cMargie\u201d Paris, a University of Oregon law professor and former dean, said she couldn\u2019t believe what occurred when she learned of the confrontation. \\n\u201cIt just blows my mind,\u201d Paris said. \u201cTo have a lawyer who\u2019s making an argument in court physically restrained and taken down is extraordinary. He\u2019s entitled to make these arguments. If he was repeating himself over and over, the more typical response is to hold him in contempt. But to physically accost him is just shocking.\u201d \\nOregonian Staff Writer Jeff Manning contributed to this story. \\n\u2014 Maxine Bernstein Share: Rate:'"}, "time": 1742563987.738201}
