This independent research reveals that many popular foods have over 1000 times the glyphosate levels that have been established to be harmful. \\n\u201cWith the widespread increase in glyphosate use over the past 20 years and the fact that independent science has confirmed low level exposure to Roundup causes liver and kidney damage at only 0.05 ppb glyphosate equivalent, as reflected by changes in function of over 4000 genes, the American public should be concerned about glyphosate residues on their food. \\nAdditional research points to harmful impacts at levels between 10 ppb and 700 ppb. Considering these shocking new scientific test results, regulators must take the below findings into account during any reauthorization of glyphosate.\u201d ~ Glyphosate: Unsafe on Any Plate \\nBelow are two images that show food testing results published by Food Democracy Now! and The Detox Project, which commissioned the research. \\nFull laboratory reports for this food testing can be found here . A searchable database of results can be found here . \\nIt is no surprise that Monsanto does not want the public to know about these food safety test results. They pay-off mainstream media outlets and regulatory agencies, keeping the media silent when independent research such as this is published, so they can continue making billions from selling glyphosate. \\nThis new research is only supplement to numerous other independent studies that basically show that Monsanto is poisoning us with glyphosate and the government is doing nothing to stop it.
