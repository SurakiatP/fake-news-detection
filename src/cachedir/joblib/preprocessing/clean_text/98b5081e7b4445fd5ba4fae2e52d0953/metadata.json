Trump and lawmakers about supposed Russian plans to blackmail Mr. Trump? There are far more questions than answers. But here is a look at the story so far. \u25a0 In September 2015, a Washington political research firm, Fusion GPS, paid by a wealthy Republican donor who did not like Mr. Trump, began to compile \u201copposition research\u201d on him  \u2014   standard practice in politics. \u25a0 Last June, after evidence of Russian hacking of Democratic targets surfaced, Fusion GPS hired a retired British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. \u25a0 After it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee, Democratic clients who supported Hillary Clinton began to pay Fusion GPS for this same opposition research. \u25a0 Mr. Steele, who had long experience in Russia and a network of connections there, compiled dozens of reports detailing what he heard from his contacts. The memos he wrote, mostly one to three pages long, are dated from June to December. \u25a0 The memos contain unsubstantiated claims that Russian officials tried to obtain influence over Mr. Trump by preparing to blackmail him with sex tapes and bribe him with business deals. They also claim that the Trump campaign met with Russian operatives to discuss the Russians\u2019 hacking and leaking of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee and from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. \u25a0 Fusion GPS and Mr. Steele shared the memos first with their clients, and later with the F. B. I. and multiple journalists at The New York Times and elsewhere. The memos, totaling about 35 pages, also reached a number of members of Congress. \u25a0 Last week, when the F. B. I. C. I. A. and National Security Agency gave a classified report on the Russian hacking, leaking and efforts to influence the presidential election to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders, they attached a   summary of the unverified allegations in the memos. \u25a0 Whether any of the claims in the memos are true. American intelligence agencies have not confirmed them, and Mr. Trump has said they are a complete fabrication. In addition, one specific allegation  \u2014   that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen met with a Russian official in Prague in August or September  \u2014   has been denied by both Mr. Cohen, who says he has never been to Prague, and the Russian, Oleg Solodukhin. \u25a0 Who concocted the information in the memos, if it is entirely false or partly so, and with what purpose. If all the information in the dossier is false, it is a very sophisticated fabrication. \u25a0 What exactly prompted American intelligence officials to pass on a summary of the unvetted claims to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and Congress. Officials have said they felt the   should be aware of the memos, which had circulated widely in Washington. But putting the summary in a report that went to multiple people in Congress and the executive branch made it very likely that it would be leaked. The F. B. I. has been investigating the claims in the memos, and Democrats are demanding a thorough inquiry into the reports that Trump representatives met with Russian officials during the campaign. But as of Jan. 20, Mr. Trump will be in charge of the bureau and the other intelligence agencies, and he may not approve such an investigation. Because the 35 pages of memos prepared as opposition research on Mr. Trump contain detailed claims that neither the intelligence agencies nor The Times has been able to verify, Times editors decided to briefly summarize the claims and not publish the document. The Times did report before the election that the F. B. I. was investigating claims about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia  \u2014   an article that resulted from an extensive reporting effort. The Democratic National Committee and Podesta emails were public, their authenticity was not in doubt, and they contained newsworthy information. That is a question the director, James B. Comey, may eventually have to answer. His two public statements about the bureau\u2019s investigation of the Clinton emails broke with long F. B. I. tradition. Many reporters from multiple news organizations tried to verify the claims in the memos but were unsuccessful. CNN broke the news that a summary of the memos had been attached to the classified report by the F. B. I. C. I. A. and National Security Agency on the Russian hacking and leaking, and that it had been given to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders last week. That level of official attention prompted news organizations to decide to inform the public about the memos.'"}, "time": 1742562251.8163114}
