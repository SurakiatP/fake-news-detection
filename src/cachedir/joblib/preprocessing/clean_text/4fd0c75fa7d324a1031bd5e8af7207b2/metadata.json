Now, the Romney\u2019s have shifted targets, and want to purchase a small share of the New York Yankees. [According to Jon Heyman at FanRag, \u201cIf the deal goes through, it is expected to be $25 million to $30 million per percentage point and thought to be interested in one or two percentage points. The Yankees are valued around $3 billion or more.  \u201cMitt Romney, in response to an earlier version of this story about his potential involvement in a sale, denied that he\u2019s involved in the talks in a statement, per a spokesperson. The former governor of Massachusetts, Romney is a lifelong Red Sox fan and is sensitive to being associated with the Yankees after hearing early reaction from Red Sox fans. \u201d Romney has apparently conquered his sensitivity towards an association with the Yankees by making the purchase through his son, Tagg, as a part of the family business. According to Heyman, \u201cHowever, (Mitt Romney\u2019s) family is in talks to buy a small stake (in the Yankees) led by his son Tagg and business partner Spencer Zwick through the family company, Solamere Capital  \u2026    . Tagg is Mitt\u2019s oldest son at 46. He previously worked in marketing with the Dodgers and Reebok before founding and selling a software company. He later became a partner in a private equity firm, Solamere Capital, before working as a senior aide on his father\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008 and as an adviser in 2012. \u201d And that is apparently how you get around \u201csensitivity. \u201d There is something really gross about this whole thing. Of course, businessmen look for great business opportunities regardless of where they find them. No one becomes a billionaire by sticking to emotional fandom, or rooting interests. However, to have a   \u201clifelong Red Sox fan\u201d buy a piece of their archrival, is, again, gross. Not to say that Romney wouldn\u2019t be a good owner. He\u2019s a tremendously successful man who would no doubt have many contributions as a part of any organization. However, as a Red Sox fan, the Yankee organization is not one.
