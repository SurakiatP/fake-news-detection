Mark Sanford ( ) weighed in on Wednesday\u2019s shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, VA that resulted in Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) in critical condition at a hospital in Washington, DC.  Sanford said we were \u201cat an inflection point\u201d and we needed to return to civility, or wind up in a \u201cvery, very bad spot. \u201d \u201cIndeed, we\u2019re at an inflection point,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cThere are forces at play I\u2019ve never seen before in roughly the 20 years I\u2019ve been involved in politics. Joe and I came in together way back when. And it is indeed different. I think we have to watch out as a society because if we don\u2019t watch out, civility is indeed a part of civilized government and an open political system. And if you let these forces play out, I think we end up at a very, very bad spot. I think what happened yesterday was symptomatic of it. \u201d He went on to blame President Donald Trump in part for the toxic climate that led to this shooting. \u201c[I] would argue that the president is at least in partially  \u2014   not in any way totally  \u2014   but partially to blame for demons that have been unleashed, whether it is what I saw at a senior center back home and people saying, \u2018    and  \u2019 to each other at a senior center, a retirement center and see each other play croquet the next day, or with what happened  \u2014   not with what happened yesterday, but the fact that you know, you\u2019ve got the top guy saying, \u2018Well, I wish I could hit you in the face. And if not, why don\u2019t you and I\u2019ll pay your legal fees.\u2019 That\u2019s bizarre  \u2014   we ought to call it as such. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742562650.7658436}
