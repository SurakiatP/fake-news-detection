That\u2019s what a Los Angeles gallery is hoping to get for Kanye West\u2019s \u201cFamous\u201d sculpture, a   silicone homage to 12 of the biggest names in pop culture. Four million for George W. Bush curled in the fetal position, a     Donald J. Trump, coquettish Amber Rose and Rihanna, a cherubic Anna Wintour and Pollyannaish Taylor Swift  \u2014   a rogues\u2019 gallery including Bill Cosby, Chris Brown and Ray J, and arguably three of the most famous   in modern times: Caitlyn, Kim, and Kanye. So lifelike, they even breathe, chests rising and falling as if deep in REM sleep. Seven figures for all that  \u2014   plus the bedspread and the batteries to animate the doppelg\u00e4ngers  \u2014   a number that was floated among attendees at Blum  Poe, the gallery that hosted the private exhibition last weekend. A source close to Mr. West claimed \u201cFamous\u201d would go on tour. Others vacillated between skepticism and quiet acquiescence at the estimate. But the gallery\u2019s   Tim Blum, called it \u201ca good ballpark. \u201d \u201cI did the math in my head, and it took $500, 000 to a million just to make it,\u201d said Aaron Axelrod, a Los Angeles artist who last month startled audiences by   mapping Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Hollyhock House. \u201c This caught me off guard. It\u2019s one of the coolest pieces I\u2019ve ever seen, which is kind of annoying because it\u2019s Kanye West. \u201d Solipsism aside, the biggest wow, Mr. Axelrod says, is breathing life into the sculptures, since \u201cthis was made for the music video, no one would have been able to tell [how] those sculptures were moving. Which means he\u2019s going above and beyond. \u201d On Saturday, upon early arrival at the exhibition, technicians were still setting up a    straight out of the   classic \u201c . \u201d They toyed with audio, and plugged in   batteries to make the creations come alive. And when they did, the automatons were eerily real. Slumbering as if in a   suspended animation. Yet the most interesting part of the story is the one that didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI think Monday of last week, I got a call from Scooter Braun,\u201d said Mr. Blum of Blum  Poe, referring to the man who discovered Justin Bieber and who is now part of Mr. West\u2019s management team. \u201cKanye suddenly felt the urge to show the work,\u201d Mr. Blum continued. \u201cLong story short, we made it happen. We pushed some things around and five days later, we had a show. Monday hey, Friday open. \u201d But why open a day before Mr. West\u2019s \u201cSaint Pablo\u201d tour, two days before the V. M. A. s? It seemed sheer whim, Mr. Blum indicated. Mr. West wanted an art world unveiling, a piece that members of his creative collective, DONDA, said had taken four months of animation modeling,   scanning, stylist consulting, Instagram searches. The result was startlingly accurate. Each animatronic body was   down to the freckles and hair (human!) all applied by hand,    and none more ghoulish than Mr. Cosby\u2019s freckles or Mr. Trump\u2019s fleshy behind. Since Mr. West\u2019s \u201cGraduation\u201d album cover was crafted by Takashi Murakami, a client of Blum  Poe, the gallery was a natural fit. When asked about the multimillion price point, Mr. Blum laughed. It is on sale  \u2014   \u201cfor the right buyer,\u201d he said. When you tally the materials needed, labor and Mr. West\u2019s name, the $4 million price tag doesn\u2019t seem so outlandish. \u201cI would project a figure about that,\u201d Mr. Blum said. \u201cTo be honest, we did it for the sake of doing it,\u201d Mr. Blum continued. \u201cThe show and project were not done with price or sale in mind. But I would act upon it as every other piece of art I handle. \u201d The show lasted one weekend. Like the man himself, flighty and busy, Mr. West showed up for a few minutes via an onscreen avatar on Friday night. That\u2019s it. \u201cKanye is Kanye,\u201d said his trainer of three years, Joe Bouraima, a French national whom Mr. West had helped to secure a visa after a fortuitous 2013 meeting in Paris. Ever since, the hulking Mr. Bouraima has been on and off tour with the artist for months, training daily while working on \u201cFamous. \u201d Not once did Mr. West mention the project. And then, just like that, the mercurial Mr. West decided to stage the   show in Los Angeles  \u2014   and then it was gone. Poof. But to where? A member of Mr. West\u2019s team said that the piece was \u201con its way to its next location. \u201d She wouldn\u2019t share where, but Mr. Blum said he could picture \u201cFamous\u201d in a large museum. \u201cI have friends who are directors of museums,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a thing you could see at Lacma [Los Angeles County Museum of Art] MOCA or the Hammer very easily. \u201d Representatives from the Hammer Museum said they had no such plans, but Mr. Blum mentioned that he and Mr. Braun were actively shopping the piece\u2019s next home. The clich\u00e9 rings true that all art is imitation, and \u201cFamous\u201d was heavily inspired by Vincent Desiderio\u2019s \u201cSleep,\u201d which was based on Jackson Pollock\u2019s \u201cMural\u201d painting. And though \u201cFamous\u201d wasn\u2019t built by Mr. West\u2019s own hand, the concept and direction were his own. Ask others who borrow liberally  \u2014   such as Werner Herzog or Mr. Desiderio  \u2014   all are steadfast that this work is art. Michelangelo, Quentin Tarantino and Chuck Close, have each had assistance to make their ideas come to life. Why should this be any different? \u201cArt is really just an idea,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said. \u201cIt\u2019s follow through and direction. What makes a great artist nowadays is being able to put together a team. And he was willing to give up money to put his ideas to life. \u201d Maybe the greatest quality an artist can possess today isn\u2019t skill or talent  \u2014   it\u2019s commitment to making a vision real. That means money and time. To create something to make the masses remember your name. What else is fame for?'"}, "time": 1742564491.844966}
