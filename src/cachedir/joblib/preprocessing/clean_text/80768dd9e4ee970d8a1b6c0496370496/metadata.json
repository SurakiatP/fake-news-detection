Trump has regularly boasted about \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d his   autobiography, as a business bible that demonstrates the sharp negotiating prowess he would bring to the presidency. The book, released in 1987, details his rise to the top of New York\u2019s real estate world it helped spawn his career as a reality television star and cemented his image as a winner with a golden touch. But Tony Schwartz, the book\u2019s ghostwriter, who spent 18 months in the 1980s interviewing and shadowing Mr. Trump, says that it is really a work of fiction. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine for its July 25 issue, Mr. Schwartz explained publicly, and for the first time, what he learned from living in Mr. Trump\u2019s world. Here are some highlights. Mr. Schwartz, a former magazine writer who said he worked on the book because he needed the money, told the writer Jane Mayer that he painted Mr. Trump in the most positive light that he could, thinking that a sympathetic character would be better for the book\u2019s sales than a story about a cruel tycoon. If he could do it over again, however, Mr. Schwartz said the book would be titled \u201cThe Sociopath. \u201d \u201cI feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cI genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes, there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a living black hole!\u201d Mr. Schwartz said he used to tell his wife after long days with Mr. Trump. He described Mr. Trump as a painful interview subject who could not handle questions that required any depth to answer and who had little recollection of his youth. When pressed, Mr. Schwartz said, Mr. Trump would grow fidgety, angry and sometimes quit despite the fact that they were ostensibly working together on the book. He had no attention span, Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cIf he had to be briefed on a crisis in the Situation Room, it\u2019s impossible to imagine him paying attention over a long period of time,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said of Mr. Trump\u2019s inability to focus. People often ask Mr. Trump why he is really running for president, and he has always responded by saying that he wants to make America great. Mr. Schwartz has a different theory, explaining the bid as part of a continuum of Mr. Trump\u2019s need for attention. He recalled that as a young man, Mr. Trump was happy to receive publicity of any kind, luring the tabloids to chronicle his life. His turn as the host of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the NBC reality show, solidified him as a media star, and running for president was the next logical step, Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cIf he could run for emperor of the world, he would,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. Mr. Trump has driven many fact checkers to near madness in the last year, and Mr. Schwartz was not surprised. During the time he spent with Mr. Trump, he said, the businessman would regularly exaggerate or outright lie to get the upper hand. \u201cLying is second nature to him,\u201d Mr. Schwartz told The New Yorker. \u201cMore than anyone else I have ever met, Trump has the ability to convince himself that whatever he is saying at any given moment is true, or sort of true, or at least ought to be true. \u201d It was Mr. Schwartz who coined the phrase \u201ctruthful hyperbole,\u201d referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s notion of harmless lies, in \u201cThe Art of the Deal. \u201d He said that Mr. Trump loved the phrase. Many celebrities have ghost writers who do the bulk of the work on a book, but Mr. Schwartz said he was struck by how Mr. Trump took all of the credit but did practically none of the work. After reviewing the manuscript on which Mr. Schwartz had spent more than a year, Mr. Trump returned it with a few scribbles of a red marker, removing the names of some people he decided he did not want to criticize publicly. Although Mr. Trump claims to be the author of the best business book of all time, Howard Kaminsky, the former head of Random House, which published \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d begged to differ. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t write a postcard for us!\u201d he told The New Yorker. Mr. Trump pushed back against the accusation that he had little role in the production of the book, telling the magazine, \u201cI wrote the book. It was my book. \u201d As for Mr. Schwartz, Mr. Trump called him and expressed disappointment at how disloyal he had been. \u201cHave a nice life,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Schwartz, before hanging up.'"}, "time": 1742628521.6152592}
