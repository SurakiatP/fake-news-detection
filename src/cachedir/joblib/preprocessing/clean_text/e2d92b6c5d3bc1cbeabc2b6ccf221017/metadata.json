[Founded in 1876, Grove City College had to take its fight to refuse all federal funding to the U. S. Supreme Court in the 1980s. Pence recounted this history, telling the graduates, \u201cThe diploma that you will receive today was minted in an institution of principle and independence and you can be proud of it for the rest of your lives. \u201d  \u201cPeople follow people they respect so first and foremost you must aspire to be men and women of character,\u201d said Pence. TUNE IN! I\u2019m at @GroveCtyCollege delivering the 2017 Commencement address. Congrats, grads! #GCCGrad2017 https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Vice President Pence (@VP) May 20, 2017,  He called the crowd to servant leadership: leadership grounded in faith and freedom, not selfish ambition, that \u201cmust the the animating force of the career that lies before you. \u201d \u201cIf you aspire to lead, you\u2019ll need courage,\u201d he added after referring to a quote from C. S. Lewis, \u201cCourage was not one of the virtues it was actually a form of every virtue at the testing point. \u201d \u201cLeadership brings both honor and opposition,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnyone who dreams big will encounter those who think small, anyone who dares to step forward will find those who\u2019d rather stay put. And anyone who thinks they can will always hear from those who are sure they can\u2019t. \u201d Pence told the graduates that for an example of courage they should look no further than his friend, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald Trump. The vice president quoted the commencement message President Trump gave last Saturday at Liberty University. \u201cNothing worth doing ever came easy,\u201d he said, quoting Trump. \u201cFollowing your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the courage to do what\u2019s right. \u201d Adding his own advice, Pence urged, \u201cDon\u2019t fear criticism. Have the humility to listen to it, learn from it and most importantly, push through it. Persistence is the key. Never quit on your dreams. Dreams may be deferred by they must never be abandoned. \u201d Pence recounted some of his life story and setbacks, particularly that he actually ran twice for the U. S. Congress and was not successful in those first attempts. He encouraged the graduates to trust the dream in their hearts and \u201cnever let it go. \u201d \u201cThat dream came back around,\u201d said Pence, and he was eventually successful and able to serve in Congress, then serve as governor of Indiana and now has the privilege as serving as vice president of the United States. \u201cHold on to your calling. Never let it go,\u201d he encouraged. Pence quoted former President Calvin Coolidge: Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. talent will not. Nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not. Unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not. Well the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. He then added his own words, \u201cAnd so persistence men and women. Hold on to your dreams and drive forward. \u201d Vice President Pence declared that the graduates have been \u201ccalled to lead, fearlessly. Be men and women of integrity with a servant\u2019s heart. Expect opposition and persevere. And lastly, have faith. \u201d He quoted Jeremiah 29:11 from the Bible, as he often does, that God has a plan for them, to give them \u201chope and a future. \u201d \u201cHave faith that He that brought you this far will never leave you and never forsake you because He never will,\u201d said Pence. The Vice President said if the graduates \u201cif you hold fast to Him, to the faith that deepened in this special place and to all that you learned from this extraordinary faculty, I know in my heart of hearts, you will not only persevere, but you will prevail. \u201d . @GroveCtyCollege Class of 2017  \u2014   this is your day  \u2014   the future is yours.
