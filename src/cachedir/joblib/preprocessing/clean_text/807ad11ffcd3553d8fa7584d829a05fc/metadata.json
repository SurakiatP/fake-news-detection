John McCain ( ) Wednesday during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing focused on ending modern slavery and child sexual exploitation. [\u201cYou were   in the movies,\u201d McCain joked to Kutcher, before The Ranch star blew back a kiss in response.  Appreciate @aplusk @thorn  @ecmassimino @humanrights1st\u2019s commitment to the #enditmovement  support of #EndSlaveryAct pic. twitter.   \u2014   John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) February 15, 2017,  During the hearing Wednesday, the    actor  \u2014   who   the technology company Thorn, which builds software tools to combat child sexual exploitation and human trafficking  \u2014   delivered a   speech detailing how technology can play a role in ending the vicious practices of rape and modern slavery. \u201cThis is about the time, when I start talking about politics, that the Internet trolls start telling me to stick to my day job,\u201d Kutcher told the panel, chaired by Sen. Bob Corker ( ). But Kutcher said his day job comprised of working at Thorn to fight child sex crimes, and of being a father to two children.  \u201cI\u2019ve been on FBI raids where I\u2019ve seen things that no person should ever see,\u201d he said, appearing to choke up. \u201cI\u2019ve seen video content of a child that\u2019s the same age as mine, being raped by an American man that was a sex tourist in Cambodia, and this child was so conditioned by her environment that she thought she was engaging in play. \u201d Kutcher said his company had once received a call from the Department of Homeland Security asking for help in locating a serial sex abuser. \u201cWe were the last line of defense, an actor and his foundation, we were the potential last line of defense,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my day job, and I\u2019m sticking to it. \u201d Kutcher also discussed a tool that his company built called Spotlight, which allows law enforcement officers the ability to prioritize their case load. He said the program was already being used by more than 4, 000 law enforcement officials in over 900 agencies. \u201cThere\u2019s often a misconception about technology that in some way, it is the generator of some evil, that it\u2019s creating job displacement and that it enables violence and malice acts,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut as an entrepreneur and as a venture capitalist in the technology field, I see technology as simply a tool. A tool without will. The will is the user of that technology, and I think it\u2019s an important distinction. \u201d \u201cTechnology can be used to enable slavery, but it can also be used to disable slavery, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he added.
