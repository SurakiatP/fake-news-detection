Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s warnings about almost non-existent voter fraud were right after all. \\nThe only problem is that it was a Donald Trump supporter who committed voter fraud by voting twice. \\nTerri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into jail Thursday on a felony charge of first-degree election misconduct after being arrested for suspicion of voting twice, according to the Des Moines Register . \\nAuthorities say the registered Republican cast two electoral ballots in Polk County. She was held in jail on a $5,000 bond and released Friday. \\nTerri Rote caucused for Donald Trump: Terri Rote plans to caucus tonight for @realDonaldTrump down on the east side of Des Moines pic.twitter.com/dMdeH7sX0V \\n\u2014 Leigh Munsil (@leighmunsil) February 1, 2016 \\nThis does make it pretty awkward for Republicans, especially Trump supporters who\u2019ve been told to \u201cmonitor\u201d areas where liberals and Democrats vote, which is actually called voter intimidation and is also against the law. \\nIn fact, Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claims that the election is rigged got the Republican Party sued for voter intimidation. And now one of Trump\u2019s own supporters is arrested over voter fraud. \\nMakes sense.\""}, "time": 1742563284.9673014}
