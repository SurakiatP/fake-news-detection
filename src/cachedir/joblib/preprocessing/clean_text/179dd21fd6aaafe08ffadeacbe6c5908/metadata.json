Everything at hand is both delicious and terrible for you. And since it\u2019s just one day, is a day-long sugar binge really all that bad? Unfortunately, yes\u2014because it\u2019s never just that one day. The holiday season is upon us and Halloween marks the beginning of our collective descent into the depths of seasonal, socially-acceptable gluttony. All those surreptitious snacks add up in a big way, and not just in terms of empty calories. They\u2019re full of synthetic dyes, preservatives, artificial flavors, and inflammation-promoting refined sugar. My strongest craving is for peanut butter cups. It just doesn\u2019t feel like Halloween without peanut butter cups, but if you\u2019ve ever read the label, you know better than to eat the store-bought kind. You can do so much better by making your own vegan peanut butter cups instead. Homemade peanut butter cups can have healthier chocolate, and less than half the calories (that doesn\u2019t mean you should eat twice as many!). These peanut butter cups taste great and will satisfy any craving for sweets. In this recipe, I used 60% cocoa dark chocolate and the results were incredibly rich and satisfying, especially if you\u2019re generous with the organic natural peanut butter. Once you\u2019ve eaten peanut butter cups made with high quality (not to mention antioxidant-rich) chocolate, you won\u2019t even want the cheap, mass-produced faux-chocolate and peanut-butterish polyglycerol polyricinoleate products the big candy manufacturers make. The Origin and Politics of Peanut Butter Peanut butter seems to be a uniquely American phenomenon, but peanuts, which are actually a legume, are eaten throughout the world. Originating in eastern Bolivia, the plant spread throughout South America and the Caribbean well before Spanish explorers first noted the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of peanuts in 1502 on the island of Hispaniola. From here, peanuts traveled back to Spain and then on to Africa. [ 1 ] In the 1700s, peanuts were introduced to the United States by way of the African slave trade. Peanuts were even a food ration for slaves during the treacherous Middle Passage. [ 2 ] Once in the US, peanuts were still regarded as a food for slaves, the poor, and livestock. The peanut didn\u2019t shake this reputation until the Civil War, at which point undernourished Confederate soldiers relied on the humble, fatty, high-protein food. Peanuts became an essential part of Confederate soldiers\u2019 diets, but they did not eat peanut butter. Instead, southerners enjoyed roasted peanuts which are still a favorite southern snack. [ 3 ] We actually have John Harvey Kellogg, known for Kellogg cereal, to thank for expanding the popularity of peanut butter in the 19th century. [ 4 ] Crushed, steamed peanut paste was originally intended as a no-chew, protein-rich food for sanitarium patients. It became popular among the upper classes when wealthy former patients returned home. At this point, peanut butter still hadn\u2019t reached the masses. [ 5 ] This changed with hydrogenation, however. In 1923, Heinz became the first food manufacturer to add hydrogenated oil to peanut butter, which improved shelf stability and solved the oil separation problem. Peanut butter was finally available to everyone, but the hydrogenated oil content kept increasing. Some brands contained as much as 25% hydrogenated oil and only 75% peanut butter. [ 6 ] For 12 years, the FDA and food manufacturers argued over the appropriate percentage of peanuts that peanut butter must contain. Ultimately, peanut butter was defined as a product that contained at least 90% peanuts, and not more than 10% optional ingredients, such as salt, oil, and sugar. As we all now know, the trans fat content in hydrogenated oil is terrible for heart health. [ 6 ] Since trans fats are on their way out of the American food supply, we\u2019ve seen a shift back to \u201cnatural\u201d peanut butter, which should only contain crushed peanuts and a little salt. Unfortunately, many peanut butter makers are now adding palm oil, a saturated fat , into their no-stir peanut butter. [ 7 ] I strongly recommend the old-fashioned peanut butter, the kind with oil separation\u2014all you have to do is stir it. It has a better texture and a more peanutty taste than hydrogenated or palm oil peanut butter. Not only is palm oil ecologically unsustainable and mired in controversy, [ 8 , 9 ] it also makes peanut butter greasy and less palatable. I used natural peanut butter (just peanuts and salt) in this recipe and it worked like a dream. Read This Before Working With Chocolate First and foremost\u2014wear an apron, you won\u2019t regret it. Chocolate stained clothes are no joke! Try to avoid using a cloth kitchen towel. Chocolate can be very messy and once it solidifies it\u2019s difficult to wash out; you\u2019re better off using paper towels and lining your work surface with wax paper. Take care that you don\u2019t get ANY water in your chocolate\u2014water ruins chocolate. If you do make this mistake, DO NOT MIX the water into the chocolate, it will get ugly and strangely chunky. Just quickly grab a spoon and scoop out all the water and the afflicted chocolate.
