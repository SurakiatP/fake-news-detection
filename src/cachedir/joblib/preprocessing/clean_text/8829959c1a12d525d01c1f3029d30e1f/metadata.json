The two discussed Breitbart\u2019s coverage, the media, Russia, free speech, the shooting at a congressional baseball practice, and political rhetoric. Marlow said that Breitbart is \u201cnot going to cover the exact same stories the exact same way as all the other outlets. We\u2019ll leave that to the rest of the establishment press. We\u2019re very much   trying to highlight stories that we don\u2019t think get their fair day. \u201d After the discussion turned to Russia, Marlow stated that there was no evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice, adding, \u201cYou guys continue to talk about this story in the establishment press instead of talking about the president\u2019s agenda, which is by design. Because you guys won\u2019t apologize if it turns out there\u2019s nothing, no one will come out on MSNBC, they\u2019ll just move on to the next hysteria, and that\u2019s a huge advantage for people like me who are covering the rest of the news. \u201d Marlow later said, \u201cI love highlighting Muslim voices who are progressive and reformist and want to take out some of the misogyny and some of the hatred associated with radical elements of it. And I think that\u2019s an important place to start, but to bring back what Breitbart does different than anyone else, is we cover stories the establishment press doesn\u2019t want to cover. \u201d On free speech, Maher and Marlow agreed that if the depictions of the assassination of President Trump were of President Obama, the reaction on the left would be different. Maher then raised corporations pulling ads from people who engage in speech they do not like. Marlow said, \u201cThis really started \u2014  in my view \u2014  in the modern era, with Breitbart \u2014  where a lot of people are boycotting Breitbart. And what they\u2019re doing is, there\u2019s a lot of anonymous people online, cowardly people. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s funding them. We don\u2019t know who they are, who are putting out all of this misinformation about who we are and what we stand for, and they\u2019re trying to round up corporations to boycott us. And so, what\u2019s happened is that corporations are now deciding what\u2019s free and fair speech, who can make a living, what opinions you can make a living saying now, and, of course, now, you\u2019re seeing the right fight fire with fire and want boycotts of when the left takes it too far in their Trump hatred. So it\u2019s a very dangerous path we\u2019re on, and I really do think, Bill, and I appreciate you giving me this opportunity, people on the left and the right who are free speech advocates need to come together right now and say that corporations are not going to define the First Amendment and free speech in this country. \u201d Marlow said that he does not believe Bernie Sanders is at fault for the congressional baseball practice shooting and continued, \u201cWhen you have a climate where you have, CNN, for example, calling Breitbart to the number one platform for the Nazi salute over a video we never played and CNN played, when you have the New York Times accusing Breitbart of putting racist dog whistles out, when the media lies so much about people, calling Trump supporters racists, despicable, deplorable, all of these things over and over  \u2026    \u201d Maher cut in, \u201cThey have been racist, despicable, and deplorable. \u201d Marlow concluded, \u201cI encourage everyone to go to breitbart. . You can meet some of the Breitbart reporters, the Breitbart editors. They\u2019re the most wonderful, diverse, influential journalists on the planet, and no one is interested in their real story because they\u2019re so quick to call people racist. And it\u2019s not working. That is why so many Democrats are losing across the country.   \u2026     And so, if you want to play that game, Bill, if you want to keep calling us racists, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work for you, so please, have at it. \u201d Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo.'"}, "time": 1742562737.4328086}
