[JCTS teaches \u201cabout 50 children a day how to properly shoot and handle a gun. \u201d  According to First Coast News, Safety Officer Larry Freeman watches over JCTS. He said his dad taught him to use a gun at seven, adding, \u201cHe taught me gun safety as a young one and I\u2019ve carried that all through my life. \u201d Freeman observed: You get rid of the mystique of the gun. That way, now they know what it can do, they\u2019ve seen what it can do and they\u2019ve been taught what it can do. And then they\u2019ll know what to tell their parents if they find one, they won\u2019t be sneaking it off to see how it works and wind up killing somebody. Jacksonville parent Tony Knight agrees with Freeman. He gave his son, Tony Knight Jr. his first gun at age three and says he still stands with Jr. when he shoots, placing his hand on his shoulder to give him support. Knight said he thinks following through \u2014  continuing to teach safety and helping them use the gun \u2014  is an important part of the learning process. He believes there is no magic age at which someone can begin learning. Rather, a child who can \u201clearn and listen and follow directions\u201d is \u201cready to be taught the gun. \u201d Knight\u2019s son said, \u201cPeople may use them wrong and I think that\u2019s wrong. People should use them for hunting, shooting targets and other stuff, but not harming people. \u201d He also noted that his father taught him to respect firearms, saying, \u201cIt can hurt people, yeah dad taught me it can hurt people. \u201d Jr. added, \u201cIf I see a gun in my house I\u2019m supposed to leave it alone and tell my parents and if they\u2019re not home just leave it alone. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
