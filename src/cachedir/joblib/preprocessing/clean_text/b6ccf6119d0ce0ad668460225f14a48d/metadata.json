The dispensary was then raided as part of the enforcement program carried out by Santa Ana police, according to the lawsuit. \\nHidden video of the raid released by Pappas shows Santa Ana officers forcing Sky High customers to the floor, profanely referencing James in her wheelchair and munching on snacks. \\nThe bust,which went viral, led to the suspension of three police officers, who are no longer employed by the Santa Ana Police Department . \\nPolice have not said why the trio aren\u2019t with the department. They have been charged with misdemeanor petty theft and scheduled to be back in court next month. \\nThe lawsuit alleges police caused extensive damage and took thousands of dollars in cash along with marijuana products during the Sky High raid. \\nPappas said he is continuing to pursue petitions in Orange County Superior Court for return of money and items seized in the raid and a lawsuit that seeks other unspecified monetary damages. \\nContact the writer: 714-796-7767 [email protected] Twitter: @thechalkoutline'"}, "time": 1742562264.883391}
