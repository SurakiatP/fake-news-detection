The effort, called Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, is planned as a nonviolent intervention to defend the demonstrators from what the group calls \u201cassault and intimidation at the hands of the militarized police force. \u201d The veterans\u2019 plan coincides with an announcement on Tuesday by law enforcement officials that they may begin imposing fines to block supplies from entering the main protest camp after a mandatory evacuation order from the governor. Officials had warned earlier of a physical blockade, but the governor\u2019s office later backed away from that, Reuters said. Protesters have vowed to stay put. Opponents of the   Dakota Access Pipeline have gathered for months at the Oceti Sakowin camp, about 40 miles south of Bismarck. The Standing Rock Sioux and other Native American tribes fear the pipeline could pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds. The evacuation order issued on Monday by Gov. Jack Dalrymple cited \u201canticipated harsh weather conditions. \u201d It came before a winter storm dumped about six inches of snow and brought strong winds to the area on Monday, making roads \u201croads nearly impassable at the camp sites,\u201d according to Doualy Xaykaothao of Minnesota Public Radio, who was cited by NPR. The governor\u2019s statement said, \u201cAny person who chooses to enter,   or stay in the evacuation does so at their own risk. \u201d The order was effective immediately and was to remain in place indefinitely. The veterans\u2019 effort will also run up against a plan by the Army Corps of Engineers to close off access to the protesters\u2019 campsite and create a \u201cfree speech zone. \u201d Federal officials said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing. \u201cYeah, good luck with that,\u201d Michael A. Wood Jr. a founder of the veterans\u2019 event, said in an interview. Mr. Wood, who served in the Marine Corps, organized the event with Wesley Clark Jr. a screenwriter, activist and son of Wesley K. Clark, the retired Army general and onetime supreme allied commander in Europe for NATO. Mr. Wood said he had initially hoped to attract about 500 veterans he had to stop   when they reached 2, 000. He said volunteers are from diverse backgrounds: \u201cWe have every age, we have every war. \u201d An online   has drawn over $570, 000 in pledges as of Tuesday afternoon to pay for food, transportation and supplies for the veterans\u2019 \u201cmuster,\u201d which was planned for Dec.  . One veteran, Loreal Black Shawl, said the mission to support the protesters was intensely personal. Ms. Black Shawl, 39, of Rio Rancho, N. M. is a descendant of two Native American tribes, the Oglala Lakota and Northern Arapaho. She served in the Army for nearly eight years, finishing her career as a sergeant. \u201cO. K. are you going to treat us veterans who have served our country in the same way as you have those water protectors?\u201d Ms. Black Shawl said, referring to the protesters. \u201cWe\u2019re not there to create chaos. We are there because we are tired of seeing the water protectors being treated as  . \u201d The authorities have used rubber bullets, pepper spray and water cannons against demonstrators, hundreds of whom have been injured, according to protest organizers. The clashes have been highly contentious, with the police and demonstrators leveling accusations of violence at each other. Some protesters filed a   lawsuit on Monday against the Morton County police and others, alleging excessive use of force and seeking a court injunction to prevent the authorities from using rubber bullets, explosive grenades and water cannons, according to The Atlantic. One woman was injured and in danger of losing her arm after an explosion at the protest site this month. By spotlighting issues such as the use of force by the police, national energy policies and the treatment of Native Americans, the protests have garnered national headlines and widespread attention on social media. Ms. Black Shawl acknowledged that the operation could prove problematic because the veterans and the police both have military or tactical training. She said she had a \u201chuge, huge nervousness and anxiety\u201d about possibly being injured and what could happen to other veterans. An \u201coperations order\u201d for participants outlined the logistics with military precision and language, referring to opposing forces, friendly forces and supporting units. Organizers encouraged attendees to wear their old uniforms. Mr. Wood said they were discouraging   service members from attending. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for them to get into hot water,\u201d he said. In a break from military custom, the gathering will have a \u201cchain of responsibility\u201d instead of a chain of command, he said. There are no ranks, and participants will refer to one another by their given names. Mr. Wood said the early stages of the event will be logistical: setting up tents and organizing food supplies. The first arrivals are expected on Wednesday. The premise is for the veterans to be fully   he said. \u201cThere will be civilian and tribe members watching us from behind but nobody supporting us,\u201d the operations order said. \u201cWe are the cavalry. \u201d A spokesman for the North Dakota State Highway Patrol, Lt. Thomas O. Iverson, said in an email on Monday, \u201cLaw enforcement is aware of the upcoming event planned for December  . \u201d He added, \u201cIf the group remains lawful and refrains from blocking the roadway, there will be no issues. \u201d Some officials expressed the hope that the demonstrators would move on. \u201cThe   and property of ranchers, farmers and everyone else living in the region should not be threatened by protesters who are willing to commit acts of violence,\u201d Senator John Hoeven, a Republican, said in a statement on Friday, The Associated Press reported. The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Dave Archambault II, said in an email that he had no concerns that tensions could escalate. \u201cEveryone that comes knows our intent  \u2014   to remain in peace and prayer,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562209.720604}
