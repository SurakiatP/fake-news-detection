The series is called Luminary , and it tells the story of a mild-mannered Caucasian man named Percy Pendleton who gains incredible superhuman powers and constantly expresses his regret that he was blessed with those abilities instead of a Latina woman, who could be a role model for young Hispanic girls in addition to merely fighting crime. \\nYes! Marvel deserves major kudos for this massive step toward inclusive representation in comics! \\nWhile working as a nuclear physicist at Stark Industries, Percy is caught in a particle-accelerator explosion. A surge of neutrinos floods his nervous system and transforms him into the incredible Luminary, a hero whose amazing powers of flight, super strength, and energy manipulation make him concerned that as a white man he does nothing to reflect the face of a changing America, which is increasingly Hispanic and female. \\nWow. What a long-overdue breath of fresh air to see a big-name publisher like Marvel feature a white male superhero who thinks it\u2019s a shame he isn\u2019t Latina. \\nFor a glimpse of the groundbreaking work you can look forward to in Luminary #1, check out these sample panels Marvel released earlier this week: \\nAwesome. Thanks, Marvel, for proving that white men who wish Latinas had better opportunities can be superheroes, too! We can\u2019t wait to read the first issue!'"}, "time": 1742561929.5450153}
