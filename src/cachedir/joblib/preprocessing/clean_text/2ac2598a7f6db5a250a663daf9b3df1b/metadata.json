And therefore it was concerning to see that the man who ran that Obama agency for years, the disgraced Eric Holder, has gotten himself a new,   gig. [On January 4 liberal California legislative leaders announced that they are using tax dollars to hire former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm to assist them in anticipated federal challenges to several state policies such as climate change and immigration.  Leftists controlling the Democratic Party are especially concerned that a new Trump administration might actually start enforcing the rule of law against California\u2019s dangerous and unlawful sanctuary policies.  Evidently, Eric Holder will waste taxpayer funds defending this lawlessness.  In a statement, Kevin de Leon, California Senate President Pro Tempore, said, \u201cWith the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead. \u201d The California Attorney General, who represents the State\u2019s interest in court, already has a budget of $190 million. In response, we have filed a records request with the California Legislature Joint Rules Committee seeking to examine legislative records regarding the state\u2019s employment of former Obama U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.: All contracts between the California Legislature and former U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. or Covington and Burling. All communications between the California Legislature and former U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. or Covington and Burling about the Legislature\u2019s retention of Holder   Covington and Burling. Holder was one of Obama\u2019s   and most controversial Cabinet members. On June 28, 2012, he became the first U. S. Attorney General to be held in contempt of Congress on both civil and criminal grounds. The contempt charge came in connection with Holder\u2019s refusal to turn over documents about his agency\u2019s lies on Operation Fast and Furious, the Obama administration\u2019s   scandal. JW exposed numerous outrages associated with this scandal. Under Holder the Justice Department dismissed its voting rights case against the New Black Panther Party. The Justice Department originally filed its lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party following an incident that took place outside of a Philadelphia polling station on November 4, 2008. According to multiple witnesses, members of the New Black Panthers blocked access to polling stations, harassed voters and hurled racial epithets. A video of the incident, showing a member of the New Black Panther Party brandishing a   baton weapon, was widely distributed on the Internet. JW exposed a number of Obama DOJ lies regarding the Black Panthers, which a federal judge validated in Judicial Watch v. United States Department of Justice (No. 1:  ). In 2013, the Obama Justice Department was caught spying on The Associated Press by collecting months\u2019 worth of phone records of reporters and editors.  Fox News\u2019 James Rosen was among those targeted by Holder\u2019s Justice Department. Thanks in part to JW\u2019s success in exposing his corruption, Holder was forced to resign from the Justice Department in 2015 and rejoin his old law firm of Covington  Burling. Our records request is designed to expose how California state legislators are wasting tax dollars to take care of another corrupt politician  \u2014   Eric Holder  \u2014   with the intention of deliberately resisting the rule of law on immigration and other matters. His record at the Clinton and Obama Justice Departments demonstrates a willingness to bend the law in order to protect his political patrons.'"}, "time": 1742562321.8776183}
