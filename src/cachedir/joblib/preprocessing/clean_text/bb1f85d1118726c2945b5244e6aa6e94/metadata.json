We drove past     houses and   businesses  \u2014   shuttered restaurants, a decrepit gas station  \u2014   as Iles, an   retired lunchroom worker and community activist, guided me toward the muddy banks of the Red River. Near there stands the   Art Deco shell of the Huey P. Long hospital, which once served the poorest of the poor in Rapides Parish  \u2014   and employed more than 300 workers. When employers leave towns like Pineville, they often do it with a deaf ear to the pleading of state and local governments. But in the case of Huey P. Long, the employer was the government itself. Its demise began, arguably, in 2008, when Bobby Jindal was swept into the Louisiana governor\u2019s mansion on a     platform, promising to modernize the state and unleash the power of American private industry along the Gulf Coast. At the time, Louisiana was flush with federal funds for Hurricane Katrina reconstruction and running a budget surplus. Jindal and the State Legislature slashed income taxes and started privatizing and cutting. This was a source of great pride for Jindal. During his failed bid for the presidency last year, he boasted that bureaucrats are now an endangered species in Louisiana. \u201cI\u2019ve laid off more of them than Trump has fired people,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve cut my state\u2019s budget by more than he\u2019s worth. \u201d He laid off more than just bureaucrats. Jindal cut appropriations for higher education, shifting the cost burden onto students themselves. (State spending per student was down more than 40 percent between 2008 and 2014 just one state, Arizona, cut more.) And he shuttered or privatized nine charity hospitals that served the state\u2019s uninsured and indigent. They were outdated and costly, Jindal argued, and private management would improve access, care and the bottom line. Huey P. Long was one of those hospitals. Iles, along with dozens of other workers and activists, helped organize a protest against the cuts, she told me. They held a vigil on the hospital\u2019s front lawn. Iles even helped produce an   documentary called \u201cBad Medicine\u201d that was broadcast on local television. But it was all for naught. \u201cThe good governor did not want to listen to us,\u201d Iles said, checking her constantly buzzing phone in the car. The hospital closed its doors in 2014, and its patients were redirected to other local medical centers and clinics. All of the hospital\u2019s workers lost their jobs. Driving around Pineville, Iles and I dropped in on a friend of hers from church, Theresa Jardoin, 68, who worked in the hospital for 41 years, most recently as an EKG supervisor. Out of work, she spends most of her days at home, taking care of her family. Earlier, Iles had introduced me to another friend, Linette Richard, whose story was similar. She had been working as an ultrasound technician when the hospital closed. She lost much of what she had been expecting for her retirement, because she had not been there long enough. \u201cNobody\u2019s jumping to hire a    especially in my field,\u201d Richard said. \u201cYou can get a   job, like McDonald\u2019s or Burger King. But higher up? We don\u2019t have positions available. That\u2019s the way it is. \u201d That\u2019s the way it is across much of Louisiana. The state has added 80, 000 new jobs since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009. But at the same time, jobs have been shrinking at every level of government, with local offices losing 10, 600 workers, the state government 31, 900 and the federal government 1, 600. Louisiana is an exaggerated case, but the pattern persists when you look at the country as a whole. Since the recession hit, private employers have added five million jobs and the government has lost 323, 000. The country has recovered from the recession. But public employment has not. The public sector has long been home to the sorts of jobs that lift people into the middle class and keep them there. These are jobs that have predictable hours, stable pay and protection from arbitrary layoffs, particularly for those without college or graduate degrees. They\u2019re also more likely to be unionized less than 7 percent of   workers are represented by a union, while more than a third of those in the public sector are. In other words, they look like the   jobs our middle class was built on during the postwar years. The public sector\u2019s slow decimation is one of the unheralded reasons that the middle class has shrunk as the ranks of the poor and the rich have swollen in the   years. This is certainly true in Louisiana, where five of the 10 biggest employers are public institutions, or health centers that in no small part rely on public funds. In Rapides Parish, which includes Pineville, the biggest employer is the school district. Across the country, when   workers lose their jobs, the burden disproportionately falls on black workers, and particularly women  \u2014   people like Theresa Jardoin and Linette Richard. \u201cWe felt middle class,\u201d Richard told me. \u201cNow we feel kind of lower. \u201d In the middle of the last century, a series of legal and legislative decisions  \u2014   fueled by and fueling the civil rights movement  \u2014   increased the number of black workers in government employment. F. D. R. ended official discrimination in the federal government and in companies engaged in the war effort Truman desegregated the armed forces Kennedy established the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and Johnson signed an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors. As a result, black workers gained more than a quarter of new federal jobs created between 1961 and 1965. And the share of government jobs held by women climbed 70 percent between 1964 and 1974, and nearly another 30 percent by the early 1980s. Through the middle of the century, the wage gap between white and black workers narrowed as social forces and political pressure compelled private businesses to open up better jobs to black workers. \u201c  work has been a backbone of the black middle class for many reasons,\u201d says Mary Pattillo, a sociologist at Northwestern who studies race and class. Affirmative action helped bring marginalized groups into the public work force there, they benefited from more public scrutiny of employment practices. \u201cThe inability to fire people in a   fashion has likely protected   who are perhaps likely to be fired in a   fashion,\u201d she says. As of 2007, black workers were 30 percent more likely than workers of other races to be employed in the public sector. For any number of reasons, the Great Recession unraveled much of the progress made by the black middle class. Leading up to the mortgage crisis, black families tended to have a higher proportion of their wealth tied up in their homes. And regardless of their income, black families were much more likely to be rejected for conventional mortgages and pushed into   subprime loans. All of this meant that when housing prices turned down, the   wealth gap yawned. As of 2013, white households were, on average, 13 times wealthier than black households, the biggest gap since 1989, according to Pew Research Center data. Declining tax revenue led to tightened state budgets, which led to tens of thousands of layoffs for   employees. And during the recovery, public workers became easy political targets precisely because of their labor protections.   rights, pension funds and mandatory raises look like unnecessary drains on state coffers to a work force increasingly unfamiliar with such benefits. And when the layoffs came, black Americans experienced a disproportionate share of the ill effects. A graduate student of sociology at the University of Washington, Jennifer Laird, wrote a widely cited dissertation, examining the effects of   layoffs on different races. She found that the   unemployment rate climbed more for black men than for white men  \u2014   and much more for black women than for white women, with the gap between the two groups soaring from less than a percentage point in 2008 to 5. 5 percentage points in 2011. \u201cIt may be that black workers are more likely to be laid off when the layoffs are triggered by a sudden and significant reduction in funding,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen the number of layoff decisions increases, managers have more opportunities to discriminate. \u201d Worse, once unemployed, black women were \u201cthe least likely to find   employment and the most likely to make a full exit from the labor force. \u201d As a result of all these economic punishments, a recession that set America back half a decade may have set black families back a whole generation, if not longer. And because the public sector provides so many essential services, cuts to it have a cascading effect. Hospitals close, and people have to drive farther away for medical care. Teachers\u2019 aides lose their positions, and local kids no longer have the same degree of   attention. Angelina Iles, the retiree I met in Pineville, cited the loss of dental,   and emergency medical services as being a particularly profound problem for her community. Other states and towns are electing to have smaller public work forces. Wisconsin, for instance, has thinned its ranks of government workers by some 5, 000 since its Republican governor, Scott Walker, led a push to abrogate public workers\u2019 organizing rights  \u2014   a political choice with profound economic and racial ramifications. \u201cThey try to say that collective bargaining is a drain on the economy, when it provides the ability and opportunity for folks to have a seat at the table,\u201d Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, told me. And the economic evidence does show that a higher concentration of unionized workers increases intergenerational mobility and raises wages for all workers, public and private. With time, government jobs should come back that pathway to the middle class should grow again. \u201cGovernment jobs are always slower to come back after a recession,\u201d says Roderick Harrison, a former Howard University demographer. It takes time for private businesses to rehire workers. It takes time for tax revenue to rise to a level at which cities and states feel comfortable adding public workers back onto their payrolls. \u201cThat means that the portion of the black middle class that was dependent on government jobs  \u2014   police, schools, emergency workers and so on  \u2014   is going to take longer to recoup and regain whatever positions they had,\u201d he says. For Pineville, that recovery might come too late for many of its workers, especially those who were looking toward retirement. Because Linette Richard can\u2019t find suitable work, she and her husband get by on what he makes as a car salesman. She has given up trying to find work again around Pineville. So has Theresa Jardoin, who has resigned herself to a tougher retirement than she thought she would enjoy. \u201cAll of a sudden, there\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, sitting in an easy chair in her living room, just blocks from Huey P. Long, playing with her granddaughter\u2019s hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t enjoy retirement in this situation. \u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t even get a pocket watch, did you?\u201d Iles asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Jardoin said, with a resigned laugh. \u201cJust aches and pains. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564223.0831094}
