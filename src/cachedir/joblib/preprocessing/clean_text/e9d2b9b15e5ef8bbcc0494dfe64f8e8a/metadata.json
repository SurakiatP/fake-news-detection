[Detective Daniel Bardwell became paralyzed after becoming infected following a surgery to repair damage caused by a   illness. Doctors diagnosed the   police veteran with Crohn\u2019s disease at the age of 17, Fox News reported. Despite the illness, he joined the police force.  Several times, Bardwell underwent painful surgeries to repair damage to his intestines. However, in August, he encountered something he never dreamed he would face. Following his surgery, Barwell developed a staph infection that left the police officer paralyzed from the chest down.  The infection settled in the detective\u2019s spine, WFAA reported. He went to sleep one night with a pain in his neck. When he awoke, he could no longer move anything below his chest. \u201cIf you\u2019d have given me a choice of a million things that would have happened, this is not one,\u201d Bardwell told the Fox News reporter. For months, the police detective has struggled through treatments and therapy to attempt to overcome this setback and return to the job he loves. \u201cAll of a sudden, something like this happens and you realize all the components that actually go into standing up,\u201d he explained. The detective, who works in the crimes against people unit of the Frisco Police Department is not facing the challenge of recovery alone. Bardwell\u2019s wife of 18 years, Jill, is standing by her man. She said she is excited about the progress he is making. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen from a toe wiggle to finger movement to being able to lift his right leg,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd with each of those, we just celebrate. \u201d She said his goal is to walk again. \u201cDaniel says it is a matter of when, not if. Maggie Lastukhin, a physical therapist at Baylor University Medical Center, told WFAA, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a work ethic like his before. He never says no. He never complains. \u201d His fellow officers are also doing what they can to help by raising money for a wheelchair accessible van. The goal is for Bardwell to be able to drive himself to work when he is ready to return, officials said. \u201cEverybody wants to help to do their part, whatever it may be  \u2014   little or big,\u201d Officer Ryan Chandler told Fox 4 News reporters. \u201cSo I think that they are really feeling that love from the police department now. \u201d The community of Frisco is also chipping in. A local Schlotzsky\u2019s Deli is donating a portion of this weekend\u2019s proceeds. Others have set up a \u201cYouCaring\u201d account to help with expenses not covered by insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s been humbling. That\u2019s the best word to use when I think about all the support we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Daniel told WFAA reporters about the support he has received.
