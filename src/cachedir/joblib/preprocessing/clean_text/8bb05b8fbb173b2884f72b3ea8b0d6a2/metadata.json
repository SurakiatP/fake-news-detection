[\u201cFollowing the first disastrous month of his administration, Trump is expected to articulate a discriminatory agenda that continues to put people in harm\u2019s way, undermines equality and our shared values, and damages our environment,\u201d the group Advocates Resisting Trump Agenda said in a statement announcing the rally.  \u201cThe rally will feature speakers from diverse organizations and groups of people who have been impacted and harmed by the Trump administration\u2019s policies, including women, people of color and members of the LGBTQ community, as well as environmental and immigrants\u2019 rights groups,\u201d the statement read. The rally  \u2014   dubbed \u201cA Resistance Address: Defending American Values in a Time of Moral Crisis\u201d  \u2014   is set to begin Tuesday at 6 p. m. Eastern. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s   public feud with Trump reached a new low after the election when the former View host shared a video on social media that questioned whether or not Trump\u2019s youngest son, Barron, was autistic. While O\u2019Donnell eventually apologized to Melania Trump for attacking her    the   comedienne ratcheted up her criticism of Trump\u2019s administration. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s participation in the   rally comes on the heels of her failed bid to play Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon on Saturday Night Live.  Among the list of   organizations participating in Tuesday\u2019s protest outside the White House in Washington\u2019s Lafayette Park are the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and   websites DailyKos and MoveOn. org. The event starts at 6pm EST and will stream live online.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742563908.6407187}
