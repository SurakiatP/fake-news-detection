But, when Hillary lost on Tuesday, that meant something incredible for Kimberly: She still gets to dream of being the first female president. \\nWow! This must be a truly special moment for Kimberly. \\nThe moment Hillary Clinton made her concession speech Wednesday morning, Kimberly\u2019s opportunity to become the first woman elected to the Oval Office opened right back up. Though it may not be for 40, 50, maybe even 60 years, this key milestone in feminism is all Kimberly\u2019s to aspire toward. \\nSome may say that another woman will be elected the first female president in the three decades before Kimberly\u2019s even eligible to run, but if the 2016 election is any indication, it looks like she is still very much in the running to break the gender barrier in the Oval Office. Who knows? Kimberly could even be the first female president to re-legalize abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned at some point in the next four years! \\nIt must feel truly incredible for girls in America to see that this huge accomplishment is still on the table, theirs for the eventual taking. The fact that America\u2019s ugliest, most intolerant tendencies prevailed over Clinton means millions of girls can still envisage themselves as the one to make that landmark feminist achievement, and it doesn\u2019t get more powerful than that. \\nYup, we\u2019re uplifted as hell right now\u2014you go, Kimberly! When the time comes, you can certainly count on our vote.'"}, "time": 1742562176.885659}
