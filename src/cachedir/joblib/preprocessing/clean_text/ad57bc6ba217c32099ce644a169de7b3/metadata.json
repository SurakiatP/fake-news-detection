[The two Republican leaders spoke to reporters after the meeting, which preceded the president\u2019s joint address to members of Congress on Tuesday.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bold agenda ahead of us, and the president is going to lay it out and why it\u2019s going to make a difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Ryan said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he looked forward to a \u201cpositive upbeat\u201d message from Trump, promising that the Republicans\u2019 agenda would be \u201cexactly the same as the Trump agenda. \u201d Ryan said House Republicans would be rolling out a House plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with a better plan that would give Americans \u201cchoice and freedom\u201d instead of a mandatory plan that was in a \u201cdeath spiral. \u201d That plan would likely be released in the spring, he confirmed. Reporters asked Ryan whether he would support Trump\u2019s budget, even though it was unlikely to include entitlement reforms to Social Security and Medicare. \u201cRepealing and replacing Obamacare is fundamental entitlement reform,\u201d Ryan replied.'"}, "time": 1742563680.5057096}
