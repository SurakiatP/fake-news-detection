After a quick meeting with the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, PM Sharif, like his Indian counterpart, decided to announce his decision in a nationally televised address to the nation. \\n\u201c Bhaiyon aur behnon! \u201d he roared, adopting a tone similar to Modi\u2019s, \u201cthere comes a time in the history of a country\u2019s development when a need is felt for a strong and decisive step. For years, this country has felt that corruption, black money and terrorism are festering sores, holding us back in the race towards development. Terrorism is a frightening threat. Have you ever wondered how terrorists get their money? Enemies across the border \u2013 RAW agents to be specific \u2013 run their operations by printing fake Pakistani currency!\u201d \\nNawaz paused to take a sip of water. \\n\u201c Bhaiyon aur behnon! To break the grip of corruption and black money, we have decided that from midnight tonight, the Rs 5000 note and Rs 1000 note will no longer be legal tend\u2026\u201d \\nAt this point, Sharif\u2019s address to the nation was rudely interrupted by army chief General Raheel Sharif who barged into the frame and landed a stinging slap on the PM\u2019s face. \\n\u201c Bhaag yahan se! [Get out of here!]\u201d the army chief barked. \\nHolding a hand to his reddened cheek, the shamefaced PM slowly got up and walked out. General Sharif turned to the camera. \\n\u201cIgnore whatever he said. Things will continue as usual,\u201d he said, before turning it off.
