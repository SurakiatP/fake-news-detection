[The article channels the   laments of establishment Republicans who signed the two main \u201cNever Trump\u201d letters during the GOP primaries.  Before he won, the conversation was, \u2018We really would love for you to change your mind and join us,\u2019\\u2009\u201d Peter Feaver, a National Security Council special adviser under President George W. Bush, said of informal talks with Trump aides. Feaver, who signed both letters, added that, \u201cSince he won .\\u2009.\\u2009. the conversation is, \u2018There likely will be a blacklist of people who signed the letters who won\u2019t themselves be eligible for a post. \u2019\u201d The \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans signed public letters saying Trump \u201cwould be the most reckless president in American history. \u201d Now that Trump is about to take office, they\u2019re prepared to nobly serve their country, but only if Trump will come to his senses and hire them. The Washington Post portrays the routine job consideration of applicant\u2019s loyalty as something sinister and frightening as it presents responses from Republicans surprised they are now unwelcome. According to the Post: \u201cIt\u2019s hostile,\u201d said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of further retribution. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that we\u2019re frozen out  \u2026     I was told they said there was an enemies list. \u201d Still, the Post\u2019s editors are standing up for the Republicans they like. \u201cThe   has virtually no experience in national security and foreign policy, and his transition team could presumably benefit from the broadest pool of applicants for the influential appointive positions in the State Department, Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security,\u201d the Post snipes. \u201c[T]he purportedly blacklisted figures report to their jobs at Washington law firms and think tanks in a state of indefinite limbo as their colleagues, some working in the same offices, are flirting with potential administration jobs. \u201d Unhappily for those in the D. C. holding pens, the Trump administration has rejected much of Washington\u2019s   culture and is staffing key posts with military and business leaders. \u201cThe   favors people who have been successful in the private sector and amassed personal wealth over those who have achieved prominence in academic or policy fields,\u201d the Post writes in another article. \u201cThose close to him  \u2026     see think tanks as part of a Washington culture that has failed to implement good governance, while becoming beholden to donors. \u201d The same elite that attended the same schools, lives ensconced in the same wealthy zip codes, holds the same narrow views on trade, immigration, and war, are now competing with an alternative elite brought in by Trump. Given their vitriol during the campaign, and the weeping and gnashing of teeth after Trump\u2019s election night win, getting passed over for an administration job should not be a surprise. But the political class thinks it\u2019s indispensable, and there would be no consequences for them. They believed the 2016 election would be a polite argument between the Clinton and Bush dynasties \u2014  and Trump would never win. What the Washington Post calls \u201cestablishment  \u201d find themselves shut out of shaping the future of the country with no one to blame but themselves.
