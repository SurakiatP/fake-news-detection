[With buzz surrounding the Academy Awards heating up just days before the show, Jackie says that instead of armchair critics debating whether La La Land or Moonlight will win Best Picture, the country should be focused on recognizing a different group of   Americans.  \u201cThe most important conversation in America now is about which movie [will win] which Oscar  \u2026    . who cares?\u201d Jackie says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to affect your life it\u2019s not going to make any difference. You know what we should be discussing? Who\u2019s the best plumber. Because a plumber is a lot more important than an actor. And you know what\u2019s more important than a movie? A toilet. \u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t get into a toilet, you\u2019re in a lot of trouble. You can\u2019t get into a movie, who cares?\u201d he added. \u201cYou ever see a guy who can\u2019t get into a toilet? Can\u2019t walk, can\u2019t move. It looks like he was hit by lightning. \u201d Besides, Jackie explains, an awards show for plumbers would be a lot more entertaining than watching movie stars all say the exact same thing in their Oscars acceptance speeches: \u201cTo hell with Trump. \u201d It will be a contest to see which actor can say they hate Trump the most, Jackie says: \u201c\u2018I want to thank my daughter, my cousin and my     \u2026     you thought [the previous guy] hated Trump? That\u2019s nothing compared to how much I hate Trump.\u2019 And then another guy: \u2018Do you know how much those two people hate Trump? That\u2019s nothing compared to what I wish on Trump, and I hope he gets it faster than everybody else gets it. \u2019\u201d Either way, Jackie\u2019s probably tuning out.
