On a raw morning that felt more like winter than spring, they gathered in the little red brick Mount Zion Baptist Church in South Jamaica, Queens, where Mr. Caughman\u2019s father had once been a pastor. They sang the praise of Mr. Caughman  \u2014   66 when he was killed by an attacker armed with a sword on the night of March 20 while scavenging in Midtown  \u2014   as an individual of quiet dignity and broad interests. James Harris Jackson, 28, a white man from Baltimore, has been arrested in his killing and charged with murder as terrorism. The police and prosecutors said he told investigators that he came to New York intending to kill black men. Mr. Caughman was his only victim. On Saturday, Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke for 17 minutes at Mount Zion, towering over the pulpit and over Mr. Caughman\u2019s garlanded coffin. His rhetorical sparks resonated among appreciative mourners. The mayor\u2019s most respectful gesture may have been his simple presence. As if to make a point by his own example that Mr. Caughman had been transformed by events into an Everyman of New York City, Mr. de Blasio remained for the entire funeral, which lasted almost two hours. He sat next to the pastor, the Rev. Christopher N. Howard. He bowed his head when that was called for. He stood and clapped his hands as the chorus sang \u201cWe\u2019ll Understand It Better By and By,\u201d when it would have been impossible to do anything else. \u201cHe stayed,\u201d Mr. Howard said after the service, standing atop the steps of the church while Mr. Caughman\u2019s extended family  \u2014   Caughmans, Peeks and Johnsons  \u2014   prepared to depart for Flushing Cemetery in Queens for the burial. \u201cWhen the mayor comes like that, it means the world to us in South Jamaica. \u201d The mayor\u2019s remarks were spirited enough to earn him the title \u201cReverend de Blasio\u201d from Letitia A. James, the city\u2019s public advocate, who followed him to the pulpit. As a pastor, Mr. de Blasio was not entirely conciliatory. Running for   and dogged by a sometimes tense relationship with reporters, he obliquely mentioned newspaper articles that had discussed Mr. Caughman\u2019s relatively minor criminal record. \u201cThere were news reports about this man that somehow dwelt on something that happened to him that happened to every single one of us in this room,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cwhich is, somewhere along the way, we made a mistake. So why, if he\u2019s a victim, an innocent victim of a racist attack, does any reporter want to talk about a mistake he made along the way. Why is that pertinent?\u201d As murmurs of assent began building, Mr. de Blasio declared, \u201cWhat\u2019s pertinent is that he was the victim of a racist attack. \u201d At that, there was applause. \u201cLet me be straightforward,\u201d Mr. de Blasio continued. \u201cWhat if it had been a black man who traveled to another city for the sole purpose  \u2014   \u201d when a standing ovation made it impossible to hear the rest of the sentence. \u201cWould that have been   news? Day after day?\u201d \u201cStill,\u201d came the quiet answer from Kathy   who knew Mr. Caughman when they were growing up in the South Jamaica Houses, a housing project just a few blocks down 107th Avenue from Mount Zion. Again, the mayor asked: \u201cWhat if  \u2014   instead of an older man of modest means  \u2014   it had been a banker or a lawyer or a celebrity, an actor or an actress? Don\u2019t you think that would then still be dominating our attention?\u201d And again Ms.   answered, not quite under her breath: \u201cEvery single day. Every channel. \u201d To the people of the South Jamaica Houses  \u2014   the \u201c40 Projects,\u201d as they are called because of the presence nearby of Public School 40  \u2014   Mr. Caughman was Hard Rock not one to start a fight, but not one to a leave a fight unfinished, either. For 20 years, he lived in the Barbour Hotel on West 36th Street in Manhattan, which houses formerly homeless people transitioning to permanent housing. Because of that, Mr. Caughman was initially assumed to have been homeless. But he was actually a permanent resident. \u201cHe would never have been homeless,\u201d said Mr. Caughman\u2019s    Charles W. Johnson. \u201cNot with the family he had on both sides. \u201d The nickels he got from redeeming recyclable cans and bottles were used, in part, to help finance trips to Washington, where he enjoyed attending congressional hearings, said a cousin, Richard Peek. The photograph of Mr. Caughman that has been used to illustrate many news accounts was a selfie he took last year on Election Day. \u201cStanding on line waiting to vote I love america,\u201d he posted on Twitter. Three days later, Mr. Caughman posted, \u201c\u2018Build the wall\u2019 chants and swastikas in schools  \u2014   hate crimes reports surge in US after Trump win. \u201d No matter the subject, Mr. Caughman was always an engaging conversationalist, said Portia Clark, who had known him since they were teenagers. She remembered being a fast walker as a girl and always cursing her fate just a bit when she ran into young Tim Hard Rock. \u201cI knew I had to slow down because I knew it was going to be a conversation,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cBut thank God I did because every conversation was enlightening and educational. \u201d Her husband, Carl Nimmons, stood in the aisle of Mount Zion and glanced over at the body of Mr. Caughman, in a brilliant robe of green polished cotton, a leather crown and white gloves to cover the scars on his hands from trying to fend off the man who killed him. Mr. Nimmons described a   a few months ago when the men resolved to let less time go by between reunions. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get together more often,\u201d he recalled them saying to one another. \u201cAnd not just at funerals. \u201d Moments later, the coffin lid was closed and the funeral began.'"}, "time": 1742628458.4900672}
