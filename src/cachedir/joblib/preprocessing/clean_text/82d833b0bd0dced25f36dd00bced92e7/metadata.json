November 3, 2016 Humberto Fontova \\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hillary\u2019s hour!...The only hope of defeating Donald Trump is Hillary Clinton\u2026the difference between the two candidates is vast. Barack Obama did not exaggerate when he claimed that she was better prepared to be a U.S. President than even he was\u2014or was her husband Bill Clinton.\u201d (Stalinist Cuba\u2019s KGB-founded and mentored media organ Cubadebate, Oct. 15, 2016.) \\nThere was a day when winning a ringing endorsement from communist mass-murdering, terror -sponsors who craved (and came within a whisker) of nuking your nation would NOT be considered an asset for a U.S. Presidential candidate. \\n\u201c In any nation of the world\u2013and even in the U.S. during normal times\u2013Donald Trump would find himself either in prison or in a mental institution!\u201d \\nThere was a day when being threatened with prison and torture (even figuratively) by an enemy Stalinist regime that jailed and tortured political prisoners (many of them U.S. citizens) at a higher rate than Stalin during the Great Terror would be considered an enormous asset for a U.S. Presidential candidate. \\nBut the ringing communist endorsement for Hillary Clinton gets even \u201cbetter:\u201d \\n\u201c Hillary Clinton is our only hope of detaining barbarism!\u201d \\nSo warns the eunuch scribe for a totalitarian regime that murdered more Cubans in its first three years in power than Hitler murdered Germans during his first six\u2013 and in the process converted a highly-civilized, immigrant-swamped nation into a slum/sewer with the Hemisphere\u2019s highest suicide rate, which is ravaged by tropical diseases, where tens of thousands have died trying to escape, where alley cats constitute a delicacy and where ox-carts represent luxury transportation. \\n\u201cOn a few occasions Trump has even suggested the assassination of Hillary Clinton!\u201d \\nSo warn the notorious assassins of suddenly inconvenient colleagues ranging from Camilo Cienfuegos to Tony De la Guardia to Manuel \u201cBarbarroja\u2019 Pineiro. Yes, the Castro regime \u201cdevoured its own children\u201d even more voraciously than even Lenin and Stalin\u2019s. \\n\u201cThe news are dominated by revelations\u2014some on video\u2014showing Trump\u2019s obscenity and male chauvinist conduct\u2014along with his treatment of women as sex objects!\u201d \\nSo warns the Stalinist regime that jailed and tortured 35,150 Cuban women for political crimes, a totalitarian horror utterly unknown in the Western Hemisphere until the Castro brothers and Che Guevara took power. Some of these Cuban ladies suffered twice as long in Castro\u2019s Gulag as Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered in Stalin\u2019s. \\nTheir prison conditions were described by former political prisoner Maritza Lugo. \u201cThe punishment cells measure 3 feet wide by 6 feet long. The toilet consists of an 8 inch hole in the ground through which cockroaches and rats enter, especially in cool temperatures the rat come inside to seek the warmth of our bodies and we were often bitten. The suicide rate among women prisoners was very high.\u201d \\nOn Christmas Eve of 1961 a Cuban woman named Juana Diaz Figueroa spat in the face of the executioners who were binding and gagging her. Castro and Che Guevara's KGB-trained secret police had found her guilty of feeding and hiding \u201cbandits\u201d (Cuban rednecks who took up arms to fight the Stalinist theft of their land to build Soviet\u2013style Kolkhozes.) When the blast from Castroite firing squad demolished her face and torso Juana was six months pregnant. \\n\u201cThey started by beating us with twisted coils of electric cable,\u201d recalls former Cuba political prisoner Ezperanza Pena from exile today. \u201cI remember Teresita on the ground with all her lower ribs broken. Gladys had both her arms broken. Doris had her face cut up so badly from the beatings that when she tried to drink, water would pour out of her lacerated cheeks.\u201d \\n\u201cOn Mother\u2019s Day they allowed family visits,\u201d recalls Manuela Calvo from exile today.\u201d But as our mothers and sons and daughters were watching, we were beaten with rubber hoses and high-pressure hoses were turned on us, knocking all of us the ground floor and rolling us around as the guards laughed and our loved-ones screamed helplessly.\u201d \\n\u201cWhen female guards couldn\u2019t handle us male guards were called in for more brutal beatings. I saw teen-aged girls beaten savagely, their bones broken, their mouths bleeding ,\u201d recalls Polita Grau. \\nThousands upon thousands of Cuban women have also drowned, died of thirst or have been eaten alive by sharks attempting to flee the regime founded by the folks who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton. This from a nation formerly richer than half the nations of Europe and deluged by immigrants from same. \\nRemember how Donald Trump was taken greatly to task by the media for not quickly repudiating David Duke\u2019s (so-called) endorsement? \\nWell, we certainly look for the media to take Hillary Clinton similarly to task for not instantly repudiating the endorsement of mass-jailing, mass-torturing, mass-murdering Stalinists. \\nAfter all, recalling the \u201csticks and stones can break my bones\u201d riddle of our childhood, David Duke\u2019s crimes\u201d consist of words (\u201chate-speech.\u201d) Whereas the (literal) sticks, stones--and chains, manacles, bullwhips and bullets--of the fine folks so enthusiastically endorsing Hillary Clinton have caused untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people.\""}, "time": 1742628351.2141924}
