[A group of DACA recipients gathered for a press conference in Connecticut, home to some 8, 500 DACA recipients, to express that they were \u201chere today to let everyone know we\u2019re not going back in the shadows,\u201d as Connecticut Students for a Dream   Camila Bortoletto told WNPR.  \u201cIt\u2019s a different time, it\u2019s a tough time,\u201d Bortoletto said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a scarier time than we\u2019ve had in the past. \u201d Another DACA recipient, Eric Cruz Lopez, complained that some \u2018DREAMers,\u2019 as the mainstream media has dubbed them, are being deported under Trump\u2019s Department of Homeland Security (DHS). \u201cDACA for a lot of undocumented immigrants meant relief, it meant protection, it meant something, it meant a win,\u201d Lopez told the media. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore, right? As we see DACA recipients being picked up, that   relief of deportation doesn\u2019t mean anything to anybody anymore. \u201d Lopez is most likely referring to    Daniel Ramirez Medina, who was a DACA recipient that was most recently arrested by the Immigration and Customs Agency (ICE) agency after they said he is a \u201c  gang member. \u201d As Breitbart Texas reported, the mainstream media covered Medina\u2019s arrest as a plight for other DACA recipients, failing to point out his alleged gang relations across the West Coast. Connecticut\u2019s DACA recipients are now telling others  to not apply for the program until after there is clarity on the issue from the Trump Administration.
