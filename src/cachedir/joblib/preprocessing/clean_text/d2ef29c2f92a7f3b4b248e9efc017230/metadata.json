Wear a hat , especially one that covers up the ears. Baseball caps are fine, but they really focus on the ears \u2013 their shape and proximity to the side of your head \u2013 for identification purposes. The caps also bust up the curvature of your head and also hide the hair and hair patterns. Wear scarves, turtlenecks, and other clothing such as balaclavas to break up the outline of the neck. Gloves : hide the hands, your marital status, and scars, fingernails, or other prominent features\u2026even the fingerprints can be photographed.

Another big problem to overcome with all of this surveillance is the fact that most people have their constantly clicking and snapping little phone-cameras to take pictures of every single thing on the planet within their \u201cbiome,\u201d and it\u2019s these individuals who serve as \u201csilent witnesses\u201d to help the surveillance state gather as much info as they can.
