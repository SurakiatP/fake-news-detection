It is the most beautiful kind of saintly death,\u201d Fadi al Qanbar\u2019s sister Shadia, 28, told Palestinian media.  \u201cAllah chose him for this martyrdom. Thank God. We are patient and we thank Allah for this,\u201d she added. Shadia said her brother was not a member of any terror group and had acted on his own. She added that Qanbar, a father of four, was devoutly religious. Qanbar rammed his truck into a crowd of cadets and officers who were touring the promenade overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem in the southern neighborhood of Armon Hanatziv. According to eyewitnesses, after the terrorist ran his flatbed truck over the soldiers, he reversed over them a second time. All four of the soldiers who died were in their twenties, and three of them were women.   terror group Hamas on Sunday praised the attack as a \u201cheroic\u201d act and encouraged other Palestinians to do the same and \u201cescalate the resistance. \u201d In the coastal enclave, Palestinians were photographed giving out sweets to passing drivers in celebration of the attack. Hamas spokesman   Qanou said the   attack showed that the wave of Palestinian violent \u201cresistance\u201d against Israel has not ceased. \u201cIt may be quiet, it may linger, but it will never end,\u201d he said. At least nine people have been arrested in connection with the attack, mostly members of the Qanbar family. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there are signs Qanbar may have supported the Islamic State. He also suggested a connection between Sunday\u2019s attack and the truck rammings in Berlin and Nice last year.'"}, "time": 1742561931.0169768}
