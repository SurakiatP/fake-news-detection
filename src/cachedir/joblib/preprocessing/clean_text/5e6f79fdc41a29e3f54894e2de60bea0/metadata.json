[I predicted that his campaign would focus on trolling the lazy, entitled Establishment elites the American people hate so much. I predicted this combination of   sass would prove almost impossible for feeble opponents like Jeb Bush to overcome. As always, I was right.  By the way, regular readers of this column will know how much I hate to toot my own horn, but I also predicted Trump would perform well with blacks. Polling shows him at anywhere between 12 and 25 per cent with black voters in a general election   with Clinton. That\u2019s more than double what the GOP normally achieves. Trump\u2019s supporters have treated the campaign as one long trollfest. First Jeb, then Marco and finally Lyin\u2019 Ted all stumbled and fell before the chaotic power of Trump\u2019s troll army. Facing a hilarious combination of   YouTube remixes, and Photoshop mashups, Trump\u2019s opponents were subjected to   ridicule from the cultural powerhouses of the web. The internet made them look stupid. The internet made them look weak. And what begins on    and leaks out into Twitter has a way of colouring media coverage and, ultimately, public perception, even among people who don\u2019t frequent message boards. TV commentators often talk about Trump\u2019s preternatural power to indelibly \u201cbrand\u201d his opponents, from \u201c \u201d Jeb to \u201cLittle\u201d Marco and \u201clying\u201d Ted. No matter how crude and simplistic the labels, they always seems to stick, dumbfounding   political observers who are used to candidates competing for the \u201chigh road. \u201d The strategy of GOP bigwigs appears to be: \u201close badly, but remain virtuous. \u201d The power of Trump\u2019s branding is partly down to the media\u2019s hunger for drama, and partly thanks to his business acumen  \u2014   but it\u2019s also in large part due to his internet supporters, who have an uncanny ability to create and popularise cultural tropes. Or, as we on the internet have come to know them, memes. Part of this involves taking Trump\u2019s campaign victories, his slogans, and his \u201cbrands\u201d and using the power of the web to amplify them. Trump\u2019s repeated humiliations of Jeb Bush were overlaid online with Sad Romance, an    tragic violin tune that was already a web meme. \u201cLittle\u201d Marco, of course, like another   but diminutive conservative figure, was repeatedly photoshopped to make him look like a dwarf.  Meanwhile, YouTube sensation \u201cCan\u2019t Stump The Trump\u201d (whose name, naturally, was a nod to an   Trump meme) has attracted more than 5 million views on YouTube just by remixing Trump\u2019s debate performances, adding air horn noises whenever the candidate scores a particularly effective zinger. Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d has also been seized upon by the internet. Countless jokes, GIFs and videos can now be found around the web dedicated solely to the    Great Wall of Trump. This meme has gone so viral, it still gets the biggest cheers at Trump rallies. Establishment types no doubt think this is all silly, schoolyard stuff. And it is. But it\u2019s also effective. And it\u2019s not just effective with the young \u2018uns, either. Older generations may not be as   as millennials, but it doesn\u2019t take them long to catch on. One of our staffers\u2019   old parents enjoyed Can\u2019t Stump The Trump so much that they watched five of the videos   . Meme propaganda is funny, memorable, persuasive  \u2014   and it works. Still, the Establishment doesn\u2019t care. They\u2019d rather take the high road and lose than go down in the dirt and win. Well, they\u2019re getting what they wanted! Trump\u2019s internet army did more than just riff on his media performances, of course. The relationship between the candidate and his mischievous internet brigade is deeply symbiotic. As well as reacting to Trump and the campaign, the internet has created and popularised its own memes, sometimes out of thin air. Take the hilarious, infamous comparison of Ted Cruz to the Zodiac Killer. Although it was started by a progressive on Twitter, it was popularised by Trump supporters. Before long, the meme made its way out of obscure internet communities and into the national media. It got so bad that Heidi Cruz actually had to respond to the rumour, telling voters a day before the Indiana primary that \u201cmy husband is not the Zodiac Killer!\u201d In another case of a meme reaching the real world, during his victory speech in Indiana, Trump himself referenced the \u201cTrump Train\u201d  \u2014   a meme that had been created and popularised by the internet. For web trolls, having one of their pranks garner national attention is the Holy Grail. They call it \u201cmeme magic\u201d  \u2014   when   web memes become so influential they start to affect   events. Trump\u2019s candidacy affords the internet the ability to do so virtually every day. No wonder they love him. Other memes are out there just for the fun of it, but they still help to cement Trump\u2019s reputation as an engine of chaos. There are depictions of Trump as the \u201cGod Emperor\u201d of Warhammer: 40, 000 mythology. There are depictions of Trump as Pepe the Frog, one of the  \u2019s most popular memes. The internet had a minor heart attack when Trump retweeted one such depiction from his Twitter account  \u2014   along with a link to a Can\u2019t Stump The Trump video. \u201d@codyave:  @drudgereport @BreitbartNews @Writeintrump \u201dYou Can\u2019t Stump the Trump\u201d https:  .  pic. twitter. \u201d  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2015,  The mirthful, prankish nature of Trump\u2019s young supporters was revealed again in the closing hours of Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign, when Cruz made the mistake of trying to engage them directly. The university debate champ no doubt expected to have a heated, but ultimately      with Trump\u2019s supporters. But they were playing an entirely different game. He received a stream of memes and ridicule instead. Arguing with   denizens of Twitter and internet forums is almost always a losing proposition, as Cruz would know if there were anyone on his campaign team who understood the culture. . @tedcruz crosses the street to confront @realDonaldTrump backers on the sidewalk https:  .   \u2014   Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) May 3, 2016,  Elsewhere, a Bernie supporter  \u2014   another constituency which enjoys a particularly young and effective web presence  \u2014   offered Cruz a handshake before rapidly withdrawing it and yelling that the candidate \u201clooks like a fish monster. \u201d Juvenile? Yes. But the kids know this stuff will go viral. The press laps it up. And voters at home don\u2019t want to associate with candidates who keep showing up as the butt of the joke. WATCH: Protester fakes out Ted Cruz with handshake, tells him he looks like a fish monster: https:  .  https:  .   \u2014   Good Morning America (@GMA) May 3, 2016,  Before he bombed out, Cruz tried to tread into meme territory himself with a cringeworthy video of Simpsons impressions. It might have scored points with young voters, oh, say 15 years ago.  It didn\u2019t work. Cruz, bless him, was so terminally unhip that he fed the Trump meme brigades on a daily basis. While not as   as the disastrous Jeb, he certainly wasn\u2019t Mr. Smooth. From not helping Carly Fiorina up after her fall on a campaign stop in Indiana, to accidentally elbowing his wife in the face twice after his concession speech, there was always something awkward about the oleaginous Cruz. There are some people who are at one with the web, and Cruz wasn\u2019t one of them. I knew little of meme culture before 2014, but after we discovered each other, it wasn\u2019t long before I became a walking, living, breathing meme myself. I don\u2019t know if Donald Trump spends time thinking about 4chan, but he has a character and a style that is perfectly in tune with what the web\u2019s miscreants are looking for. And it\u2019s clear from his Twitter account and speeches that he knows what\u2019s going on and enjoys it. Among the Republican field, Trump was the only candidate who enjoyed a base of support that was truly  . He combined Ron Paul\u2019s strange ability to mobilise the internet\u2019s meme brigades with an unstumpable media profile. Caught between the hammer of Trump\u2019s media machine and the anvil of his online troll army, The Donald\u2019s opponents never stood a chance. Trump understands the internet, and the internet might just propel him into the White House. Meme magic is real. Follow Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) on Twitter and Facebook.
