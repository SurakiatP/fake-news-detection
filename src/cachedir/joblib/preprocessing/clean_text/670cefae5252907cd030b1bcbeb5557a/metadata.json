But as the death knell sounds for his campaign, he still isn\u2019t changing his miserly ways. New reports indicate that Trump graciously allowed the Palm Beach Boys & Girls Club to hold a fundraiser at the Trump International Golf Course in Florida \u2013 and then charged them $20,000 for the favor. \\n\u201cThis \u2018free\u2019 event is costing us $20,000 between golf and catering fees. What we had hoped for as far as a \u2018net\u2019 income for this event has been cut in half (if we are lucky)\u201d complained Mark Casale, vice president of philanthropy for the Boys and Girls Clubs. \\nThe course usually charges around $5,000 and leaves the county off the hook for the rest, but not this time. The annual charitable tournament goes to a different organization every year; it just so happens that this year\u2019s choice was made by District 6 commissioner Melissa McKinlay \u2013 who is a Democrat. \\n\u201cNone of this was disclosed to me when given the choice to select a charity. I was under the impression the charity was able to host the event without any charges. Explain to me how this is supposed to be a benefit to the county?\u201d demanded McKinlay in an email. \u201cIf I were the Boys & Girls Club, I would pull out. How are smaller charities supposed to be able to afford this? This has placed me and the charity in a very bad position and I am quite upset by it.\u201d \\nNeither the Trump International Golf Course nor the Trump campaign have responded to requests for comment. \\nWashington Post reporter David Farenthold has undertaken a minutely detailed investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s charitable past \u2013 and found that he has donated far less than he claims to have give n. Most of the money Trump has \u201cdonated\u201d was donated to the Trump Foundation by other donors; many charities \u2013 including those belonging to veterans\u2019 organizations \u2013 were promised donations that were never paid out . It\u2019s been discovered that the \u201cTrump Foundation\u201d was never properly certified to solicit donations in the first place, and Farenthold\u2019s research shows that Trump has been using his \u201ccharitable foundation\u201d to launder money through to evade millions in taxes. Trump would charge a starving person for the scraps from his table; he has not a charitable bone in his body. His selfishness is legendary, and we cannot elect such a morally deficient man to the Presidency.'"}, "time": 1742563473.5078862}
