The project, the most ambitious the federal government has undertaken in tracking the use of force by police officers, is meant to fill what officials say is a huge and frustrating void in publicly available data on the shootings that have roiled the country. Under the plan, the Justice Department will gather more data on the use of force by federal agents and help local departments report information on a wider range of police encounters. But a number of the reporting steps will rely on local police officials to voluntarily submit data, and some civil rights advocates said the Justice Department had not made clear how it would impose financial penalties set by Congress to encourage the reporting of police shootings. \u201cI can\u2019t believe two years into this crisis that we\u2019re still having conversations about data,\u201d said Kanya Bennett, a lawyer in Washington for the American Civil Liberties Union, which met with the Justice Department to discuss the plan. With President Obama leaving office in three months, Ms. Bennett said, \u201cthis is essentially being punted to the next administration. \u201d After a series of fatal encounters in places like Ferguson, Mo. Charlotte, N. C. Tulsa, Okla. Baton Rouge, La. Cleveland Milwaukee Baltimore and Staten Island  \u2014   many involving unarmed black men and caught on video  \u2014   officials have struggled to gather basic information about how often such episodes occur and what can be done. The most comprehensive records on police shootings have come from the news media, particularly The Washington Post and The Guardian, which have created running databases. James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. told lawmakers last year that it was \u201cembarrassing\u201d that the news media could produce better data than his own agency on such an important issue. \u201cWe can\u2019t have an informed discussion because we don\u2019t have data,\u201d Mr. Comey told the House Judiciary Committee last October. \u201cPeople have data about who went to a movie last weekend, or how many books were sold, or how many cases of the flu walked into the emergency room,\u201d he said, \u201cand I cannot tell you how many people were shot by police in the United States last month, last year, or anything about the demographic. And that\u2019s a very bad place to be. \u201d According to the Post database, 991 people were fatally shot by the police last year, and 754 have been so far this year. Under the Justice Department plan, the F. B. I. is to begin a pilot program early next year to assemble data on the use of force by about 178, 000 agents at major federal law enforcement agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Marshals Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the F. B. I. itself. In addition, the Justice Department plans to begin collecting data from local and state law enforcement departments on \u201cin custody\u201d deaths  \u2014   not just in shootings, but in cases of suicide and natural death as well. A measure passed by Congress in 2014 called the Death in Custody Reporting Act required local departments to report only fatal encounters. Justice Department officials said they would rely on local police officials to voluntarily report nonlethal encounters as well. Under a third part of the plan, the Justice Department said it was authorizing $750, 000 for a \u201cpolice data initiative\u201d designed to help local departments collect and publicly release information on a wider range of actions, including stops of citizens, searches, the use of force, shootings and other encounters. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said in announcing the plan Thursday that comprehensive and accurate data on police encounters was essential in \u201cincreasing transparency and building trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve. \u201d Lacking better data has made it \u201cvery, very hard\u201d to determine the causes of police shootings, or even whether there was an actual increase in such episodes or simply more publicity about them, Ms. Lynch said at an event Thursday night at Georgetown University. The law passed by Congress in 2014 for reporting   deaths allows the attorney general to impose financial penalties on states that do not report data. But Ms. Bennett, the A. C. L. U. lawyer, faulted the Justice Department for failing to explain how that would happen under the new plan. In a letter to the Justice Department last week, the A. C. L. U. and 95 other groups pushing for greater accountability in police shootings wrote that imposing financial penalties was critical to the success of the program. In the past, the letter said, \u201cvoluntary reporting programs on   encounters have failed. \u201d The steps announced by the Justice Department grew out of a presidential commission appointed by Mr. Obama in 2014 to study ways of reducing conflict and tensions between police departments and the communities they serve. Announcing a series of recommendations from the commission in March 2015, Mr. Obama said that the country needed to seize the opportunity to \u201ctransform\u201d   relations. \u201cWe have a great opportunity, coming out of some great conflict and tragedy, so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel, rather than being embattled, feel fully supported,\u201d he said,'"}, "time": 1742562713.4618955}
