It also disproves the Treasury\u2019s referendum campaign claim that a vote to leave the EU would r esult in 0.1pc fall in GDP in the third quarter that would herald the start of a recession. The Treasury\u2019s worst-case \u201csevere shock\u201d scenario was even more pessimistic, predicting a 1pc fall in the three-month period. \\nS terling rallied on the initial estimates from the Office for National Statistics, and economists said the unexpectedly strong numbers made it less likely that the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) would cut interest rates at next month\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting.
