A ruling by the court could clarify one of the most hotly debated issues on Wall Street: what prosecutors must prove to secure insider trading convictions based on confidential tips. In their questioning, the justices grappled with where to draw the line. Even as they appeared sympathetic to the government\u2019s interpretation of the high court\u2019s past insider trading decisions, the justices were wary of radically expanding the government\u2019s power and affording prosecutors too much of a free hand in these cases. The case now before the court, Salman v. United States, No.   comes from California and centers on the insider trading conviction of Bassam Salman in 2013. According to prosecutors, Mr. Salman placed profitable stock trades based on confidential information leaked by his future    Maher Kara, who had advance knowledge of corporate mergers because of his job in Citigroup\u2019s health care investment banking group. For decades, courts have held that it is not inherently illegal to trade stocks based on material, nonpublic information like a merger or acquisition. For an insider to be guilty of sharing inside information, his leak must breach a duty to keep the information confidential and he must receive a personal benefit in exchange for the leak. By extension, the person who receives the information must generally know of that breach and benefit. The Salman case presents a question that has vexed federal appeals courts and left prosecutors and traders alike seeking clarity: What exactly amounts to a \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d? Prosecutors hope the court will afford them leeway in defining the benefit, arguing that if an insider provides a gift of information, that should count as a benefit. In the Salman case, Maher Kara did not receive any financial benefit, but arguably leaked the information as a gift. Mr. Salman\u2019s lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, argued on Wednesday that the benefit must be more \u201ctangible\u201d  \u2014   like cash or something that eventually can be monetized. Several of the justices, citing one of the court\u2019s seminal insider trading decisions from three decades ago, seemed skeptical of her argument and poised to uphold Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction. After all, as Justice Stephen Breyer noted, \u201cto help a close family member is like helping yourself. \u201d Yet the court, often skeptical of prosecutors in   crime cases, also questioned the government\u2019s lawyer, Michael Dreeben, about where to draw the line. The justices seemed hesitant to afford prosecutors broad authority to apply the   gift test to situations in which the insider and recipient are not family or close friends. The issue gained prominence after a 2014 decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, United States v. Newman, that upended the Justice Department\u2019s sweeping crackdown on insider trading. Mr. Salman\u2019s argument for overturning his conviction hinges on the Newman decision, which tightened the standard for what constitutes a personal benefit by requiring prosecutors to show a tangible benefit rather than mere friendship between the tipper and recipient. The Second Circuit, in that 2014 decision, overturned the insider trading convictions of the hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, who were at the end of a long chain of information being passed along. In the aftermath, federal prosecutors in New York tossed out the convictions of nearly a dozen other traders and industry consultants. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office secured insider trading convictions against dozens of people in the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund industry, has been an outspoken critic of the Second Circuit ruling. Mr. Bharara, who attended Wednesday\u2019s argument, has argued that the Second Circuit\u2019s decision could create \u201ca potential bonanza for friends and family of rich people with material nonpublic information. \u201d The Supreme Court denied the Justice Department\u2019s request that it review that ruling, though the justices could indirectly rebuke it in deciding Mr. Salman\u2019s case. In Mr. Salman\u2019s case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco took a different approach. The Ninth Circuit upheld Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction and adopted the view that giving inside information to a family member qualified as a benefit, creating what some legal observers saw as a split that only the Supreme Court could reconcile. Both the Newman and Salman appeals court decisions hinged on a    Supreme Court case, Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission, that has long been the cornerstone of insider trading law. That decision directed courts to focus on \u201cwhether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure, such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings. \u201d In overturning Mr. Newman\u2019s conviction, the Second Circuit seized on that financial element. But when the Ninth Circuit upheld Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction, it focused on another passage in the Dirks decision that allowed liability \u201cwhen an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend. \u201d That excerpt strikes at the heart of Mr. Salman\u2019s case. Maher Kara passed the inside information, arguably as a gift, to his brother, Michael Kara, who in turn shared it with Mr. Salman. The two families were close Maher Kara was engaged to Mr. Salman\u2019s sister. (While Maher Kara struck a plea deal and was sentenced to three months of home confinement, Mr. Salman was sentenced to three years in prison.) Some of the justices, appearing skeptical of Mr. Salman\u2019s argument, highlighted the passage within the Dirks ruling that references gifts to family members. \u201cYou\u2019re asking us to cut back significantly from something that we said several decades ago,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan told Ms. Shapiro, adding that \u201cthe integrity of the markets are a very important thing for this country. And you\u2019re asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that threatens that integrity. \u201d But a decision that just upholds Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction  \u2014   and reaffirms the Dirks decision with some clarity  \u2014   would disappoint some prosecutors who argue that the current unsettled nature of the law has had a chilling effect on cases. The Justice Department\u2019s ideal ruling would uphold the conviction of Mr. Salman and then take the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling further so that the gift rule would not be limited to just family and close friends. Mr. Dreeben mentioned the case of a barber who could slip through the cracks. He also proposed an even looser standard that would allow charges whenever information is shared for a noncorporate purpose and the insider knows that the recipient will place trades based on the leak. The justices appeared to balk at that extension of prosecutorial power. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me that your argument is much more consistent with Dirks than Ms. Shapiro\u2019s,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito told Mr. Dreeben. Justice Alito then proposed a hypothetical: \u201cNow suppose someone, the insider is walking down the street and sees someone who has a really unhappy look on his face and says, I want to do something to make this person\u2019s day. And so he provides the inside information\u201d and allows the recipient to trade. Mr. Dreeben replied that such a case was indeed a violation. Later in the argument, however, as other justices expressed skepticism about the Justice Department\u2019s position, Mr. Dreeben conceded that \u201cif the court feels more comfortable given the facts of this case of reaffirming Dirks and saying that was the law in 1983, it remains the law today, that is completely fine with the government. \u201d Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and now a professor at Columbia Law School, predicted that because insider trading law was almost entirely   rather than set by Congress, the Supreme Court might be reluctant to radically revisit its Dirks ruling from three decades ago. It would be simpler to draw distinctions between cases involving family members and business associates. \u201cIf you were going to be a minimalist, this little bit of family relationship could be elaborated on without wholesale redevelopment,\u201d he said. One of the most prominent critics of judges determining what constitutes insider trading was Justice Antonin Scalia, whose death earlier this year created the vacancy on the bench. Justice Scalia argued that only Congress  \u2014   rather than agencies, prosecutors or judges  \u2014   may define what conduct amounts to insider trading. Although Ms. Shapiro made a similar argument, the remaining eight justices seemed to be unswayed. They also seemed skeptical of her argument that Maher Kara turned over the information to Michael Kara for \u201cthe scant benefit of getting his brother off his back. \u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom Ms. Shapiro was once a law clerk, remarked: \u201cHe\u2019s no longer being pestered. Isn\u2019t that a benefit?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564399.4543138}
