Well here\u2019s your \u201cintent\u201d thanks to Wikileaks.\\nThe email, which may indicate intent, was sent at the same time as the NYT story \u201c Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules \u201d \u2013 which for the first time revealed the existence of Hillary\u2019s email server \u2013 hit, and just days before Hillary\u2019s press conference addressing what was at the time, the stunning revelation that she had a personal email account, and server, in her home.\\nThe proposed \u201cdumping\u201d on March 2 takes place two days before the House Select Committee on Benghazi sent Hillary Clinton a document retention subpoena on March 4, 2015, with some hinting the NYT report may have served to tip off the Clinton campaign about the upcoming subpoena.\\nMills\u2019 response to Podesta: \u201cThink you just got your new nick name.\u201d\\nIt is unclear which \u201cLanny\u201d is referred to: the infamous former DOJ staffer Lanny Breuer who quit in January 2013 after telling Frontline that some banks are too big to fail, or, more likely Lanny Davis, special counsel to President Bill Clinton, and spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues\\nIt is also unclear \u2013 for now \u2013 which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread, but Podesta adds: \u201cbetter to do so sooner than later.\u201d We can hope that a subsequent response, yet to be leaked by Wikileaks, will provide more color.\\nIf the exchange is shown to disclose intent to mislead, it will negate the entire narrative prepared by Clinton that she merely deleted \u201cpersonal\u201d emails and will reveal a strategic plan to hinder the State Department and FBI \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\\nThis is the first time that particular exchange has emerged among the Podesta emails.\\nFurthermore, a search for Lanny Davis reveals the following curious exchange between Robby Mook and John Podesta from March 8, 2015, just days after the abovementioned exchange, in which Mook says:\\nWe gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can\u2019t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.\\nIt seems the Clinton campaign was not happy with being set on a course of transparency by Bill Clinton\u2019s special counsel.\\nFinally, in a separate email sent out in the first week of March 2015 , by Clinton campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, we get yet another confirmation that the president actively mislead the public when he said he didn\u2019t know Hillary was using a private email address:\\nSuggest Philippe talk to Josh or Eric. They know POTUS and HRC emailed. Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet\u2019s email addresses.\\nPerhaps while the DOJ/FBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedin\u2019s emails, it can also take a repeat look at some of these, especially the ones involving POTUS.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742563594.1732292}
