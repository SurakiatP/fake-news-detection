Trump. In its final episode of 2016, \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d the sketch series and enduring thorn in Mr. Trump\u2019s side, began with a cold open on Saturday that went hard at some sensitive spots for the  : his relationship to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, his courtship of Melania Trump, and some of his recent gaffes and cabinet nominations. The show all but dared Mr. Trump to respond on his Twitter account, but he did not immediately do so. The opening sketch once again featured Alec Baldwin as Mr. Trump and Kate McKinnon as his senior adviser Kellyanne Conway. It began with him revealing that he had chosen Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, to be secretary of energy after seeing him on \u201cDancing With the Stars. \u201d \u201cThis guy has so much energy,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said as Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s just unpresidented. \u201d (The malapropism was a reference to a tweet Mr. Trump had posted on Saturday morning, in which he wrote \u201cunpresidented,\u201d which he then deleted and replaced with the correct word, \u201cunprecedented. \u201d) A   Mr. Putin (played by the \u201cS. N. L. \u201d cast member Beck Bennett) soon came down the chimney with a Santa sack. He profusely flattered Mr. Trump as \u201cthe best candidate\u201d and \u201cthe smartest candidate\u201d  \u2014   and \u201cthe Manchurian candidate,\u201d implying Mr. Trump was an unwitting Russian puppet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means, but it sounds tremendous,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Putin then gave Mr. Trump an \u201cElf on the Shelf\u201d toy  \u2014   and instructed him to keep it next to his internet router all year long. \u201cVladimir, I\u2019m sorry, but I didn\u2019t know you were coming, so I do not have a gift for you,\u201d the Trump character said. \u201cPlease, Mr. Trump, you are the gift,\u201d the Russian leader replied. Mrs. Trump (played by Cecily Strong) interrupted to express concern that Mr. Putin and her husband were becoming too cozy. \u201cIf a person you did not know came from a foreign country and just started flattering you, what would you do?\u201d she asked. Mr. Baldwin\u2019s Trump responded, \u201cMarry them. \u201d (Mrs. Trump was born in Slovenia.) Appearing moments later was Rex W. Tillerson (John Goodman, the frequent \u201cS. N. L. \u201d host and guest star) the chief executive of Exxon Mobil and Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state. He quickly huddled with Mr. Putin to review some plans for oil drilling, excluding Mr. Trump from their discussions. \u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d the   said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Mr. Putin said dismissively. Still, Mr. Baldwin\u2019s Trump tried to inject himself into the conversation. \u201cAnd then we destroy Vanity Fair, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cSpeaking of black and crude, I know Kanye,\u201d a reference to his   meeting with Kanye West last week. Mr. Trump, who hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in November 2015 while still vying for the Republican presidential nomination, has lashed out at the program in recent weeks amid its steady caricatures of him. In Twitter posts, he has called it a \u201cboring and unfunny show\u201d and said that Mr. Baldwin\u2019s portrayal of him \u201cstinks. \u201d During the show\u2019s Dec. 3 broadcast, which began with a sketch that satirized his Twitter habit, Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201cJust tried watching Saturday Night Live  \u2014   unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can\u2019t get any worse. Sad\u201d Later that week, in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, Mr. Trump expanded on his criticism. \u201cI hosted \u2018S. N. L.\u2019 when it was a good show, but it\u2019s not a good show anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing to do with me, there\u2019s nothing funny about it. The skits are terrible. \u201d He added that he liked Mr. Baldwin but \u201chis imitation of me is really meanspirited and not very good. \u201d Earlier on Saturday, Mr. Baldwin let it be known that he would be returning to \u201cS. N. L. \u201d to mock Mr. Trump, tweeting a photo of himself in his Trump hair and makeup, as well as a tweet that said, \u201cI won\u2019t  \u201d (like \u201cunpresidented,\u201d another   malapropism that Mr. Baldwin has previously used when playing the character.) Lorne Michaels, the creator and executive producer of \u201cS. N. L. ,\u201d has not directly addressed Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms. In a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine, Mr. Michaels said he believes the show speaks to a wide range of political affiliations. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually tried to make \u2018S. N. L.\u2019 a safe space across the political spectrum,\u201d Mr. Michaels said. As of early Sunday, Mr. Trump had not tweeted about the latest \u201cS. N. L. \u201d episode.'"}, "time": 1742562994.6644979}
