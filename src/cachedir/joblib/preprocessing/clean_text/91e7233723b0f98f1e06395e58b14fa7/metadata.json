Oh and he also said that wanting to make American great again was racist. \\nThe Daily Beast published an interview with Hawke, gracing us with the musings of a man who should stick to memorizing the lines that someone else wrote for him. Then again, that\u2019s what he did, he spewed liberal talking points. This is also known as the \u201cstuff people incapable of higher level thinking\u201d say in interviews to get attention. \\n\u201cWhen you see a man, if he wins, threatening to put his opponent in jail?\u201d Hawke said in reference to Donald Trump promising that he would hold Clinton accountable for breaking the law. \u201cThat\u2019s fascist behavior.\u201d \\nYeah, you guys (oops, I forgot that\u2019s sexist but fortunately I also just remembered that I don\u2019t care). Anyway, Hawke may not understand how the law works, but it\u2019s pretty simple, even for him. If you break a law, consequences are supposed to follow. \\nFor most of us, there are consequences, but Clinton has been held to a different set of standards than the rest of us. Just ask retired 4-star Gen. James Cartwright how that works \u2014 he\u2019s facing jail time and a fine for doing something quite similar to Clinton yet she\u2019s still running for president. \\nLet\u2019s take a gander at the definition of Fascism from Dictionary.com : \\nnoun \\n1. \\n( sometimes initial capital letter ) a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism. \\nAll you have to do is swap out \u201cnationalism\u201d for \u201cglobalism\u201d and that definition fits Clinton like a glove. Complete power, suppression of free speech, control of the economy, globalism, and racism are Clinton\u2019s platform. \\nLiberals like to throw the word fascism around because they think it makes them sound smart, but far more often than not the fascist label is much more befitting of the liberal candidate than the conservative, and in this case especially, it is a fine example of what a Clinton presidency would look like. \\nHawke also called Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again, racist in the interview. \u201cWhat \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 means is not lost on any of us,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt means \u2018white\u2019 and \u2018male.'\u201d \\nIs that what it meant when former President Bill Clinton used it during his wife\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign? If so, boy, that makes things awkward, doesn\u2019t it? Slick Willy also used the phrase back in 1992 during his own campaign.\""}, "time": 1742563640.8259776}
