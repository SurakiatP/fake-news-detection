It is expected to take a week or so for congressional investigators to assess these materials.  The NSA material is said to be even more compelling than the evidence that prompted committee chairman Devin Nunes ( ) to announce on Wednesday that \u201cincidental\u201d surveillance of the Trump transition team was conducted by the intelligence community. Rosen\u2019s report has a few more interesting developments in the aftermath of Nunes\u2019 announcement: Because Nunes\u2019s intelligence came from multiple sources during a span of several weeks, and he has not shared the actual materials with his committee colleagues, he will be the only member of the panel in a position to know whether the NSA has turned over some or all of the intelligence he is citing. However, Fox News was told Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Rep. Adam Schiff,  . had been briefed on the basic contents of the intelligence described by Nunes. CIA Director Mike Pompeo is also sympathetic to the effort to determine, with documentary evidence, the extent of any alleged Obama administration spying on the Trump team, sources said. Because so much criticism has been leveled at the media for basing reports hostile to the Trump administration on anonymous sources of uncertain motivation, it should be duly noted that the Fox News report relies heavily upon a single source, without a single clue to this person\u2019s identity or position. It\u2019s not clear if this individual is connected to the intelligence community, or to the House Intelligence Committee. The nature of the NSA\u2019s \u201csmoking gun\u201d information is also left to the reader\u2019s imagination. In fact, it\u2019s described as \u201cpotential smoking gun\u201d information. It should also be noted that on Thursday, a spokesperson for Nunes said the chairman is waiting to see \u201call the documents he requested\u201d from intelligence agencies before he \u201cknows for sure\u201d what surveillance of the transition team or   Trump was conducted. Perhaps the material coming from the NSA will positively establish which, if any, Trump transition team members were caught up in the \u201cincidental surveillance\u201d Nunes described on Wednesday. An unnamed intelligence official speculated to ABC News that surveillance on foreign officials might have caught them \u201ctalking about Trump transition team members, as opposed to transition team members participating directly in the communications. \u201d The NSA would seem to be the agency most likely to possess documentation resolving that question.'"}, "time": 1742564221.7774556}
