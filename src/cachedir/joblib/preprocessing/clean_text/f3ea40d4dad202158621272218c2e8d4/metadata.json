[\u201cThe issue of voting fraud often gets politicized, and people are making statements with few foundations [of fact, so] this commission will provide a firm foundation [of] information and facts that are verifiable about the issues surrounding voter fraud,\u201d said Kobach, who is the Kansas Secretary of State and is a   opponent of voters fraud and illegal immigration.   \u201cThe states are in the drivers\u2019 seat, but this commission can offer recommendations and evidence\u201d for state legislators to debate, he added, adding that many state elections are decided by fewer than 50 votes.  Koch is   of the panel, which is run by Vice President Mike Pence. The panel is expected to include Democrats, but progressive pressure groups are calling for a Democratic boycott.  The commission is vital because it can use federal data about peoples\u2019 citizenship to help states check the eligibility of people on their voting rolls, Kobach said. \u201cThe federal government has a database of all known   residing in or visiting the United States   \u2026     never before has that database been used to run [checks] against the databases of voter rolls in each state,\u201d he said.  Some states have asked for federal data to check their   but \u201cwe\u2019ve always been turned down\u201d by the federal government, said Kobach. Election watchers in several states, including Texas and Virginia, have concerns about ineligible voters on their rolls, he said.  In part, vote fraud is important because \u201cclose races happen all the time,\u201d he said, adding that Kansas has had more than 20 elections for federal or state seats over the last 20 years which were decided by fewer than 50 votes. \u201cThat\u2019s true all across the country,\u201d he said, adding that the panel won\u2019t be looking back at prior elections.  Voter fraud is a moral issue, said Kobach. \u201cThere\u2019s a broader principle  \u2014   every time  there is a fraudulent vote, it effectively cancels out a legitimately cast vote by the U. S. citizen. \u201d But the new bipartisan commission is already being scorched by the Democrats\u2019   coalition, including the ACLU, which is pressuring Democrats to boycott the bipartisan panel.  \u201cAs President Trump\u2019s own lawyers have said, \u2018All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,\u2019\u201d said a statement from Dale Ho, director of the ACLU\u2019s voting rights office. He continued: This commission, to be   by King of Voter Suppression Kris Kobach, is a sham. We call on professional elections administrators, serious academics, and elected officials to refuse to participate in what will be a pretext for disenfranchising Americans. Ho also urged voting rules be loosened to encourage higher election turnout, saying \u201cthe United States has one of the lowest turnout rates in the developed world, and we should be doing everything we can to encourage more people, not fewer, to participate in our democracy. \u201d Kobach\u2019s   measures in Kansas have prompted angry criticism and lawsuits from progressive groups. For example, the ACLU is suing Kobach\u2019s office to detail his   measures, including a requirement that people prove their citizenship when registering to vote, and show identification when voting. Those   measures have improperly pushed 30, 000 people off the voting rolls, and have halted registration by an additional 35, 000 people, claims the ACLU. Chris Carson, the national president of the League of Women Voters, told the Kansas City Star that the commission is \u201cpart of a wider effort to suppress the vote, keep certain politicians in power, and undermine our elections by spreading falsehoods. \u201d The Democrats\u2019 hostility to Kobach is offset by praise from other lawyers. \u201cI\u2019ve had the pleasure to debate him on voting issues and have found that he is a knowledgeable and engaging advocate,\u201d said Mark Johnson, a Kanas City attorney who is leading a lawsuit to overturn Kobach\u2019s   rules. \u201cKobach is an honorable public servant and as such, I hope he will put aside any personal beliefs and participate in the investigation with an open mind. \u201d The commission\u2019s \u201cjob is to look at the problem, collect data, and see where the facts are and make some recommendations,\u201d said Kobach. Only legislators in the states have the power to change or preserve their voting systems, he said, because \u201celections are under the control of the states [according to] the constitution. \u201d '"}, "time": 1742563120.154659}
