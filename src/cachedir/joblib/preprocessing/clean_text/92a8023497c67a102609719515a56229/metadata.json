Senators nod politely at his false claims of mass voter fraud during private White House meetings. The congressional morning briefing literature now includes a rundown of overnight and   social media missives from the commander in chief. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take that long to read \u2019em,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. After three weeks in the White House, Mr. Trump has made clear that he is going to continue promulgating conspiracy theories, flinging personal insults and saying things that are plainly untrue. And the   House and Senate seem to have made a collective decision: They will accommodate  \u2014   not confront  \u2014   his conduct as long as he signs their   conservative proposals on taxes, regulations and health care into law. \u201cThere\u2019s a widely held view among our members that, yes, he\u2019s going to say things on a daily basis that we\u2019re not going to like,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the   Senate Republican, \u201cbut that the broad legislative agenda and goals that we have  \u2014   if we can stay focused on those and try and get that stuff enacted  \u2014   those would be big wins. \u201d Such accommodation is coming at a price, attracting incredulous or angry constituents to town hall meetings, leaving members   when presented with the latest presidential provocation and testing the capacity of now perpetually clogged phone lines on Capitol Hill. Some of this would have happened under any Republican president  \u2014   lawmakers were quick to note the ferocity of protests under President George W. Bush. But much of it is unique to Mr. Trump, whose rampaging presidency has spurred uncommon civic engagement even in   districts. \u201cWhat is your line in the sand?\u201d a retired Utah teacher demanded last week of Representative Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who slogged through a   forum back home. But at least for now, that is a price Republicans seem willing to pay. In effect, congressional Republicans have sought to compartmentalize Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, adopting a   approach. They reach for the more appealing offerings, such as the Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, and avert their gaze from less appetizing or, to some, downright indefensible elements (America is not so different from Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia) which would have surely drawn relentless rebukes if uttered by President Barack Obama. Some lawmakers take comfort knowing that the president\u2019s behavior last year didn\u2019t hurt their campaigns, and they have used the electoral result as a justification unto itself, suggesting  \u2014   as Mr. Trump has constantly  \u2014   that his campaign success validates his approach. \u201cHe\u2019s a unique personality, to be sure,\u201d acknowledged Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip. \u201cBut he\u2019s gotten this far the way he is, and I think that probably leads him to think, well, it\u2019s working for him so far, so why change?\u201d And Republican lawmakers do not mind? \u201cAs long as we\u2019re able to get things done,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. Individual Republican senators have criticized the president in mostly isolated cases, none more vocally than Senator John McCain of Arizona, who blasted the president\u2019s comparison between Mr. Putin\u2019s extrajudicial killings and American conduct, and recently expressed concerns about a military raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of an American commando and multiple civilians. Often, the president has taken note  \u2014   in brushback pitches that serve as warnings, if not to Mr. McCain, then to lawmakers who might emulate him. \u201cHe\u2019s been losing so long he doesn\u2019t know how to win anymore,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote of Mr. McCain on Twitter on Thursday morning, calling to mind Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion during the campaign that Mr. McCain was not a war hero because he had been captured in combat. Hours later, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, went to the Senate floor and lamented the attacks on Mr. McCain and other Republicans. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, then followed  \u2014   and seemed far less bothered. \u201cI personally wish he would choose his words a little more carefully,\u201d Mr. Hatch said of the president. \u201cOn the other hand, I kind of find him refreshing, that he doesn\u2019t take any guff from anybody. \u201d Privately, lawmakers and members of their staffs have pleaded with Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle for more discipline from the president and his White House. \u201cWe might talk to the vice president, but certainly not for public attribution,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said of Vice President Mike Pence, who joins Senate Republicans once a week at their regular luncheons in the Capitol. By and large, though, Republicans in Congress are treating Mr. Trump as an individual to be worked around in his own administration. \u201cI think we can get a lot done with the people around him,\u201d Mr. McCain said, dismissing policy pronouncements from Mr. Trump that often differ from \u201cthe day before. \u201d Practically patting Mr. Trump on the head, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said, \u201cIf he pays attention to people like General Kelly when he\u2019s doing a travel restriction and if he appoints people like Neil Gorsuch when he\u2019s making appointments, he\u2019ll be rewarded for that by all the praise, and maybe he\u2019ll do more of it. \u201d (Former Gen. John F. Kelly is the Homeland Security secretary.) In hopes of repairing their relationship with Congress after the botched rollout of the travel ban, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have aggressively courted congressional Republicans. In addition to Mr. Pence with his weekly visits, Marc Short, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief legislative liaison, has already become ubiquitous in the Capitol. And powerful senators are enjoying significant attention: Mr. McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman, said he had already had three conversations with Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, and a breakfast with Jim Mattis, the defense secretary. Mr. Hatch, who is chairman of the Finance Committee, had a   meeting with Mr. Trump in the White House. And Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the health and education panel, was invited to the White House last Thursday for lunch with Mr. Trump. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said there was \u201ca high level of satisfaction\u201d with the new White House, insisting that members cared little about \u201cthe daily tweets. \u201d The deflection is bicameral. When a reporter recently noted that the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, had often declined to weigh in on the \u201ctweet of the day,\u201d Mr. Ryan lit up. \u201cYou got my talking points down already!\u201d he said, before gently fielding a question about Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the federal judge who halted his travel ban. \u201cLook, he\u2019s not the first president to get frustrated with a ruling from a court,\u201d Mr. Ryan said with a shrug. While the d\u00e9tente between an   president and its   leaders on Capitol Hill may seem wholly transactional, some Republicans say the fury on the left toward Mr. Trump along with the denunciations from many news outlets has helped forge his bond with the voters that he and congressional Republicans share, particularly in the   House. When the president addressed congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia last month, Mr. Trump\u2019s aside about news coverage  \u2014   \u201cnothing fair about the media,\u201d he said with a sneer  \u2014   earned perhaps the most enthusiastic applause. \u201cWhile it may upset The New York Times, Hollywood, the cast of \u2018Hamilton\u2019 and the groups marching in the streets, it is not upsetting to the constituents that elected these members and senators,\u201d Sam Geduldig, a Republican lobbyist, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior. \u201cThere is a feeling that if those groups are against you, you\u2019re doing the right thing. \u201d More skeptical Republicans believe that lawmakers are deluding themselves if they treat Mr. Trump as a normal president  \u2014   quirky but tolerable, like a colorful uncle at Thanksgiving dinner. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly ignoring him, humoring him occasionally while the rest of the family gets along fine, enjoys the turkey and watches the game,\u201d said William Kristol, the former editor of The Weekly Standard. \u201cBut he\u2019s not just a bit player or a guest. He\u2019s the president. \u201d And in the Capitol, he can never be ignored for long. Strolling to a meeting last week, Mr. Corker was asked about the latest Trump controversy: The president had just attacked the retailer Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka\u2019s accessories and clothing line. The senator flashed a broad smile. \u201cDid he really?\u201d he asked.'"}, "time": 1742562098.379179}
