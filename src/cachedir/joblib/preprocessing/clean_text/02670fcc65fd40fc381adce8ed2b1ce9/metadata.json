The Bastion is a mobile defense system armed with two anti-ship missiles with a range of up to 300 km (188 miles). The Bal anti-ship missile has a similar range. \\nSweden\u2019s Defence Minister said his country was worried by the presence of the warships in the Baltic Sea, complaining the move was likely to keep tension in the region high. \\n\u201cThis is \u2026 worrying and is not something that helps to reduce tensions in our region,\u201d Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told Sweden\u2019s national TT news agency. \u201cThis affects all the countries round the Baltic.\u201d \\nSwedish media said the Kalibr missiles had the range to hit targets across the Nordic region. The Russian Defence Ministry said in August that the two corvettes had been used to fire cruise missiles at militants in Syria. \\nPolish Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz, in Brussels for a NATO meeting, called the deployment \u201can obvious cause for concern,\u201d the PAP news agency reported. \u201cMoving such ships into the Baltic changes the balance of power,\u201d he said. \\nEarlier this month, Russia moved nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles into Kaliningrad leading to protests from Lithuania and Poland.'"}, "time": 1742561875.9867764}
