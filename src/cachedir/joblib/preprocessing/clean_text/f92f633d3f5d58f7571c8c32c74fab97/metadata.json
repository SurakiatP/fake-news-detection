Speaking in the Oval Office, Donald J. Trump praised Mr. O\u2019Reilly as \u201ca good person\u201d and declared, \u201cI don\u2019t think Bill did anything wrong,\u201d days after The New York Times reported that five women had received settlements after making harassment claims against him. News of the payouts, totaling about $13 million, generated a storm of criticism toward Fox News, which recently renewed Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s contract, and prompted more than two dozen advertisers to withdraw their support of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s prime time show, the   program in cable news. Few have spoken out publicly in support of the Fox star. The president had no qualms. \u201cPersonally, I think he shouldn\u2019t have settled,\u201d Mr. Trump told Times reporters in a   interview. \u201cBecause you should have taken it all the way I don\u2019t think Bill did anything wrong. \u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s a person I know well,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe is a good person. \u201d The president is a   fan of Fox News, sitting for interviews with its   hosts and conferring privately by phone with Rupert Murdoch, the network\u2019s executive chairman. Mr. Trump has bragged to associates that he now refers to Mr. Murdoch, one of the world\u2019s most powerful media moguls, by his first name, according to a person who is friendly with both men. But the president has a particular rapport with Mr. O\u2019Reilly, whose hectoring braggadocio and   nostalgia for a bygone American era mirror Mr. Trump\u2019s own. A regular guest on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d Mr. Trump has attended baseball games with Mr. O\u2019Reilly, praised his collection of   political books, and, as   granted him a prominent interview that aired during Fox\u2019s Super Bowl pregame show. The men share a taste for vanilla milkshakes, bantering   about how many of the confections Mr. O\u2019Reilly has bought for his friend. The two have something more ominous in common, too: Each has been accused by women of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. Like the president, Mr. O\u2019Reilly maintains that the accusations against him are without merit. When damaging video footage of Mr. Trump bragging about sexual assault surfaced during the campaign, Mr. Trump called it \u201clocker room talk\u201d and apologized for the remarks. Mr. O\u2019Reilly, on air that evening, allowed that the tape was \u201can embarrassment\u201d for the Republican nominee. But he also criticized The Washington Post, the newspaper that published the footage. It is remarkable for a sitting president to weigh in on sexual harassment allegations from the Oval Office, especially allegations at the center of a churning controversy. But Mr. Trump\u2019s advice to his friend on Wednesday  \u2014   that Mr. O\u2019Reilly \u201cshouldn\u2019t have settled\u201d  \u2014   was consistent with the    ethos of a president, and former real estate magnate, who relishes the counterattack. It also hinted at a deeper symbiosis between the White House and Fox News. Mr. Trump often praises the network, recently urging his 27 million Twitter followers to tune in for a Saturday evening show last month, the president cited a Fox commentator, Andrew Napolitano, as backup for an unproven allegation that British intelligence spied on his campaign. In turn, Fox News\u2019s prime time and morning hosts are blatant champions of the administration  \u2014   to the extent that NBC News\u2019s chairman, Andrew Lack, recently compared the network to \u201cstate broadcasting. \u201d The president and Mr. Murdoch have drawn closer, too. Mr. Murdoch, a savvy political observer, deepened their relationship in the months after Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination, and people who know them say the two now speak frequently. Mr. Murdoch\u2019s former wife, Wendi Deng, is so close with Ivanka Trump that the president\u2019s daughter became a trustee of the Murdoch children\u2019s fortune. (Ms. Trump stepped down from the role in December.) Mr. Murdoch, meanwhile, had mentored Ms. Trump\u2019s future husband, Jared Kushner, in the art of media moguldom after his purchase of The New York Observer in 2006. Mr. Kushner, now a powerful White House aide, would later serve as Mr. Murdoch\u2019s chief conduit to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. These entwinements have fueled intrigue about how the president might influence Mr. Murdoch\u2019s corporate interests. Mr. Trump now oversees the Justice Department, just as Fox News faces an investigation by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan over its handling of financial settlements for harassment claims. Mr. Murdoch\u2019s entertainment conglomerate, 21st Century Fox, is also closing in on a coveted prize in Europe, the British satellite television giant Sky. But British regulators are scrutinizing the potential acquisition, and the firestorm around Mr. O\u2019Reilly may speak poorly of the corporate culture over which Mr. Murdoch presides. Fox News has often provided cover for Mr. Trump as the president navigated a host of early controversies. Mr. Trump\u2019s kind words for Mr. O\u2019Reilly on Wednesday seemed a reciprocal gesture of sorts, from a leader who values loyalty.'"}, "time": 1742563304.6368}
