You may have noticed a man holding a \u201cBLACKS FOR TRUMP\u201d sign behind the racist rabble-rouser at his events, with a website URL \u201cGODS2.com\u201d underneath it. If you\u2019ve wondered just what kind of black Americans could bring themselves to support Trump or if this election could get any weirder, well, hold on to your seat. \\nThe man holding the sign is \u201cMichael the Black Man,\u201d also known as Maurice Woodside or Michael Symonette. LittleGreenFootballs did some research and discovered that Michael isn\u2019t your ordinary concerned citizen. He\u2019s a former member of a murderous cult , Yahweh ben Yahweh, led by preacher Hulon Mitchell Jr. \\nMichael, along with 15 other Yahweh followers, was charged for allegedly conspiring in two murders; his brother, who was also in the cult, told jurors that Michael had helped beat one man who was later killed and stuck a sharpened stick into another man\u2019s eyeball. But jurors found Michael (and six other Yahweh followers) innocent. They sent Mitchell away for 20 years in the federal pen. \\nMichael later reinvented himself as a radio host and an anti-gay, anti-Obama preacher and soon found himself in the spotlight at Republican events, whose organizers were delighted to have found another person of color to attack Obama without being obviously racist. His website, GODS2.com, is filled with the delusional, vaguely anti-Semitic rantings of a madman and homages to Yahweh. \\nThis may not mean much in the long run, but it\u2019s worth pointing out just how outrageous the hypocrisy of the Trump campaign is. Trump attacked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton when the father of the Orlando nightclub shooter appeared in the stands behind her at a rally out of chance, accusing her of associating with the father of a deranged murderer \u2013 but this man is actually being planted behind Trump because of his skin color.
