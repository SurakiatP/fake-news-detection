[The drill is designed to prepare the area for an attack involving multiple locations and \u201cteams of perpetrators\u201d and will occur across six undisclosed locations in D. C. northern Virginia, and Maryland, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments announced in a press release.  Hundreds of volunteer actors, emergency medical personnel, police, and fire officials will participate in the drill. \u201cLaw enforcement officials practice and exercise their skills on their own regularly because that\u2019s the best way to ensure we are always ready to respond quickly and professionally,\u201d Scott Boggs, the Council of Government\u2019s Managing Director of Homeland Security and Public Safety, said in the release. \u201cOn April 26, we\u2019ll go one step further and stage a very realistic emergency event involving multiple sites and actors posing as the casualties. However, there is no reason for residents to be alarmed because the exercise will occur in a controlled environment,\u201d Boggs added. Officials say the drill will start at 7:30 a. m. Wednesday and go until afternoon. The drill has been planned for more than a year and was designed as a way to \u201caddress terror attacks such as what unfolded in 2015 in Paris\u201d in restaurants, cafes, and concert halls, Newsweek reported.'"}, "time": 1742562012.3830345}
