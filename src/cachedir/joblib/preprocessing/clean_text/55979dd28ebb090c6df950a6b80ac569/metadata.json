Charles McDowell, pastor of Barney United Methodist Church in Barney, Ga. was safe at home in nearby Valdosta on Sunday. So was the modest church where he preaches to his flock of a few dozen. But many of his members were suffering  \u2014   their homes damaged, including roofs torn away, and their electricity off. There was little for him to do but try to reach out to them on their cellphones. \u201cAs a church,\u201d Mr. McDowell said, \u201cwe\u2019re praying for each other. \u201d Catherine Howden, a spokeswoman for Georgia\u2019s emergency management agency, said 14 people had died and 23 had been injured in central and southern parts of the state. She said there had been up to 20 reports of tornadoes. Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Sunday for seven counties: Atkinson, Berrien, Brooks, Colquitt, Cook, Lowndes and Thomas. \u201cThe state is making all resources available to the impacted areas,\u201d Mr. Deal said in a statement. He added that he was prepared to expand or extend the emergency declaration, and that he was likely to seek federal help. On Sunday afternoon, during a ceremony to swear in senior White House staff members, President Trump said he had spoken with Mr. Deal, and noted that Florida and Alabama had also been hit. Mr. Trump said he had expressed to Mr. Deal \u201cour sincere condolences for the lives taken\u201d and promised to help Georgia. He added that he planned to reach out to Florida\u2019s governor, Rick Scott. George Wetzel, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Peachtree City, Ga. said that in the past three days, a strong   system had moved east across the South, which had been unseasonably warm, with moisture moving north from the Gulf of Mexico. A statement from Mississippi\u2019s emergency agency said a tornado had caused extensive damage in the southern part of the state early Saturday, killing at least four people in or near Hattiesburg and injuring more than 20 others. Gov. Phil Bryant called for a state of emergency as power lines and debris littered roads. In Georgia, an intense round of thunderstorms that started Saturday morning produced a number of tornadoes, and a second round overnight produced flooding rains, including more than six inches in 24 hours just east of Albany. A third wave of storms began in some parts of the state early Sunday. On Sunday morning in Adel, Ga. Jeff Lane, a county commissioner, surveyed the wreckage at the Sunshine Acres trailer park, where he said all of the county\u2019s deaths had occurred. (He said eight had died, but Ms. Howden said later that the toll was actually seven.) Search and rescue crews were still making their way through the community. Photographs showed an open field surrounded by thin trees, strewn with splintered wood, metal sheeting and destroyed cars. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bomb had been dropped out here at ground level,\u201d Mr. Lane said by phone. \u201cYou\u2019ve got   frames that look like spaghetti noodles. We\u2019ve tried to evacuate as many as we can. But it\u2019s raining real hard, and we\u2019re getting ready to start another round of storms. \u201d Mr. McDowell, the pastor in Barney, a small community known for its peaches, said he had canceled Sunday services because of power failures and the continuing storms. \u201cA lot of my people have physical damage,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the roofs are ripped off, trees are down, and of course the power is off now. \u201d The weather also caused damage in Alabama, Louisiana and Texas, but it was not clear Sunday whether anyone had been killed or injured in those states. NOAA warned of a \u201chigh risk\u201d of severe weather in Georgia and parts of Alabama and Florida. Since Saturday morning, 30 tornadoes were reported in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi, the agency said.'"}, "time": 1742563814.0493555}
