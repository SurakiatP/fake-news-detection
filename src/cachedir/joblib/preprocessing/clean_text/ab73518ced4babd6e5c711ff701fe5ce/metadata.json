However, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll think that of Trump in two years,\u201d he added. \u201cThe more immediate dangers seem to be: police statist assaults on undocumented Latino immigrants, a registry of Muslims, and a potential designation of Black Lives Matter and civil rights activists as quasi-terrorists. The other great, existential threat is runaway climate change because Trump has pledged to thoroughly deregulate energy.\u201d Saving Mumia and Others from a Curable Disease \\nActivists in the Free Mumia movement plan a rally on December 9, in Philadelphia, to pressure prison officials to treat the political prisoner and thousands of other inmates suffering from hepatitis C. \u201cHealthwise, Mumia is not doing good at all,\u201d said Pam Africa , of Concerned Family and Friends of Mumia Abu Jamal. \u201cHe has the appearance of good health, but he\u2019s itching all over\u201d and \u201chis health is declining.\u201d A judge ruled that Pennsylvania prison officials are obligated to treat Abu Jamal, but he used a technicality to avoid ordering that the cure actually be administered. Pam Africa said next month\u2019s rally will also highlight unsafe, blackish water in prisons. At one facility, she said, \u201cyoung people coming into the prison are losing their hair.\u201d U.S. Election Ran on \u201cFear\u201d and \u201cBetrayal\u201d \\n\u201cIt is accurate to say that economic discontent played a part\u201d in Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat at the polls, said Mumia Abu Jamal . But he thinks other factors were at least as important. \u201cThe Trump campaign represented, not just fear, but profound paranoia, and also white revenge for the darkening of America.\u201d However, \u201cif Trumpism represented vengeance, then Clintonism represented betrayal,\u201d because the Democrats failed to stand up on issues vital to their base constituencies. Torture, Anyone? \\nFormer Kansas Republican congressman Mike Pompeo is likely to be named CIA director in the Trump administration. \u201cHe\u2019s a big fan of torture,\u201d said Ray McGovern , a former CIA analyst who now spends most of his time trying to rein in the national security state. McGovern told Paul Jay, of The Real News Network, that Pompeo \u201cvisited Guantanamo, he said it was great, and then said, \u201cAs far as I can see, those prisoners are gaining weight.\u2019\u201d President Obama must share the blame. \u201cIf Obama had the strength of his convictions, he would have gotten rid of the torturers in the CIA,\u201d said McGovern. \u201cHe let them stay, and now they\u2019re having a celebration.\u201d Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey. A new edition of the program airs every Monday at 11:00am ET on PRN. Length: one hour.'"}, "time": 1742564122.0687256}
